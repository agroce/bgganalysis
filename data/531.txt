151117 Its an interesting Knizia Auction game.

100725 OK game, lots of moving parts to it, but I think a little to complicated for me to be interested in playing often.  I like Knizia when he makes really sleek games with basic powerful mechanics, not when they get too fiddly.  It is interesting to play with the dutch auction, but I have to say that I don't think I am particularly that style of auction for my personal preferences.

Very good game - plays fast, lots of strategy, I'd play almost anytime.  Easy to learn - kids (about ge 9 and up) can play if they are careful with the timer.
So why would I trade it - too many games, too little time.  Seldom gets played.

RATING: 9
The cards in this highly themed game are kinda flimsy, but that's my only component complaint. Unquestionably, this is both my favourite area control game and auction game. Soooo much to choose from! And the auction clock makes analysis paralysis during auctions a thing of the past. There is the constant danger of overbidding, but simply never winning an auction is never an option, IMO: I have fared quite poorly employing that very strategy! A wonderful combo of strategy, tactics, and even psychology (during the unusual auctions). My only significant complaint about Merchants of Amsterdam is that OCCASIONALLY (and thankfully, ONLY occasionally) a profound string of luck in the card drawing can really throw the game.

RATING: 5
The Dutch auction is an interesting mechanism, but the tension of it leads to overbidding.  In early games at least, the winner tends to buy hardly anything at auction.  There is the appearance of many options, but the draw of the cards limits them to such an extent that the decision making feels fairly mundane.  After four plays, this game is just lacking any spark for me.

Nice bidding game, but can get out of hand when everyone bids over 120. Not a beginner game at all.

Improved after a few plays: it didn't work as a 5-player game, but works pretty well as a 3-4 player one. Still not his best, but it's got good flavor, and the luck of the card draw seems to only enhance some of the decision making.

The auction clock works well in this game.  Not just a gimmick.  There are many interesting decisions throughout the game- how to value the auction, whether to auction/take or discard each card on your turn, whether or not to take a loan, and where to position your markers.

the auction clock can be fun, and the underlying game is decent.  the choices feel pretty significant.  love the keep/auction/discard element, the deck-based event progression, etc.  i sought it out immediately after 1 play, and thoroughly enjoyed the second.  the stale production is enough for me to keep it at arm's length though, and i've come full circle to think that a normal auction might be better.  but if it were a normal auction, the game could be boring.  so maybe it is a bit of a gimmick game.  a retheme might do a ton for me though, who knows?

Interesting game, but worrying about area majorities in twelve places with five players is too much for my little brain to cope with.  Add to that the need to continually count how much development there has been in eight of those locations and it all gets to be a bit too much for what the game is actually offering.

A buddy of mine passed this on to me without even opening it, partly to make room on his game shelf, but also because he had heard some disparaging remarks about this offering.  Played it for the first time recently and we all had a blast.  Some out there are concerned about the "clock", but I found it to work just fine, AND because of the nature of the countdown mechanism I believe we all paid more for certain cards than was needed.  That is the whole idea with that kind of auction; fearing others will take a card from you, or get a card that will help themselves.  I look forward to exploring a more refined bidding system, maximizing what is spent into the cash I need to stay ahead.  I have a hard time with the idea that the clock makes this a 'dexterity' game.  You only have to decide how much you are willing to pay for a particular card and push a button to 'announce' that fact.  Can you stand firm with that decision as the clock ticks down, or will you let the flinching of your opponents force you into an unwanted bid?  A wonderful diversion with a lot of potential strategies available. [Gift]

A real juggling act to maximise the gain for your guilder. The clock auction is a very fresh mechanism although I'm not sure how the seats and board can be arranged to give everyone an even hand on the stopper. A good opportunity for screwage at a number of levels.

This game definitely works, and I had a decent time playing and would be happy to play again if asked. Unfortunately there are some significant flaws in the design which hold it back from being a really great game. The arrangement of the sand timer cards in the deck can make a big difference on how the game feels, so when we had a ton of them front-loaded in the deck we weren't able to strategically maneuver for points, they just kind of happened. The game is overloaded with little rules and exceptions which kind of take away from the smooth flow of the game and make it unnecessarily complex. But the biggest problem I had was with the components. The deck of tiny cards are the worst, the tokens for each player are extremely thin and cheap, and the auction clock stuck on us almost every single auction. It's a shame because the game has potential to be one of the most interesting and unique auction/area control games ever, but it falls short because of these flaws.

The idea is neat with this one, and the auction mechanisms are very unique, but I am not a huge fan of auction games were it is tough to figure out the value of things.  In saying that, I did have fun playing this one, but am not yet sure if its something I want to keep.  The production quality is awful, but the dutch auction "tool" is cool.

Merchants is an area-control game with a heavy auction factor. It uses a clock for Dutch auctions, which is a mechanic I'd never seen before, and which drives some players nuts.

The board is pretty, the cardboard chits used to show control are adequate, but the clock is cool. My only concern is that it will get broken or damaged - if I buy a copy, I'll probably sub in a cheap egg timer or something instead.

There is quite a bit of luck in the cards drawn, and this can unbalancing. I recommend the game, but warn people that  luck is pretty dominant and the components are not all they could be.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Unique bidding game using a mechanical auction clock that has to be struck to stop the countdown. The player stopping the clock pays the amount displayed for the item that is up for auction.

Besides the bidding mechanic not much else stands out. It's basic fair area control and feels somewhat bland nowadays. Since money is the currency used for bidding as well as for determining the winner you constantly have to guess the value of the item up for auction. Towards the and it's easier to calculate the amount an item is worth, but because of area control each player has different interests. The question then is whether you want to pay anyway to not let your direct competitor get away with an item too cheaply.

What I don't like is how luck can influence some games. Each area is scored a fixed number of times, but you never know when this happens exactly, which can really be a frustrating experience.

Thought I'd like this more ... dutch auction 'clock' is cool - but values seem wrong ... why stop at 200, and why go down below 100 ... or rather why not print 2 value tracks on the clock and solve the problem?

Overall, too long for what it does - with too many things to track for optimising your score and trying to value the cards you are buying and how much value they are for others ...

Would not want to play this with anyone who is AP prone it would drag into unbearable length.

Overall, would play again, but no desire to own a copy.

Excellent game with a novel auction clock. It drives some people batty, but not me ;-). It's fun to watch people blow all their money buying stuff that never pays back and several times I'vce won by not buying very much at all. Very deceptive. Having said that, it's qyuite hard to adapt strategy during play of this game as you never really know how well you're doing, just have to play to plan and see what happens. Unless of course you play with open bank accounts but that's not real kosher ;-)

The standard Knizia majority control design,
with a nice mechanism by which each player gets
three articles to dispose of: one goes to the trash,
one gets used by the player, and the final one goes
to auction - a dutch auction (running backwards).

Beyond that, the tension of the Dutch auction, moderated
by a timer ticking backwards through values, adds an
interesting twist.

Enjoyable game.  The clock is a bit annoying, but it is so central to the theme that I can't see playing without it.

Good game overall, but I would rather play Ra or Medici.

Neat twist on area majority, with the progress track determining what is scored when.

I managed to play this for the first time recently and was pleasantly surprised.  I and everyone who played rather enjoyed it.

It's basically an area influence game where in your turn you get one free placement for yourself, and another is put up for Dutch auction.

It's the auction phase that makes this entertaining.  The timer goes down...someone stops it.  You never know what other people value something at, and you don't know if you overpaid.

I feared that the game would feel "dry", given that it's a Knizia - but it didn't and the integration with historical events during the game really kept it all alive.

The countdown auction is neat but the dexterity part wasn't really up my alley. What I really didn't care for was that it seemed (in my 5 player) game, everybody was overpaying so the countdown clock really didn't get below 200 very often. In this situation, not doing anything all game long was a valid tactic for winning and to me that is unforgivable.

There's a core problem with people getting excited by the clock and bidding too high.  It can be a difficult temptation to resist as they watch and hear the clock count down.  The problem is that if they fail to resist it ruins the game as the guaranteed win path is to not bid.  However, if your group can resist that temptation and only bid reasonably then this is a good, carefully balanced and interesting auction game with an unusually strong theme for a Knizia.  Not worth playing with three, Okay with 4, and best of all with 5.

Its imperative to read the little historical event summary from the rulebook as you go around the time track. I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed this one. I came in a dismal last, as I clearly was over-paying on the auctions...but next time I'll do better. I like the spatial tension on the board and the scoring bonus mechanic. The auctions move along quickly because of the clock.

RATING: 7
Merchants is a classic Knizia auction title that often gets the short-shrift because of his glut of other high quality using that mechanic. While Merchants is not in the stratosphere occupied by Modern Art and Ra, it is certainly another excellent second tier option.

The basics of the game are rather simple. Each round the auctioneer flips over 3 cards. One of them will be discarded, one will be freely used by them, and the third will be up for bid using the Dutch auction timer, where the price slowly winds down until someone stops it and pays the asking price.

Players are bidding for the right to put chits on colonial areas and at warehouses in Amsterdam, which give them influence which will score them money a few times in the game, they also get to advance their influence on the four commodities tracks when they do this, or can just add influence to the commodities track as another potential action. 

There are also a few monetary inducements to putting your chits in particular, otherwise unappealing configurations (i.e.: to spread out colonial influence to all 4 continents, to split up your warehouses around bridges rather than to keep them in the contiguous groups that are checked when scoring comes) which adds another layer of intrigue.

The game is governed by time cards that are part of the auction deck, and as the game progresses players score the three territories and also get to place (or lose) some of their chits.

So there are two primary components here, the board play and the auction. The board play is nothing particularly special. It's a simple majorities fight ala so many typical area influence games. The other part is the auction, which is dominated by the admittedly gimmicky, but nonetheless entertaining Dutch clock, which is extremely loud and has a way of snapping people's attention into abrupt focus when it gets going. Despite the lack of anything truly original aside from the clock, this is still a good second tier option once you've played the big two. I think it's easily on par with Traumfabrik and Medici, and offers its own twist with the reverse price auction.

Some interesting ideas and at least an effort at creating a historical sequence of events, but the game is really screwed up by too-frequent scoring rounds and a lack of dynamism.  The result is a boring, redundant game.  It's really a shame, because there's some definite fun to be had with the auction clock.

This game is worthy of consideration with Medici, Ra, Modern Art and Traumfabrik. So Especially if you like that type of game this is a good one. You have to compete in several arenas at once and there are other options for out manuevering your opponents without having to outbid them.

I liked this quite a bit.  I think it has some depth to it that I didn't get a chance to really discover in just one playing.  The auction clock was cool, but I didn't win a single one, and it impacted me negatively.  Of course, one time someone nailed the clock and scattered some markers on the commodities board, so that may have had something to do with it as well.  I want to play this again and soon.

This is an alright game. I would play it again, but would not choose it to play. The general game play is good, but I found that I really didn't like the auction in it much. Very dexterity/gambling based. (you often pay more then you would if you actually had the chance to think about it more because of the actions of the other players. Very prone to being trigger happy.) I felt this took away from the game. I would have liked this game better with a different type of auction then using a buzzing time counter that you have to hit faster than the others to win.(depending on what you want to pay as well...if you even remember that once the time actually begins)

First play was fun.  I'm afraid that I didn't explain the rules very well, but after another go at covering the rules we got down to business and this game shone.  The auction added a nice tenseness to the game.  Whereas I overspent in the auction, the winner concentrated on building a clear commodity majority or two which paid off in spades as he won those majorities throughout the game - continually spending money whenever necessary to maintain those leads.  Too many of us overspent in the auction for too little return.  Looking forward to playing this neat area control game again.

Good game with a gimmick - the Dutch Auction clock. The typical Knizia &quot;bid for the right to place tokens in different areas of the board in order to score for majorities in different regions&quot;  kind of game.  But the clock is a neat extra!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Neat euro style game.  The game has a physical timing clock which adds a real time element to actions taken and uses a "slap jack" mechanism for resolution of the timer clock each play.  The game is fun, unique and over all a good game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This game is a curious mix of auctions and area majority - except you're managing area majority in 3 distinct areas. To get tokens on the board you have to win auctions, which come down to who jumps in first as the clock ticks down.

Meanwhile, a timeline around the board is advancing the game at unplanned intervals, and it also decides what part of the board is scored. It is this aspect that I found the most frustrating, as the scorings could come in rapid succession or be faced far apart - in ways less structured than other games like Alhambra. In our game for example, almost 1/3 of the timeline cards came up in the first few turns, which was just ridiculous.

This game is a basic Rio Grande game. You have your resources, you have a no-holds-bar non-elimination game (sounds like an oxy-moron) and of course, there is at least one wooden piece. The bit that I enjoyed the most from this game was the auction clock. This little device adds an interesting twist to "resource" games, where you're unsure whether or not your profit will pay out in the end.  Though, come to think of it, the auction clock sounds a hell of a lot like the Taboo timer (I know, I'm admitting I played tabOOOOOOOOOOO!!!). On that note, I did enjoy this game and would certainly see more plays in the future (I still hate Taboo!)

Production: A game where the bits clutter up the board, rather than decorate it.  The board makes creative use of space, but looks too busy.  I do like the auction timer, and all the components (except the money) are durable.  Play: A lot of interesting area-control mechanisms are at work here, along with auction and divide & share mechanisms, but these various elements do not add up to a fun game for me.  (2+0+2) (1 play)

RATING: 8
Fun bidding game with lots of "little races" for first/second with three race types and two different levels of competition on each, plus they are all interconnected in some way so that placing a token in one race bumps you up in another.

Only downside is dependence on a "Dutch clock" that counts down the bid and has a tendency to get stuck around the 130 range. Even with a replacement this strikes me as the the most likely thing to break and needs a replacement mechanism, although I do like it in it's current form were it not for it's limited longevity. Brings the game down from a '9' for me.

This is a very well designed auction game, as one would expect from Knizia.  There is just enough going on to keep your interest for an hour, and not too much that you feel overwhelmed.  

The countdown mechanical timer is going to be a cool feature for most people, but a lot of people will dislike that aspect of the game.  I like it, but sometimes the angle of where you sit makes it hard to know when to hit the timer.  That's unfortunate, and could be solved now with a digital timer.

Nice game and a cool clock. The clock is also the problem with this game as I don't like it when everyone try to hit the clock at once or when someone intercepts you just because they can move their hand faster etc. The increase 3 step card feels a bit too powerful compared to the other cards.

RATING: 7
Cool auction mechanic!  The timer counts down how much the token will cost.  When the price falls down to what is acceptable, you press the timer and pay that much.  I way overpaid for the auctions because I liked pressing the button so much.  :)  This game is probably a 6 w/out the timer.  The timer is such an awesome way to do an auction...that I want to rate the game an 8.  But the strategic part of the game is your basic area majority, so I'm in the "usually would play" camp...thus a 7.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Excellent game featuring a Dutch Auction bidding mechanism, using a clockwork bidding device. The game follows the development of the Dutch trading network throughout the globe, as well as within Amsterdam. Players get to turn up three "action" cards; one they trash, one they keep for themselves, and one they auction. You are trying to achieve majorities, which pay off when the appropriate events occur. There is the good dollop of history in this game.

RATING: 3
Another area-control type game, in the El Grande mold. However, this time it's Knizia auctions in order to buy your pawns. There's a bit of a push-your-luck element thrown in for good measure. Nothing wrong with the ingredients perse, but the result of this cocktail is a failure. A bland game with plenty of regions and tons of little pieces to move and rearrange, yet little fun or interaction.

[2 plays] Good game; I learned the second time that it can be rough when luck goes against you (did not get a single ship card the ENTIRE game), but that's true wherever there's luck.  I think the way the game plays out over the span of historical time is cool.  The auction clock is a nifty gimmick, but next time we play I would really like to try substituting blind bidding.  This would require everyone to think before the auction starts how much they are willing to pay, just like with the clock--but it would take away the spatial/dexterity element (and the whole problem of where to fairly position the clock), the "chicken" element (though it is kinda fun to twitch your hand and make your opponents go paranoid berserk and bid ridiculous sums), and the real-time stress.  Not to mention the background noise that's annoying for the gamers at the next table.

Played 1 time. i thought I might like this since I like auction games, but sadly, for me this one doesn&#039;t work. First of all has the old-Kniziaesque feel to it -- very dry and abstract. I like several of his newer games, but most of his old title felt that way to me. But the part I least enjoyed is NOT his fault. I simply don&#039;t like influence games, and this I dislike even more than El Grande or San Marco. If you like influence games, you&#039;ll probably like it though. Very strategic, just not my cup of tea.

Knizia strikes again with a brilliant game.  The auction gimmick works fine although I can see how easily it could break if it isn't handle with some care.

Yet another Reiner-blends-mechanisms-into-a-good-game thing going on here. The Dutch auction clock is certainly a gimmick, but it works in this context.

And yes, it is indeed easy to overbid but that should correct itself with experience. Looks like a keeper.

You don't see Dutch auctions being used in board games very often and the annoyingly noisy clock is most certainly part of the reason (and not because it is annoyingly noisy but because a gadget like this is necessary). There's no denying that it works quite beautifully, though.

The game built on top of the auction, however, is just a bog-standard area majority game with a few Knizian niggles thrown in for good measure, and therefore not quite up to the level of many of his other auction offerings.

I love this game. I'll play it anytime it hits the table.
There are plenty of interesting choices to make and several strategies to use. There is also very little downtime during the game.
The dutch auction gives me the same nervous feeling that I get when I try to bid on an eBay item during its last 30 seconds.
My computerized auction clock with hand-held clickers makes the game work a lot better.

I like the game; there's a lot of complex and interconnected stuff going on, and players have a whole menu of short- and long-term goals from which to choose. The board is a battlefield with hot spots and mini-rivalries, and the two keys seem to be nabbing the cards that help you out in two areas at once and auctioning off stuff that other people are anxious about. 

The critical thing, however, is making sure that everyone understands how easy it is to overpay; in the best possible case, the most you can make on any one majority over the course of the game is something like 500,000 florin; if you end up making four bids of 120,000 to maintain that majority, you're getting a 4% return on your investment. If you're paying that much to maintain a majority in a third-ranked region, you're talking about a significant loss. On the other hand, most cards affect two different areas of the board, so it's not easy to figure out how much you ought to be paying for stuff. For reference, in our last game the average going price for cards was in the neighborhood of 100-110 florin (the range being 70-150), and the guy who sat out most of the auctions came in last. 

My one criticism of the game is that the difficult valuation and the unpredictable scoring (you know what's going to be scored next, you just don't know how soon) undercut the drama in that it's harder to identify the "big moments" and it  makes the game have a somewhat flat story arc. Also, if you want to nitpick, the cards are way too small. 

Incidentally, I have what I call a "gentleman's variant" where if one player's hand is already moving, the other players don't try and beat him to the clock; it takes out the unnecessary dexterity element and keeps the clock from getting smashed to flinders. 

So far I've played with both four and three players, and both have worked well; the board doesn't get as filled up with three, but you're better able to gauge where you are in relation to your opponents and so the feeling of competition is accentuated.

RATING: 6
Very interesting game. There are several elements that interact well together, with that typical Knizia balance. The theme does work pretty well. Unfortunately, in my one play of this (3-player), one player got all of the 3x commodity cards, which seemed to heavily unbalance the game in his favor. I don't know if or how this could have been compensated for. Bad random draw for us, but not sure whether that breaks the game or not.

UPDATE:
Played again with 5, and the game was much different. It seemed pretty well balanced between all the different opportunities. One player drove the prices of all goods up by always paying top dollar for every auction. This seemed to break the game, but he didn't end up winning. It at least broke the spirit of the game.
TIP: Don't take the loan. There really wasn't any need for the extra money, and it ended up costing me money at the end of the game. A completely wasted action.

This game is surprisingly fun when you consider that it combines multiple overused euro mechanisms with a gimmicky auction toy/dexterity/psychology factor.  Its an area majority game, with multiple areas to choose from.  You place stuff in the areas by drawing cards.  Each turn you draw three cards.  As you draw them you must decide whether to throw them away, keep them, or auction them.  You do one of each.  The area majority scoring bit is pretty typical.  The most heavily invested in areas pay the most out, so you want to fight some, but not too much.  The auction happens by way of a big clock thing that counts down, then you slap it to stop the clock and pay the amount shown.  This is pretty goofy, as we had to rock paper scissors several times when we slapped the clock at exactly the same second.  The theme of the game: you are dutch traders doing dutch auctions.  Get it?  GET IT?  Thats theme!  

Considering this is a nigh themeless rehash of overused mechanics combined with a gimmicky toy to drive the auctions, it is pretty fun.  I would play it again.

This is an initial rating, but I sure enjoyed this game. There is quite a bit to keep track of, and when going into auctions it is essential to decide how much you will pay and not get bummed if you lose an auction that went for more than you were willing to pay, but it is rewarding play. I was irritated by the timer at first but I had fun with it as the game progressed. I wish that there were some wooden pieces instead of cardboard chits, but they are used to represent all of your interests in the game so I guess it's understandable, mayby wooden discs could have been used. Oh well, very nice game.

Another interesting brain-twister from Knizia. This is an auction game with a twist: the "Dutch" auction is a mechanical count-down device that with each tick, lowers the price of an item up for bid. Players anxiously wait trying to double-guess their opponents on what price to pay. As with his other auction game, Modern Art, you don't want to pay too much, but you cannot afford to pay too little, as you will not get the action you need! A delicious dilemma indeed. The game is based around getting first and second place in three categories: shipping, trade offices, and warehouses. The active player (the mayor) must decide, as he/she draws the cards one at a time, whether they want to keep the card (for their own use), trash the card (to prevent others from benefiting), or auction the card using the aforementioned Dutch auction mechanic. The last option is risky, as an opponent may be willing to pay good money to gain dominance in one of the three categories that you also competing in! If they pay too much, that's good, but you also don't want them to get it at the right price! Where is that price? Oh, you could work out the math, but that would take the fun out of the game.

Scoring for the warehouse districts and the trade centers are interesting. Commodity tracks scoring, which is central to the game, is ho-hum, and the publisher made the commondity tracks too small for the tokens to fit very well. Interesting to have an actual dutch auction. It works like a closed fist auction except you never get to see what everyone else was willing to bid.

So hard not to over bid.  I mean really hard.  So hard you can almost win by just not bidding.

I do like the drafting and auctioning.

The scoring though is a bit too much.  It's annoying to keep determining the rank and then the payout.  And you have to do it over and over.

So it's perfectly.. okay.

RATING: 5
Not bad actually but a pretty run of the mill type game though and a sub par area control game, it reminds me of Reinlander in those ways actually another sub-par AC game.  

I was really looking forward to playing with the timer, a unique mechanic where a timer ticks down lower and lower until someone hits it to stop it, the price of an item starts high and gets lower as the timer ticks.  This gives the push your luck feel, it works well but it did sound better on paper than it actually was playing.  The rest of the game is quite average, everything works and there are lots of little scoring nuances to work towards.  

One problem which most of us thought was a big problem was the commodity card x 3, a very powerful card that comes up randomly at least 5 or 6 times.  The luck in the game was acceptable until these cards started coming, some players can get 2 or even 3 of these while some others get none, then there is no more contest in the market which is just silly.  My recommendation is to just take these out completely and do it right in your first game, then the game would be that much better, with the cards removed I might have rated 5.5 or 6, with them in 4.5 or 5.  

Terrible or maybe the WORST card stock quality I have ever seen, stop making these stupid little crap cards already publishers!

A good auction/majority leader game. The timer seems a little lame at first, that is until it's winding down and you have to make a quick decision! The timer also keeps the auctions moving along at a good clip. Overall, a good game but we've seen it done many times before. There are much better auctions games out there and if I want to go for territory control I'll play el Grande or Web of Power.

The card picks at the start of each round turn some players off because of the randomness, but there is still a lot of strategy there.  The auction device only adds to the tension.

RATING: 6
The game played much better than I thought it would reading the rules. The game is three slightly different, interrelated majority games tied together through a card deck where each turn you use one card to increase your influence in one area, another card is discarded, and a third card is auctioned off using a fragile, noisy machine to simulate a dutch auction, where the bidding starts high and then drops, going to the first bid. There are numerous ways to earn money throughout the game and the winner is not determined by grand, sweeping moves, but by slightly beating out more players than anyone else over the long haul. Events happen periodically that emulate the arc of dutch power - bonuses and good stuff early, loss and regression late. It's a nice little way to layer in a feeling of actual history.

Ultimately, the choices are too limited for this to score any higher. The game is enjoyable, but there's not much in it to make you want to come back for more.

The Dutch Auction timer is kind of gimmicky, but the system of area controls and scripted events is pretty interesting.

Kinda fun, but I am not cut out for auction games- I have a real problem making the funamental judgment- is what I am paying really the right amount for what I am buying- I get inclined to think "having this is good, so I must spend whatever it takes". It turns into buying a $20 bill for $50 in the end. The timer is really, really neat. The commodity icons are really, really weird (we settled on them as Bags, Party Favors, Scales and Towels).

A very enjoyable game that adds a timeline or historic simulation theme into an auction game.  Consistently getting good deals (especially early on) is the major focus.  But, you can also win if others are bidding high and you take the slow and steady approach by not overpaying or buying anything (which I tend to think brings balance to the game).

Pros:

Dutch auction with countdown clock. Press your luck game with the card draws. Fairly calculable benefit/loss system. Opportunities to spite opponents to get ahead. 

Cons:

Clock can lead to "who hit it first". Cards are fairly random and not alway beneficial to the current player.

I see this game as a predecessor to games like Ys and Endeavor yet still different enough and relevant enough for an occasional play. It certainly needs the right group, however.

Uses a count-down dutch auction mechanism. 
The device has been criticized as being a potential problem if it breaks. Here's how one user overcame the problem: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/403794/review

The mechanic seems really fun (and unique). However, some reviewers didn't like it.

I think it would be interesting to use the computerized auction mechanism with attached individual clickers.

Worth getting for the right price.

Alternative to auction device: Everyone in a clockwise fashion starts counting down from 200 (perhaps by 10 until 150, by 5 until 100, and then by 1). When it's your turn to count a number, you have the choice to say "Stop" in which case you get it for the last announced number.

Despite rumors of a defective clock in the game, I really wanted this one.  Having played it I found that I enjoy the game more than I thought I would.  Bidding with the clock van be loads of fun, and getting ahead in an area may not always win the game for you.  The clock stuck every time in the 180 position, but one squirt of WD-40 to the gears inside solved that problem, and it works fine.  I like the look of the game, and the tension of the auctions.  I just wish the rules had been translated better.

Auction game with area control as a scoring mechanism. I love the dutch auction and I think the clock is a nice tool for it. The theme is present in both the board and the mechanism and the mentioning of the historical happenings in the rulebook is very nice. It is very easy to explain the game, but the scoring is a bit more difficult to explain. The only reason that I give this not a 9 is that there are a lot of in-between scorings which require intensive counting and that takes a bit the rythem out of the game.

An underrated game I believe. I enjoy it a lot. Of course it is nice for a Dutchman to go through the history of the Dutch Golden Age, as we call it: the rise and fall of the Dutch East Indies Company (VOC), the spice monopolies held etc. But besides that, the game combines a auction game (with the typical Dutch downward counting auction clock, which is still widely used) with a majorities game on the board. Don't bid too much. Choose your majorities rather than going for the bonuses for being equally present in all the continents, resources or neighbourhoods. With all these bonuses for equal development Knizia is just wrongfooting you there.

Typical Knizia, with all this implies. Gameplay felt rather dry, with way too many decision matrices to be able to see the forest for the trees. I like it when it's difficult to evaluate an item's value (amun-re, modern art, etc.), but in this case figuring out the value is so convoluted that I didn't enjoy the process. Theme more present than with most knizia game, but at the same time I found it to be the typical knizia abstract. Maybe I had too high hopes for the game?

RATING: 6
A dutch auction game with some area control & a somewhat chaotic action selection mechanism. The game comes with a loud timer-thingy that has values on it 200->50. Auctions start at $200,000 dollars and decrease in value as the timer runs out. The first person to slap the timer stops the auction and pays the bank. Interesting psychology behind the dutch auction as I'm sure with prices starting high many of the auctions were over-valued. Hard to tell though. You can also hit the timer before it hits $200,000 (right away) to double the auction prices.

It's clear that one strategy is not to bid on the auctions (i.e. overpay) but then that wouldn't be too fun.  Overall a game with flaws that's perhaps just outdated now.

Merchants of Amsterdam has a lot going for it. It's well-balanced for three to five players, is relatively easy to explain (as long as players have another game or two of this sort under their belt), and plays pretty quickly. It's comparable to Santiago in these and other respects, but at this point I'd say I prefer Merchants of Amsterdam.

Most other games of this complexity are less interactive or add on another 30 minutes--at which point I feel like we should be playing something a bit meatier. In Merchants, you really have to be aware of the board and what other players are doing to succeed. As with lots of other Euros, there are bound to be some mental calculations going on as you try to maximize the payouts from your investments, but there's no multiplayer solitaire here. Every token you place effects everyone in the game, and every turn has an auction that engages all the other players.

Speaking of the auctions, a lot of people complain about the auctions' buzzer--it's too loud, it breaks, and so on--but we think it's fun, plus you can always print out some cards to replace it. If you can get beyond that, you've be able to enjoy this underrated mid-weight Euro. (Another benefit is that it's generally available for next to nothing. Ours cost $15--including shipping--on Amazon.)

Pretty standard Knizia auction game, though the Dutch auction adds an interesting wrinkle.

Knizia's game of Dutch auction bidding set in Amsterdam. Players are competing for majorities in warehouses, stock market commodities and world markets. As a player, during your turn, you draw cards to either 1) discard, 2) auction off or 3) take for yourself. Scoring rounds are triggered by the pawn moving along a track, which moves due to cards in the draw deck. Auctions are conducted by a grinding clock which winds down from $200 to $0. First player to press the clock pays the bid for the action. Now there are some neat concepts here. However, in a 5 player game, the 4th player has the advantage in tiebreaks in two regions, which is unbalancing. The clock itself is another story. We were not sure where to position it so it was fair to everyone, we've seen the gameboard get scattered in the excitement of reaching for the clock, and finally we've let one person run the clock, but even that has limits, when the person running the clock says "I am going to press the clock now", in slow motion. Also the first few times we played, players were not sure of the right amount to bid, so the player who didn't bid could win. So this game appears to be best with four experienced players, but only then is it a good game. It takes a lot of work to get to this stage, and it may not be worth it for some people.

Played 5-player game 3 times before logging. I love the Dutch auction system a lot. I didn't expect that I enjoy this game this much. Very easy to win without winning very few auctions if the selling prices are high, which is hard for the first time players.

A very tense and well-balanced auction game that I consider one of Knizia's best.  The clock is noisy at first, but you'll get used to it very quickly.  The only big concern is the chance of a player getting really unlucky and drawing something utterly worthless for the freebie card on his or her turn.  It usually won't happen, though.

You're trying to win firsts and seconds in 12 different areas to earn cash in a series of 8 payouts that are controlled by time cards through the deck. Most cash wins. To get your chips on the board, you'll get a freebie on your turn, but otherwise need to win a dutch count-down auction. The early game is marred / difficult because it's impossible to value the winning of a particular auction - you'll need to win more auctions in that category to make it payoff and who knows how much you'll need to pay for those. But if you buy nothing you can't win, so you need to buy stuff on a wing and a prayer, which is why the game gets mostly harshly rated I think. It gets easier to value from mid-game on when you can see what people are now more interested in and can more easily assess what the likely payback is. For the auction itself, we have 1 player hover over the clock and have people shout stop rather than have them lurching out over the gameboard and upsetting the board. Works much better. But 21 auctions (for 4 players anyway) is still a lot of auctions, another reason for my marking it down. Having said that, they do provide a different type of auction tension which is interesting, knowing that you can't just keep raising a must-win bid, but you *must* get in before everyone else and there's no second chances. It induces much over-bidding.

The clock is a nice gimmick, but the game around it is pretty pedestrian. My main beef is that you dont know if you payed the right amount for something. In a good bidding game you should at least come to a good guestimate before bidding and during the game you should have a feel of how your investment payed out. Thats not happening here - due to the "double majority rule" (The most markers in a region in total determine that the majority holder in that region gets the most points for his majority) and due to various boni its close to impossible to see how an investment payed out or not. 
So its basiccly a gut-feel-auction and for that there is not enough emotion in the whole process. Not a bad game, but nothing Id recommend either.

I liked my first play of this fun little game. You need to collect commodities and colonies -- all in time for the scoring rounds. It also has a great bidding mechanic with a crazy timer (that I could never get to set correctly.) I played poorly but still really liked the game.

RATING: 7
What I liked: Historical feel especially in regards to growth and decline of Amsterdam, Unique clock, Pretty board, Relatively smooth combination of different mechanisms (area majority, auctions and card selection) into a single game, I added some visual and tactual lustre to the game by substituting the MoA warehouse paper chits with the small houses from Colovini's Doge boardgame.

What I didn't like: Small card size made for tedious shuffling, Cardboard chits difficult to handle and got lost (visibly) on the board, Way too much counting out of paper money which was also difficult to separate, No optimal place to position the clock, Not sure of who is winning or of any ideal strategies. 

I still plan to keep it in my collection though for its uniqueness to my collection of games.

Played once and finished second after winning only two or three auctions. I liked the tension the Dutch auction added to the game, and valuating auction lots was extremely difficult (combined with the tension of the Dutch auction, this led players to overbid heavily). My only quibble is with the production quality; too many icons and colours in the game are similar and easily confused.

Edit: Purchased the game and the auction clock was broken (it stops at 190 and about 120 until you turn it upside down). Knocked the rating down to account for the truly shoddy components.

1 play. The auction timer is a bit over-rated and comes off as a bit of a gimmick. The rest of the game is a reasonable mix of multiple things in multiple areas that, to some extent, play off of each other. It did seem like a lot of cards to churn through although it progressed at a good pace once we all understood what was going on.

RATING: 7
Fast and furious with auctions that you have to win to earn the OPPORTUNITY to make money but that may cost too much in the winning. Timing to try to be in position to score is made difficult by not knowing when the scoring is going to occur. Maybe just a little too random for my tastes but worth playing on occasion.

The most gimmicky entry in Knizia's multiple-paths-to-victory trilogy, but possibly the most fun. It is not as punishing as Taj Mahal, and is not as dry as Stephenson's Rocket. The auction clock can be finicky, but it is one heck of a good little gimmick for the game and ties in nicely with the theme of the game, too. This is almost as thematic an entry as Traumfabrik.

This is a very fun game, however I find it difficult to know if you're winning or even close.  I think if you can come up with about $700k then you could be close.  There is a deck of cards that grant a player the ability to place or move their tokens.  Three cards will be drawn one card at a time.  The card can either be taken by the player, put up for bid or discarded.  Once an action is taken only the other two actions are available and the same for the third card when there is only one choice left.  When placing warehouses you get a $40k bonus for connecting bridges in the warehouse sections. Having one warehouse in each of the four sections get $100k bonus and having one product in each of the four world quadrants get $100k bonus.  Remember to have extras for the end game when you must eliminate your pieces and if you no longer fulfill requirements you must pay back the bonus $.  Remember to use the bonus money whe

One of Knizia's weaker auction games, but still fun. I like the three region scoring (global trading, Amsterdam and commodities) but there's just a few too many random scoring rounds for my liking. And the auction clock causes a few too many problems, even though it brings a nice level of tension to the game. Perhaps a once a year outing.

RATING: 7
A solidly designed game, with lots of options and some agonizing decisions. More thematic than usual for Knizia, with the game's progress tied in with the actual history of Amsterdam over a period of a hundred years or so. The "Dutch auction" mechanism makes a change from run-of-the-mill auction games. And also unusual for Knizia, your score at the end of the game is simply the amount of money you made!

RATING: 7
I really like the way the different mechanisms fit together in this game.  It made sense and things flowed together.  While it did seem that some players overpaid for cards, but that doesn't detract from the game for me.  Those players paid a penalty for this - they had less money at the game's end (the winning condition).  I think bids will get lower with more experience, which I hope to be able to "experience" soon.  Fun game - based on one play with five players.

A middleweight Knizia where you really have to balance your play so that you make a showing in the scoring rounds.

3-5 player area-majority and auction game. It plays really similarly to El Capitan/Tycoon, and is more complex, but it just loses out, because of the randomness involved, and because it's kinda hard to know how much to bid. The game features a Dutch auction, which is awesome, but does seem to cause people to overpay for things. Feels like Monopoly, Euro-style.

Ok, so it's got the noisy buzzing auction clock. Jumpy players tend to pay too much for everything! Heh. But that aside, the game feel typically Kniza: spread yourself around evenly and capitalize on other players' mistakes/greed.

Pretty much built around that Dutch Auction machine which is a neat component but that sound can be pretty irritating. Game is otherwise pretty typical Knizia/Shark/Acquire. Almost constant scoring rounds can be a bit jarring but I won the first time by buying one card the entire time and hoarding money (so I could force doubles constantly). Okay, but a bit tedious as it doesn't change much as the game progresses.

How cool is the loud obnoxious gadget?  Anyway, I feel that this is one of the few Knizia games where the theme really works.  I feel it is a successful attempt to be evocative of the history of Amsterdam.  

There are lots of fun little decisions, with elements of stock and city building.  Great production with nicely drawn artwork and of course commodities in German games always get funky names (Bags, Scales, Towels, and Party Favors).

Perhaps you need to buy into one of each type in order to win?  This makes the strategy of bidding for nothing irrelevant. If I can figure out what would be required as a minimum level of ownership to win I think that this would rise to an 8.

UPDATE:  After not playing this for years it finally hit the table again.  It hasn't worn well.  There is such an extreme amount of luck in what cards you can draw for yourself. Then, trying to contend with the luck the hourglass cards and how those cause scoring, makes for fluky results.

Often times auctions won't be interesting to your strategy, and when those that you are interested in come up people can get twitchy and overpay, leaving the both of you farther behind.

It was cool at the time, but now, stale and dated.

I think this game is sorely underrated.  I love the auction mechanic in this one - a timer goes around and the first person to hit it wins the auction.  There's some area control also involved and lots of unpredictability as the time cards can really make you go through a bunch of years in a hurry.  Overall, this game has a bunch of depth to it.

UPDATE: The luck of the cards you get has a bit of an overly strong influence on the game, and I find myself not wanting to play this quite as much as others.  Downgrading to an 8.

An interesting game! An older Knizia title but still a great game with nice mechanics: the obvious one is of course the Dutch auction which reduces AP/playing time a lot compared to a normal English auction; a neat area majority mini-game in Amsterdam. The graphics look a bit dated, the game is still well worth to be played because of the mechanics though.

The auction clock works well, don't hit it too hard. To prevent it from breaking better say "Stop!" and then calmly stop the clock to avoid it to break.

I love the fast-paced auctions and the tension generated by the timer.  In fact, as much as I enjoy auction games (and I think I like them all), the one potential drawback can be one or two players slowing down the game, a problem that the timer corrects.  I also like how it's difficult to calculate how much to bid for each item because there are so many different factors to consider, such as where you and your opponents are on the commodity scale, what bonuses you're after, your current money on hand, etc.  The one thing it's not difficult to figure out is who designed this game!  Update:  played with five and, though still fun, I almost think there's too much going on.  Often that's a good thing, but here I think the design could be a little tighter, such as Knizia's superb auction trilogy with Medici, Ra, and Taj Mahal.  It doesn't get any better than that.

Don't let the naysayers dissuade you, this is a good solid game.  In a world now dominated by the mechanic mash up, this one is pure and simple with a gimmick, of a countdown auction clock, which is both thematic and exciting.  With good gamers with a solid understanding of relative valuation, it is very tense with tough decisions which cannot be hampered by analysis paralysis by the very nature of the falling cost clock.

All these complaints and comments about winning by not bidding are spurious and only evidence a very poor ability of the group to understand basic and fundamental gaming principals.  If you play with reasonably capable people you WILL NOT win that way, you'll come in last place...bully for you.  

There is some luck in what you draw on our turn, but because you must choose placement sequentially, even that's no guarantee you'll choose correctly on placement.  Plus for the first 3/4 of the game, placements are so open that it won't somehow lock your win, or even put you in the lead. The balance is far too clever and tight for such manipulations--this is from the tightly-balanced-Kinizia heyday after all.

And it is typically found at bargain prices because people sheep along and think the game is broken.  A super value for anyone who has a good and skilled gaming group, and a spot on the shelf for one more game.  It fills a spotnot occupied by any other similar games....there are no other similar games.

This seems like just any other auction/set collection game, but the Knizian wrinkles make it memorable.

The fact that you score for linked areas is okay, but really gets interesting once you have to start removing markers towards the end of the game. The scoring of bonuses for crossing bridges and being all shipping tracks is fine, but the loss of these bonuses (and having to repay them) adds difficult decisions.

The Dutch auction is nicely novel too, even though ours snapped on its first use.

Being Dutch, we were intrigued by this game, especially the Dutch Auction.  The timer counts down from a high price and whoever stops it first, pays the price shown.  We hit the table instead of the timer as people can get excited during bidding.  Following the history of Holland is neat as you acquire wealth and then lose it as Holland's trade routes fall apart near the end of the game.

Playing this for the first time 11 years after its debut, I expected Merchants of Amsterdam to feel a little dated. But I guess that's the magic of Knizia - Merchants holds up well compared with more recent designs and still occupies a fairly unique niche. The dutch auction clock is kinda cool, at first, but I think the novelty would wear off quickly. And as much as I like bidding games, auctions where you have to pick a value out of the air (in merchants, for example, biddng starts at $200,000 and drops from there. but early on it's very difficult to judge whether the right bid is $80 or $180 ...) appeal less to me these days than they once did (I now like Strozzi better than Medici because the bidding is more straightforward and streamlined). In the final analysis, I think I'd gladly play Merchants again if someone suggests it, but I didn't enjoy it enough to keep a copy on my game shelf.

Could this be Knizia's best themed game?  Merchants of Amsterdam is framed by historic events that march toward the game's end.  I expected the noisy auction clock to interfere with gameplay, but instead it generates real excitement.  There's a metagame of watching other players for the slightest quiver--at what would have been the game's most intellectual moments.  For a moment, one becomes a child playing Perfection again, and that's a huge compliment.

I like it. Lots going on but I wish you could do more to influence your score, your moves to improve your position feel like baby steps. Overall good feedback from our group. Cool clock.

This one seems to have flown under the rader. Knizia makes so many games. I guess some are bound get lost in the tidal wave of games he continuously publishes. Too bad, because this is a fun, somewhat thematic auction game worthy of mention. The auction clock has held up fine thus far...

This is a game that I had seen a while ago and picked up because it looked really interesting. But as it turns out a couple other people in my groups also own it... despite which all of our copies sat unplayed for a few years. I finally got to try this one out.

The game is an auction game with a slight twist. Every turn the "mayor", which rotates, draws three cards. He must decide to auction one, use one and discard one... but dealing with each before seeing the next. Then the auction begins.

The auction mechanic in this game is one I've never seen elsewhere. There's a gizmo timer thing with prices around the edge. You start the gizmo and the needles turns, slowly dropping the price until someone slaps the timer and wins the auction. That made for some interesting decisions where you had to figure out not how high you will bid, but how low you think you can let the bid go.

The cards help you compete in the three areas of the game, having goods, houses and colonies. There are four categories of each of those, and the ones that most people compete in will pay out the most, but only for the first and second players. Periodically throughout the game, you'll draw a time card which advances the end of the game and often triggers a scoring round for one of the three areas (which can be seen ahead of time). When the track gets to the end, you have a final scoring in all the categories and most money wins.

I started the game reluctant to bid too much on auctions, with the idea that I could save money and be more competitive in later auctions. That was a really bad plan. As it turns out, the scoring rounds happen very frequently. Which means that the people who spent a lot of money on getting an advantage in the different areas will get a payout... so there's not a huge upside to saving your money, as you won't really preserve a cash advantage. I ended up being behind in the important categories trying to play catch up (trying to play catch up poorly to boot!).

It was interesting that we quickly began bidding the maximum or near to it on a regular basis. There's a special feature of the timer that if you hit it at the very beginning of the start, and before it gets to the first bid amount, it triggers a restart... where you double the value of all the bids. Given how often we were bidding near the max bid, I suspect we should have used that doubling more often.

I had a lot of fun with this one, despite not getting how to play it well. I'd really like to try it again with a new perspective and see if I can have a better handle on how to play this game.

Wanted to love this.  Good thematic atmosphere, auction clock is fun....but I think the game is broken becuase there is a perverse rationality to overbid.  Someone could probably write a PHD math thesis on this perverse rationality.

I was quite looking forward seeing the dutch auction in a game, but this left me sorely disappointed. The dutch auction here is glommed on and isn't connected to the theme or mechanics (except, hey, it's a dutch auction and it takes place in Amsterdam, which is also dutch. Brilliant.) And in fact, the two work against each other to create overbidding. First, because the dutch auction naturally promotes overbidding by psychology, and two, because of the way the turns work, if you don't win any auctions you are a basically sitting on your hands for most of the game. The board play is all right, but by now there are literally a bajillion euros that offer the exact same sort of play, many of them with other far more interesting qualities.

Decent area area control divided into 3 sections.  I think the game would be better with blind bidding and the highest bidder paying 10K more than the next highest bid as opposed to hands flying to swat the price setting contraption. Not one of Knizia's best, but still worth some table time.

Won on autopilot, ignoring all but 3(?) auctions, and not really having much fun.  Arguably that strategy should have forced the the other players to lower their bids until I started to join the auctions, but still ... I can see the qualities of the game, but I think the design is flawed in allowing winning to not be fun.

The time for this game has passed, and it is justly forgotten among oh-so-many similar area majority exercises.  The dutch auction and ticking timer should inject some tension, but the cards that are auctioned are so vanilla that it is a) very difficult to value things correctly, and b) very similar to another card that will be certain to come along very quickly.  There's a lot of math behind the design of this game, and it feels very dry and staid as a result.  The done-a-thousand-times theme certainly doesn't help.  It's worth playing once as a study of its era, but it's not worth keeping for anybody but the most diehard Knizia collectors.

1play, 4 players. This was a crazy game and one player kept 
"psyching" me out over the timer thing which meant that I paid 200k for 3 auctions. A fun game though I am not sure about its lasting power. There are better Knizia games for me.

The dutch auction is an interesting mechanic that I'd like to explore over the course of a few plays (in our first game everone overpaid which led to the most passive player winning by default it seemed). However it's possible that once players get a sense of the game bids will become predictably boring. The jury is still out on this one

I don't know if it was the Dutch auction mechanism, the personalities playing the game, or the mechanisms of the game that made me dislike this so much, but I didn't enjoy this game.  It's difficult to catch up with other players once you fall behind, and if a player "sets" the average sale of an item at a high enough price, then another player can win the game without ever having to win a bid.  Strange.

A decent game, but not as good as other Knizia (and non-Knizia) auction games.  The dutch auction mechanic should be good, but the values always seem to hover in the exact same range. Some card imbalances can produce lucky swings, and I don't think there are quite enough turns for the effects of this to balance out. So...not bad, but just slightly off.

Neat dutch auction "count-down" mechanic - clock counts down,  first person to lose nerve and touch the dial pays the amount currently showing.  Board symbology gets lost in the artwork,  and card symbology is not consistent.  Still,  a fun little bidding game.  Played an edition with circular cardboard counters,  which would be way more awesome if they were wooden discs.  Good quality paper money though.

it would be a very good game with a fun auction mechanism. we all head to unpleasant impressions:
 - cards with the ship and triple resource are way too strong and always kept by the player
 - getting a sandclock in your turn when it leads to a scroing BEFORE u have any chance to do anything is way too bad.
One of us got too unlucky and had no chance at winning. this is a pity and we hope we just got some rules wrong

The historical background in the rules, and the progression through the
events of Amsterdam adds a nice feel to the game. The auction clock makes
a grating, vibrating noise, but if you are playing with a noisy group, it
just adds to the action. It can be quite difficult to tell who's winning, leading
to a suspenseful final count of florins at the end of the game. And yes, you
can win the game without winning any auctions if you are playing with
over-eager bidders.

The 5th player seems to be added in as a draw for more players. This is strictly a 4-player game.  The game is not well-balanced, as money is semi-scarce in the beginning, but rolls in later on.  Not a whole lot of strategy here.

The dutch auction mechanic doesn't work as it just forces all players to be poised to strike the button as soon as they see an opponent make a move for it.  I can win every game simply by having faster reflexes than my opponents.

Area majority in three different things (world, items, city) at the same time. The reverse auction device. The turn track showing what is coming up. All things add together to make a fun game. You have to plan for the future and play for the present. Learning to gauge what others think things are worth is a challenge.

I really enjoyed my first playing of this game, and can't wait to play it again.  In thinking about the actual decisions though, it doesn't seem to measure up to the other great games.  Early on, the best strategy seems to pass on anything that isn't a ship card.  And if the players involved are bidding too much, you might as well take a nap for the auctions, which means you won't have to worry about any kind of money crunch, removing another element from the game entirely.  Having said all that, there's just something really fun about the game and I would recommend it highly if you can overly the faults I mentioned.

Clever decisions and interesting bid with the clock, but turn order heavily favors those going first. Luck of the draw can also have a significant impact with the timing of the event cards which move the turn marker along the event track. Taking out a loan is crucial, as the game seems to favor the rich getting richer -- they have the money to bid higher on items, gaining and advantage in the actions purchased, which leads to more money to spend on subsequent auctions, etc. Players with little money early in the game (missing a key auction or failing to take a loan) can soon find themselves bid out of the game by never having the option to bid on anything, as their maximum bid ceiling is far, far below what anyone else can (and will) bid to keep them bottled up.

Interesting auction mechanic. Many ways to score, perhaps a few too many, which makes the game a bit clunky at times. 

It&#039;s important not to bid too high, otherwise non-bidders can runaway with the game. Most cards are probably worth something in the 120-150 range.

The theme is integrated very nicely with the mechanics and really gives you a feel of seeing the Dutch trading empire rising and then declining.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The clock and the dutch auction style really does makes it worthwhile to play the game at least once.  However, the problem with this is that even if just one person tends to jump the gun early and overpay, it tends to make everyone else do the same in order for them to be able to buy something, until people run out of money or finally figure out the real worth of the card in question (which ever happens first).

The intertwining mechanics between the area majority of Amersterdam/the world and the goods track is fascinating.  The decision between wanting sole control of a district/continent and the need to keep it in first place so it will score the most is a difficult one and a fine line to walk.  Do you play it safe by investing heavily into the same place and thus keeping the majority but depriving yourself in other areas?  Or do you spread yourself out more evenly with the possibility of scoring more and maybe none at all as well?  Unfortunately, these aspects point to an imbalance among the 3 major types of cards in the deck, mainly the ship that moves just the goods track, while the other two allow you to place a token on the board and to advance in one of the commodities.  Something else I didn't care for was how often the hourglass/time cards show up.  There were instances when as many as 5 of them were drawn on a single person's turn.  So while it is possible to plan for the events ahead, it varied wildly when and how quickly they would take place.  They should have just shortened the track to avoided this randomness from affecting the game so much.

By all accounts I shoud like Merchants of Amsterdam, but I don't.

Struggling for position on three different, but often paired fronts can prove quite a challenge.  While being top banana is very rewarding, a strong second-place presence can really pay off.  Additionally, rather large sums of money can be amassed through revocable bonuses, allowing everyone a chance at the cash.

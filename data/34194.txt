RATING: 7
Light set-collection and tile-laying game with a nice, fluffy theme.

This is the most advanced of the "retto" series (not that that's saying very much), and like the others, you have the typical options of: 1)drawing and adding a tile to a truck, 2)taking a truck of tile(s) and ending your turn, and 3)performing a money action.

This time around, there are actually some more meaningful decisions as you have to carefully place any acquired tiles within a confined area, and no 2 types of animals can be adjacent and only 3 types can be placed at all (unless you expand).  Also, you want to consider your options in the event that you acquire workers.

The money actions are: 1)expand your zoo, either a small one or a large one (which allows for another animal type to be played), 2)move a worker (more on that later), and 3)purchase a tile either from your depot or someone else's. 

Your goal of course is to get the most points, and this is primarily accomplished by acquiring a large amount of tiles (1 point awarded per tile in your zoo).  Of course, any tiles you cannot play get stuck in your depot and it's minus 2 points per different animal type in your depot.  The additional layer of scoring comes from the workers, which are awarded at every 5 and 10 of the same animal type.  Workers give additional scoring through several different ways: 1)there is a cashier, which gives 1 point per coin at the end of the game, making money hoarding a viable strategy, unlike Zooloretto (also it should be noted that a coin is awared at every 3, 6, 9, and 12 animals of the same type), 2)there are trainers which give 1 point per EVERY tile they are adjacent to providing it is one 1 3 specific types of animals (therefore you have to plan how to lay out your tiles in order to be able to place the trainer), 3)there is a worker who gives 1 point per fish tile (many of the animals come with a fish symbol), 4)a worker who reduces the negative points of your depot by half.

This game is advertised as an expansion and/or standalone.  I find it is far superior to Zooloretto, but I would be interested in combining the two games together to see how it plays out.  If you're going to get only 1 of these games, I recommend Aquaretto, as it's very accessible, has a fun light theme, and actually has a bit of decision making to it, while retaining the light gameplay of its predecessors.

Own the [boardgame=40533]Three Coworkers[/boardgame] mini-expansion as well as the [boardgame=40264]Trains[/boardgame] mini-expansions.

A Zooloretto variant. I love Schacht, but decisions in push-your-luck games should be agonizing. The push-you-luck of Coloretto is bland and uninteresting. Porting it to a board game doesn't help.

An enjoyable, fast game that I enjoy more than Zooloretto. I like the added spatial element of places the tiles, and the options one can pursue using the co-workers. I do not see the point in playing it together with Zooloretto... it would just be too long without adding much enjoyment. But if you enjoy Zoloretto, get this one. It takes it up a notch, which is a good thing in my book.

[With Training Camp, Trains, Three Coworker Tiles expansions]

She thinks it's cute (ok, so do I).  We both think it's a really quick game for two with just enough depth to be fun, and not enough to be frustrating.  A little "auction" and a little tile placement and plenty of fun, though it may get old fast -- and once you know what you're doing, there's a lot of sheer luck of the tile draw.

UPDATE:  a few more plays, it still seems good, and wise truck manipulation and tile placement still seems as important as luck.

It's basically Zooloretto with much more thought required. Is it worth getting? Yes, under one or two conditions:
1) You loved Zooloretto; and/or
2) You want a considerably more challenging version of Zooloretto.
I certainly enjoy Aquaretto, but I can easily imagine myself playing it just as much as Zooloretto. And, one final note: Aquaretto's two player version is MUCH better than two-player Zooloretto.

A great family board game which offers plenty of meat to satisfy gamers.  The rules are easy enough for anyone to pick up and hidden in them are subtle layers of strategy.  I haven't played the original Zooloretto, but from what I have experienced with this is that the animal acquirement and then placement certainly gives players a bit to think about (the bonuses given for set completions add even more to think about).  Usually plays around 45 minutes with the artwork and components working to attract in non-gamers.

I'd suggest to get this after traditional gateway games as the spatial aspect of animal placement may be a bit tricky to those who are new to the hobby.

I really like Coloretto, and this is a very interesting variation on the mechanic.  It takes the idea of the card game and turns it into a more tangible concept.  I enjoyed my one play, and I expect I'll enjoy future plays.  I need to play Zooloretto for comparison's sake.

This is a slightly re-imagined Zooloretto that tweaks the basics just a tad.  Otherwise, its a nice variation on the base game.  Not sure it its an expansion or a stand-alone.  I tend to think of it more as a pure expansion, but it is completely playable out of the box - so it gets a rating.  I like the dynamic nature of the enclosures - but the graphics bug me a bit.  I have a hard time getting into the theme of aquatic animals while placing them on green grass spots.  Odd reason to nick a game a point in rating, but I had to do it.

- Vendor stands replaced with workers; not all workers created equal.

I enjoyed this game more than Zooloretto and I had it at an 8. So, this is an 8 for now until I get more plays in. This version seems less fiddly and no exchanging made this seem more streamlined. Build the enclosure and keep it there. Who moves animals around that often in zoos anyway?

RATING: 8
In this game the designer takes the system that he popularized in Coloretto and Zooloretto and throws a completely different twist on it.  The game turn is still very basic and so it remains fairly easy to teach to non-gamers.  But now they've added in a tile-placement aspect.  Players are challenged to not only collect a good group of animals, but also to organize their aquariums in a sensible fashion.

The other added piece to the game are the coworkers that offer bonus points at the end of the game.  Many will argue that the keeper position is overpowered in this regard but, since every player can use that area, everyone can benefit equally.  The way that money is gained and the added expansions for your aquarium make this game feel completely new and different from its predecessors, and I tend to like the added elements in this game better.  There is also a combo game played with both Zooloretto and Aquaretto which I am anxious to try at some point.

It plays like the other 'retto games but I found this one better than the Zoo version. What I liked better was your creation of the basins.  It added something to the game that appealed to me.  Had to remember to take money and workers but really, I enjoyed this.  (two player).  Rating could go up.

I rate this higher than Zooloretto - which I really enjoyed.  Although it is only slightly more complex, the added complexities make for a game that involves far more thought and planning.  An excellent follow up and quite different to the base Zooloretto.  Altogether excellent.

A more "gamer" version of Zooloretto.  Animal tiles have to be arranged onto the boards (instead of the fixed pens of Zooloretto) which adds more flexibility in how many animals you can acquire but in the end really doesn't add much to the game.  The money actions are streamlined and more restrictive.  Too similar to Zooloretto to bother owning both (I can't imagine combining the two).  I'm choosing Zooloretto because it is simpler and plays quicker.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Probably one bridge too far in terms of adding complexity to Coloretto. The basic mechanic of adding to lots or choosing one is still a good one, but the different animals just don't seem that well balanced - the "feedable" ones are just clearly better. I never felt like my decisions actually had much impact on whether I won.

RATING: 7
I wasn't a fan of Zooloretto, so I didn't hold many high hopes for this one.  However, Aquaretto far exceeded my expectations and held much closer to the things I like about Coloretto, while getting rid of the stuff I didn't like about Zooloretto.  Overall, Aquaretto maintained more simplicity while adding some new twists to the basic Coloretto system to make it more interesting and fun.

Placing your animals is more strategic than Zooloretto, bacuse of your modular zoo board and makes it refreshing if you've played Zooloretto. Isnt different enough to keep both of them in your collection imo.

This game is so good.  I had heard say that Zooloretto is a good game but Aquaretto was miles better and I didn;t believe it.  Heather wanted it (as she really likes Zooloretto) and now we have played it I am grateful she did.  So much fun.  marked much higher than Zooloretto.  It doesn;t need the expansions (which is different from Zooloretto, as it really needs the expansions, in my opinion) but I am looking forward to adding a little more to it and seeing if it improves an already wonderful game any.

I seem to actually get this game and thoroughly enjoy it.  Money is needed and so rare (so might try the Savings book and see if that helps the game).  Also the burying of animals in your pool really can affect decisions made by other players.  Great mechanic.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
If this had been released after Coloretto then, Zooloretto would never have been published.

All the good play of Zooloretto with the added decisions of a tile laying game and without the complicated scoring of Zooloretto.  This is a good combination of player interaction, through the tile collecting mechanism, and solitary optimization, through the development of your aquarium through the tile laying mechnism.   High quality components compliment the high quality game play.  A solid choice and good fun for families and light gamers.

Okay, it's better than Zooloretto, but I didn't care for it at all. Too few options for making a strategy and even to make some tactical moves, and I feel that it is a light game which tries too hard to be something heavier than what it can actually handle... So I think it fails in that regard. Also, I find there are too few actions in the game and not enough stuff to think about. Probably won't play it again unless I'm with kids.

scored 32.

Taking the trucks seems a very interactive process. There's an element of 'push your luck' but with other players determining when your luck 'runs out', the game will play differently as other folks' tactics evolve or if playing with different folk.

Deciding how to load the truck contains a fair bit of strategy - you need to consider what other people want and try to keep it unnappealing to others whilst potentially great for yourself.

The luck of the tile-drawing also keeps it light, simple and adds variance.

The purchasing/placement adds some satisfaction - I love fiting my tiles around and having upgrades is always satisfying. One great thing here is that the upgrades - extra land and extra potential species - feel so natural and 'obvious', not requiring any extra rules.

The worker placement also adds a little tactical element - needing to calculate what will give the most points - but I doubt that will ever be  a major decision. having said that, it's fun having a combination of simple and harder decisions - the easier decisions give you confidence for the harder ones.

I'd be interested to see how many genuinely potential strategies there are and how much is just governed by luck.

What I Liked:
* More flexability in building park & more meaningful decisions than Zooloretto or Coloretto
* Easy to teach and play

What I Didn't Like:
* Theme... pfft, I have never been one for "seaparks".
* Could be a bit more difficult than Zooloretto for Children competing against adults.

Overall
Ok game, but for the price there is a lot better out there!

RATING: 7
Better than Zooloretto but still inferior to Coloretto because of the many ways to deal with undesirable tiles --- the issue I had with Zooloretto as well. Adding other types of decisions to the game does not make up for diluting the importance of the core decision of whether to load up a truck or to grab it before an unwanted tile gets loaded. On the plus side, the use of money is less confusing in Aquaretto than in Zooloretto.

Cool game about making water zoos. I find this game better with less people, since you can control the trucks more so to prevent being screwed, although we have had those molments where one person was taken out of the game by another making the move to hurt them. We laughed so hard the game had to stop for 5+ min, thats what happens when you play with backstabbers though.

RATING: 8
Great game, much better than Zooloretto in my opinion. You have to plan aheadmuch more here which can be hard for the kids, so if you're looking for a child friendly game go for Zooloretto. On the other hand, if you're looking for a clever Euro game that fun for adults too get this.

The fish strategy seems a bit too powerful but will have to play more to see if that's really true.

RATING: 7
A sister (or expansion) game to Zooloretto.  Essentially the same game in terms of mechanics.  Load up the trucks with aquatic animals and fit them into your aquariums.  The differences kick in - there are no fixed enclosures in this game, so you can grow your exhibits in any way you care to place your tiles.  Workers now appear, that have four potential functions, all helping in the points scoring at the end of the game.  The money action to exchange animals has been removed, giving game play a cleaner feel.  While very similar to Zooloretto (heck, they can be bolted together for a combined game), this felt a little more interesting with the open ended placement and worker considerations.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Has much more strategy than one might suspect at first and the Wife Approved animal tiles are really cute!  :laugh:.  

Gets bonus points for being both an expansion and a stand-alone game - but loses points for not being solitaire friendly.

Base game Aquaretto is far superior to base game Zooloretto, but both shine with expansions.

The 2 player rules that come in the box are garbage.  They are recycled from Zooloretto and they just don't work in this game.  Luckily it's an easy fix.

A slightly more gamer's version of Zooloretto.  Still relatively light, but kids can still grasp the rules.  

Instead of set pens for each type of creature, your "basins" can be as large as you wish, as long as they don't butt up against another type of "basin".  Workers that can be employed in 4 different ways allow for different ways to increase points.  Money is a lot easier to come by in this game than its predecessor.

I think this is a better gateway game than Ticket to Ride or Settlers. It just plays so smooth and quick and provides a few options for points scoring. You can go a little bit deeper, but not by very much. It's alright though, cause it's supposed to be gateway and I'm rating it as such.

I actually like this game less than zooloretto.  An odd complaint: Set up is a bit too fiddly for the fun to follow.  The coworkers are interesting but don't feel integrated into the game play.   Perhaps the lightning bolt animals (can't be trained) and the fish symbol animals (can score points if fed) add more chrome than worth the trouble.

I like the new spatial decisions that must be made, and I like the increased menu of money actions.  However, I'm concerned that going for lots of fish symbols seems to be awfully hard to beat.  Also, I don't think it's wise to allow players to play five different types of animals when their parks are fully expanded.  With three players, that's all but one type of animal - where's the pain?  Finally, and this is important, I don't like how the game looks.  Squares of water magically float in the middle of a grassy field.  On balance, I rate Aquaretto a little lower than Zooloretto.  If you were playing exclusively with gamers, I might give Aquaretto the slight edge. But neither one of these is a game you're going to buy to play with your hardcore gaming buddies. And for a game to play with kids and mixed groups and less ardent gamers, I think you're better off with Zooloretto.

Good fun, with a different theme than most.  Some different mechanics than it's sibling Zooloretto, but still plays very similarly.

It's a more refined Zooloretto, borrowing some mechanics from both Coloretto and Zooloretto.  It still doesn't match the elegant simplicity of Coloretto, but while I didn't really have much interest in buying Zooloretto, Aquaretto is at least on the fence.

I like the push your luck element of deciding when to take one of the trucks. The game mechanics are fairly simple, but there's plenty of strategy. Using build actions to delay drawing tiles is important. Tile placement is extremely important, and that's where I usually blow it.

An excellent addition to the animal themed set collection series.. A separate game, and yet also an expansion for Zooloretto.
This time we're collecting aquatic animals such as penguins, dolphins and sea-lions.. with no set enclosures, so you have to decide on where best to place them in your zoo so they don't mix.

As a stand-alone game this has more depth to it than Zooloretto.. and it plays differently enough for me, that I'm happy to keep both. Have not yet tried a combined game, but it is on my to-do list.

Az egyik első tényleges újkori társasjáték élményünk a Zooloretto volt. Ahelyett annak vízi változatát vásároltuk meg. Hasonló alapszabályokon nyugvó rendszer kicsit más fűszerezéssel, amelynek témája az állatkerted igazgatása és a legtöbb pont megszerzése, így lepipálva a többi állatkert igazgatóját.

I liked it, but seemed over before we got started. Very few zookeeper-eeples made it out onto the boards. Maybe we were over drawing tiles to the trucks or something. Didn't seem to be enough cash going around to be able to buy animals out of the holding pens. Not sure how much replayability this game can hold. Will have to give this another try to see if any lessons have been learned.

This has so far been the biggest surprise of my Christmas games. This takes the fun of Coloretto and gives it real tactical depth. It's a tentative rating, but this seems like it could become one of my favorites without much trouble.

I like this game more than Zooloretto.  The scoring is more granular, and the meeples that you win for putting 5 animals in a group give you some choice about what strategy to take (money/fish/trained animals/penalty reduction).

But the fact that there is limited geography and that you have to decide where to play new fields makes things annoying.  I think I prefer Coloretto best, where you don't have to deal with geography or topology.

I have had one rather fun play of the mega-version with both games. I like it but would rather play each game on it's own. One thing in combining the games, the back of the tiles are confusing. Zooloretto tiles have blue backs, so I kept drawing those tiles when I wanted Aquaretto tiles. Unfortunate but not an issue if you don't play them together.

I like the changes Aquaretto brings to Zooloretto.  The tile laying has a lot more thought to it than being limited to enclosures and the capability to expand however you'd like makes each board feel more individual.  The meeples are a good addition but the feeders (points for fish) are just too powerful.  Perhaps it's because I've only played games with 2 and 3 players but I can't imagine any reason to ever take a manager, and cashiers are pretty weak too since the most coins I've seen someone end up with at the end is 3.  Trainers can be useful given the right layout but I've yet to see such a layout give more benefit than a feeder.

I really like this game because it does have more thought involved with the same familiar truck mechanism and a streamlined scoring system.  It still doesn't feel like a 10 due to the meeple off-balances and that it does have a fair share of luck and randomness, not quite enough strategy to hold up with the other 10s.  Maybe plays with 4 and 5 players would change my mind on that one.

I was also just a tad disappointed to find that it doesn't really 'expand' Zooloretto.  You can just play them side by side basically two games at once with a shared coin pool.

You very quickly start strangling your own space and have to spend money to expand.  And even trying to figure out where to expand to is a fun decision.

At the same time though, I'm not sure it would make a good family game.  There's about 4 different symbols on the tiles that mean 4 different things.  Then they need to keep track of the different things they can spend money on.  And then they have to keep track of the different ways they may use their meeples when they acquire them.  Not to mention remembering to take money on multiples of 3 and meeples on multiples of 5.  It's really quite a lot to ask a casual gamer.

However, I think it's a good filler length game for gamers though.  We finished our game in under an hour and we were 4 newbies.  The game plays quickly and does offer you plenty of interesting decisions.  Still, it is a little bit like a fish out of water.

I do NOT consider this as an expansion to Zooloretto. Aquaretto just didn't work for me. I really didn't like the presentation. It had a lot of neat concepts that I wish could be applied to Zoolo, such as the coworkers, but all in all, it just didn't work for me.

My wife wanted to buy it just for the animals and theme alone. 

30 minute light filler, very light but apparently more to account for than SDJ winner Zoorletto which apparently hardly constitutes a game, in no rush to try that one, scary....  The mechanic of removing random tiles is totally bogus, this just means that someone will randomly get better tile distribution than the others and vice versa...why?  My first adjustment would be to take that crappy mechanic right out.

A little push your luck, a little bit to think about but I actually liked Airships better than this for this kind of a weighted game.  Too much luck in the whole tile pull aspect, at least with 4 players.  I think it is better suited for 2 or 3 and would be that much shorter as well.

A seriously tight game. Takes the Coloretto mechanic and gives it some actual tough decisions, both in what you take and where you put it. The touch of resource management (coins, space) adds a bit of spice as well.

Preliminary rating.
Based off of Coloretto the game adds additional actions to give a meatier feel to the game. I do like the simplicity of Coloretto but it works best if you play several hands, which rarely happens with my group. Because of this we don't get it to the table much. Maybe Aquaretto will see more play.

Finally got a copy thanks to a very generous fellow geek. Obviously very similar to Zooloretto (and Coloretto), but different enough to have both in my collection. 

I know I am in the minority but I prefer Zooloretto and Aquaretto over Coloretto. I think they are full games while Coloretto for me just lacks that something.

We had Zooloretto for a while, and everyone seemed to really enjoy it. However, I had the chance to trade it for Yspahan - which was too good to pass up.

Aquaretto seems to have the same play, but with the added strategy of meeples which sounds interesting. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A few more levers are added to the Zooloretto core but the result still remains a game on the lighter side of Euros. For gamers, there’s not much reason to play Zooloretto anymore when they have Aquaretto. On the other hand, the upgrade isn’t mandatory as the solid central mechanism with the basic decision to take a cart or push your luck is the same in both games. For playing with the family, it’s probably more important if an aqua park or a zoo evokes more interest.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Just a touch more complicated than Zooloretto with the addition of workers. I enjoy it for being a gateway level family game with water animals, which are adorable. Feels a bit strange that you're building right into the grass, but there's actually a spatial aspect to this game in addition to the set collection that was present in its predecessor.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I was worried that this one would be too similar to Zooloretto or (once I read the rules) that it would be too hard for my 8- and 6-year-old daughters to pick up on (it's listed as 10+, whereas Zooloretto is listed 8+). I was wrong on both counts. While the game certainly is more challenging than Zooloretto (and it helped that the kids had the Zooloretto framework to build on), the game isn't dauntingly difficult, even for the kids--both of whom said they liked Aqua a lot better. It should also have just enough meat for gamers as a between-meals snack. The option for expansion placement really opens the game up (no pun intended) in terms of tactical possibilities (or ways to hose yourself).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
As a game it's arguably better than Zooloretto, but aesthetically I think Zoo definitely has the edge. On balance, I was pleasantly surprised by Zoo (which I played first), and slightly disappointed with this one, though this has grown on me since. I'd still rather have Zoo!

RATING: 8.2
A more challenging puzzle than zooloretto. Also has a part inside which was added to zooloretto with the boss expansion later on (although they differ of course but it feels similar). I prefer to use Zooloretto with Exotic and promos and this one only with promos. That being said both games have enough differences gameplay-wise.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I like the added options in Aquaretto, which make the money a little more important, as well as a bit of thought involving tile placement.  The additions make the game a little more challenging than Zooloretto, while not adding to the play time, which is a good thing, while still remaining a relatively simple game to teach new players. 

I guess if you had to pick only one, I would go with Aquaretto, though the theme makes a little less sense (especially with the same, grass-colored background for your "basins").  The changes are so minor that it becomes pretty evident that this is mainly just a post-SdJ cash-in, since similar results could have been achieved using the existing Zooloretto system with a minor expansions.

Plays a lot like Zooloretto, but with enough differences to make it worth your while.
I had looked very much forward to the variant combining Zoo/Aqua-retto, but was a bit disappointed by the actual experience. There´s not that much overlap between the two. It feels more like playing two different games side by side, at the same time, than one combined game. basically, the only overlap is that all the money you earn, from either game, can be used for either game.

Mini expansions can be difficult to rate individually, but I like them, so give them a collective 8.

Rating may go up with more plays.

The Good: Fun family tile game with some strategy involved. As a stand-alone game, this game is VERY similar Zooloretto, but with a few improved rules. It can also play as an expansion to the Zoo, but have not yet tried this.

The Bad: It seems like it would be more fun with more money and workers, but these are both very scarce. Make sure you caution new players not to accept too many different types of animals or they will lose badly and may not play again.

Great game, but the "fishmongers" strategy seems too strong. Neutering it (like making the payout half) would probably make your worker-placing decisions more interesting. And one player would still be able to pursue that strategy and rack up a lot of points, since not everyone at the table would be obsessed with snapping up fish like they are now.

Combining the cardgame-like rules of Zooloretto with the placement rules of Blokus? Seems to be a great idea, the game seems to be (even) better than Zooloretto. 

Update: and yes, it works better than Zooloretto: the decisions are (slightly) harder, the game is simply better as at last it doesn't feel like just a card game with tiles as it uses the spatial aspectis of the board as well.

Благодаря тому, что границы бассейнов не определены так жёстко, как границы вольеров в Зоолоретто, игрокам приходится не просто размещать животных в локациях, но и выбирать для них конкретные места на поле. Игра становится немного сложнее, но, вместе с тем, и интереснее.

Plays pretty much like its predecessor with only a few slight additions and changes. Money seems a lot more plentiful though exhibit space feels like it has declined.

Slightly more complex and quite a bit less forgiving that Zooloretto -- not an "easy" game. Zooloretto is more purely focused on animal collection/screwing your friends, while Aquaretto adds other moving parts and considerations. The depot is much more brutal than the barn.

I was surprised that several folks in my group -- all of whom enjoyed Zooloretto -- were turned off by our first game of Aquaretto. I'd heard that in general if you like Zooloretto, you'll love Aquaretto; that hasn't been true so far.

After a couple of years with no plays and no strong desire to play, I sold it.

RATING: 6.5
I think Coloretto was perfect already, Zooloretto&al. haven't really added that many good things to it. But Aquaretto is pretty nice attempt to make it deeper. I think it's better than Zooloretto which is bit too close to Coloretto and doesn't add enough depth for its extra length and complexity. Aquaretto adds about enough. Small downside of Aquaretto is that most people probably prefer land animals to sea animals. Most of the time I still prefer Coloretto, but Aquaretto is nice gateway game, especially for people who find Coloretto too abstract.

* Aquaretto is best 2p game in series, but it's still more fun with 3+.

My first of the 'retto series. Played it once and it seemed to have decent play style and plenty of fun stuff. Bought it on just over a whim. Ouch! Unfortunately, in my wife's first game she made some critical error on her FIRST TURN, and the rest of the game had no good luck what-so-ever recovering her board. In the end she could count her score on one hand (oof). I am hoping she will see past this and agree to play it again. I find this game intriguing.

What can I say? This gets the nod at the game table time and time again because this game has a quality that few games out there has... this game is a girl magnet! This has been my wife's number one pick since we got this game. I find that it offers that depth that guys in my group like while the girls in the group comment on how they want a baby seal! Does this game get a point cushion because it's my wives favorite? Probably. But if you want a game that the ladies in your group will love you for getting out. Get Aquaretto.

Aquaretto is the big brother of Zooloretoo and as such it ups the complexity and need to plan ahead quite a bit. The player's water parks are tighter to manage than the pens in Zooloretto and end of game scoring bonuses are also introduced which tie in with other game mechanics.

As such I see Aquaretto as the more echallenging gamer's game of the two but I think both have their place.

The two games can also be combined for a mega game that will leave player's a little drained as they are constantly needing to weigh up the ramifications of each turn. Good fun.

海洋公園的主題，看到這主題應該一堆大人小孩的童真都被喚醒，遊戲主題感很夠，讓人真的有經營海洋公園的感覺。

美術:0.7
跟動物園相比，少了個人圖板，而是用拼圖方式來完成公園，感覺有點弱，遊戲圖板較無整體性，其他動物的美術等同動物園。

設置容易，不用花很多時間就可以開始玩，但要依人數調整袋中動物數量，有點小麻煩。

路線:0.6 
因為著重在於如何利用空間來擺放最多的動物，空間規劃感很可以著墨，但基本上還是著重在於抽到動物的隨機反應，長程策略規劃就少。

講評:
小孩大人都愛的遊戲，這類型遊戲著重抽到動物後如何擺放的隨機反應，所以遊戲重點在於卡人(載動物車的卡車)的互動，策略不深，適合全家大小同樂。有經營性，可以互相卡人搶車，算是很有互動性!

An expansion and stand alone game to Zooloretto. Players own a water zoo, collecting sets of animals.  Animal sets that expand earn money and more workers, which can be used to earn more victory points. Animals that do not fit in count against you. You also have the ability to expand your zoo, and purchase animals from other people's "discard" pile. 

I have played the standalone game, but have not attempted the combined game with Zooloretto. It's a fun, fast paced game, with a good dose of luck. With more players, the less control you have over the animals you can put into your zoo.

RATING: 8
Naturally feels very similar to Zooloretto. In Aquaretto you have greater control over how to place your animals. You need to be a bit more careful how to place your animals as you can place them in such way you're blocking your future possibilities. 

I like the way you'll gain coins by having 3rd, 6th, etc. animal of the same kind. That gives a natural way to get coins in the game to be used in manipulating your "leftover" animals. I also like the idea of the worker meeples that give you extra scoring possibilities. In graphical design it would've been good idea to mark "trainable" animals in some way because that was only thing I kept forgetting. Yes, they are logical but it is still an oversight. 

Overall the differences seem to make it a slightly better game than Zooloretto but also at the same adds a few more rules to make game more complex. A very good and pleasent game that can be played under an hour.

A pleasing and slightly more advanced riff on Zooloretto with a couple of alternative routes to scoring (a la Keltis) and a spacial aspect which is challenging without completely dominating the gameplay. Playing Jumbo Aqua/Zooloretto is so over-the-top it's crazy, but it's also surprisingly involving at that point!

After only a few plays I like Aquaretto better than Zooloretto (8.5 vs. 8).  There are a few more possibilities in Aquaretto with the undefined pens.  This may cause some AP with those prone to it but it forces every player to expand their zoo early in the game to create more animal pens (since have only 3 to start).  But is also allows for you expand whichever animal you want instead of having to swamp animals to/from your barn to get them into different pens.  I like the workers over the vendor tiles in Z but I think the fish worker is overpowered.

[b]Aquaretto[/b] was a TotalCon 2017 auction purchase.

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (4):[/COLOR]

[i]I've now played all of the Coloretto/Zooloretto games and unfortunately, despite my high hopes, Aquaretto is my least favorite. For a frame of reference I order them as follows: Coloretto [i](by a large margin)[/i], Zooloretto Junior, Zooloretto: The Dice Game, Zooloretto and Aquaretto. 

Aquaretto plays very similar to Zooloretto except you don't have predefined areas that your animals go. Instead animals can be placed anywhere, although in practice there are still very limiting rules that govern placement. The biggest being that different animals can't touch each other and your initial board only holds three types of animals. 

Besides the change in placement rules, there are some different scoring rules. They mostly in the involve different workers you can hire; unfortunately the way the the workers score are very pedestrian. While the expansions add a few more workers I didn't find that they were nearly as game changing as others have commented. I also dodn't find the 2p game to be much improved compared to Zooloretto.

I think it's obvious to say I was extremely dissatisfied with Aquaretto, I was expecting a much deeper game based on how folks talk about it. Instead Aquaretto feels like a retread of Zooloretto with a few rules tweaks. The only good thing we got from this are some new animals to add to Zooloretto Junior; my girls love the animals in Aquaretto so I'm not sorry I ended up buying a copy.  [/i]

This one really surprised me.
I have Coloretto, which I enjoy for its simple implementation of an interesting gaming mechanic.
I have played Zooloretto & it was ok, but just seemed to needlessly complicate things.
Aquaretto takes the mechanic of Coloretto and adds enough other elements (free form basins & workers) that can appeal to gamers.
I have just come back from playing with my Thursday work lunchtime group. We played it once & they immediately wanted to play it again, which is a first for any of the games I've brought in.

Well it's the same mechanic as Zooloretto with a different theme and some tweaks - it gets the same rating. It's nice enough, inducing the same decision process - watch what other people are collecting, build take-sets that don't favour anyone in particular, and if possible produce take-sets of animals that you're already collecting. Aquaretto seems to make it easier to make money, and then give you more things to spend money on through the building of multiple zoo extensions to provide space to store more animals. The big change is that when you build the 5th of an animal set, you get a scoring bonus in one of three means (your choice) which can be significant if you've been choosing your sets all along with these in mind. Which of course you have been. But there's no drama or excitement or learning curve that drives me to play again ... much the same as Zooloretto. It's pastime material.

Rating is based on Aquaretto as a stand-alone game.

This was very similar to Zooloretto in terms of mechanics and aims.  The one major difference was that, instead of animal enclosures, players could place animals anywhere on their grids, provided that they were not adjacent to another type of animal.  Players received bonuses for having large groupings of the same animal.  It was an interesting spin on the basic Zooloretto premise.

RATING: 7
Absolutely better than Zooloretto. A lot more freedom & options to gather points. In Zooloretto it was usually so that you had to fill almost everything in your zoo areas in order to win. In Aquaretto there are so many different ways to acquire points that it's almost reliefing after Zooloretto.

Meeple-aspect works. Money is no longer useless if you play your coworkers wisely, wohoo! Only the Manager (only -1 per species in depot) was a bit useless in our first game. I'm sure there is a better way to use them but that didn't occur in this very first game.

Components look really good. Simple and functional. The only thing is that the game would've needed a help sheet. Everybody can't remember the scoring or money/coworker acquirement. But oh well, maybe I'll make my printer to do its job...

This seems to be the game Zooloretto was supposed to be (at least in my eyes)

A slightly advanced version of its famous parent, in that you have more flexibility of how you want the animal clusters to be appear in your enclosures, with the limit of 3 types to start with. Purchases not only allow you to expand but also there are bonus scoring meeples which can either be placed to reduce the pain of animals in "storage", make money worth points or certain fish eating types worth more. All of which provides a sense of being able to overcome bad tile draws and vp catchup. Slightly easier to evaluate than Zooloretto, but just seems to have more fiddly rules, such as coin payouts on every 3rd animal and meeple on every 5th. Still I would prefer to play either design than Ra if I want to experience the psychological hot seat.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is the less popular sister game to Zooloretto.  Based around a Seaworld-type park, each player acquires tiles by the same truck-based method as in Zooloretto.  However, the formation of the park, although governed by rules, appears less structured than in the zoo; certainly, there are no enclosures with a fixed number of spaces.

It's been a while since I played it, and it didn't particularly appeal to my group.  However, as a solitaire 4-handed game I like to play the suggested Aquaretto/Zooloretto combination.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is an expansion for Zooloretto that can be played separately. In terms of mechanics, Aqualoretto is more interesting than Zooloretto because you get to dictate the sizes of each animal pen with your tile placements. The downside is that the player board is less aesthetically pleasing. The animal tiles are still cute however.

Harmless fun. Has the spoil the load / risk the pain mechanism from Medici via Coleretto. The rest is not especially interesting: the spatial element makes little practical difference. The money action does offer the chance to break the rhythm which can be important to shift the decision on to the next player, though if everyone reciprocates you are back where you started. Very similar to Zooloretto - this is more fluid ;-) and slicker but I am not sure it is more fun. Doesn't work as well with 3 players as there are not enough negative points at stake.

I found the game attractive, at least for those people who don't play games that much. Pieces are nice and concept (encolsures with neat looking animals) was promising.

Zooloretto with a twist.  Gone are the fixed pens, added are meeples for variants in scoring.  Making for a different game with much of the same base mechanics.

Again, a family friendly game that is easily played by kids and adults alike.

If one were to get one or the other - might want Aquaretto slightly over Zooloretto.  But both are fine games, so if the animals are cuter in Zooloretto, no harm in using that as a decider.

Not bad! We played for the first time today, and spent at least an hour analyzing the game afterwards.

Upon a second (and third) play, it is clear that we need to add some of the expansions to make the game truly shine. We'll be doing that next. Without them, the game is a bit simplistic.

A refreshing upgrade from Zooloretto which I feel is kind of over complicated with unnecessary add ons.  This is actually a tight game where you constantly feel pressured by your own limitations and the current tile mix up for grabs on the table.
Components are great and the modular plaer boards are an improvement (in play at least) from the predecessor.

My initial reaction was that this is a pale imitation of Zooleretto (without changing enough to make it a genuinely separate game), but I think I may have short-changed it; in particular, I think the enclosure design aspect that the use of workers offers possibilities absent from its parent.  Awaits further plays.

A deeper game than Zooloretto, and the spatial element makes it more of a gamer's game. But I think I liked it less because of that, and because the theme / animals aren't as fun as Zooloretto. So, if you're going for a gateway / family game, I'd take Zooloretto, but if you want something a bit heavier -- but not as a heavy as an Alea big box -- go with this.

I prefer the original land-based version for it's greater simplicity, but that's not to say that this is not a very good game.  If you want a more 'gamery' version of the original - you should check it out.  Sufficiently different enough for it to stand on it's own.

I think I like Aquaretto better than Zooloretto. When I heard that Aquaretto could be an expansion for Zooloretto I as excited - I imagined trucks with both Zoo animals and Waterpark animals, and you'd have to manage all that. Then I read the rules for it last night - turns out you are playing 2 separate games, and on either turn you are playing one of the 2. Lame.

Also, I'm not a huge fan of the strict stack order in Aquaretto's Depot. I don't see what that adds to the game, but I see where people can get screwed because they have a juicy animal up for sale, and before anyone has money to buy it they inadvertently have to cover it up.I do like the $1 income each time you get a 3rd/6th/9th/12th of a type. I wonder if the income shouldn't increase as you go up in numbers... but maybe on further plays I'll see more large basins (I had a 10-Seal basin last night).

It seems a lot easier to score off of Keepers than Cashiers. Trainers seemed weaker too, but they're not bad if you plan right. You can score up to 8 off a trainer, I saw 9 off a single Keeper... I can't imagine finishing a game with Cashiers and still having 8 or 9 coins because in order to get coins you have to make big basins, and to do that you have to spend coins... I suppose you could take animals that are good for other people and hope they buy them - but if they don't then you are screwed with those animals in your Depot. Also, the Manager shouldn't ever be worth 8 points!!! That's easily the weakest space to put your coworker! Well, that or Cashier...

I really like Coloretto and somewhat like Zooloretto.  It was only natural to expect that I would give this one a try.  Unfortunately, I really was not impressed with this.  I did kind of like being able to build up the areas of the zoo.  I didn't really care for the other change, particularly the differing types of animals and the workers.  It's almost like the game is trying to be something that it is not.  Still would generally rather just play Coloretto than either of the others.  [01/08/2011]

Aquaretto --

I did not care for Zooloretto when I played it years ago. For some ineffable reason, I liked this much more.

Actually, I think it was due at least partially to the reduced number of players. I played Zooloretto with more players, and it seemed that the selections available when my turn rolled around were too haphazard (or intentionally bad). 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
After playing Coloretto I see why I don't enjoy this one. Coloretto is simple and other people's sets are clearly visible across the table. Here: you have to think too much about where to put pieces you've gotten, do you need to build or not, how to get money, how to get workers, all the bonuses, and in the end you have to put some effort in trying to discern what others are collecting. 

Hence a light game comes to crawling halt of analysis paralysis. Sure, it's cuter, but oh how it drags. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A more unforgiving version of Zooloretto. Instead of individual pens for animals, the board here is one large pen and you need to manage placement and expansion of species carefully or you will get hosed.

Some rules are fiddly (ie: you get a coin for 3, 6, 9th animal, you get a worker token for every 5th and 10th),

Otherwise, the system is pretty similar. Still don't get why the background of the aquarium is 'green'. 

Plus the 'expansion' claims are complete BS. According to the rules, you're essentially managing two seperate games at the same time.

From Shire Games

The Good: Easy and quick. Not as restrictive regarding enclosures as Zoo... Expandable play area. Wifey approved.

The Bad: Workers not balanced in base game. Also have noticed that if you're not on the ball, games can suddenly end before you want it to.

However despite this, still a good game that plays in under an hour with 4.

This feels more fun when playing as an expansion than as a standalone game and so the rating is based on it being played as an expansion with Zooloretto.  The symbols on the tiles and the meeples are both positive enhancements to the game !

I really enjoy the production of the Zooloretto games.  And heck I enjoy the games too.  As with everybody else, I think Aquaretto is a slightly better game.  But I agree that it is worth owning both if you are a fan.  If you have to buy just one, go with Aquaretto even though in my opinion, it is a slightly less attractive game.  I wish there were some way they could have worked out a way to represent graphically the expanding animal enclosures.  Because they didn't do this, Aquaretto feels a bit abstract.  Your completed "water zoo" doesn't look like anything you would find in the real world.

Having already played Zooloretto, this game is VERY similar.  So of course the first thing I was looking for was which mechanics were different.  I have to admit I didn't like most of them -- the stacking in the pen was odd to search through for opponents, and I really didn't like the expandable boards either.   One thing that was terrific were the meeples and their abilities, definitely the best part of the game.  Why are the fields grass?  Should have been water.  Either way, buy Zooloretto instead.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Similar to Zooloretto, but with enough changes to make it a different game (although you can also play this as an expansion to Zooloretto, where you're basically playing both games simultaneously):
- instead of pre-defined pens, you have an open space in which you create pools by playing animal tiles of a specific type, grouped together (orthogonally adjacent, cannot be adjacent to different species)
- instead of open barnyard to house extra animals, you have a depot where they are stacked; only the top tile is available for manipulation (sell to other players, discard from game, move to your pool)
- no more species-swapping allowed
- additional way to get money: the 3rd, 6th and 9th of a species played to a pool gives you 1 money
- additional scoring (replacing stalls): the 5th (and 10th?) of a species gives you a meeple, which you may place either on the board (trainer, scores 1VP per adjacent trainable animal) or on some bonus locations (bonus 1VP/gold, or 1VP/fish icon on tiles).

While the basic mechanism remains the same, all these changes take a further step away from Coloretto, making this game a bit more challenging. After just one play, however, I think Zooloretto may be my preference: not as simple (and boring) as Coloretto, but not quite as difficult as Aquaretto. Not to say that this game is particularly difficult ... just more difficult than I'd prefer to play often. On the other hand, if I played any of these games repeatedly, I could see my preferences moving towards Aquaretto.

I just prefer good old fashioned Coloretto, since it distills the game down to the elements I like best.  Both Zoo and Aqua are too rulesy for my taste.  In other words, complexity is added without making the game more interesting or enjoyable, so they actually have the opposite effect.  I wouldn't turn down a game, but will play the original if given the choice.

Before I begin, I will make it clear that this is a rating for Aquaretto as a stand-alone game, since I haven't played it as an expansion along with Zooloretto.  Anyhow, this is a definite improvement over Zooloretto (which isn't necessarily saying much)!  With this game, I finally have some meaningful decisions to make, and I actually have some real live (though rather wooden) employees for my zoo.  (P.S. Those workers are improved with the following variant:  http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/318661.)  And if my wife's sole goal is to collect as many sea turtles as she can, and my wife's friend's sole goal is to have as many baby animals as she can, who's going to fault them for that?  Certainly not me, when I win the game (too bad I still lose)!  But unfortunately, the player tiles STILL don't look anything like an aquatic zoo.  Game design:  3.5/5  Personal enjoyment: 2/5  Total: 5.5/10

24/08/2011 - I find this more interesting than Zooloretto. The enclosures are pretty interesting for one; there aren't any fixed ones. Instead you get a 5x5 grid (with no corners) as your starting zoo. When u place a animal tile on the grid, that creates its enclosure. You need to place the same animal types next to each other thus growing the enclosure. The catch is that no two animal types can be placed adjacent to each other (although they can touch diagonally). You can pay coins to add bits of more land to your zoo so that your enclosures can grow some more. 

The only thing that is fiddly about Aquaretto is the 3,6,9,12 and 5,10 rule. Once an enclosure reaches 3,6,9,12 tiles in size, you get a coin. Once an enclosure reaches 5,10 tiles in size, you get a little meeple who can be placed in the zoo as zoo-keepers. Zoo keepers earn extra points based on what animal types they're next to at game end. They also take up space in the grid. It's easy to forget to take your coin or meeple when your enclosure reaches those sizes.

But its a very decent game and feels like an elegant re-implementation of Coloretto.

Aquaretto improves on Zooloretto on nearly all fronts.  Removing the zoo cages leads to more strategic gameplay AND simpler scoring at game's end.  Aquaretto still lacks tension, however.

A nice game os set collection and tile placement - the game works really well with the mechanics of [thing=5782][/thing] and [thing=27588][/thing]. Gameplay is fast and engaging. However, without the expansions, the power of the workers in the feeding area have no match, so the "cristian" animals are worth much more than the others. Go for the expasions for the new functions for the workers if you manage to find them.

Rated as a stand-alone game, not as an expansion to Zooloretto.

As with [gameid=27588], the board and money actions leaven the too-strong "screw your neighbor" aspect of Coloretto, and add a variety of tactical options. I slightly prefer the geometric play of the Aquaretto basins to the set-based play of the Zooloretto enclosures, though. It's just more interesting to me.

I like Coloretto as a quick filler, and the "push your luck" element of the card game is re-used in Aquaretto. I chose to purchase Aquaretto instead of Zooloretto, because it's a little more "gamey" and just as accessible. There's a little more to influence, because you can model your waterpark (by determining the size of the individual bassins) yourself. So far, I only played with two and three, and liked it a tiny bit better with three. With more players, the fun can only increase. First play felt a little bland, but our second game was already much, much better. Highly recommended as a relatively quick family game.
UPDATE: Finally got a game in with four, including a 10 and a 12 year old. This truly is a very, very good family game!

RATING: 7
A close cousin of Zooloretto, the game's basic premise and core mechanism from Coloretto remains unchanged. Players still draw tiles and place them on empty slots on a truck or actually picking off from an existing truck. However, I feel that this game is a significant improvement over Zooloretto in multiple ways. I have always disliked the pre-determined pens in Zooloretto with fixed scores. There is not much variation in the game and often times, players can finish off their individual animal pens easily. The game boiled down to penalties or bonus points. Another thing I did not like was the lack of money in Zooloretto. Both these issues have been solved by Aquaretto. Money is easier to come due and the board is more variable. I like being able to design and then remodel tile placements. I also like the idea of worker placement to earn extra points in different ways. I also think that the tank is a great variation of the farm in Zooloretto with excess animals being stacked in a pile within the tank as opposed to randomly placed in the farm. Players are more under the gun for purchasing animals rather than delaying the action. More tension.

The game is not without some minor issues. The fish symbol on tiles for scoring is really powerful, perhaps too powerful.

I like Zooloretto a lot because it's a great, simple game for people who aren't game or rules enthusiasts. Aquaretto is a nice variant. It's a little more complex which makes it a little more interesting to gamers without being too hard to grasp for non-gamers, though the spatial element can add to frustration levels. I don't see a need to own both games, although I will have to try to combined version to make sure.

Good theme and game play and also a good game to get the family into.  A bit more abstract and tactical than zooleretto so it might not appeal to all.

Better than Zooloretto, but not as good as Coloretto.  For whatever reason, the money actions create some nice tension in which decision to make, and how to time your tuns, whereas in Zooloretto they just seemed overly complicated.  I still think that the basic game in its simplest form (Coloretto) is the best of the bunch, but this one isn't a bad entry into the series.

First Play.  I think this would play a lot better with 3 players.  With 5 getting the right trucks and feeling involved wasn't there as much as I think it would be with 3.  Better than Zooloretto, with more options.

Versione marina di Zooloretto, meccanica ben collaudata che funzione molto bene, il gioco è semplice adatto a tutti.
Si cerca di posizionare gli animali nei recinti di un parco Acquatico nel miglior modo possibile.

I like this variation of Zooloretto.  I have yet to combine it with Zooloretto and am curious as to how it plays.  When I read the rules it just seemed like a natural evolution of the Zooloretto rules and I wondered why I would ever want to play Zooloretto again.  Having played it, they are just different enough to maybe be in the mood for one and not the other, but I am now curious why one would ever want to combine them.  I'll revise this when I do.

Another great version of Zooloretto.  Slightly "gamier", but the kids picked it up right away.  I'm not sure which I like better, but it will probably be this one.  The winner in both games I've played used his guys as feeders and won by a large margin.  Coincidence or not?  Time will tell.

Not a completely mindless cash-in on the popularity of Zooloretto, which is nice.

As far as the workers go: The Cashier seems nearly useless, the Manager is for players who seriously screw up, the Trainer can be halfway decent, and the Keeper/fish strategy is tremendously overpowered.  "Keeper" bonus points would be more balanced if there were fewer fish tiles in the game, to be sure.

Aquaretto is fun, despite its shortcomings, but is best played with one of the point-rebalancing small expansions that shifts bonus points away from fish-collecting.  If such a thing actually exists.

[i]Update:[/i]

The unbalanced workers ruin the game. I'll stick to Zooloretto from now on.

I don't like the whole series of games. There seems to be a best choice every time. But even if you take it you may lose. I seem to be in the minority.

Played once (with 5 players). An interesting variation on Zooloretto, which doesn't change (or add) much. I still prefer the streamlined idea from Coloretto. I haven't played the combined version, but I am afraid that might make a much too long game and I am not sure of the possible benefits.

I played it few times with my wife. We like it a lot and it is so cute :) - great family game! After that I got a bit bored with it but recently had a chance to play it 3 players for the first time. It is great fun this way so rating was again raised.

Received it as a prize in a contest held by one of the Polish on-line board game shops (rebel.pl - sorry for the small advertisement but I am really happy and I think they deserve mentioning )

got this in trade for my son, who loves playing with the tiles and animals.

It is a good game, I teally like coloretto. The big brother game. But I gave my copy away, so this fills the 'retto void

Slightly more complex and more enjoyable version of the Zooloretto system.  More flexibility in building and expanding your zoo increases depth and helps keep the game fresh. 

Co-workers are not completely balanced when playing Aqua alone (player with 2 decent keepers will tend win most games, while cashier/manager are not viable without Zoo) however this can be helped by awarding 3 additional coins when choosing the manager.

Like Zoo it plays best with 4 players but does scale better to 2 players with following modifications to the tile supply:
1) remove 2 animal types (vice 3)
2) remove 1 fish/bolt tile from each animal type
3) remove 4 coin tiles

Expansions:
Training Camp - essential
The Trains - excellent
Research Station - good
Technical Area - good
Supply Tiles (XXL) - ok

Looks more interesting than Zooloretto, but I can't justify another full game price for what feels like an expansion to me.  Still thinking about it, though.

The theme of this game is running a zoo full of water animals (its sister game Zooloretto is running a "normal" zoo).  The game play of Aqua seems to be a bit more strategic, but both games can be combined into one big game, so I'm kind of interested in both (I know the theme would be a big hit with my nephew and likely my daughter when she's old enough)

More of the same thing from the designer of Zooloretto.  Yes it is more strategic due to the tile placement restriction, how the unused animals are stacked, as well as the inclusion of the new coworker meeples.  However, that does not necessarily make it a more desirable or a better game.  In fact, I think these new features result in a less family and non-gamer friendly title.  Nice effort nonetheless.

Yes, I know Schacht is trying to capitalize on the popularity of Zooloretto, but here I think he's taken the original system and made it even better.  A marriage of Zooloretto and spacial placement of California, in a way.  Seems more open, with more interesting and varied paths to victory.  Very fun.

Although Aquaretto is too simple for me, I enjoy the childlike glee of building an aquarium and stocking it with exotic animals. The best part is the baby animals, who really add fun to the game. It would be nice if there were more to the game than simply filling trucks, choosing them, and placing your animals, but as is it is good for children.

My high score for this game is 4. 
Thankfully, that's just with one play.

After 1 Play: While the conventional wisdom is that the added spacial element makes this superior to Zooloretto, I'm just not buying it.  Both of these games do away with the beautiful simplicity of the original Coloretto, and what they add isn't even close to as good as what they remove.

Am I the only one who thinks this is the best game out of -retto family? More planning as you have more control over placing tiles in your "zoo"

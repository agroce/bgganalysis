Staff of dragons is the more traditional version, Sacred Grail is hard to get used to.

And they can't all be great. Both these version has some rules that make them more for gamers I guess but we prfer the simplicity of the standard game.

Lost Legacy is an easy game to learn, slightly more complex than Love Letter, the rounds are quick (anywhere from one to ten minutes), and it doesn't get stale since you can swap decks between rounds.

I always have two of the small decks (along with a small Love Letter deck) in a playing-card-case in my bag. It's one of the games I can bust out pretty much anywhere.

RATING: 7.5
With Sacred Grail & Staff of Dragons, we've got six whole Lost Legacy decks we can pick through for a great deal of variety, keeping the gameplay spiced up, something that Love Letter lacks (unless you are picking up the alternate versions like The Hobbit or the superior Batman Love Letter). I don't know how much further they could go, but this is a pleasing little bluffing/deduction card game, and you can pack all of the stuff into one of the larger boxes for easy transport.

RATING: 5
Sacred Grail: Inhibits card-counting by means of conditional card play and permissible lies - which is a good thing; however, the "if after" effect inevitably confuses & ruins far too many rounds to make this expansion enjoyable.  3/10

Staff of Dragons: After the kind of tampering that makes people lose interest in a game, this experience hearkens back to the original - quick, simple, and enjoyable.  7/10

I liked it initially as a gamers version of Love Letter. But eventually I realized it was really not a very good game and that I would rather just play Love Letter if I have 4 players.

The sacred grail was a bit wonky when we played it, perhaps it needs to be played at 4 to reduce the chance of sudden wins. It felt a little overengineered. The Staff of Dragons though is a lot of fun.

This is a gamer version of Love Letter. Even though I like it more than Love Letter, i admit is too simple for Gamers but too difficult to be the 5 minutes gateway game for casual gamers.

In the end, Love letter wins the challenge

Probably the most interesting of the Lost Legacys, want to try mixing it up with other versions more.

RATING: 8
Both of these sets are good -- although Sacred Grail includes some Uno-style "skip the next player or reverse the order of play" that some may not like. Still, the hidden information and questioning in that set are fun. Staff of Dragons involves some simple math. Both of these feature an alternate way to win, other than finding the Lost Legacy or eliminating your opponents.

Sacred Grail is a setup revolving around lying if you have an intrigue card. It's a solid setup with outguessing each players hand but has very little ruin play. If you swapped in 1-2 cards to add some more ruin manipulation, I think this setup would be great.

Staff of Dragons seems a bit odd. It's all about the 2 dragons who kill people based on odd or even total value in discard. A thematic nod to Game of Thrones. A lot of killing of dragons or getting killed by them. I found it to be just ok but it could be interesting to mix in
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
A version of Love Letter with more skill and less luck. It also plays more players and has several decks that you can combine.

I've only played the dragon deck, and it makes players think twice about which cards to play, but it also feels a bit limiting. This style of games only has a simple choice of 2 cards every turn and if only one will cause you to be vulnerable that ruins one of the few choices you will have.

The big problem is that a more complex Love Letter in not necessarily what I want to play. Love Letter works for a mixed group, but if I'm playing with more experienced players I don't really want to play Lost Legacy when there are heavier, more interesting games I could play.

More Lost legacy can't be a bad thing! This scores lower than Starship for me as the Grail set is just as good, but I'm not so keen on the Dragon set.

lost legacy from the love letter style micro games. pull this one out if you have more than 4 players. just mix 2 different lost legacies and you are good to go!

SACREC GRAIL:

FUN: more bluffing and even outright lying.

UNIQUE: after Love Letter and other Lost Legacy variants, this isn't that unique anymore, but there are still only a few micro games that do this much in so few cards.

NEGATIVES: needs an intricate knowledge of the other cards in the set to be able to enjoy this one.

The re-themed art is, surprisingly, fine.

I'm not in AEG's business meetings so I don't know if the old art really wouldn't sell well in non-Japanese markets.
But it seems to me that the old art really makes the game more engrossing.

I think this is my favorite Lost Legacy set to date. Mainly because the two decks feel very thematic. Sacred Grail has a very Game of Thrones-esque intrigue about it, where there is the possibility of lying and deceit. Staff of Dragons is a quick and barbaric bloodbath where people can be eliminated very quickly. So both games are very different, and I appreciate them each for being more distinct from earlier sets. I still enjoy Starship quite a bit, but these might be my favorite games in the series.

This is without doubt the best Lost Legacy release yet - both of these sets are outstanding. The Sacred Grail is probably my personal favourite of the 6, with plentiful opportunities for deduction, but also for misdirection, due to the face-down cards mechanic and the card which allows you to ask others whether they have a specific card (others cannot lie unless they have certain cards in their hand allowing them to). And there is also the strange interaction between the 1, 5 and 3. All in all, it feels even more like a game of deduction in this set.

The Staff of Dragons on the other hand is, in one word, brutal - in a good way of course. Multiple ways to be knocked out, and even to set other players up for someone else to knock them out - and ways to mess with your, and your opponents', investigation speed. It can feel a bit random, but it's very good fun and certainly not any less skilful than the other sets.

This pairing is a must-buy for any Lost Legacy fan, and not a bad starting point for anyone interested in the series (although the Starship and Flying Garden are a bit friendlier).

Two new card sets for Lost Legacy.  I'm really liking this idea of being able to combine and replace cards from different sets for really varied games.  It still lacks the simplicity, elegance, and charm of Love Letter but this is starting to shape up to be a really intriguing game with a decent amount of variability.

In this set they've added "campaign" rules so I guess you can play through a story with the 6 different Lost Legacy sets.  There are also a couple new mechanics like cards that do things depending on what the last played card was.

-Rating 9: The sacred grail brings scheming and devious maneuvers to an extent I have not seen in microgames up until now. 
-Rating 7:Staff of dragons has more direct action reminding me of The starship deck but with some new tricks.
-Overall rating 8: This is the best LL chronicle so far because of the sacred grail that I would say is probably the best set of the first three chronicles.

RATING: 8
Still excellent with enough differences to the previous sets to warrant owning. Sacred Grail adds in a 'lying' element to the game plus hidden cards while Staff of Dragons tries to force playing certain cards to win early, although holding those cards can get you knocked out.

This version has one of my least favorite sets, that being the Sacred Grail cards. I think that the face down mechanic was a miss here, and resulted in just feeling like an overall more random venture than before. The art is still beautiful, and I still enjoy the variety of effects, but it just wasn't as fun. I would, however, suggest mixing some of these cards in with other sets, like replacing some of the other sets numbers with certain cards from this set. If I had to pick part of this set, it would be the dragon portion. The Grail portion felt much more lackluster. Overall, interesting attempt, but just didn't do it for me.

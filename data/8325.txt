Another seminal work by Berg. This foreshadows a lot of
what the OCS provides, in a somewhat simpler package. The
supply and combat odds calculation feels a little clunky,
but at its time it was simply the best operational game 
out there.

Slightly better than the original Afrika, but covers the
theater in very similar manner. The SCS design, from what
I understand, is significantly simpler, and not comparable.
A good choice, if you don't want to spend the time on the
detail of DAK.

My favourite Western Desert game. I've played this more times than I can remember. The abstracted supply works for me, although some have criticized it. I love the depth of OB, right down to South African armoured car battalions. But it's the see-saw nature of the game, like the real war, and the differing limitations of supply on both sides which make for a very satisfying game. Oh, and I really like the extra long map! Very special
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Great North Africa game.  Not too complex.  Not too simplistic.  A real epic challenge of supply.  Map doesn't far well as to today's standards, but otherwise a very well done game.

Impressed with this game. It bucks the trend for magazine games in that this is clever and rather complete design, and mostly well developed. There are a few inconsistencies in the reinforcement OBs as far as i can tell but the rule set works very well. How the game plays out will to a large extent depend on whether the Axis can snatch Tobruk early (April or perhaps May) before the allies can reinforce it fully. After that its a question of whether they can cut it off. This game could certainly produce a historical result but i think its unlikely. Mostly because the desert campaign is so volatile. One serious mistake could cost you the campaign, equally if neither side gets luck or shows real finesse you could get a slog around Tobruk rather than chases up and down the coast. Games will be varied, or at least that's my current impression.
On Tobruk, there maybe an issue with the victory conditions, although this applies to most North Africa games. By making Tobruk enough vps to decide minor victory for the side that holds it you could get players capturing and then digging in until 1943. Neither side would have dreamed of this historically as their objective was to win the war, not game a system. Imo i would have blanket win loss draw conditions. Either you KO the other player, or its a draw. It would instill a more historical mindset.


---------------

Rather initial rating as I am only through a few turns. This game comes in around the Goldilocks zone in terms of simulation complexity. It has all the interesting supply management decisions, where to put your dumps and how to set out a supply network with minimal bean counting. It also scores well on the chrome factor with air combat over Malta and shipping being considered. Both sides have challenging and historical decisions presented to them.

Nice map and counters, fairly complex supply rules. The CRT is too bloodless, so a direct attack on Tobruk will be futile. I still need to learn how to play the Germans.

786- Richard Berg designed a WWII N. African game w/ more replayability than most any other of it's type. It features Rommel's attempt to capture Alexandria & the Commonwealth's heroic efforts to prevent that. There is a short scenario & a campaign version for the whole N. African war. The arrival of U.S. forces at the end of 1942 was our first participation, w/ land forces, in WWII.

As the German player I had a tremendous moment of fun;especially with the rule concerning the capture of the ennemy supply dump. With a little bit of luck this allow you to leapfrog your advance in the desert.
The allied player was so frustrate by Rommel that he never proposed me to play it a second time. Substantial Axis victory.

The way the Reaction Phase works combined with the very high movement allowances can give rise to some gamey tactics. If there's a threat, units that are close to the threat (but more than 2 hexes away) won't be able to react, but a unit far away will be able to come to the rescue just because it happened to start its Reaction Phase within 2 hexes of another ennemy unit. Bletch.

Better than Panzerarmee Afrika - It is a detailed game and does seem to be a bit overwrought. However, it does a good job in capturing many of the elements of the desert War. Yet to complete a campaign game mainly stuck to the scenarios.

Can be combined into a larger campaign with Trail of the Fox from S&T 97.  

 Moves No.58 Aug-Sept 1981 includes "Doctrine for Desert Fox" - strategy advice and variant rules for the game, including Operation Herkules, Detachments, and Desert Patrols.


Strategy & Tactics Special Edition, No.1 Spring 1983 includes "Fox Killed: O'Connor vs. Graziani for North Africa" - a prequel scenario covering the initial fighting between Commonwealth and Italian forces.

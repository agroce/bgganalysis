A very tight economic game.  Well designed, and very tense.  Randomness of the demand tiles can be brutal, but generally they are equally applied to all players.

RATING: 10
Played twice now and really enjoyed the difficult decision in this one.  One of the more painful Wallaces I have played, which only makes me like it more.  A bit unintuitive at first but rewards multiple plays.  Need to refresh myself on the rules so that I can teach.

Update:

Ok, after playing this one several times now I cannot get enough.  Such a truly great game that changes based on the strategies and tendencies of those you play with.  Every game since getting a firm grasp on the rules has been pure joy mixed with agony and mental math.  This is one that continues to surprise and hasn't been a letdown yet.  Really looking forward to getting to 10 plays of this and continuing on from there.

God what an ugly board (mayfair). After a second play the board is no better looking and tthere are just too many moving parts for me to enjoy.  I don't think I like games which involve too much guessing what's going to go on in the near future.  Drawing tiles from a bag ala Ra I can handle, but if I'm having to play chess and think 4 steps a head my brain shuts down.

This game has some legs, that's for sure! There is a lot to think about, and trade-offs all over the place. While not as economically brutal as Age of Steam, it's certainly not an easy game economically. I suppose it wouldn't be a Wallace game without any of that. In short, this is simply brilliant.

I like economic game, so I like Automobile. After one play I very appreciate the way the game is linked with its subject. However I played in many games with better mechanics, I strongly prefer Brass from Martin Wallace games, Still when I will have the opportunity to play Automobile again I will do it with pleasure.

Really boring board, and a dry theme, but it is very enjoyable to play. The calculations are pitched perfectly - not overwhelming, but certainly deep. It demands finding a balance between aggressive competitive play, and playing-it-safe. I like economic games, and this feels like a rather serious, but masterfully designed example.

I don't know what it is about Wallace's economic games, but by and large, I don't think that they're half as much fun as his Waros.  On the negative side, this is dry, prone to AP, rather long to get into at the start, has fiddly rules (though the play is easier than the rules suggest), has little interaction, though buying factories ahead of the others on the track and selling some at the right time can create some nice screwage.  Perhaps it'll grow on me, but equally, it might not.  Just not quite enough fun for me, though it's tight and well-designed enough.

RATING: 7
I want to rate this higher but I just think it will become a bit too samey. The tiles provide too little variation for the strategy and beyond that there's no real randomness so feel like there are some defined strategies to follow. Only worth playing with 4 or 5 as well.

One of my favourite economic games, I thought I knew how to play it but somehow people can sneak a win from under me. Lots to manage with only a limited number of actions to influence the game. 

It's not recommended to play too frequently as you can burn out on it easily as it is quite intense, some people are put off by that though, not sure why (well other than having to play with me), I always play to announce probabilities of how many cars that we can expect to sell to avoid slowing the game down while everyone does it for themselves. Like most good games this is finely balanced and rogue players who don't get the subtlety can break the balance.

Gioco economico in cui si ripercorre la storia dell'industria automobilistica mondiale. 

Investimenti, calcoli, profitti e perdite da valutare ad ogni turno (e sono solo 4.. quindi attenti agli errori!!) per un gioco bello tosto.. ma che da soddisfazione.

Secondo me imprescindibile.

RATING: 9
I have rare praise (for me) for this game.  First, I really like Martin Wallace's wargames, but I have not liked his Eurogames, but this is an exception.  It has a good theme and strong mechanics.  It is not an easy game, but it is not overwrought with too many components to optimize.  You make money: plain and simple and the one who gets the most wins.  You build cars and sell them and people want the latest and greatest.  Pretty straight-forward.

This is pretty much the top end of "complexity" I want in a Eurogame.  The reason why is because I think the "complex" ones (and I use that phrase loosely) just attempts to create another optimization puzzle with more and more parts to optimize and I find that dreadfully dull.  When I want complex, I play wargames, so I have can have complexity with meaning, theme, and purpose.
The game is 4 turns long and each turn has 3 actions for each player to take.  Each action is one of five choices (and the 5th is basically "pass") so while the perfect strategy is not apparent in your first play, you can understand what is happening and you can quickly learn from your mistakes for the next game.

Kuddos to Martin Wallace.  This one is worthy to place alongside your wargames!

RATING: 9
After one play you can see how impressive this game is. All of the new players in the initial game foiudn the decisions hard to make because there are many options. The limit of 3 actions per round is hard and in a 4 player game there are only 4 rounds, so 12 actions during the whole game seems so few. But these actions are so cleverly woven that you need to understand the long term implications which you cannot appreciate in your first game.

One of Martin Wallace's best games and may rise to a 10 after more plays.

RATING: 5
This should be a better game than it is.  The engine is a bit too complex for the game.  And the penalties are a bit too punishing for getting something wrong.  Yeah, it's a Martin Wallace game and pain and punishment is to be expected, but this time it just isn't [i]fun[/i] pain and punishment.  Maybe if the engine were trimmed a bit?  Maybe if it felt a hair less chaotic (which is a strange thing to say because it isn't entirely chaotic)?  I dunno.  It just doesn't work for me and the final product is... not fun for me.  I'd play this from time to time, but I might grouse a bit while doing so.

I think I made some bad choices in the first round, and the game was short enough I couldn't recover.  The factories don't remain useful long enough.  The other players at the table seemed to be able to balance it, so I'll have to play it again before I make my final thoughts

:cry: :snore: :) :) :yuk: Grudgingly tried it once, it's OK I guess, but just not really my thing, as is the case with the majority of snowball economic games. 

I can get roughly the same style of game with less "noise" by playing Locomotive Werks. 

The best I can give this is "Well, I guess it didn't suck as much as Indonesia." 

Also one huge flaw, all the executives (or whatever they're called) where you select in turn order do not have their powers listed on the board and there is no cheat sheet except for the rule book. That's a major design oversight, in my opinion. 

Opinion also soured in that I felt like some of the rules were not totally explained clearly to me until after I took an action, thinking they worked differently, and was not allowed to change it after with a casual dismissal of "Well, now you know," but other people somehow kept changing *their* moves around. I'm not big on learning new games in the first place and when things like that happen I remember yet another reason why.

Not that I've played a great many, but this is the best Martin Wallace game I have ever played. And visually,  it's an absolutely gorgeous game (at least in the Mayfair edition: other versions may prove to be graphically ugly)!
I have exceedingly little interest in the early American auto industry, yet Automobile has proven to be a winner for me. An extremely tense economic game that requires considerable attention to every little thing that everyone does. It's a reasonable facsimile of a real world economy, but it's still a euro. If you want a true economy in a box, play Container. 
The uncertainty as to the demand for automobiles every turn adds just enough randomness to the game to keep it from being even remotely dry. 
One of the best brain-burners I have ever played; and an AP prone player's heaven. It's better not to mention to them that you own this one!
My only major complaint is the complete and utter lack of player aids, for which the game is crying out. Their absence is a crime which must be brought before the Game Crimes Tribunal in Essen.

3-5(5)

It's a really tough game to explain and, despite the fact that you only execute twelve actions throughout the game (four of which are inevitably producing cars), there's a lot of thinking and fiddling.

So, the game mechanisms and dynamics actually work pretty well. You do need to be constantly upgrading your factories and closing down old factories and there is jockeying to sell your cars and such.

However, there are actually only twelve actions (with, granted, other decisions such as what role to take, how many cars to make, which executive decision to select, etc.), which does seem a little thin. On top of that, it's pretty abstract and a bit convoluted, especially regarding how and when you get to sell cars. Further, there's fiddliness abound regarding having to sell the cars (sequentially) and loss cubes and all that. Also, the relative arbitrariness of the demand tiles, which can be backbreaking depending on how they turn out.

I think the game has a lot of clever mechanical elements for a market simulation and all that but the game flow feels a bit scripted (e.g. at which points do certain cars see demand and what demand they'll find) and the fiddliness diminishes the payoff.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Typical Martin Wallace design, so many choices but so little actions.  You have to sort of balance your car production versus hidden demand.  I only went for luxury card & std size and didn't do the econ model due to the other 3 players all trying to flood the market with the cheap model.  Ended up as 2nd place.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I've had some fun playing Automobile.  Unknown demand gives the game some delicious angst, but I think it is also problematic.  With four or five players, your single demand tile for two varieties of car tells you nothing meaningful about total demand.  So either you play the percentages or you gamble on freakish demand.  

There is a lot of maths in Automobile; figuring out average demand, counting little cars produced, subtracting distributors, not forgetting Howard's two sales, figuring out what all that means for you.  That's rather more calculation than I enjoy. 

Automobile has some nice, thematic elements and a greater degree of player interaction than some give it credit for. The surest way of winning seems to be to dominate production of one type of car.  Other players can certainly mess with that strategy.

After four games I question Automobile's replay value. Its systems feel very constrained, the scope for exploring alternative strategies quite limited.

Great economic game with a strong theme. You must balance your production and evaluate the market while you try to screw your opponents and manipulate the turn order. Very well designed game. The mechanics are simple and easy to teach. Only downside is that the game is a bit 'mathy'. But its a economic game. What did you expect??

Rating after a single play.  Very interesed in playing this one again.  Game 1 was a 4 player game with all of us newbies.  I believe that I was the only player that hit upon what should be a major strategy in the game " PRODUCE VEHICLES"
Everyone else played conservatively and although I took a loan in the early game to fund production, I still won by a large margin.  Really would liek to play this in the near furure to better solidify my opinions.

An interesting and very nice thematic game where the decision making felt closely tied to how much money you have on hand (or want to acquire through a loan) and how lucky you felt regarding the chit pulls and white/gray cylinder draws of other players.  

The game gets major props for thematics and refreshing originality, but it just didn't quite feel compelling or replayable to me after one play. I feel like I want to play it again, but after that second play, I am not so sure.  Still, a very good, interesting game design worth playing.  Giving it a 7 of 10.  September 2012.

After second play, yes, it is true I do not want to play it again.  Curiously, if I wanted to play a game like this, I would prefer Tinner's Trail.  Downgrading to a 6.  November 2015.

One half of one play using incorrect rules (0/1/3/+ rather than 1/3/6/+ build-ahead costs), so I'm not comfortable assigning it a rating.  Of what I saw, I think I liked a decent amount of it.  There were complaints about menial accounting (e.g. counting produced cars), and I can understand them.  I'd be happy to play again, and suspect that I'll like it but probably not find it worth a whole two hours.  I was last in turn order, which really limited initial choices.

A nice Wallace title, but not likely his best.  The game has a nice collection of mechanics that work well together, but are not aligned with the theme as deeply as the theme should permit.  There is a separation between the mechanics and theme that give the impression that the mechanics could have been adopted for a variety of other game themes - bu the auto industry just happened to be the one.  That said, Wallace does a solid job making the game bring in historical details about the auto industry.  I like the game and think it plays well, but it is not the Wallace title that I say 'Ah ha!" to.

Way too many rules for what you get from them.  Too much math.  Not enough meaningful decisions.  Tedious and repetitious play.  Not very much player interaction. More like office work than a game.  Unknown demand means everyone is making random guesses.  Who wants to calculate that much, and then have the outcome be based upon something no one can influence any control over.  It's too much like real life.  Games should allow us to either forget about the problems of real life, or transcend them.  This game does neither.

I suppose this would be considered a "hardcore Eurogame." What I found is that I didn't get a whole lot of satisfaction from playing it. It's similar to a game in the same way that baseball is similar to a sport.

Let me expand on that little comparison:

Baseball as a sport is largely boring. There's a lot of downtime and athleticism doesn't play a HUGE part in the game. However, when baseball becomes interesting is when you break it down into its components. Baseball is a game made up of hundreds of minigames. There's the mini-game where the pitcher keeps an eye on the runner on first while attempting to make a pitch (or decides to pick off the runner on first). There's the mini-game between the pitcher and batter. There's the mini-game between the manager and the opposing pitcher - determining the correct batting order. The list can go on extensively, but I feel I've made my point.

Automobile is largely the same. You have the mini-game of choosing which "personality" you want. You've got the mini-game of trying to one-up your opponents on having the most recent factory. The game of trying to guess how much demand there will be for any given pigeonhole, and so on.

The difference is if I sit down to watch baseball and begin drinking heavily, I'll start becoming really entertained in heckling the pitcher/batter/umpire/peanut vendor. If I were to do the same in Automobile, I'd get kicked out of whoever's place I was gaming at. 

There's the possibility I didn't really give this game a fair shake. I'd probably try it once more. I feel that there probably is some pretty intense strategy that goes into it once you've played it 9 or 10 times, but it's so abstracted with regards to what's a "good" play and what's a "bad" play that it's hard to stay interested.

And now it seems I've written a novel on a game I've only scored a 3.

Having read the rules, I was really looking forward to this.  But the play fell flat - too long (and I fear time won't come down much, as there is a fair amount of calculation involved) and too repetitive.  There isn't much feeling of progression - more iteration of what has already happened.  The board is lovely, and I would happily play if asked, but I am trading my copy away.

Mások véleménye alapján ennél számolgatósabb játékra számítottam. És kevésbé szórakoztatóra. Vagyis kellemes meglepetés volt!
Számolgatós igen, de nem abnormálisan. A kereslet bizonytalansági tényező, de nagyjából lehet vele kalkulálni. Az a fajta játék, ahol egész kis forgatókönyv ír le egy fordulót:) Szerencsére az újabb kiadáson szemléletes ábrák utalnak az egyes lépésekre. A kivitelezés egyébként is nagyon profi (itt a korábbi kiadás fa alkatrészei helyett vastag lapkák dominálnak).
A játék elég nagy része teljesen egyedi, általam ismert más játékokhoz nem hasonlítható mechanizmusokból áll. Végig nem lehet tudni, ki áll nyerésre. Nagyon szűkös a pénz, de nem szabad megijedni a kölcsön felvételétől (Megjegyzés: tetszik, hogy ilyen sokféle címletet adtak a játékhoz...). Nagyon figyelni kell, hiszen összesen 12 akciónk van a 3-4 óra során (nekünk ennyi volt 5 fővel). 1 elhibázott, vagy akár csak balszerencsés akció meghatározhatja a végeredményt. A 6 karakter közti választás teszi igazán sokszínűvé a palettát. Így az első játék után legalább 3-4 féle alapvetően különböző stratégia jutott eszembe, mindnek megvan a maga kockázata, de szerintem mindegyik esélyt kínál a győzelemre. Ez az újrajátszhatóság mellett szól! Egy tanulság, amit levontam: a gyárak bezárásával csínján kell bánni, bár néha muszáj, és előnyökkel is jár, de azért fixen elég sokat bukunk rajta.
Összességében jó játék, máskor is játszanék vele, de azért nem az a bármikor előveszem kategória.
---
A 2. játék után kezd körvonalazódni egy a többinél erősebb stratégia (sok kis gyár...). Ha ez így van, az nem éppen pozitívum, de majd még tesztelni kell.

Limited edition.  Received as a present of my friend Shurti ;)
Pretty difficult to explain, not so much to play if you are used to this kind of games.  Economic game with a few things to take into account.  It seems to me that you really take actions with a clear purpose, and I like it.  You are not driven by your feelings, you can most of the times really think what you need to do.  Of course, you may fail...  Tree Frog has made a nice production, cars are quite nice, and the board really shows you almost everything in the game.
Not too long, nice to play, very good game, you really feel in the business.  Fantastic.

RATING: 7
This is a very interesting economic game, with an intriguing theme and well integrated mechanics (the obsolescence and R&D are simple but very elegant rules).
Player's have only 12 actions to create a business by producing and selling cars during the first decades of mass automobile production, and the low number of actions and turns seems a good tension generator.
Oddily, the quantity of available stuff is the same with 3, 4 or 5 players, so with less than the full 5 players the tension is inferior.
This needs more plays for a complete evaluation, but at first sight could be another hit from Wallace...

Initial Impression: This game has a Martin Wallace feel to it. The turn structure is simple but the play is deep. There's alot of indirect interaction in this game, with people claiming areas of the outer track, forcing production and technology prices up, and jockeying to sell their stock of cars first.

RATING: 5
Too scenariobased game, in fact you play 3 and a half actions of which 2 of them are in fact necessary (building a factory and production). All the rest is following the scenario. Wallace is a great author, but from time to time a miss is allowed.

Automobile reminds me of Martin Wallace's Tinners' Trail.  In Tinners' Trail players have to guess when to sell.  The rate of return is based on a die roll.  If you guessed correctly, you will probably win.  In Automobile players have to guess how many cars to produce.  The number of produced cars to be sold each round is based on a tile draw.  If you guessed correctly, you will probably win.

This game really surprised me with how interesting it was.  It's hard to call a game that's both thinky and mathy "fun" per se, but it was enjoyable enough to make me look forward to playing it again.  The way the mechanics reflect the theme are deep and satisfying, which was another unexpected element.  I'm worried about experienced players really "figuring out" this game or perfecting their strategies, but there is definitely some player interaction (and a little luck) that can keep players from deciding their future in advance.  A really neat albeit initially intimidating game.

First play: The systems are complicated so a dummy first round is highly recommended/ essential.

The mechanisms are clever and there's alot to think about in the economics of running your business, however our group at best found it a little dry down to not wanting to play again.

I'd like a second play just to see if there is any more going on but there is no real wow factor and;

1/ There is very little interaction and oportunity to nudge other players off course.

2/ There would appear to be a huge chance of AP with the wrong crowd.

However the production quality is superb. 

2nd Play: A six year gap before I play this again. I think I have better respect for the cleverness of the game but still have no idea how to succeed. My previous comments still stand but if the price was right I probably would buy it.

This is an interesting problem to solve, but I'm just not convinced that I have much fun figuring it out. 

Update: I tried it again and it confirmed the above statement for me. I even took first against three other experience players. My reaction, "oh....good. What's next?" It's a nice, original design, but just not fun. 

2016 update: pulled this off the shelf and had a good time with it. I think my appreciation for Wallace games has only grown over the years.

Theme is important to me in games, and normally I have no interest what-so-ever in games involving cars or trains.  But I have to say, this was a fun game.  I don't know if I'd buy it, but I'd definately play again.

Requires a lot of thinking (and math) if you really want to play to win, and that means downtime, but that usually doesn't bother me.  Next time I think I need to play with a scratch sheet of paper.

After 3 games:  I continue to enjoy this game despite the fact it's not my "typical" game.  I've added it to my wishlist.  Rating it a 9 for now, it may go down after a few more plays, but I'm guessing this will always be at least an 8 for me.

During the time the game was explained to I thought. Hey another Wallace design that is rather opaque at the beginning. The first half of play I was enjoying myself while discovering the game. The second half of the game I think I saw it for what it really was. Another economic game with too much open information. This turns it into an accounting exercise and analysis paralysis paradise. Again Wallace makes you feel like you have a lot of influence in the game while in reality more than half the possible actions at any given time are just not worth it. So if you take the time to analyze the game it sort of plays itself. But playing that way also sucks out all the fun. So I decided to play the last part of my only ever play of Automobile, making every decision from a gut feeling. And naturally I made a mistake which cost me the game. But at least it was over. I played the 999 Dutch version of the game and must say I was impressed with the components. Too bad there is not a player aid included.

Initial impression:

Feels like a lot of chrome and no substance; the game is rather opaque as a result of the chrome, however, so I'll need to play it again.

The distributors in particular feel disturbing to me; although they reduce the randomness, particularly that in grabbing one tile for expensive cars.

This is a great game, and I'm not just saying that because I won my first time out with five players (though I'm sure that had something to do with it).  I've heard it can get a bit stale with repeated plays, but I'm betting I won't get it to the table often enough to have that problem.  

Edit: Played a 2-player variant today while teaching a friend of mine at lunch.  Not as tight of a game as it would be with more players, but still very engaging and fun.  I bumped my rating of this game because it is now satisfactorily playable with two.

This was the first of the heavier Wallace games I've played.  The first time through, I felt like I was chewed up and spit out by the game.  I struggled.  I played it again about a year later and was chewed up and spit out again.  In the second round, I shut down a factory that reduced cash flow and my opportunity to produce vehicles just too much.  I made a lot of mistakes in this game (e.g. choosing Howard when I didn't really have many vehicles to sell; not getting distributors on the board until turn 3, etc.), but the shutting down of my factory on turn 2 seemed to be the end for me.

I wanted to try it at least one more time to see if I could muster a reasonable score out of it.  I got that chance and finally did well.  It was a game with 4 players which wasn't quite as good, but still okay.

This isn't a game I'll seek out.

There are few theme games that really work - for example, in Lost Cities you can't win unless you take risk, an aspect of investing that is hard to capture.  Automobile feels like you're making decisions that an entrepreneur would make in the heady days of auto first creation, which was much like the computer boom of today.  Gamers who demand "small engine" games won't like it, you have to be strategic instead of just tactical.  
My favorite game of all time.

This is an amazing game. It is economic war in a box. It plays smoothly. Those in your group that are walking calculators will love this game however they are not guarenteed a win because there is the slightest of unknown in the game which means they need to have more than a calculator. They must have intuition and business savvy. There are several layers to this game that make it a joy to replay and will not be visible on your first play. This game is worth owning even if you own Indonesia. IMHO Automobile is a much better economic game than Wealth of Nations or Containers, such that I won't even play those games again. My collection is about owning 10's and 9 not 8s and below.

This game is a gamers game however it is easily teachable to someone who has graduated from gateway games. In other words this would be an excellent economic game for the intermediate gamer.

Time it takes to play is excellent for the what the game gives back in fun, tension and experience. Martin Wallace has proven himself again to be an excellent designer with this game.

I love this game, it is worth the investment and I recommend it to gamers, Wallace Fans and players that are finished with gateway games. 

In short, Automobile is a big game with many little mechanics that work together. It's an exercise in manipulation of turn order and precedence to try and work production and sales together but apart from financial opportunity cost in paying to build unsalable cars the stream of loss cubes from bad decisions doesn't seem so bad. With all the mechanics and special actions and turn order mechanics combined it's a little difficult to get a complete picture of where things are, but there aren't that many really big pointy corners waiting to catch you.

Session report conclusion
Despite my poor performance in the critical third turn I’m totally enamored with this game. I haven’t been able to stop thinking about it, and I can’t wait to play again. All of the mechanisms really mesh together well to simulate the feeling of running a business (if not completely thematically, you at least feel like you’re making critical decisions that go straight to your bottom line). 

The four turns are structurally identical but each feels different than the last because the relative demand is adjusted between each turn, and players are ramping up their production. Even within a turn the tension really builds, as you try to decide how much to produce, then how to possibly sell everything given what everyone else has produced. When those demand tiles are flipped over it’s actually a tense moment.

Sigh! I think I should accept that I just don't enjoy Martin Wallace games. This had all the things you expect from MW - pasted on theme, multiple clunky phases in each long round, stock market (or at least in this case, economic) type mechanics driving very slow turns (lots of time spent adding up the costs and implications of each possible choice), lots of teeny cubes and so on.

And it came in at 4 hours (one hour per round!).

At least 3 of us at the table were visibly flagging including me (and I won). I love long games, I love meaty games, but Mr Wallace and I have very different ideas of fun.

This is not my kind of game....AT ALL.  It's a dry, boringly themed Euro, that is procedural and mathy.  I'd rather try and suck down a bowl full of cinnamon than sit through this game.

Wallace does it again with perhaps his most stressful game to date. Under producing sucks, overproducing sucks even more. It does have some luck due to the random tiles drawn but in this case it just makes the game more exciting.

Although I love this game, those who don't care for number crunching (weird people) will struggle with this game to the point of giving up. There is a lot of math involves and the game is so unforgiving that it will feel like Martian Wallace himself is kicking you in the face if you make a calculation error.

I want to  play this 5 player before I am too harsh with it.  With 4 players and only 3 automobile types, it seems that the competition can be lopsided.  Hopefully 5 players ensures competition across all the markets / distributors / etc.  Also, there just isn't enough "game" here.  Very few decisions to make and most of them seem pretty obvious.  The game turns into who makes a bad decision first, and how many other players does he take down with him?  ugh.

Another excellent offering from Martin Wallace. I happen to like Martin's approach to theme implementation, although I know some others find it maddening. The inter-relationships seem intuitive enough that I don't find myself needing to rationalize how everything works to appreciate the game.

Players invest in three categories of automobile (cheap, mid-range, and luxury) and in progressively newer versions of each. You have to balance outlay (cost of factories and cost of auto production) versus how many cars of the various types you hope to sell. Whoever has the most money at the end of the game wins.

Does it all make sense? Probably not if you put it all under a microscope, but in game terms it works the way you would expect. Cheap car factories cost less, the cars they produce also cost less to make, and you can churn out a lot of them - but they don't sell for very much. Luxury car factories are the most expensive as is the per car cost of production but they sell for a lot more - however the number of cars each factory produces is very low in comparison. Naturally, the mid-range car factories are between the two. The kicker is that the demand for each type of car is not exactly known, but there are a couple of ways to sell cars that mitigates that aspect of the equation.

The bottom line is that each turn (and there are only four), you are guessing how many cars of each type the market will absorb, and how many of these categories the other players will concentrate on. Based on these factors you will plan your own investments. Miscalculate by too much and you will suffer stiff financial penalties. Guess right and you will make out like a bandit! The cool part is that your calculations are not done entirely in the dark - but surprises can happen.

Once again, Martin delivers a game that reveals more each time you play and experience will be a definite asset. There will be a definite learning curve but I look forward to it!

Played 5 times and I'm done with this now.

My main problems with the game are: 

Random Market - dull and a huge element of luck that I don't want in this sort of game. Yes you have partial information but it is of little use, as you have to assume others are making their choices based on their information, so in the end it's a shot in the dark unless you know the other players very well.

Player interaction - yes there's some (mostly incidental), but not as much as I'd like.

Biggest decision in the game is turn order - and everthing follows after that. 

I end the game feeling it would be ok as a 1/2 hour game but not 2 hours - there's not enough game, by which I mean meaningful/critical decisions and enjoyment (rather than bean counting and AP).

The theme isn't really important.  In fact the gameplay doesn't immediately make me thing automobiles.  Additionally, the whole black cube thing doesn't seem to be as important as the game mechanics would indicate.  After two of the roles are related to black cubes.  So the game doesn't feel "tight" to me.

However, that doesn't mean that it's not a good game, because it is.  There are a lot of decisions and proper planning is important.  Bad planning costs money, impacting one's ability to win.

So I'd like to try this some more.

types. Not sure how much value they would add for most

I got Automobile for two reasons: it seemed like Martin Wallace in the vein I love best (that is, the Brass vein), and it was an interesting theme.  Of course we intended to play primarily with two, and the existence of a variant on the 'geek was incentive enough.  So, I managed to snag it for a good price from a shop in Great Britain, and after 8 weeks of anticipation, it finally arrived.  Our first Treefrog, our first MW signature... (sigh).

And how is it, you may ask?  Well, with the 2 player variant, it was not good at all.  This is NOT a game that can be adjusted for two in the same way Brass can.  There was no tension, no decisions, no reason to build new factories.  Basically, I came to understand that this game is ALL about chaos, trying to make the best with limited information, and the claustrophobia brought on by multiple players.  With 4? It is not great. Ok fun, but nothing exceptional. It is not overly long, though, so worth giving at try, especially if you like MW designs.

RATING: 7
Yet another heavy economic game from Martin Wallace. It's really a brilliant design, streamlined and tight, but this is just not my type of game. At one point on my turn I did nothing but sit in silence, for five minutes, counting. I'm sure I made the game about as fun for the other players as it was for me, but for some reason I'm incapable of playing these kinds of games without trying to micromanage my money.

More plays would probably make me more comfortable with the mechanics such that I wouldn't need to calculate every decision so precisely, but I don't know how often I'll want to play this. I tend to prefer games where you can play intuitively, not analytically. Everyone in my gaming group loves these number-crunching games, however, and they are all much better at them than I am. I guess I'll just suck it up and keep playing. Sigh.

This design is too scripted for my liking. Lately, I much prefer "open" game turns where I can do things in the order of my choosing. Games like Automobile have a very strict ordering of phases which makes the gameplay feel constrained. No doubt this style of design is easier to balance during playtesting, but I do not enjoy the restricted feel.

It's an economic Wallace - amongst my favourite type of games - and probably one of his best.  Unlike Brass, this is a game where the connection between actions is apparent after reading the rules but the extra twists added by executive decisions in particular add a nice layer of decision making.  Looking forward to seeing how it plays with more players and more experience - a first play with three took us only halfway round the board and I suspect more plays/players will take us much further to the point where the loss cubes really pile up.  A play with four confirmed and reinforced positive first impressions - this is a cracker, it just fits together in a way that makes sense - all nicely rounded corners and no sharp edges.  Now looking forward to playing with five - but with experienced players only I think else it might be a tad slow.

What an awful game. I cannot be said to be a fan of Martin Wallace games of course, but I usually enjoy them enough for a play or two. But Automobile has to be his most wretched offering in quite some time, far beyond simply being a little clunky or inelegant; after about the halfway mark it was pure agony to play. Overwhelming, gratuitous complexity, complete themelessness and total opacity, and a tendency to get bogged down in extreme AP ... it was just no fun at all. And the game has the classic Martin Wallace traits of significant imbalance, in that it gives you the illusion of many choices but in practice only a few are valid, but it's an excruciating amount of work to figure out which those valid choices are.

It also doesn't help that this is an almost complete retread. It's just bits of Brass, bits of Age of Steam, bits of Tinner's Trail, all thrown together with little regard for aesthetics or coherence. There is startlingly little original thought on display here. If, like me, you value some small amount of artistry in games, avoid Automobile like the plague.

On balance, this went far beyond the indifference  to cordial dislike I usually feel for Wallace games; I actively hated this game. It's so completely overwrought for no purpose whatsoever.

I love economic games and I love Martin Wallace games, so this was a recipe for success in my book.  I really enjoyed this game, and liked how the flow of the game was actually pretty intuitive.  Some Wallace games tend to be kind of crazy with odd rules that take some memorization and getting used to, but Automobile is very streamlined.  

The choices are all very tough, especially when it comes down to how many vehicles to produce, since hitting the demand dead on is important!  Just a very tight game which leaves players with little room for error.  Good stuff!

Enjoyable game with some interesting mechanics.  Do not play this game with someone with AP, however.  I think this would ruin the game.  It is longer and a bit of a brain burner, and one I would play again with the right group of people.

The demand can be frustrating, as you have to be fairly aggressive producing if you want to win and the person who benefits the most from the draws seems to often win among experienced players. Lowered to a 7.

This game made me realize that, although I'm a huge eurogamer, I just don't care that much for economic games. Basically I find them to be dry and frankly outright boring. I loooove eurogames, but these economic games are simply not any fun. At all.

Now, I have only played this game once, so take my comment with a grain of salt. We were all new to this, and we played suboptimally (for instance, one player sold a cheap car factory after the second round, right before the demand for cheap cars went up, and there weren't many factories for those cars in the first place...) Also, we played very carefully, so almost all of our produced cars went on to be sold. So I admit that we were all playing poorly, but I don't want to spend two hours playing this again when I can easily manage a play of my favorite or second-favorite game in that time (Agricola and Terra Mystica). Time is just too precious to play a game I don't like. Even though we played poorly, it seems we played equally bad as three of the four players ended within $100 of each other! So the game seems quite tight, but I'm always a little disappointed when the game requires you to take a loan in order to do well (the only player who didn't take a loan ended up $500 behind the rest). Oh, and I'd like to stress that I don't agree with the complaint that the demand tiles are too random; rather, I'd say that they have minimal impact. And even though you have, for instance, a 2 and a 3, you don't really have much information as the other players will likely have higher tiles; it seemed that the outcome was the average most of the times.

Tight, tight, tight.  Everything about this game is tight.  A well designed game that goes from point A to point B to point C with exact precision, but without being predictable.  Choices that you make at the begining of each round are so very important to determining your course of action later in the round.

This game is also a brain-burner.  Lots of thinking and planning going on.  There is also a great level of player screwage - not enough to make your opponent hate you and never want to play again, but just enough to gain those few extra points that you need to win the game.

An excellent MW design, and probably one of my favorites.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
A very good Wallace game. This one definitely wears you out after playing it, kind of like Age of Steam.  Quite a heavy brain burner - but there is a lot fun in the mechanics.  There is a race to build better cars, but only because the better cars have first dibs in the marketplace. If your car factories become too obsolete, then you are forced to pay a lot in losses or forced into closing it down.  And trying to find ways to expand and shrink your company, all while also trying to find ways to get into the market demand is quite a challenge considering your limited number of actions.  Add in a special roles phase and a special power phase (executive decisions) and it all balances nicely into a thoroughly engaging game.

I think I must be getting harsh in my old age because my rating of 7 is on the lower side of average. This is a clever and quirky design, as many of Wallaces often are, but a little on the dry side. You can't help but admire the mechanics, all the while thinking this ought to be more fun than it actually is. A good game that will improve with understanding, I think this will upgrade in the future. Clever and complex but with that element of chance that makes a game even better.

:sugar: :( :( :) :) :D 

UPDATE 9/15: Automobile is a fine game for four, but with five it really sings, to such an extent that playing with fewer players feels like a missed opportunity. When the number of players is maxed out, you really get an interesting diversity of strategies in place, and real tension in the role selection and executive decision phases. If the game felt excessively procedural/on rails when you've played in the past with 3 or 4 players, do yourself a favor and try it with the maximum player count.

---

A great, underrated game. Sort of a combination of Brass without a map and 18xx boiled down to the train rush. Like many of my favorite games (Brass, Le Havre, etc), you must build the latest and greatest technologies to win, but the very act of your building opens up new opportunities for your fellow players. Definitely better as a game with more than three as the three player game (in my limited experience) tends to lead to players focusing on a single market segment. Downside of more players is that you have even less information about demand than you do in the three player game. Accustomed as I am to games of business implying perfect information (or near enough to same), the randomness of the demand tile draws irks a little [i]but[/i] there are ways for the conservative player to mitigate the impact of randomness and, well, sometimes, you have to throw caution to the wind and say "who dares wins."

I'm not usually a fan of pure economic exercises but the theme here is so well integrated that I quite enjoy myself. This is a quick, tight game wherein every moment matters, yet I rarely feel stress, possibly because of the way those decisions flow across a game turn. Everything just makes sense to me in this system. A rewarding two-player experience is very possible thanks to the variations proposed here on the Geek!

I'm a big fan of all the Treefrog stuff so far.  Automobile is a fun and somewhat opaque (strategy-wise) economic game with some elements of Steel Driver, Brass and Tinner's Trail. 

It has a feel all its own. There is no obvious winning strategy. Seems like multiple things could be profitable, and could lead to victory.

Its not clear to me how much of strategy needs to be planned....and how much each action is a tactical choice based on what other players do. Feels about like Steel Driver in that regard. What is clear is that you can do a lot to affect other players....and it gives you a lot to think about with each move.

This is one that I think could go up in rating...and I look forward to more plays. I'm very glad I own a copy.

From 1 play: I see why certain types of people like this game, and there are those type of people in my game group, but I'm not that type of person. Way too mathy. Feels like work. Pace seems exceedingly plodding. Every round you have three actions, and pretty much it's Build Factory, Add Salesmen, and Produce most rounds. As for which factory to build, you usually have a choice of about two. I didn't see any plays that seemed clever or particularly interesting, nor can I imagine any.

I'm not sure how I feel about this game after the first attempt. We were up and running moderately quickly, which for Wallace titles is saying something; the fact that there were no Brass-like rules exceptions all over the place helped considerably. The game has a good feel of gearing up, maintaining the status quo and then preparing for the end. And with the exception of two small quibbles the 999 Games-edition was looking gorgeous. But there were cons too: the game is 'mathy' (which I don't mind, but do not particularly enjoy either), and it is bordering on the edge of my tolerability for player chaos owing to a substantial lack of random influences as well as tolerability for freedom of choice owing to a lack of options for the last player in the turn order. Turn order is important at certain moments in the game but not in others, thus making it difficult to decide whether to play for turn order on a given moment. You can probably get away with one or two hiatuses in your action flow, but certainly not more. Finally the market demand, which is decided by random tile draw feels at odds with the precise clockwork nature of the rest of the game. Yes, it constitutes a random factor, but it is a factor you have little hope of negating if you guess wrong.

I would certainly not be opposed to playing the game anew, possibly even several times, but at the same time I'm not convinced the game would click sufficiently to make it last. I guess the word I'm looking for is 'indifference'.

[b]Update[/b] Second play, feelings remain quite similar.

This is a very dense game of building an economic engine, following market trends, and carefully managing your cash flow.  It is the most complex game I think I've learned since Vinhos, but like that game, once you get a grip on the rules, it starts to all flow together.  What will take time is trying to get a grip on a real strategy.  With so many choices, it's hard to see a clear path right away.

Players set up factories to produce cars in 3 different market segments, then produce those cars and attempt to sell them - either through salesmen or through market demand.  Staying behind the current technological trends or not selling your cars will cost you - and those costs add up over time.

I definitely like this game - and I think with time I might even love it.  But I need more plays to figure that out.

Played at BGG.Con.  Admittedly, by this time I was no longer drunk, but hung over. 

Very interesting economic game of the history of the early years of the automotive industry. I really quite liked how the game modelled two different marketing approaches- either go for perceived 'quality', and go for high end cars, but small amounts of them. Or you could just go 'Mass Market' and try and flood the market with your cheaper cars.  But if you do that, you have to be able to get them to the market, with dealers, price incentives, and the like.

Very good game. I'm not a big Martin Wallace fan, but I really enjoyed this game and I've been trying to score a copy of this to play again.  Perhaps after a game without being hungover, I'll raise my rating of it.

I really want to like this game. I love the designer, the theme, the aesthetics, and even, for the most part, the game play. But every time I've played the game seems to hinge on who made a lucky guess on demand. It really is a guess--there's very little to tell you what to expect other than averages. But if you play the average you will likely lose to someone who made a mistake and produced too much but got lucky due to a surge in demand that they couldn't have guessed was going to happen. Frustrating.

Se trata de un juego en el que el tema está perfectamente integrado en las mecánicas, sencillo de jugar, matemático hasta el extremo y donde, quizá, dependes de las decisiones de los demás más que de las propias, y este es quizá el debe principal del juego, ganar o perder está muy poco en tus manos y mucho en las manos de los demás.

Probably the cleanest ruleset of the heavier Martin Wallace games. I like how this game gives players the opportunity to decide things that an auto executive might decide, such as what kind of cars to produce, how many, when to close factories, and how to use distributors. Some people might not like the unknown information of demand, but I like that players must take on some risk of loss in order to maximize sales. 

Can get fiddly with all the cars and factories on the board, and mathy when trying to figure out potential demand and how many cars one should produce. Really good for a business simulation game with a lot of player interaction.

Very tight economic game that oozes in theme.  All decisions are very important, but there is limited player interaction (trying to improve your chances of sales [distribution, marketing, etc] so that opponents may miss out).  I found it easier to teach than I expected.

Another good effort by Martin Wallace. Its a rare game of his I don't like. After several games, I;m feeling a little trapped in a one-goal strategy with this (dominate the cheap cars for the end game), but thats probably our group-think. And anyway, as usual this is balanced by how much do you want to pay to start building those cars compared to everyone else? There's nearly always a turn of massive over production in our games too, but thats part of the fun. :-)
Good stuff.

So close to being a good game. Interesting economy where you have to manage the tradeoff between production and managing the burden of older factories.

But the fact that the demand each round is random kills this for me. All your planning is for naught.

As the rating suggests, I likely won't play this again, but in theory could be talked into it.  I recognize that it's a fine game, it's just not for me.  I did not find it interesting enough to warrant all the calculating neccesary, nor did I find that fun.  Additionally, the random factor of the demand tiles and the fact that other people's choices weigh very heavily on the results of any round mean a player has ultimately very little control.

A clever game which does capture the theme quite well. I suspect it's quite hard to recover from a bad start but the game has a relatively short playing time for something which poses as many difficult decisions, so that is not necessarily a deal breaker. It's just a little dull and panders mainly to the accountants. 

Not one of my favourite Treefrog games but not bad.

Rating after two 4-player games. 

An excellent medium-heavy economic game. Tense, tense decisions. Excellent choices in the economic model.

A bit of math to determine demand/supply balance but we kept track of production with markers so that everyone didn't have to keep recalculating on their own.

Rating should go up to 8.5 if it plays well over the long run.

Want to play again.

What was initially an 8.75 for me is now a 7.5. This has not stood the test of time. Decisions that were initially engaging and interesting have become uninteresting and trite over the last two plays. Every play feels the same as the plays before it.

First game was with 5 players, way way to long. Fiddly. Will play this with 3 players next time and see if the fun can shine through. Too much work this time around.

Update: Second game was with 3 players. A little too much freedom this time, and I think 4 players might be the sweet spot. I really enjoyed it. I got rid of the Mayfair version and found an original. Alot easier to "see" whats happening on the board. The Mayfair version is much too busy for me. This one is definitely a keeper.

Raucous fun.  For a Martin Wallace economic spreadsheet game, the amount of table gasps and wails is amazing.  The game forces you to make important investment decisions based on a limited piece of market demand knowledge.  When you see opponents build cars that might kill the market in which you invested, you'll groan.  When you first see the true demand and realize who's making bank and who's liquidating stock, you'll laugh with joy or pain as the situation warrants.

RATING: 8
I could see this going up to a 9 with more plays.  It does a good job of making you balance the drive to get more out of your factory while pushing you to close up older model factories.  I'm a little worried about one of the automobile factory spots.  It might be too valuable...as there is not another spot to obsolete it within realistic reach.  Look forward to playing it again.

Finally have gotten to play this a couple more times.  I think this one remain at 8.  I can't rank it much higher as I think replayability is a little low.  The strategy seems to be heavily towards *hoping* no one gets in your way.  Also, spreading out with one factory to as many spots seems to be a good strategy to allow easier selling and sending black cubes to opponents.

Seems very hit or miss with the tension with a relatively small amount of meaningful decisions or strategy over the course of the game. I wanted to play it some more in order to get a feel for how much I liked it, but was eventually given an offer I could not refuse. I do not miss it, and am perfectly fine not playing it again.

RATING: 4
Players are automobile entrepreneurs in early America.  Players over four turns spend actions to construct factories, build cars and invest in research and development.  All this costs money, and you hopefully turn a profit by selling all your cars by the end of the turn.  Unsold cars, unused dealers, and redundant factories incur loss points, which equates to an escalating cash penalty.  Most cash at the end of four turns wins.  I've come to the conclusion that while I admire Martin's designs, and are happy to try them once, I seldom need to go through the effort of playing them again (this pretty much goes back to Stockers!) - Steam and Steel Driver are the exceptions.  Automobile joins that stack of games.  It's probably good, I enjoyed my one playing of it, pressing all the game mechanic buttons and levers, but ultimately it was just a business game of wooden bits, dressed up with some illustrations of cars and people.  Take that away and it was all pretty dry stuff.  I also got the impression it came down to "guessing" how many cars you could sell each turn, surrounded by lots of mechanical fluff.  Great if you want a meaty business game, otherwise be careful.

RATING: 5
A decent economic game, but the penalty for being wrong on predicting the demand, even by a few points, feels too big given how random the demand is.  The choice of how much to produce also reminds me of the sacrifice in Amun-Re, which I find kind of annoying, except at least here it's not simultaneous so if you're going last you know what to expect.  But it seems too dependent on group-think.  Or something.  I might like it better with fewer than five players, maybe.

I have a fondness for economic games, and to my mind this is one of the best.  The mechanics all make sense, the theme is extremely strong, and the game doesn't overstay its welcome.  It rewards multiple plays by revealing deeper and deeper strategies, and it is beautiful on the table.  To my mind, this is Martin Wallace's best design, and that's saying a lot.

RATING: 8
Classic Wallace, with a simple ruleset but complex interaction. During your first game, you might not grasp clearly what every one of your limited action have as an impact, but it will leave you thinking back on the game and seeing how you could have improved your score.
At first, there doesn't seem to be much interaction between player or occasions to pull a dirty trick on another player, but that's not the case. it can easily become a very cutthroat game.
Love it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Yet another improvement in Wallace's long line of great competitive economic games. Jockey for position in newer and newer models of cars, each newer plant you create nails the owners of older plants with more and more penalties. How to assure your cars get sold, and how to make a profit, are rough in this challenging economic game.

One factor that sets this one apart from many other are the vast number of incremental, meaningful decisions. A game like 1830 has lots of turns but a handful of hugely important, brittle events. This game has many more decisions that are all meaningful, and in sum add up to your progress yet one decision rarely sinks you. Thus, a single mistake will rarely cost you a game of misery. 

Highly recommended, if this sort of agressive economic game appeals to you!

After one play I've put it on my wishlist immediately.
Nothing have changed after second play, exept that I had bought it.

Maybe it has too big random/chaos factor as for a heavy game, but somehow it ok for me, now. Its more like kingmaking problem, than randomness itself.

Theme is nice and good handled by game mechanics, witch makes this more heavy game, possible to play with not so heavy players.

A lot of brain power needed here and perhaps one aspect of the game is a little too random.  I like it in Wallace simulation style, though I do prefer some of his other titles.

typical wallace - a good economic brain burner flawed by underdevelopment in a few areas. like so many of his games - it might be better to wait for iteration 2.... but the totally random demand mechanic nearly ruins what would be an otherwise good game... i suspect some additional play testing could have yielded a better system then a 'blind' chit draw. as a result it becomes a game with a veneer of deep thought that is likely decided by pure luck on the last turn.

I tried to play this with one group about 1-2 years ago but we had to discontinue playing when we were about at halfway of first round because those people thought that game was too dry and suffered about lack of interaction. So the game box was left to my shelf, gathering dust... but then came the day I ended up to play the whole game, finally.

I'd really have wanted to like more about this game because it looks so great but there are some issues... maybe too much mathy for me although most of it is quite easy multiplication and subtraction. I was still positively surprised about the game - it was not so dry and tedious I was anticipated it to be. This game needs some more plays before I can tell my final opinion about it. Maybe I will raise my rating after some plays.

About the versions: I think that the game board is better and looks more logical in the general market version of the game. Treefrog game board has some nice retro vibes but I would like to add some visual adjustments to it. They've worked out those adjustments to the new version of board and I must say I like more about that new board. It's way more usable!
Wooden pieces are gorgeous in Treefrog edition, though. But I like the paper money better, it's more comfortable to use. 
And there are neat pictures in those banknotes, too...

Wallace's borderline-heavy game of automotive production is an interesting, well designed game. It's a little on the heavy and long side for me, but I still found the game to be pretty enjoyable. I walked away from the table feeling a little constricted though, as the game doesn't have quite the diversity of paths to victory as we've become accustomed to in euro games. That may not be a good or bad thing, but it did give the game a slight repetitive feel.

Wallace game, weight of 3.5.  Not as heavy as Brass but certainly a step up from Tinners' Trail. 

Warfrog #5.  A 3-5 player game that bears a modern setting when compared to most of Wallace’s releases. Players are competing in the U.S. auto industry in the early 20th century, purchasing factories that turn out low-, medium- and high-valued vehicles, starting with the 1893 Duryea and moving up the time-line from there.

I'm a big Martin Wallace fan in general, so it pains me that I don't like this one. I've only played once but every now and then I check out the game's page again to see if perhaps my opinion of it should change. Every time I come to the same conclusion: it's just not that interesting of a game. The few decisions that you have are made or broken by how well you guess at the demand each turn (after a lot of calculator keypad mashing). Push your luck and win, and it's a great day for you. Hold back a little bit, and you did OK but lost out on a major opportunity that may not come again this game. But it's all guesswork in any case.

Seems that deciding which car line to produce and which bonus power to take each turn are the interesting aspects of the game, but the rest is AP-inducing number crunching and guesswork. I've heard that the game is best played by people not afraid to gamble and lose, but it's too long and otherwise too strategic of an endeavor for the game to hinge on that type of venture.

Automobile has a very interesting interplay of balancing different needs in a very constrained time frame.

Nevertheless, Automobile is another brilliant and engaging offering from this prolific designer.

(3-5 players) Uhhhh...I bought this based on a comment that said we should enjoy this if we were disappointed by Tinner's Trail being too loose of a game. Played one game and feel like it's WAY more complicated but ultimately is just as loose. In a four player game, demand was never a problem and no one was particularly compelled to exercise Executive Decisions. Everyone did pretty much as you would expect with their 3 actions each round: build factory, produce cars, place distributors. WTF else would you be doing? It just feels like a mess without any tension. I think I'm done with Wallace games for a while. The Treefrog games seem cool (and you want them to be cool) but they're just not delivering.

Update: After reading some more, it seems like this game only clicks if everyone is going all out on production, thus making demand scarce and making executive decisions for selling cars more compelling. I can't think of any other game that requires *everyone* in the game to play a very particular way for core game mechanics (and interesting game play) to kick in. What a ridiculous design.

Excellent translation of the automobile industry into a game.  It really conveys the theme well.  I don't know why, but it just doesn't intrigue me.  Once you're in the round, the decisions really bore me.  Instead, I think the real decisions of this game are positioning in turn order to get proper positioning on the board.  This is a really difficult process, though, and one I don't know is necessarily worth the effort.  It feels entirely tactical.  This shouldn't be a problem since I love Container and it is the same way, but for some reason manipulating the players is really fun there.

I really wanted to LOVE Automobile, being a pretty big Martin Wallace fan (especially of Brass, Liberte, Age of Steam, and Perikles).  But in the end, I only like it.  I’m not a huge fan of economic games, but this is a good one within that genre.  With only 12 “actions” each player can take within the whole game, it’s hard to see how this could take about 3 hours to play with 4 players, but that’s what happened in our first game.  As many others have said, it’s very mathy, to the point that it should really come with a calculator for each player. I was surprised at  how scripted it felt to me, as it doesn’t give me the sense that there are as many options as there should be for a gamer’s game with this esteemed reputation.  But I freely acknowledge that the strategy is probably a lot deeper and more subtle than first made itself apparent to me.  I like the theme and it gave me and my children some good motivation to do some research on the famous men featured in the game. My kids enjoyed this significantly more than I did, and I’m sure I’ll be indulging them with another play soon.

This one could be very "mechanic" but the rules mesh together perfectly to create a game that is best played "intuitively". You have to get a feel for what the market needs and invest there. This game also plays very quickly and has a lot of depth... You definitely feel like you are getting better every time you try it. The biggest drawback may be that you are at the mercy of a player doing a stupid investment and flooding the market in your area while another player has a golden road to success... But its a minor quibble, and most of the time you feel like you have your destiny in hands. This may raise to a 10.

Pretty tight economic game. When compared with Brass, the number of options available (and thus also the number of special rules and exceptions) has been trimmed down a lot, making Automobile a much more streamlined and polished experience. Even the few actions available allow for very meaningful (and excruciating) decisions but I'm wondering if the replayability might suffer a bit as a result.

Update: Actually, it turns out the game's most grating issue is not so much replayability as it is incalculable demand. You just can't make a properly informed decision when deciding how much to produce. If you play conservatively and produce few cars you just invite others to overproduce and get away with it. If you overproduce yourself you might just get lucky or, assuming the other players don't let themselves be scared away, everyone will suffer. In any case it feels like the winner is not determined by skillful play but by guessing the demand most accurately. Downgrading to a 6.

This is my lowest rated Martin Wallace game. It involves so much mental math my friends and I had to get out a calculator by the end of the game. Why would he do this to us?

I love how players position themselves along the track and invest in that position by building more than one factory there or a parts factory. I love how cars are sold, around the track but divided by the different markets, and how advertising and discounts can change the rate at which you sell. The salesmen are a little weird, but in the end I love that mechanic too.

I just won't be able to bring it to the table unless everyone in my gaming group is well rested, well fed, and ready to revisit their times tables from elementary school.

Automobile is an economic game with little hidden information. If you wanted to take the time, you could calculate the expected profit of each action. While you don't know exactly how much demand there will be, or who (if anyone) will advertise, you could take each possibility into account, along with its probabilty, and get a range of expected values. 

I didn't want to slow the game down by doing these calculations, nor did I enjoy playing sub-optimally, so this isn't really a game (or even a class of games) that I'll go out of my way to play again. There's nothing wrong with Automobile as an economic game, it's simply not my cup of tea.

Hrrrmph, not sure about the fun factor in this. Generally enjoyable, but not knee-slappingly joyous gaming.Think beard-stroking pauses and lots of paper money transactions.
Lacks the financial tension of AoS. 
Only 4 rounds making every decision crucial. Having said that though, the first 2 rounds feel like a build-up period for the 2nd half of the game.

I didn't know what all the fuss was about Martin Wallace here on BGG until I played Automobile. Now I know why so many people like his games. This is by far one of the best economic/business boardgames ever made. I especially like how the game forces you to continually catch up with technology curve.

Maybe this is a little too harsh a rating, as it is one of Wallace's more streamlined offerings but the overall impression after my first outing is of a game that is inoffensive yet terribly average.  

Automobile is stripped down to the essential mechanics (unlike most of Wallace's offerings), and they all mesh together well creating smooth gameplay, however there really doesn't seem to be much in the way of decision making here.  There also lacks any twist, so play feels repetitive and limited. 

There are only twelve actions in the game, 4 of which are going to be production.  This leaves 8 actions to each player, of which you have three choices - take a couple research cubes, place 1-3 distributors, or buy/close a factory.  Chances are players will spend one turn each round buying a factory.  So we are now at 4 actions.

Buying factories is not really too difficult a decision.  You buy the best you can in which ever market you perceive to be most beneficial.  I don't see any dilemma ever presenting itself here.

And this is where my issue with Automobile lies.  The decisions are all fairly obvious, and bend around the unknown demand of each vehicle.  So players guess, and most of the time play conservatively as the penalty for risk is often way too overwhelming to warrant attempting. THe only true decisions seem to come from choosing a role at the beginning of each round, as there powers timed right seem to really make the difference.

---the following is an opinion in the working---

I will go out on a limb and really stretch my point of view and say Automobile feels like Galaxy Trucker to me in a way. Not in mechanics persay, but in the result of how the model of play in each game is set up.

In both games you make a couple decisions to set up your turn, and then you let the fate of industry take it's course.  Both games offer small decisions upfront, and bottom load the second half of each play round with maintenance.  After the dust settles you see where you sit for the following round and repeat.  

Yes the decision tree is vastly different, but the scope of play feels the same.  In Galaxy trucker you can get a sense of disasters arising on the horizon from sneaking a peak at cards, while in Automobile you have a single demand tile. You then set up your business (or ship) to deal with the storm ahead.

With a game this seemingly light I prefer the spatial elements and not to seriousness of Galaxy Trucker.

Love the game. My bother-in-law and I had a Business Strategies class simulation in college that was basically this game except we sold computer chips instead of cars.  Key is to estimate how many cars you can sell given the market demand.  Rules are intuitive and makes for a good weight game that isn't burdened by having to search the rule book.

Update: I've evolved to the point where I'm willing to own a game like Automobile.

Brain-burning dry economic calculation game.  You only get 12 main actions, 3 per turn (in this regard reminds me of Princes of Florence).  Each turn you are going to produce cars, and probably build factory/s, so that is only 1 action each turn free to vary strategy.  But is all about micro-calculations about how many cars you are going to be able to sell.  Very clever design - lots of complexity for a relatively straightforward system.  first game was challenging, looking forward to more to get to grips with the system.  Around Power Grid in weight - not as complex as Brass.

A decent enough game with some interesting decisions, but I find myself wishing that I was playing Lokomotive Werks instead.  There's a bit too many moving parts that detract from the fun of trying to desperately stay ahead of obsolescence.  And why do my unsold cars spoil?  Do they lose their new-car smell?  Meh.

Generally, I shy away from games that too mathy. Something about this one though really impresses me. I love the transitory nature of coming out with a new car model, debating what how many to produce and then decide whether to keep the factory for the next turn. I think I will never be good at this game, but even so, I love it.

Strong theme, easy rules with room for tactics and strategic options, some bluffing and screwage among players  and it also has a very good dosis of interaction. It is a game about producing and selling according to demand, so expect to do many additions and subtractions in order to find out the correct amount of producion. Thus, it is quite AP prone and I dont enjoy to play it with very mathematical players nor slow ones. But if players accept the risks of offer and demand taking decisions fluently and acepting some minor risks it is a delicious game experience. I dont agree with the critics on this one, the only grip is the scripted first turn (factory-cars and then may be sellers, may be another factory), but the rest of the game offers a lot of different paths to the gamers.

I'll take the seemingly contrary view and say I prefer Ships to Automobile. The two games have a somewhat similar upgrade mechanic and  out-of-date loss mechanic. But that's more or less where the comparisons stop. The meat of the game comes in guessing demand as well as meeting that demand before your opponents do while also forcing them to take losses for overproducing. It's a fine rope to walk and one that makes for a really fascinating gaming experience. For better or worse, turn order is crucial in this game.

-Good interaction & tough decisions
-Relatively short playing time and straightforward rules

-Ugly as sin

Personal: economic game about making and selling cars. I have the impression that I make the same each play I do, but when the game is finished not all was the same. You have to prepare your industry to produce cars, prepare your sellers to do so and take the demand into account as not everybody will want a car. The interaction between players makes the game brutal, which factory to build, where to produce cars and how many, should I send my distributors, turn order or that character I need so much? Many things going on

Mostly positive impressions, but I worry that the choices may be a little too constrained, or even scripted.  There's not a very broad array of "things to do" here.  I'm curious to see how much variation there will be from game to game, because the design itself provides very little intrinsic variation.  After the Flood had the same problem, leading to a loss of interest after a few plays.  Most games need a little randomness in the initial setup in order to stay fresh.

From the look and feel of it, I would say that this is a typical Wallace design, even though I haven’t played many of his games. There is a lot of counting and optimizing and you constantly feel you are getting a little behind and have to struggle to come in front. I appreciate the design, which feels pretty thematic, but I can’t say that I think this is the most fun game he has made. Maybe I had higher hopes for this game, but I think it’s a pretty dry design and not really for me. It was an interesting experience and one I think will get better with more plays, but right now I am wondering if I want to take the time to explore it.

5th game played as part of my experience of the Great Canadian Board Game Blitz in Ottawa.  By the time this hit the table, I was feeling a little gamed out, and having just finished an excellent game of Goa, this one didn't stand a chance.  I could tell as the game was being explained to us, my opponents were feeling much in much the same.  The one player on my left (playing yellow) showed such disdain that he started asking if he could just pass as his first action...?  I suggested a move for him and he just did what I suggested.  The rest of the game continued in a similar fashion, where after I'd made some weak and/or terrible decisions for myself, I'd have a great suggestion for the yellow player and he'd capitalize on it.  He ended up winning and I came in dead dead last.  Funny how sometimes seeing an opponent's optimal strategy is easier than figuring out your own.  Maybe I'll just keep my mouth shut next time...
If I do get to play this one again, I think I'll enjoy it a lot more.

A very good economic game with a variety of mechanisms to simulate the competition in car sales and how new models take over from older model cars, eventually phasing them out.
I could have rated higher, but I think the learning curve for the mechanics and strategies is a bit steep for casual gamers and reduces the ability to bring it to the table.
Still good to have a game like this in one's collection for when veteran gamers are available and looking for a challenge.

17th June 2009: Played it once so far. Gave myself almost a week to think the game over and get rid of "cult of the new" syndrome. 8.5 is a fair note though I expect to move it up a bit when I get to play more.

The game itself - while wonderfully designed with all thing working together like a Swiss watch - is even more thematic than Brass which used to hold - till I played Automobile - the lead in terms of being most ambient among euro-games.

And Martin Wallace is the king.

While there are exceptions, I tend to not enjoy economic games.  I usually find them to be dry, too calculating, and just too much work.  While there is a fair amount of calculations necessary in Automobile, I find these to be exciting, and they have an often dynamic result on the game.  The swings of fortunate can be dramatic, with a slight over-or-under estimation in production spelling the difference between victory and defeat.  Tough decisions must be made throughout the entire game, and there appears to be a wide variety of strategies players can pursue.  This is a rich game that will challenge players game after game.  Sadly, if a player’s automobile company falters, there is no government bailout available.  Perhaps that will be an option in a future expansion!

As someone who is averse to economic games, I loved this one, which was a very big surprise. After my first (5-player) I was itching to play it again, which stunned my gaming group.  It's a tremendous game. 

For the economic-game phobic, Automobile blends mechanics with such elegance and maintains such a taut and steady conflict/tension among the players, that this game transcends being "just" an economic game, if that makes sense. 

The true goal is to stay as efficient as possible with your resources - which so happen to be "money." It challenges players to choose the perfect moments to zig when others zag, and to take financial risks. The gaming experience is hot-blooded and visceral - this game is NOT a cold calculator or adding machine experience at all, which is why it shines for me (and why I usually dislike economic games).

Automobile distills and streamlines the economic game experience - and encloses it in an excellent, intuitive, and evocative theme so it's never dry and one is never too far asea with mere math, or rote spending and buying. 

I highly recommend this to someone who dislikes traditional financial/economic games where the object is to make the most money, because you'll find Automobile a revelation. Having the most $$$ is the object, but this game is, thankfully, NOT Acquire or Monopoly.

Initially, the board and multiple steps make the rules feel difficult to play, but playing through a turn they become completely intuitive. Very few actions during the game makes each one important, other players choices influence what options/strategies are available as you build around the development track. Turn order variable and interestingly so - benefits to both ends of the track dependent on your position. The game is very financially minded, and working out expected profit from actions is important. The tile draw is a red herring though, as it really doesn't give you enough information to be relevant. Other than that as fine a game as I could have hoped. Not Brass, but then that wasn't what I was looking for. Our group will only call the cars Beep-Beeples.

Very mathy, AP prone, with needless complexity.  Guessing how many cars you will be able to sell is pretty interesting, but other than that and a couple of other things it is pretty bland.  Not that much decision making for a two hour game.  You get three actions, your character, and the executive decision, four times over the four turns- not that enthralling for how long it is.  The theme is pasted on and could be any market you want.  Total disappointment from what I expected to be a very cool game.

RATING: 6.5
After my first play, I liked this game.  The final scores are high (in the $4000-$5000 range), so it's hard to figure out where all that money comes from, especially since you only have 12 actions during the game!  (Well, other than special actions tied to your investor.)

But there is one key point: you lose $100 for each factory (including tools factory) that you close down.  So you might just want to keep them around for a while.  On the other hand, you really don't want to collect lots of black cubes for old factories, even though your remaining factories at the end of the game are worth full points (no $100 penalty).  It's a tricky balance, especially since you don't know how the demand for cars is going to be allocated each turn.  In the last turn, having just enough distributors and the "sell 2 cars of your choice" investor is a good thing to help balance the randomness of the demand tiles -- you can use them to sell old cars from the factories at the end that might not ever get sold.

This game does need computerization -- it's hard to figure out exactly what combination of cars you can buy and sell with your current funds, and it's even harder to figure out how many factories to build on the right squares to leave you with enough funds to buy the range of cars required by that number of factories...

Great game, up there with the very best from Wallace. The game is not very complicated, and the rule book is excellent. Certain aspects (such as discounts, marketing, etc) are hard to explain, but after running through a round or two, everything makes perfect sense 

Lot of interaction between the players, as the number/type of car models produced by the other players have an impact on the market. This makes it necessary to constantly make adjustments and even change strategy. 

Very solid game, will play any time. I have replaced the cardboard car tokens With wooden cars, and the dealer tokens have been replaced by meeples.

I imagine this is not a game I'll play that often because it is so mathy. I do enjoy it but have to be in just the right mood. The fact that you have SO few actions means that, almost from the beginning, it feels like time is extremely short. The game is usually extremely close with the outcome completely uncertain until the end. I find it very satisfying when I'm in the right mood. (Note: My first Wallace game)

Played with three players and we didn't get too far up on production models.  There are some interesting dynamics at work with the demand tiles and loss cubes, but I do wish the focus were more on making money rather than minimizing losses.  It can feel a little bit too much like gambling and that you don't have enough control of the situation.  I'd like to try it with more players, as I feel it would balance out better.

Debating Treefrog vs Phalanx editions... went Treefrog - one solo play, and I can tell it will be an absorbing game, but not how much fun it will be making descisions for myself with less secondary knowledge. 7.5 initial rating, with possible ups and/or downs based on reception.

Resource management game, with not quite enough actions per turn. Based on limited information, funds & resources, maximize profit, without overproducing (which is penalized). 

At the same time maintain current facilities, recognizing that closing a plant means taking a loss on face value to avoid penalties for obsolescence. Or choose a character who helps avoid these penalties, at a cost in turn placement/decision making order.

2nd play true 3-player, with Mom & Dad.  Still not getting all the strategy, but enough to win a teaching game anyway.

3rd play 4-player solo, and it seemed a little tighter.

4th play 5-player solo- Wow! That made a big difference!
The character selection seemed harder and tighter, the choice to advance forward for plants more reasonable and the decision to do so more difficult.  Everything seemed to tighten up, a lot.  Raising rating to 7.75

a typical martin Wallace design that evokes the feel that all his designs do in me, boredom. if you like wallace games you should play this, but you should probably play Lokomotive Werks which is a tighter game.

Great game.  The theme is excellent and the quality of the Mayfair reprint is good despite the use of cardboard tiles instead of wooden cars.  This is a moderately heavy economic game where you try to maximize the return on your investment (car factories) and get the most out of your actions.  There's a lot going on in this 4-turn game.

All I can say is: Wow. Another hit from Martin Wallace. It is almost as good as Brass, in a different sense where it effectively captures the entrepreneur spirit of the early age of automobile manufacturing. There's no mistaking the sense of evolution of the American consumers' taste, going from initial small volume, niche market cars for the middle-class, to the cheap, mass-produced cars for the masses. In the background, there's also the luxury cars of limited production and limited demand. You've got to figure out how to make the most money in trying to satisfy the almost unpredictable consumer demand, similar to the Voice of the People in La Citta.

The trademark Wallace turn-order manipulation mechanic is there, with elements of Age of Steam and Tinner's Trail mixed in. It plays like Lokomotive Werks (and distantly like Bootleggers), with the advances of technology constantly making older factories more expensive to operate, and eventually making them obsolete. Four turns, with twelve actions seems like it's not enough to accomplish everything, but then there are the historically famous automobile executives to help you along. There are also many nail-biting decisions on building and closing factories, developing and expanding your distribution network (you can literally see the rise and fall of your dealerships, as the salesmen move around the three tiers of luxury, near-luxury, and Economy levels), how many to build, advertising, and discounting, doing everything you can to move your inventory. Otherwise, the cost of obsolescence, excess inventory, interest on loans, and layoffs will eat your profits. Exciting all around. Can't wait to play it again! Initial rating: '9'.

Update (09/27/11): It seems that this game has peaked, as nobody wants to play it anymore. There seems to be a feel that the game has a very narrow range of game play with the 16 actions/4 turns. The demand tile(s) you can see don't give you the complete picture of demand, although you could try to apply statistics--you can't. Somehow, you must go with your "gut" feel, and tailor your play within the context of the other players. There are some interesting tactical choices within a very limited framework, and some strategy, but when far removed from the game, it seems more like gambling--a crap shoot. If your gut is right, you win; if your instincts are wrong, you lose. This is probably why people are disinterested. I still like it, but the narrow play seems to have turned people off. I'm dropping it from a '9' to an '8'.

Update (01/15/12): Wow. This game has had a very short half-life. No one wants to play this due to the very narrow variance of impact, based on the players' few choices. It seems like it is min/max optimization for a $10 gain here or there. I liken it to a multi-player chess match, where you really can't go wrong with most of your choices, but it really boils down to who makes the most of what seem trivial mistakes. Despite its inviting design, it looks unforgiving from that regard. Perhaps that is why people avoid this. Dropping to a '7'.

Update (05/20/12) 10 plays: It's refreshing to play this again with a new group and new dynamics. However, it seems if one is aggressive enough, amidst a group of timid players, it is entirely possible to run away with the game.

Update (12/29/12) 14 plays: played against some of my friends who are relentless min-maxers, where one of them won twice. In both situations, the situation looked hopeless where the min-maxer took two loans, and even took a $400 hit for inefficiency, and still won by a few hundred dollars. Looks like the game still has subtleties to discover. However, it is discouraging when both parties can't figure out why they won or lost.

RATING: 7
Generally, this is a game of inches... I get $100 up on you here, you get $60 up on me there... etc...  However, bad play can quickly turn this into miles.  What this means is that failure to act by a poor player can hand the game to someone else.  Player chaos is really turned up here, so this game is best appreciated when everyone knows what they are doing.

To consider the impact of your choices, you generally have to add up a large amount of figures.  This reminds me of Power Grid and is a bit of a turn-off for me.  Despite this, there is something intriguing about the ruthless efficiency that you aspire to in this game, and it maintains my interest for the time being.

RATING: 7
A game with more moving parts than a Swiss watch. Expect plenty of new player confusion as you explain all the possible actions and their likely effects, but things will become much clearer after a round or two. Much heavier than most Martin Wallace games and with just 3 actions per turn it's not going to vary much with repeat play. The demand tiles provide too little information for the game to become deterministic so you can win by sheer good fortune. As a business game I like the balance of risk and reward, but the game is serious vulnerable to too much thinking and then it can stretch to 3 hours+ and that's too much effort for too little payoff in my book.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
For me, this game just isn't very much fun. There are reasons for this: the theme doesn't engage me at all and I hate taking risks based on limited information, so I'm probably not the target audience here.  Much as I enjoy heavy economic games, Automobile for me is more stressful than fun. More detailed reflections below.

This game does an absolutely excellent job at inspiring a feeling of dread, if not outright terror.  In fact, I would go so far as to say it is the scariest game I have ever played. Arkham Horror has nothing on this. I guess this aspect of it is thematic...

It is very likely that, whatever you do, bad things will happen to your fledgling automobile company.  Your competitors will cause the customers to laugh at your cars.  You'll produce too many and find yourself deep in debt, or too few and fail to make any money. It is emphatically a game all about risk management, and as a rather risk averse person, I found it very stressful.  But it is a very clever game with a system that kept me thinking about our session for days, and I'll likely come back to it.  On the other hand, it is also a good explanation of why I would never, ever, ever want to be an entrepreneur in real life.  (3 plays)

I find this game rather unforgiving; (not necessarily a bad thing but that makes it harder for a non-gamer to succeed).   Watch out for playing with those subject to AP as such players will spend serious time calculating every detail to estimate number of cars that can potentially be sold.

A very deep game.  The obsolescence element is clever, but the intriguing balance in the way the factory track works is even more impressive.  A wide variety of strategies suggest themselves immediately -- produce a lot of older cheap, vehicles, produce a few of the newest thing, concentrate on distributors, concentrate on the economy cars.  There is a ton to explore.  Wallace thinks this is his best game.  I won't be surprised if he turns out to be right.

When first playing this game I've felt a touch of brilliance and genius by Wallace - similar feeling to that when playing Perikles or Brass.  This feeling has passed now, still it seems like another very solid game from Wallace.

Automobile reminds Power Grid in a sense that it's VERY mathy and reminds Perikles as well - in a sense that there are several elements here that interlock together extremely well.

This is a demanding game for yet another reason - one mistake at the beginning and you have no chance to win.  This is a gamers' game.
Generally, it's a game hard to master - very different gameplay each time and no schematic moves don't make the task easy for the players.

Only this terrible horrible graphics of the board (original edition)... :-/  New edition has its serious flaws too so the Warfrog edition is the best choice anyway.

EDIT: After 8 plays I have enough.  Yeah, there is no one winning path, you have to improvise in each game and try to find the winning recipe anew, but the components (actions) feel repetitive after some time and I've exercised them enough already.

Sold.

RATING: 7.5
initial rating 1 play 3 players

Well I dont think it is the next "Grail" and definitely not Wallaces best game, just my opinion. I thought the theme was fantastic (wife didnt like it however and wanted "shoe" factories) and fit an economic game perfectly with most mechanics relating to theme. 

3 will be the weakest player number by a landslide, the game was NOT scaled properly at all and needs some simple tweaks IMO to play well with 3 unless we played wrong, it was not tight and some actions werent even that useful. I sat on a middle line factory all game and won, never building another pumping cars out like crazy. Yes some things could have been done to prevent it, but thats not the main point.  

Speaking of factories, it did seem strange to me that the luxury factories are somewhat harder to build but less profitable in the end as well. The low end were also less profitable so the middle line are the best to go after and should be the most fought after. I'm not sure about this element but it seemed a bit off to me, it seems it definitely HAS TO BE fought after or I dont see how the other players will compete since they will be less profitable. When fought after, chances are these middle line car producers will end up with some "loss" cubes to compensate for the extra profit being made but I'm not sure it will be enough, maybe. 

Also, as some others have mentioned, with limited options AND choices, the overall scope of strategy is potentially limited, looks to be midweight overall and maybe a touch long for that weight.  

I did actually like the game overlooking some things that were crappy with only 3 players but my rating is tentative (some benefit of the doubt given) until I play 4 or 5 which I know will be better and see how long the next game will take.  For example more factories will be built, which means the loss cubes become more important, building factories down the road more important,  characters which help get rid of loss cubes more important, game tighter overall, etc.    

Update - WAYYYYY better with 5 due to the scaling issue, how do things like this get through playtesting? Sure seems rules need tweaking for 3 players anyway, we had no issues with 5 like we did with 3.

You're making sixteen decisions over the course of two-plus hours (one character choice and three actions each round). And one of the actions *has* to be "Produce," and one of them is almost certainly going to be "buy a factory," so you're making 8-12 decisions over the course of two-plus hours. That coupled with the wild randomness of the demand tiles make this not at all my cup of tea.

I could immediately see bits and pieces of a few of Wallace's other games in Automobile but frankly, who cares?  There is a lot of decisions to make and every one of them matters. In fact, you'll be wishing you could do a few more than you're able to at times!  All in all another FANTASTIC game from Wallace ranking right up there with Brass in my book.

*UPDATE*  So after a half-dozen plays I still can't seem to wrap my head around this game.  I understand what I need to do I just can't seem to do it well enough to win.  Frankly, it's losing its luster for me.

Heavy and dry economic game. Interesting decisions boiled down into 12 actions. Quite fiddly too, though, with lots of shuffling bits back and forth. Some aspects of the game feel very thematic, while others introduce abstractions that I find it hard to wrap my head around (eg. R&D cubes, loss cubes, bonus sales discs).

Personally, I think I prefer Wallace's economic games where *geography* plays a role, eg. Brass or Age of Steam. Although intriguing in many ways, Automobile ends up feeling slightly too abstract and 'spreadsheety'.

I generally like Wallace games, so I had high hopes for the game. Sadly I was very disappointed. I feel the game is way too long for what it offers and has lots of downtime (the worst sin a game can commit). I played Automobile a long time ago so I don’t remember much about the game. My desire to play it is very low, but I want to give it another chance, with faster players.  When I do, I will come back and re comment.

After another play, I can say I enjoyed it a lot more so I’m upgrading its rating. You have many things to think and only 3 actions per round so you have to carefully manage your options. I really like that aspect of the game. It is not clear what your best play is, that is, the game seem to have very interesting decisions (should I open/close a factory?, How many cards should I build, Should I hire sellers?), but I’m afraid they will become obvious with more plays, after all, you NEED to build cards in each round so I’m not really sure if the game is obvious or not. 

The game components and art is good. I think this is best as enjoyed a 4 player game, with more the downtime begins to be very long.

On my dislikes, I found the card demand to be overly random, it can be (with 4 players) from 8 to 20 units for a car market and there is no way to know this ahead of time, so it is uncontrollable and here is when the game is defined. You can of course sell through sellers and Howard but still it is very random for my liking. In both my games the player who correctly guessed the demand won the game as he not only didn’t get any waste cubes, he also made money selling all his cars. If you guess wrong you will lose and it is a guess, not a deduction.

For now Automobile climbs up at a borderline 6.0, but I feel it will come down again with more plays. Automobile also needs some fast players or the game can be very boring.

RATING: 8
Has a lot of familiar Wallace motifs - player-driven turn order, low randomness, high borrowing costs, penalties for imprecise play.  However Automobile feels more forgiving than his other titles somehow.  Perhaps this is because the demand is so hard to target precisely that the hope always exists that even a competent owner will misjudge it, or even take a good gamble that backfires.  Or maybe it's because, unlike Age of Steam, incompetent play will probably still be profitable, just a lot less profitable than that of opponents.

Wallace's economic games tend to model supply and demand in straightforward and interesting ways, and I think Automobile is my favorite.  The supply-demand model is also the source of what some players I've played with have criticized about the game.  They say that the correct supply is difficult to target because multiplayer chaos drives the other players' supply.  My answer to that is to pick Chrysler and go last if you're concerned about chaos.  Then other players might still get in your way to produce optimally but you're less likely to take heavy losses due to someone else's bad play.  I appreciate that the randomness comes from the other players (as in Age of Steam) rather than a more arbitrary card mechanism as in Brass.  You can still do whatever you want in Automobile - the chaos effect determines how well it will work out but your action choices aren't randomly restricted.

Theme also is well integrated, up to the standards of previous titles like Brass.  Sure, one can imagine this game being about the birth of the aviation industry, or about diamond mining or something, but the automobile theme is rich and works well for this game.

Played a 3p and thought the game lacked a bit of the tension that I enjoyed so much in my first two 4p games.  That may have been due to my strategy though, as I went heavily into Autobuggies and National 40s, thus avoiding conflict (very profitably) for the first two turns.  It looks like 4 is definitely in this game's sweet spot - I wonder if 5 works or if it devolves into chaos.

Need to get this game to the table again.  I made a bad move in my last game and banished Automobile to the scrap heap for several months.

RATING: 8
Very simply - this game works, thematically and mechanically.  Each player starts with $2000 and he who can turn the most profit after 4 turns of selling cars is deemed the winner!  Simple and elegant.

This is not for the feint of heart as it is very mathy - think Age of Steam or Power Grid, but I prefer Automobile much more than both of those.

An argument can be made that it's a bit long (1.5-2.5 hours depending on experience of group) for what you do.  The heart of the game is that you only get 12 actions (and 4 of those are to produce cars).  Yes, choosing characters, assigning distributors, and executive decisions are also significant, but ultimately you get a measly 12 actions.

From start to finish the games I've played in have flown by smoothly.

Overall, Wallace created another keeper in my book!

This is going to take time to understand. It has a better

An interesting economic game where each player has twelve actions in which to make the most money. Once familiar with the game turns played fairly quickly, since with only three actions a round you really have to know what you are looking to accomplish.

RATING: 9
Wallace is at his most original with heavy economic games and I think this is one of his best. His games have developed over time a signature style, with players selecting limited variable actions in order to take best advantage of the mandatory (but not insignificant) decisions about how to make money or collect points. Economic games from most other designers of recent vintage almost invariably involve auctions as a central mechanic. While I love economic games I usually only tolerate the auctions they require, which is probably why Brass and Automobile - being economic games without auctions - really hit home with me. You must be brutally efficient in your choice of actions. With only 3 actions per turn, and one of those almost always being "Produce Cars", there is not a lot of room for error. The tension and doubt while playing is palpable.

Probablemente el mejor juego de 2009.

Wallace ha creado un gran juego en el que tratas de convertirte en el mejor constructor/vendedor de coches. Puedes construir fábricas donde puedes producir distintos modelos de coches. Estos coches están divididos en tres tipos: alto, medio y bajo. Una vez que tienes tus coches necesitas venderlos para ganar dinero... parece fácil pero no lo es.

Un juego muy duro pero muy bueno. Es un juego de Wallace por lo que si te quedas sin dinero siempre puedes pedir un crédito :)

Probably the best game of 2009.

Wallace created a great game where you try to become the best car builder/seller. You can build factories where you can produce different cars. These cars are ranked in three types: high, medium and low. Once you get your cars you need to sell them to earn money... it looks simple but it isn't.

Very hard game but very good one. It's a Wallace's game so if you run out of money you can always take a loan :) [/color]

RATING: 9
I think this is probably Wallace's best game and my favorite 2009 game thus far.  Played about 10 times with a handmade prototype (based on some detailed rules summaries posted here at BGG and on a prototype I saw at PrezCon).  Each game has developed differently, and while you don't have that many decisions to make, each one seems to be excruciating.  Do you open a new factory, risk losing money on an old one, which character to choose each turn, how many cars to produce, whether to spend cubes on double-sell actions or pass and play for turn order, etc.?  
  Update (June 2009):  Have tentatively assigned the game a rating of 9 and added it to my all-time Top Ten list.  Just received a pre-ordered copy direct from UK.  Again, the game has relatively simple mechanics but each turn there are important, gut-wrenching decisions to make.  The game also seems to fit the theme perfectly, something that's very important to my appreciation of a new game.

I have a confession, I have not played this game. I got it as I loved the theme, but I found the look and the rules did not excite me as much as I hoped. It was flavour of the month at my games club when it came out and got loads of plays. 

Maybe a new years resolution, I must try this game.

[b]New Comment[/b]

Automobile is a game I can't see playing more than 1-2 times a year, tops. Though I enjoy the "cut your losses" dynamic, the steep obsolescence of old factories and brands, and the necessity of finding the underserved markets, it just takes way too long to go through the motions. Maybe I've just forgotten what it's like to speed through this in 2 hours with 5 knowledgeable players - though I'm not sure I've ever had the luxury. But this always seems to take a full 3, and unlike some heavy games, this one is quite fragile in regards to pacing. The reason for this is that players are guessing against largely unknown demand and that small over/under errors have large consequences, and when it's all said and done no-one wants to invest three hours in that. Even 2 is questionable. There are so few decisions to make in this game, and many of them are scripted by type but require fine-tuning (timing, exact output) by the player. Unfortunately, this kind of decision-tuning is subject to the "need a new plan" syndrome of games like Tigris and Euphrates, but instead of needing a new plan, players need to recalculate several things simply to change their production output by one or two. It's cumbersome. 

Automobile is a clunky game. I'll give it credit for being different and for actually creating a narrative and sweeping players up in a thematic experience, but the pitfalls are numerous. It's all talk and no follow-through. 

[b]Old Comment[/b]

Automobile shows us just how much ambition Martin Wallace can channel into a game. You have numerous models to choose from. You may commit to full production of those models or do smaller, limited runs. You can diversify between three pricing tiers for your cars, or concentrate on one or two. You can market your models to increase your market share and inflict losses on your opponents. You can declare a "fire sale" to avoid looming losses. You can do a bit of R&D and then ramp up production on a newer, hotter, spiffier brand. You can sell extra models through distributors: just don't leave 'em empty handed or it's more losses. You can shutter obsolete factories to cut your mounting losses (whew!). You can take loans for cash flow and hope the extra production/profit offsets the interest.

Doesn't it sound like there's tons to do in this game? Too bad it's just the opposite. I can't deny that Automobile is an enjoyable experience with its own feel among economic games, but there is shockingly little to do. You have 12 core actions to take over 4 turns. 4 of these must go towards producing cars, so the decision is reduced to timing (when to produce during the turn?) and quantity (how many cars to produce?). At least 3 of these actions will be building factories, so the decision is once again reduced to timing and quantity, with R&D expenditure added in. I've played four times and made my peace with the nature of the game, but this will always compare unfavorably to any game that gives you lots of room to explore and act.

UPDATE: I think this is clearly a 5-player only game. The full board is only used with 5. It's just not nearly as interesting with fewer players. That clouded the initial reception of the game, as our group played a few times with three and four. The first 5P games were a revelation, but after that the game's shortcomings returned in force. It gets by on being different without being that strong, both in individual pieces and in sum total. Ultimately I'm not sure what this game needed to shine. Higher action count? More choices in the Executive decisions phase? More knowledge of demand? All three? I'm willing to play this now and then, but no longer interested in owning it.

This is a hard fought economic game.  Players build factories, speculate on demand, produce cars, and then fight with price and promotion to insure that their cars get sold.  The game can be brutal when you over produce.

There is some luck element in planning for the uncertain demand which many players don't like.  However, that luck element will affect many players - and who asked you to be so reckless in your production decisions?

Love this game. Not as heavy as Brass (which really made my head hurt).
Stikes the sweet spot of rules complexity and flavour with playability and theme. I 'got' the game almost immediately and was able to be very competative on my first go.

Looking forward to playing again this week.

**Update** I will always play this game if its available - I find it intuitive and easy to understand how the market works without really having to do any calculation. Really loving this game right now.

**Update** Prices are high so i'll trade this before the reprint hits. Replayability appears limited.

I Like:
* Great understandable mechanics - the game makes intrinsic sense and the mechanics back up the theme.
* This is a game where player interaction is indirect, but still present through playing the other players.

I Dislike:
*Don't play this game with slow / AP prone players. i taught it once to a new group and one player almost put me off the game with glacial play.

** Sold copy on BGG Market Place due to high prices being offered. Haven't missed it too much.

Repurchased July 2011 in a sale - Mayfair version.

Investment appraisal is the name of the game but investment appraisal has never been so much fun before. In the long run I could see this on a level with Power Grid for my personal enjoyment which means up to two or three plays a year. For players cranking out 10+ games each year it probably doesn't have enough variation with repeat plays. Out of the first three economic Treefrog titles (Tinner's Trail, Steel Driver, Automobile) this is the deepest and best after first play.

Probably pushes the economic game slightly over whatever arbitrary line of comfort I have.  I'd need to play more, as I was overwhelmed by not seeing obvious strats during my first play. Edit 10/9/09:  After play two, I have no major criticisms of this game about wringing marginal profits from an uncertain market.  However, it's got too much math for it to be my kind of game.

Take an economics game. Add variable player powers, some worker placement... all the best mechanics of many different games. Factories you build become obsolete, creating a constant need to upgrade. It's like Lokomotive Werks, but fun! Furthermore, analysis paralysis, the bane of economic games, is kept to a minimum through a light sprinkling of luck. Love it!

Tough to rate. This is essentially a business simulation (like Container or Dividends). Players build factories and produce cars to sell on the market.

The game is pretty simple, not many choices to make, but there is quite a bit of math involved in trying to see if you're making money. The game is extremely dry, not much theme and the components reflect that. Overall, it was okay, but not a game I would want to play very often.

Martin Wallace is usually right on the money with my tastes and this is no exception.  The theme is very well incorporated with the game and the very small amount of luck makes for an extremely tense decision when it comes time to produce cars.

Only played once but I unfortunately have mostly negative things to say about this game. Very unremarkable experience. Choices were often predictable. You have 3 choices per round and one of them almost always HAS to be producing cars (otherwise you earn $0 and give you opponents that much more opportunity to sell their cars without worry of overstock).  There is no competition for actions so you can do whatever you want, whenever you want. The choice order is really obvious and takes little strategy. The salesmen mechanic is simple and easy to take full advantage of. For the entire game I was able to get very single one of my salesmen out where I wanted them to be. There wasn't many left over cars on each round either despite the fact that all 4 of us were buying the maximum # of cars each round on each spot. The number of cars for sale was quite predictable since a majority of the tiles were out each turn and since we knew where the higher value numbers were going we could plan accordingly. I also think there is a significant advantage to going first and second on the final turn (in a 4 player game). Those two players get first crack at an extra full sale and then can still get a second shot at a discount on another car line. The cars on the board are beautiful but the board has flaws. There is no good place to put # markers down when we flip those. The cars we sell didn't fit into the respective boxes on occasion (we played with the car meeples). And why paper money?!? 
Just a big fail in so many aspects.  I completely appreciate Martin Wallace but this is a dud.

I'm not entirely sure whether I like Automobile or not. It's interesting to play, but after playing only three times we've had tight games every time and it feels as though the winner is usually decided by the draw for the "bonus" demand tiles (particularly for luxury cars) on turns 3 and 4. I am certainly interested in playing more, and I really like the design - particularly the way the game is about managing liquidity, which is fairly unique - but I'm not entirely sure how it's going to fare in the long term.

RATING: 6
I played 4 times, and then traded my copy away.  Somehow, despite my high enthusiasm, the cool theme, and clever mechanisms, this game didn't fully connecting for me.

I find myself feeling a bit shoehorned by the game.  You get 12 player actions.  Each turn you need to produce cars at least once, so there goes at least 4 of your actions.  Of course to produce cars you need to build a factory, and I'd guess you need to build around 3 (or more) factories during the game, so you have 7 or more of your player actions consumed.  So that leaves you no more than 5 actions to your discretion.

Of those discretionary actions, you might close a factory - but you might not, and aim for the executive decision that allows you to close a factory.  That leaves placing distributors, or the uninteresting 'take 2 cubes'.

Building lots of cars is worth exploring, so you might want to double up on production.  If you do this you'll want to spend more time placing distributors.

Choosing Durant may be interesting for the immediate factory build.  I could see where this action might allow you to spend more energy placing distributors and producing large numbers of cars.


Clearly there is some game space to explore.  But is there enough?  For me, the answer was "no".

I've heard it had only 12 decisions in it and thought: "how interesting can it be?". If it wasn't for Wallace's signature, I'd probably have never wanted to try it. But now I played it and I'm glad I did. Even though you have few decisions, each and every one of them is so intrincated and has so many layers that, in the end, you don't notice the lack of decisions at all.

Game of risk management. And putting your opponents in tough spots. 
allthough I played my position right the very last action i took in the game (management decision ) i failed and picked the sell one extra car instead sell all cars from one factory allthough it was obvious i would be stuck with some.  Pretty unbelievable i missed that. Gust took huge risks and because of the mistake that had alain on 3870 money and me on 3820 instead of of a nice 4000 could have grabbed the victory if the single tile drawn for the expensive cars would be a 5 however it was a two meaning he lost 720 cash. otherwise he would have finished in the high 3900 just not 4000 range.

I am not sure what to think of that single tile. He put himself at risk just like alain but instead of counting on a mistake from me (little chance) he counted on odds (one in four games he would make it)  

It's a good game but the twelve actions are quickly spend and much time is lost on income and probability calculation.
we took over three hours. While next games certainly will move quicker the decision you have to make are what  I expect of a one hour game. It  would be agreat one hour game. For a two hour game + the luck it takes too long.

Another excellent Wallace game.  Solid experience with excellent depth and lots of player interaction (quotas, orders, etc.)  A bit more contrived/fiddly than he usually does.

RATING: 5
The game is OK and it actually looks close to what you would really do if you were running a car company. Still it's far from being perfect.

First, it is complex and there is a lot of elements connected together. Which made the teaching of the rules last 1 hour. That is way too much.

Second there is a lot of calculation you could do because everything can be planned. It could add downtime if people start calculating a lot.

Third, there is too much control. The designer tries to force the game to go somewhere and I don't like that. For example, it partially tells you what will happen or what you can do every turn of the game. Which makes it impossible for example to play extra turns because they are not on the chart. I would have preferred a less strict control so that it simplifies the rules and makes replay value more interesting.

Finally, you don't make that much money. The people in first place ended up with approximately twice more money than what they started with. Which make game end up pretty close forcing you to calculate even more since a few dollars lost here and there can make you loose the game. 

So I would really wanted to play faster turns but more turns.

---------------------------------------------------

After a second play, again the difference of money between the players is minimal. So you have actually no idea of what made you won the game.

Second, upgrading your cars is not that useful. The only advantage is that it allows you to have priority in the order of the sale. But you can sell cars with sellers, and since sells are done in rounds, you will be selling something. You can also use executive orders to make more sale, so being last in the rank is not that bad. So instead of wasting actions closing factories, you can just build new ones and never close them.

Finally, the new edition is much harder to play because of the components color (I am partially color bind). There is so much chrome that it is much harder to identify the components. Also the character special abilities are not written on the board, so you have to memorize them. So I personally prefer the original version with the wooden parts.

Build factories, produce cars, and meet demand without too much overproduction.  Watch that your factories aren't too far out of date to avoid too many black loss cubes.  It is interesting that as we have played more games to see different strategies emerge and be successful.  Each game has been different to some extent as people produce more than once in a round or at least mix and match when you produce versus taking another action.  Too many times, people get in the rut of building factories or placing distributors on the first two turns and only producing on the third action turn making the game fairly predictable.  Throw a wrench into normalcy and try different things and see how people react.  I found this game to be very simple and streamlined to play for new people - even if they may not be sure how best to proceed.  I've seen slum-lording work well as long as there was a way to dispose of loss cubes, I've seen people push the car track causing people to buy and sell factories like crazy as losses mount, and other strategies succeed.  It is interesting to watch the different strategies collide and interact.

An interesting game, surprisingly evocative of the period due to the fine graphics and unique mix of mechanics. The demand chits turn the game into a bit of a gambling game with imperfect information. So Automobile reminds me a bit of Manila, but much more competitive and cogitative. And I am impressed with the graphics. I love cars - combined with the linen printed board, old auto artwork, and portraits of famous auto industrialists, this game is a beauty.

Another Wallace's gem. A very interesting euro. You have to balance production and sell in a car market. The characters? Ford, Chrysler, Howard, etc. Incredible economic game.

RATING: 8
Very good economic game that involves managing money, inventory, r and d etc.  I have the sense that my group plays too conservative;y as most cars sell with each turn (having played with both 3 and 5 players).  I wish I knew how to how to maximize my profits in this game but I seem to be missing some strategic piece.

Why does this remind me of the kind of game I would have played as a piece of shareware in the 1980s? I can just see this thing running in glorious 16-color EGA on a DOS machine.

That's not a damnation of _Automobile_, since I like 1980s shareware games.  But as a board game, this is too dry, and there's too much bookkeeping. (Shuffling money back and forth, counting out little cars, etc.)  Feels almost like a teaching simulation -- "this is why companies are forced to constantly develop product," "this is how slim the profit margins can be in business," etc.  The game requires forward planning and a few tough decisions, but the tension is constantly low.  Nobody struggled to make expenses, occasionally you'd have to tighten your belt and spend less during a turn but this never blindsided a player.  

I note two substantive flaws in the game.  One is that the demand tiles you receive at the beginning of each round effectively tell you nothing.  If I draw a pair of 5s, I have know way of knowing whether my opponents have all 2s, or 4s and 5s, so demand is more or less completely random and unknown each turn.

The second is that that loss cubes are not quite punishing enough, particularly on the last turn.  Obsolete factories should NOT be purchased back for full value -- this created a situation where we all thought we had to shutter old factories to avoid loss cubes, but since the factories were going to be bought back at full value, we lost less money by just taking the loss cubes.


Considering all the above, I see little chance I'll take this for another drive.  

Am I the first to observe that the salesmen in the mid-range selling pool look EXACTLY like damned souls swimming in the lake of fire?  Is this Martin's wry comment on the state of the auto industry, 2009?

RATING: 6
This is a really well designed game but my enjoyment comes more from my appreciation of how everything fits together than my turn to turn decision making. Everything here is really tight and if you aren't careful you can hurt yourself more than you help yourself. Even when you are doing well, it seems like every decision is pai ful. At the end of the day, you do get a pretty strong businessman feel, despite the track that determines your production capabilities and partially how much inefficiency cubes you get not really making thematic sense to me.

RATING: 8
Not for those who do not like math or some min/maxing in their games.

Automobile takes basically a marginal gains system and an incrementally more expensive cost track and makes a serious brain burner of a game.

Plays in 90 minutes and while I like it better with 4 than 3, I personally think the game would suffer, at least for one person, with 5; unless you like high screwage. I would wager in a 5p game one person knows half way in that they have lost.

It's a shame that Wallace doesn't seem to be focused on games of this weight any longer as he's VERY good at them.

The game distills the essence of decision making as a CEO of an auto company.  What markets to I enter?  How much do I produce?  How much production should I have?  Do I deal with salesman in my network with guaranteed demand or do I take risks on general demand?  Do I advertise?  Do I discount?  How many loans do I take out to finance investments?  

The game has some simple math but very big decisions.  It is a great economic game and one of my favorite Martin Wallance titles.  I adore this game and it is one of the best pure business games available.

Only played it once at 2009 Lobster Trap.  Perhaps there were too many players, but the game really dragged on waiting for others to decide their moves.

Automobile is very engaging with so many decisions to make with so little time (opportunity) to make them. The theme lends itself to explaining the rules easier as most people are familiar with buying a car.  Maximizing your profits with a win condition of money for a change vs. points is invigorating.  There is a lot of player interaction as well.  Everyone who played it enjoyed it immensely.

[Played 4 times]

An abstract economic engine based on limited resources (you have 12 actions and 8 drafts in all the game). 

In a supposedly strategic game, I find particularly annoying that the exact demand of the market is random (you may only guess it) and yet crucial to determine the outcome of the game.

Mildly interesting, but not that many opportunities and low replay-value (it becomes stale very soon).

A good take on an economy where overproduction can hit you just as hard as not producing enough. Nevertheless, the somewhat overconvoluted mechanisms make me wish that Martin Wallace would set his aims on one great game per year instead of three or more good ones.

Played with three players in our inaugural game. This is one of those games that I really wanted to fall in love with - I really liked Brass and Steam, right from the start. 

The game felt like it lacked a certain tension. This may have been a function of having only 3 players. I imagine the competition is much tighter with 4 or 5 players.

The demand tiles did not seem to factor into our game until the last turn. The decisions seemed obvious at times and somewhat scripted. That being said, there is also a huge potential for analysis paralysis. 

I am not ready to relegate this to the Cash for Clunkers program, however, after one play I'm sad to say I'm slightly disappointed. I would like to play it with 4 or 5 players...which is where I suspect it shines (i'd say there is potential to raise my rating to a 8).

I think it´s a great economics game for 4 players. It´s tight and there is plenty to do. But my friends thinks it´s a bit heavy and hard to grasp the strategy.
I also think it does´nt scale well at 3 players and I miss 2 player support.
I can recommend the old computer game "Motor City" which feels similar and can be played solo.

My favorite Martin Wallace game? Potentially.  I love the thematic feel of this as models become old fashioned and factories that were once cutting edge become bigger and bigger burdens.

Brilliant game. A true economic simulation. Only 12 actions in the game and they are all crucial and tense(not counting character selection and executive decisions just have just as much tension).  You need to be looking at least a turn ahead with each action (which is hard to do until you have a few games under your belt).

There is a fine line between conservatism and aggression in this game. Too much of either will lose it for you. You CANNOT play it safe and only produce cars are guaranteed to sell. You MUST take some risk and overproduce and find a way to stick your opponents with the losses. Dramtically over produce though, and you'll be the one eating loss cubes.

Very Martin Wallace. Loans, penalty for poor management, great thematic tie-in. With only 12 real actions per game (plus decision on character bonus, on dealership sale etc) and only 1 way to make money/vp, players really need to maximize their return every round. Game could get very mathy when balancing loss cubes and more aggressive play. Can't wait to play again. Too bad Wallace hates 2p plays.

Two games in and both times I was plagued with the same problem (being too agressive on the last turn).  Both games I ended up with lots of unsold cards on the final round and this cost me big time.  

The game works and the mechanics have relevance to it's theme.  I like the Mayfair board.

I just found estimating production and matching it to sales to be difficult and somewhat of a crapshoot.  I guess maybe that is reality in the car industry though.

I do have to say I enjoyed my second playing more than the first (despite the extremely slow play of two of my opponents - haha) and will have to give it another kick at the can.

I really wanted to like this more, but it's pretty "mathy."  I got restless while smoke came out of my co-players' ears as they did calculations such as, "this loan will cost me $200, but if I don't take it I will end up with 3 black cubes which will cost me $275 over the next two turns, unless I get to choose Kittering, or, alternatively, I could choose this action . . ."

After my first play (5 players), I was distinctly perplexed by this game. There is a lot going on and I never felt I had any idea which action would give any benefit. As play progressed, it became obvious that the various moguls had strengths and weaknesses that varied as the turns progressed, but I didn't feel I'd grasped any strategy that would get me into contention, never mind playing for a win. As a result, by the game's end, I felt I'd had an interesting time, but a frustrating one that had not been fun and decided that the game was not for me. I had no further interest...

... until I found myself thinking about it a lot through the days that followed and, by the time a week had passed, I was eager to play again.

I still performed badly, but this time (4 players) I really enjoyed myself. So much so that I'm probably going to buy it. I think I'll give it one more play to make sure but, all things being equal, this game would leap from a paltry 4 to a respectable 8 and, I guess, may even climb higher. I therefore won't rate it until at least my 3rd play.

The mechanics fit the theme really well.  A fun economic game.

I like this game very much.  I like the way the game looks.  There are a lot of pictures of vintage cars.  I also like the decisions you must make in the game.  You have to decide what kind of cars to produce (cheap, medium or expensive).  You need to decide if you should close an old plant and open a new plant.  You also need to decide how many  cars you should produce at each of your plants.  This game gives you a feel of running a business.

Plays just fine, as you'd expect from Wallace.  Really like the car progression track, and how it works obsolescence in.  However, I think it is too easy to get rid of the black cubes, and difficult to change player order if the leader wants to stay in first.  three actions a turn maybe too restricting, especially considering 'build cars' almost must be chosen.  We4 played very conservatively: wonder how far you can get pressing the envelope.  Box cover not my favorite, but the background illustration is nice.  Not sure what people don't like about the board...

Rating and Comments are for Prototype: I enjoyed this.  I wouldn't call the decisions excruciating but there is a lot to think about.  An economic game that borrows the action selection mechanic from Age of Steam. Players build car factories, distribution centers (where there is some board play mechanics) and decide how many cars to manufacture. In similar fashion to Lokomotive Werks you know some of the market demand but not all of it. Cars are sold each round and unsold cars will earn you losses.

Fun the first (and only) time that I've played... but the game seems to have limited strategic options and is not a game I'm likely to buy even though I like the theme and some aspects of gameplay.

Good thematic feel and mechanics to match but some of the game mechanics and decisions are superfluous.  

If a decision is superfluous, and likely to be made turn after turn, why even bother including it in the game instead of baking it right in (as in allowing players to always perform the action instead of making it a "false choice" among several contending turn options)?

This game had potential, but ruined by poor development imo.

--------------------------------------------

Notes from my one (and likely only) session with this game:

First time played with four players. Rulebook is not clear in a number of places... could really use a better editor.

Anyway, another decent Martin Wallace game. Really like how the mechanics mesh well with the theme (at least compared to other Eurogames). Only 4 turns, and the game is one of those "where the rich become MUCH richer", so very hard to recover from a a single bad mistake or a poor turn.

Decent economic game in some ways, but not convinced this game has long term playability. Specifically, I don't think there will be alot of variability in future plays and each game will be more or less the same. 

There are only 12 actions rounds in the entire game and most players will spend 8 of them building factories and manufacturing cars. That leaves only 4 rounds for something else (likely distribution will take up 2 or 3 action rounds). That's not alot of meaningful choices to make in a 2+ hour game. 

You do get to select a role and there is the executive actions phase, but really, that's not enough given the game length.

"It forces players to play very conservatively, but the winner is often the player who pushing their production to the brink of excess/oversupply... a very solid game with so few actions taken."

Neat, tight game. I see glimpses of Wallace-isms throughout, yet the game feels unique from his other designs. There are few actions in the game but each is very impactful.

I completely suckered myself into this one!  I had recently played another Wallace game, [b][GameID=65781][/b], at a local con, and liked it so much, I decided to take a chance on another game by this designer.  Clearly, I did not do my homework, as these two games are about as similar as an apple and an orange.  The economy in this one is (typically) brutal for a Wallace title, leaving the uninitiated dead in the water for the last 2/3 of the game.  A bit too unforgiving and heavy for my typical gaming group, and certainly not what I bargained for.

Not quite as unforgiving or painful as Steam, and elements of it remind me of 18XX (factories becoming obsolete is reminiscent of trains rusting.) The opacity of the strategy and the consequences of any given choice in the game are a bit unnerving -- I constantly felt like I had no way to exert control over the game state, and everyone felt frustrated at one point at their inability to predict when they got screwed over by another player's choices.

In the end, this game is INTERESTING, but it fails to be FUN or ENJOYABLE.

Whoa!

Give this game more than one chance! And try to avoid APers, particularly on your first play. My learning game was a huge turn-off, as the gears were cranking with my opponents, grinding the game to a standstill with an overload of calculations and counting and recounting. I worried, [i]Is this what this game is all about?[/i] The game seemed interesting, but not at all fun.

My second try was MUCH better. Despite shockingly streamlined rules (for Wallace), there's a lot to consider here. Even though many of your actions are scripted, the execution of those actions requires careful attention to what your opponents are doing. I have a slight worry that this will become easier as one gets used to the game, but for now it's really quite challenging. The choice of roles at the beginning of each round is very interesting and is in some ways the heart of the game.

Definitely think this one has legs and overall feels very different from anything else I've played. Solid.

This is a medium-heavy economics game.

You are producing cars and trying to match your production with demand while updating the versions of the cars. It has been highly praised and it would work nicely for a heavier game.

There are lots of decisions with a relatively small amount of luck.

Martin Wallace games usually have a better than average chance of winning me over.  I love how a strong theme seems to be key component in his games.

Automobile definitely has a strong theme. The idea is simple - build factories, deploy sales distributors, produce cars, and then sell cars for a profit. The last step of making a profit is where things are not so straight forward.  This game requires a fair amount of planning, a little guessing, and hope for the best.  The more I play it, the more I realize it's not as simple as I thought.

What an absolutely brilliant game!  A very theme-strong economic game where balance is the key; balancing the elements of the game, evolution of the product market and opponent screwage.

Plenty to think about and some very nice mechanisms, some of which are familiar from Martin's other games.  The really interesting bit for me is working out how to screw over your competition without significant detriment to yourself.  It can be done but involves some risk taking.

A bit of a brain burner?  Could be if you think about it too much but I think it plays just as well if you play with instinct.

Rating based on two plays - one explained by Martin himself at the UK Expo and the second at a local gaming session (for local people.)

RATING: 7
Solid commodity speculation with nice components. The game is mostly just maths, so it can feel a bit dry, as players just count away and not that much seems to happen on the board. There's very few actions (only 12 actions over 4 rounds in total), so it's unforgiving to the max.

I have a weakness for economic games where players act on a common market which fluctuates due to their own actions. Hence, I kickstarted Brass and while waiting got an opportunity to acquire this less known Wallace title. I was immediately intrigued by the simple yet elegant simulation of the car industry.

Automobile offers the players a careful balance between spending to deliver the top of the line cars and saving to afford the necessary development to continue staying in top. Is this accomplished through complex and fiddly market and development tracks? No, simply draw tiles (looking only at your own tiles) for the demand, spend R&D cubes to build the next generation factories, and supply cars starting from the most modern factories. That's it! Well, there is a bit more but I understand why Wallace considers Automobile one of his best games.

A very good light-medium economic game by Wallace. Smart mechanisms where players interact to take better positions in the technology race for more advanced cars, at the dawn of the car industry, while you must keep the balance between how many cars you will produce and sell. Smart game and with very good production value.

RATING: 8
A pretty great economic game about producing and selling cars. I still haven't figured out the best strategy on this game and I frequently lose... However, it's quite fun. The only negative thing I can say about it is that sometimes the possible actions can feel limiting - there's only so many things you can do (mostly, building factories, and building cars) but the timing of when you choose to do those things can make or break your score. I recommend it to those who want a slow, methodically paced economic game.

A solid economic game. While you only really need to take 12 simple turns in a game, even one small mistake costs you the game.

My favorite game at The 2009 Gathering!!  What a great simulation of the economic realities that got the American Auto industry into the situation it is in today....we are a car society with ingenuity in design and performance!!  Note:  played the prototype, which I assume is close to final from the smooth manner it played in my two games).

Thanks for yet another wonderful, wonderful challenge and experience, Martin!!  It is amazing how Mr. Wallace can distill R&D, the concept of efficiency, production, demand forecasts(market research) parts, three segments of vehicles (luxury, mid-market and mass market), segment progression and decline, private distributors and retail and wholesale sales into one game.  The progression of the technology and demand trends are layed out in a fascinating way to figure out where your companies best spot is in the marketplace based on all the plans of the other companies and your own ambitions.  The historical characters you can play in in one of four rounds include:  Ford, Kessling, Sloan, Howard, Durham and Chrysler (each with his own unique ability).  There is even a board of directors making executive decisions about both production and selling strategies.

The ability to combine game mechanics and theme is just superb in this one!!

One takes the role of an automobile manufacturer in the late 19th century. The game is comprised of four turns. Each turn, the player sees their own demand for middle class, mass market and luxury cars, which helps them plan for their production. Each turn, a player chooses a role which gives them a bonus. They then take 3 actions to put down factories, produce cars, shut down factories, or put more salesmen into play. 

Factories are staged around the board so that older factories become obsolete, and will take "loss" cubes. Similarly, you earn loss cubes for unsold cars, and unused salesmen.

This i a typical Martin Wallace offering with tough decisions, and loss cubes to worry about. It's an okay game to play, and clocks in around 2 hours.

I'm a little disappointed with this game because I don't find the fun as other game of Wallace.

The gameplay fits the theme, but not much else is good. Lots of calculations needed, huge AP potential. Tactical game, that seems to be strategic. Unfortunately when acquiring factories you are restricted by the choices of your fellow players, so there is not much control over this, which seems to be the most important decision in the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It's an economic game with lots of features typical of Wallace's games (loans you have to suffer all game long brutal competition, "realistic" market simulation, etc).

It's a medium to heavy game: it's not difficult to make the calculations, but it's hard to predict what your rivals do, and this as important as your own actions: a simple unexpected action of one of your rivals can make you lose a lot of money, and then the game.

Even if this edition doesn't have wooden cars, I like the quality of the components (yes, I know it includes papernotes). The 20's throwback graphic design is quite elegant, even if the part of the boardgame that it's not cars is certainly improvable.

I don't like the part where you lose the game only because one of your competitors decided to reduce drastically their prices and there's nothing you can do about it, it's too harsh and "unfair" for me. But the experience is worth it. I would certainly play it again.

The game is on a highly abstracted level. It actually felt almost a bit too abstract for my taste. There is pretty much only a development track around the game board and few places for distributors. Rest is more or less memory aid. The game itself is interesting with only 12 actions during the game. You build/close factories (production lines really), produce cars and try to sell them for profit and hope there is enough demand. It's a game of economics and I liked it but it might be better with more players as 3 felt too few. Update: After playing with 4 (and correct rules) it seems to be better this way. Would work mechanically well with 5 too but in our group the length of game would be too long.

Interesting game, though we are definately not on the fun side (serious game for serious gamers), and I'm not sure to be found of a 2-hours game concentrated in 12 "big" actions to perform, and half of them minimum dedicated to fixed actions for structure (1 prod min per turn, and 2 buildings min). Of course, it is a game of rythm, opportunities and costs, but I felt it was a bit too demanding.
With Brass, I really have the impression to build something, while here I have the impression (certainly false due to lack of experience) to solve a mathematical problem.

Poche partite all'attivo e, per quanto il gioco mi piaccia, comincio a sospettare che il difetto più evidente possa essere la longevità. Per il resto il gioco è ben pensato, dall'ambientazione alle meccaniche. I materiali sono buoni e la spiegazione (come per molti giochi di Wallace) è complessa e non adatta a giocatori occasionali; anche se in realtà dopo pochi turni si prende confidenza con il gioco. Le partite durano solo 4 turni durante i quali ogni giocatore potrà effettuare solo 3 azioni principali; ne consegue che anche un errore potrebbe pregiudicare l'esito della sfida. Un gioco con molti calcoli che comunque consiglio specie per gli amanti dei giochi di Wallace come me.

Solid, sprawling economic fare with Wallace's usual attention for detail and history. Plays fast in the right hands; agonisingly slow in the wrong ones.

A very enjoyable game. A game that thrusts you back in time and in the position of selling cars at the dawn of the auto industry. A polished game experience, fun and intuitive mechanics and emersive gameplay. When I first read about the whole game only taking 5 rounds, I thought wow...is that possible to put a game in 5 turns. I am totally impressed at the strategy you must put into each step of a 5 round game. Each round has many steps and each one is fully important and needs your complete attention. 

A great game that I thought wouldn't be for me but it definitely is. The artwork and components are impeccable. I will never doubt Martin Wallace again.

RATING: 5
It is not bad, but not great. You are very constrained about what you can do. Best with 3 players - adding more just makes it harder to plan for the demand (more random), and the competition becomes more chaotic (in terms of which factories you are able to predict are likely to be bought - too much can change with 4 other players taking actions between your turns).

It seems a game of continual planning for potential disasters, calculating how far you can push things. There's some nice interleaving of mechanisms, starting with the character choices which dictate turn order and special actions. You want to go first to sell cars more easily in the first sell phase, but you want to go last to build the most advanced factory, see what the others are building and therefore minimise risk and sell cars more easily in the second sell phase. Once played, the theme brings it all together well. But that doesn't make the choices you're faced with any easier, especially when you add in the obsolescence feature which forces people to continually sell off and build new factories to re-gain better position in the sell-off pecking order. It's one for the business game lovers out there, not one for the thrill seekers. And I can't help but think after a couple of plays that too much of your game is dependent on turn order at particular times (and what people leave you in that turn order) and the vagaries of the semi-random sale number generator process that may well determine whether you sell for profit or take a loss, which can be a fair sized swing in your money and therefore your result, with only 4 turns in the game.

Very interesting game which needs a bit more exploring though. There is one little thing I have to complain about... the board should have some small icons for the characters so that players know what the special powers are. Newcomers will always feel overwhelmed by this. All information should be readily available to everybody, here it isn't... not a deadly sin, but shame it isn't there.

Played the pre-production game several times at TGoF-09, I found that aggressive production and marketing paid off, but this has to be a group-culture thing. In the games I played, people tended to be overcautious, losing profits from under-production, which is almost as bad as over-producing.

Automania posed similar problems, but there the decisions were revealed simultaneously, making it a pure guessing game. Here the sequential nature of actions and the ability to effect the player order  confront the players with more subtle choices. Go early and get first choice of the marketing options, or go late and react to the other players' production decisions

Nice theme and original mechanics. The game is fun to play, but somewhat complicated and the learning curve may turn off many since the actions of others has a huge effect on your actions. If explained well the game turns are fairly simple, but you can get hit pretty hard by a miss calculation. The game is very nice looking and the theme fits in well. Every games is different and there are a proper amount of unknowns, a must try.

RATING: 7
My first game I was confused by the complexity and I didn't really know what was going on until the third turn (of four).  The game is very pretty and colorful, but the information printed on the board is overwhelmingly comprehensive.  It was a lot better the second game.  Apparently, you need to take risks in this game; caution is not rewarded.  We rarely (maybe once each game) produced more cars than we could sell, and those who took out loans and built the parts factory scored big.  On the other hand, a player aid for new players that lists the five possible actions would be very helpful.

Wallace è una garanzia, e anche stavolta sforna delicatissime meccaniche a orologeria in un gioco che rappresenta alla perfezione la definizione di "Gamers' Game", un gioco pensato per i giocatori assidui. All'insegna della scarsità di risorse e di moltissima interazione diretta, i giocatori non vincono se producono a basso rischio, ma perdono sonoramente se sbagliano i conti mettendo sul mercato troppe auto. Un gioco senza pietà: una o due azioni sprecate nelle dodici complessive pesano tantissimo. Inoltre, i margini sulle auto sono bassissimi. E' molto ben trasposto il meccanismo di scelta dei personaggi, eccezionale il sistema di corsa alla tecnologia, che obbliga gli ultimi a investire in ricerca per non essere fuori dai giochi. Le meccaniche della vendita mi hanno lasciato più indifferente: molto poco rischio calcolato (conoscere la tua tessera mercato non ti aiuta a farti un'idea della domanda totale) e difficile farsi un'idea di come andranno le vendite (tra venditori e cilindretti bianchi/grigi anche l'ultimo del turno potrebbe piazzare tutta la sua produzione prima degli altri). Forse una partita a cinque rende il tutto più caotico: penso che in quattro o in tre il gioco diventi più strategico. A trovare qualcosa che non (mi) va, i marchi di fabbrica di Wallace: l'estrema bruttezza della grafica della plancia, forse la peggiore in assoluto della sua produzione (ma i componenti di legno sono notevoli) e l'impianto delle regole molto indigesto (e pesantemente basato sui calcoli). Infine, complici i due punti di cui sopra, nonostante i disegni davvero osceni delle auto e qualche finezza (l'andamento della domanda del mercato delle auto, davvero ben pensata), l'asciuttezza del gioco mi lascia un retrogusto di astrattone. Comunque, un gioco che tutto sommato non delude le aspettative.

RATING: 7
Second play.. I suspect this game is really Wallace's next masterpiece.  And yes, we did get a few rules wrong.  But mostly we were just underproducing cars.  I compensated by seriously overproducing in my second game.  

After more plays.. I really like this game. so cool and focussed on one industry. I'm not sure all the chrome makes it though.  I want to try Lokomotive Werks and compare.

RATING: 8
This is one of the better supply-and-demand type games that I've played.  This game is full of agonizing decisions.  You need to invest in factories to produce cars, but if you buy a factory that quickly becomes outdated, you could start raking in the losses.  You want to produce and sell as many cars as you can, but if you overproduce, not only is the excess wasted, but you take a loss for every unsold car.  Distributors can be a good way to get around your competition, but if you hire too many distributors, they too will take losses.  Every decision can either make you a significant profit or put you in a deep hole (and sometimes both!), giving you tons to think about.

A Wallace-game without a map, but still with all the characteristics of the designer.

Automobile is a economic game where demand is hard to estimate, and where reckless moves will cost you dearly.

There is lots of interaction and watching your opposing players make their moves is just as exiting as doing your own.

Seeing the board and reading about it on the geek, I was expecting a much drier and abstract game, but this game has a good theme.

Very good game.

After one bad experience caused by a few major rules mistakes the second game was better. 

It's a business game with a car building theme: build factories to produce cars and then sell them in the market. Demand is unpredictable within certain boundaries and if you overproduce you'll be stuck with the unsold cars.

It seems important to manage your money carefully (duh), not to overbuild production capacity and to try and stay ahead of the demand trends. 

One of my problems with it, is that 95% of the decision making seems to happen in the character selection phase, because that's where turn order is determined. Also, there aren't a lot of actions during a full game so it feels that your decisions don't matter as much as they should.

It's not a bad game, but I didn't enjoy it as much as I expected. It's very calculational and at the same time fairly chaotic and unpredictable in the selling phase. 

I won't refuse to play it, if in the right mood, but it's far from being a personal favorite.

After the rules are explained, I was a bit lost, but once we started to play, this went on smoothly and made sense. I heard from other players that three was too few for this game, well, I liked it with three. Nice and quick. Mister Wallace has a gift of making an economic game playable to even those who dislike them.

I really enjoy the mechanics, and I enjoy how the timing of everything has a big say on whether or not a good strategy pays off.  As with most Marty Wally games, bad play will get you killed, and the game can feel decided by the mid-3rd round (out of 4), but the turn in a game hinges on some pretty subtle elements, and you need a nice blend of aggression and timing to win.

The Martin Wallace games I've played - Steam, Brass, and now Automobile - all seem to rate an 8 for me. Just the tiniest bit too heavy and unforgiving and mathy for my tastes, but wonderful, engrossing, cerebral designs. It's hard to say which one I like best, and they're still different enough that I'm glad I own all three.

Automobile is a game that asks two questions: How many cars am I going to sell this round, and how do I manage my loss cubes? All tactical decisions follow from those strategic questions. Where, when and how many factories am I going to build? What CEO will I take? &c. You have to be mindful of step 6 right when you start at step 1. Everything works together in a web of pushes and pulls that make figuring out what you want to do tremendously interesting.

Player interaction is everything. Every move a player makes is an aggression. Someone builds a factory? That means they plan to build more cars, thus sell more cars, and take a bigger portion of market demand, which means that you can sell less, so maybe should produce less, so maybe shouldn't build a factory yourself. But that means giving an edge to the other player, so maybe you do want to build a factory and prepare to fight over the market.

Like the other Wallace games, Automobile is a constant struggle that requires constant calculations and risk estimates, without ever giving you the sense that you're doing well and can relax a bit. If that's something you don't mind, if you like to work for satisfying victories more than friendly evenings where everyone is pleased with how they're doing, I can give my highest recommendations for Automobile.

Unique economics game that has a innovative supply/demand system. I can see what this game is going for, but it has some issues such as the character tiles all having abilities that are not indicated on the tile, and a lack of player aids. This was mostly just a bad fit for me, but there were others in my group who enjoyed it a lot. I was frustrated that the game has some paths that are worth less than other paths, and following one of those means you will have a hard time catching up.

Martin Wallace has managed to make the mechanics fit perfectly with the theme and it really feels like running a business. I like that you are doing well if you double your money over the game - unlike the unrealistic economies in Power Grid, Acquire and others. It's also a good mixture of calculation and chance. Just like in real business, you don't know the exact market conditions and sometimes you just have to go with your gut.

UPDATE 
I was blown away by Automobile at first, but all my plays of it came within the first month and I haven't really wanted to pull it out since. The problem is the jarring contrast between the detailed profit and loss calculations needed and the randomness that can render them meaningless. I think the demand tile mechanic needs fixing, because the tiles you see simply aren't enough to tell you anything useful. Playing a lot of Brass online later in the year reaffirmed how much better it is than 'mobile, and I traded it away in December '09.

Automobile is surprisingly suspenseful and has a lot of different interesting choices.  I've read people who think that there are not very many choices to make when playing Automobile and I completely disagree.  Each decision of what to make and where to spend your actions is a dynamic process.  Additionally, each decision that each other player makes greatly affects what decisions you can and should make.

I have only played Automobile with five players, and I can imagine that it would play suboptimally with less than five.  This game is one of the few games that is all about player interaction that I still find enjoyable.

RATING: N/A
Players build factories for various automobile models and sell their vehicles through distributors and direct sales. Building a new model with low demand is costly, as is maintaining an obsolete factory. Tiles secretly drawn each round determine adjustments in public demand. Then, role selection of auto industry pioneers provide benefits to each player -- e.g. Henry Ford allows you to buy an extra factory each turn. During the action phase, players can then: build or shut down factories (brand new models require R&D cubes), place distributors to sell your cars, take R&D cubes, or produce (following strict guidelines for the factories owned. During the Executive Decisions phase, players get bonuses such as shutting down an extra factory or using R&D cubes to launch a reduced price sale. Finally, cars are sold to the general public, as demand tiles are revealed and, naturally, the newest ,odels are the first to sell. Loss cubes are assigned for unsold cars, older modls getting the most cubes. A deep game requiring difficult mental calculation, a balance of aggression and restraint, and the ability to effectively forecast demand.

3+.

Excellent ... and even better if you follow the rules properly which we didn't do at the first time of playing ... but, nothing new there!  I enjoy the way you have to balance production with distribution whilst improving your car  models and handling your growing automobile empire.  I would highly recommend this game and feel it will get many plays within our group.  And I've decided that I really like Martin Wallace games!

RATING: 7.9
A really good simulation game of the the early car industry.  Starts with choosing expert advice then deciding how much to go all in with factory innovation and car production.  Then you have the burden of getting rid of all the cars through various outlets while all in competition with each other.  A really tough game that involves a lot of calculations but feels rewarding when things work out but can be quite frustrating when they don't.  Good simulation and game.

The amount of calculation necessary during the game makes this game more an economic simulation than a fun game, I guess. I still think it's a good game. But for me it's not to enjoy in relaxed way. I want to play it good and that makes a lot of calculation a necessity.

Tight, very tight economic game.  As with many games of this nature, can drag on if over-analyzed especially as the game's randomness (demand) is trying to stop that.  With the right group, this one can be played quickly and lasts just long enough to enjoy the ride without getting exhausted.  Thematically, I enjoy it also - as new models are introduced and old ones made obsolete.

My rating seems unfair, as this really is a good game -- well-designed and both thematic and immersive to play.  However, as with most good Martin Wallace games, it's a deep brain burner and not short.

This is such a good economic engine game that I could see it being used to train managers in Corporations.  It's obvious that the automotive theme came first and spawned the mechanics, as opposed to the other way around.

We played a 5-person learning game with some real AP players that took almost four hours!  Major mistakes were made that we would love to correct next time.  The point is that everyone is already eager for a "next time."

Wow. This game was great. My first play was a 4 player game where no one had played before. I like how every decision you make matters in some shape or form. Since none of us knew how to play, we were really scared of losses, so we all played very conservatively. 

At the end of the game there was a winner and a loser (person in last place, which was me) but no one could explain how we ended up in those positions. Looking back over our decisions as best as we could, we could speculate what we assume we did wrong or could have done differently (some which would clearly have helped), but we couldn't actually say if it is what determined the outcome of the game. I would definitely love to play this again.

This Game is really a lot of fun.  I cannot get this game to the table though. The theme or the sheer look of the board turns people away.  The board is beautiful however there is so much on the board it intimidates a lot of people. The game is pretty math intensive also.  I am hoping to get this game to the table more. You are Basically Building and selling cars for the most profit.. using salesmen.. promotional offers and developing the latest and greatest vehicles.

Pros: Fun economic game play, Original gameplay, Beautiful components, Very competitive.

Cons: longer game play, Math Intensive, Money based game

--Jun2009-- Despite coming in Dead Last, I rather enjoyed my first attempt.  I was tremendously amused by the ripples set up by various decisions.  It's not at all clear that I'll be able to get this to the table regularly, but I think it will play reasonably quickly with a bit of practice, and - perhaps more importantly - some improved play will prove possible with that practice. 

It's an interesting system:  I think there's room for having more information about the incoming demand - but I don't know how it could work cleanly.  Perhaps one could trade a R&D cube or two for a glimpse of neighbours' demand tiles?  It's not quite right:  the economy of R&D cubes is tighter than that, and there's not a lot of excess left.

After a third play, I can see some new opportunities for havoc that I hadn't noticed the first time out.  Very happy to have bought it.

--Feb2010-- I think the comparison to _Lokomotive Werks_ is overwrought; they seem like quite divergent exercises to me, even though there's common shared themes of demand and obsolescence.

The mechanic in Automobile where the players build new models of cars in order and old models become obsolete is genius. The game plays well and there's things to be considered all the time. The few concerns that I have after one game are: the art is not as nice as it could be, the cheap cars become dominant in the end-game and seem to be the only way to win? Also if make a mistake during the game it's quite hard to make up for it later. Anyways looking forward to playing this again.

RATING: 7
After three plays we got this down to a sub 90 minute game, which makes me wonder where we were wasting all the time during the first two plays. All in all it boils down to the ability to do multiple arithmetic in your head (preferably quickly), and your luck in the demand draw (of which the luxury cars is a complete crap shoot). That said, it's an interesting ride with some interesting choices, but that's just me - I don't mind these types of games. There's a tendency for play to slow down as calculations are made by each player for each scenario. Using my imagination the theme is well meshed with the mechanics because of the best bit in the game - the characters and their historically based and well balanced skills. I don't see my rating for this increasing, and while I'm tempted to nudge it up to an eight because of the great board design and well written rules, I feel that would be meta-rating, so it's a solid seven for me.

I hate, hate, hate the new Mayfair board and cardboard bits. Three different shades of boring in my opinion. Where the original board has all the important information standing out, the new one has everything blurring into one mess of brown and grey. The dumbest thing they did was remove the text on the character selections. Why? To make the game harder to play? Tastes differ I guess, but in my opinion it's just awful. Seek out the original Warfrog edition if you get the chance.

RATING: 7
Straight up, this game is merely about being efficient beyond a fault, since the tension comes from the board, not from other players. I usually don't like these games, but Automobile is fun, engaging and elegant enough that I am willing to play this over and over.

This game is all about financial blackjack. Produce too few cars and that's a lost profit opportunity. But even worse, produce too many, and you're saddled with loss cubes. Go as close as you can to the limit, but don't saturate.

This is the lightest of Martin Wallace's heavy games, because it plays comfortably in 2 hours, it has no interesting spatial element, and you only have 12+ actions to take, of which many are somewhat scripted. But the simplicity of the 3x4 action structure lends this game an air of elegance. It means every action you take is very, very important, and just the slightest mistake will leave you with regret for days. It also means it's easy to recount what you did, and troubleshoot what you can do better next time.

This game provides a great lesson in investment. Should you take a loan? Can you make a good profit from your new factory? Are you going to take risks and try to sell in bulk with high margins, or are you going to take a more cautious approach?

4+3

I gave this a 7.  I really wanted to give it an 8, but there are some things that irked me after my first play.  The executive decisions don't seem to have the same impact that the special bits in Tinners Trail have.  The demand tiles feel a bit wonky and tacked on as well.  I love Tinners, it's my #1 as I write this and I wanted to love this as much.  There is a caveat though - I had questions after my first play of Tinners as well.  The only difference is that I didn't enjoy the gameplay of Automobile as much during the first play as I enjoyed Tinners.  So, I will stick to my 7 rating with the potential for increase with additional plays.

I found this to be an interesting development of some of the ideas found in Lokomotive Werks.  Unlike some others, I only see a mild resemblance.  The gameplay actually seems to be much different to me.  My biggest issue is that most everything essentially disappears from round to round.  I think I would like it better if things hung around a little more.  I do like the use of the loss cubes.  My opinion of the white cubes is a little less developed at this point.  Perhaps that will change with more plays. All in all, a game I look forward to playing again. [06/28/2009]

[1 play] Man I wish I could rate this higher, I was expecting great things from Automobile. I am willing to play it again with more players (we played with 3) to find out if that increases the tension and the decision making. In a 3 player game it just didn't seem to have enough of either. The theme also seemed inconsequential, and that was even more troubling to me somehow. The amount of rules and procedural steps in a game should be proportional to the fun, and if that ratio is skewed in the wrong direction, it is the biggest factor in my feelings about a game - especially a multiplayer game. Overall, I'm disappointed, but Wallace games can be a big hit or miss for me, so not surprised. 

Perhaps one more chance to be fair. I sense I'm becoming jaded about all of the "latest and greatest" and I think maybe I'll be happiest if I try to make sure I'm spending +80% of my gaming time on tried and true favorites.

Most recent play 3-13-11 with Michael and Donovan.

Update Nov. ‘17: Kraftwagen is so very much superior to this. I don’t think I could be talked into play Automobile again knowing that Matthias Cramer created a far better game in this genre.

Очередное блюдо от Мартина Уоллеса. Игра примерно такая же по уровню сложности механики, как Брасс. Требует больших прогностических способностей. Для полноценного погружения в тему и игровой процесс необходимо отыграть не меньше 3-5 партий (кому сколько потребуется). Сначала реиграбельность кажется близкой к бесконечности, но после десятка партий, стратегии примелькаются и уже не кажутся столь оригинальными. При всём при том, что аналогия с другими играми данного автора в стиле механики очевидна, сам игровой процесс абсолютно аутентичен.

Egyértelműen pozitív csalódás volt a játék. Előzőleg arról olvastam, hogy unalmas, bonyolult, nehéz szabályú és nagyon számolgatós játékról van szó. Ezzel szemben egyáltalán nem bonyolult a szabály megítélésem szerint. Jól játszani és nyerni tényleg nem egyszerű, de pár játék után már biztosan kezd összeállni a kép. A számolgatás pedig egyáltalán nem vészes. Persze 5 olyan játékossal, akik hajlamosak mindent kigondolni nem rövid a játék, de a fix 5 kör is behatárolja azért egy parti idejét.
Nagyon sok jó mechanizmus megtalálható az Automobile-ban és főleg a jó összegyúrást tartom a játék erősségének, illetve nekem sikerült beleélnem a témába magam, ezért száraznak sem éreztem, igaz az új 2010-es kiadással volt alkalmam játszani, ami szerintem nagyon szépre sikeredett.
Különböző autókat gyártunk a gyárainkban, amiből minél többet el szeretnénk adni valamelyik híres az autógyártásban szerepet játszó szereplő segítségével. Folyamatosan új modelleket kell kifejlesztenünk és a régieket gyártó gyárainkat bezárni. Figyelni kell minden eladási lehetőségre és a többiek fejlesztéseire és gyártására.
Nagyon jól kitalált a fejlődő mechanizmus, nagyon tetszik a piaci kereskedők megoldása, jók a szereplők és a büntetőkockák is. A játék igazi kérdése, hogy milyen 3-an illetve 4-en játszani, Először úgy éreztem kevesebben jobb, de lehet épp ellenkezőleg. Egy következő játék után ez alapján még akár emelkedhet is a pont, mert én egy nagyon erős játékot ismertem meg az Automobile-ban, ami bárkinek ugyan nem ajánlható, de aki nem riad vissza egy kis számolgatástól annak be fog jönni.

3-an is ugyanazt az élményt hozta a játék, mint öten, sőt a rövidebb játékidő még szimpatikusabbá teszi kis játékosszámmal. Igaz öten talán izgalmasabb és kevésbé számolgatós.

Very tight economic system.  This is a classic Wallace too many things that you need to do with not enough actions to do them with kind of game.  There are so many ways to push yourself here.  You are constantly being challenged.  

Those that want to be constantly pressured by an abstract economy will really enjoy this.  I suspect that others will find it dry and too much work.  I really enjoyed the challenge of it.

UPDATE: The released version is a bit different from the original design.  While I liked the map of America and the challenge of maintaining distribution, this simplification makes for less absolute screwage and lightens the game up.  I think it is better for the change, but I do miss the brutality of having to manage your network as well.

It's...ok.  The subject is interesting even if the theme isn't.  I don't know many games that have mechanics that try to simulate business decisions, much less games that demand innovation just to tread water.  Automobile does it efficiently even if the strategy feels shallow.

If you liked Tinner's Trail but thought it was too light, this might be for you: it feels a bit like TT but with added depth/complexity. It's a good economics game ... I just wish I could figure it out!

Compared to TT (similarities):
- 4 Turns, multiple steps each turn.
- VERY true to the theme: you face decisions about how many/what type of cars to make, when to make them, how to sell them better and beat the competition, how much effort (actions) to spend on research, how to minimize losses (from inefficient factories and dealerships/distributors), etc.
- you have some turn order manipulation going on: turn order changes, based on when you pass the previous turn
- you produce stuff. In Automobile it's cars vs. copper/tin, of course, but you also have more options (type of car, specific factory does matter).
- sell stuff. But not all that you produce -- only what is determined by the demand tiles. And you may not get to sell everything -- you _are_ competing with other players directly here. Also, demand is somewhat random (although you do have limited partial knowledge) so you need to take steps to ensure you can sell what you produce.
- all of the above is modified by which Character/Role/special action (TT) you choose, which are also true to theme.

Others have compared it to Lokomotive Werks, which I've only played once:
- cars vs. trains
- similar overall premise/theme: build factories of varying technology levels, produce stuff, sell based on (randomly determined) demand. In Loko, though, the demand is known at the beginning of the turn. In Auto, you have to deal with more uncertainty -- and there are several ways to do so (build higher-tech factories, control number of cars you produce, establish a distributor network, choose Howard, take multiple executive actions).
- Whereas Loko seems very bare bones, almost as dry as a complete abstract, Automobile seems to be a much fuller, complete experience. There is a LOT more going on in Automobile (roles, extra actions, etc.), in a very well-integrated and thematic way.
- Loko, in my one play, also seemed extremely brutal -- and in an almost random/unpredictable way (although I suspect that's just because of lack of experience with the game?). Still, I think I need to go back and try Loko again just to get a better feel for it.

A well produced game that is visually striking and is dripping with theme.  I enjoy economic games and, after my initial play, I liked it to a certain extent and my rating could actually improve.  I have a couple issues though.  First, we had 12 actions in the game (not counting choosing a role, which seems rather minor).  Everyone uses 4 of those for production, so that leaves only 8 real decisions in the entire game, and four of those are almost always to build  factory, resulting in four actions in the entire game that you may use differently than your opponents.  That's not much for such a long game.  You can argue that there are meaningful decisions within all the actions, such as how many cars to produce during the production phase.  However, that leads to my second issue.  Normally you want to produce to the maximum your factory will allow, so then you have to hope you don't get unlucky with the random tile pulls.  I think this is the most critical aspect that determines the winner.  In other words, all the time building and planning during a two hour game comes down to random tile draws.  In our game, for example, the mid-sized cars at the end came out unusually low, so I missed out on selling one car, the difference between first and third place.  Lastly, selling your factories back at the end for full price makes no economic sense.  It seems there should be some type of sliding scale depending upon the age of the factory.  Maybe I'm being too picky here and some of my observations could prove to be incorrect upon further plays. Perhaps the luck element representing consumer demand is a realistic simulation of the fickle buying public!  In short, I still like the game, but there aren't enough meaningful decisions and it may often boil down to random elements to determine the winner.  Then again, I seem to be one of the few who does not like Brass, so perhaps my rating should be taken with a grain of salt.

Played the final version at LeiriaCon 09 and really liked the game. It has a very accurate historical feeling and the decisions although not agonizing are still very tough to make. A serious candidate at best of the year.

Played two times in a row which has to mean something about the game. Liked it a lot. It's one of those games where players are always searching for best moves and analysing their mistakes. Played with 3 and four players. It has a very different feeling when played with different number of players.

This is a very special game to me as it reminds me of some of the most fantastic gaming nights I've had in my life. I actually played 3 Automobile in a row until sunrise with a friend that is not with us anymore. Thank you Inácio! Have fun wherever you are.

Thoughts after one play - approachable but deep game that will play quickly, mechanics work very well with theme. Demand,  production and sale models very clever. Purchased UK Expo (could n't wait for my shop copies....)

2nd game - Brain burner, mistakes in last round can be brutal. Interested to see how demand works with less than five players. 

3rd game - 4 players. Demand still close to mean. Interesting psychology at Exec. decisions - One person taking a bonus/discount cube sparks a rush.
Interaction and turn order key, in some circumstances worth producing less to avoid exec.decisions then grabbing first  role selection, however by reducing the supply you allow others to avoid spending r&d cubes.

Interesting contest between the inefficient producers 2 spots x 1 fac vs.the 2/3 factories. They had economy of scale and actions i had better ability to  sell.

4th game 3 player and more options open and also more obvious effect of actions on other players, so
you have more control and can game it a bit more than with 4 or 5. Think 4 is optimum number? 

5th 6th games. Feels poker like in that it pays to do the  opposite of the concensus, tight v loose and loose v tight. Also that over production can force opponents to follow suit. Conservative play rewards over producers especially 3/4 player (Edit - no accurate play)

7th game. Fairly brutal to new players. Furthest i have seen players build, newplayers tooscared ofloss cubes?

12th game first of 2010 (August) and burning out in last 2 games played in 2009. Still a great game, v interactive but indirectly

Having played Vinhos a couple of times it always makes me want to play  Automobile which is a far superior business game

RATING: 8.5
The good: Every decision you make is meaningful and has broad implications for your future and impacts the other players dramatically.  – I love the tough decisions, what car to research and build, how many distributors to place, role selection, how many cars to build, all of these decisions have implications on for your future.  

The bad: Every decision you make is meaningful and has broad implications for your future and impacts the other players dramatically.   – The trouble with that is you need to add the information of the last move and recalculate your move in order to optimize your move.  This need to reanalyze once it gets to your turn causes the game to drag a little and the amount of information you need to process can be daunting.

The depth of each aspect of the game is shocking in its simplicity.   I will just describe one action as an example of the simplicity vs. depth:  Deciding what car to build has layers of strategy, save or use your research cubes, if you use all your cubes to jump ahead a couple cars, it only serves to allow the players behind you to get ahead of you cheaply.  That is in addition to what type of car you can build, how many factories, how many cars you can build (with and without a loan).  All these decisions have to consider, what markets you are already in, where your distributors are, what markets your opponents are in, how much money they have, and what markets you EXPECT them to be in.  

All in all, frustratingly deep, annoyingly long, but immensely fulfilling.  I give it an 8.5.  

***I am amending the annoyingly long part. That is only with the 'wrong crowd'.  AP prone players can make this drag. 8.5 is still appropriate but this should play fairly quickly if you can nudge the AP prone players along a little bit.

This game is just plain awful. It seems Wallace was so transfixed in getting the theme cross that he forgot to actually design a game here. The game puts you in a role of a production process manager of a car factory and it's about as exciting as that sounds. This game provides virtually nothing in the way of meaningfull decisions, as many of them are necessary actions anyway. That wouldn't be too bad in a 30 minutes game, but is inexcusable in a game that takes at least two hours. 

Not only is this game not for me, I'm honestly shocked that people could like this, let alone call it a favorite. Do they actually *like* drudgery?

RATING: 7.5
Not Wallace's best, as it can suffer from pretty severe AP a some points, and the game lasts about 30% longer than it really should because the car sales portion of the game can sometimes need to be moved through step by step (sometimes the sales portion moves quickly though because there are plenty of buyers).  But the game itself is quite good with lots going on, and while you can take risks, you're not  subject to wild swings of luck (although that very thing is what makes it subject to some turns of severe AP). 

Typical of many of Wallace's games, to play well, you must actually take the time to analyze your relative positioning amongst players before you can analyze your best move.  This is good for overall competitive play, but bad when any of your players is impatient.

I'm still undecided on whether the game holds enough interest to justify the play-time.

I wish I could separate my ratings into "willingness to ever play again" and "quality of design". Automobile gets a '2' for the former and a '?' for the latter. It was a series of dull math problems from start to finish. I haven't played a game this mathy since Power Grid, but at least that has the benefit of a map with some geographical considerations. The theme in Automobile doesn't even begin to peek through the dark clouds -- the board is a bunch of boxes and numbers. 

If you like this kind of thing, your rating is sure to be much higher, and I would recommend you give it a try.

The first thirty years of US auto-making abstracted down to a mere 12 actions.

Our first play was probably too conservative (all cars were sold; nobody used Reduce Price markers; I came 2/5 without using any distributors). Now we have a bit more of a feel for things, I'm hoping in future games we'll push capacity to the limit in search of ever greater profits.

Second play (different group) was much more vicious. Unsold cars just about every turn. Plenty of loss points shared around. Much more cutthroat, but also more arithmetic involved.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.25
Another Wallace game that feels like a Wallace game. Not always a bad thing, and in this case it makes something that is better than average, but not something that I'd play frequently.

I do find some of the choices interesting, especially how your actions depends on what other people have chosen more so than what comes up on the board (as the only random element is the demand tiles). It's similar to other Wallace games where you have to spend money to make money, in this case by buying factories and making cars and then selling said cars for profit, all the while making sure you don't make too many cars or have too many distributors trying to sell said cars. Feels a little too mathy and calculating, especially near the end when you have to decide what type of cars would be best to build.

First game of 4 players I ended in first place with a score of $3930 (second place had $3900). Would have probably done better but I went "balls to the walls" and took a double loan and way over produced just for fun.

Like all the Wallace games I've played, it seems the best strategy is to get as close as possible to bankrupt by using all your money to maximize production and then using that to sling shot yourself back to top. That's what I did, and most people though I was going to lose by the end of the second turn.

After second play I like the game slightly more, mainly because it is unique and I can't think of another game like it. I don't understand the board because it is almost impossible to get around it due to R&D costs, but that's a minor issue. It seems that mass producing one automobile that another person isn't capitalizing on is the way to win, especially the cheap cars.

Very interesting and not dry mechanics. It`s an eurogame, but with theme. Something difrent. 

Sometimes there are problems with the counting in the production action (downtime). With 5 people you know nothing about the demand. How with the replaybility? The places for the factories are always in the same place. Maybe Automobile Magna Carta would be a better game? 

I want to play more. When there is no problem with the replaybility then it would be e great game.

Comenzamos con el juego de moda. La última creación de Wallace es un juego que no dejará indiferente a nadie. Quizá excesivamente matemático el secreto del juego consiste en ser el que mejor tasa coste/beneficio saque del cociente entre crear fábricas y producir automóviles respecto a los coches vendidos. Relativamente complejo por aquello de que hay que saber asumir cuando tener pérdidas y cuando no y saber interpretar en cada momento qué es lo que más nos conviene de cara al objetivo final que no es otro que ser los que más dinero tengamos al final de la partida. Buen juego que se encuentra un peldaño por debajo de sus mejores creaciones.

A very Martin Wallacey game, with personalities from the theme, variable play order, loans, and simulation (but no creation) of markets. A good game to play a few times, but not with a lot of replay.

An extremely well-designed game where the margin between victory and defeat can be razor-thin. I expect this could move along pretty briskly for a big, meaty game with experienced players, but its also a game where things can get a tad too thinky and mathy, gumming up the flow. Also, in the end, it feels more like work than fun (not because it's deep - I love many deep games - but because of the constant calculations needed to play this at a high level). Because of that, Automobile remains a game I'll happily play now and again, but probably won't be one I'll suggest all that often ...

It does a great job of capturing the uncertainty of business decisions -- will I be able to sell all that I produce?  will I leave something on the table by not producing enough?  What market segments look good, and how will my competitors react to that?  Yeah, it is basically an elaborate game of chicken, but that is the point -- it isn't a delicate math puzzle of an economic game, it is about finding the best way to slap around your competitors and muscle them out of the prime markets.  Not one of my all-time favorites, but it is certainly intriguing and worthy of a number of plays.

Multiply seventeen by one hundred and twenty five. Now do thirteen times seventy. Was that fun? If so, then buy and play Automobile, otherwise stay far away.

But, the rules are simple to follow. If you don't particularly like Power Grid, you may not particularly like this one as well. But if you like games like Power Grid, you will really like this one. Very different games but both have the issue of too many things to calculate to make the right decisions. Very well woven the theme of this game and the actual automotive industry.

[thing=39351][/thing] is a medium weight economic game by Martin Wallace, in which the purpose is to make and sell cars in the late 1890 and early 1900. It is, also, a really tight game: only four rounds, with 3 actions (plus a few more decisions) per round.

At the beginning of each round, players secretly take, from a bag, tiles with numbers (from 2 to 5), which will form the demand of cars for that round - but the player only knows the amount he took, and must guess what the overall demand for cars will be. Then each player, in turn order, select a patron - a renowned personality from the auto industry - that will provide some sort of benefit - for example: Ford allows the player, when building factories, to build one extra (up to three); Sloan take away part of the debt (black tokens) of the player; Howard ensures the sell of two cars; and so on.

Then comes the actions part of the round: each player will do 3 actions, one at a time; some of the actions available are:
- build one or two factories (first the player must decide which type of car the factory will made, paying research tokens if the type is more advance than the current type available); 
- producing cars. There are a minimum and a maximum that must be respected, depending on the number of factories the player has for the type of car;
- send sellers (up to three) to the auto show;
- gain research tokens (three). These tokens are used to make more advanced cars and to advertise them.

After each player do his three actions, the sellers sent to the auto show now must be allocated accordingly to the type of car (popular, medium or deluxe) they will sell. Only a given number of sellers can be allocated for each type of car - this number rises in later rounds.

Then comes the executive decisions, which are basically three:
- close factories (gaining back 50% of the price paid for them and returning half of the debt tokens);
- advertise (this assures the sell of more cars, but it must be paid with research tokens);
- do a sale (also helps to sell cars, but for a reduced price);
- pass (this defines the turn order for the next turn).

Now comes the sell of cars accordingly to the demand tiles. The numbers are added up, and everyone sells cars in order of the type of cars, with the more advance models of cars selling first, it is also now that the advertise and sales help with the selling of cars. For example: it is the first round, and the demand are for 12 cars (tiles 2, 2, 3 and 5). Player 1 made 3 cars of the Maxwell Model L (the most advanced model). Player 2 have 4 cars of the Franklin Model A (the second most advanced). Player 3 has also 4 cars to sell, but from the Oldsmobile Curved Dash model (the third most advanced). Finally, Player 4 has 2 cars to sell from the Duryea model (the older model). Player 2 and 3 both have paid for advertisement (one token of advertisement for each). The sell of the 12 cars will occour like this:
- Player 1 sells one car;
- Then Player 2 sells two cars (one normal, one per the advertisement token);
- Then Player 3 sells two cars (one normal, one per the advertisement token);
- Then Player 4 sells one car.
A total of 6 cars were sold. Still 6 to go. So the selling start again:
- Player 1 sells one car;
- Then Player 2 sells two cars (one normal, one per the advertisement token);
- Then Player 3 sells two cars (one normal, one per the advertisement token);
- Then Player 4 sells one car.
All 12 cars from the demand have been sold. All for full price (no one used a sale token). Player 1 was left with still one car to sell.

After the sell part comes the debt/losses. Players will receive one black token for each car not sold, plus one for each seller that couldn't be allocated, plus one for each model of the same type (popular, medium or deluxe) of car more advanced than the type he has to sell. Each black token cost an amount of money to be paid by the player in this phase - the amount increases as the rounds advance.

The round then ends. Basically that is it. Rinse and repeat three more times and the game is over! The player with the most money by the end is the winner.

[thing=39351][/thing] is, as I said, a really tight economic game: there are so few actions, that each must count - no decision can be made lightly, and this is particularly true if the game have 4 or 5 players - the demand, the order of the sells, the use of sellers, advertisement, sales, basically everything has a keener edge with higher player count. The game with 3, though, can be lacking: often the players will mostly just stay out of the way one from the other (since there are three types of cars, in the later rounds it is possible for every player be specialized in one type). My recommendation, then, is to play with 5 - BGG is right that the is best with this number.

The deluxe edition is a treat: the tiles and tokens are thick enough for each to count as two from other games. The paper money is simply beautiful and sturdy. The board... well, it does its job, and is kind of nice, but there is something (maybe is too busy) that prevents me from saying that it is pretty - it is, though, well done, as everything else.

A full game can be played around 90 minutes, even with 5 players. It can be more, of course, but I found [thing=39351][/thing] to be a quicker sort of game, without much room for downtime (but it can induce to some serious AP) - the actions available are simple to understand, the resolution for them is clear.

[thing=39351][/thing] is just a great economic game - fast, fun, mean, hard -, and could be a fine addition to any collection.

This listing is for the Martin Wallace wooden money. It is made on the same wooden tiles as the Automobile factory tiles. Other than that, there is no relation. I bought four bags of the wooden money tiles to use as a bank in 18xx games, or in the place of paper money in other games, just like when people use poker chips.

Definitely the best of the two Wallace transportation games (the other being Ships). It can be played in a relaxed style where you do not press the development track of cars or it can be played very hard and mean where you'll not care as much about taking damage cubes as long as the others get more. There's a lot of calculations involved when trying to figure out how many cars to produce but you can easily also go by your gut feeling. No matter what, the game is great. One of my favourites by Wallace. And I love his games.

Played once with 3 people.  I think it would play better with 4 or 5.  The distributors do not scale based on the number of players, so with 3 the game feels less competitive than it probably should.  We had no problem selling all our vehicles.  Less meaty than it seems at first glance.  I expect if they had kept the distributor map in place instead of abstracting it, the game would have felt more meaty.  But I expect it would not have added much to the gameplay while adding greatly to the time.  As it is, you get a Wallace game that might be able to be played somewhat quickly once folks know the rules.  Like many Wallace games, I probably need to play it many times before I understand the interactions and the strategies.  Unfortunately, the game itself was not that impressive to me otherwise.  Rules were a little hard to follow and the example turns had some pictures which mis-matched the actual actions, so that added to the confusion.  Rating probably will go up with more plays.  I just don't know whether I will play it much more.  Too many good games competing for play time.

For reasons I can't pin down, I like this more than Age of Steam or Brass. Maybe it "made more sense" or something, but I felt more of a sense of knowing what I was doing, and I felt like if I lost money I really did it to myself (rather than the game doing it to me). Maybe it's that the negative feedback tells me I did something wrong rather than the negative feedback telling me the game is "mean." Whatever it is, I'm liking Automobile a lot.

There is a lot stuffed into one small box.  Well designed, nice bits. I usually like Martin Wallace games, they all seem to have a certain level of complexity, and a good degree of theme and historical accuracy. I finally got to teach and play, and it really holds together well.  All espects of the game meld into the theme perfectly (except I wish all cars don't sell for exactly the same value ranges for the entire game.)  Everyone really enjoyed playing this game. I can't wait to try it again. Finally taught the game to Brian and Dave (they killed me! but seemed to like it).

A 3-5 player game that bears a modern setting when compared to most of Wallace’s releases. Players are competing in the U.S. auto industry in the early 20th century, purchasing factories that turn out low-, medium- and high-valued vehicles, starting with the 1893 Duryea and moving through history from there.

Automobile is a 3-5 player game that bears a modern setting when compared to most of Wallace’s releases. Players are competing in the U.S. auto industry in the early 20th century, purchasing factories that turn out low-, medium- and high-valued vehicles, starting with the 1893 Duryea and moving through history from there.

Each player knows a portion of the market demand each round and must make his purchasing and manufacturing decisions based on the information. Players can fund distributors across the country, but if they don’t supply distributors with vehicles to sell, they go bankrupt, taking your investment with them. Alternatively, players can drop the prices on their cars to move their market share, or even temporarily improve sales rates at the cost of research. Special action spaces are available that give a player a one-turn special ability with the actions provided by Ford, Durant, Kettering, and others some what related to their actual business history.

As newer models make their way onto the market, they sell at the expense of the older models. Older factories give inefficiency cubes as time passes, encouraging you to keep pace with technology.

To get money, you need to build cars with your factories, but if you build more than there is demand theylose not only the money spend to make them, but gain inefficiency cubes that hurt them for the rest of the game. Whoever manages their car factories the best over this 120-150 minute game will win.

I've played this only once, and that one time resulted in me getting thrown around like a rag doll by the system as I racked up losses after losses, and saw some turns in which I barely turned a profit.  I obviously can't say that I really grasp this game yet, but I will say that it seems like a good game, one that will reward repeated play.  There's all kinds of flourishes that bring out the theme,  though different personalities every round is definitely jarring.  The components are mostly good, though the there's an artistic flatness to the board that is a little disappointing.

So happy I got to play another Wallace game. Automobile is a tight economic game about manufacturing and selling cars. I can see what the winning strategy is though, which doesn't make this one something that will hold my interest log-term but I'd play it a lot more with strong players. The game is dependent on the skill of your opponents and what they do. I played with strong players the first time and went heavy into manufacturing the brown and silver cars but lost to the more expensive gold factories people had. I don't think the game can be won with high volume brown and silver car sales alone, unless no one goes into gold sales, which is unlikely. Love the turn order mechanic/specialty role selection at the beginning of each round as well. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Although less convoluted and fiddly than your typical Martin Wallace game, the flip side is that there seems to be less going on and room for strategic exploration is very limited; the game is fairly procedural and lacks dynamism. My concern is that the game among experienced players will come down to who guessed the demand right most often, i.e. who managed to sell the most with the fewest unsold cars left (and preferable to guess right early, as the extremely high value of liquidity basically makes this an economic snowball game). The partial knowledge of demand is a complete gimmick and could have been removed from the game or otherwise implemented better (e.g. allow you to also look at the demand tile belonging to the player on your left). Clearly the most interesting decision is what character to choose; from there decisions are generally obvious and largely uninteresting. This cements my view of Wallace as a designer with interesting ideas but a flawed sensibility. Even my favorite games of his I enjoy despite some detail or other that bothers me.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
After one play (hell, after one ROUND), I saw something incredible in the design, and after it was over, I wanted to talk about it, play it again, and try something different to see if I could do any better.  This is a tight, agonizing little game, played over 4 turns, for a total of 12 actions, and trying to decide when to do what is what gives the game its tension.  At first, I thought that the game might have a scripted start once players got to be familiar with the game, but I think the demand tiles, and the corollary loss cubes, will prevent that from being the case from turn two forward.  The economic engine is easy to see in this game, so it's easy to tell if you're making a profit, and in all honesty, it's likely that everyone will; the question is whether or not YOU can be more profitable than anyone else.  It's definitely a game that gives players lots of options, with a limited time to do them all, meaning that you will NEVER get to do everything you really want to do on a turn.  It's tight, agonizing, and interesting, but if you're going to play with 3 players, you might want to doctor the executive decision chart, since it seems too easy for players to get a hold of the bonus sale markers.  What can I say?  It's Wallace at his best.

I really enjoy this game. Theme works well and you really constantly wonder what the competition will be doing with thier turn.  A bold move by them could force you into a auto sale which will minimize your losses as well as your profit.  Good bits exept the paper money. Board is a bit cluttered and I feel that it could have used a side board for the car prices and production as well as where to put the demand tiles.  I think that would have cleaned up the board quite a bit.

Great game.  Same weight as Power Grid.  Lots of decisions and lots of guessing what others will do.  We played first game pretty conservatively.  I think future games will see us keeping factories open longer and pressing the production envelope further.

Played again twice.  Game is better with more aggressive play.  However, I don't like it as much with 3 or 4 players, because there just isn't as much tension.  You just aren't being driven to do things nearly as much as with 5.

I did a bit of playtesting for this. Definitely feels like a Wallace game. It's a passable economic game good for demonstrating the effects of supply and demand. One flaw is with the demand tiles: the information you get from them is really neither here nor there. I'd have preferred it if you could also see adjacent tiles, or just not bother with them at all. It's not something I'd play regularly, as games have felt similar to each other. There's not quite enough variety in it for me (the changes are subtle and mostly player-driven).

This game has several problems: 
 - If you make mistake at the beginning of the game, you're probably srewed, and you will be sitting for 2 or more hours without chances of winning. 
 -It's a think-about-everything, optimize-everything, count-everything game. You can play based on your intuition but it can be ok or no - if no - see my first sentence ;) 
  But when everything works out well as you planned it feels great. 
  Played once - half on intuition, half with calculations. I was second and I liked it a lot. 
  There is a lot of downtime which will kill you if you won't calculate during other people turns, or if you will count everything significantly faster then others.
  Nevertheless - a great game, which won't appeal to everyone. But it's worse than Brass ;) I'll play anytime if you'll ask me

My first play of this at Con of the North was really great.  I found the game flow to be really intuitive and the decisions about when to produce cars, build factories and close up and move on to be really tense and fun.  That being said, playing with AP folks and accountants has the potential to really make the game drag and suck the fun out of it.  I'm really looking forward to my next play all the same!

After playing and watching a few more times, I'm not happy with this game. Not being able to produce multiple times (Vehical CAP per location, not a production cap) There isn't enough going on in this game to keep my interest. 

I think the salesmen should be used in connection with a factory, so round robin around the board, people with more factories will use thier sales men more. R&D is a matter of money, I don't really get why they abstracted the research cubes.Just use the black cubes in the same way with. The only place this effects is the execuitive decission.

Much more approachable than Wallace's other designs of similar weight.  Automobile seems simple at first but after four rounds of play, you'll discover that there are much more strategy involved than what meets the eyes.  With the exception of the demands markers, everything else is open information so it is quite calculable, to a point, of what kind of purchases your opponents might make as well as the distributors they will be allocating.  My only concern for the game are the roles themselves, I find quite a few of them to grant rather useless powers and are only selected for the purpose of turn order.  I look forward to trying this again.

Otro muy buen juego de Wallace, más que interesante. Durito, pero no demasiado, y con una duración adecuada.

Bit of a steep learning curve.  One or two problematic ambiguities in the otherwise-excellent rulebook.

Really neat simulation of the evolution of the automobile industry.  Interesting implementation of several early auto industry luminaries as game features.

Beautifully balanced, Automobile is one of the best industry-themed game I know. The level of player interaction and its subtlety could hardly be more perfect. The game is beautiful to look at and setup takes just five minutes. Gameplay is easy to learn but the complexity of the economic simulation is impressive. A classic case of "easy to play, difficult to win". A Martin Wallace masterpiece.

A pretty well constructed euro that both theme-based players and eurogamers alike can enjoy.

at least 25 plays

I find the game somewhat traumatic, and thus my lower rating. It is an outstanding game.

I finally found a Wallace game that I really like!  Only problem is I don't like it as much as Outpost and it fills a similar niche.  Different enough that I'll keep it around though.  Outpost is better, but this has enough unique stuff that it's still cool.

Comparisons to Locomotive Werks are, in my opinion, somewhat valid.  I prefer this game's "you know some of the demand but not all of it" system to the "completely random" demand design of LW.  LW is a simpler mathematical exercise, however, while Automobile has other things going on.

You'd have to really love this bad boy to buy the deluxe edition at 120 USD though.

After 1 Play: Something about it seems off to me. I don't think really thin margins combine well with the random demand mechanic. I'd be willing to try it again to be sure.

Una gozada a cinco. Experimenta lo que es montar y desmontar fábricas echando a los trabajadores a la calle para ganar más dinero. No hay ética ninguna en sus acciones, se trata de ser mejor que nadie aprovechando lo que tienes, provocar las mejores circunstancias para tu industria y entorpecer la de los demás.

Only one play. Will likely rate it higher with more plays. Love the interaction between players, how every move influences the other.

What I don't like is the constant management and moving around of chits. It's one of those games where you think "this would be perfect for a computer game"...

Unlike Munchkin Treasure Hunt, Munchkin Zombies is incredible! It's probably the one board game I've spent the most playtime with (excluding Survivor). The game is both a card game and a board game (if you buy the Deluxe Edition like I did) which is really good for both card game or board game fans. Munchkin Zombies' equipment system is really fun and reminds me a lot of typical RPGs. What I think I liked most about Munchkin Zombies is that you actually play as a zombie vs playing as a Survivor, it's a really cool twist that doesn't happen often in zombie games.

Munchkin is a conundrum for me. On its own, it's not a very good game at all. However, it wreaks with theme. It's quite silly, and I've discovered that when played with the right people (ie like minded friends) it can be fun to play. It doesn't satisfy any gaming itches I have, but it does manage to be an entertaining activity in spite of that. I haven't played D&D (what Munchkin is themed after) in a very long time, but I can reminisce. But I love me some zombies, so when I saw Munchkin Zombies, I had to get it. Now if my friends want to play Munchkin, I at least get to play with Zombies. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
I don't find it quite as amusing as some of the other Munchkin titles, probably due to the oversaturation of zombies and zombie humor in the gamer culture right now, but it plays like Munchkin could: ridiculous, often frustrating, meant with beer and pretzels and good friends who can take the piss out of one another without giving a shit about how stylish the mechanics are.

Munchkin is a game with pretty lackluster mechanics and somewhat good themes than can provide some social fun. A "beer & pizza" game. It can be said that every game is fun with a group of fun people but this game in particuar is strong in this sentance. If you will try to play it with more serious boardgame group you will find it's lacking A LOT in pretty much everything.
As for the zombie version itself. It's one of the worst Munchkins I've played. Beeing brutally honest I regret buying it. The base, fantasy one is probably the best.

Merry Christmas to me! My wife surprised me by picking up Munchkin and Munchkin Zombie for Christmas. She beat me 2 out of 3 Christmas night, but I see a rematch in our future soon. Even better, she thinks we should go track down the five booster packs it would take to get a "free" card based on the mail in offer that ends at the end of the month. Excellent!

Otherwise known as Munchkin:  Make a bunch of crappy expansions, good for exactly one laugh in a game that should be ten minutes expanded into untold hours of torture wishing that you had the +2 rapier of suicide so you could kill yourself an get it over with all ready!

Said Game will make Steve Jackson Games a bazillion Munchkin Gold pieces off of a really boring, looong, and repetitive game, sold to gamers too brain dead from playing this stupid game to know better than to buy more crappy expansions with the same jokes rehashed over and over and over.

It's Munchkin.  If you don't know Munchkin by now, pick up any one of them, prepare to hate all of your close friends, and have some fun betraying each other.  This feels the most "pure" variant of Munchkin since it has just the Mojo instead of classes and races, which levels the field somewhat.  I find the zombies variant to have a few too many "add-ons" to your class.

I played this for the first time after playing Munchkin Quest a fair amount, and being essentially the same game but without the variety that the modular board brings, this and other card-based versions of this game feel pretty weak.

I would rather have been fighting the different zombie types as a human, rather than playing as a zombie trying to eat people, because the enemies are quite uninteresting for the most part (tax accountants, firefighters, etc.).

Still, it mostly plays the same, and the artwork is a little improved (or at least the shading).

My coworker bought this for me years ago, before I had played any Munchkin.  I really liked it and still do.

Ho già altri giochi di Munchkin e la meccanica non ha nulla di nuovo, è il tema a stravolgere un po' il tutto. Di fatto, si è Zombi e gli Zombi hanno bisogno di cervelli... per questo sarà necessario cibarsi dei "poveri" e "indifesi" umani nascosti nel mazzo delle porte. La versione italiana contiene anche la prima espansione e alcune carte promo per un totale di circa 280 carte. A differenza delle altre versioni che possiedo questa NON si presta al gioco tra due giocatori ma devono essere almeno in tre.

Another fun addition to the Munchkin series of games. This one brings back powers but mostly focuses on thematic references. The game balance is tweaked in favor of the players versus the humans, which I think is in line with the theme and tends to make for a faster game than other versions. I'm still deciding whether that's a good or bad thing, but my gaming group prefers the game to run shorter.

Lots and lots of good memories with Munchkin (regular, Zombies, and others). Before I played lots of other games, my rating would have been better, but Munchkin will always remind me of late game nights with college buddies, and backstabbing each other. We rarely play it anymore, as we have moved on to better games that accomplish what munchkin does in a shorter time and with more universal appeal, but it is still fun to take out every once in a while.

I got the game because I love RPGs, and a lot of people have raved about Munchkin being amazing; especially for the tongue-in-cheek humour regarding RPGs. I picked up the Zombies edition, because I love anything to do with Zombies. Unfortunately, I've realised since then that Munchkin really isn't my kind of game. I don't know why, but every time I've played it just doesn't give me the joy of playing like other games do.
Willing to trade to someone whom will enjoy this much more than I do.

In a reversal of roles, all players start out as zombies, and the "monsters" are the normal people trying to stop the zombie invasion (such as the Action Hero, Soccer Mom, Fireman, etc.). Unlike most Munchkin games, there are no classes or races; instead, you can have a mojo: Atomic Zombie, Plague Zombie, and Voodoo Zombie. As with Munchkin Bites! and Super Munchkin, there are powers--special abilities that you can play as you gain levels.

Guest artist is Alex Fernandez, who drew the Meals on Wheels card.

Part of the Munchkin series.

Still Munchkin..  Although it pairs extremely well with Munchkin Bites, the vampire/Worlds of Darkness themed deck.  Since Zombies allows for any "Undead" card to be played another, it creates one hell of a battle at times since some of the monsters in Bites are undead as well.

It's really fun if you like munchkin... It's really funny to see the combinatios when someone is trying to stop other player from wining, like: it's a babysitter, with a shotgun, on a bulldoser, distracted by a smily face.

Other than that is a really simplistic game, more to the side of party game than anything else.

This was a fun munchkin variant. I was not a fan of the  "Powers" as it seemed to confuse everyone on what they could or could not do. Besides that the mechanics stay true to the munchkin MO and that is a sure fire gold medal design. I'd recommend Almost any other Munchkin version besides this one, if you really want it go for it but if not then just grab any other one and have the near same experience just minus the "powers" mechanic.

Nice variation from the original, sadly doesn't include a board with tokens like the original.

Played this with a group that included a friend who hated the game, as the only other time that he played Munchkin, the other players screwed him over big time. So we convinced him to play, reluctantly, and one of the players, purposely screwed him over again, making him stay away forever. Not Fun.

I fell into the trap of thinking Munchkin was worthwhile when new to the hobby - Wasted a bunch of money on expansions in a short amount of time then realized I just wasn't enjoying the game (And more content wasn't fixing the problem past a couple of giggles when it came up).

I think its' a nice gateway for people, but I don't want to play this again - Hit the leader till everyone runs out of dickery and someone wins, which could take 30 minutes or 2 hours, bleurgh.

It may be sick and wrong, but seeing sections labeled "Want Parts" and "Has Parts" in the info for my copy of this game strikes me as very funny.  Clearly I need to get out more.  This is pretty much your standard Munchkin game; if you don't like them, you probably won't like this one any better than the others.  That said, I like the concept of the players taking on the role of zombies and fighting the humans.  The humor and artwork are all up to Munchkin par.  Fun stuff!

RATING: 8
It's another Munchkin game with a Zombie theme. It still gets an 8 because Munchkin is an amazingly comical game to play; especially with new players. However, I do feel there is a lack of imagination in actually changing the structure or feel of the game, which if you have several Munchkin games, can start to feel a little weak because the game becomes the same version and gameplay with some new skin. It gets a little old after a while.

B-Sieged is an epic adventure. I did not have much previous experience with this type of (castle defense, miniature, dice-heavy) game, but found it easy to learn and intuitive to play. 

We played a 3-player game (two heroes per player), and I enjoyed the variety of choices on each turn. I loved the just-right mix of "Oh my god we're all gonna die!!!" and "No worries guys, we got this." Also, the blend of planning/strategizing and random-dice-rolling felt perfect to me. 

The catapult was a ton of fun. Watching the monsters pile up and then get decimated was a ton of fun. Ducking out of the way of the oncoming assault (and thumbing our noses at the monsters) was a ton of fun.  Three hours went by in a hurry. Did I mention this game is FUN?

Very misrated game by some reviewers. Yes, there is luck in the game but Team play is crucial here. Do not block spots for other Players (especially the catapult), use the resource cards and gear up for the hordes of the abyss.

We play without the FAQ patches, so we play on hardest difficulty with respawning avatar etc.

The game has tension, great teamwork with lots of communication. 

Please ignore the reviews that say that this game is broken etc. It is not. You have to learn the gameplay and inner strategy to beat it.

Great game for castle defense fans.

Divertidisimo tower defense en el que tenemos que combinar la gestion de recursos para intentar aumentar de nivel, conseguir cartas, ... con los ataques para limpiar el mapa de hordas de enemigos.

Todo ello con un increible aspecto en mesa tanto por las espectaculares miniaturas como por el arte de Enrique Fernandez.

2016  Second impressions - with the FAQ the rules have been cleared up and game difficulty options provided. Is it a brilliant game?  No.  Does it have some balance issues, and can a flip of a messenger return card bear a huge factor in your chances to win?  Yes.  Does it have nice minis, play quick, offer a variety of heroes (with KS content), and have a real sense of drama as the baddies march relentlessly to your castle?  Yes.  I am enjoying this game, and will keep it until a better castle defense game comes along to replace it.

This kind of game is why I am losing my taste for co-ops. There is some strategy to how the enemies attack. That and the great looking minis are it's only saving grace. Otherwise, everything is just piling up on the players to see how quickly they can lose.

A good co-op is one where in the beginning the payers lose more often than they win but, after time, end up winning more often than they lose. After one play I feel safe saying that this is not one of those. If that changes than I will change my stance, but I have to see it to believe it.

Szerencsére a kickstarteres verziót sikerült beszereznünk, a sok sok extra hőssel, így még ki se tudtok próbálni mindet pedig már sok játékunk van benne. A legnehezebben nyerhető játék számunkra, ezért bátran ajánlom azoknak akik imádnak veszteni :D. A játék nehézsége nagyrészt a kockáknak is köszönhető, ezért a kockafóbiások inkább keressenek valami más kihívást (pl.: téboly nagykönve). Számunkra nagy plusz pont, hogy a hősök fejlődhetnek így új képességekre tesznek szert.

This is undeveloped garbage! The rule book is terrible. The game out of the box is junk. I left it up for 3 days, read FAQs and forums to learn how to play. They made attempts to "fix" it. It should have been fun streamlined dice rolling monster killing good time. Instead it is a bloated fiddly mess of a game. Did they play test this? Out of the box is not fun at all. It needs House rules to remotely make the experience enjoyable!
I either get rid of the game or develope the game! 
So far my house rules are any amount of players can be in a space except the catapult....still only one.
The food payment is junk. I spend actions to obtain food. To just give up food at the end of the season... if the really wanted a mechanic to waste my actions....they should have just given me less actions.
Out of my collection!

Kickstarter Backer. Defender Pledge, Darkness & Fury Expansion, Encampment Tile Set.
B-Sieged is styled to look like a fun, light dice-chugging co-op. 
What's under the hood is a high-difficulty,too long, too random and setup-intensive exercise in Statistics and Action Management. There is no storytelling to speak of and in the end, the split between look and mechanics is just too large for me to feel engaged in the Game. Not a total stinker, but there are better co-ops to play in the same timeframe.

This comment takes the FAQ into account

this game has gotten a ton of play time. honestly one of our favorite coops.  we okay with the updated rules and no house rules to speak of.  Having all of the KS content gives us lots to choose from and has kept it from getting old.  

biggest complaints - not knowing what we'll get in the cards and can feel like it runs long especially if on either end of the winning spectrum

Played once with Golden Axe, as it was owned by the guy who ran that group. I don't like miniatures, I don't much like dice, and I really don't like one of the people I was playing with. That compounded an already dull game which is trying to balance out poor mechanics with making the box heavier and heavier and so I originally rated this as a 2, based on my enjoyment in comparison to the rest of my scores. I then got the following childish message via BGG from the very thin-skinned designer: "Ey David, We dont understand why you play games with minis and dice (like B-Sieged) and after that, you rate the game with a very destroyer note. Thanks for hurt us." I therefore have reduced the score to a 1, because that's utterly terrible behaviour from a wannabe game designer... it's passive-agressive and rude to say "thanks for hurt[ing] us" to someone who took the time to play your game!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Played the demo at Gen Con. Basically, an epic version of Castle Panic. Great miniatures, love that it can play 6 players, and like that the difficulty makes it feel like an epic game. However, I found the dice mechanics decided the game a lot more than the strategy seemed to, and a few mechanics led to high irritation factor. I was playing a character whose special ability was to get a weapon for free each round. However, there were only four weapons I was able to draw from the deck, and the three that I pulled were all one time use siege weapons that I did not have the resources to use. I felt like I wasted lots of actions and time. I can also see the mechanic of certain "rooms" in the building getting broken over and over because a certain enemy was throwing rocks from the first row being an irritation as well. I felt like it was a game that is only beatable when all of the cards and the dice fall just right, literally.

B-Sieged is simply a fabulous, immersive game of tension and suspense. It is not a game for the faint hearted. I am, and will remain an abiding and RABID fan. The experience you'll gain is one of the most entertaining ways of failing-to-win you'll ever have. And when you do win (It happens!), the unadulterated joy ... sigh.

So far my win rate has been pathetic. The FAQ that was released shortly after the game's release is a must and begs the question on why this stuff wasn't included in the core game to begin with. The game is random and favors the attacker - It's just not possible to take out more than what comes out each turn which is fine because that's what makes it what it is, that you're hanging on by a thread at the time the messenger arrives. This falls into the purely solo game category for me though. I'm not a big co-op as a multiplayer game fan. So that means I should get a good number of plays. The biggest factor so far though seems to be efficient planning and making sure characters don't end their turn blocking key buildings. Planning as well as judging when is the most opportune time to use a resource - I've lost a few games because I either forgot about an upgrade or forgot someone needed something and went out of order. The game isn't really forgiving if you're not efficient and master the timing. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Pre-FAQ I would give this game a 1.  Post FAQ it gets a 4.  It's still weak for a strategy game because you give up a lot of certainty in planning. Any mistake in this game is fatal at tougher difficulties, and a lot of times you almost feel like you are playing a game of statistics to give yourself the best chance, and sometimes it works, mostly it doesn't.

This just isn't a great deal of fun, it has the "roll for everything" feel of Mice and Mystics, with the unforgiving dice rolls of Space Hulk Death Angel. For solo play I'd tag this a 4, but if you really want a compelling Tower defense game, the gold standard is Castle Panic with Wizards Tower expansion. 

I got this on the cheap for $45 brand new, I wouldn't pay anywhere near normal OLGS prices, even Miniature Market which has this in the clearance section for $60.00 perpetually.

Simple mechanics, Hard as hell but lots and lots of fun. We almost win, the messenger in his return was died in front of the northern wall, no time to send another messenger. The ambience created by the game was absolutely awesome, the increasing troops approaching generate a fantastic stress sensation.

Obviously there are some luck, like thousands of board games, but if you prepare yourself (with cards, and DIVINE GRACE tokens) you can mitigate it. This luck make some dice rolls… EPIC.

The minis are fantastic and the art is even better, the icons are simply and easy to learn.

Probably we not win in our next games, but it worth to try.

RATING: 7
After our first game of B-Sieged I'm going to tentatively give it a 7.  Sadly my first thoughts on the game are how to house rule it to make it a great game...  Which isn't really a good start to a game.  There is a lot going on and I think there is a good game in there, but for the moment I am a bit disappointed.  I do think the errata and FAQ fix some things, but not everything.  For example...  Summoning the avatar or a pile of artillery monsters on turn one can end the game before it begins.

Edit: just played again with errata + some house rules and it was a lot better.

As usual with CMoN games this one is a bit clunky and unintuitive, however I can see the potential.
The combat doesn't really seem to work at all, so much so that I have assumed we MUST have missed a rule somewhere.

I really enjoy this game. Strategies that work for other coops don't work for this game which makes this game difficult the first few plays. The game is also overall difficult for a coop board game. I think it's great for 2 people and will probably play it often. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.5
Gorgeous but incredibly random. It's basically a game that comes down to the card draws and dice rolls - 6 artillery monsters come out on the first round? Congratulations, you just died and there's nothing you can do about it.

Characters are not balanced. Choose a party of weak characters (you won't know who's weak until you've played a bunch of games) and you will lose. Take a strong character and he can win the game single-handedly (happened to us).

Way too slow and fiddly for this amount of randomness. If it wasn't for the minis and art I'd rate this a 3.

Sok, sokfelé lehúzták, emiatt nagyon tartottam tőle, de kifejezetten kellemes csalódás lett. Izgalmas, kiélezett játékmenet, pont ahogy egy cooptól elvárható. Arra figyelni kell, hogy az alapszabályokkal megcsinálhatatlanul nehéz, de az 1.1-ben már van skálázási lehetőség, amivel nagyon ajánlott élni, sőt a legkönnyebbtől kezdeni.
Bőven vannak nehéz döntések menet közben, és néha muszáj reszkírozni, nem lehet kieurózni az egészet, mint egy pandemicben. Illetve a kártyákkal azért ott is meg lehet azért szívni egy-egy kieurózást. :) Na, itt a kockadobás minden lépésedet befolyásolja, de némileg tervezhetően azért. No nem egyesével, hanem nagy átlagban. A sok mini miatt szükségszerűen sok időt vesz igénybe a pakolgatás, setup, ami sose jó, de 100+ mini esetén nem tartom elkerülhetőnek.

A tough nut to crack, both in terms of gameplay difficulty and scoring on BGG.

As is, game is very hard and quite fun however at the same time, it has some absurd mechanics that have no sense, except making games harder (e.g. rolling for moving catapult).

I feel that this game could be so much better with some rules tweaks.

There's a good game in here, hidden behind a really bad rulebook with unclear rules and no real way of adjusting difficulty where you're just at the mercy of dice rolls.

Only somewhat alleviated by errata.

After a couple of plays the consistent strategy to win seems to come down to playing a game of musical chairs on the catapult and your catapult management skills more so than anything else. Your characters tend to feel very weak throughout the game and leveling and finding gear doesn't really help all that much sometimes. Felt like the only good time to sit on the castle walls was to absorb some damage instead of letting buildings go down.

One odd quirk in the game has to do with strength. If you equip a weapon the strength value of that weapon overrides the strength value you have which in most scenarios makes getting + Strength on your level ups almost completely useless.

Nos... Kezdjük azzal, hogy amennyiben nem kooperatív játékról lenne szó, borzasztónak és elfogadhatatlannak tartanám. Így viszont elfogadhatónak tűnik.

Azt hiszem, hogy alapvetően azzal van a baj, hogy számomra nehezen tolerálható az előkészülési idő/játékszabály mennyisége/kontroll aránya. Ugyanis nem kevés idő a ki- és elpakolás, emellett maga a jatékidő sem kevés. Meglepően sok szabály van a játék egyszerűségéhez képest, emellett pedig olyan rengeteg választási lehetőség nincs.

Tower defense jellegű társas ez, ahol mindenféle szörnyszülöttől próbáljuk megvédeni a várunkat. Minden véletlenszerű, az események, a felbukkanó szörnyek helyszíne, mennyisége, és természetesen a védők támadásai. Egy futárt kell kijuttatnunk a várból, majd vissza is kell hozni. Kalandozóinkat fejleszthetjük, de alapvetően mégis leginkább az élelemmel és a támadásokkal kell foglalkozni. Erre sajnos nincs túl sok időnk, mert bár jó lenne tápolni, de közben olyan ütemben jönnek az ostromlók, hogy esélytelen igazán felkészülni rájuk. Sajnos sok sorsdöntő dolog kockával dől el, melyeknek a módosítása rendkívül korlátozott. Ráadásul néha a vásárlásokkal is be lehet fürödni.

Nem valószínű, hogy játszanék vele újra, de azt azért nem mondanám, hogy sohasem. Legalább szépek mind a grafikák,  mind a minik...

Feb 2017:  I just got this game and have played it once (4 characters). I was very wary of buying an expensive game that has so many "It's so random and your actions don't matter" reviews. I own Ghost Stories and love it but I really wanted a more "encroaching hordes" feel than GS (an amazing game) provides. I also wanted levelling up, and other stuff. I've played [thing=145493][/thing] and really liked that game, but it was much too fiddly to keep around. I still miss it but setting up each wave was such a bear! Nothing else out there really cuts the mustard for this kind of gameplay.

I am a pretty diverse gamer. I love Euros (Caylus, Agricola, Troyes, Through the Ages are some of my favorites), I love 4X, love 3X (Cyclades and Mare Nostrum :D), wargames, you name it. Ameritrash is probably bottom of my list but sometimes you want to kill a swath of miniatures with a roll of the dice. I do love some Ameritrash games; the Gears of War boardgame comes immediately to mind. Also a huge fan of Descent with the app.

I heard the FAQ improved B-Sieged so took a giant leap.

I think that many of the complaints about randomness stem from the resource card decks. When you want an upgrade and draw an armory card, getting something useless that you can't store (or worse), you're going to feel like it's a frustrating and random game. Luckily, I happened across this amazing guide: [thread=1528934][/thread]. 

Now, I love exploring strategies in various games and inching my way to victory. Unfortunately, the resource decks don't allow one such luxury. If you play them incorrectly, you will lose. 

It's completely understandable that a seasoned gamer will visit the Armory on his/her first turn so they can have a buff for the rest of the game. Unfortunately, in this game that is among the dumbest things a player can do. No, going in with a good knowledge of the risks of drawing from a given deck is key to victory.

Now, I lost :D On the easiest level (from the updated rulebook). But I never felt like I was a ship being tossed about the ocean, helplessly thrown where Poseidon's whims took me. No, I felt like I was really fighting back and being a thorn in the Abyss's side. 

Once you know this, the houserules I have seen don't appear necessary. Allowing two heroes on one building? A good chunk of the strategy is doing yoour actions in an order where you leave high-demand buildings (or the catapult) free for others! 

Anyhow, that was longwinded and should probably be in the Reviews section. In short: I am someone who doesn't enjoy randomness (I actually have found Zombicide to be quite dull with a lack of interesting decisions), but I loved this game for releasing some steam

Giving this game a hopeful six.  Heard the rumors it was too brutal before buying, but looked at this as an opportunity to work on creating balanced house rules while waiting for corrections from the publisher.  Hope to have a higher rating on the other side, but in either case do not regret the purchase.

RATING: 1
Seems that it was not playtested much. Every choise you make involves luck of the draw or dice. The board quickly becomes a mess of plastic by just adding more and more figures of enemies. Meaningless and limited choices for the players as each turn you have less spaces to activate either because another player blocks a building or the building is destroyed. If you don't have enough bread for your hero to eat at the end of each season, he is dead which is quite unthematic.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
It had so much potential. I really thought it could replace or at least give some variety over Ghost Stories. But while in GH you rave some randomness, in B-Sieged  EVERYTHING depends on your luck. You want some cards? Random. You need to attack? Random. You want to use or move the catapult? Random. The time when the final boss appears? Random. Your powers? Random. To be fair, you can move without rolling. And that's it.

Of course, after playing a few times, you will manage to win this game - even if by just lowering the difficulty. Even so, you'll feel disappointed too many times during the game because of random events which you cannot control and against which you cannot prepare.

RATING: 9.8
I was a little reticent about trying out B-Sieged because I had seen reviews which claimed that the game was too luck-dependent. However, I then saw some other reviews which rated the game very high because of its toughness, theme integration and design.
I am happy I finally tried it out and have played it quite a few times now. There is a minimal luck factor in the dice rolls, of course, but the game is all about planning and getting prepared. Hard choices all the way and the cooperative nature of the game makes for a fun experience in the group (if your group can take it). 
The great design of game and miniatures is a plus, but I like the game for its gameplay experience, a real tough challenge....  this game seems to be extraordinary in the sense that it has a lot of haters and a lot of lovers. I surely count myself as one of the latter.

RATING: 4
A slick produced tower defense style coop game, which sadly shipped with a mess of a rulebook and in serious need of repairs.  The base game is also a mess in that it relied heavily on player luck.  Strategy elements are pretty poor here since even the best laid plans, are all going to be hinged upon how lucky everyone is.

Excellent mini's ...crap player matts ...far too thin ...but typical production from this ripoff company ...whose style seems to override substance ...but I like their games ...so I put up with it ...

But thicker play mats and a thicker board for the cards decks to be placed on ...

Version 1.1 sorts out a few issues about the game ...

I really don't their KS model ...so I doudt after purchasing Zombiecide Black Plague I will be investing anymore in this company ...as I feel retail versions of their games play too much second fiddle to KS buyers ...

Not everyone can afford to invest in KS ...

My friend has this and our group occasionally plays. It's absolutely outstanding. Tons of people complain about how hard it is, but clearly they need to do a better job with communication and teamwork. 

The monsters are tough and you're always on your toes with the dice rolls, especially with the risk of the avatar.
Do I have enough time to visit the shop before I take out the demons? Or maybe I should go to the catapult. But then, it takes an action to move the catapult; maybe I should move it for the next person and then visit the shop, or just deal with the demons coming up on this side to take away the threat....      Everyone's thinking this and discussing all at once. It's an incredible and memorable experience.
This game demands teamwork and talking to beat it, which is excellent, because that's thematically how this kind of situation would play out. People rate it lower because it's hard, which is extremely unfair for such a fantastic game that makes you think. 

Bottom line, if you like board games that require you to use your brain and have an awesome time, then this is the game for you. If you just want to sit there and play out your turn, and don't like a challenge, then maybe Scrabble or Sushi Go is where you should stay :P

I'll admit it...I am a sucker for big sprawling cooperative games with fantastic artwork and tons of miniatures.  I will concede that all these things in a game can sometimes take precedent over gameplay.  B-Sieged is such a game.  Reviews for it have been very mediocre to down right excoriating.  Complaints were it's impossible level of difficulty and it's heavy...I mean HEAVY luck factor.  CMON released an addendum shortly after the game itself was released to mitigate some of these complaints, but that didn't seem to sway many people.  But I really like B-Sieged.  First, the theme.  It is a tower defense game with players defending the central citadel from waves of creatures crawling out of cracks in the landscape.  These monsters hurl rocks, breath fire, and swing swords.  On your turn there is a ton of choices from standing your ground and taking out these minions from the wall, to using the citadel's central catapult, to upgrading your charcter at various locations inside the citadel.  The theme is midieval fantasy with knights, wizards, etc - and who doesn't like that.  You lose if any of the minions reach the citadel from any of the four sides in addition you must send a messenger from the citadel off the board and have him return again without getting killed.  The miniatures and artwork are SUPERB and the game is a lot of fun despite it's difficulty.  I would recommend using the rule changes suggested in the addendum.  But man, this is fun to play.

The rule book is cumbersome/poorly edited, and lacks some rather basic, key information.  The game is difficult, yes, but more relevant is that it is trying/frustrating.  Winning is not mandatory for fun, however some mechanics of the game seem for the sole purpose of frustration, adding nothing to game play. The game is very much at the mercy of the cards & dice, and the Messenger concept/mechanic seems tacked on.  The miniatures are nice, however the adversaries one faces have little variety, and quickly become repetitive.  Does not feel a good return on one's investment of time, nor money.  Disappointing

I was looking for a miniature game that were different and I found this. A castle defense game with different mechanics and a graphics that I liked. Hoping to have it at home.

Edit: After my second play, both played with two players, I must change my rating 1 point up. We win at our 2th play in Footman difficulty mode and the feeling is that we could try it harder. I really enjoyed it most than our first play... So I'm pretty happy with this game.

The quality of the components it's great  and the minis ask to be painted (when having time) for sure. With the Kickstarter extras it is needed the extra box to store it all.

Random.  Slow.  Boring.  Anticlimactic.  Too many rules.

The game doesn't feel finished.  There are a few choices that sound interesting, until you realize that they are made before you know key information, so they are essentially random.  So, you end up just going through the motions.

Worst of all, the game's ending is extremely anticlimactic.  Win or lose, it is usually obvious what the outcome will be long before the game ends.

Many rules serve no purpose either thematically or strategically.  The game really feels unfinished -- like it was rushed out the door as soon as they got it to function, without stopping to think if it was balanced, fun, or interesting.

Up until this game, I thought that CoolMini was showing that kickstarter games really can be well developed.  Now they look like they are falling into the pattern of adding cool minis to an incomplete game and calling it done.

The rulebook is technically complete, but only if you read it several times.  Stuff is poorly ordered, and some key rules have to be inferred from strategic advance and examples.  It could have been a concise rulebook, but it's not.  Worse, the iconography in the game is incomplete - several rules (like what the 6 different smuggler results are, or where you go to level up, or which monsters attack multiple targets) have no representation on the board at all.  Key things you need to reference every turn are buried in the rulebook.  So, the game wastes your time on top of everything else.

If the game were faster, it might be a 5/10, but it would need an overhaul of the supporting mechanics to make it any better.  I honestly can't think of what type of person or gamer would actually enjoy the game.  It's not atrocious, but it's sub-par on every front.

I like the game and concept.  The board and minatures are superb.  However, the game is excruciatingly difficult on regular mode and requires a lot of house rules to make it fun and not overwhelmingly tough.  With the house rules, that are still being tested, I would bump it up to a 6 or 7 but a game of this type and cost should require this much tinkering to make it playable.

I really enjoy this tower defense game. It's a hard one to beat that's for sure. Yes, there are some questionable design choices (like having to roll on top of using an action to rotate the catapult), but nothing that cannot be addressed with a minor house rule or two aimed at reducing the RNG.

Mixed opinions. I like the siege feeling and the leveling up and upgrade options. On the downside, the game is both very hard and very random. There's often very little you can do to actually fight the monsters; you must simply hope to draw the right cards to stave off the key attacks and try to avoid the dangerous zones. Not sure I'm ready to get rid of it yet, but in retrospect I shouldn't have bothered backing it.

House Rule:
Sanctuary allows you to BOTH gain food/star AND level up in one visit. Leveling up is a lot of fun, so we like the option to do more of it.

Outstanding tower defense game, the best on the market, even better than Ghost Stories. 

B-Sieged didn't make it off the starting blocks thanks to the Dice Tower review. Sadly the game was too hard for them, so the game sucked, not them, the game.

No strategy needed in this game apparently, just blind luck. Keep telling yourself that if it makes you feel better.

If you enjoy the challenge and strategy, yes strategy! of Ghost Stories, good chance you will also like B-Sieged. 

For all the cry babies, how about another game of Pandemic maybe? Then all you have to do is pull up chair and you automatically win! High fives all round!

A lot of issues here. The game can drag on and on, the amount of randomness is frustratingly high, the messenger mechanic has a lot of problems, and it is evident that the game is underdeveloped because they issued a number of rules updates shortly after the game shipped.

As usual for CMON, the production values are great but the gameplay is severely lacking.

This is a really challenging but fun co-operative game. High fives and fist bumps abound as you pull off that last minute, desperate attack which stops the enemy overrunning the walls or you manage to knock out those support units about to kill your messenger! 
I love tower defence games and this is much better than Castle Panic. Lots of decisions to make throughout involving levelling up, tooling up and dishing out vengeance on the attacking hordes! Hugely under-rated game in our opinion! Just ensure you download the latest rule book or the excellent Universal Head play summary in the file section.

Update: We enjoyed this game so much that, after 5 plays, I bought the expansion and the extra hero set. Then I painted the heroes and the Kickstarter plastic tokens. Then bought a foam insert. Yep, fairly Besotted with B-Sieged!

Határozottan nem az én játékom, pedig szeretem a koop mókát és a tower defense-szel is barátok vagyunk. Itt viszont kevés az akció, egyformák a karakterek és semmi izgalom nincs. A hősökkel nem lehet azonosulni, ráadásul tényleg minimális eltérés van a "képességekben", és ezen képességek sem közvetve a játékot viszik előre, hanem csak minimálisan megkönnyítik a te boldogulásod (és ezáltal persze a csapatét is, de tényleg alig észrevehetően). A karaktereket lehetne tápolni, de erre összesen egyszer volt lehetőségem a játék elején, utána már nem éri meg arra a helyre menni, mert különben sosem éred utol magad, annyira kevés az akció. Az ellenfelek ugyanis tucatnyian jönnek egy körben - ráadásul én meg egy kockával dobok a 3 akcióm egyikét "elpazarolva", h leszedjem őket egyesével... Amit nagyon hiányoltunk az egy "kockamódosító" lap v fegyver v akármi, esélytelen volt nekem így a játék. A minik persze rendben, de ettől még az ár/érték arány nagyon rossz.

Pretty straight-forward "manipulate the majorities" game with some clever thematic twists.  The scoring is neat and turns are quick.  +1 for kidnapping opponents into your trunk and dumping them in Lake Michigan.  -1 for the wretched graphic design.

Played on a giant board @ gencon 2014. This one was somewhat interesting. The theme is more or less pasted on, but still works (throwing bodies of rival gangsters into lake michigan is always a blast!). The interaction is interesting as well, two players can completely destroy each other if they get involved in too much conflict. The gambling mechanic doesn't change a ton either. Overall it felt a bit too long for what it offers, but still somewhat interesting.

RATING: 3
Played with five, which was bound to ramp up the chaos to maximum.  All the same, this struck me as a thinly themed area control game in which the play is highly repetetive and there is way too much randomness. Altogether a pretty joyless experience.

Very much a euro. The only real gangster aspect is the ability to dump cubes (people) off the dock. There are other pasted on thematic components, but the game is a little dry for my tastes.

RATING: 7
I really enjoy mobster games.  This one is good but almost feels like more of an exercise than a game at times.  I will play this any time it hits the table though.  More players means more fun with this game as well.  I would put it at a 4-5 player only game.  Otherwise there is just not enough player interaction and once someone takes the lead with a lower player count it becomes an offensive defensive game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
I really like the artwork for this game and the components are nice as well. I am never really quite sure whether I like area-control games or not. There are a couple scoring aspects of the game that make this unique as an area-control game, yet it still doesn't seem like a game that will keep me coming back all that often. Played a 3-player game and felt that there would be more tension with more players. This was true in a 4-player game, but ultimately the game dragged on too long for me.  I'd probably play this game more if it played in less time.

A big old "meh" for me.  Theme wasn't particularly compelling, and there was more chaos and kingmaking than I prefer in my area control games.  Not bad if everybody plays quickly, but slow players can REALLY make this one drag, 'cause there's not all that much to think about between turns.

RATING: 5
It drags on a little too long in a 5p game for what it is.  I also felt there was a little too much chaos with that many players.  It's enjoyable to dump people in the river, but do I really have enough control in order to win?  Or is is mostly luck.. I'm inclined to think that the luck factor is a bit too high in this one.  Perhaps I would enjoy it with fewer players.

You play a mob boss. You compete with your fellow bosses. Through careful placement of your “boys,” you control important locations throughout the city. But time is limited! Only three days remain for you to exert influence in the neighborhoods. Use these days wisely, because the gangster with the most influence at the end is proclaimed the boss of bosses! Beware! Your opponents seek the same raw glory. Take care, because if a gangster is invited down to the river for breakfast, he might not be around for supper!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
One of the many majority games. Some twists could be interesting, but the "take that" factor partially connected with the theme and the overall slow progression of the game make Gangster a rather boring and underwhelming experience.

Fun game.  Easy to learn, but difficult to master.

RATING: 7
A different and quite clever take on area control games, in that you not only place your workers (trigger men), you can pick up and drop off the other player's pieces as well, by placing them in the "trunk" of your "car". Couple that with a scoring mechanism that doesn't always reward the first place with the most points, and can change from game to game, makes for a pretty fine game.

This deserves more plays.

I've played this a few times now (3-not all recorded) and feel like this is a good basic area control game. For some people the theme comes through, it doesn't for me, but that's fine.

Won at auction in April of 2008. After two plays. This game has much going for it. Lots of things to do and ways to do them. Unusual thing about this game is that sometimes being 2nd or 3rd in an area scores higher than being first. You have to get used to that concept to play the game most efficiently..The more we play this game the better I like it and the higher its rating goes. Placing someones piece in a spot on the board that does them no good and forces them to either leave the piece there or spend time to go get it to put it somewhere else is a new strategy that I learned during the last game. It can be quite effective.

RATING: 6.5
I have been pleasantly surprised with Gangster.  It is a fast, fun, and exciting game that is easy to learn and play.  At first glance, some may moan that it is just another area control game.   That's true, but the scoring twists and ability to kidnap and relocate or eliminate opposing gangsters gives the game a fresh feel.  Competition for control of the districts is fierce, and control can change quickly.   There is quite a bit of maneuvering for desired positions, which more often than not results in dastardly kidnappings and a steady stream of visits to Lake Michigan!
 
A typical game of Gangster plays to completion in less than ninety minutes.   Player turns are lightning quick, and downtime is virtually non-existent.  Since control of districts can change rapidly, players must be ready to adapt their plans to take advantage of changing situations, or to counteract moves from opposing gangsters intent on muscling-in on one of your districts.   There is no resting on one's past achievements, as a successful gangster cannot afford to let his guard down. 
 
Gangster is one of the pleasant surprises from 2007's Spiel.   It won't be confused as a heavy "gamer's game", but rather finds a nice spot in my collection as a fun, light game that forces players to make continuous choices throughout.   It is a game that is easy to teach, and can be played competitively and enjoyed by a wide variety of people, both hobbyists and casual gamers alike.  As much as I enjoy the "meatier" games, Gangster is the type of game that will likely be played far more often as it is so easily accessible.   I enjoy the game's spirit and atmosphere, and the ability to dump my opponents into Lake Michigan is an added bonus!

It's a Gangster game so after Bootleggers had to grab this one and give it a try.
Once we got over figuring out the rules we had an amazingly enjoyable 5 player game of this.  Back stabbing and conniving and swimming with the fishes were the theme for the day.
A problem we do see with it was that the BodyGuard enhancement really isn't that useful when compared to the others.  We're thinking of adding a HouseRule to our next game making it work for adjacent areas as well.

RATING: 6
No glaring problems, but no real hook either. It feels rather dry and the theme doesn't really fit very well with what is happening in the game. There's really not enough choices to make, and the ones you do make will be thwarted, sometimes randomly, by other players. Too chaotic for my taste, but I can see how some would like it. Blue Moon City is scads better.

An area control game with the bizarro difference that doing the best in an area doesn't always mean you get the most points. The theme and art are well done, and dumping your enemies' gangsters in Lake Michigan is good for a laugh. I had a good time with it.

1 play only. At first my heart sank when this was tabled and I realised it was yet another example of a wooden cube area control game, but it has a few nice twists and it's actually pretty good fun. Worth an extra half point if you haven't played lots of other area control games (e.g. El Grande, Blue Moon City, Mission Red Planet, China, Liberté, Mykerinos, Maharaja etc)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Easy to play but hard to get in a strategic flow. Chaotic Gangsters are too hard to go with any set strategy as the lead changes often. Bought it 1/2 price with my discount coupon I won at Origins 2011. Sold it for $16 4/23/12.

I wanted to like this more, but just can't.  This is your typical area control game with a gangster theme (not much at that).  There really just seems to be something (or many) missing in this game.  Gangsters didn't just get involved in area control and pick up you opponent and throw him in the lake.  Where is the meat, the building of establishments for revenue, explotiation of innocence, racketeering, etc...  This is the game of gangsters I want to play.  Also, the cops play very little - I mean very little in this game - should be more to it.

Reminiscent of El Grande, it’s an area control game where you have a car full of gangsters and you cruise around moving gangsters in and out of different neighborhoods.

There is a bit more luck and chaos influencing the final result than I usually like but the light strategy combined with the theme are certainly entertaining. The game is even good for some laughs as players naturally choose to provide appropriate sound affects when tossing opponent’s gangsters into their trunk and subsequently dumping them in Lake Michigan.

We had some fun playing it. The theme come back well, kidnapping your rival gangster, throwing them into the back of your car. However, it takes too long for what it is. It is too chaotic for a serious tactical game. A very strong hit-the-leader effect. It reminded me of Eiszeit in that sense: it is smarter to end up second or a close third and then score optimally in the last round. Don't take the lead too soon, otherwise you get hit.

This should probably be a 5, but my friend Matt likes it so much I sort of feel bad ranking it as such.  So I'd say that it's a 5 if anyone else suggests it, but  a 6 if Matt suggests it.  There are a lot of games that suffer from this problems of really having very little way to stop others from screwing with your plans.  This makes it too chaotic for my tastes.

Quite a neat, though rather abstract, little game in which you push cubes around -- mostly your own, but also others -- in order to gain the correct ranks. What makes it interesting is that often not the first rank, but the second or third gets the most points, which makes it interesting trying to end up exactly in the correct position.

With too many players, it becomes a bit too unpredictable, though. I'd say three players is fine, four is okay, anything above has a randomness factor that should not be underrated.

If you try real hard you can convince yourself that this isn't just an abstract area control game.  I like a number of thinly themed games, and the special powers make this a bit more engaging, but at it's heart it just isn't as intriguing as the hundred area control games that came out before this.  

I think that the problem is two fold, one it is just too long for what it is. If you just play two rounds it doesn't detract from game play, in fact I think it would accentuate play.  The last round can really devolve into attacking a perceived leader.  The second, is that It is so much easier to unload your trunk in the lake than it is to make craftier decisions of unloading people in other districts.  This diffuses the decision making process and for me feels an unfortunate loss. If it were the reverse where you could unload your trunk after taking an action in any district vs having to take an extra action to take a player out of the game I would appreciate the design more.

Still, there is a good enough game here that I would have liked to have seen it as great as it could have been.  Perhaps if you just pull out two of the x2 markers and one of the cop cards?  This would keep the arc of the game the same, but abbreviate each round enough to keep it from feeling less repetitive.   Of course, if there were fewer turns and fewer multipliers that amplifies the luck factor of where the x2s get dropped...

Regardless, I want to like it.

As an aside, there is a silly design decision that irks me.  If you play the game and ask what the game's name is they will say "Chicago 1930."  Why? Because that is what is printed on the board instead of going with the title of the game.  Nice.

I like this game. It's nor brilliant but the theme is cool. It's a keeper.

Usually we have lots of fun playing it and that's a great thing to say about any game.

A simple and quite average tile-laying game. Has nothing to make it stand out from the crowd, except the high price tag. The wooden box and the bullets are nice and all, but for such a price, I expect to get more 'game' inside the box.

Single 3-player game. Area majority, but sometimes you want to come second or third rather than first. Quite thematic notion of travelling around in your car, dropping off your own henchmen and knocking out your opponents.

A nice area control game with a old-timey gangster theme. Lots of direct player interaction, but the wide-open map means that the interactions are a lot more diffused than the usual Take That game. Unfortunately, despite all the special abilities and so forth, the game feels bone dry. The map is simultaneously really boring and cluttered. Districts, players, and goons have very little character. At the end of the day it's just not that interesting.

Interesting little area control game, some nice scoring mechanics with the piece placement.  I couldn't help but feel there should be some minor victory point distribution for discarding bodies into the river, the movement it takes to go and possibly having to replace your upgrades with something you don't want makes a key aspect unappealing at times.  The cop should have more consequence too, I felt the "Cop" no special point doubling this turn thing to be lacking in theme and logic, they should have a consequence for drawing them.  All the upgrades are very good and have some great combinations, however the bodyguard seems to be entirely useless.  I enjoyed it but it could use more depth, its longer than it should be for what it is.

consider it an el grande variant.  how bad can that be?  the cards are gone, but there are some other (simpler) special angles thrown in, and the fact that majority isnt always the highest score for a neighborhood is a nice touch.

Throughout the 1920’s and 1930’s, rival gangsters compete in a life or death struggle for control of the gleaming city on the shores of Lake Michigan. Each district is hotly contested, because in the end there can be only one “King of Chicago!”

You play a mob boss. You compete with your fellow bosses. Through careful placement of your “boys,” you control important locations throughout the city. But time is limited! Only three days remain for you to exert influence in the neighborhoods. Use these days wisely, because the gangster with the most influence at the end is proclaimed the boss of bosses! Beware! Your opponents seek the same raw glory. Take care, because if a gangster is invited down to the river for breakfast, he might not be around for supper!

Gather up your boys, hop in the sedan, and see if you have the skill, the cunning, and the ruthlessness to become Chicago’s top Gangster!

Sadly, I found the game to be fairly pedestrian, with the theme just barely there. There are a lot of good area control games out there, and this one is just a mediocre entry in the group. The theme is interesting, and it works; but it doesn't have enough draw for me to really get into the game. I think that players who came across this game as their first entry into the realm of games that use area control would enjoy it, but the game went on a little too long and was just a bit boring for me. See my review for more details...

The possibility to drown your enemies in the sea. How cool is that!
The game is a looker. Very atmospheric drawings and nice colours of the cards, wooden pieces and of course the board. The game itself is a hybrid of majority euro and random take-that.

Not much new here.  Another area majority game, this one with some pick up and deliver mechanics and a twist that sometimes you get more points for placing second or third than you do for placing first.  Components are nice, and the noir twist is kinda cool, but the theming ultimately falls pretty flat when you realize that your gangsters might as well be farmers, or support cubes or any of a bunch of other options from better games out there, and all you're ultimately doing is trying to have better amounts of cubes than your opponents.  Not bad, but there are better gangster games, better pick-up-and-deliver games, and better area majority games out there.  Destined to be played once or twice and forgotten.

area control game with quiet nice theme, move your  jallopy full of  hooda about the city to deploy them in the various neighbourhoods to get control, the tricj is though that because of the random nature of teh  neighbourhood cards you dont score best for always haveing the most!

pick up other boss's hoods and dump them into  an adjacent neighbourhood aand your sinhgle mook migh just be enouhg for control!

fun and simple mechanics  but an awful lof of thinking involved!

In theory Gangster seemed clever at first glance.  There were numerous small decisions you have to take into account: plotting out the best route to the districts you want to move to so as not to make any suboptimal stops; how many thugs (i.e. cubes) to unload; whether or not it's worth it to put someone in your trunk and when to dump; making sure the round doesn't end prematurely as you are trying to carry your plan to completion.  There were definitely quite a bit to consider in this area majority game.

However, the execution was quite poor.  As most have noted, it played too long and too repetitive.  The special powers was an interesting touch, with some more useful than others, but I found it to be fairly inconsequential.  There was definitely a ganging up on the leader problem, so it pretty much behooved one to stay close without appearing to be threatening in order to make a last round surge.

In the end I suppose I'm sort of ambivalent to the design.  I liked it and yet I don't at the same time.  There were commendable parts about Gangster, but it was also kind of chaotic that the experience became less fun to partake in as the game went on.

Terrible! Prohibition game with no beer?!  No gangster meeples?! I like the map of Chicago and line art; but the insets of the box are horrible and do not fit the pieces properly.  I do not like how the backs of the cards are all the same so you cannot tell which card is which.  It is like El Grande in scoring/mechanic but the game itself does not feel like a gangster or mafia game -- its just filling up boxes with cubes.    Its criminal that a chicago prohibition game that has so much potential ended up being as bad as this. 

-- Buy El Grande instead and just imagine your a gangster.

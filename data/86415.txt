RATING: N/A
Similar to the Climbers and seems to work quite well, I would probably rather play this again than The Climbers as it also has a dexterity aspect and more player balance due to how colours are accessible to the players.

more complicated then Rummikub 3D and less streamlined. I have to find out yet which one I prefer.
Rummikub 3D is better (more tactic and choices), turmbauer is more beautiful.

RATING: 7
Faster version of Cornerstone.  A few substantial rule changes make this play out quite a bit differently, but it comes with fewer pieces.  If you are going to play 2 player, buy this.  Otherwise I would recommend the original.

After two plays I have to admit that I prefer Die Aufteiger over this because it provides more sense of freedom because doesn't depend on the dice rolls... both games are good and beautiful but this one is a little less engaging.

Waited so long to own Cornerstone after playing it originally.  Cornerstone Essential is a tiny let down with the epic towerness of the original, but still just tremendously fun.  I'll probably be trying to get a second set at some point.

This is just a crowd pleaser.

Cornerstone Essential is a nice dexterity game and a crowd-pleaser. I can always bring it out when there are some non gamers around and know, that it will be quite some fun. But I was also a little disappointed after my first plays because I expexted a little more "depth". There is no real blocking and if you don't force it, the tower will be quite stable throughout the game since it won't be that high. This results in close games where it often comes down to the luck of the dice who wins. This might change with more competition oriented players who try to win by building unstable towers, but I haven't seen this yet.

To sum it up: Cornerstone Essential is a fun dexterity game and I do have fun playing it. I just wish, there was a little more "depth" to it.

Cornerstone Essential looks like a full-blooded dexterity game but that is a bit of a false conclusion. It does have a dexterity element but due to the comparatively small number of building blocks and their fairly large size it is much less pronounced than in something like Bausack or Animal upon Animal, for example. Cornerstone, in contrast, is more about spatial awareness and placing your blocks in a way that ensures your own progress and inconveniences your opponents at the same time. In that way, it is quite similar to The Climbers, although the checkerboard requirement oddly makes it feel a little less constricted. The dice, however, can easily make up that difference.

Interesting semi-dexterity game.  Dice limits the tactical space somewhat, but rules are a little ambiguous.  Similar in play/feel to Die Aufsteiger/The Climbers, and even Rumis.  Fun for a few games.

Have two, so combining them creates the "original" Cornerstone.

I had no expectations for this, and was pleasantly surprised. A little dexterity, a little puzzle, a little tactical movement. A very pleasant diversion, and I'm sure non-gamers would get into this as well. Cool.

A weird mix of Santorini-style clambering, and a straight balancing game, which gets particularly tricky when you can't always see the internal structure of the tower any more. A little bit over-wrought with the dice rolling and special-move tokens, but enjoyable enough.

Dexterity game. Not bad, but not really good either.

RATING: 8
Fun mix of strategy, dexterity and luck. Strategy and dexterity parts are well balanced and using dice to decide which piece you need to add to the tower makes the game move along fast and keeps it from being too dry.

Somewhat random building game. Didn't hate, didn't love. Might play again, depending on mood.

Great tower-building and climbing game - the best one available? Enough luck, enough challenge. I bought couple of these so I can play the original Cornerstone as well...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Debating right now if this is different enough from The Climbers to acquire...

LIKES:

* Dexterity element in building the tower is excellent and can be quite tricky as the tower gets higher.  
* Two special action chits allow for potential bonus moves - generally the person who uses them the most wisely will win.
* Checkerboard rules provide a difficult twist to consider when building the tower.

DISLIKES:

* Uncertain how I feel about the pair of dice used to determine which pieces you can place.  The dice can mess you over pretty badly.  (If you don't have a piece with the number of squares of the numbers rolled, you discard a piece from the game).  Positive side here is that the game keeps moving quickly.

Great game, lots of fun, building the tower piece by piece. In my first game everyone was done, when I was about to put on my very last piece, jump on top and win, but then.... the tower tumbled down. Disaster.

RATING: 5
Decent fun once in a while, but not as good as I'd hoped. I guess this isn't my kind of game. Best when using all the pieces, so with two or four players. With three players the tower, while often rickety, is unlikely to fall, and without enough of that kind of tension, it's the game that falls flat. [4 plays; sold Jul'14]

Just like cornerstone, but with fewer pieces. I'm not sure I like all or the new rules, they can be a bit vague in places. The rule about not blocking someone's movement is too difficult to parse, since there are times when the use of the rule-breaking stones could allow a semi-blocking move. Anyway, I still prefer to just play with the original rules and have it be cut-throat. I also think that with fewer pieces, the tower falls far less, so I may spring for another set eventually.

I think with the fewer pieces, the game just doesn't compare to the original. I have yet to have a game end due to tower collapse. I think I may need to get a second copy to make the game more interesting.

I have been waiting for more than a year to get my hands on this game, and now I finally played it (twice)!
I have to admit that I am a little disappointed with the quality of all wooden components (very light and a little rough around the edges), but they are functional enough. The gameplay, however, is as much fun as I expected. Having to climb the tower with your meeple is a nice and original concept. Also, the game plays quickly and with little downtime.
UPDATE: After some more plays, I still think this is a very original game, but I do question its replayability. Luck (the dice) usually dictates a large part of the endgame.
UPDATE(2): When played with gamers who take pride in setting up an unstable tower the experience really improves!
UPDATE(3): Bought a second copy so I can play the original Cornerstone (no discs, building on floor level allowed and encasing other players allowed). That version is still the best.

A quick and engaging building game. The rules are simple, building the tower is fun, and skill can tip things in your favor. A great filler or gateway that appeals to many. Plays well with 2.

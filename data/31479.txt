Well, it's a puzzle.  It's on par with Sudoku.  It can be a bit addictive while in the middle of solving them (if you are indeed solving them), but when I pull back, it's harder for me to want to start doing it.

It is a more difficult version of Ubongo. I don't know if I particularly liked it more or less than the original game, probably a little bit less, because very often I couldn't make the patterns and it was very challenging for me. But overall the game feels like the same.

Its like the basic Ubongo with a few changes. First of all the new hexagonal tiles make the puzzles harder to solve. That's good. They also changed the scoring system. Instead of the tracks full of gems (which allowed for some tactical play) players now draw gems from a bag. That's way too random and lame!

I have nothing else like it in my collection.  If you like puzzles and games, you will dig this.  It's a fun little challenge, but it can be a bit discouraging for youngsters if they struggle with the puzzles.  I find that the 4-piece puzzles are very difficult, while the 3-piece puzzles are too easy.  Something in between would have been perfect for me (perhaps I need to try the other Ubongo offerings).

Played the 4 piece puzzle instead of the 3 piece ones and realised that the difficulty is much greater (or we are still tired from meeting after work for the gaming session)

Selvästi haastavampi kuin normi Ubongo, ainakin vielä. Kolmen palan puoli oli ekassa pelissä liian helppo, neljän palan puoli oli tokassa pelissä liian vaikee, neljän palan puoli kolmannessa puolessa oli aika sopiva. Jos kehitys on yhtä kovaa, vajoaa tämäkin nopeasti tylsyyden puolelle, kuten normiversio. Mutta ei aivan vielä. (6.4.2010)

Wow, these puzzles were very challenging.  I like the real time race to finish the puzzles even though I'm not good at solving them.  I was disappointed that the pieces frequently got stuck together (much like jigsaw puzzle pieces), thus they could get damaged if someone forces them apart.  Plastic puzzle pieces would have been better than cardboard, but it would make the game very expensive.

Holy crap is this game hard!  As someone who does pretty well in normal Ubongo on the 4-piece side, I figured I was safe starting out on the 4-piece side of Ubongo Extrem.  I think my ears started to bleed after about three puzzles.

A great puzzle game which is really hard to solve! Even though you only have 3 (or 4) pieces there it happens in almost every round that a player doesn't finish the puzzle in time! There are certainly people who are going to hate it, but I like it quite a bit - the only gripe I have with it is the way you get points; it's not a good game design that the winner can be a person who doesn't finish a single puzzle as the first player...

Place a number of hexagonal shapes on your puzzle board faster than your opponents. This simple premise makes for a frantic, entertaining game. Compared to regular Ubingo it seems a tad harder both because the shapes are less familiar, and they can obviously be used at more angles.

I was tempted to subtract a point for the dumb scoring system, though. When you come in dead last, and can still end up with as many points as the first place and more than second and third, what's the point in trying to be quick again? Also, why is there no distinction between third and fourth? Fortunately, this is something that can easily be fixed with a house rule.

This is harder than regular Ubongo.  It can be frustrating. I can't seem to wrap my brain around hexes. I think I will have a hard time getting people to play this over regular Ubongo.  The scoring mechanism changes this from a game of skill to a game of chance.  Like regular Ubongo, we forgo the scoring mechanism and just give the first person done 3 gems, the 2nd person gets 2 gems, 3rd gets 1 gem, 4th gets 0.  If you give up you get 0. I have only played with one person who was any good at this.  Most people seem to prefer regular Ubongo.

I thought I would like this version of Ubongo the best because of the difficult puzzles. I was wrong; this is actually my least favorite version [update: well, at least until Ubongo 3D arrived]. The hexagonal pieces just aren't as fun to manipulate. I can usually solve the puzzles, but I often feel like I sort of "stumble upon" the answer rather than visualizing the possibilities beforehand. The hexagonal pieces have 12 possible orientations instead of 8, and people's brains just aren't as comfortable with the hexagonal geometry as with the square grid geometry.

Wow, I thought I wanted this, but tried a friend's copy (without the scoring system).  Instead of puzzles taking 15 seconds or occasionally 45 seconds, these puzzles will take normal people 2-3 minutes each.  There was a feeling of success upon completion of the first few, but after three or four of them, it crossed from fun to repetitive work.  I think this game wants a brisk pace.  Those who are less good at these types of spatial puzzles will shoot themselves prior to completing a full game of this version.

Essentially the same as Ubongo, but with harder puzzles (I thought) and a different scoring mechanic. Although at first I liked the notion of drawing gems randomly from a bag as a bonus, it became clear later in the game that the luck of the draw could really imbalance the scores unfairly. Without being able to at least try to choose a particular gem, there isn't as much incentive to finish the puzzle quickly.

A multiplayer puzzle game with a tough time element. I haven't played the non-extreme version, but I suspect I'd like it more. The tetrisy shapes of the original have been replaced here with bizarre hex-based shapes that, for me at least, are confusing to an extreme. It was a thrill to win the occasional round, but the frustration of every other round is probably what will stay with me. Not bad, and I'd play again, but would probably suggest something else like Fits.

Nifty for a couple of reasons:

- It's not like anything else.

- It's fast.

- Non-gamers and newbies can jump right in.

Remember that for those folks anything more than three rules is complicated and intimidating.  Getting into this one is as easy as dumping the pieces in front of everyone, grabbing the sand timer and saying:  "You need to completely cover the shape on your card with your puzzle pieces.  First one done screams

[size=18][i][b]'UBONGO-OHHH!!!'[/b][/i][/size]

and runs around the table slapping everyone else in the head."

Okay, that last part is actually a house rule.  There are a couple of other things, like second and third place rewards, and the free draws from the bag, but you really don't need to know about any of that crap to get started.

Also, being an [i][b]EX[size=10]X[/size]XTREEEM!!![/b][/i] game it goes better with a belly full of Mountain Dew while hanging upside down from a rope.

PS.  Winning at this probably means you'll be rounded up and shot into space on the tip of a nuclear missile; it's okay, though—the rest of the chimps get euthanized.

Each round you try to fit 3-4 hexagonal pieces (number based on difficulty) into an space on a card. I was able to do many of the 3-piece ones within the 2 minute timer, but the 4-piece ones are much harder!

Completing it within the [2 minute] time limit gets you a jewel (ie: points), the first person to complete it gets the most points, etc. Also completing a card allows you to pull a random gem out of the draw bag.

I wasn't very interested in the points, just seeing how many puzzles I could complete.

Neutral - on occasion

Players try to the first one to solve the Tangram-like puzzle in limited time. It's the type of game that one like it or not, with little space to analyze the design.

May08: Quite a good little game.  I skipped the regular game and went for the "extreme".  I don't mind the simplified but slightly random scoring.  I also found the difficulty just about right.

It was a pretty close race doing the 3 piece puzzles with a 1 minute timer.  And the 4 piece puzzles with a 3 minute timer were about right.  I printed off but didn't try Ted A's 5-piece puzzles.

If you like tessellations, then this game is perfect for you.  My wife loves spacial reasoning and this went over super great.

This is clearly harder than basic Ubongo, but I think I prefer the latter.  Ubongo is always fun, this is not always the case with Ubongo Extrem.

In addition I don't like *completely* ways of scoring from Ubongo Extrem - solution in Ubongo is so much better and fun..  And that's what keeps Ubongo from wearing out (with experienced players it's not so important to solve puzzle first, but to pick right jewels in right moment).
  Bearing that it might paradoxally turn out that Ubongo Extrem wears out faster..

Significantly more challenging than regular Ubongo.  The problem is that for some people, the additional difficulty kicks it from "tough" to "impossible" and crosses the fun line.  If you have a table of people good at these puzzles, by all means, challenge them but not a "non-gamer" sort of game since the frustation level can be pushed.

RATING: 7
Streamlined scoring system (winner gets 3 points plus 1-4 random, 2nd gets 1 point plus 1-4) allows for some random variance, but is a vast improvement on standard Ubongo's gem track.  Hexes vs. squares on the tiles are a matter of taste, but the improvements to the scoring clinch a higher rating than original Ubongo for me.

Were you good at Geometry in high school? Ubongo Extrem is for you! Each player races to fit unusual shapes together. Only one arrangement will fit within the larger shape provided. There is a timer, and you get points for being faster than other players, but I hardly noticed these "gamey" elements. To me this was a harmless and structured way to pass the time. I enjoy manipulating shapes in my mind (I know some people who really hate it, and this game isn't for them) so Ubongo Extreme was fun for 15-20 minutes. I'm certainly not going to rush out to buy it or ask to play it again. Also, I think I'd find the original Ubongo a bit dull, as this one seemed to have an appropriate level of challenge.

I am not a big fan of the timed aspect in the Ubongos. I guess my puzzle solving skills are too slow. I think these puzzles are much more interesting than the original Ubongo, but wow are they tough to do in the limited amount of time. I recently bought a copy and had some fun solving the 3 piece puzzles at my own pace, but wow they were still very tough. Also I think these puzzles are too difficult for even very bright 8 year olds.

Much more difficult than regular Ubongo - the 3 piece side is doable, but the 4 piece side is very challenging.  This makes Ubongo Extrem not so useful as a light filler.  Everyone to whom I've shown Ubongo has enjoyed it, but I'm pretty sure that I couldn't say the same thing about this game.  I enjoy it, but I would have to be careful about who I play it with.  I don't necessarily like the scoring system more than the original one.  The original scoring system was kind of a pain to set up, but allowed for more control - the random draw seems a little strange, but easier to explain.  It seems like the two versions of the game should switch their scoring systems.

Just don't think this one will hit the table that often - Traded away.

Update - 3/11.  Reacquired for cheap - cheap enough to give it a second chance.

An extension of Ubongo. These puzzles are much harder and more brain burning. The scoring has been much improved over Ubongo, and the timer seems to have been extended (which I do not like), the game feels more draggy. Its still the same game, but with a much tougher puzzle to beat.

Hex patterns are much more difficult to recognise than square based. There is a bit of luck involved in the scoring, but the best player will most likely win. If this is still too easy, make sure you try Ted Alspach's Craxy expansion.

RATING: 7
Great puzzle game and (in my opinion) better than the original. The game has some luck mechanics whereby you pull random gems from the bag, but you can also play with a finish order award that eliminates this factor if wanted. The double sided boards also work well for playing with kids allowing them to work on the easier side while you try to complete the harder one. A mind burning good time.

RATING: 7
I haven't decided if I like this version with the hexagons better than the version based on squares.  Its slightly different in that you draw a tile out to find out which color of tiles you are using in the next puzzle and the scoring is different as the first player done takes a blue gem (worth 3 points) and the second place player takes an amber gem (worth 1 point).  Everyone who finishes the puzzle gets a random gem from the bag with red gems worth 4, blue still worth 3, green worth 2, and amber still worth 1 point.  I didn't find the three piece side to be much more difficult than the original ubongo, BUT the four piece side is much more difficult.  Argh!

I was a bit "puzzled" once when I solved a puzzle and still had an empty space; it must have been a glitch somewhere.  I triple checked that I was in bounds with all pieces and that I used the correct pieces.

More difficult version of Ubongo -- a nice step up from the base set but only worthwhile for those who really like the original as it doesn't really add anything more than different (and more difficult) puzzles.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Quite a fun little geometrical puzzle game, although the random element of the scoring may be a little too swingy. I understand the desire to let weaker players remain competitive, but drawing red gems seems to be as important a "skill" as completing puzzles.

Nevertheless, this is just plain fun, even though I'm terrible at spatial relationship problems. It's also refreshingly different from your run-of-the-mill game. Recommended, and I'd love to find a reasonably-priced copy, although I'll probably have to go for "original" Ubongo instead.

P.S. The owner of the copy I got to play, Gil Hova, was allegedly offered an obscene amount of GeekGold by Aldie when he won it at BGG.con :)

The hexagon based puzzles can cause headaches when compared to normal Ubongo. The game still fees less chaotic than normal Ubongo due to missing the whole "choose the line from which to select gems" part.

RATING: 7

First impression: It's ubongo with hexagonal shaped tiles. It's a lot harder than original. I'm ashamed that I actually couldn't solve a three piece puzzle in time. Original's puzzles are sometimes too easy so I like the new challenge these pieces give. Scoring system is changed but it still gives slower players chance to win the game so it's ok.

Not as good as the original, especially since the scoring system is not that good. And changing the player colors every round adds needless overhead. The timer is unbelievably slow; You can get completely stuck and still solve the puzzle before the timer runs out. Also, very often you have to wait for the timer to run out before you can start the next round. 

Well, at least the pieces are wicked.

This is pretty much the same as the original Ubongo, but with hex-based pieces instead of square-based pieces to increase the difficulty.  That is, it's a speed-based spatial puzzle game.

RATING: 6
I love Ubongo, as a light entry-level game for friends (tell them it's a Tetris board game and they'll always play), but the only thing that is better about Ubongo Extrem is the simpler scoring system.  In our one play two of the four players couldn't get the shapes to fit at all for the first few rounds, until we switched to the easier side, and still the other two players always finished first, by a long way.  The other problem is the length of time it takes to play each board - it ruined the simple fun speed nature of basic Ubongo.  I don't say I won't play again - it's quite likely I will, as I love any Ubongo-like game - but only with people who know they can get their head round it, and I won't be buying it (Ubongo I bought after one play, and it has been coming out regularly even since).

Played the first time last night. I prefer the original game over this one. It's kind of natural evolution but the original has more a sense of urgency and has more game to it. Extreme puzzles range from relatively easy to really hard as with the original there's less range - which is a good thing in my opinion.

RATING: 7
Puzzles, you either like 'em or you don't, or at least that seems to be what I hear in my game group.  For those who like puzzles this is a nice challenge.  Each round (and I believe there are 8) players must use selected peices to put together a puzzle under the given time limit (and I believe it's 2 minutes).  If you are the first player to solve the puzzle then you get a gem worth the most points, second place also collects a gem but it is not as valuable.  The rest that complete the puzzle get to reach into a bag and randomly collect a gem.  I think the game is fun BUT the way it is scored needs to be imporved.  It is nice for people who aren't as good at puzzles since they still get a reward if they complete it in time however it can be a disadvantage to those that complete it first especially if the other players draw into the highest paying gems.

Ow my brain hurts!!

It's about as easy as the difficult side of the basic game. The step up in difficulty is good, but I kind of miss the play on the gem board from the original game. Still, the new scoring system is probably better (although you still have to deal with the randomness of drawing from the bag).

It was a bit annoying having to pick a new color every turn -- we abandoned that rule, and simply rotated colors amongst all players each round.

A good buy if the basic game is too easy for you!

the puzzles are clever, fun and challenging, but racing against opponents and the sand timer can make it seem impossible. after the sand ran out, i often wanted to continue just to see how my puzzle could be solved. the scoring is much more straightforward than the original ubongo but still has a random element, apparently to moderate runaway leaders. you could put away the sand timer and have a more leisurely time enjoying the puzzles.

I really like Ubongo Extreme, though there seems to be more disparity in the spatial reasoning of other players than there are with other board games "skills".  Due to this we don't play by the gem-gathering rules, and just play as a timed puzzle-solving exercise with handicaps for faster players.

RATING: 7
[Kosmos 08 edition] {Abstract; puzzle-solving, simultaneous action, timed-turn; optimal 4p} Ubongo Extrem is a real fun gateway game.  All people I played with like it.  It can be learned in 3 minutes.  Selecting a new color each round is clumsy; so, I devised a house rule to rotate the color tiles clockwise each round.  The timer clocks around 2 minutes, which is too long for 3-tile game.  A one-minute timer should be used for 3-tile game.  4-tile game is real hard! Not all players can finish a 4-tile puzzle in 2 minutes.  I surely prefer the hexagonal pieces!

[Compared to Ubongo] One fun element in Ubongo is the set collection scoring. It drives player to compete crazily for playing order.  However, it also creates confusion.  Ubongo Extrem uses another scoring method.  I prefer the Extrem scoring method because it is simpler and allows players concentrated on the puzzle.  In addition, the random draw of gemstones adds excitement! And it might allow the slow players in the game, if they draw the red stones (people are not that discouraged when they feel they can still win).  The randomness does not bug me at all.

I have never played the original [thing=16986][/thing], but it always looked nice. When this more challenging edition came out it seemed like the version to get. It can indeed be very challenging. Having an easier and harder puzzle on each board does help of course.
In general the better player will win, but with equally skilled players, the one with the most luck of the draw will come out on top.
This game is not for everyone though, this game just doesn't click with some brains.
I really like this type of game, and this is a very good version because it is rather challenging.

RATING: 5
UPDATE:

After a few recent plays, I'm knocking this down to a 5.  It is really pretty fun to race to fit your pieces together before anyone else--that's the fun part of the game.  The downsides, though, aren't small.  

1.  Some puzzles just seem to be easier than others.  Some pieces are far easier to spatiate (is that even a word?).  

2.  The gem pulling can really screw the scoring up.  I know it's designed to make it more fun for people who might work a little slower, to keep the game engaging for all.  But, and this is a huge but, it can also take away the incentive for working faster.  Sure you get guaranteed gems, but you could also then blind pull a single point gem only to have the slowest player pull a four pointer.  
------
I hate rating games after only one play, but I find Ubongo Extrem such a good game.  Put aside strategy, design depth, and all kinds of gamery lures, and you are left with a great puzzle game that is nearly perfect in its small genre:  it is quick to play, it is easy to teach and learn, it is visually appealing, and it lends itself to repeated playings.  Consider it Tetris or Lumines for boardgamers:  a very good way to both relax and still work your brain.

As in normal Ubongo, this Extreme version mostly makes me fell frustrated, as I suck at games that require even a modest spatial ability, specially with a running time. It is stressful, and I don't want stress while playing, as my day to day is around clocks, deadlines and people that always want everything to yesterday and everything has urgency for them.

Not my choice of game for my leisure time. Still, it is somewhat fun to play sporadically.

I enjoyed Ubongo for its short but intense game play with very little explanation and its ability to allow newbies to enter the game with very little effort. This version is even more challenging than Ubongo and I find it fun and definitely more rewarding. While I have played Ubongo many times and can see the shapes and boards well enough to have an upper hand against newbies, I feel less capable in the Extreme version. Perhaps continued game play will reveal specific strategies which will accelerate my ability to figure out the patterns. I also like the scoring methods quite a bit more than the original Ubongo with the board. For now, I enjoy Ubongo Extreme as a tougher and more challenging brethren than the original version and will be seeking a copy of the game.

082912: über tough with the four piece board. But this will supplant the regular ubongo.

Really nice puzzle game. Hard too. You want try to solve the puzzle even after the time has already run out, which is a good sign.

Not as good as original, but much harder. Still must for Ubongo fans. Too long timer.

Depending on mood, this beats the 2-D version. But still not as good as the 3-D version.

Definitely harder than basic Ubongo, but still pretty much all of the puzzles are usually solved, because there is so much more time. The scoring mechanism feels better for me, but I understand the opposite arguments as well.

If you like Ubongo and would like to have something more difficult, try this.

Replaces squared grid with hex grid and pieces. Improves scoring over original.

Gioco puzzle molto divertente e frustante alla fin fine è solamente un solitario però avvolte le sfide sono talmente complicate da creare la giusta tensione.

Not as good in one way, as the weird hex-based shapes are unintuitive to work with. Larger puzzles using the original game's pieces (so five or six at a time) would be preferable for me.

Also not sold on the scoring system over the wacky fun of the original's.

Still, cool game.

I am not very good at this.
You have the pieces, make them fit perfectly on your board.

This one is definitely tougher.  Just ask us idiots.

Played a few times. More challenging than the original Ubongo (both because it is more difficult and because the hexagonal shapes are less natural - at least to me), and with a better (albeit only slightly) scoring system. I like it better than the first one, but probably not as much as das Duell. Now I am waiting for an hexagon-based version of das Duell to be really happy.

I like the puzzles/pieces from Ubongo better, but I like the scoring system more from this game.  I would probably give Ubongo Extreme the slight nod.

Ubongo with hexagon instead of squares - this leads me to play with the pieces more and mentally visualize less.

Admittedly I'm not very good at spatial puzzle games such as this, but my main reason for giving Ubongo Extrem an average score is the fact that each player's boards and pieces are different, which makes the competition aspect lobsided because certain ones are definitely easier to solve than others.  So tough luck if you happen to get the boards that utilize some of the most difficult shapes.  Then you throw in the random scoring by drawing gems from a bag, that way even if you complete your puzzle last, it is still possible to win if you can manage to grab the ruby each time.

The difficulty jump from the three-piece side to the four-piece side is incredible, in some cases, but yay, this is fun!  It does away with the strategic element from its ancestor, which is mostly a good change.  (A sentence I still can't believe I wrote.)  It's a good change, because the strategic element of Ubongo always felt like an afterthought - a distraction from the blitz puzzle-solving action.  The replacement mechanism, however, can hand the victory to someone who is lucky at drawing from the bag - of course, they still have to be able to solve the puzzles, so the winner still has to have a modicum of qualification.  Nonetheless, plucking a gem or two after you've solved your puzzle feels like a much more natural way to provide some statistically noisy scoring, and improves the game flow.

After 2+ Plays: I've never played the original so I can't compare.  I don't understand why the goofy scoring with the random gems is needed.

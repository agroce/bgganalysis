RATING: 7
A very immersive experience - surprisingly so considering it relies alot on dice and symbols. It shares many of the mechanics from "Roll through the Ages" - not just the Yahtzee elements but also the resource management, and as such feels quite Euro-gamey considering it is really a thematic experience. This really shouldn't be my sort of game - I'm a Euro-gamer through and through - but something about the presentation works well for me. Another similar game, "Elder Signs", overcomplicates things with extraneous text and very detailed, but tiny, graphics. D-Day Dice, however, is simple and attractive. It plays well solitaire, but teamwork in a group is very rewarding. I don't know if I'll still be playing this in months but for now, I'm impressed.

Traded away because I couldn't really commit to working through one scenario after another with the same group of players, so always ended up going back to scenario 1, and that got boring. Received "Louis XIV" in its place, which so far has proven a good exchange.

Picked this up at a FLGS that I used to frequent during their going out of business sale.  It's alright, but not my cup of tea.  I'll give it a try someday with others (I was playing it purely solo) and see if it works out better for me.

For a dice game it is incredibly fiddly - thousands of cards everywhere, constant reference.

Once we start playing it is fun enough, but you either utterly lose or easily win.

It's a press-your-luck type of game mixed with resource management.  It uses the [thing=2243][/thing]-style mechanic used in [thing=37380][/thing] and [thing=35503][/thing], both of which I like.  But this one has a war theme and cards that you use in conjunction with the dice.  Although it's not a sim (compared to something like [thing=29603][/thing]), the theme is so much richer than the other games I listed, that I'm giving it an extra point or two over its contemporaries.  This is a really fun game.

RATING: 3.5
Understood that we need to roll for everything. The resources to stay alive, the chances to meet up with specialist on a chaotic beach and/or scraping all the manpower to get them up the beach.......

Then we roll for chances of your men getting killed in various ways and all the while, you are trying to gather the proper 'number' to move on to the next field.

In a way, each game could be calculated and your chance of success or failure is dependent on those numbers that you must reach in order to move forwards.

In this sense, it is indeed dicing it out on a D-Day themed board. The excitement is derived from pushing your luck to get those numbers. If you fail on those few chances.....you'll lose the game.

Completely dependent on the luck of the die. You just move things along....choices are minimal and obvious. Tactical strategy is dependent on the die available. Strategy is dependent on the die. Game play or the game plays you.....is very much dependent on the die.

The cards do assist in changing some of these 'luck-based' moments.....but seriously, do not bring it out as a game. It prolongs the inevitable......the luck runs out.

So even if you really win the game, its not because you did good choices and your strategy worked. It was those dice that allowed you to do so, no matter where you move...left or right.

This is not D-Day....This is just a dice game, with a pasted on theme. For that matter, it could be a game of knights storming a castle to a fat man eating particular food to get to certain calories....

If you are looking for a dicing game...this might not even be it. If you are looking for a D-Day wargame......this is even worse.

Reasonable production. limited game play.

Nice little co-operative dice game with a cool WW:II theme. The game is simple and fast. It is very luck dependant but it can provide a challenge for the players, especially at later scenarios.

Rolling Dice aiming for various combinations is anyway enjoying!

But this game comes with a little more than just this. There seem to be many choices during one's turn and the variety of scenarios gives this game a lot of replayability.

This game was [listitem=3645061]part[/listitem] of my 2015 10×10 challenge; here's what I wrote after my ten plays (with minor formatting tweaks):

Glad this one's done.

My first four plays saw me work through the introductory scenarios, which were well designed in terms of allowing new players to slowly assimilate the rules over many plays instead of needing to learn them up front.  (See what I did there?)

My fifth through seventh plays used the full rules.  While it took me these three attempts to conquer map N-02, wherein I had to learn what silly things to avoid doing, I was by no means [i]enjoying[/i] this learning process.  Playing the game simply felt like dice-rolling tedium.

While I hadn't yet earned an Award (nor spent courage to do so), encountered a Vehicle, or even encountered all of the Regular or Unique Specialists, [i]I really didn't care[/i].  Not a good sign.

My final three plays required an effort of the will, made possible solely by my desire to succeed at this challenge.

Having played this entry entirely solo, I wonder if there's a small chance if I'd enjoy it playing with at least one other person, but I very much doubt it.  I wouldn't say no, but I'll never request it.

Not usually a co-op fan but working together to storm the Normandy beaches makes some sense. Also looks good for solo play. Each single map panel is a scenario/battle, making expansion a simple matter. The 4 double-sided maps included cover all 5 invasion beaches plus 2 other key battles and a pre-invasion training exercise to get you started.

Played several times now - quite like it but more players make success easier because trading levels the luck out and more items can be purchased. Thinking of instituting stacking limits to curb trading.

D-Day Dice came to light thanks to its Kickstarter campaign: it had great and well deserved success, so I now do own my regular copy (shipping costs made supporting from Europe too expensive) and enjoy it.

This is a yatzee-esque fun dice rolling game, tense and surprisingly thematic. I suspect it works better with 1-2 players, but I can see it played with more (maybe with some limitation: if the players stay together in the same sector and keep trading resources, the game is too easy)
.
The components are great: dice are chunky and engraved, cards and maps are sturdy.

The only problem lies with the rules: the rulebook is concise and not abysmal, but there are lots of less than clear points (both with rules and cards) and I suspect this is the kind of under-development one can find in Kickstarter supported game... Not a big problem when you can find all the clarifications on BGG, but it somehow annoys me anyway...

RATING: 8
10 Plays: A wonderful blend of resource management with a yahtzee mechanism. The later scenarios increase in difficulty and provide challenging puzzles to overcome. The cooperative multiplayer experience is enjoyable, although a bit simple. It's one of the few cooperative games I actually enjoy.

20 Plays: I think I had burned out on this game, having played a number of sessions back-to-back. One of the things that I particularly love about the game is that each of the missions has a distinct feel and emphasizes different tactics. It almost feels as if the missions are progressive and each teach a lesson that you can employ in the next mission. Also, despite what some players comment, I feel that the randomness of the dice prevent the missions from becoming puzzles that are "solved". The die results "guide" your overall tactics.

After a couple of plays, I would rate it 9. Downgraded it now to 7 after having played Elder Sign and compared to ES this game is rather bleak.

Of course it is nothing wargame like, but as a twist to a 40 minute casual game with a D Day theme, you can't go wrong if you like the theme.

Perhaps it is not very long lasting, but there are more than enough challenging scenarios to keep you playing solo wise.

The game lacks a strategy for the German (AI) player, but enough maps are made available with random advance paths.

Like Death Angle, this is a solo game which you can play in a short session and it still feels nice. 

With this kind of pricing and excellent components, most will not regret they have it in their collection.

Picked up the base game and several expansions via Kickstarter at the Enlisted level.

D-Day dice is a fun, fast playing game with relatively simple rules that puts you (a small band of Allied soldiers) on the beaches of Normandy during D-Day.  At its core, D-Day Dice is a resource management game.  Its primary game mechanic is a yahtzee style dice fest that allows you to gather resources that you will need to survive on your way up the beach.

At this time I can't see myself needing (or wanting) any of the big expansions as D-Day Dice comes with a great deal of gaming fun right out of the box.  That being said Atlantikwall does look like a lot of fun... 

When I first read the rules, I thought that I would probably end up playing D-Day Dice solo rather than cooperatively.  However, I was pleasantly surprised at how much team play added to the game.  Rather than tactically making decisions that are the best for your unit, it pays to work out a plan that work for all the units.

D-Day Dice is good fun.

Unfortunately D-Day Dice does not get played much anymore.

I'm a longtime fan of the original PnP game so I didn't hesitate to back the game on Kickstarter.  However, since receiving the published game and expansions, I haven't played it once.

I think the change from using a pencil and paper to handling a ton of little cards made the game more fiddly and a little less enjoyable.

Bought this on Kickstarter after playing the PnP version a few times. I really bought it as a solo game but was pleasantly surprised to find out it works very well as a multiplayer game. There are really a lot of options and choices to make. There is some luck involved naturally, it's a dice game after all, but planning and good play seem to outweigh the luck in my plays of the game. Components are really nice with the thick boards and engraved dice. Love this one.

I’m as enthustiastic about historical games as I am about historical novels, which means none at all: D-Day Dice stands for an exception to this rule of thumb though, as it’s a first-rate cooperative game with deep interaction among players and - what’s even more relevant - many dice to roll.

The basic RWB rulesystem is so easy and straightforward to play that the game doesn’t need anything else to get fun quickly: I can’t help but think it would make an even better science fiction themed game though. [i](November 2013)[/i]

There are things about this game that I like. I enjoy the solo play, the flavor, and the courage mechanic. Generally speaking, I like the dice rolling system. That said, it's the type of game where you can get utterly destroyed one play and then win with confidence the next, not having changed what you do. It's definitely too lucky, but it's brutal and can be a fun challenge.

Excellence in game design! Challenging yet not impossible. Sure there's a lot of luck involved, but making good decisions while managing your resources pays off. This game is highly addictive and is perfect for solitaire play. Even better in it's commercial release.  The quality bits and pieces have retired my PNP copy. I did the line for life on Kickstarter and have all the promos to prove it. This is Yahtzee on steroids (and yes, I still play Yahtzee from time to time).

Rating based on my desire to play the game again, not the quality of the game. I am sure it plays much better solo.

My first —and possibly last— session involved the training scenario with two expert players. Result? A too easy game and two players in autopilot mode. We just kept chucking dice instead of interacting with one another. 

To make things worse, I usually dislike cooperative games, and this was no exception.

Grab the dice, storm the front in a Yahtzee-style wargame? Interesting enough.

The rules are simple, the components are good, the gameplay is easy and the playtime is pretty short.

Also the RWB-System, where you get a bonus if you roll the same symbol on the different colored dice, is quite nice.

I like it, for a quick round or two, when you have the urge to storm a beach in the Normandy in under half an hour.

Just up my alley. Love the theme. Plays great 1p or 2p. Only concerns are about replay ability long-term. I also own the flare pack and Atlantikwall and 2 map packs.

RATING: 6
Been enjoying this, but it shares the Kickstarter underdeveloped feel - lots of slightly ambiguous rules and cards, feels loose and in need of further system tightening. Still, it also has a lot of stuff too, I think the whole RWB bonus thing actually works rather well, the tension is nicely managed, and it's actually reasonably evocative. Probably want to keep it to 2 or 3 players, though - 4 felt much too "open", too many player options and too much flexibility. 2 is pretty tight.
---
Got my copy, along with a metric ton of mini-expansions with my Officer-level Kickstarter pledge. Looks like a kind of cute game, but I worry about the proliferation of mini-expansions. I just don't know how much game there really is here - it's just a neat dice game. We'll see. I seriously doubt I'll play through the 20 maps I now for some reason own, though.

Will more than likely play this solo 99% of the time. So far really liking the game.

update: July 2013 - Traded away. Did not find it as fun as I hoped. Set up was to long for my liking and the luck from the dice, while part of being dice, seemed to make the game less strategy and more hoping for good rolls.Too much for me.

Well the games I've had of this so far have been very compelling. Going to the wire in the middle of each mission and managing to scrape through each one to take down the bunker. So many possibilities of what can happen. Thoroughly Enjoyable. 2 Plays

Utah Beach - 1 Win

RATING: 5
I really did not enjoy this game.  It might have just been the learning experience that made the 45 minute game outstay it's welcome by 30 minutes. It might be that it seemed like a solo game that we forced into being a multi player co-op.  The theme certainly sits in a nice spot, as does the dice rolling.  I just wondered, at times how the mechanics played into the theme.  I got the idea of building your courage. The random element of how many people you would lose to machine gun fire or land mines was fine too..  I think it was how many men you "Gained" on a turn that I just couldn't make work for me.  I didn't want to just roll for resources, I wanted to think these men came from this place...  but to just turn up on my dial...  I could make it work I suppose, but it just didn't work for me.  We thought the game was over at one point and we suddenly realized how we could get extra "men" by killing our specialists... but this just gave us one more turn as we needed to roll more men and Dustin was toast.  That might have been where there was no feeling of fulfillment.  It just ended a turn after we thought it was already over...  for the correct reason this time.

Game over man, game over.  I think I dodged a bullet [urgh] on buying this game. 6-10-14

Wow, one of the most engaging and fun cooperative games I have played. At first I was afraid that the whole dice mechanics-thing would hold the game back and not make it very involving or thrilling, but those two words are exactly how I would describe D-Day Dice. A job well done, Emmanuel.

RATING: 6.9
A rather fun dice game. The rulebook looks awesome but it could have been more clearly written. I don't think all concepts make sense. I, for example, tend to have way more men by the end of a scenario compared to the start. The setup can be a bit fiddly because you have to sort out the equipment and specialists that are available during that particular scenario.

Great game. Lots of choices to make as you work your way up the beach. The components are high quality, the replay-ability is high, even on each individual map. I can see me playing this game a lot. Very glad I went from the free, print-and-play version to the full-box version. You get a great "sense" of the fight as it flows quickly from turn to turn. I used it in my US History classes when we did an in-depth look at D-Day, and the students got a lot out of it. Led to some great discussions of the chaos that occurred on that June day in 1944. I highly recommend this game. Quick to set up, quick to play, quick to put away. While a great solitaire game, can be played with more than 1. I would recommend a 2-player game as you each take a small, but ever growing, squad up the beach. You can trade and help each other out.

I'm not into war (at all), but this has been a fun co-op to play with my boys and the dice rolling is reminiscent of Yahtzee, which I have fond childhood memories of.  I really like trying to roll the combos.

RATING: 9
This game evokes the feeling of storming the beaches of Normandy and struggling to gain just yards of ground against withering fire every bit as well as eating a bowl of Fruit Loops with Marshmallows.  Still, there is fun to be had with rolling dice and moving little dials while you and your friend execute the exact same strategy on every single map until you manage to storm the final bunker with about 150 troops between the two of you and so many munitions that there's basically just a single Nazi soiling himself as you and all those friends you made on the beach jostle into the tunnel for a post-invasion celebration orgy.

Or was that what World War II as like?  I don't know because my Grandfather never talked about anything except the Cubs.  That's what he called his balls.

I've yet to play this with more than one player.  It think it works great as a solo game.  I don't think I've lost yet, but there were a few times it came close, but got an exceptionally lucky dice roll that set me up perfectly to complete the game comfortably.  It think that with more people it would make it more difficult as some of the unique cards will be taken by other players, making it harder to complete the board as a group.  Even still, its a solid game.

 D-Day Dice as a solo is fun, unfortunately a repetive one after while. But if you don´t want to play them from dust to dawn, they will definately do as a solid filler solo.

 But they are not so good as a cooperative experience for two and more players. Simply because most of the time it feels more like "X players plays simultaniosly X solo games at once and by chance they share same goal"; and that´s no fun at all.

Enjoyable push-your-luck / resource management / cooperative game. It's nice solo or with 2 players, but I wouldn't want to play with 3 or more. I play it infrequently enough that I have to re-learn the rules each time. There are enough fiddly little choices to make this a pain.

The quality of the components is first rate, sturdily made and excellent artwork.  The game is a very clever interpretation of the Normandy Landings that breaks the conventional mould of counters and hex maps.  Play is quick, but gives a good feel of the increasing pressures of having to marshall various resources to advance to the next sector.

Excellent component quality and a fun solo dice game. But other than that? Truthfully, I'm not really looking forward to playing this that much more, which is a shame because there is a ton of scenarios that I have yet to try. D-Day Dice is a solo game, first and foremost. The multiplayer rules seem like an afterthought and are not really that interesting.

UPDATE: I have played the KS edition a few times. The fabu components definitely add to the fun, although using all the add-ons may make it a little more involved than it's worth.

Comparing all my new Kickstarter swag to the original PnP version, this could be the biggest pimping-out of a game of all time. I have yet to play the new edition, but it's likely that this is a rare case where the components are so nice that they pump up the fun factor of a decent but otherwise unspectacular game.

Perhaps the significant appeal of this game is the quickness of each game- it can fill that gap while waiting for another player or two and something light enough to conclude an evening (or very early morning) game session. It's not easy, but it is sure fun.(Vassal)

Players have to lead squads ashore on the Normandy invasion beaches, and take out a pillbox.  Die rolling game for 1-4 players.  Players play simultaneously, rolling six dice (2 each of red, white and blue).  You are granted two re-rolls, but must "lock" two dice after the first roll.  Results are tallied and recorded.  You bank courage, tools and men.  Stars are checked off to recruit a specialist to grant you a power.  Tools can be spent on equipment you find on the beach.  Courage is spent to advance up the beach.  Men are a necessary resource, but are eroded from your squad at the end of your turn, based on your position - some locations are more dangerous than others.  Excellent die roller that makes you think and plan your way ashore, but keeps the pressure on you to keep moving forwards.  You win if you enter the pillbox, and lose if you are out of men, or unable to advance when forced to.  Excellent maps and resources.  Great stuff when boiled down to a simple die roller, and the myriad of expansions and options are ignored.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Simple resource management game masquerading as a dice/war game. Can easily be explained in a few minutes and played in not much more. A certain amount of "push your luck" mechanic is baked into the resource gathering (roll 6 dices, keep two and re-roll the other four up to two times), along with planning and acquiring bonus abilities in the shape of items and specialists.
Good fun, and with all the expansions available right now, will hit the table as a solo or multi quite often.
Recommended.

A couple spins with the PnP convinced me to back this project (not to mention the mounting package of bonus items).  Feels a lot like Roll Through the Ages, but is much better suited to solo play, and a lot more intense.  This game has a lot of tough choices to make, and is a really masterful design.

I actually did enjoy it for about four plays. That's about all this game has to offer in terms of meaningful and interesting choices. Once you figure out that solitaire is close to impossible and four-player is impossible to lose, the game gets samey very quickly. The maps and variety of items do not realy do much to spice up the game, other than to confuse me as to which permutation of the variants in the back in the rulebook will actually balance the solitiare and four-player games. There is a kernel of a good game in here, and I should say that where the game lacks in replayability, it does make up for in terms of component quality and thematic flare.

SOLD IT!

Gonna have to say I'm a bit lukewarm on this one. You get a box full of bits (base game), and then find out you don't use half of them (tokens, vehicles, and like half the cards each mission). I was hoping for a less rigid setup dictating which cards are available, maybe instead some system that used all the cards and let you draw and pitch some each turn. Not sure about this game as multi-player, felt more useful as a solitaire experiment.

In the end it was worth the cost, but will likely outlive it's welcome in the game cabinet.

I have only have played solitaire thus far.  The first couple maps proved challenging at first.  Found myself winning less than 50% of the time. Improved by utilizing the strategy to wait and build up resources in the lower sectors before pushing to the bunker. Wondering if this will be successful in the later maps that are even more challenging.

Curious to see how the play is with multiple players in coop.

I traded for this a while ago, but only got it to the table this month.

I acquired this on the basis of it going out of print and on the strength of recommendations from the Solo Gamers Guild, but it just didn't click for me. The game has a lot of options, and yet is not hard to learn. It comes with a bunch of maps, it looks good. I'm not sure why I don't like it. I should. But I don't.

[b]-1st play-[/b] After playing the first map training run, and basic run (FAIL), I think I can cautiously give this an 8. There's a ton of luck and swingy results that go with it (what do you expect with a game that uses 6-sided dice?) but the choice of specialists and various paths through the mission make it feel like Yahtzee off-the-rails with mitigating power cards - in a good way.

D-Day Dice may well be one of the best and most varied in the army of Yahtzee clones, although that is obviously not saying too much. It's quite challenging (depneding on the scenario), often requires going after specific results, and still provides several different options to pursue.

Calling the game "cooperative" is quite a stretch, however. While there are very light interactive elements it's still predominantly a solitaire dice roller. And it does have player elimination which can be a bit of a pain even when a game doesn't last longer than 20 or 30 minutes.

I actually really like this as a solitaire game (yes, I would occasionally play this game rather than play some kind of computer game on occasion).  It's like, a very very thematic version of Yahtzee with lots of depth and theme shoved into it.  I've actually had a couple of teeth clenching moments once or twice before.  It's a fun novelty you should check out if you have the money.

RATING: 7
This is a pretty fun game and is a cooperative. It can be a tough one to beat once you get to the second scenario. I played it solo a couple times. Got clobbered pretty good. It's a lot of dice rolling and luck, but much also depends on how you place and play your dice. The idea is to push through all the obstacles until you conquer. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Yet to be decided what I think of thisone really. It seems to have the same problem as several other coop games have in my opinion. It's more fun to play solitaire than together with someone, simply because the decisions are not interesting enough or hard enough to motivate alot of discussion between players. But as mentioned above, maybe I better give it another spin or two before making up my mind.

This is the first ever Kickstarter game that I backed, waited patiently for, then played.

I am at a lose as to how you could take such an interesting piece of 20th century history and create such a lifeless, uninteresting and un-engaging game. There is simply no theme here, its just a dice rolling Yahtzee clone.  

I was disappointed that the game doesn't scale for the number of players. Which makes it a cake walk for the maximum number of players, and near impossible solo.

Traded away. Never to be played again.

So far, after three solo plays, I am very, very impressed with this game's design.  It plays quickly, allows for a multitude of decisions to be made each turn, and I love the way a few dice need to be locked after each first roll.  

I wonder if more players would bring anything more to the table other than the trading of items. 

Ok, so it is much harder with two players as far as I can tell.  The requirement that all units survive until the bunker makes trading and helping one another out a necessity. 

Ok, so Map 2 has me stuck.  I just cannot win playing solo.  I haven't even reached the bunker yet!

I usually don't like co-op games, but I love this one. It's easy to learn/teach, plays fairly quick and provides lots of fun and tense moments. Plus the game can be played solo, which is always a plus for those lonely nights, when you want to game.

It's kind of like a Yahtzee on crack game, with the rolling of dice and trying to manage them. I don't like Yahtzee at all, but this mechanic works well with the game and has a great feel to it. It really all work well together.

I can't wait to get all the expansions for this awesome game. FUN, FUN, FUN!!!

Many thanks to my good friend Larry, who sent me the ubber KickStarter edition with all the goodies. :)

Roll dice, move, turn left or right, its almost snakes and ladders with a WWII theme.  Boring as hell game.  Waste of money.  On a desert island I would burn this for fuel.  Its a fine game as a PnP and would raise to rating of 5.  One of my worst kickstarter backed projects.  Cheap ass components, only the die are any good and amateur graphics.  eeeekkk.

RATING: 5
Yahtzee based lite wargame - roll/reroll dice to achieve the  necessary combos to gain the resources needed to progress over the terrain board to destroy the objective being the bunker at the end of the board. There are lots of resources you can obtain to mitigate "luck of the roll" so you are rolling with a purpose and you are making tactical decisions based on what resources you need both immediately and at later stages of the game. Unfortunately all is revealed as soon as you lay down each battle board - all benefits and difficulties at each stage - so there is no unpredicability or "fog of war" other than the fall of the dice - perhaps bunker strength and special benefits and difficulties could have been tokens that were revealed as you entered each area.

Production quality is excellent and the rules are clear and well set out - icongraphy is good and will become easy after a play or two.

The co-op game is rather multi-player solo with the only co-operative action being to share resources but players still win or lose together so assisting one-another can be important.

A small gripe are the resource tracker wheels - they are quite small and loosly held together and are easily knocked off their settings as you adjust another score - not sure how best to handle that - possibly a board with a sliding scale would have been better?

Adding the Atlantic Wall expansion makes it a better game for us although we do not have enough plays to comment exactly on balance - but having a human opponent adds a lot to game play while not increasing the complexity of the game. This is an area that could be further developed and I will not be surprised to see more expansions or even a full blown platoon/squad level wargame where both sides move and act according to the mechanics of this game - Combat Commander Yahtzee!

RATING: 8
Kickstarted. Great production and graphic design. 

There is an addictive quality to this game, especially when you come so close to successfully completing your mission. Plays well solo, which is a huge plus in my book. Also, I think a good dice-based game is deceptively difficult as shown by how few really good dice games there are out there. This one manages to have a nice balance of strategy, co-op, replay value and of course, dice.

Jedno z najlepszych wyzwań solowych jakie spotkałem. Na pierwszy rzut oka mogło by się wydawać, że w grze gdzie wszystko praktycznie zależy od rzutu kośćmi losowość będzie nie do okiełznania. Nic bardziej mylnego zastosowana w grze mechanika i karty pozwalają w znaczny sposób zapanować nad losowością. Oczywiście gra jest losowa ale można tą losowość kontrolować.
Trzeba zaznaczyć, że gra do najłatwiejszych (takie błędne mniemanie można wysnuć po przejściu pierwszej planszy) nie należy. Każdą planszę należy poznać, ograć, znaleźć na nią taktykę i przy odrobinie szczęścia można ją przejść.
Świetna gra solo. Gorąco polecam.

So I finally got all my kick-startered stuff out and figured out how to play.  A simple yahtzee variant, sort of Fields of Fire, yahtzee edition.  Great idea but the rulebook has some unclear spots and the game itself doesn't present a lot of real meaningful decisions in the solo version.  It is probably more fun with a bigger group.  

I'm not totally sold on it yet, I want to try something other than the solo game.  I had one game where I tried to move through the board too quickly and died horribly, and the second game I stalled on the early rounds of the board to "build up" and just cruised through with no problems and twenty some soldiers left at the end.  

I believe I will trade it off unless 1.  It gets much deeper with more players or 2. My wife thinks its fun.

I was somewhat dissapointed in my first two or three games; I expected something more thematic.  On the other hand, the game engine works to make things engaging.

I've read some players think that the cooperative aspect lacks.  I am not sure what it means; sharing resources or discussing how to roll when someone has picked the lieutenant does not feels as if you were storming a bunker, but it feels much like what you need to do for an easy win; in the two players configuration, the game is easy enough.

I've only played solo, so I'm a bit wary of writing anything yet. This game is very solid and interesting. There's a bit to track (especially solo), but the components mostly help with this. The game is very challenging, but if you were a KS backer (like me) you have TONS of content to play. I can see my rating going up as I play more and go deeper into the experience. Overall, very solid game and great use of the source material.

An interesting re-themed Yahtzee that lets you take a platoon of infantry into a WWII battle.  I've only played one scenario and found it a little too straightforward (e.g. build up a large enough group of soldiers, then make a run for it), but I liked some of the mechanics (e.g. RWB bonus; pure cooperative play; being able to share with other players).  The artwork, especially on medals of honour, is historically accurate and very true to the spirit of the game.  I'd play this again, but won't seek out my own copy.

[i]A couple disclaimers here: I am not a solo gamer and have only played 3 different ones so far this being the best. I am a sucker for wargames. [/i]

Games deserves an 8 I think, as long as you like the theme (I do).  While the designer used the tired old Yatzee mechanic for the dice rolling (and it does work well here actually), he did one HECK of a job on the rest of the game which puts it in an entirely different class far from Yatzee and a little better than roll through the ages as well.  A VERY strong themed game here actually, note I have only played solo, to which I do think it is best suited, but it would play two just fine too however.  

Lots of great little details here, all the cards really add to the game a lot, scenarios, and the details on the board etc and note I have not played with any expansions.  It’s actually quite strategic for a dice solo game, at least there are two ways to play a game like this; fly by the seat of your pants tactically, OR what I did, plan a route from beginning AND which cards I wanted to buy AND what order I wanted to buy them in.  This leads to my next comment, I beat the first 3 scenarios the first try (and note I played 3 in a row, so it has an addictive quality), so maybe it is a touch too easy (first one is training so shouldn’t really count) however I really went into the game methodically, really focused on getting bonuses etc so this may also account for my wins, and note the 2nd two were narrow wins as well, but first try none the less.  

Oh a note on luck, I didn’t feel it really effected my outcomes surprisingly, sometimes I rolled well, other times I did not, but I always felt I could account for these outcomes either way and planned for them which likely made the difference (nice thing is that it COULD), and there are some ways to mitigate rolls too so for a dice game, I think luck is very much in check here.  

So like some others, I now regret not getting in on the KS, since it was VERY generous with rewards, free expansions etc and I think I will end up keeping the game since my wife is liking games less and solo gaming is starting to become something I may consider from time to time.  The biggest knock on the game for me was the rules, good overall but I had to look up on BGG a good few things before playing and while playing my first 2 games, they could have been a little more polished and complete, but then I could say that about 95% of the games out there.  

It is a touch fiddly also, many cards to read through and setup, and you need to watch all the little bonuses, penalties and such to make sure you don’t miss something. Maybe its missing some tension for a wargame, since you never really feel like you are losing units, and decisions could be a touch obvious at times, at least when you calculate and consider carefully but note my decisions felt meaningful.  Overall a very good fairly fast solo option, and likely a good fast co-op for 2 players as well.  

UPDATE:  Haha, Gold Beach Solo, now THERE is a peach... So much for the easy wins, this thing looks impossible, I don’t see how enough Soldiers can be generated here without a rule tweak or using a variant etc which I see other people agreeing with. Aww well, make the easy ones a little harder and vice versa for the hard ones, easy tweak and all good.

RATING: 4
Rating's for solitaire only, in which it's an exercise in recruiting as many specialists as possible as early as possible, and killing time building up your forces in the lower sectors before charging through to the Bunker as quickly as possible. Meh. Might be better with more players.

RATING: 7.5
This was my sister-in-law's gateway game. The dice made sense and were exciting to her, the theme was familiar and interesting, and most importantly, it was cooperative. 

Don't let that fool you though, it allows for some tough choices and decent strategies. The different maps and scenarios are awesome. During an important roll, especially in the bunker, I usually find myself standing and shouting (and sometimes running around my house with an imaginary machine gun).

My biggest problem with the game is that with more than two players, it seems too easy. Everyone can travel together and just before they reach the bunker give all of their troops to the one army who needs to enter. I haven't tried it yet, but Joel Eddy of Drive Through Reviews suggested a house rule where more than two armies can't be on the same space at the same time. This would keep people from sharing too much and would actually force them to take different routs up the map.

I thought Quarriors brought me around to dice games.  This blows it out of the water.  Lots of meaningful decisions, you need to adapt your tactics on the fly, and the maps I've played so far seem thoughtfully balanced.

Maybe I'm being converted to the dark side?

Very good solitaire game.  Even though it the mechanic is semi-Yahtzee-based, it still does a good job of trying to assault a bunker at various beachheads.  This is really only a solitaire game - I just don't find it works with more players.

Bought because it is a dice game and because it plays well solitaire. The rules and extremely well written and the scenarios entertaining. The components are great and playing time just as it should be.

Even so, from my first playing I still have a feeling that the game is missing something. Very much like Roll Through the Ages.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (November 2016)

For some reason, my desire to play D-Day Dice was very low, but I´m glad a friend brought the game to our sessions because I really enjoyed it, even though we only played the training scenario.

The rules are very easy to teach, you can do it under 5 minutes. D-Day dice comes with great player aids. The game´s components are very nice, the dice are of good quality and the scenarios are fun to play. The art is also very good and the graphic design is clear and intuitive. It plays very fast.

The theme is ok for me, although I almost never like World War themes.

D-Day dice is a resource management game with some luck in it. I feel the luck of the game can be controlled because you can roll 3 times each turn AND your teammates can help you in some circumstances. 

The scenarios are challenging as they should be in any Co-Op game. The decisions aren’t hard, but aren’t obvious either.

I think it is best as a two player game but I would play in any configuration. I have had the game for the iPad for years now. I will try it solo very soon.

Bottom line, D-Day Dice is an ok to good Co-Op game. I want to explore it further. It has luck in it, but I feel I can manage it, so it doesn't bother me.

Very high quality, obviously very carefully designed, tested, and built. My score is lowered a bit because thus far it seems too easy, but I've only played the solitaire variant and only 3 games on the first 2 maps. We shall see. I have very high hopes, which have not yet been dashed.

Update: The difficulty balanced out eventually, but the randomness just made me feel like my choices didn't matter all that much. Still an amazing game in regards to design, balance, and quality, but just too dependent on chance for my taste.

Very easy and quick to play, loads of reply value.  I seem to lose about 90% of the time, which makes the wins all the sweeter. Each game, whether win or lose, feels like it plays out a story of the brief, terrifying rush up the beach to take out the bunker - its a dice fest and nearly all luck which feels appropriate for the theme - to survive the attack on a heavily defended beach you needed to be very lucky.

I don't care for this game much. It seems to have too many needless mechanics... Well perhaps not needless but it is of a bloated design school concerned more with simulation than elegance. I don't think the extra realness helps make the game fun instead it is distracting and tedious.

A little bit more complicated than the typical Yahtzee style game. Players basically manage 4 resources and use them to advance on a battle board.

It does have a nice thematic feel to it, and while progression seems a bit too easy at the moment, I'm hoping later boards will add more of a challenge.

This is a fun cooperative game.  I rank almost all the cooperative games I've played (Shadows over Camelot, Pandemic, Police Precinct) around a 7 and this is no different.  If I rank them, this would be #2 for me just behind Pandemic.  The rules are simple to learn and the game plays quite smoothly with almost no downtime at all.  This is truly a cooperative game with players needing to stick together to provide support and dice whenever possible.  The difficulty is just right after 4 plays of 4 different scenarios.  This is a dice rolling game at its core so there is quite a bit of luck factor but the cooperative aspect mitigates that a little.

Players must work together to get their squad safely to a place where they can destroy a German bunker. A special set of dice are rolled each turn to determine what resources are available. Squads can find items, specialists, vehicles, additional soldiers, and courage. They must manage these resources well as they will be forced to move through machine gun fire and landmines before reaching their goal. Randomness in this game is managed via special cards and re-rolls. This allows players to "adjust" which resources they find each turn. There is also a clever system that rewards players who roll certain results with a combination of red, white, and blue dice. This is a fun game that feels almost like solving a puzzle. The theme works very well and is a great tribute to those who fought in WWII.

８つのシナリオがあるので、楽しめそう。少しルールが多く、勲章以外のカードの日本語化シールがないので、わかりづらい点がかなりマイナス。また、地図ごとに必要なカードが異なるので、適切なカードを選択するのが大変。
マニアには嬉しいゲーム（お手軽ウォーゲーム）だが、値段が高いのと2015年では手に入りにくいのが残念。

最初のシナリオは練習用のステップもあり好印象だが、かなり易しい。
２つ目からが本番。ルール間違えの初回は辛くも成功。ルール間違えを直して再開。２回目は・・・死亡。かなり厳しい。
ソロゲームとして「ロールスルージエイジス」「エルダーサイン」と比較すると、こちらの方がルールは多いが好みだ。
終了した後で、たどった道のりをボード眺めながら振り返るのが非常に楽しいゲームだ。（カードの英語が気にならなければ）お勧めする。

A solid solo Yahtzee-style game mechanic with a solidly integrated WWII theme and aesthetic.  Special props to the aesthetics of the rulebook, which really connotes that old WWII era briefing format.  The game can be played "cooperatively," but coop play tends to play like multiplayer solo player, with the caveat that players must communicate because one player's bad play can end the game for everyone. 

This was a Kickstarter for me, and it came with oodles of overstretch goodies, including a tin box that fits the bits nicely, cool extra dice, and a pretty awesome messenger bag for transporting (the/any) game.

I've played a bit of this solitaire.  Some fun.  I think I would enjoy it more with a friend.  Clever system.  All the little expansions mean most anyone might be playing this game differently.  So far I have sorted out all of the additional cards, and only played the base game.  With no expansions, this game is tough to win.

I suspect if I add in some of the expansions, such as the Badges, the game will get easier.

You must appreciate dice games and know that this is a game for 2-3 people to make it challenging.  If you are to play it with 4 it seems that the game play becomes a bit too simple.

After finding out about Valley Games / Radiant Games integrity issues, I no longer have interest in holding onto their games and supporting them.  Will continue to hold onto a couple Valley titles from their earlier years, but I will not be supporting their endeavors from here on out.  If I purchase one of their games, I will do so via the used game market.

Dropped rating after ten plays to a 7.  Realized we were playing rules for courage wrong as we were requiring courage even to move sideways which does not appear to be the case.  This made the game a cakewalk for us.  We went back and houseruled the game that every time a unit moves, courage is required equal to the cost as if you just advanced into that sector.

Enjoyed this one on my first play and give it an initial 8.  Really like that everyone plays at the same time so the game is constantly moving.  Dice seem to be cleverly used and the RWB bonuses as well as the straight appears well thought out.  Considering how quickly the men die, do be careful to pursue them on the dice.  I also enjoyed the different additions and expansions that can be added to the game.  Symbols are easy to read and understand.  So far, this looks to be a fun co-op using dice.  Cooperation will be needed to assist each other ini trading resources and working together with some of the items, etc.  Otherwise, the game is very m uh solitaire.

Poor timing (and primarily a lack of funds in the account) prevented us from jumping on this opportunity prior to 12/09/11. 

If I want to rationalize the loss, I can say that the students do not need another cooperative game (given how often pandemic and forbiden island gets played). So, despite the kickstarter hype ($170K funding), there's no need to rush and get this. 

That being said, the Atlantik expansion provides a nice element whereby one can play against the other and therefore take the game away from a cooperative angle.

Were money available, the Kickstarter bonuses might have been nice to have (See http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/726304/whats-this-kickstarter-game-all-about-an-faq-revie). While these things would have been cute, they certainly aren't necessary: (1) the bag (2) tin (3) four sets of sparkled dice (4) dice bag and even the (5) a total of six bonus kickstarter K cards (6) 2 bonus battle maps.

On the other hand, these things would be nice: (1) Badges mini expansion for RWB rolls (2) four MGF dice.

Note that the base with all bonuses was $35 on Kickstarter and the Atlantikwall was an additional $15.

Just a lot of fun playing this game.  Most of my games have been with 2 players, which works very well. You are involved the whole time, the decisons you make are tough at times, the scenarios are difficult enough to present a challenge, and the components are top notch.  Solo play is also very enjoyable and the system works well in this regard too.

This game really does not suit me. I don't find myself sucked into the narrative. All I see are the mechanics, and I very quickly find them tedious and repetitive. I do admire the way in which the design encourages the players to work together in order to manage the dice results to best collective advantage. I dislike the "status" cards with the little wheels to turn. I find them fiddly and liable to jump if bumped on the game table. 

In summary, as I'm not a fan of dice games and also not a fan of cooperative games, I conclude that D-Day Dice is just not for me!

RATING: 5
Only played solo. 

The good: nice dice! I like dice, and the ones that come with this game are pretty sweet: heavy and with corners just rounded enough so they actually roll, but not so round that they roll forever. The instruction booklet looks just great, and the rules are presented in a concise, easy-to-digest format. 

The bad: the game is a little dry. I don't know how to explain it except to say that I felt like I was rolling dice, adding some numbers, subtracting some numbers, rinse and repeat. Granted that's what the game is, but suffice it to say that I found it neither fun nor immersive. I will keep playing though, so this is an early rating subject to change.

A light, fun game with an interesting theme. Choosing the best path to build your forces for the final assault is a nice take on a battlefield, one that I've never seen and works very well. Strategy does come into play and there are a few decisions that can make a difference, but in the end it's really about what you roll. I enjoyed the handful of plays I had with it, but won't be pursuing more.

Love this game. Fantastic attention to detail and lots of ways to mitigate and manage the dice rolls. Many decisions for such a small game. Expansions add lots more too - so this one is highly recommended. Solo is awesome and 2 player is lots of fun. And on 30/06/17 - I finally acquired 100% of all D-Day Dice content that's been released, after several years of trying. Will keep me happy until the new edition arrives now.

RATING: 4
This game started out as an 8 for me, but four plays took it down to a 4.

I expect to lose a good co-op in my first few plays; this one was too easy and we never lost. Worse, the game also incentivizes dawdling -- staying in one sector for three turns, then moving laterally if at all possible. It should be a 45-minute game at most, but played this way it takes 90 and that's way too long. I don't generally enjoy having to play a game "wrong" to have fun.

The co-op is well implemented, with a different rhythm than other co-op games; I like that everyone takes turns simultaneously, but there are good reasons to interact and keep an eye on what other players are rolling. The theme is well expressed throughout every level of the game, which is neat.

There are lots of moving parts without crazy complexity, and a ton of replayability with all the different maps and options. I can see why others enjoy it, but I sold my copy.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Very cool system, can be addictive, nice components 
update: Replayability seems good.  Lots of bonus material that I could grab at the last minute thrue Valley games website.  I found the game too tough to beat with only one squad, so I am now playing with 2 squads.  I still get destroyed, but I will persist.
update march 2013: Adding more options, and with better experience, it can become way too easy.  Forget about badges, when you start piling them you win instantly.  Otherwise, some pretty good expansion scenarios worth to try.  For me it is a very good solo game to kill an hour.  As a cooperative 2+ player game it's a bit 'meh' I guess I'm not much of a coop player.  However, I tought the Atlantik Wall expansion is really fun for 2 players.

Rating based on solo play only.

Traded.

Very nice production values, and it's a neat idea to have Courage as the currency needed to advance--I liked the tension of having to make the decision whether to wait one more turn and try to bolster your forces, or just go. However, after three tries (Elder Sign, Pandemic: The Cure, and now D-Day Dice), I now realize I just don't like Yahtzee-style dice mechanics for solo play (and perhaps not that much in competitive play either). In this game, instead of an opponent that can roll to your benefit or detriment, it's like the game constantly rolls perfectly, which takes away much of the excitement. The plethora of cards available in items and specialists was rather overwhelming.

I had such hope for D-Day Dice.  It is a light war game.  It has custom dice.  It was a solo game, which at the time I was looking for.  Best of all it was a WWII game that acknowledged the fact that Canada played an important part in the war.  I could simulate the invasion of Juno beach.  One of the great victories in Canadian military history.  All great stuff!

On a turn players roll the dice, and take whatever actions the result make available.  Players take their squad further up the map, from the landing area towards the bunkers.

Unfortunately, D-Day Dice was too abstracted, so as not to be as immersive as I hoped.  Also, it was pretty repetitive.  Roll the dice, move if possible, roll the dice, move if possible, etc. etc.  I quickly became disinterested.

Probably the best dice game I own, not that I own that many.  Beats Roll Through the Ages hands down.

This is one of the only games in my collection I don't mind playing solo. (I'm not a solo player).  And it's a blast with a group.  The Yahtzee mechanic and the variety of outcomes provides a fair amount of strategy.

You start on the beach rallying men around you...form a unit...filch equipment from fallen comrades, formulate a plan and storm that Nazi bunker under withering machine gun fire.

It's just dice but it holds its theme so well, it feels like war!  A little gem, I almost didn't get.

Solid game, fairly easy to teach. Each map can have multiple solutions for players, which is a nice way to up the replay factor. I like that your strategy can be modified by your dice rolls, so that one game you might rely heavily on items to get you through, and the next you might have to rely on recruiting specialists solely to make it up the hill. A very tight, well produced offering that looks great to play and is a crowd-pleaser when it hits the table.

RATING: 7
*Jan 2013* Bought on a whim to take another stab at solo gaming, as I am frustrated trying to find players as much as I'd like to. This one appears to reduce the fiddliness of past solo games like Mage Knight and Dawn of the Zeds while still providing some enjoyability. I'm aware of the backlash against the hype of this game but it's promising to see that most of it is with regards to 2+ players which I intend to rarely, if ever, venture into with this.

I love the theme and hope this provides some enjoyment when videogames are out of the question. 

*edit* After 3 games, I'm enjoying this. First two games were on the training map and I easily won both times. 3rd game was on the second map and I was demolished.... but I see where I went wrong and am enjoying the game. I don't mind the dice and don't think the luck element is ridiculous. I also find it thematic and, while it's annoying that you're just cannon fodder, that's pretty much what the D-Day scramble up the beach was! Germans were all but sitting pretty until the allies got past their defenses and this game reflects that. It's light strategy and I like it. 

Will update on how the replayability is but right now give it a 7.5 because I'm not a huge fan of solo games but the idea of them is great for when there's noone to game with, This one is a nice combination of strategy while minimizing fiddliness, IMO.  

*edit Jan 2013* The Operation Neptune expansion is a must for co-op play. Don't judge the game system until you play the double map!

*edit June 2013* Sold. Played once with 4p and a bunch of times solo. This game gets a 6 from me and +1 because it got me into solitaire wargames and the idea of just enjoying the ride. Great components but the gameplay just wasn't there, despite me wanting to get a kick out of it. D-Day at Omaha Beach should be here within the month and that game should give me what I wanted out of this one.... only with much more time and fiddliness :(

What I didn't like was the fact that the dice rolls are the random variable, and they're for your benefit. A wargame should have the unpredictable element being what the enemy does and you plan on overcoming it, giving multiple paths. In this game, that rarely happens and the unpredictable part is what you're allowed to gather based off your dice rolls, giving one true optimal path if the dice like you. I didn't play nearly all the maps and think a 4 or 5 (with atlantikwall) play of some of the double-sized maps in the other expansions would be a good time, but with the very few times I can get even one other player to the table that wouldn't happen for a very long time and there are other games I like better.

Having said that, I still want to pick up Roll Through the Ages which I hear is similar :p

This is a fun game to play...with the exception that you are playing by yourself. The game supports up to 4 players, but you are essentially single entities traveling across the same board. You can work together, but it's rare, and only if certain rolls are met. Working together essentially breaks down to giving the person a certain resource or resources because you had a good roll of the dice.

As a single player game, it comes with 6 different boards/maps that have multiple ways to complete each one; the goal always being to make it to the other side and defeat the threat.

The components that come with the game are very high quality. The rulebook, dice, boards and cards are all made to last.

I recommend it as a 30 minute time-killer. It's fun, but it just feels like there's something missing.

This game is the primary reason why I will always look at Kickstarted games with a jaundiced eye.  I was completely swept away by the campaign for this game, what with all the little extras and add-ons here and there.  And then I got the game to the table, and every game seemed to play EXACTLY THE SAME!  Granted, I never tried any of the extras and add-ons, but I did try many different maps and different player counts, and nothing helped.

(Very costly) lesson learned.

Like Elder Sign, D-Day Dice is an enjoyable dice game that does a good job of intergrating its mechanics with the theme (although D-Day Dice is much tougher to beat).  The production values are excellent, and if you bought it as a Kickstarter backer, there are lots of extras that will keep the game replayable for a while.  With that said, it is a dice game so may not be for everyone.  Good for solitaire or multi-player.

Eh, it's alright. Pretty simple take on the whole Yahtzee mechanism with some thematic integration. The setup for each map wears on me though, and sometimes I'd rather just get to the action without having to go through a bunch of steps to play a game. I don't mind D-Day Dice, but it doesn't really stand out from the crowd except with how many different scenarios it comes with.

A solo or co-op game that turns the beach landings of WW2 into a resource management game. Ok that makes it sound way less fun than it actually is. The components are good quality, although not amazing looking. The core play however provides you with a lot of game place in a small package.

I've had success playing this game with non-gamers AND players who are not interested in the WW2 theme at all. Sometimes both in the same group. There's something really engaging about rolling dice and sharing resources collectively that just makes this game a lot of fun.

First mission felt very easy, but I'm sure that's because it was just the training mission.  I'm looking forward to playing the other maps and getting into the meat of the game.  For what it is (a dice-filler type game), I really am enjoying it so far.  I normally dislike dice games, but this one seems fun to me so far.  Maybe it's the theme, maybe it's because it's really a resource management game, I don't know.  Glad I picked it up.

Played the first map a second time and liked it far less.  Then I gave the second map a try and realized that the first map is just an easy-mode tutorial that really wasn't meant to be played more than one time at the standard difficulty level.  I like that there are some interesting decisions, but they play out quickly.

One thing that held me back from this game was the comments and reviews saying Co-op wasn't as good as solo. I'd say it probably depends on what you are looking for in a co-op. My Wife and I really like this game due to the amount of discussion that goes on about who should buy what, trading resources and discussing what we need to try roll. Even the discussion on how to tackle the maps after failed attempts is fun. Also helps that a few of the cards are built for co-op.

It's pretty abstract but the theme really helps sell it and helps you understand the mechanisms. We lost as Richard charged gung-ho into enemy fire and died.

Initial rating of "7" as it's fun to play and fairly easy to follow, although obviously as complexity builds there is a lot to keep in mind. Really nice production and components. The rulebook is pretty clear--just requires careful reading, as there's quite a lot of detail for a low-medium complexity game. However, the provided 'cheat sheet' paper is very helpful, as well as the 'learning' scenario, by which one can learn the game in stages. Got a used copy, July 2014

This provides some dice rolling fun, with an awesome theme to die for. The game is all about rolling dice to collect stuff and buy tech tree improvements. By stuff we mean you're standing on the invasion beach gathering more and more soldiers under your command. Your mission is to get to the bunker at the top of the beach. To move up the beach, you need to roll "courage" points. Every move you need to gather more soldiers to replace the ones mowed down (similar to the food requirement in Roll Through The Ages). You can buy long term specialists (tech improvements) to help out (the usual dice manipulation, loss diminishment, etc), or one-use-only items to diminish the pain as you get further up the map into the really nasty bits. I like the way the game imbues a continual sense of overwhelming loss and the desperate need to drive further up the beach regardless. I really liked the ideas behind the bonuses available for triples across the different coloured dice (you have 2 dice in each of 3 colours) which gives you something to actively shoot for every turn and expands the range of choice. There's plenty of maps for variety. It feels solo to start with, but there's plenty of techs that you'll need to get which gets the co-operation going. Good thematic dice-rolling co-op fun.

Given the number of times I've played, it should be obvious that I like the game.  It is a fun, light solitaire experience.  I have found all of the games I've played to be fairly tense, many of them coming down to the final few rolls of the dice.  Bad luck can certainly sink you, but careful play can mitigate it to some extent.  I feel that the system gives me enough of a sense of control over my fate that I can enjoy playing.

I have yet to play multiplayer co-op, but my sense is that co-op, even with just one other player, would be a bit too easy.  I will probably only play this solitaire.  I plan to get the expansions when they are available.

Based on one play: I played with three others on what was suppose to be a tough map, but with the ability to share resources if you are in the same square, the game is quite easy (we played on what was suppose to be a tough map). But even so, the game is fairly fun, yes it is dice based, but interesting none the less. Not really something I would play often, but I can see the appeal.

Playtime: ~30-60 minutes depending on player count

Comment: It's a yahtzee style dice game with a fun wargame theme. It's rather light and pretty luck based. I think each map is interesting and fun, but there isn't a whole lot of choices to be made. My biggest concern is how well this game scales with player count. 1 is damn impossible on some maps and 4 is a cake walk most of the time. I think 2 or 3 players might be the sweet spot, but I wish this game had some way to scale it based on player count. It's an enjoyable game, but not something I'm grabbing for all that often.

Extras: Mayday premium sleeves and all the kickstarter goodness.

Optimal Player Count: 3/2 > 1 > 4

[b]Side note:[/b]
I try to add in extra things like Badges or Awards for solo to make it a bit easier on some of the difficult maps. Most of the mini promos are mixed in.

Includes Badges, Commision Pack, Distinguished Service Pack, Flare Pouch, Gott Mit Uns, K-Maps, K-Pack, MGF Dice, Normandy, Operation Neptune promos and kickstarter exclusives.

Good co-op dice game. I've played it as a two player game only. 

Lots of variety in the game and missions. Tons of extras and little expansions if you bought the Kickstarter. 

Lots of planning and player collaboration.  The game isn't easy on the higher level maps. You have to manage your resources well and have good team work.

edit: discovered that the person who introduced this game to me read the rules wrong. Their mistake actually made the game more fun. Instead of playing one board have each person play a board while still working together on resources etc... much more interesting.

edit: A good dice rolling game but my wife isn't interested due to the theme and everyone else seems to have lost interest.

Rating based on 1 play on the 'Exercise Tiger'-board. For me this was a bit too easy. It's also a bit solitaire co-operative: You do your thing, you make sure to stay alive and sometimes you have a combo where you give your fellow players extra soldiers, but for the main part everybody is focusing on his thing.

RATING: 9
I was fortunate enough to get a "Line for life" for this game on Kickstarter and I'm so thankful that I did.  There is so much to love about this game.  The fact that they managed to get so much theme into a dice game is amazing, coupled with great gameplay mechanics and tons of options.  This is far from the Yahtzee clone that many other dice games end up being.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Had lots of potential, but fell flat for me. Modification of "Airborne in my pocket" with "Roll through the ages" player boards. The first is a game that places bad odds on the player and the second game just isn't fun since choices have few valuable effects and the "strategy" is always obvious and very limited. Except that with D-day dice, you have to spend much more resources on getting soldiers, paralyzing further your options which will leave you realizing in a couple of turns that you are stuck half-way through the map with no way out and the game usually ends earlier. I really hope that the backers who got all those expansions will not get tired after playing the base game a couple of times.

RATING: 9.4
D-Day Dice: The Kickstarter edition ads lots of quality to the dice, cards, maps, bags, tin box, custom cloth bag and comes with 5 expansions. The game is very easy to learn, the rules are clear, the game is very fluid, is excellent in solo mode, and ads a good interaction wen played with other gamers, as a lot of maps and as a expansion that one person plays with the German army, changing the game to a semi-copperative.

Includes the expansions:
- Badges: Makes the game more easy, but it's balanced wen used on harder maps.

- Distinguished Service Pack:More cards to create more variety and options to the game.

- K-Pack:More cards to create more variety and options to the game.  

- MGF Dice: Ads more variaty to the MGF resultes, a good twist to the mechanic

- K-Maps: Adds 2 more maps that are always good 

- Flare Pouch BGG Promo: Contains new Regular Items.

- Normandy: 4 Extra maps that can be played with the base game and has special features to play with the Expansion Operation Neptune.

- Operation Neptune: Extra maps are always good, but this expansion adds a 2 sided giant map that is excellent and a option of criating other giant map with Juno beach II and it brings new cards of Awards, Specialists, vehicles and items.

Simply OK. There's nothing particularly satisfying or unique about the dice system. The maps provide a bit of an interesting puzzle.

What turned me off the most is simply having to keep track, on four dials, of four different resources. And then cards on top of that. Just felt like game design by brute force.

Plenty of better solo experiences.

Very addictive gameplay with a nice balance of luck, resource management and planning. Sadly it does not scale play well (far to easy) with more players, especially with 4.

Hopefully, shortcomings will be addressed in the future with some needed fixes. TRADED.

RATING: 4
Played a round solo: dry, but very enjoyable, sorta like a puzzle. Really want to play it with someone else, and then do the full campaign of all 10 maps and the combos from the rulebook. Has some odd finicky bits to it, but I really like it from my initial play.

Additional plays with multiple players makes a tight game with interactive solitaire, and sometimes things go horribly wrong, but mostly thing go awesomely right. But the thrill and excitement is only in the mind, the game itself does not create a dynamic play. But still, very good.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
After one play.  It plays a bit like yahtzee, lacks interaction, and the quality is pretty much high end print-and-play.  While the art direction is good, the art itself (the medals, the soldiers) is not professional and could definitely be better.  It's also a bit boring.  I could see this appealing to co-op fans even though it is highly a solitaire game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I got this as Kickstarter game. I was excited by the theme as well as with the idea of Kickstarting a new game. And I have to say the components are first rate.

However, I have to agree with many other BGG posters that this game does feel like Yahtzee with D-Day theme. This is not necessarily bad, but I like my games about serious war events to a little more meat to them.

Also it does does seem to get much easier the more players you have. With that in mind, I'd say D-Day Dice works better as solitaire than multi-player.

I am willing to keep playing this and my rating may certainly change, either up or down, but I do not see this as ever becoming one of my favorites.

Really enjoyable dice based game.  The RWB bonus mechanic makes for some interesting decisions.  I like all the different maps that came with my KS version with the expansions.  I hope this game is developed further.  Although it plays well as a multiplayer, I mainly enjoy this as a solitaire game.  Easy set up, light, and quite fun!  

This really is a nice light solitaire dice game.  It is disappointing that it hasn't been developed further by the publisher.  I still have KS material I haven't tried yet.  Simple but fun although I lowered my rating accordingly.

Looked a bit ponderous during rules explanation, especially the negotiation for trades (I never liked negotiation games) that looked like it could drag, and the number of equipment cards available seemed high, but turned out a lot more fun than I expected. Will need to play beyond the training exercise to really judge it fairly - four player exercise lacked tension (we were never in any danger of losing) and a bit long.

Overall, fairly promising. I really like Yahtzee-style combo rolling and the co-op works well.

Zuerst, d.h. im Solotest, erschien mir dieses kooperative Würfelspiel (mit qualitativ gutem Spielmaterial) interessant und spannend: Ein Trupp Soldaten kämpft sich während der Invasion in der Normandie einen Strandabschnitt bis zum diesen Abschnitt beherrschenden Bunker vor; die Verteidigung übernimmt die Spiel-A.I., d.h. gewisse Szenario-Vorgaben (zum Grundspiel gehören acht Szenarien unterschiedlichsten Schwierigkeitsgrades) sowie das Würfel(un)glück. Das Spiel bricht allerdings regelrecht weg, wenn man es zu zweit oder dritt spielt; die ‚Action‘ ist dieselbe, die Entscheidungen sind – im wesentlichen – dieselben. Nur: Die Entscheidungen der anderen Mitspieler sind entweder offensichtlich oder langweilig oder (meist) beides: Es bedarf keiner Kooperation oder Beratung. Und zumindest für die erste Hälfte wirklich jedes Szenarios gilt: Sammele so viele Soldaten wie möglich, um die wachsenden Verluste beim Vorrücken auffangen zu können. Das ist vermutlich sinnvoll, Spaß aber macht es (mir) nicht.

Kickstarter Officer level so I got all 20 maps (Base Game, Operation Neptune, Normandy an K-map sets).that are currently available.  After finishing all 20 maps solitaire I found that even though the game has fantastic components, it is basically, a luck based dice roller.  Even though it has a resource management component, the player has to roll the required dice to be able to use these resources and I found that in many instances, this was not possible due to the luck of the roll.  In fact I had many games that I was not even able to get off the first sector.  Through perseverence I was able to finally 'beat all the maps', but I found play to be very repetative and in some instances frustrating.
Bottom line - if you roll well, you can succeed; if not - well you will 'die' on the beach!

Initial solitaire play only to get a feel for the mechanics.  While the game has good solitaire play, I htink I like the game with 2 or 3 players as there is a bit more table chatter and discussion of plans.  Right now, 3 player has the best appeal for me.  Enough players that one could venture alone while the other two stay together for trading/balancing of resources.  And (usually) a chance to reorganize on the beach as needed.  Experienced players can jump right into the full (live ammo) training scenario as the rules aren't all that difficult.

Solo Player Value = Excellent, but very difficult. The game is easier with more players due to the ability to trade.

Two Player Value = Excellent

Three Player Value = Three Player Value = Good. Fun and brutally difficult.


D Day Dice is a great cooperative push your luck dice game. It is fun, offers great strategic choices and is tough enough to keep you coming back for more.

D Day Dice uses a cool new mechanic called Red, White and Blue where matching dice faces of each different colored dice trigger powerful bonuses. This works to emphasize the push your luck mechanic as the player wants to roll the dice more to get the Red, White and Blue combos.

D Day Dice is essentially a solitaire game. Adding more players is easy as player interaction is minimal and really only occurs with the trading and sharing of resources.

Players play against the game on pre-set maps. Each map is different and offers increasing difficulty. The maps contain the information on how the game will behave and fight against the players.

Players have a very clear victory condition: survive and beat the map. Everything else is death. This is a great way to give the game a feeling of urgency. And since the death of a single player equals all players losing, this strengthens the cooperation of the players. With higher difficultly the player will need to work together to survive and win.

On the negative side, the difficulty of the game is delightfully rough. Some could be put off by this. It takes luck and strategy to beat the game. Players might need to play each map several times to learn the different strategy required.

[b]-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[/b]

I have decided that the best way to handle to first set "expansions" for D Day Dice is to simply list them, and judge them, in a single list as a single set. These are all the expansions that came with the game during the Kickstarter period anyway.

I am not sure that I view these "expansions" as truly being expansions to the base game. Since they all came with the game I view them more as part of the original game. I feel that is a fair.

With that being said I will clump all these into a single whole. I will not change my original scoring of the game as all these combined do very little to change the base game.

[thing=102198][/thing] - Really just 8 cards that are in groups of cards already in the base game. 

[thing=111827][/thing] - This does change the game slightly as it offers the players a new choice of card to acquire. This is the second best of these small expansions.

[thing=114185][/thing] - Only 6 cards. Yes, it is true these 6 cards are nice and powerful. I feel these should be included in the game and not part of an expansion.

[thing=113108][/thing] - Probably the best expansion in this group. These dice offer a fun new mechanic for the Machine Gun Fire.

[thing=127370][/thing] - 2 new maps.


[b]-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[/b]


I have also decided to include the BGG Promo expansion Flare Pouch with this group.

[thing=101949][/thing] - 6 item cards revolving around flares.

Interesting light co-op wargame. Definitely needs multiple players.

Puzzle like elements means that once each map is 'solved', it loses a lot of interest. I've not tried the German player expansion - which might solve it (but I'm not too confident).

Great game - if a limited lifespan.

Got the Line for Life subscription from Kickstarter, so I will not be marking every entry as owned.  

Very good resource management game where the resources collected and used is part of a press-your-luck mechanic of dice rolls.  Clever game that can be played solo or with 1-3 friends.  Various gameboards supply different difficulties based on the obsticles presented on the board.

Played the live ammo version of the training exercise with 3 players.  Easily learned, played quickly but gave you a hint of what is to come.  Afterwards we looked at some of the other maps - and while it seemed fairly easy to win in that first game it is clear that will not be the case as you move through the rest.

The cooperative aspect keeps it from being just a multi-player solitaire game.  I like that the units can take different routes.  And while there is the 'luck of the roll', it is mitigated by the potential to trade and share resources.

Rating it a 7 for now, but will revisit that after I try a few more scenarios either with a group or solitaire.

Supported on Kickstarter. Arrived Jul-10-2012.

Played some solo games. The full Exercise Tiger was a dice love-fest. I played without badges and ended with a jubilant score of 283.

I then played Juno Beach twice with badges. I heard the badges were overpowered, but that bit of gossip didn't help me take the bunker. In the first Juno session I went right and was cut down in sector 3, wondering where the rest of the army had gotten to. It was over oh so quickly.

In the second session, I went far left and then cut back over to the right to get the free Beachmaster. The dice were not my friends. I made good use of a 2 skulls = RWB badge. Skulls are normally a bad thing, but when turned into a RWB you get 20 tools. Doing this was made even easier with the lieutenant who had 2 different skulls to offer. He had very little to offer in the way of soldiers though, and the whole game was a struggle for them.

I finally made my way just south of the bunker. If I advanced, I would be cut down by the 3 MGs there, that is unless I rolled 4 or less on a 3D6. If I stayed, I had a 50% chance to live, and even then, how would I press onto the bunker with just me and Jimmy Trenchfoot? I gambled on an award. This one let me discard a specialist to take a free RWB. Excellent! I moved into the bunker, took a Special Find RWB, and fished the grenade out of the discards for 10 tools, suppressing the machine gun nest. All I had left to contend with was the 15 DEF, which, of course, was my remaining total of soldiers and specialists.

In other words I was 1 guy short. Close game, good and tense. Next time I try Juno I'm going for the tank.

Oh wait, did you want a review here instead of a session report?

PLAYED 4-PLAYER JUL-14-2012:
Exercise Tiger should not be played four players. Or really at all. I'm not sure how we wound up playing this scenario, as it's intended just for teaching. I thought somehow we would say okay we get it now, let's bring out a real scenario, but instead we played it all the way through. We travelled as a group, played extremely conservatively, traded excessively, over-analyzed, over-discussed, and just optimized the hell out of this play-through. Net result was well over two hours, everyone ended with over 60 soldiers, all specialists were gone, all items were distributed, all badges were purchased, everyone had several awards, and we bazooka'd, bangalored, grenaded, and flamethrew the last three sectors suffering no more than 3 in total casualties. It was ridiculous. It was 2 hours of hanging around by the water like a bunch of nattering nancies discussing the professional-couponing followed by five minutes of an easy drive on the bunker. It was way too boring followed by way too easy. Obviously Tiger was a bad choice, since that's an easy scenario, but I'm questioning whether this game works with four players. Maybe two is better. Solitaire definitely works. Hrmph. The trading was just insane -- shouldn't we have to sacrifice some "communication points" or something to trade on the warfront with bullets flying at us? Shouldn't we have some greater excuse to follow different paths, rather than religiously clumping together? I feel like we missed something.

PLAYED SOLITAIRE Jul-16-2012:
N-08 Merville Battery
Another ridiculously easy game. Ended with 97 soldiers and over 320 points. I'm beginning to think the Badges expansion is too nice. [Correction: over 240 points] Took about 21 rounds.

PLAYED SOLITAIRE Jul-17-2012:
N-02 Omaha Beach
I misplayed the last game, failing to take -10 points for each badge. Trying to take as few badges as possible adds additional challenge. In this case, I decided to go as fast as possible too, so I did it in about 12 turns, final score about 260 points, thanks to taking only 2 badges. This game works very well solitaire, because it's pretty quick to start up, play, and put away, once you get used the set up. I think it's probably better for one player than more, but maybe two would work. I'm eager to try Overlord though. PROVISIONAL RATING 7.5 for solitaire, 6.5 for multiplayer.

RATING: 6
D-Day Dice is a solid pure dice game. It has way more strategy than most dice games. It scales well (except for spamming certain items, but I'd advise taking those out with more players anyway), has meaningful decisions, gives a strong sense of progression, plays quickly, and has virtually no downtime. D-Day Dice is a good cooperative game, and it works exceptionally well as a solo game. 

The only issues I have are that the game is a bit too easy, and the gameplay suffers from a lack of strategic diversity. It should be easy to adjust the difficulty through optional and house rules, so this isn't a big deal. The biggest culprits are the Flamethrower, Grenade, and Bangalore Torpedo. If you can reuse them many times, which is especially possible with higher player counts, it can make the game completely trivial. It's probably a good idea to remove those items once you're experienced, or at least only allow them to be used once (no retrieving with Special Find). The differentiation in specialists and items is enough to last through a decent number of plays, but starts to feel samey after 20-30 plays, so D-Day Dice is not as replayable as I hoped.

My high score for this game is largely in part to how great it is for solo play.  Especially when you consider the fact that I am not a big solitaire game player.  Very fun and light with important decisions to make.  Even on a first play, it was not that difficult to keep track of all of my specialists/equipment.  Dice-rolling, risk-taking, holding your breath in hopes that the Machine Gun Fire doesn't decimate your guys.  Top-notch and if you missed out on the Kickstarter, be sure to pick it up once it hits the street.

Sadly, the classic problem of an indie game gone wrong. There's some good ideas in here. I particularly like the idea of getting red-white-and-blue bonuses, which was a great way to add the excitement that dicing can generate to a game that primarily uses its dice for resource generation. It just doesn't gel into a good game. In particular, there's nothing to hold the players back from cooperating perfectly, which generally ruins co-op games. I think we're going to see more poorly developing interesting games like this as Kickstarter continues to boom.

Thrilling solo dice game that keeps you at the edge of your seat. However, it can become a little unwieldy when you have too many abilities/specialists/items in your tableau and game play may feel a little clunky then. I don't care much for the co-operative variant, which works well but feels like four players playing the game simultaneously by themselves.

RATING: 7
Solid, meaty solitaire dice game. You can play multiplayer but it's essentially solitaire.

Each turn you roll 6 dice (with two re-rolls) in order to generate soldiers, courage, equipment points etc in order to progress through a map. Each section of the map has brutal requirements in order to progress. You can stay on each section three turns, losing soldiers marked on the section each turn.

The requirements get harder the further you advance up. Scenarios are based on famous beach landings in WWII. 

It's a hard slog and you'll die more than you will succeed. A clever package with quite alot of options. A clever twist is the bonus awarded by rolling triples on each of the red, white, blue colour dice. A staights gives you a Medal of Honour bonus.

Glad it got picked up by a publisher. Yahtzee with objectives and some clever additions.

I was a bit skeptical at first since the game revolves around a Yahtzee-like dice rolling mechanic, but I ended up liking this game. The RWB bonuses, Recruits, Items, Awards, etc. really make this an interesting and exciting game with a massive amount of replay value. Rolling dice is fun and there are 8 maps just in the base game that offer various degrees of difficulty. Make no mistake, this is not an easy game. I think this game is best for 1 player playing two units or 2 players each playing one unit working together.

Ugg.  Military themed Yahtzee is still Yahtzee.  The few decisions you actually get to make in the game mimic nothing anyone in combat actually experiences.

Even in the nearly barren landscape that is solitaire wargame designs this one stands out for suck.

The game materials are very nice however and this may somewhat redeem itself if the co-op is engaging in the 'random carnage binds beer and pretzel gamers' kind of way, but I'm not going to hold my breath.

Fantastic co-operative game.  It's come a long way from the PnP I used to play, evolved from a game that was a bit lifeless on printer sheets to glorious in real components, transformed from almost impossible to win to a very balanced and well-done ruleset.  The expansions only add to the joy of the experience and doesn't bog down the game at all.  And it successfully incorporated perhaps the only co-op I'd want to play competitively with Atlantikwall.  GREAT GAME!

This is a cooperative WWII-themed game using a Yahtzee dice rolling mechanic.  I never personally sought this out because of the WWII theme.  I'm not a war gamer and I'm overall just sick of WWII themed games in general.  I didn't really know much about it past the theme but a friend in my game group had it and I think it has potential.

I say potential because the scenario we played, with it being my first time, was introductory and WAAAAY too easy.  So I didn't particularly care for my first play but I still liked how the game was played and could see with some more difficulty it is one I would enjoy.

The game is played (and remember, I've only played the training scenario) with players storming a bunker.  The players are represented by dice on a cardboard map.  Each turn players roll dice Yahtzee style in order to acquire more troops (which are lost as casualties each turn), medals (used to advance on the map), stars (used to buy specialists which give players special abilities), and item points (used to buy items which give players a one time effect).  The game is fully cooperative so these resources can be traded freely between players for best effect.  The dice come in 3 color sets and there is another neat mechanic where if you roll the same symbol in all 3 colors you get a powerful bonus and if you happen to roll one of all 6 symbols you get a very powerful "award" bonus.

You can only stay in an area for 3 turns then you are forced to move onto the next one where typically the losses are greater and more bad stuff will happen (and sometimes there are bonuses as well).  My issue with the introductory scenario was that the first four zones were not very dangerous and being able to spend 12 turns in these areas allowed us to get enough resources to buy up everything of value and finish the game reasonably unscathed.  The biggest loss players experience each turn is to troops and I finished the game with 35 of them left.

But like I said, I like the mechanics, and more punishing scenarios with a lot more tension and tough decisions would really make this game pop so I'm more than willing to give it another try.

[Valley Games 12 kickstarter edition] {WWII; dice-rolling; solo, scalable} D-Day Dice is an enjoyable filler.  Quick and easy to play.  And, it's challenging to play as it's not easy to arrive the bunker safely.

My friends are complaining that this game lacks player interaction, which I don't agree.  With good cooperation, players can arrive the bunker much more easily.

The kickstarter edition is wonderful.  There are so many bonuses and components :)  However, I don't know the practical use of the metal box.

Dice-driven co-operative game set during WWII. At its heart this is more of a resource management exercise than a combat game. Each turn you are required to roll six dice coloured red, white and blue and with the combination of results you can obtain more troops, specialists (who have skills to help you overcome certain parts of the game), courage (needed to progress), and items. This is done to progress across a battle map divided into sectors that become progressively more difficult and the trick is to find the right balance between the selections you make and which dice to re-roll. The game itself is beautifully produced with excellent component quality but overall the gameplay feels a little repetitive with the constant rolling of dice followed by the necessary upkeep of the results and often the decisions you are confronted with are too obvious.

Not tactically deep and I feel that, after 2 plays, we've  found what is basically the optimum way to play.

Having said that, it's a fun co-operative game which seems to do a good job of avoiding the leader problem of co-op games by making so much of the decision making simultaneous. There's a good variety of maps in the game (8 included in the version I was playing) which each offer a few variations on how they play.

As far as Yahtzee, co-operative games go, this might be my favourite.

Foxhole Yahtzee.  It's hard to imagine a better execution of a war-themed dice roller.  The production standards are reasonable for a Kickstarter but leave the theme a little scant.  Larger boards and varied card art will eventually help, as a reprint seems like an inevitability.  The cooperative element is either underutilized or unnecessary, since most of the gameplay is roll, allocate, repeat.  The simplicity of bunker penetration brings back fond memories of Beach-Head on my C64.

Updated rating of 8.5.

After sitting unplayed for several years, I recently took out DDD again to play with my 8 year old son.  It had been on my trade list.  After two games of it, it is coming off and back into the fold.  In fact, I'd say it's likely destined to be a top 20 game.

It can be incredibly difficult to win and the reliance upon dice for everything causes massive, game wrecking turns.  I lost 18 men in three turns--to machine gun fire alone.  To give some perspective, it's rare to get more than 6-7 guys on a turn, and men are fed into the meat grinder every single turn.  It's like trying to catch water with a sieve.  

Strictly from a game perspective, I don't know if it gets very high marks.  There are a ton of moving parts here, and it takes way too long to explain the rules for how simple the game is.  

From an experience standpoint, however, it is tops.  Played with the right mindset, with the right people, with at least a thought towards the history that is being recreated, it is outstanding.

Kickstarted.

The game is actually not bad. It's hard but simplistic and fun. It's how a reimagined Yahtzee with a theme would be. Also quite fun solo.

After my first few plays I'm seeing this as a promising medium-light, luck-driven, solo game that appears to have a lot of game in a small package. I've been looking for something like this to take on my work travels. I'm excited to work through all the scenarios and increase the difficulty.

Initial rating is a 7. It could go up with more plays.

UPDATE:: As suspected, it's gone up to a 7.5 with a couple more plays. It ends up being a pretty fast-playing game once you get the hang of it. I'm glad to have it and still have plenty of game to discover here. I look forward to working through the scenarios.

War Yahtzee! That's a slightly unfair description, since there's a lot more to it, but it's not too far off. Lots of tough decisions but it still boils down to the luck of the dice rolls. Great looking components. Recommended for those who like both wargames and dice games. Rating based on solo play.

Mostly want it as a lightish thematic dice chucker. Reviews look like this would be up my alley despite being WW2, which I normally avoid as a theme. Played with the free version was fun, so I found me the full version. It esse tially really is yatzeeh with soldiers, so the dice can hate you or love you, which can make or break the game. So I definitely have to be in the mood for this.

RATING: 5.5
First Impression:
A solitaire dice game that can be played cooperatively, set in WW2.

The basic gameplay is simple, but the various possible dice combinations make it challenging. It's one of the best implementations of the yanzee style dice rolling I've ever seen. Other than that, the theme on top of the dice rolling is remarkably well implemented. The variety of equipment, personel and obstacles draw the players into the theme, even if they spent most of their time dice-choosing. The co-op mode is working pretty well, but feels less natural than the solo and seems easier. Most importantly, the game creates the feeling of tension and despair that I'd expect from its theme.

On the downside, the game is still at its heart a simple dice game and this can be frustrating at times, as luck plays an equal role to skill and decisions. Bad rolls can kill you, and that really translates poorly to the theme.

Overall I really liked this game, despite the simplicity at its heart. I think it's very enjoyable and I'd love to play again.

OK this is a nice design, with high quality components and a neat cooperative element. But how many more Yahtzee variants do we really need, and do they really need to get this complex? Three introductory scenarios to gradually introduce all of the game concepts? Page after page of rules? A myriad of different cards to mull over and choose from?

Ok game. Played only once and wans't thrill about it. I'm willing to play it again though.

I found DDD a coop in which you do your thing, I do my thing and we meet in the end. This is even more so if played in two and the players are in different spots on the map (although this would be unwise, as the possibility of trade appears to be paramount to do well in coop mode).

This might well be only true for the match played, but so far is to only truth I know.

I quite enjoyed my first game with three players. Sure, there is a lot of luck involved, but the co-op aspect of the game is really strong, making it necessary to share resources to make sure all players survive the next advance. It plays quite fast too, even though the puzzly distribution of resources may take some time to manage well. Would gladly play again.

D-Day Dice takes the Yahtzee "roll three times and set aside dice" system and makes it into something special. Roll the dice collecting soldiers and courage which allows you to advance, or get stars or tools for recruiting specialists and items, which provide new skills, dice manipulation or bonuses to use as you progress.

D-Day Dice is the best dice game I've played, I think. It's more involved than most, we had great fun talking about every single roll and what we might do, should we keep this or that, re-roll, go for a Red-White-Blue bonus, keep something I don't need in order to trade it to another player, and so forth.

We found the game ran quite long, because we were doing so much talking and strategizing during each turn. Which is not a bad thing at all, it makes the game soooo much better than a co-op like the dreadful [thing=100901][/thing] last month, where there was nothing to discuss because everything was so obvious.

UPDATE: Sold. It got boring.

We keep playing this cooperative dice-rolling game, but it's oddly dry without the charm of too-easy-but-fun Elder Sign. The replayability is heavily driven by the challenge of completing maps, which suggests that it's a trade candidate without expansions. Haven't played yet with Atlantikwall so I can't judge if playing it competitively improves the game.

I'm sure the appeal is similar to Lord of the Rings LCG - a challenging activity that Jon and I can do together when I'm too tired to compete with him. The custom dice are an added draw.

Even though it looks like a dice game, I would say skill plays a major part. First few games I was getting beaten, then after figuring out how to play it properly (e.g. more skillfully), winning becomes easier.

Main gripe is that it becomes a resource management game, and when you start collecting a LOT of cards, it is easy to forget some of the abilities you gain, and some of the complex interactions that can occur.

D-Day Dice doesn't present a lot of real meaningful strategic decisions, but the game is ok if you are looking for a light solitaire experience. "Puzzle dice filler with pasted on theme" pretty much sums up the game. It's better than Yahtzee I suppose.

This is a neat take on the push your luck dice game genre. The beach landings at Normandy are not something I ever thought I'd see paired with Yahtzee. But it works, moving from sector to sector and working your way up the beach does strangely lend itself well to a push your luck game.

The Kickstarter for this little print and play game went off like gangbusters, so the retail box is just over flowing with gorgeous components. I wanted to love it, but after only a couple of plays I traded it off because despite all of that stuff, the game was just too easy. That's a big problem in a solitaire/co-op game. I ran through a couple of different scenarios and never even came close to losing. Maybe I am just really lucky, but I got bored and I got bored fast. The expansions may have ratcheted it up a bit and the 2-player head to head one looked interesting, but I didn't want to invest more into it, since the base set had already flamed out before I got my money's worth out of it.

Enjoying it so far, but the setup time and having to refer back to the book for everything is annoying. Also annoying are Item rolls--Soldiers are just too important. I've had several games that were literally unplayable: dead within the first few turns, no matter what. That's not good.

But I like it, and my kids like it, so it's a winner. And there's lots of variety and options to keep it fresh.

After one play: This is a neat game with some cool mechanisms; well balanced but it is very random.

I enjoy co-operative play, and I feel that the dice-based nature and the simultaneous play helps prevent "quarterbacking" in this game. I am also just a huge sucker for rolling dice. I feel that this game does justice to its theme, and the components are very nice. 

The one thing that give me pause is that the game seems a bit fiddly for a dice game. This rating may go up as I grow accustomed to the rules, or go down if I become frustrated with them.

Co-op gateway Normandy Beach storming Yahtzee variant with resource management.  Use red white and blue special dice to recruit field and combat specialists, muster courage and earn medals for bravery, requisition equipment to save the hour, while advancing into increasingly deadly and challenging sectors.  I like how the straight, and 3-of-kind bonuses tempt push-your-luck.  I like how final rolled skulls take away another saved die. I like the co-op aspect to share dice. I like the progressive and varied types of challenges faced while advancing up the beach. It is most enjoyable with two players.

My enjoyment started slow for this game.  After rushing through training, I wondered if I made a mistake in buying it and it's expansions through Kickstarter.  

I failed at Utah beach a number of times and began to like it slightly more.  Because I failed about 6 or 7 straight times, I learned that there is definite strategy.  Even though it's a dice-fest, because of the movement decisions you must make as you move up the beaches, lucky rolls alone will not help you.  

How you move, the weapons and specialist cards and badges you choose to buy can be critical.  In addition, each beach has it's own personality, new strategies that have to be learned, and pace at which to traverse the beachfront.

A reviewer called D-Day Dice 'Yahtzee on steroids.'  I believe you can't compare the two games.  There are many more choices and critical decisions you must make in D-Day Dice than in Yahtzee.  To me, because of that, it is much (very much) more fun.

The number of maps, cooperative play, and an expansion that allows you to play competitively called Atlantikwall will keep the game fun and re-playability factor high for a very long time. 

I'm now very happy I Kickstarted this gem.  :)

Fun, quick game. Setup can take a little long for what it is as a player needs to find necessary cards relevant to the board they are playing on.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A collaborative dice-chucking diversion that, towards the end, turns into a mathy survival exercise.  It's neat that multiple beaches are provided so that scenarios don't grow stale after only a session or two.

In terms of potential drawbacks, [i]D-Day Dice[/i] is neither deep nor highly strategic - nor is it clear how much cooperation is really involved.  It's not like players can choose to roll certain symbols with the intention of trading those resources to others. Either you roll the resources that you want - whether they're for you or for someone else - or you don't.  That's the nature of the dice.  And when players do trade, troop and courage reallocation is mandatory to ensure that all players can advance up the beach and stay alive.  ("You're two courage and one dude short? Ok, take mine.") It's only the trading of stars/tools that involves any sort of real decision-making.

To be truly co-op, I'd think that players would want to stop and talk after each round of die-rolling so they can discuss which dice to keep, etc.  But that might lengthen the game to the point where it's not worth the time investment.

[i]D-Day Dice[/i] may also suffer from whatever rating inflation  is associated with crowdfunding games.  People who back a kickstarter game are more likely to enjoy it, possibly?

These issues aside, I had enough fun the first time that I'd play again.

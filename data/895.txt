Finally got the 2000 ed. Dice and charts and more charts. Plays faster than Strat-o-matic but not as well supported currently. Catholic or Protestant? APBA or Strat? There's something about the APBA cards that I have an affinity for that goes beyond reason.

This is a poor man's Strat-O-Matic.  I played a league in 1989 based on the 1987 cards.  I missed the draft and the other guys gave me decent players, but ultimately tried to shaft me (and told me I was taking over someone else's team).  I ended up winning the league AND the post-season tournament.  Jack Clark was MVP.  Greg Gagne (weak hitting SS) won the batting title.  That is pretty much all you need to know about the realism.  It's not nearly as smooth and realistic as Strat-O-Matic.  You cannot look at a card and instantly scout a player.  The game play has WAY too many charts.  It is fun, but if you played Strat-O first, you won't want to waste your time with this.  If you have played this, try out Strat-O-Matic for more enjoyment and realism.

Good game for 14-year-olds and under. Otherwise, a simplistic and unrealistic simulation. (More "charm" here than in S-O-M Baseball, however.) They blew it big-time years ago, when they created their kludgey "Master" game instead of making cards double-sided for righty/lefty purposes.

In all honesty, there isn't really any strategy in this game, just roll the dice and read the appropriate chart. But it is still really fun. Only problem for me with this game is the cost of the player sets online. Anybody have any extras they're not using? :)

While I've played tons of games with APBA including a complete replay of the 1969 National League, I must say that from a statistical standpoint, it doesn't stand up to Strat-o-Matic, especially for the pitching. I still have fun with it though and it deserves a high rank.

Update: Bumping my rating up to the coveted 10! After thousands of games played over the years, it well deserves it.

It's a classic in the baseball sim genre. It lacks the depth of Statis-Pro baseball though, so given the choice I'd rather play that any day.

RATING: 4
Even less control than strat-o-matic.  Solitaire statistical baseball sim game for baseball fans only.  Maybe better as part of a league or played as a season or with the use of a computer.  Just not enough of a game in this game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Still a fun game after all these years.  The pitching grade system will not give you fine tuned stats such as hits to innings pitched or have any effect on homers hit and the fielding (which is a solo number that is taking into account error frequency, range and throwing arms) is not very realistic.  Also, outfielders are listed generically (i.e left fielder, center fielder, right fielder).  The strength of this game is its quick play ability and colorful cards.  UPDATE:  Recently purchased the newest version of the game with the larger bound boards and enjoy the subtle changes to the game to make it more accurate.  Nice sturdy box, nice component parts and I am enjoying this game perhaps even more than one I first started playing it in the mid 1960's.

I enjoyed APBA Pro Baseball until I played Strat-O-Matic Baseball.  Now I see some of the weaknesses of APBA Pro Baseball.

For starters, the manager has far less control in APBA Pro Baseball.  For example, a manager cannot choose to have one of his players attempt to steal a base.  In Strat-O-Matic Baseball, however, the player has the freedom to make almost any decision that an actual MLB manager could make.

Also, the player must purchase the Master Game add-on if he wishes to make the game more advanced.  Strat-O-Matic Baseball, on the other hand, comes with the advanced rules.  You do not need to purchase any additional products to play a more advanced game if you own Strat-O-Matic Baseball.

Terrific rule book. Charts make sense.
Maybe best for solitaire or , league play also good? Less good for FTF?
Reading comments from old APBA hands I see there's more going here then I thought such as simple pitcher grades controlling more for ERA or wins, if I have that right. also the Basic 2015 rules do allow for declaring holding the runners and ignoring steal attempts.

Unlike the old hands I can't look at an ABPA card and immediately see the player performance in it. I don't think I'm giving up yet.

As a boy in the '60s, I literally played thousands of APBA baseball games, so much so that I wore out dice cups. I could complete a 9 inning game and keep score in as little as 20 minutes.


But since acquiring the APBA Major League Baseball Master Game in 1984, I haven't gotten back to this one.

I love Strat-o-matic baseball, but I've never appreciated APBA. I'm not sure why, but perhaps it is because the version I own doesn't reflect the E.R.A. or the batting average on the face of the card: you have to  guess the value of a player by looking at the result selection, or you have to know the players independently.

My rating is based on averaging my score for the APBA Basic Game (4) and the game when adding the Master Expansion (7).  The APBA Basic game just isn't that compelling to me unless I want to replay a lot of games -- and if I wanted to do that I'd just play a computer game that sped up the process and allowed more managerial decisions.  The Master Game, however, is worth playing as a boardgame, though a slower endeavor and offers a nice change of pace from Strat (in any of its incarnations) with its more detailed outfield arm/baserunning decisions and wonderful array of rare plays.  Playing the Master Game in the board format allows you to "look-under-the-hood" in a way that computer adaptations usually fail, giving you a better sense of what is "really happening" in the game.

Fun, if you like that sort of thing. I find it entertaining, even though I don't really have much more influence on the outcome than one does in, say, Spare Time Bowling. It really is a lot like managing a baseball team. You make the lineup, you occassionally put on a hit-and-run, but otherwise, you just sit there in the dugout, and let the players play.

There are some elements that I think are really missing from the game, like pitcher fatigue, for example. If you have a great starting pitcher, he can go 15 innings for you every day of the week, and still feel fresh. That could use a little tweak. But it is fun for what it is.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
The game is very simple, and accurate. It creates great realism within the sports game community. Apba baseball is quick and easy- roll the dice and manage the team through the game. The great fun that come from the game is simple, you are the manager and it does just that.
Also i have seen that their customer service via email has been quick and rapid, even outside of their normal business hours. They provided me with information about my order without any issue which made my time waiting for the game much more easy.

This is a fantastic game for those who would like to teach some one how baseball plays or who wants to replay an entire season.

[u]20-Jan-2014[/u]: Finally!  I've been wanting a baseball game for longer than I've been into the hobby game scene.  After much debate and discussing it with one my BGG friends, I decided on this one.  After only a single play, I definitely have no regrets.

Obviously, I still don't have much experience with it yet, but my one session was great fun.  I could just see the game playing out in front of me as if I were watching the game on TV.

The rules are quick and easy to learn.  I had no real trouble jumping into my first game after one read through of the rulebook.  I definitely want to get in more plays of this one and will look to pick up one of the larger card packs to play out some longer series over time.

Excellent addition to my collection.

RATING: 7
Fun game, with detailed outcomes and stats. It can be a rather expensive investment, as a single season could run you close to $100 with all of the "extras". Inexplicably (at least on their website), certain teams and seasons are not available, like the 1908 Cubs (arguably one of the greatest teams in history) or the 1906 season (the only all-Chicago World Series). I would have really liked to have been able to play the 1908 vs. the 2008 Cubs. Rules are not terribly well-written. There are some inconsistencies between the Master Symbols on the cards and in the rules. The Master rules made it very hard to get hits, let alone extra-base hits (maybe it's because it's 1918).Update: Brooklyn outscored NY 22 to 5 in the first two games of the 1918 season, including multiple ex-base hits (so much for the deadball...) I've downrated this game because, especially in comparison to Replay Baseball, there are too many charts that need to be consulted on each play.

I had a lot of fun with this game in my preteen and teen years. I was a big sports fan and also a stat nut at a young age and this game was great at stimulating my imagination...I could imagine playing...imagine announcing the games and keep detailed stats of all the best players and teams. Endless hours were spent comparing the strengths and weaknesses of each players abilities and statistics and seeing how they performed compared to their actual season's statistics from the big leagues.

A lot of fun in it's day and although I haven't played in years still one of the best immersive gaming experiences around.

I own the latest version of this Basic Game (hot off the presses, July 2007), which includes some very good and useful changes already made to the Master Edition boards--although some might not be happy with changes in errors that will increase such totals. The main benefit of the Basic Game is that it allows one to play games fast while still getting the feel of hitting, pitching, fielding and running the bases--that is, all aspects of offense and defense in baseball. Personally, I prefer the Master Game because of its added complexity, but the Basic Game is good for cranking out more games in a shorter time, and I use it for replays that I don't care that much about the level of complexity I'm getting. Also, the rule book is succinct and extremely well written. Regardless of what's listed here on BGG, my actual plays of this game is in the thousands. In June of 2008 I completed a replay of the 1960 New York Yankees season, using cards by Francis Rose. New York finished within 1 game of its actual win total. Then the Yankees lost to the 1960 Pittsburgh Pirates in six games in my World Series replay. Great fun--took about 2 years to complete. Now (July 2008) I'm underway with a replay of the 1911 New York Giants season, using official APBA cards.

This is a nice baseball sim for kids (I first played when I was 6 or 7), better than SOM basic version due to the big boards and nice player cards. After some time, though, even basic SOM is better, I think. Pitching isn't handled well in APBA (it can't stop power or speed).

Found my son's old unplayed 1996 game last week buried in the basement (6/09). The basic game rules with a load of charts, two then-current teams and 20 Hall of Famers. Basic game more basic than Strat, plays about the same length. Wondering if it would be worth upgrading to the Master Game set-up, if I can figure out all I would need to make it so.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The basic version is overly simple perhaps, and its lack of provision for pitcher fatigue can cause gross overuse of the best pitchers. House rules are kind of necessary. But the calculation of formulas directly into the player cards makes it so simple and fun to play. Other games can get weighed down with fiddly modifiers; APBA Baseball has almost none of those. This is the baseball sim I just won't ever give up. Forget strategy, it's just all about the story that develops with each game and the fun of keeping stats.

This is a pretty good system for generating baseball games from real statistical summaries of players' past seasons.  Unfortunately it lacks any representation of a pitcher tiring over the course of an outing and therefore is missing the most interesting decision a manager gets to make.

RATING: 10
The best baseball game there is. The game does include rules for individual fielders, though it has only a single rating per position, not a rating for range, arm and fielding percentage, but the rating does affect plays to that position. The game has good batting statistical accuracy, the pitching accuracy varies wildly though which is a bit of a drawback. But the fun factor is very high, and there is nothing like rolling a 66 and knowing you just a hit a homerun without referring to a chart or card. Plus you can play a complete game in 20-25 minutes, enabling your to play a full season within a league.

A game that plays fun out of the box, but that is also great for the tinkerer as house rule opportunities abound. There is an active community for this game on Delphi Forums ("APBA between the lines"). Best played solitaire in my opinion.  With two players it's kind of awkward sitting there watching the other guy roll dice and check charts that affect your team when it's his turn; not enough decision-making opportunities in the basic game to make it interesting for two players.

The classic baseball simulation game. For fans of the sport and the stats that go with it! I score everything in a scorebook.

The old stager of baseball games. Played 100's of matches, nay 1000's actually in replays from the 90's. I do use a pitching system that does not come with the out of the box game. For me, with the batting and base stealing already incorporated, its the perfect hybrid.

Solid table-top baseball sim that's been around for years and is enjoyed by many.  Our group disliked the fact that defense was handled as a team instead of by the individual players.  I can't see why Andrew Jones would drop a fly ball because he had Javy Lopez on his team.

The basic game plays smoother and quicker than any baseball game I have played.  The basic game pitching is simplistic, but this game ranks very high on the fun scale.

This is a fun baseball game, but just a little too dry and technical compared to other games I play(ed).  I only played it for 20-30 games with some friends, and then put it away.

A little too simple for me.  Good for youngsters, but anyone over the age of 12 should just go right to the Master Game, History Maker Baseball or Strat-O-Matic.

Situational result tables create a better story and game flow than Strat. Pitching grades in Master game provide better realism. Defensive grades remain its weakest feature.

I played this for many many hours when I was a teen.  APBA baseball will give you a quick fun game based on real major league baseball teams, and you can trade players freely and even draft your own teams.

It suffers on realism though, compared to later efforts like Pursue the Pennant (now Diamond Mind Baseball, only available as a computer game).  A batter has the same chance of hitting a double or home run regardless of the pitcher.  Defense rules are primitive.  Stolen bases are essentially automatic, and "caught stealing" is far more rare than in real life.  If your pitcher has good control, he will NEVER walk a batter when there is a runner on first.

So if you want long-term statistical realism, I'd look elsewhere.  But APBA is fun to use to play a few games.

I played this many times as a kid.  Mostly solo and occasionally with friends.  Good game but much better with the Master Game Expansion.

My first stats based board game.  Absolutely loved it.  It is still fun to go back and play.  The cards are easy to read and most results can be memorized after a few games.  The draw backs for me are the limited coaching and limited variation of pitcher impacts.  For example, one D (W) is the same as another D (W) even though one may have a 4.50 ERA and the other a 7.00 ERA.  The Master game does a better job differentiating these things and I would highly recommend it.

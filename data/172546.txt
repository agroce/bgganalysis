Comparisons to Fresco are inevitable, as they have the same design team.  Parfum plays quicker than Fresco, and is very easy for a veteran boardgamer to learn and understand.

The hardcore cube-pushers will dismiss the game due to the randomness of the dice.  I say balderdash - sometimes you just need that touch of uncertainty to make a game shine.

Perhaps I would have enjoyed this more with a different theme over all the game play was decent and I wouldn't refuse to play again but wouldn't rush out to play it either. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Parfum has an interesting theme. You are contacting perfumes to sell to prospective buyers. And being designed by the people that gave us Fresco we though we might be getting a newly themed version of that great game. But Parfum falls flat in that not matter how much you plan by getting perfume components in the end you roll dice to see if you succeed. And while I don't mind games with lots of dice rolling, in a Euro like this it makes all the strategy a moot point because if you roll badly you get nothing. While it is not a game for dedicated Eurogamers, it can certainly be used as a gateway for new people just trying to get into that genre of games. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A bit too simplistic, and the dice seemed to serve no other purpose than to open up the possibility of a player getting screwed by bad rolls.  I don't think they really added anything.

RATING: 7.2
Some have complained that there's not a lot to this, and that's true, but it's a solid light gateway Euro in which you're fashioning perfumes to the desires of customers. Actually the framework of the game reminds me a little of Alchemists, only without all the deduction, depth and the app you use in that game. The dice are lovely, the actions fairly straightforward, and the theme is really cool. I wish the dice were used for a little more, and more could be done with the concept, but it functions.

This was an interesting resouce gathering and spending game.  I like how it worked and how turn order works (later you go, you get more actions). It was really solid as a two player.  Would like to try with more (I would gather it would be more chaotic, but that is okay).  As always the production is excellent with Queen.

A little bland and boring, though not a bad game. The high level of luck here would be more appropriate for a shorter filler game. As it is, too much depends on good or bad die rolls, and it just doesn't work as a "strategy" game. The game is still pretty fun to play, though, and the art and board are beautiful. I also appreciate the unconventional theme.

Fast, fun, intuitive gateway game with a solid design, beautiful components and a refreshing theme...(pun intended). Not a big fan of dice chucking but this game changed that for me. My game ratting is adjusted upward (7.2) to off set the 6.6 overall rating. This is a good game and shamefully under-rated. Well done Queen, this is a keeper for me. and at $10 it should be for most.

I am starting to like this game more and more, even though I am not very good at it.

I have a space on my shelf for dice games that use the dice for something other than "my number is better than yours".  This game uses those dice appropriately.  However, the luck element can get frustrating at times when you keep rolling "flies" instead of "potions".

RATING: 8.5
Parfum has gotten some understandably low ratings due to the luck component of the game. There are some dice rolls involved, and it can be frustrating if certain perfume components do or do not happen to surface at the opportune time. 
However, I think it may be one of my favorite family games. There is definitely some strategy involved, and the game, despite the luck is pretty engaging. And honestly, it's nice to have a game that the family gamer isn't guaranteed to win every time.

Euro que recuerda al Fresko (mismos autores) pero más sencillito, con dados y mucho azar. Ideal para mi familia que son casi todas mujeres. Ha gustado mucho a mis padres, sobre todo a mi madre y esto es que verdaderamente me importa! Eso sí, no hay que abusar de él porque me parece un poco repetitivo y puede llegar a cansar, y como los buenos perfumes, mejor en frasco pequeño y en pequeñas dosis. Así que por todo esto, se lleva un notable!

Theming a game around perfume sounded a bit odd at first, but I have to admit, it was neat: scents are sensorily evocative in a way that commodities aren't - I found myself imagining the different scent combinations while playing.

The gameplay, however, didn't do much for me. It seems fine for what it is (a 45-minute family-friendly game), just not up my alley.

Es un juego muy bonito, de unos componentes de primera. La mecánica del juego es sencilla, seleccionas tu turno, tiras los datos y vez que suerte tuviste, si lo deseas puedes usar unos tokens de gotas para modificar la tirada o volver a tirar, esta parte te permite formar los perfumes que son de 2 o 3 losetas. Después a vender perfumes.
El juego en sí es muy sencillo a no más, no hay la mega profundidad pero no con ello la diversión. Si el azar no es problema contigo este juego te puede gustar.
Lo recomiendo para jugar con la familia (si no son jugones) y querer pasar un rato a gusto.
En mi casa ha sido bien acogido.

Great game, replaces such things as Catan, Ticket to ride etc as a good gateway. Some say this is not a gateway but to me it totally is, it's so light and because of the heavy theme the bit of depth that is there makes sense intuitively. So here's a game I can enjoy as much as newcomers and they also stand a good chance of winning currently. Appeals to females amazingly well which is a real bonus

I love Fresco but it seldom hits the table due to its daunting set-up. Parfum feels like a simpler Fresco-light with an interesting and original theme. It has a bit too much randomness but its mitigated enough and the gameplay and theme make up for it. My wife and I like to name our perfumes when we complete them.

Just received this today (11/5/15) as a Kickstarter.  It looks nice enough, will see how it plays. 45 minutes is an appealing length.

Updated: Played twice. As the game stands it is very light, though nicely done.  It needs more variety, and like Fresko, I predict expansions aplenty.  For now it is a family game, or a light gateway.

This could have a been a great game with more play-testing.  It has three problems.  First, the water tokens should all have a value of 1.  The 0-3 spread is too big   Second, you should always start a round with all three bottle types.  Every game I have played there has been an issue with this.  Third, inverse the player order after bidding.  The person who buys and creates first goes last in the sell phase.  The components are top notch and the designers are better than the randomness in this design.

The game is really light, but my score has increased each time I play so there's definitely room for skill in there. 

I would love to see a little expansion or something to add a little something to this one. Just a tiny bit more complexity would make it a real standout.

This family game has a nice and unusual theme, it is not very complex, it has a significant luck factor but still allows space for planning and strategy. Probably the luck factor is a bit too high and there's nothing really new here, but actually I was somewhat pleasantly surprised by this game from the designers of Fresco. Fresco is otherwise a superior game but I'm not a big fan of it - it's nice and does work but (apart from the theme) it's nothing special and maybe too complex for its seemingly simple family-friendly approach. Parfum, on the other hand (having some similarities in structure) is really simple, also it has dice rolls which, for whatever reason, seem to make games more fun. it's light, colorful and really family-friendly; a pretty good game as a gateway to present day Euros. Maybe, and only maybe, I'm going to buy it for one of my daughters later.

I've also seen games where a player had some really bad luck early on and was able to come back and win.  Both my wife and daughter request to play this which is a win for me.

Gyönyörű kivitelezésű játék, még Queen mércével is kimagasló. Az alkatrészek használata, kivitelezése is ötletes és logikus, és a játéknak egy megkapó bájt ad. Nagyjából ennyi pozitívumot tudok elmondani. A játék maga roppant egyszerű, ami nem baj, viszont túlságosan szerencsefüggő az én ízlésemnek. Ez még talán mindig nem lenne olyan nagy baj, hiszen egy kellemes, könnyed parfümkészítésről van szó. Azonban végig ugyanazt csinálom, ami nem túl szórakoztató, és egyáltalán nem izgalmas. Sőt sokszor volt az a fura helyzet, hogy valakinek fel kéne tölteni a kínálatot, de senki sem akarta. Hát elég faramuci... A játékos sorrend azért ötletes, a kivitelezés gyönyörű, a téma pedig asszonybarát. Nem fikázom le, de ajánlhatok mást? :)

A nice light strategy game that keeps you guessing and trying to thwart off any bad luck. The game is tight and a fun experience for those looking for this type of game (set collection and dice rolling).

I knew I might enjoy this one, and I'm happy to say that was indeed the case. This felt like an extremely light Rococo, in many ways, and I really liked it for something on the lighter end of the spectrum. There are a few glaring issues though. 

One is replay value. I'm not sure that this game is going to change much from one session to the next. Another is with the dice. It's a little weird that you're rolling dice with each one giving you a 50/50 shot of succeeding, but interestingly enough, I was still captivated by this. Finally, veteran gamers will recognize fairly quickly the Power Grid-like strategy of holding back until high-scoring customers come into play. However, this means that someone needs to claim those lesser customers, so I could see this game grinding to a halt if everyone is just snagging perfume pieces. If played in the right spirit, however, I think this can be easily remedied. 

I'm a little surprised they didn't do something like limit the amount of spots you can put perfume pieces. In fact, I think a good house rule would be to have to assign them around your player board once you get them, or else toss it out as a waste. This would make people want to sell more. I also think this would have been a great game to include hidden scoring for different perfume types to encourage players to go after those kinds instead of just doing what will score you the most points.

So while Parfum isn't as well rounded as I would like, I'm seriously considering hanging onto it. Queen rarely does games I enjoy, but this is most certainly one of them. I'm just not sure how often it will hit the table due to how much of a one trick pony it is.

策略點容易掌握
主要就是根據客戶去拿對應的香水原料
然後隨時準備足夠的水滴來保證一定會製作成功
順位在要賣的時候非常重要
主要問題可能會卡在客戶跟香水板塊都是隨機
如果香水板塊都是某種位置的就沒辦法完成香水
如果客戶都沒有對應的就很拿賣
會稍微卡卡的
規則:
*圖板照人數放對應面，香水原料板塊丟袋中，顧客AB分開洗云，A疊B上，B的最後五個上面疊結束標記，補滿圖版的香水板塊跟顧客板塊，時間板塊用對應人數面擺滿對應位置，骰子放對應位置，水滴正面洗勻
*每人拿一個香水台版塊跟兩個水滴，分數標記放0
*遊戲進行數輪直到結束條件，每輪有三個階段，接輪流進行
1.起床 分數最後的先選起床標記為後面兩個階段的順位，跟行動數，分數標記疊起的上方先選
2.創造香水 輪流完成以下行動，骰子全部人都可選，用完就放回，板塊先拿先贏
>使用順位上的行動點來 抽一個新的香水板塊放在空格/一點拿一顆骰/1點拿一個水滴
>擲所有骰 棄1水滴可重擲所有骰或一個顏色的所有失敗骰，棄兩個水滴可以把1骰換成成功面，使用的水滴分數面朝上棄掉
>利用成功的骰面收集香水板塊並獲得上面分數，香水板塊可放左右來形成大小香水，可以有多個未完成的但一放就不能移動，完成的話跟劇版塊數拿對應數字(2/3)的香水標記放上面
3.販賣 照順位 輪流賣1次之後再輪流賣1次，香水有滿足對應顧客需求拿走該顧客，還一個香水標記並拿對應分數，也可直接賤賣，移除一個香水標記根據該香水板塊數拿2/3分，當有一香水賣完就獲得兩個水滴的獎勵
*下回合開始前，水滴上限4顆多的棄掉，回合標記放回原處，香水跟顧客補滿
*遊戲在結束標記出現該輪結束時結束或是回合結束時香水不夠補馬上結束，每個人加水滴上面分數
**2人**
*拿回合標記時輪流拿一個後再拿一次，行動數不能加總來做要分開成兩次，賣也是輪流最多賣到4次

For some reason that I cannot fathom the customers in the second half of the game do NOT have more complex fragrance needs, making the perfume construction more difficult and requiring more precise strategies. There are two customers with higher than normal needs and everyone else is basically the same, just worth more points. It makes little to no sense.

A game from the designers of Fresco, that was something I had to have. But it also created some high expectations and I'm afraid that those aren't met by Parfum. Therefore it's too simple,  pure family game, with not enough options. 

Not that it is a bad game, a 'typical 7' (which is for me a game I don't mind owning or playing, but ain't necessary to have). I think the problem is that while Fresco had from the start 3 modules that spice things up, Parfum doesn't have those, which makes it can't become something more then a family game. 

Maybe Queen Games is planning to release an expansion with modules (and later on the obligate Big Box :s) or extra Queenies, but then I think they made a mistake by not already including some extra's to spice things up, as for now, there ain't no reason for those who want a bit more challenge in their games to buy this.

neat core concept, but the 2p rules didn't work for us (much like the 2p rules for Five Tribes). would have much preferred a dummy player like the designer's last game: Fresco.  shame, as the core loop of the game is solid, and the components are great.  likely a very nice 3 or 4p game, but not great at 2...

You can tell that this game is from the same designers as Fresco as it feels like a fresco likely game with a push your luck feel.  The fun of the game is to push your luck of the dice or the draw of the bag and then picking that moment to take the first player to get you customer.  Not to mention there is an interesting layer of push your luck with the water tokens.  Should you use that 2 or 3 pointer early because you may just get it back again.

While closer inspection could probably tear apart the comparison, on the surface Parfum plays like a more physical and interactive Splendor (which we love). Plays great with two players and is similar to Patchwork in that there are only a couple of choices each turn but they're agonizing and have to be balanced against what your opponent is doing.

This was a high priority purchase for me given the designers created the wonderful Fresco.

Parfum uses a similar turn mechanism where the last player in the scoring gets first choice of when to take their actions, so going first gives you 1st choice of fragrance and selling, but gives you the least actions (3). Whereas going last gives you 6 actions to develop your fragrances, but you can be left with slim pickings and also could miss out on the big sell.

It uses dice to make the different fragrances needed for each bottle, and cleverly user water drops (which you can take as an action, or get as a reward for selling out of a perfume), which you can cash in to re roll, or change the die face.

Overall this seems to be an ideal game to get out for non-gamers and family, as the theme is appealing (especially to wifey!), and it is really easy to explain the rules and play. Far more do than base Fresco.

My only concerns so far in the games I've played, is that once someone gets into an early lead, it's been tough to catch up. I don't think the 'choosing your start time' at the beginning of each round provides enough of a catch up mechanism. Another issue noted is that just as you're getting into the flow of the game, the X customer is drawn, and suddenly you're in the final round.

So far a solid 7. Will need to see if the 2P variant irons out those concerns.

Parfum is a good game, but it never rises above that. It feels like a watered down version of Fresco, which makes sense. It's got some interesting decisions and the dice rolling can be enjoyable, but there just isn't enough here. It would likely work well as a casual family game.

I'm sure that were I newer to the hobby, the rating would be higher, but there's nothing really especially new here. It's a great intro Euro, as you have some good elements here: choosing your turn order and building up fragrances to score points over a couple of rounds, with turn order sometimes being critical to being able to cashing in those points. The dice add an element of luck to keep things interesting. Finally, at the risk of being sexist, the perfume theme is a good way to engage the ladies.

It's a cute game, but ultimately not for me: too much randomness (dice rolls, the order in which perfume orders appear). It reminds me a lot of [thing=66188]Fresco[/thing] (earlier turn order = fewer actions; use actions to get ingredients, put them together in specific combinations to score points) to its detriment -- I'd much rather play [thing=66188]Fresco[/thing]! This is like a simplified Fresco:
- you just have generic actions (no workers). You use actions to do various things (get dice, roll dice, add perfume components to available display)
- instead of getting money and priority in market to acquire resources, you simply use an action to get a die of the color you want ... and hope to roll the resource (3 have 50% odds, 2 have 33%)
- instead of having all VP tiles available from start, you have a deck of perfume orders that gradually appear in semi-random order

Good family game, I suppose; gamers should just go to Fresco!

tl;dr: nothing special, but works fine

A new game from the designers of [thing=66188][/thing]. And the same publisher. They also reuse a turn order mechanism that is quite similar. Go early in turn order with less actions, or go later with more actions. Simple and good. The rest of the game mainly consists of rolling dice to get resources (in the form of perfume bottle sections) which can be combined to create a perfume which can be used to score points. Nothing all that new, but it works very well. It's a tad lighter than Fresco I think, but it's been a while so I could be wrong on that.

All in all a decent family friendly strategy game that works fine but doesn't do anything new.

5th play:  Confirming that this is an underrated game.  There are subtleties in here that are not clear on the first plays.  It's very smooth mechanically and, therefore, moves along swiftly from turn to turn..  2-player games are very tense and fun.  I think, in fact, it's best with 2.  Euro-snobs beware, but for those who simply like a very well-designed family and gateway game, this can't be beat!  Wife! Girlfriend!  Daughter!  Grandma!  All are up for this superb theme.  

3rd play:  This is a superb family game.  BGG gets very tiring in its persistent snobbery toward the humble family game.  This game has:  1.  Beautiful components. 2. Wonderful art. 3.  Smooth game play. 4. Quick start-up rules--(Queen Games has mastered this art). 5. Short game time -45 minutes-60.  6. Thematically it's great for ANYBODY in the family--especially the wife and daughters.

2nd play:  So, why is this not a highly rated game?  Currently 2726 on BGG charts--i.e. unnoticeable.  Why? 1. It's not a dense, confusing game that makes your head hurt. 2.  It's not violent in nature. 3. The rules aren't 30 pages long.  4.  It's not a filler.

In other words this is an excellent family game or even gateway game.  It may cause a revolution, but BGG's rating system is not based on fun, but on game snobbery.  A new BGG is needed if this hobby is ever going to progress past it's snobo-phile reputation.

Had an early bird Kickstarter pledge and dropped it. I thought they might add in something extra, or throw in one of their shovelware games as they sometimes do (Edo, Mammut), but they didn't do that here so there's really no incentive to preorder it now when it will be much cheaper at retail. Plus, the game might not even be that good, so Queen's crappy Kickstarter may have saved me from getting the game at all.

The last straw was when they opened up a ton more early bird pledges so that every backer could get one. I don't know why they didn't just make the early bird price the price from the beginning, other than greed. To me this demonstrates that they can afford to sell the game for that early bird price, but they were hoping to take advantage of people who were willing to pay more.

Some of the other Queen Kickstarters have been good deals and have added in extras as they gained more pledges, but this one is a cheap cash-grab from an established company who should have just published the game outright.

Update: Now that the game is out, it looks like it's just mediocre at best and it has been discounted multiple times at various online retailers, so I dodged a bullet there.

** The turn-order selection may be borrowed from Fresco, but that is not near enough to consider the two games as similar. 


** I tend to shy away from dice games, but the ability to use water tokens to alter the outcome makes it palatable.


** I find it odd that Fresco has a higher BGG "weight" value.  This one can be played in a simple manner if you choose  but I say that targeted assembly of a  completed bottle for selling is more difficult than acquiring a ceiling tile in Fresco.  Fresco allows ad-hoc grouping of colored cubes while here the tiles must be grouped as soon as they are obtained.

Two games played so far.  Fun game.  Only one issue is with the water tokens.  Everyone agrees that they should go back into the bag and not be set to the side.  Using your tokens for dice rerolls and attempting to get better draws on end-game points seems like a good idea.

Collect fragrance sources, distill them successfully with mutable die rolls, combine them into perfumes, then sell them to customers interested in their scents, and willing to pay what you want for them. There are nice trade-off mechanisms to make the game fun and interesting, and to make gambles exciting.

[i][b]Example:[/b] Reroll flies of one color, or every single die, for 1 water. …or just "fix" a single die for 2 water. Due to the fickle nature of dice, it can often enough end up being cheaper to spend the 2 water per die you need, but the gamble of 1 pays off enough to keep you trying it.[/i]

[i][b]Example:[/b] Waking up early can give you drastically fewer opportunities to find fragrances and distillations you need, but gives you first crack at taking the perfect distillation or customer… if you can pull it off with fewer chances.[/i]

I suspect that the planned expansions, as with Fresco, will add depth and satisfaction to the game without drastically complicating it.

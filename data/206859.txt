Excelente juego de trenes, de subastas de las acciones de las compañías (no tiene pick and delivery), un 18xx reducido, menos complicado que sus hermanos mayores pero con bastante más complejidad que el Chicago Express por ejemplo. Buen diseño de juego, con doble mapa incluído.

Seems like it's too easy to run away with the lead and everyone grabs their next character to "get in line" to eventually take the hotelier.

The coins were also poorly designed making them all the same shape and more or less the same size. The 50s and 100s are the same size and color. Borrowing poker chips from the nearest set was an improvement and they still fail the different size and shape issues from above.

Despite this problem, money is used everywhere and is the main objective of the game.

11/11/17:  Fairly standard rail game with role selection.  The board is fixed so the starting positions of each company are the same.  What makes or breaks the game for individuals will be whether they like the role selection mechanism.  For me it just throws too much chaos into the game and does not add something that substantially enhances the game.  

The game graphical design could be better.  This is one game that reminds you that all games should be playtested in low incandescent (yellow) lighting.  It was hard to tell the brown and gray shares apart.  The number on the back of the shares which indicate how many shares are in each company is hard to see, and is not consistent. between companies.  One share of each company should be marked as the president's share so that in case of a tie in number of shares, you know who the president of the company is.

I think that a couple of roles (Don Quixote and Mafioso) can throw all your planning out the window, and seem to be chaos for the sake of chaos. In the 18xx family of games, there are those that like stock manipulation, and those who like games about running companies well.  I'm one who likes running companies well, so this sort of game doesn't appeal to me.

I also played with some very analytic types who with 5 players turned this into a 2.5 hour game counting instruction.  That's was way too long for what it delivered.

First Play: For some reason I took against the game when it was kickstarted. Something about the characters which seemed out of place or wrong. So a year later I'm pleased to say that I was wrong and it is a good game. Having said that it is an unashamed dovetailing of Chicago Express with the characters in Vanuatu but done very well so no complaints and feeling that I should have bought it. Maybe?

A derivative of Wabash Cannonball/Chicago Express, with added character powers that add effects the game, and control building rates and prices.  It worked okay, but the art was atrocious and really hindered the game play.  Various shades of brown on the cards is not a good decision.

I like this better than Chicago Express. Less fiddly and the variable character set-up/ordering can make for different strategies almost every game. There is a pay-out (only) after each auction (and double at end-game), which makes bidding interesting -  it's a huge swing between winning a share or not. Open and closed share auctions are called strategically only by the CEO of each company, unless (over?) building *forces* him/her to do it (a company *must* build or else auction every turn). Really really interesting in many ways - not just a slight rehash of other train games; you can feel this was trimmed down to the parts the designer intended, and those parts make for a  unique game.

This game is very different from other games I've played, and at first we found it weird that train companies won't give you any direct income when there's no more shares available. As we played the game however, it started to make more sense. When there's no more shares, you'll have to focus on building tracks and maybe hotels to increase the value of each share, as they will pay out double at the end of the game. I believe the character selection part is also a very important part of the game, and it might take a couple of playthroughs to learn how to make "good" selections. Definitely looking forward to play this again!

Very well done train game with cool mechanics and a somewhat grotesque artwork. I have played only one game, but the fact that not all action cards will be played in a given game and their order may change adds tons of replayability to this title.

Similar to Chicago Express but with variable player powers each turn.  The production artwork (especially on the cards) seems a little muddled with colors blending too close and making the iconography difficult to read.  I don't think this is a problem with the graphic design itself, but with the printer.

I've only played once, but with a big misunderstanding in track construction cost in the rules.   It seemed too long.  I want to play it again with the correct rule and hopefully the play time will be more reasonable.  If so, then my score should increase.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

Enjoyed this one despite playing poorly. The layout of the characters that use a Carson City-esque mechanic combined with Wabash Cannonball skin is fairly interesting. I also found interesting the piece where stocks pay out when a stock is purchased AND the company also receives a payout from the bank based on their shares. There's a fair bit to explore with two maps, a mix of characters of whom not all are in play at once, and different things to consider with different player counts. It was even interesting to see one person who was the CEO of two companies paying the other company to lay track where that other company was present to give a bit of cash. As always, this is a game about managing timing and auctions.

Interesting variant of the Chicago Express types of games. Selecting the right character is probably the most important choice in this game. Which actually makes it less of a train game. The shares mechanism is also a bit odd.

Cube railgame but the interesting twist here is role selection added each round. It's an interesting game playing around with money going in and out of your company's pockets and preferably into your own. Bases on half a game in Essen. Wouldn't ming to play this again.

Good 18xx-game which can be played with 5 in 90 minutes, so that's a big plus. The addition of the characters is nice. 

What worries me a bit is the fact that the order in which companies act is fixed (and not like in many others based on there share value) and that in combination that dividends are payed after an auction. It makes that yellow is always more favorable then grey as you can auction off early AND get a payout which you can use for possible future  auctions, while grey can't get any money from pay-outs for all auctions taking place before him.

Has the misfortune of having some of my least favourite mechanics - proliferation of open auctions, shares and train routes - all in one game. I didn’t get the lowdown when the game was suggested, but would have stayed clear if I could have. Muddy, unattractive cards and board and too much economics and resources for my liking. Quick enough, but I can’t play these sort of games with anything but mild antipathy.

tl;dr: better then expected

This game is one of those more accessible 18xx inspired train games. It does involve track building (though that part looks more like Chicago Exporess) and share auctions. There are some aspects to this game that are pretty unique.
Every round each player gets to chose one of the available character cards that gives certain advantages but also determines how efficient things like track building will be this round.
A big restriction that most games don't have is that only the CEO of a company can decide to auction a new share on that company's turn. This gives the CEO a lot of control over the company. Also, this auction is the only way to trigger dividend payout. And that in turn is the main source of income for both the players and companies (unsold shares pay out to the company).
There's a bunch of other aspects to the game, but all in all I would say this is a pretty nice design that leads to a nice and tight game that plays very well with up to 5 players.
The amount of different character cars should also provide good replay value.
One negative point though: this game is very brown. Not the prettiest thing to look at.

Yet another train and stock game. Reverse of the board is Taiwan, but the board is a fixed layout. Where IR varies from Chicago Express or similar train and stock games is that it has a number of roles controlling the cost of track and granting various powers. It's more interesting to play than CE, but while the objective of making money is clear, how to get there is cloudy--maybe too cloudy.

Iberian Rails is a train themed, route building, stock market game . While it has a lot of the traditional features of these types of games, there's a fair number of twists from the standard.

Like many of these games, players buy stock in railroad companies (which have different number of shares) with the player who controls the most stock dictating the actions of that company. The goal is most money at the end of the game.

When shares are bought they fund the company, which can then use that money to build railroads. There is no terrain cost in this game which is a bit unusual. There's also no restrictions on how track can bend or fork, however only two companies can ever be in a hex. Building the second track in a hex incurs a $10 fee. You're building a company's track to connect to cities, which determines the payout value of a company.

Unlike some other games of this type, every city is equally valuable to a railroad. The payout value of the company doesn't depend on which particular cities you've connected to, just the quantity of them. There's a chart which depicts the payout for each company based on the number of cities. Yellow scores best, then Red and Gray, then Green and Blue, and Brown scores worst.

And in IR, you don't passively get income every round. Stocks only payout when there is an auction. Players with stock, including the player who wins a share in that auction, get paid, and any unbought shares feed money into the company fund (which is a very interesting mechanism).

There's two types of cities in this game, and while the companies don't care about the difference players do. About half the cities are tourist cities. When any company builds tract to a player's hotel (which players can place on the board using a special role card) the bank pays that player $10 for every tourist city that the companies' track is connected to.

Each round of this game there is a role selection phase. Each player selects a character from a row of character cards (which never changes order). That character gives them the ability to build track, sets the number of track they can build, and the cost for each track. For example, 1 = 10, 2 = 20 (total), 3 = 40 (total). Many characters also have special abilities (there are many possible characters). Finally, characters determine which, if any, of the two auction types you can initiate. In subsequent rounds, the order that characters are selected is based on the order they were taken in the previous round. If you took a character from the end of the line last round, you'll pick last this round. If you chose closer to the front, you'll pick sooner.

And there are two types of auctions. One is the standard open auction where the money spent goes into the company's coffers. There's also a closed fist auction where the money spent goes to the CEO who is initiating the auction (or to the bank if he wins). Auctions trigger payouts (both to players and the unbought shares).

The game ends in a round when any company reaches 12 cities on their line, or when 4 companies (of the 6 in play) have no shares left. Every company pays a double payout at the game end. And then most money wins.

Many of the character roles in this game seem game changing. The hotelier for example, lets you place hotels on the board... without which the distinction between tourist cities and regular cities is meaningless. There's the mafioso who allows a player with a share in the company to pay a bribe to the CEO and take control for that turn (which the CEO can't refuse). There's the investment specialist who puts $25 into the company fund of any company he acquires a share of. And a role I forget the name of who can steal half of the closed fist auction if he bids nothing. There's some more standard characters, like an engineer or construction specialist who let you build a lot of track efficiently, or the "worker" who lets you build 2 track only, but at a fraction of what any other role would cost to do so. And apparently there are many more that could have been in play that we didn't see.

This type of train/stock market game isn't my favorite genre (although I do prefer it to train/pick-up-and-deliver). Too often, I end up playing a new one that seems only slightly different from the last one I played. Iberian Rails was a bit of a departure from that as there are a number of new twists in this game that made it stand out from other train/stock games I've played. It's still not my favorite type of game, but at least there were new interesting things to think about in this one.

Decent cube-rails game with a very sharp character selection mechanic. Unfortunately that didn't pique my interest enough to keep it around, along with a slightly awkward rule-book.

RATING: 5
Iberian Rails is another entry into the "buy shares in railroad companies" genre, e.g. Chicago Express. The opportunities for incentive manipulation in IR are constrained by the fact that only the CEO of a company - i.e. the majority shareholder - can put a stock of that company up for bid. That is unless one of the other shareholders in that company has the "Mafioso" role, in which case they can pay off the CEO to make decisions for the company this round.

Yup, what sets IR apart is the role selection mechanism, a phase at the beginning of each round that feels like a Euro game unto itself. If this sounds intriguing to you by all means try Iberian Rails; my concern is that the role powers dilute and ultimately override the spatial and shared incentive considerations that make games like Chicago Express so intriguing. Following the recent trend in game design, IR mistakes extra layers of mechanics for depth, and takes an open-ended style of game rife with interactive subtlety and bludgeons it into a claustrophobic neo-Euro.

Very good game of economics, bidding and area control.  Love the 'role' mechanic where what role you assume during the round determines both what actions you can take and what advantages you gain.  
Not for the faint of heart.  It is a cut-throat game. Happy with my KS of this one.

Update:  Rating upped to a 9.  

The more I play this the more I believe the heart of the game is your role selection strategy.  And that makes this a much more layered economics game than it looks like at first.

Certainly one of the most adorable games I own, because of that artwork, but it's also fun hand management and one of those situations where one person is going to lose, and you do not want to be that person and accrue three Indigestion tokens. The theme is cute but it doesn't matter all that much.

This is a very simple push your luck card game where you try to avoid eating dishes that will make you draw the indigestion card. It's a good combination that is very simple but mashes hand management and push your luck seamlessly.

It's an ok game...kind of UNO-esque. I really like that it can handle a lot of players, but when people start getting knocked out, they end up having to sit and wait for the rest of the players to continue. If I had played it before buying, I'd probably have passed, but it's fine for an occasional game.

Very simple and fast card game when you need to fill some time but don't have the time to start an epic hour+ game. Kind of a fun spin on the Uno-style game where you are trying to get other players to eat too many cards and find indigestion cards sprinkled throughout the deck.

This game had some potential.  Unfortunately you have to push your luck when drawing cards hoping to not get the "whammy"..thus giving you more ammo to avoid the next whammy.  Reminds me a lot of UNO except picture a "whammy" card in the draw pile. Draw that 3 times and the game is over...least whammy's wins.  I'd play it again, but no desire to seek it out.

RATING: 5
First few hands are fun but once you've played it, you quickly begin to see the game's limitations. Because chances of a tie in the end are high, you'll want to make sure to have the most cards to win. As soon as players realize that, they spend more time "eating" cards rather than playing cards from their hands. Slows the game a lot thus diminishing the desire to replay it.

The art and theme is great. It's interesting that you want to take cards, but that it comes with a risk. In the end it feels broken, with a few people picking up around 5 cards for a few rounds until it becomes too risky, then someone is stuck with 40 cards and then they never pick up cards ever again. Weird game, but simple fun with family.

Pretty simple push-your-luck game. Definitely luck of the dra involved but it's fun to just see the entire table be so involved whenever people have to reveal cards from the stack.
We got loud :)

Really requires specific circumstances to shine but do think it can be fun with anything between 3 and 7 players (or whatever's supposed to be the upper limit). Probably better with more though.
One of these silly games that can create fond memories.

Überaschend!
Ein "kleines" Kartenspiel mit Can't stop Mechanismus!
Wer an der Reihe ist spielt eine passende Karte aus (2er auf 2er, 5er auf 5er, Sonderkarten) oder muss so viele Karten vom Zugstapel nehmen, wie die Summe der ausliegenden Karten angiebt. Wer Karten zieht hat danach eine größere Auswahl, aber auch das Risiko eine rote Karte vom Stapel zu ziehen, die die Runde beendet und einen Minuspunkt einbringt.
Am Ende gewinnt der mit den wenigsten Minuspunkten. Gleichstände werden nach Anzahl Handkarten aufgelöst.
Ich fand dieses Spiel überraschend gut, das hätte ich nicht erwartet.Ich hatte die Strategie nie zu ziehen, wenns nicht unbedingt sein muss, was mich um alle Handkarten brachte und ich ziehen musste ROT!
Jede Runde kommt eine rote Karte mehr in den Stapel, das am Ende einem Spieler das Genick brach, denn er musste mehrere Karten ziehen (>10) und es waren 3 rote darunter (-3 Punkte), womit das Spiel auch beendet wurde.

Tem-Purr-A is what you'd get if you stuck Uno, trick-taking games, and push-your-luck games in a blender. This isn't a particularly well-designed or solid game, but the chaos and fun makes it very appealing. When you make someone have to draw upwards of 30 cards, you can't help but laugh. I would much rather play this over something like Uno, and the ease of entry makes it so just about anyone can play.

Perhaps the Iello game that just isn't for me. I can't say I enjoyed this one very much. Wanted to play and love it if only for the art. The adorable kittens drew me and I was hooked. I can't say the game play was very interesting. There are so many card games that I like better and I have no real reason to come back to this one.

It's a nice party game.
Just get others to eat as many cards as possible, so they have the bigest change to draw a red card.
Maybe when you play this with real food and/or drinks it may be even more fun.

I like how fast this game is, its also fairly strategic. Its definitely got an element of "push your luck", where you can either play a similar card now and hope it forces someone to eat, or eat the pile now while the number is low and risk getting indigestion. Super fun quick game!

Lighthearted and a bit convoluted and obese take on Pairs - as the fat kittens would suggest. A push your luck game where you don't want to draw certain "trap" cards, but it takes a while (of Uno like play of numbered cards) to get there. I guess the whole point of Uno-meets-risk-taking is that you get a lighthearted autopilot game, but here and there, not so often, when tension occurs, it feels stronger (than in Pairs). 

Still, seems a bit long-ish and bloated-ish for what it is.

RATING: 5
This is a push your luck game.  You want to avoid drawing the indigestion cards, but you need to get cards in order to have more options and avoid having to draw cards.  The deck starts with 1 indigestion card.  Whenever someone draws it, he gets an indigestion token and has the option to add another indigestion card into the deck.  The game ends when one player gets 3 indigestion the game ends and the winner is the one who has the fewest indigestion tokens.  Most cards is the tie break.  To avoid having to draw cards, you need to play an appropriate card which is why you want to draw cards.  When you want or have to draw cards, you draw the number of cards equal to the total card value of the played pile.  You may end up drawing an indigestion card.

The push your luck mechanic is what this game is about.  Do you draw more cards which give you more options to avoid drawing cards later, or do you hold back and hope someone else gets indigestion?  The strategy is rather simple to figure out.  I played this game twice with the same group of people.  The second play, everyone figured out the basic strategy and is pretty much doing the same thing to set up.  It does get a little more interesting when some players are on the verge of getting the third indigestion card.

Uno +. It's silly, fast, and plays a crowd. The push your luck mechanism is really satisfying. We play with the "1 indigestion and you stop drawing" variant because it tightens the game up a bit, otherwise someone can go from 0-3 tokens in one turn and that's not great.

Addendum: turns out you can break the game pretty easily in the opening turn if you manage to get 20+ cards eaten. The whole table has to commit to not letting the total get there or it can be over as soon as it starts.

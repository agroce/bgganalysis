So sad about this one. The Goonies has always been my all time favorite movie and I backed this game on KS just because of the theme, not necessarily because of gameplay. I was still hoping it would be a good game but sadly it kind of fell flat. Just seems like the theme is tacked onto it and I don't feel like I'm actually the Goonies trying to find One-Eyed Willie's treasure. Not an awful game... just nothing too special besides the theme.

Abstract coop like [thing=823][/thing]. Plays more smoothly and feels a little more evocative of its theme than that game. A 5 or 6?

Another excellent offering from The Fleeples (Ben Pinchback and Matt Riddle). Silky smooth, elegant design.  The theme shines through very well. Lots of decisions to make for such a quick game.  Works well as a true solo experience (you don't need to play multiple characters).  A must buy for solo gamers, Cooperative Gaming fans or fans of The Goonies.  I happen to be all 3. Thanks for a great game Ben and Matt.

Rather abstract and a bit lacking in theme.  Satifyingly challenging.  Just not quite what I was expecting...

Best group meeple ever! Nice thematic co-op, a little too easy. I really enjoyed one play, but the puzzle wasn't compelling enough for repeat plays.

So far a really nice filler of a card game.

More choices and potential ways to win (and lose) than I originally thought.  Simple and fast enough to teach easily, but enough game there to make choices VERY important.  Sloth always helps so much! (Just like in the movie :))

Thanks Albino Dragon!  Goondocks keep on giving!

Love this game.  Production of cards and bits is excellent.  The game play really fits the theme and best of all the solo play is smooth and fun.  You'll want to watch the movie again after playing the game.

This is a great cooperative card game. Easy to teach. Every game places out differently. It's excellent as a solo game.

RATING: 6.03
First play was a mess.  Second one went much better.  Overall cardboard to monetary value is quite low on this, I think this is the worst empty box game I own.  Furthermore its really not that easy to read the rules and for a game based on a childhood classic its really ridiculously hard to learn.  The game play once you get past all that is ridiculously simple and very low tension.  The game feels like it plays itself at times, and decisions just don't seem to mean much.  Nor does it feel like the Goonies.  Which is awkward because it's not a copycat of another game either.  I think there were good intentions behind this game, and that it can be enjoyable as a lighter family game for a family with gamer parents and kids that have exposure to a wide range of gamer games.  But that's a rather limited audience.

I'm a huge Goonies fan, so this was right up my alley. I played it at PAX West and couldn't pass it up. I got the playing mat with it and love it.

The game is quick to learn and the playtime helps draw people in. I have only played on the default setup thus far and it has been great every time. This was the first Co Op board game that I've played. It was hard to get out of the habit of sabotaging the other players.

I'd recommend this everyone that is a fan of the Gonnies. The price point makes it a no brainer.

A Nice game I primarily play solo (with multiple characters). You need to take maximum advantage of your characters' abilities while clearing obstacles and exploring locations. Card advantage is a big deal so choose your (number of) actions wisely. Escalate phase and encounters can really mess up your plans but this also keeps you on your toes. Good game and admit it... who doesn't like The Goonies asa theme?

I have tried this half a dozen times solo, it was so luck based that I would rather have sat there and read a book instead. This was a nostalgic purchase and it is fun looking through the pictures, but unless I have missed something in the rules (unlikely as I kept re-reading them to try and find what I had missed) this game has no balance at all.

The movie was fantastic. The game is not. At least it's short, as you will lose real quick.

Played many games of the prototype. It's a clever cooperative game with different player powers. I would liken it to a card game version of Forbidden Island. Great use of the theme. Tons of fun.

Rated after only one solo play, so rating may adjust.  So far I'm liking it as a light co-op card game.
UPDATE - Bumped rating to 8 after playing 7 games. This game is very addictive!

We played three times, back-to-back. Lost pretty badly each time. We are not sure if we are playing this one incorrectly or not (can't find anything we missed in the rules). But the randomness of the game seems to be something that is nigh-upon impossible to plan against.

 Better be good! My daughter would play this!

Update: Not entirely sure about gameplay, I've heard it's solid. We are all big Goonies fans, especially my daughter. The one soloable game my daughter would not have to be coaxed, much, to play.

Currently on Kickstarter. It looks more fun, now that I've taken another look. I wonder . . . .read a couple reviews, too, so I am reassured. Though solo needs improvement, apparently, so it may not be the best, here, for this exchange. The guild will likely, someone, develop a better variant, though. Can't count on it. I'd say, the Solo is in beta currently, as is.

Fun, family style coop with enough decisions to keep it interesting for a bit.  Short game, and that helps as it is very luck dependant.  Fans of the movie will like this.

I enjoyed this, but the theme could have been anything. It didn't feel like anything having to do with The Goonies. Not story wise, not nostalgia wise. A decent card-based puzzle to solve, so I'll pull it out again some time. But I'm deducting 0.5 for really having nothing to do with the theme, given that was the marketing draw they were going for.

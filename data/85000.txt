Eh. This feels exactly alike other games in this series, but with different names affiliated with the squares and cards, that's all. It's disappointing to me for an odd reason... but people like this stuff.

RATING: 9
Excruciating! You can be sitting there with all the tracks at the maximum and the Allied armies far in the distance then all of a sudden they're on your doorstep and your resources are all at zero. Tough to win and the mix of cards provide variety. As has been said some of the choices are obvious, especially in the early war but as things progress you very often find that there are multiple "obvious" choices and all of them need urgent attention!

Component quality is surprisingly good, the map is on thick paper and is nicely printed. My only gripe is the card that the cards are printed on is rather rough so they tend to stick together, card sleeves would solve that though.

My rating is for the game with the expansion. The expansion adds a point.
This is rooted deeply into the history with interesting player choices. The game has 9 battles (ex: Iwo Jima, Okinaw, Pearl Harbor) and you can risk an action to risk getting better than the historical result, although there is a 33% chance you will do worse.
This has 3 tracks (oil, prestige, army-navy agreement) to manage. If all 3 ever get to "0" you instantly lose. If army-navy and oil end a turn at 0, you lose. If either are 0, you only get to conduct 1 attack against a front.
Unlike most state of siege games, you almost certainly will not lose until the third and final epoch. You start the first one coming out like gang-busters, just as Japan did historically. Then you hold on for dear life. That means this one is going to run longer than most of them -- probably all of the ones that haven't been made into large box gold banner upgrades. The expansion removes that and offers scenarios.
It is hard to play this topic in a solitaire format, but this one does it. It also does it in a simple format while staying true to the history. It is great design achievement.

RATING: 7
A very challenging but highly "scripted" game, where you basically make decisions about which of a limited number of tracks to roll on, with every roll being some number or less on 1D6, and your choices being about trying to maximize the effects given your odds. Despite being a fairly simple AI, it really does give the thematic feel of Japan being constantly encroached upon by the ever more powerful Allies as its resources dwindle.

Distills the essence of the Pacific War into a neat little package. All the main elements you would expect to find in a game on the Pacific War are here. 

Good way to pass the time if you are between games but suspect the game could become a bit of a die rolling excercise with some limited decision making.

First Impression: One does not play this game due to the components. They are nothing to write home about being only a step above PnP. This game is my first foray into the States of Siege series and I found it interesting. This is a good method of learning about the generalities of the conflict in the Pacific theater. However, I never found the actual gameplay compelling. After a short period of limited chances to prepare, the pressure begins and the game revolves around trying to mitigate the inevitable losses. I feel that this game would have been better if there were more decisions to make on how to slow down the losses. Reading through the cards after my plays, I don't feel compelled to play the game again.

Playtest version: An interesting riff on the SoS system. Here as the ruling Japanese clique you push outwards hoping to crush the Chinese, Americans, Dutch and British, but as time passes you'll find the pressure coming the other way. The huge theatre of war is handily reduced into a small map with quick-playing times and an addictive need to "just turn one more card".

Although I only got to play 2/3 of a game as of yet, this is a well crafted game, full of historical flavor and shifting difficulty.  For obvious reasons, I am very fond of the States of Siege system, but this game takes it to a while 'nuther level and models a conflict that historically has been very hard for game designers to tackle.  Steve's done a great job on this one and not only is a must for any collection, but its a game sure to be played time and time again.

Steve Carey's first published design is a winner! Taking on a huge (and always controversial, in that everyone has an opinion on this campaign!) subject, the Pacific War, the designer uses the by now well-established 'States of Siege' system showcased by VPG to add to the richness that this system allows each of its subject campaigns (and 1 battle!). Graphics, cards (and their interplay & options) and rules are superb, and WMTtE carries the high standard, drama & frustration (in a good way!) of Ottoman Sunset and moves it forward. Bravo Steve & Alan!

RATING: 8
After one play:
one of the better efforts from the State of Siege series, with enough choices/decisions to be taken by the player to make it feel that you're not just reacting to what's going on, you have a hand in shaping the direction the game is taking.
Same basic engine as the other games in the series (which makes picking up the game rather quick), but with some additional tracks that give a real choice to the player as to how to spend his action points: push back the ABDA force early so as to get the oil flowing? Spend points in growing the three tracks, more specifically the Army-Navy track early in the game to get that crucial +1 DRM? Get the Oil track to 6 so you can get +1 DRM against that Front which is getting too close? Lots of fun and decisions in a small package.
Only negative comment still remains the over reliance on dice, which sometimes makes the game feel way too out of control, If you can't roll a 6 for your life, stay away.

Fun light solo wargame. Yes luck plays a big factor in this game but I was having too much fun learning about this exciting period of history to care (and it's better if you say "risk management" instead of "luck-driven" anyhow). I also like the fact that you have to balance between pushing back allied units and making sure army/oil/prestige don't go to zero.

I'm generally not a fan of Victory Point Games' "States of Siege" solitaire system, but this one is actually pretty good. It's still not great, but it's definitely the best of those I've tried. The resource point sub-game adds another layer to a game system that needed another layer. It probably still needs another layer even beyond that one.

I'm disappointed with the way the game handles the named battles. You choose whether to spend an action to roll on the table, but most of the battles are not worth fighting. Perhaps rolling shouldn't cost an action? Or perhaps there should be a chance to gain a more decisive advantage?

Just arrived. First impressions really good. We'll see this Saturday.
After four games I won the historical scenario (without adding the expansion kit) by three lucky die rolls. Hard to win, not enough actions by mid and late play to fight back allied armies and keep prestige, army-navy and oil running.Interesting enough if you are a Pacific theater fan and understand there is life beyond WIF, Victory in the Pacific and Asia Engulfed. Despite lacking the depth of the classics shows rather well the desperate situation of Japanese forces when American war machine starts putting on pressure. Have yet to try the expansion kit with A-bombs and even soviets

RATING: 7
We Must Tell the Emperor is a States of Siege game focusing on the Japanese war efforts in the Pacific theater of WWII.

I have only played a couple of the SoS series, but this is the cleanest and neatest playing of the SoS simulations I have played.

The Event Cards are broken into 3 decks, with only a few preset cards, and the rest randomly distributed in each deck.

The game shows the Imperial forces from their heights in the early war, and players try to bring them all the way to the end, maintaining military, morale and crucial oil supplies in the face of an ever strengthening Allied threat.

The cards can have an immediate effect in forces progressing towards the Home Islands, as well as on Resources available, and either can spell the end of the Japanese war efforts.

Steve Carey did a pretty terrific job of reducing campaigns and battles into his Event cards, and the game does a nice job of presenting quick-playing, abstracted WWII Pacific history, in a very portable package.

The Artwork is not up to their more recent Gold standard, but the gameplay is, and this title definitely could be of interest to players looking for a quick solitaire with a WWII theme.

I'm starting this at a 7, but I think with plays with plays this could go up, because this seems one of the better VP titles I have played so far.

It's a shame that the designer pulled the rights, but if gamers get the chance they should try this one.

Good things come in small packages.  I am not a heavy wargamer, but the topic and execution of WMTTE intrigued me, and I gave it a shot.  I'm glad I did.  This is a neat, fairly simple game.  Players are forced into making tough decisions on every turn, and the Allied tide grinds away with a feeling of inevitability.  I would say that winning is tough, but by no means impossible.  For the price paid, WMTTE provides a lot of entertainment.

RATING: 7
A bit fiddly (token/chit management every round - perhaps a good intro to bigger wargames!). There are more resources to manage & more decisions to make compared to Ottoman Sunset. The Early to Mid to Late War phases manages to put across the increasing difficulty faced by the Japanese very well. Seems dice-dependent at times (Battle cards, but you don't have to play them), and as the game progresses, it becomes quite a major factor (Banzai attacks, Oil rolls, Prestige etc).

La primera parte, asequible, consigues objetivos sin problemas y por decirlo de alguna forma el control es tuyo. Ahora... en la segunda la cosa cambia y a mi parecer lo único que hace que cambie y la cosa se complique es el tema del modificador por los submarinos americanos de -1 a cualquier tirada de recursos... el -1 es sufrible, pero llevable, ahora el -2 de la ultima parte de guerra es imposible practicamente solventarlo.

Consegui llegar a la penultima carta pero por desgracia al revelarla China consiguio entre en Japon sin tener forma de detenerla, para mi modo de verlo importantisimo tras la primera parte de la guerra tratar siempre de disponer de los dos bonus por aceite y prestigio, son un salvavidas.

Escribo ahora la reseña y me doy cuenta de que tevu un fallo garrafal, aplique el DRM de los submarinos a todas las tiradas de la partida cuando me acabo de dar cuenta de que ese modificador es solo para los recursos por lo que ahora si esoy completamente seguro de que me podría haber terminado el juego de forma positiva.

Me queda otra cosa clara tras jugarlo y comprobar los efectos de todas las cartas, la suerte me acompaño y tanto el modificador de -1 como el de -2 de la tercera epoca aparecieron en ambos casos al final de sus mazos los que hizo que casi jugase dichas epocas sin contar con dicho modificador negativo, de salir pronto creo que complica y mucho la partida.

Le auguro bastantes partidas mas al jueguecillo que como bien han comentado es un constante asedio sobre el jugador y hace que cualquier decisión tomada pueda ser crucial. Tan pronto con una toirada consigues que retroceda uno de los frentes como que te gasta 4 acciones y no has conseguido nada de nada, ahi el dado tiene bastante que decir.

Juegazo, el primero de Victory que pruebo aunque tengo en espero el Keep up the fire, y Zulus y el Israel independenci.

Para los que gusten de solitarios y puedan hacerse con el, totalmente recomendable.

PRO:

    Juego con muchas tensión.
    Jugable en aproximadamente 1h.
    El espacio necesario es reducido.
    Sensación de que te estan invadiendo y no puedes hacer nada.


CONTRAS:

    La calidad de los materiales (dista bastante de los medio normales).
    Que el juego no incorpore la expansión, para lo que aporta creo que deberia ser parte del juego (2 o 3 escenarios y la posibilidad de jugar la partida en modo facil, medio o dificil).
    No tenerlo si te gustan los solitarios guerrilleros.

Excellent Game!!!  Follows the feeling of the Japanese war effort very closely and has enough choices to feel that the destiny of the Japanese is in your hands but without straying from script too much.  B-29 Raids in the end game are DEVASTATING and feel devastating.  My only qualm would be length considering this is a SOS game, but this is a qualm only because the play time will allow for less plays.  Absolutely excellent game!

3/3/16 -- Update
Finally traded this one away.  Great game, but slightly dated when compared with the newer SOS titles.  It's still interesting -- the fact that I just traded it makes we want to play it again -- however, the length makes me balk at this one when deciding to pick up a VPG title.

I have played Asia Engulfed, Empire of the Sun, Flat Top, and various other WWII Pacific games and enjoyed them all.

There are a few things that I enjoy about We Must Tell the Emperor. It is a solitaire game and it can be played in or about a hour. It sets up quickly and the rules are short. Most of all you get the feeling the Japanese must have felt as the war developed.

Talking to the designer, Steve Carey, he put into the game many items that require the player to make decesions that will effect the course of the war for Japan. He likes to call it his "decision tree".

Good job VPG and designer Steve.

I am becoming a real fan of the States of Siege system, and We Must Tell the Emperor is an excellent addition to the series. It is a brilliant solitaire experience. The card mechanics take you through this great conflict and you are under pressure as you watch events unfold. This is not an easy game to win and you will find yourself wanting to have another go and another after that.

There is a sense that you are just biding your time and hoping for the best. Having said that you do have choices to make and these can be critical. The history is presented well, the key events are there. This is not a deep game and works very well as a rather light war game.If you struggle to find time to get more detailed and complicated war games to the table, this makes a nice alternative. You can play it through in an hour or less and have a very satisfying experience.

You get a lot of game in a small package. I don't know that I could ask anything else from a game using the Victory Point Games production model. Steve Carey has designed one of the best solitaire games that I have ever played and I look forward to playing more in the series.

RATING: 7.5
Solo game that recreates the end days of Japan.  This is my third game in the States of Siege series from Victory Point Games and interestly enough, the toughest.  I would rank the 3 I have played as follows: 1. Israeli Independence - Easy (too easy); 2. Zulus on the Ramparts - Easy to Moderate; 3. We Must Tell the Emperor - Hard.  The designers are up-front in the rules and say the game is hard.  However, given that Israeli Independence has optional rules to make it easier (i.e., extra offensives) , I found it odd that We Must Tell the Emperor did not have a similar "crutch."  Having said all this, I will say that each are enjoyable, with We Must Tell the Emperor the best and Zulus on the Ramparts a close second.  Also, even though I believe this to be a hard game, I have had a Decisive Victory . . . will a whole lot of lucky rolls . . .

Challenging game that constantly requires tough decisions and gives a good feel for Japan's fortunes in each of the early, middle and late war periods. Being solitaire, one misses the interaction with other persons, but the game definitely works within Victory Point's "State of Siege" system. Purchased new, December 2010, as the ratings are very high and I have a particular interest in WW2/Pacific, plus this is solitaire but not complex. Three strikes to the good, in my book.  I found in particular with this game that a careful reading (and some marginal notes) of the rule book before playing is very helpful. The rule book is pretty clear on the whole, but there are a lot of particulars to absorb.  On the whole, this game system is abstracted in a way that doesn't appeal to me like a more standard block or hex/counter war game would. After my 10th play, February 2013, I raised my rating from 6.5 to 7. The game doesn't play ME, i.e., it gives me challenges and choices that seem realistic, i.e., events occur realistically and make it extremely hard for the Japanese to win, especially as the war progresses. But cards come up in different sequences with each new play, which act to bring their own set of circumstances. Therein lies the appeal. Acquired the expansion, August, 2012. [Side comment, Feb. 2013: Designers should neither rate their own games, nor list their number of plays.]

First impression after just one play: I don't know but at first glance I have the impression that the decisions are more or less obvious and I did not feel much in control. Of course if I know the deck better I will have a better idea what will/could happen where, but still I would simply follow the probabilities of future attacks which is not interesting at all.

RATING: 7
Historically solid and interesting campaign game. Don't have much empathy for Japanese in WWII, so glad to see you regularly get smashed playing them here.

Doesn't quite match my favourite SOS title, Ottoman Sunset, as it is a little long for its low-complexity mechanics, while the decision making is a bit scripted to bring the tension to the surface. One thing I really liked about OS is that the decks were shuffled into existing decks at random turns during the game. In We Must Tell, decks must be played right through in order (Early/Mid/Late war). So you know EVERY card is going to come up in its era. Historically, great, but decreases tension. I really liked trying to avoid the big, bad cards until near the end of the game. Also needed a mini-game and a bit more to think about beyond just two main decisions - attack or resources.

Still, got it for a steal ($25) and have enjoyed the play throughs so far.

RATING: 7
This is quite a challenge!  The more I play it the more I like it. The importance of keeping Nimitz out of the Solomons so that Japan can build its Solomons fortress has been a big part of each of my games.  So the Solomons Campaign (Guadalcanal, etc) has been an issue that lasts through several turns in a back an forth struggle.  I also realized the importance of keeping Japanese resources at a high level.  Most of my defeats have come from lack of resources.

A nice, light solitaire game with simple, easy to remember mechanics. Maybe too simple. All solitaire games are ultimately about going against the dice, but it's a little too transparent here. Sometimes the game felt like, 'flip a coin heads up four times in a row to win.' I guess it needed a little more decision making to disguise it's fundamental nature.

There is a strategy (involving Britain) that seriously calls realism into question, but if you can pretend that front isn't happening, the rest of the game works remarkably well for narrative purposes, and the whole thing is bloody fun to play. The whole Army-Navy/Prestige/Oil subgame makes this feel like a high-level political simulation and not just a 'wargame'. A (nearly) unqualified success!

Okay, played this half a dozen times. If you like: solitaire games, want to burn thru the PTO in an hour, like some history mixed in with your dice rolling then you will really like this game.

I am still undecided as to how much actual decision making there is.  Seems like most choices are pretty obvious given the situation and current DRM's.  If you don't go for knockout and instead try for surival you basically need to keep all armies away from Japan and all markers >0.  Because of that, it is almost always in your best interest to push the counter with the positive DRM.  When that is not appropriate, the choice is pretty obvious (i.e. there is an army on Japan).

That having been said, there are not many games that fill this niche so its appearance is most welcome.

If you like the States of Siege series, you are gonna like this game!

From te start on the tension builds while you are trying to find the best strategy to keep all the Allied "invaders" at bay, and protect the Home Islands. A bold General might even try to achieve a Military Victory in the Early stages of the War. Once the War gets in its next stage, the game gets tough on you! But even if the situation seems completely lost, the game will still grap my attention and hold it until the end.

This game simply rocks!

A great entry in the States of Siege series. The game 'passport' you can download from BGG really adds to the narrative giving a full page of background with maps and developer's commentary on each card.

My first State of Siege game - which definitely does a good job of simulating the rise and fall of Japan in WW2.  I still struggle with how much strategy is actually involved (a common complaint of the SoS game - but this one seems to have less options)

That being said, I do enjoy it - and love its portability.  I take it with me when I travel for business.

Abstractly covers the war with good detail for a game its size. The modest (but not simplistic) level of complexity makes for fast play, which usually becomes quite desperate toward the end against overwhelming enemy advances.

An absolutely wonderful game.  Easy to learn but will beat you senseless trying to master it.  Very suspensful game play.  If you are looking for a quality solitaire wargame, this is one of them.

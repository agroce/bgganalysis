An aggressively overpriced product; feels very much like half of a core set, at the price of some fully fledged board games. This could be forgiven if the scenarios provided some seriously engaging thrills. Unfortunately, it was pretty lukewarm. Not for me.

A great intro to a promising board game franchise. Deck-building is less of a focus here than in the LOTR LCG... the trade-off being better casual play and superior thematic narratives. I like the campaign model -- leveraging experience points, trauma, cultists transferring between scenarios. Although it does remove some replayability, the different investigators, location cards, upgrade possibilities, and potential endings give it some legs.

I went ahead and ordered the entire Dunwich Legacy expansion series.

This is an excellent game, but I can't justify the investment for an LCG. I'd rate it 8.5 if it were more affordable, and a 9.5 if I loved the theme.

It's really, really thematic, gorgeous, and compelling. I just miss deckbuilding aspects from, say, LotR LCG. I don't really get attached to characters in the way I get attached to decks I've built.

Solid game with a lot of interesting mechanics. Only 7 stars because of the blatant cash grab and product mismanagement by FFG. Having a great deckbuilding and story experience with only one core s is a LIE. Edit: went down to 6 stars. Game feels to shallow after a while, replayability is low.

Bought Arkham Horror The card game recently. And played Night of the Zealot Scenario. I am very satisfied with the game itself. Cards are good designed, token and other parts quality made. And replaybility is high. The only flaw is that in the core set there are only 3 scenarios and it is over too quickly.

I have played Arkham Horror: The Card Game three times.  This is basically Arkham Horror in a card game format.  I mean, it's the giant, fiddly Arkham Horror game, in a smaller and slightly less fiddly version.  This, like Arkham Horror, is like an interactive story.  I enjoy this more than Arkham Horror.  Also, this version seems more story driven than Arkham Horror.

Rules are good and very solid. Artwork is great and the theme is awesome. Great storytelling as well. Still have to try out the whole build your own deck and experience thing, but I believe this game has a lot of potential. Tried the first scenario and it went very well...till I got an unlucky draw during the Mythos phase and went mad. Still great fun and I am looking forward to play more. 
Getting the first english expansions in Germany proved a bit difficult. And that is the only reason why I did not buy them. I still want to play them all ;)

I don't know how this game is getting consistent 7s and 8s from people. Other than the fact that it is continually hyped into the stratosphere, word should've gotten around by now that the hot new Arkham game is pretty thin.

Let's start with the good, because the bad is everything else:
-Nice component quality.
-Cards have interesting art and decent graphic frame design.
-Premise looks promising; you and a friend have crazy shit happen to you in the Lovecraft universe via story narratives and you move around locations finding clues and doing *stuff* to the world.
-Deckbuilder where you can spend earned points to better your deck, so there's clearly an incentive not to fail.
-Five unique characters with (probably) different play styles.

The everything else:
-A turnoff for me was the extremely poorly written rules. There are 3 separate books and each one repeats information from the others, with the main book repeating itself several times. It was an absolute boring slog to get through them and actually took me 2 days. It's nearly impossible to read this game's rule's without becoming more bored.

-Too easy. The game's difficulties don't add difficulty at all. There's no requirement for players to master the systems or become incrementally better as they step up the difficulty. It's just a measurement of arbitrary masochism, and by that I don't even mean interesting masochism: just "how likely do you want your failure rate?"

-The cheapness. Despite being mindlessly easy to blow through the scenarios getting a perfect outcome, several events in the game feel "cheap". In one instance of the game, after it had ended Roland took a permanent point of mind damage (Mental Trauma) because his personal weakness came out AFTER all clues had been investigated (majority by him, mind you) and he could literally not meet its conditions because he succeeded too well. He was permanently damaged outside of the game's actual play. Then once AGAIN when he suffered another mental trauma while reading the resolution rules. So many times, you will have insanely cheap things happen to you that you can do nothing to either prepare for nor mitigate because they happen outside of gameplay. Some of which feels unintentional and lazy. Some of which feels like "fuck whoever plays this, they'll just have to deal with it". I'd like to remind the reader, this game was trivially easy no matter how it was played. One last cheap mechanic is the red tentacle token. I've seen other reviews saying it's the bane of the fun in this game and...it IS. An auto fail isn't fun. It isn't tense. No matter how many mental gymnastics a designer or fan tries to do, auto-failure in a game about risk vs reward is just loony.

-The narrative is shit. I don't usually straight up curse out a game in my reviews but fuck this game's disgusting writing. It reads like a 6th grader whose dad told him about a Lovecraft story he read one night, then the kid tried writing his own the next day at school. Go and read these cards, they're absolutely comically bad. We laughed at our table when anything had to be read to progress. This is coming from a group that's used to both board games and RPGs; of which this is neither. It's clearly trying to be an RPG accessible to board gamers and its failing magnificently.

-The deckbuilding isn't. You basically never need to change much of anything. Sure, you can but it won't make a huge difference until endgame. The 'difficulty' does ramp up as you play but the deck only changes by a couple points worth of cards. It's a slow roll that never quite has any satisfying payoff.

-Cheap assembly. This game comes with barely enough to play, and even that amount feels underpackaged. You get a couple sheets of tokens (more on this bullshit later) and around 250 total cards. But then you split the cards into a Mythos deck, 5 player decks, and OH WE FORGOT TO MENTION: since we're being cheap here, you can't play any two characters in the core that leech from each other's color. Because screw you, we don't feel like including extra copies. The game feels spread too thin among all its cards and definitely begs you to buy one of the expansions immediately. No more is this apparent than when you realize it only has 2 scenarios to play, one of which ends in about 15 minutes. So the entire game is just replaying the same bullshit over and over...I guess at a "harder" difficulty with slightly different cards?

-The chaos bag is just a fucking die. The game, advertisements, and reviewers have all played up the chaos bag as some innovative mechanic for randomization. It's not. It's literally a die with a custom number of faces. That's neither good nor bad. It just is. While playing, we realized it would be a lot more fun if you removed the tokens from the bag when picked until all were picked. This strictly changes the game for the better as now that you know what can happen next, tensions can rise (when its bad) or you can finally stop being agitated at a run of four fucking red tentacles and -4s.

-The skill checks are the only mechanic in the entire game. Oh I know the rule book(s) are filled to the brim with mechanics but they're all fake. For every new name, number, or color they give a mechanic, it all boils down to drawing a token from the chaos bag (i.e. rolling the chaos die), then comparing your numbers with the target number. It's boring. It's the entire game; all of it. Everything you do boils down to that with absolutely nothing else. Want to investigate? Skill check. Want to attack? Skill check. Evade? Random event? Story event? ALL skill checks. All you do is gamble some skill boosts before the chaos bag (I mean die) then draw (roll) to see if you succeed. That's it. That's the entire game from the moment you sit down to the moment you go home. Everything is just a thinly reflavored version of this exact same mechanic. All your deckbuilding and narrative and whatever other stuff you think you're doing just boils down to skill checks every action.

-The tokens look like dogshit and are totally unnecessary. Fantasy Flight has the uncanny ability to overproduce any game and underproduce it simultaneously. Too few cards to feel like a functional deckbuilder. Too many goddamn tokens to make any sense. I swear this game is 1d6 SAN loss every time you look at it. Most of the tokens (clue/doom/resource) could've just been tracker cards or anything else that isn't insanely fiddly and gets in the way of play. Obviously tokens aren't a big deal but when you think "card game" you don't think "needs twice the space just so tokens don't get everywhere". This is a minor nitpick. As is the statement that they look terrible. The tokens basically resemble the uninspired, lazy design of Edritch Horror, which I'm convinced they stole from D&D Castle Ravenloft et al. board games. Those games have the exact same yawn-syndrome of single color design everywhere. It's nothing to look at. And in a board game, you want something interesting to look at.

Nitpicks aside, this game has serious flaws that hamper it from providing anyone with experience in any of what Arkham Horror LCG is trying to do from enjoying it. If you have played a deckbuilder, this will feel like it comes short. If you've roleplayed, this will make you actually cringe or laugh. If you like design, your eyes will yawn. Hard pass for me and my group. Major regret buying this.

RATING: 5
I'm not entirely sure why, but I just can't get into the way this game plays. Maybe I'm doing something wrong, or maybe I'm just over the FFG model of card gaming. It might even be the Lovecraft mythos being overdone or mishandled in some way. Might give it another go or two, and then decide what I do with it.

Wow. Just.. wow. 

Perhaps not the best adventure game I've ever played, but it takes the cake for the best LCG cooperative adventure experience (I detest Lord of the Rings: LCG, as does Jen -- and she [i]adores[/i] Tolkien).

I'd rate this a 10/10 if it maintains its edge as the card pool grows. Right now it shows a lot of promise, and threatens to make good on that promise at almost every turn, but certain elements have yet to be fully realized. 

For example: It is really cool the players can get XP to spend on card upgrades between quests. However, for any particular class, those upgrades are currently rather paltry, and I was throwing XP away after the second scenario since I was happy with my deck.  

8/10 (for now).

:arrowE: [u]Synopsis[/u]:
Build a deck of cards to represent the abilities, equipment, and flavor of your investigator, then face other decks of horrid effects, discover clues, and advance plot acts against the racing clock of DOOM AGENDAS.

:arrowE: [u]What I like most[/u]:
THIS is the RPG/board game cross-over I've been looking for for a while. The co-op nature of the LCG means I don't have to scramble to own all of it all the time, and the deck-as-investigator's-character-sheet is awesome. RNG is handled through a bag of variable tokens, replacing custom dice with a fascinating blend of risk aversion and buffed card effects against failure. The game manages to evoke a powerful story-telling aspect while giving players lots of crunchy options to play WELL in addition to immersing themselves in rich, potent narrative. I've barely scratched the surface, but I'm smitten.

:arrowE: [u]What I like least[/u]:
Remember that time when you had to discard half of your hand and then got attacked by monsters without any chance to set up your weapons, spells, or abilities? Yeah. Me too.

11/16/17 EDIT: I'm bumping this from 8 to 10 on the basis that it really is such a riveting experience, but also such a STRONG GAME. It really nails the theme and mechanics of an unfolding mystery which manages to evoke great emotion and drama (and hilarity!) while also rewarding thoughtful deck construction and player decision.

RATING: 10
A masterpiece. Very likely to become my favorite card game of all time as it expands. This is what I so desperately wanted the LOTR LCG to be even though I couldn't articulate what it was I was needing. Building a deck feels more like building a character than a collection of cards and the story lines are engrossing, interesting, and have enough internal variability to warrant multiple plays. I suspect I will be playing this one for years and I can't wait.

Not sure about this one.  Very swingy, and sometimes mmind-numbingly repetitive (not unlike the original Arkham Horror!).  During the last couple games, I've caught myself thinking, why aren't I just playing Eldritch Horror (if I want a story-driven game) or LOTR LCG (if I want a short, thinky card game).

Maybe the game has hidden charms yet to be revealed? Rating may go up.

For me, the two most impressive things about the game are how well it works both coop and solo and how satisfying the rpg elements are. I generally hate coop games (ugh I can’t even stand pandemic; so quarterback-y) but AH absolves the sins of the genre in my book.

The storytelling opportunities too are great. In our last game, my unwashed but lovable rogue and his dog went ham and made a scene in a fancy Italian restaurant to attract the attention of the bad guys while my wife’s erudite researcher babe snuck in the back and investigated some freaky business. Then the interdimensional slime really hit the fan.

Wouldn’t mind just a biiiiiitttt more replayability with the core set though. But who am I kidding, just take my money FFG.

Upgraded to a 9.5 with Dunwich Legacy. Extra scenarios and deckbuilding options add a lot.

Viciante al máximo. Para ser un juego de cartas transmite de una manera genial la sensación de ir resolviendo un misterio y explorando nuevas localizaciones.

Los mapas tienen variantes generadas al azar para que no sean siempre lo mismo. Aun así los desafíos no dependen tanto de conocer el mapa o la forma optima de resolver el misterio ya que hay encuentros al azar, cambios en el mapa y la constante de que tu personaje (o baraja) no es siempre la misma. Además, la campaña tiene variantes en función de tus acciones en las misiones anteriores con lo que siempre hay posibilidad de hacer las cosas de otra manera para ver que sucede y/o sacarte finales diferentes.

Y hablo de decisiones en plan "Haces caso al consejo del misterioso personaje y quemas tu casa... o no confías en el y la dejas como está?"

Es un juego al que siempre tengo ganas de jugar. A dos jugadores va genial y andas ahí estrujándote el cerebro todo el rato para ver como os podéis ayudar el uno al otro o como conseguir determinados objetivos de la manera más rápida y eficaz.

I'm a little burned out on the Eldritch Horror family of games, or rather, I just still enjoy the trio of Eldritch, Arkham and Elder Sign so much that the latest two, critically acclaimed entries to the line (this one and Mountains of Madness 2E) haven't hit for me quite as strongly as for others. That said, this is a great design, solo or multiplayer, and if you don't mind the constant upkeep of an LCG line, this will prove a solid adventure in the vein of the LOTR card game or the now defunct Warhammer Quest card game. Expect that some storylines will be redundant to the other Lovecraft games.

The decks are too damn big, so they make no thematic sense in a game that is supposed to be about theme.  Why does Jenny Barnes only sometimes have her signature .45s?  And when I draw the card in mid-scenario, where did they come from?

This game is the first game that totally left me satisfied after I played it.  This one hit the nail on the head with the fact it is

Soloable
Cooperative
Lovecraftian
Choose your own adventure
Has great art
And the deckbuilding / upgrading is fantastic 

I have 6x core sets, all the expansions, all the monsters from Fantasy Flight (great to use during fights to show where monsters are), most of the investigators (same as above):, terrain, and all manner of special tokens.  To say I am obsessed would be an understatement :)

I love most of Lovecraftian games so was very enthusiastic about trying this one out. I have to say it didnt dissapoint. Art is great as usual, the atmosphere is present and the gameplay is simple and easy to follow. Cant wait for the game to come out. My only possible problem is the potential replayability issue and that could lower the value in the future.

My problem with this game is that it claims to be both story driven and highly replayable, a mix that just does not work. If you're like me and prefer to experience a proper story once and be done with it, you'll run out of game real fast. The solo experience is just plain annoying and lackluster. Consider my rating for 2+ players only.

Wow. This game is amazing.
It is a crossbreed among a complex card game and an RPG. The idea is wonderful, and the execution very compelling.
It is obviously a derivative of LOTR LCG (it has the same designers!), but it is almost completely a different game and experience.
There is a trade off between the possibility to build large comboish tableaus (LOTR has it, while AH limits player much more) and the campaign system, with the sense of progression and engagement of this quasi-RPG.
The mechanics are sound and polished, and I confess I love the chaos bag.
Bravo, FFG. Another winner LCG.

RATING: N/A
Pretty fun,but it is way too obvious from the get go that you need to commit more money to have a great, rather than a good experience.  Playing with one core set, your deck building options are severely limited as you can only have one of each card in a deck.  These limited decks are unpredictable and hard to play with, as you don't know which cards you will draw in a game and can't formulate a good strategy to play with the game.  When it came down to it I was not willing to commit the extra $35 that would make this a fun strategic game rather than a heavily randomized story-telling experience.

RATING: 6.5
This game runs the gamut. Some aspects are good, some aspects are middling and other aspects are terrible. Due to that, the comments here will be quite extensive. My rating is a combination of the solo experience and the cooperative experience where both use one core set and the expansion cards are only unlocked in order of use (e.g. when first playing the core set, you cannot use the Dunwich cards). If I ignored my enjoyment of this game as a solo experience, this would likely get a 4 or lower from me.

First, let's discuss what's good. 

The Lovecraftian story is what shines here. The acts, agenda and scenario text create a good story. Additional story elements emerge based on the investigator decks and the encounter decks. The fact that you don't see the entirety of either of those decks contributes to the emergent story.  Also contributing are the various card types, the combinations allowed in the various investigator decks, and the variation of the card effects themselves. Plus, on average, the artwork does a good job of bringing the theme through. The campaign and permanent health/horror effects also contribute to the story telling of this game. This game does well as a solo game where you slowly soak in the story and don't need to worry about making sure everyone is enjoying the game.

The theory of this game providing interesting options for deck construction is a positive, but the game is not there yet, especially if you are without multiple core sets.

Now, for the middling.  

The game play is shallow. The card play and skill checks are two aspects that are done better in other games. Every skill check-generating action feels the same (e.g., investigating feels the same as attacking, etc.) and that makes for a pretty procedural, unexciting experience (ignoring the story). For most cards, you choose whether you use a card for its text effect or its skill check modifier. CDGs do a better job of making this type of decision more compelling, due to the choice in CDGs feeling more strategically flexible and player-driven. Here, the decision to burn a card during a skill check feels less about your cleverness in deciding what will help you progress, and more a simple weighing between the importance of the skill check and card's effect. This is also where drawing only a portion of your deck and its resulting chaos has a negative effect, as the card draw is more chaos than consistent. 

Additionally, as a comparison, the card play in Gloomhaven is leaps and bounds more fun than the card play here (in both the decision of what cards to play and how it injects randomness). Looking to a different game, Nemo's War does a better job of making skill check wagers feel meaningful but not wasteful if the outcome is a failure. Now, all this can be hand-waved away as being "thematic" of the doom-rich Mythos universe, but that seems merely an excuse for the lackluster mechanisms employed in this game. This game attempts to provide both chaos and control, but mixes them poorly. Other games (e.g., Gloomhaven and Nemo's War, among others) do control better. Mansions of Madness, 2nd Edition, does chaos better simply because it embraces the chaos more fully and doesn't obfuscate the chaos with comparatively uninteresting control mechanisms. 

This game is essentially simple, but the rule books add unneeded complexity. Normally, I like FFGs rule book structure, but its out of place or poorly done here. The rule book remains by your side for much longer than it should be. Most of the undue rule book-generated complexity could have been cured through additional player aids and keyword references.  

Finally, due to the structure of the core box, the deck construction aspects of this game are greatly reduced in importance until you get a number of expansions (or get multiple core sets, which I refuse to do, since you double the cost to receive the small portion of the core box you actually need). There is some replayability in this game due to the variation in investigators, ability to construct different decks, and each scenario only using a subset of the possible cards. But the experience of going through a scenario for the first time can never be recaptured and that's the biggest strength of this game.

Finally, for the awful. 

The core set of this game makes the co-op experience about as boring as it could be. Here, you often end up with investigators that are silo-ed to certain actions. The interaction between the players is relegated to table talk and donating cards to skill checks. The Warhammer ACG core set felt more cooperative/interactive than this core set. Honestly, at the current state of the game, having one core set makes this game almost unplayable at 2 players, due to the low level of interactivity and the reduced number of investigator combinations that can be played. The Dunwich and Carcosa expansions improve on the interactivity between players via the introduction of new cards. Unless you have a group that is fully invested in the story telling of this game, I would not recommend the cooperative experience of this game. 

The production choices of this game and some of its expansions are pretty terrible for what you pay. As touched on above, the core set is playable at 1 player but barely playable at 2. You get zero ability to organize the game so that set up time is simplified (no Dominion-style box here). The stand-alone expansions (e.g., Rougarou) are vastly inferior in both card quality and instruction quality. It feels like they've provided the players with the absolute minimum of what's required to play this game. It borders on shameful.

I have the core set, Dunwich Horror and the first two scenarios of the Dunwich campaign at this moment. So far it is excellent and challenging. Compared to another game I enjoy, LotR LCG, there is much less focus on deck building for a scenario and more on starting with a basic deck and enhancing it by gaining XP in scenarios and spending it to upgrade cards. It means that you can get up and running with this very quickly and don't need the encyclopedic mastery of the cards that other LCGs may need.

Fun, thematic and a great LCG so far!  Currently pre-ordering the packs as soon as they appear and have no reason to stop yet!

NB The main downside is the box itself for the game. It's useless for holding the cards past the first set and isn't a normal FFG size, so a card divider won't fit properly in there.

Living Card game with a story. Probably best played with 1 or 2 players.

Rules are difficult at first, but later on well explained with a Reference manual going deeper into the system. Less groundbreaking as the LOTR LCG but it has a bit better solo play. Replayability is not its strong point as much attention was given to follow a close story line. But you always play with other investigators and after X time you forget the exact stories andbor locations that are randomised anyway.

The advantage of these solo LCG's is that you can come back to them long after the "hype" died off and even within 20 years you can play them on your own.

I dropped the initial score somewhat after a break of almost one year and writing a new review on the BGG forum. It is always good to return to a game with a new look after one year. The game is still great.

EH is still the best in this genre as it has wide open boards and strategic planning. Mansions of Madness2 is the best story teller but this AH LCG has better replayability than MoM2.

RATING: 9
Lovecrafts Cthulu Mythos is being placed on many games these days, however, I am a fan of this world and I think it fits perfectly for a cooperative game. 
This game is a cooperative deck builder with relatively simply mechanics and a clear turn structure. The deck building is a big part of this game and it really pays off if you try to give players specific roles. One has to be the muscle that helps you get rid of strong enemies, another one has to be good in finding clues that are necessary to progress in the story. If you play with more than two players (which we do) there is room for more archetypes. 
Although there is a somewhat limited number of card types scenarios typically feel different enough. The investigators also play quite differently, even if they are the same color. The card pool becomes bigger with each scenario which makes deck building and the development of archetype more interesting as time goes by.
What I like about many campaign based games, and this in particular is the fact that decisions will matter later in the campaign even if that means some snowballing. Usually the better you do early, the easier it is later. 
The growing card pool and the adjustable difficulty gives the game also some replay value. 
One of the minor negative aspects is the small number of new cards for each color in the scenario packs. It is likely that you won´t include cards from every expansion in your deck.

If you like cooperative play, the Cthulu mythos and deck building this one is for you.

This looks superb. I love the LOTR card game, but this looks a bit more streamlined so I might get to play it a bit more.

Quick update after 3 plays and a successful completion of the first campaign, It is really good, and certainly is bit easier to play than LoTR, a bit quicker too and so I suspect it will get played more. However,it is fiddly to set up and I find I'm not as desperate to play it as I thought I would be.

Arkham Horror: TCG has really impressed me with the way its mechanics can be adapted to lots of different storylines and scenarios. I've played through the first and second campaigns with a group and enjoyed both immensely, even if I think the actual deckbuilding options were fairly limited until we were pretty deep into the Dunwich expansions. It's definitely not a cheap game to get into, since playing each campaign after the first requires buying a lot of extra content, but its gameplay is tight, tense, and thematic (thematic to FFG's version of the Arkham universe if not Lovecraft's original stories). Not sure if we'll get into campaign three yet, due to the cost involved, but if you've got the cash to spend it's a fantastic game.

What an awesome evolution of the LOTR LCG.  I really like the way deck building works, where each character has specific rules with how they can build their deck.  The weakness cards are also a nice touch, although they always seem to come out at the worst time!  The game overall feels much more thematic than the LOTR LCG, and i think this theme just fits better in general.   There are so many places they can go with this game, and I am super excited to see where it will go.  Totally in for this money pit!

This game has me jonesing for more content.  Each scenario feels unique in both mechanisms and narrative. After the first deluxe expansion, the deck building possibilities are already interesting for most of the investigators. Play scales well for different player counts. 

Not the easiest teach. I think teaching the game during play works best.  A far amount of iconography and terminology to pick up.  There is no shortage of moving parts to keep track of during each phase. You will making rules blunders, but you will learn from them.

The biggest negative is overall cost.  After buying one or more core sets you will pay $15 per month for mythos packs and $30 every 7th month for a new deluxe. Not to mention component upgrades, storage, and sleeving to protect your investment.

RATING: 7
I was excited to try this game as a huge fan of the LotR LCG. I would say that I had mixed impressions overall. There are some significant changes here from LotR LCG, and while some I think work well, others are a disappointment for me. First, I really enjoy the new concept of locations. Investigators move around and attract new monsters and location abilities. This introduces the idea of splitting up or staying together and I think that is quite smart. I also think they have done a nice job is simplifying the way resources work. Instead or individual resources or the four spheres, there is now just a generic resource that can be spent. I also thought the limited campaign style elements they introduced are fun and done well. There isn’t a ton of player progression and growth, but it does a better job of tying the three base set scenarios together than LotR LCG did. Finally, the way that they simplified the doom tracking is simpler and easier to manage overall. 

However, there are also other changes that I didn’t care for much at all. The exciting and puzzly combat system of LotR LCG is now gone. If an active monster in engaged with you, it just hits you for a fixed amount of damage. No blocking to speak of etc. This felt bland and a letdown when comparing to the LotR system. I also didn’t really enjoy the chaos bag (well chaos (please provide your own) bag). While I can really appreciate how this is a very elegant way to tailor the difficulty of a scenario, it also feels very random. I didn’t hate it because of the options for push your luck mitigation, but it just felt more random when compared to the shadow cards in Lotr LCG. I also didn’t really enjoy the fact that you either have to evade or fight a monster engaged with you or you will take damage. It felt like one random monster draw from the deck could dictate your entire turn, and I was missing some sense of choice when this happened (i.e. play a card first, etc.). I also missed the ability to control multiple characters from LotR LCG. The puzzle of how to commit your characters from this game is really excellent and here it is missing. Lastly, as a completely personal preference I much prefer the LotR setting over the Cthulu one.

In the end I think FFG has delivered a solid co-op LCG that will get better with time. They have streamlined some things from LotR, but in doing so they have eliminated some of the best aspects (combat, resource management, control of multiple characters for more choice) in my eyes. The constant skill checks and random modifiers, while fitting perfectly in the Arkham/Eldritch line that FFG has created, just take me a bit out of the game and make things feel more random. I prefer LotR overall as a game and I think it provides more of a challenge and mental workout. However, if you are interested in getting in on the ground floor of a co-op LCG and are intimidated by the large number of expansions out for LotR LCG, then this is a fine place to start I think. Instead of an improved and perfected LotR LCG experience, I think what you have here is a streamlined (for better and worse) version that will appeal to some fans, but probably leave LotR LCG fans feeling a bit underwhelmed.

Probably higher than I've rated it for living card game fans, AH:TCG is an incredibly polished LCG. The theme comes through just as coherently as any of its board-based siblings and the depth of play is there if you commit to the system. But, looking at the core game alone, there's not much diversity in deck building, the balance is poor, and the initial campaign is largely an on-rails experience with little space to try different approaches. Regardless of the game's quality, it's hard to recommend it to someone who isn't willing to invest a significant amount of money (and time!) to continuing with AH.

The usual banging my head against a brick wall while trying to learn one of these modern card games that seem to baffle me so much but...

This one is really drawing me in, in a way that LoTR LCR did not. I'm actually carefully re-reading the reference guide, studying youtube videos (thanks Arkham Chronicles) and trawling the AH card game rules forum for the answers to the stupid questions already asked by others that I can secretly pretend I already knew. I've even bought the dreaded 2nd boxed set mainly due to wanting 4 investigators ready to go and also perhaps in the vague hope that one day I can learn something or other about that weird pastime, deck building.

Most likely I buy the Dunwich Legacy cycle.

Ultimatum of Dread: Do not skip the mythos phase during the first round of each game.
Ultimatum of Chaos: Each player’s starting deck of 30 non-signature, non-weakness cards must be selected at random from among all eligible options in that player’s collection.
Ultimatum of Induction: Investigator decks can only contain level 0 cards. Investigators cannot earn or spend experience.
Ultimatum of Finality: Campaign Mode only. If an investigator is defeated by physical damage, they are killed. If an investigator is defeated by mental damage, they are driven insane.

Resource Generation
Fortunately, that's not too much of a problem for Rogue investigators like Jenny Barnes (The Dunwich Horror, 3), who can gain resources fast with cards like Burglary (Core Set, 45), Hot Streak (Core Set, 57), and Lone Wolf (Blood on the Altar, 188). And once you have all those resources at your disposal, it'll be good to know that Dario El-Amin will be, at least, a little invested in seeing you make your way out of the asylum.

Love this game, it's incredibly fun to play. Even replaying the scenarios stays interesting, even though you'll have a rough idea of the main events. The deck building aspect needs expansions to really feel interesting- the base game only has a few extra cards per character/class, so you really don't have any options for expansion. Excited to get some of the expansions, and would recommend!

As a huge fan of Mansions of Madness 2 I was expecting great card game with deep theme. I was curious how the game can deliver theses things using cards and some tokens... after first play my first thought about this game is "wonderful". Of course it is not perfect thanks to not elegant rules. During first game I had to check many things in the rules supplement because something wasn't clear and wrongfully understood would create irreversible mistake and in short time break the game. Overall very satisfying experience. Can't wait to advance with the story. 

Great solo experience!!!

Great game, really enjoy the narrative and decisions in the game, seems easier with 2. Definitely needs expansions, but that is only to be expected as it is a LCG.

You can see the heritage bit of LotR LCG bit of warhammer quest card game and a bit of Arkham/Eldritch, I love it :)

Currently a 9 with more content I expect it to be a 10.

*** Update, even without the extra content (just have 2 cores) I'm totally hooked, played through the included campaign 3 times now (still yet to have a 'win' result for #3), and I'm not bored yet. Like Mansions of Madness 2nd Ed this seems to stand up to repeated plays, which I had concerns about previously. Now upping rating to a 10.

Fact it plays solo great too is a big bonus.

I've always enjoyed HP Lovecraft and his brand of cosmic horror. I'm a fan of cooperative boardgames.

Because of all of this, I love Arkham Horror: The Card Game.

This has game has me more excited for a tabletop gaming series than anything I've played in quite a while, because the base mechanics are so strong, yet at the same time, so open, that the possibilities for expansions and character customization/deck building seems endless, yet it also strikes a deft balance between complexity and accessibility. 

But, with all that high praise, I can only rate a game for what it is, and not what it promises to be, and that's why I'm giving this an 8 as opposed to a 10, because the core set is fairly limited as it stands, and even though I'm ecstatic to see how Fantasy Flights expands upon this experience in the future with new characters, cards, and campaigns, this core set only comes with one campaign. 

Don't get me wrong, that one campaign is a blast to play, but you can only play through it three or four times before you've already seen everything in the Mythos Encounter deck, and by that point you've also already got the location encounters, the act decks, and the agenda decks memorized, which severely limits replayability.

This game is a great investment, I'd highly recommend it. It's just good to keep in mind that this isn't exactly a finished experience, just yet. Once Fantasy Flights has delivered on the promise of its future expansions, and delivered more campaigns to play through, this might be the closest thing to a perfect cooperative gaming experience I've ever had.

I played the Lord of the Rings LCG for a little while and enjoyed it for a little while.  I like CCG/LCG and customizable games in general and the Lovecraft universe.  The adventures here are cool.  But overal it feels too puzzley and fiddly and I'm not a big solo gamer (although I will play a solo every once in a while) and I don't have someone interested in playing this with me.  I think with an interested partner this could be pretty cool.  But for me, I'd rather play one of the many other FFG solo Lovecraft games.

Pretty good game.  My play group has gotten into cooperative games lately, and I always like Lovecraft.  I also like the ability to play it solo.  I suspect the game won't reach full enjoyment for me until I add another base game or an expansion so that I have enough cards for more than two players to play at once.  Likely my rating will go up once I've played it with more investigators.

RATING: 10
I rate Eldritch Horror quite highly (you can read my review below). This game is everything I like about Eldritch Horror, but better. It's faster-paced, richer in its storytelling, more challenging, and more strategic. It's a truly exceptional game.

To date, there have been 13 officially released scenarios (but there are only three in the base game.) That's an excellent amount of replayability, which is further enhanced by the randomness of card drawing and a wide range of investigators to choose from. Like Eldritch Horror, the unique theme of each investigator really shines forth. Each and every one of them feels greatly different to play and tells a compelling story. You'll want to try them all. 

There's Roland, a strong and smart FBI agent who would like to keep all the occult happenings hushed up; Daisy, a physically limited but fearlessly inquisitive librarian; Skids, an ex-convict who excels at giving monsters the slip; Agnes, a waitress with frightening mystical powers. Lastly there's Wendy, a weak and lonely orphan, but for all that no less resolved to fight evil.

The investigators are quite unbalanced (and the player cards even moreso) but this is not vitally important in a co-op game. 

Another strength is that the game scales very well between 1 and 4 players. Solo play is a fun challenge--it's very fast-paced (a scenario might take 30 minutes or less), and it's kind of fun to imagine one person trying to single-handedly take on the horrors of the cosmos. 2 and 3 work very well, and greatly increase the strategy possibilities. At 4, you start to get a little bit of drag, but it's definitely playable. I'd budget about thirty minutes per person per scenario, plus perhaps ten minutes for setup.

A few mechanics deserve notice as particularly brilliant. The chaos bag is simply more fun than using dice. Even more important, it makes the game's difficulty very easy to scale. Simply swap a few tokens and you've got a dramatically more or less challenging game. The campaign system is very well done. The trauma mechanic is just right; defeat is punished, but not excessively harshly. Spending XP, of course, is quite fun. Right now XP options are a bit limited, but the card pool grows every month. The decision to keep player decks quite small (around 33 cards) is good--it allows for consistency and strategy in deck design with only 2 copies of each card. I love the weakness system. Weaknesses add a bit of tension to every card draw, and really bring out the theme of each investigator. 

One downside is that the core set only includes one copy of most player cards. You'll need to buy a second one, therefore, to do any real deckbuilding. Even then, if you want to run a game with 2-4 players, you might wish you had 4 or even more core sets. 

The campaign in the core set (Night of the Zealot) is pretty short and simple. It's fun, and I saw enough in it to play it through five or six times. I suspect it will not be seen, in the long run, as the best this game has to offer. Its second scenario, Midnight Masks, nonetheless deserves mention as a clear standout.

An intriguingg story married to satisfying gameplay makes this LCG stand out, and is also one of the first "story-driven" games I have truly enjoyed. Definitely going to be getting the expansions and looking forward to my next play. A good chance this goes to an 8.

Second play: yep, it's a solid 8. Bear the first scenario, looking forward to the next.

Edit: more plays. Still enjoying, but shaving rating to a 7.5

Complete money grab, with one Core set you can barely play, and buying a second one for a third of the cards is ridiculous. FFGs business model keeps getting more and more disrespectful... Sold the game one week after buying it.

this game as lcg has not a lot of sense. it would be a better usual game with expansions. the role and campaign aspects are great. the gameplay is good too, but the difficulty level is absurdly high, even in easy mode. the "pay per win" option (get more core sets) is not an option for me, and the easy level is not working for me.

i downgrade it from 7 to 6. i've played all the campaign, and still not working for me. rules that penalize by adding more difficulty to the next scenario because you fail in the precedent one... wtf? if i'm not enough wise to win the first one, then is the better to complicate the 2nd? and again in the 3rd? then, i feel the characters vanished, only the cards play. the powers of the caracters are few and almost unseen (compared with pathfinder heros, where playing with one or another changes absolutely the play style). and if the deck is the soul of the character, then it's a bad sample of it, because your deck is so deep that you only play a few cards of it.

Really wanted to like this but has fallen a bit flat so far.  There are some really neat ideas here.  Linking decisions made in one game to a future game is clever as is allowing you to continue your campaign even if you 'fail' a scenario.  But the endless looking up of keywords and trying to work out how they interact took the shine off.  Will review my rating after trying Dunwitch.

Coin capsules for the chaos tokens - not for protection but for the better tactile feeling

What a blast.

Arkham LCG had a difficult start: I love the Cthulhu Mythos, I like what FFG did with it, I liked the Lord of the Rings LCG before, so this HAS to be good.

How can a game live up to these high expectations?
I really don't know but it did.

Cool stories/storyline: check
Character developement: check - (unlike PACG!!!)

It has an equally easy to handle round structure like LotR LCG but tells a story with it.

Even though we didn't win the base campaign (we did pretty well until the last scenario but then one fled and one became insane) this game pulled us right in.

And the next campaign is going to be around 10 scenarios??? But only 2 of the 6 Mythos packs are available? Are you kidding me?
I can't start with the campaign otherwise I'll have to stop halfway through...so I have to wait.

I know, this isn't too informative but I'm so stoked about this I can't really think about writing a proper comment about it.

See you in Arkham!

Another good co-op LCG. The game is certainly more "streamlined" than Lord of the Rings LCG: the rules are easier to understand and the game "makes sense" even on the first play. However, I can't help but feel it isn't as thematic, or as true to the source material as LotR. 

As the story unfolds, events seem kind of random and arbitrary, and without actual flavor text on individual cards a la Eldritch Horror or Mansions of Madness 2ed, I just don't get as much as a "Lovecraft feel" from this game. Which is OK. I'll follow this for a couple of expansions to see how/if my feelings change, but for now I still prefer LotR.

Arkham Horror LCG offers another way to enjoy the co-op horror game. This game is, in my point view, a real Ameritrash type. The theme is so strong, centralising in the HP Lovecraft's universe. Every fan will be liking this card game. The art is mostly recycled from the other game in the franchise. Although the theme is strong, I would say the mechanic is a bit boring: read and then skill check, investigate then skill check. Everything is decided by the chaos tokens, a creative way to replace dice. I give 7,5 not because I like the mechanic, but because it offers a great story.

Just interviewing people about their experiences with this game, it seems like the key is to buy two copies of the base set so you can get access to two of key cards that they give you only one of. This is crazy; it annoys the hell out of me the way FFG ships core sets that don't really give you what you need to actually enjoy the game. Anyway, I've gotten a few of the expansions so I'm looking forward to giving this another go with a few more cards, but I haven't steeled myself to buying another core set yet.

Finished the scenario arc in the main box. It's an odd game. The mechanics are there - it's a solid set of systems, much more so than the board game or even the Star Wars and Lord of the Rings LCGs. The narrative elements are clever and satisfying. But the balances, as usual, seem weirdly out of whack. You draw through a minimal number of cards from your deck in a game (maybe you see 10 of 35-ish?) which makes it super-chaotic. Sometimes, like in our last game, you draw one of the impossible-to-defeat boss monsters out of the deck on turn 1 and the game becomes basically unwinnable right there. Sometimes you get one of the handful of vital and powerful cards from your deck in the deal, sometimes you don't. You spend 6 or 10 XP getting better cards into your deck and then maybe there is a 50/50 or chance you'll see one of them the next game. The quality of the experience is weirdly dependent on how well/poorly/interestingly you draw, and there just isn't a lot you can do about it and there is a huge amount of variation in the card flow.

I'll be curious to see where they go with this - introducing more cards to the deckbuilding to even out the chaos would obviously be helpful. I might be good for the upcoming deluxe expansion, just to see where it goes, but I doubt it's something I'll get sucked in to. We'll see.
---
Other than Netrunner,  haven't liked any of FFG's [C|L]CGs very much - they're mostly pretty procedural and mechanical and don't really engage with their theme much; both Star Wars and Lord of the Rings are pretty abstract with a bit of fan service. But this was OK. The game design is reasonably streamlined, it has real nods to Lovecraftian stories (albeit very pulpy ones), and the way the three scenarios are tied together is clever. Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, and the previous incarnations of Cthulhu LCG all felt very mechanical and derivative to me; this one actually felt like someone designed it with the goal of making it at least somewhat Lovecraftian.

As a game, the resource management and tactical choices you make are still not super-compelling, and the biggest problem is probably just that you don't cycle enough cards. With 35-ish cards in your deck and cycling only maybe as few as 10 to at most 20 a game, it's a bit of a crapshoot whether you get what you need in a timely manner. Some of the Weakness cards are really brutal (the cop's Coverup in particular is almost game-breaking) and the strategy with these seems to be to just not draw them, and certainly not to draw them early. Seriously, don't play the cop. Starting with two mental traumas going into scenario 3 is a back breaker.

Anyway, I enjoyed this, it's not the total package, but to me it's way more fun than Arkham Horror or Elder Sign and it's a nice 2p. But it's expensive for what it is; $40 MSRP for a 4 hour campaign for two players is very, very pricey by boardgame standards. You're buying into the whole LCG if you're buying this; it's the only way you'll eventually get value. We'll see how it unfolds, if it pulls me back more than I expect. I might revisit it in 6 months when the environment is more mature.

Based on 1 play with 4 players (first scenario):

Hooray! A Lovecraftian game I don't actively despise! This is a weird one to comment on after just one scenario, since you're likely using prebuilt decks (we did). Like its boarded counterparts, there isn't a lot of strategy in the game itself. But that's what makes it feel ripe for the conversion to a deck-based game. The game is random as hell, but giving you the ability to modify the random element by building your deck seems like a great addition to the formula.

Lots of quality of life improvements since the original FFG version of Arkham Horror also speed the game up considerably. Our first scenario took about 2.5 hours and that was with a group who hadn't even looked over their decks beforehand.

I don't think I'll ever consider this a great game, but it's a fun enough thing to do with a group. Much better than TIME Stories.

I really like character optimization in RPGs and the potential to play around with deck construction in this appeals to me.

This was a pretty neat game.  It doesn't appear to be as customizable to start with as LotR but it's only got the core and the beginnings of the game out.

RATING: 4.5
Really wanted to like this one. I saw promise initially and can still somewhat see how this appeals to many. But after playing the core set scenarios it doesn't work for me. The interesting decisions are not there for me, either in-game or with deck building. The gameplay feels too mechanistic and narrative does not emerge. I like the idea of getting into an LCG and this is the first that really appealed to me...but no. Sold to someone who can enjoy it.

RATING: 6
Played through the base campaign on standard (so 3 plays so far). Enjoyed the experience over-all but disappointed vs the glowing praise given by Shut Up & Sit Down. Pain in the butt to set up, especially considering there are only 2 of us playing. You do a little bit of deck-building but may only see 1/3 of your deck during a given game, which can be disappointing. 

Even after playing through the campaign, there are enough rules and exceptions that we were still constantly looking stuff up and made mistakes (For example, a card that says Test Skill vs 3, for each point you fail by take damage; we thought if you drew a -5 and failed by 5 you would take 5 damage, but actually there is another rule somewhere that you can only go to 0 so would take only 3 damage). This can slow down play a lot until you are confident about things, and mistakes can wildly swing the difficulty of a given scenario.

Each scenario took us about 2 to 2.5 hours to play through. For a two player cooperative game this is almost excruciatingly long, though like I said, we spent quite a bit of time rule checking. Essentially every turn we were consulting the rule book or googling forums.

I liked it more than my partner. If we had a full grasp on the game I can see how the replay value comes from trying different strategies and character archetypes. But even so because each game took us so long it's not jumping on to the table after work like some of our other two player games.

A friend purchased this for me knowing how much I enjoyed the previous living card game version of Call of Cthulhu. AH:TCG is trying too hard to be Arkham Horror. I do like the story driven element which they have taken from their Lord of the Rings card game, but I think LotR does it better. 

I would probably play this now and again, but I doubt I'll buy any of the add on packs. Much preferred the original CoC living card game.

Played at Arkham Nights and I must say they improved on the near perfect Lord of the Rings design.  The game, art, scenarios are all fantastic!  The chaos bag is amazing at keeping the tension high and changes its effect each adventure.  The weaknesses in your desk makes you afraid to draw cards and prevents spamming card draw effects.  They also wedged in fully flushed out spatial map system that feels like your almost playing a miniatures game.  It's pretty much perfect.

This game asks a lot of you:
-You need to like the Cthulhu Mythos. 
-You need to want to play a weighty, complex card game.
-You need to deal with an expensive lcg experience. 
-You need to be able to face up to an occasionally punishing co-op experience. 

If you're able to deal with that, you'll be rewarded with a a game that is rich in both immersion and strategy. Of all the a
Arkham Horror files games, I feel that this does the best job of capturing the spirit of the underlying works by lovecraft and Chambers.

It's a good, solid game. The chaos bag is much better than the dice in all other games of the same universe.

The best course of action always seemed obvious.

Own 2x base sets and Countless Terrors playmat
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
(Own 2 copies of the base game, plus several of the pre-painted minis to sub in for the cardboard investigator chits: IMO this means I have enough cards to provide decks for 2 players, 1 Core and .5 expansions containing player cards per player seems necessary so far; I also have 1 copy of every expansion currently released and will be keeping up with this until further notice via subscription).

Overall I find that this is an interesting take on Arkham that in many ways is an improvement on the board game for me, but with some caveats.

First, the plus is that this game much more effectively communicates a story to me than the board game does. Obviously with story driven campaign cards and flavour throughout the campaign this was a given, but it really emphasized to me for the first time how much more abstractly thematic (for lack of a better concept, it's weird but it conveys meaning) AH is in comparison to this. The player decks and campaign ooze theme, which I really like. Second, the customizing, though limited without additional purchases, does give players a lot more leeway to build their team to fit their own preferences, this is pretty appealing as well.

At first blush I'm not sold on the way monsters move in this game relative to the board game, but I think expansions will likely fix this. The complexity of monster movement is one of the annoyances of the base game, but it is also one of the ways that it ratchets up the tension, there isn't as much of that here as monsters tend to hang out where they spawn and there isn't a huge inherent penalty for allowing them to build up as there is in AH.

The major downside I can see for some (not for me personally) is that replay seems modest. I play games like this to experience the story, after you've done that the charm is greatly reduced. That makes the core set box a pretty short value, as it takes 1.5ish hrs. per story, for a total of 5 hours max for each run through the campaign. I have no problem paying the price for ongoing changes, but this one isn't going to be cheap to keep up with. The base set mini-campaign at least does seem to have a severe difficulty ramp for part 3, which I assume is intended to make people play it at least a couple of times to experience different twists, but I doubt I would be interested in going through any story arc very often as the scenarios included here, while good for tutorial purposes, are really not super strong for repeat play for me. Different investigators / pairings do help a bit, but that is only really facilitated fully by having 2 Cores or a lot of expansion material. 

It is possible to get some replay by cranking up the difficulty, but for me, personally, there is no way I could see myself playing any higher than Standard without more powerful options from the expansions as the game can already give you some nasty swings on Easy or Standard. Having additional cards to mitigate the randomness of your own deck (by adding doubles of good 0 level cards, by removing less useful stuff) does a lot to make the higher difficulties manageable, but even with a crazy deck the big negative chits would make the game very random / dependent on great chit drawing and all the higher difficulties really do is greatly increase the chances of being screwed by drawing a huge negative modifier.

Playing off the above one niggle: there really aren't any options for deckbuilding with only 1 box. I personally don't care to optimize things to within an inch of their life, but it would have been nice to have at least a few extra cards for each class sprinkled in so that there are a few options at the start of the game. As it is, I bought a second copy because it is required to allow any combination of characters, and I didn't want to limit our options to only a couple of different combinations. That had the side effect of giving us some ability to tailor the decks. Make no mistake though, this is not a deck-building game per se, as you basically put together a starting deck and then just tweak it lightly throughout the campaign. A second base set is very nice though, as it gives you the ability to specify roles a lot more and to eliminate cards that are not as strong for given characters. The overall approach to deckbuilding in this one is appealing to me, as I wanted something where I could help my gf build a base deck and then let her tweak it; and contrasts with games like LotR where you can rebuild your deck each game. Great for CCG/LCG heads, but not so much for normal, more casual gamers. In the post-Dunwich era you can probably get away with only 1 Core if you want to buy a series of expansions, I still like having duplicates of the Core stuff as there are many staple cards that it would be annoying not to have duplicates of during the deckbuilding phase.

Basically though, I like a lot of what is being done here. The chaos bag is a nice take on randomness and with some tweaks to the types of monster movement and the like I think this will morph into a long term winner. Shame the first box was so short on content though, I already want more!

It is also worth noting that this is a big money sink. To get any sort of satisfaction with 2 players I felt obligated to buy 2 Cores, and to make sure that we are not playing with too much overlap from there on out. I would not even think of playing with 3-4 players unless one of the those players had an additional collection of Cores + expansions to make their (and their partner, if 4) deck with as otherwise you really aren't able to make the decks as effective. This is not a big problem for me, as I only play this with my gf, but if you want to supply a group of 4 and want to really experience the deck building you need to sink some serious coin into this game. Honestly, if you want to play with more than 2 people, then let them try it out with some intro decks using your Core set(s) and then force them to get their own stuff. Supplying an entire group a real free-form pool of cards is not the intent of these types of games and would be a huge money sink and is not something that someone should do unless they (A) have a huge amount of extra gaming money to waste and (B) have friends who are dirt poor and can't cover the cost of their own stuff.

Aside: the game seems perfectly manageable with 2 investigators / players. I think it could end up being pretty hairy with only 1, even on an easier difficulty as there are so many ways to end up in auto-damage situations or to need the use of skills that are not available to your character.

Final note: the trickle of releases doesn't bother me from a budgetary standpoint, but it has slowed our play of this game down a bit. I really am starting to be of the mind that it is best to just have a complete cycle and then play it through at that point. This is mainly because it's a bit of a chore to keep track of decklists, or more basically, what the heck is going on in the story when you have to wait for time periods between plays. I play this game for theme, and it breaks the mood to have big gaps between plays. I started Dunwich, but then put it on pause for about 6 months as I didn't want to just play 1 adventure per month. Unless you are into very sporadic play for this, it seems like the best way to go.

I like the game, but not nearly enough to buy into future expansions or campaigns sets. The narrative elements, while somewhat innovative and interesting, are lost on repeated plays.

This game is a good mixture of a decent card game and the notorious  Arkham stuffs like death from nowhere and clutch dice rolling (this time it is token pulling from a bag).
The only game so far what I played and didn't hate this was Elder Sign because it was way faster than anything similar.
However gameplay wise this is the best Arkham game till now. This time I really feel like I have impact on the game other than move once take an action -which most of the time involves dice- then face my "bad things are coming" card. This has this too but I did enjoy it very much.
On the other hand I barely think I'd play a scenario again just to try a different character or a different deck/difficulty level. Which means this game is really expensive (1box/player) and not so replayable (for me).
I do recommend to try out

Played with my husband because this was on his wishlist. As a newer gamer, I felt some of the concepts weren’t explained very well and I had no idea where to even start with this game. Setup was a bear and by the time we got into the game, my husband had lost interest and I had to teach him what I didn’t really get myself. Frustrating to say the least- plus I don’t like the theme...so I won’t return to this one.

Villámbeszámoló:
Viszonylag egyszerű játék, de nagyon komplex a sok kis apróság miatt amire folyamatosan figyelni kell - nem a nyugis játékok közé fog tartozni ilyen szempontból sem. Megtanulni nem volt nehéz, de nagyon sok módosító, változó fog jelentkezni, és mindenre figyelni kell. Az első, tanuló játék egyébként kb. 2 óra volt, el is buktuk a küldit. A második kb. 40 perc alatt lement, igaz, az előkészületekkel itt már nem kellett pepecselni.
Rendkívül hangulatos dologról van szó, ami részben a MoM, részben a Gyűrűk ura LCG utánérzetet adja, de azt remekül.

Két fontos tudnivaló:
1) A kampánymód remek, de rövid. Két délután alatt végigjátszható és máris kívánja az ember az új kieget...
2) ...hacsak nem fut neki újra, módosított paklival, és próbál meg még jobb eredményt elérni. Ekkor viszont már nincs, vagy minimalizálódik a meglepetés ereje, így kicsit átmegy amolyan Hanabi féle - ki tud jobb kombóval győzedelmeskedni dologba. Nem baj ez, de a kezdeti meglepetésfaktor csökkenésével nehogy a játék élvezeti értéke is romoljon.

Meglepetésként ért:
A játék egyenesen utasít rá, hogy csak hangulati elemekkel kommunikáljunk. És ettől tényleg szuperebb lesz a játék, jár a keksz. De egy idő után (pláne amikor a maximális kombóval való győzelem a cél) ez ígyis-úgyis átmegy abba, hogy csak a kártyák nevét vagy a tesztmódosító számát mondjuk be.

Nagy pluszpont jár a húzózsákos dologért: nincs kocka, van más randomizáció.

A grafika 10/10, a hangulat 10/10. Az előkészület, a várhatóan számtalan kieget hozó pénzszívás miatt csak LCG kedvelőknek ajánlom, de nekik nagyon. Na jó, picit azoknak is, akik élnek-halnak az FFG-s lovecrafti világért. :)

Amire még kíváncsi vagyok: milyen 1, 3 és 4 fővel.

Why I got rid of it:  

The game was fun but it was a beast to set up.  It had so many special key words and rules, like most games from fantasy flight.  Each pack of cards required 20 min of trying to learn the special stuff for that deck.  It was hard to organize the cards and keep track of all of them.  

Finally, the game was too hard.  It had a fun mechanism to get experience and build up your character but we rarely lived that long and could not get attached to our characters as they kept dying.

I would gladly play someone elses copy.  Then they have to buy it, organize it and listen to the whines of me and other players dying and not keeping the upgrade we worked so hard to get.

Se necesitan 2 cajas básicas sí o sí!

La pena es que necesita una inversión de dinero muy fuerte para empezar a considerarse un juego completo (tener una campaña entera, vamos), pero... creo que ese dineral vale la pena. Pese a su salvaje azar por parte de la bolsa del caos, me encanta este juego.

Fantastic! Best RPG experience in a board game. Your deck is your character, and the fact that you can't massively rework it each scenario (a la Lord of the Rings) means you get to know it really well, flaws and all. You gain experience which can be spent to tweak it and buy better cards, but the small amount you get each adventure means the deck changes gradually. And you can be forced to add bad cards to it due to scenarios. Brilliant. 

The bag drawing mechanism is also very clever. Unlike dice, the odds can be changed each scenario by adding new chits, which can very depending upon the results of a game. But what makes the game is the fact that you play a scenario and, win or lose, advance to the next one. That makes each game feel as if it has consequences...cards can be added or not to your decks and chits to the bag depending upon your actions, and choices can come back to haunt or help you later in the campaign. 

The biggest criticism is the cost of each adventure. You really need to play each one multiple times to make it worth it, but once you  know the secrets you are less likely to want to do so,  FFG has tried to make sure the replays will be different by including variations of some cards that you randomize when you play, so the game may go differently next time. Good idea. 

I hope the quality of the Dunwich Legacy campaign is indicative of those in the future. Right now this is easily the best of the Lovecraft games on the market.

After playing through the base set campaign, I LOVE what's going on here with flexible mechanics for story telling and character development. The best "RPG in a card game" I've found to date. The "chaos bag" format for checks really does add suspense to the game more than most mechanics can. It can be a punishing game so go in prepared to lose. In the end the theme isn't for me thus not sure I'll continue. HOWEVER, I hope FF continues down this game design path and applies it to theme's I'd be more interested in.

Pros:
Fun chit bag pulling system instead of the usual dice roll to pass checks. Adjustable difficulty levels. Hand management and deck building options grow with more expansions. Story content is cool.

Cons:
Campaign system is well done but long and requires dedicated group. Game requires multiple decks for up to 4 players which increases cost.

4 player experience feels like each player has to specialize their deck to be successful which limits how many viable choices for actions there are. For a cooperative game, I think I look more for an adventure than an optimization exercise. Maybe with fewer and/or different player styles, the other story driven mechanics would take over more. The token bag mechanic is awesome.

This game is both the best solo and two player game I have ever played. Thematically perfect. As a Lovecraft fan, most Cthulhu games disappoint me, but this one delivers a punch. The deckbuilding is easy to get into and feel very gratifying. Wonderful artwork and very solid writing. My wallet hates this game.

I played only briefly the first adventure, and had been waiting to assign a rating to this until I have more playtime.  I expect the rating to go up.  It feels like a treat to play.  Several clever mechanics.  My only initial concern is replayability, but it's too early to say really.  And I won't buy expansions on principle.  So there's that.

The Arkham Horror, and LCG, I was looking for.

The theme is amazingly strong and the act\agenda deck allow for some very clever and dramatic ideas, game-wise and story-wise.

The game itself is a superb co-op, it is punishing but not unreasonable. Every round you have to solve a complex and interesting puzzle made out of your enemies, short-term and long term goals and your game state. 

Sure the chaos bag can be cruel, but you an anticipate it. 
Every action matters (especially on the hard modes).
An amazing game, can't wait and see what more is waiting for us in the next expansions.

A cross between the LotR LCG and Warhammer Quest - better than the latter but not as good as the former although I do prefer the less abstract location system in Arkham over it's LotR counter-part.

The stories develop nicely as the game progresses and the character progression is also quite nice. The deck building aspect is not so prominent here which some will prefer but it's an aspect that I really like in LotR so that is where that game really scores.

Probably my favorite cooperative game. This took a system that I found adequate in the Lord of the Rings card game, and tweaked it in all the best ways. My favorite part about the game is that the clever basic structure with the act and agenda decks means that they're only limited by their own ambition and imagination when it comes to designing scenarios and campaigns. 

Incredibly flexible and understandable systems, capable of telling interesting stories, being complex mechanical puzzles, or both, seemingly effortlessly. 

Outstanding. (though the base game scenarios are more proof of concepts than something you'll spend a lot of time with.)

RATING: 3
Bought this very excited a couple of months ago, after having a really positive experience with another FFG game, Eldritch Horror, which my two sons and I greatly enjoy. Have been an unironic Cthulhu mythos fan and player of the Chaosium pen and paper RPG since the 80's. Plus bought hard into all the positive hype about AH: TCG. So I was primed and really, really wanted to like it. Which makes my disappointment all the more crushing. 

The beautiful and varied cards, the well-written scenarios and flavor text, the typically FFG high quality chits and counters -- none of this changes the fact that the gameplay is super clunky, not smooth, forcing pauses every couple of minutes for in-depth rule searches through three different books (Quick Start Guide, Scenario Guide, Reference Guide) with lots of confusing duplicate information, and mostly gets in the way of enjoying the story and situations. I have tried to play this twice already, and the enjoyment fuse has never been lit. I never get to the point where the mechanics recede into the background and I just have a good time. 

Also, personal peeve, I just don't like the token mechanic to modify skill checks. What's wrong with tried-and-true dice, which Eldritch Horror does really well, leading to tense moments of suspense (and hopefully triumph) when the dice go your way? And if you're going to make me use tokens instead of dice, FFG, then at least include a nice thematic bag to enhance the experience. 

My Bottom Line: An ambitious effort to replicate a story-driven RPG, using cards instead of a Game Master and character sheets, spoiled by overly clunky game mechanics and poorly designed rule books. I'm giving this to my older son, perhaps he will have a better time making it work than I have.

Like most recent FFG designs this is a collection of tried and tested systems that work well. The result is a good game if uninspired. The card art, particularly the card backs are exceptional and almost worth the price of admission alone. The Warhammer Quest card game structure + deck building works well for telling Call of Cthulhu stories with numbers on cards. If this game has a long run there could be plenty of coop millage here.

After playing 3 times with core game scenario,
failed each single time to resolve scenario that we want (i play it with my partner). It is horror game (what do you expect eh?)

It is fun game for 2 player, even though the limited character combination with core game, it's co-op shining through. ALWAYS STAY TOGETHER and FIND THAT CLUE DAMN IT!.

The mechanic for each character are unique, seriously unique man!. It's well develop by FFG. I raise my cup of tea for the designer. Well done. They develop it with class character (sound RPG right?), each class have stats (yeah it's RPG pre-made character) like Willpower, Lore, Attack and Agility. The stats are used for test skill from encounter card. 

This game was claim by the designer are story driven and RPG-esque. Well they are right. The story advance by resource called dooms and clues token. The doom token always fuelled the Agenda Card, and the investigator (player) must race with doom token to collect clues for advancing the Act Card. 

Sound easy right, NO! THIS IS HORROR GAME!. The designer make state of Analysis Paralysis
for player in good balance between doing 2 action from 9 option of action (AP already), and you still dealing with monsters, encounters, and your own cards to make finding clues less important (that's just wrong, FIND THAT CLUES DAMN IT!). well it's fun when you ignoring the monsters and just digging your cards for preferable asset card and suddenly everything gone wrong in next phase. TOLD YOU SO! FIND THAT CLUES!

It is fun game that came from horror game. Never expect that horror game can be this hard and fun to play.

The design are well develop, great illustration, nice design for each decks card, the Art-Nouveau style was gorgeously implemented in this game with time era of Lovecraftian. 

The downside of this game are the cycle pack. when you buy the expansion, you got the new character, new deck of cards, and new story to begin, BUT the big box expansion does not contain big portion of the plot story. You must buy the rest of cycle if you begin the expansion with almost 6-7 cycle pack, just to end a story. Story that maybe you enjoy for hours to play with.

But even with core game you still get various story, from player who home-brew their own cycle. This generous people are the best. There's almost 12-13 story that ready to Print and Play.

Arkham Horror LCG seems to be all of the rage. I told myself I would never get into another LCG, but decided to give this one a shot anyway. I decided to do this because:

a) It's very story driven your first few times through a particular scenario/campaign.

b) You can still enjoy it as a coop when you know the story, by trying various kinds of decks.

c) You only needed two Core Sets to have a play set of cards versus the usual three.*

d) Most scenarios are linked in a campaign where you will upgrade your character between scenarios and gain new weaknesses from the horrors you could potentially encounter.

After having played it, I'm disappointed. First, I don't like that cards you spend your experience on to upgrade your character are more powerful versions of cards you already have. I was hoping you could add new and unique cards. This could be detrimental if you build a bad deck. If you were swapping in completely new cards, you could be changing the focus of your deck after seeing what did/didn't work. I realize you could just replay the scenario and make a new deck, but it's just not what I wanted. It's my own fault for not looking into it before buying in, but I was disappointed that despite having a play set of cards with 2 Core Sets, you could potentially want more to have additional copies of neutral cards, if your collection is to be used for more than one person. That may be nitpicky, but that's what LCG's do to me.

I could never be very objective with any LCG. I say this because I really dislike having to spend time outside of gaming to make decks. This doesn't change that. I'm sure it's a good game and probably better than LotR LCG, but it's definitely not for me. Pray that I don't make the mistake of trying anymore LCG's.

This is very Netrunner in how it plays, which is a wonderful thing. Similarly, it's another game where the theme drips off of it with every move, albeit it a different theme. 
It also complements Eldritch Horror well, both thematically similar (tho AH:TCG is much more subtle so far) but neither feels like it's in the others space.

A great card game for Cthulhu fans, with an almost-roleplaying feel. Can be played straight-up, or with a bit of roleplaying spice thrown in. This is a starter set only, and it feels like many more cards are needed for deck building, especially if you're going to be supplying cards for other players as well. That's pretty much standard for an LCG product, but this starter feels like it's on the lower end in terms of replayability of the base box. Still, this is a great game!

Been a fan of H.P. Lovecraft and his Mythos world since first encountering his books way back in my teenage years.

Aaron owns this. We played a 4-player game and this does very well to provide a streamlined version of the board game, playing faster while retaining the oppressive feel of the board game. The horror genre has to make you feel like you are going to lose. Would play again.

As a preliminary comment, I like what they’ve done here to my LOTR LCG though I’m not yet certain if I love it. I need more expansions and time to tell. 
…
I’m rewriting this comment from the future past after having played Dunwich, Rougarou, and Carnevale and now looking back on the core game with some perspective to say I … love … this game. It achieves what it sets out to do by being a complex card game with a quasi-RPG aspect. It hits on both levels for me.

I can’t talk about the game without comparing it to its sister game, LOTR LCG. There’s a tradeoff to be accepted here between the campaign of AH and the bigger play space of LOTR. That is, AH offers the ability to keep your deck between adventures and play scenarios linked as part of a larger story (which LOTR largely does not offer). Conversely, LOTR offers me the ability to build a much larger tableau due to AH’s limitation on slots. 

This prior experience colored my view of AH LCG in that AH LCG felt smaller. At first, I missed being able to build an equivalent dwarf or eagle deck and have this huge tableau of cards whose effects I trigger during my turn. In AH, you’re limited to how many allies (one!) and items you can have in play at a time (a few). That means a lot of your decisions are about which cards to replace, not add to your tableau. I didn’t like this at first and felt unsure of the game. Now, I can see the bigger picture. 

I’m glad that this is not simply a reskinned LOTR LCG but one that has its own construct. The card play is just as sophisticated and interesting as that one albeit in a different way. With a few expansion packs now, the character card choices have opened up in a way not present with just the core game. Consider that if you’re thinking about this game. The token bag works very well for me as the randomness element. Decisions you make during the campaign will add tokens to that bag which you can’t do with dice. The locations have effects or actions (ex, heal 2) that act as ersatz allies and provide another dimension not present in LOTR LCG.

Now that I have a campaign to play, I appreciate trying to make a deck that works from adventure to adventure with a few tweaks in between. Some tweaks are to add more powerful cards and some are to swap in/out equivalent cards to better focus my deck for this particular adventure. But through it all, I become attached to my characters (I like to solo with two) and get immersed in the story.

Because there is a story here. While LOTR LCG renders theme with riding down the Anduin or crawling through Khazad-dum, AH renders a true story where decisions affect the course. My investigators have choices to make that have consequences and persistent effects. The O’Bannon Gang has a bone to pick with us and one of my dudes is cursed, for example. The flavor text of the scenario book as well as the cards do a great job conveying the story that’s unfolding. 

All in all, it’s a great intersection of an RPG and a complex card game. I’m particularly enamored with the Lovecraftian genre (even though it’s filtered through FFG, but that’s another story), so it gets extra points from me in that regard.

RATING: 5
As is usual in the case of a brand new LCG there is very little customisation/deckbuilding initially, as there are simply too few cards to pick and mix the ones you want..... still we shuffled a couple of colours together and gave it a first play through.......

and it was alright, I suppose... 

Its very story driven, the flavour text on the cards matters...however this, first play especially, felt very clunky and stop start- this could be due to the newness, but honestly I was pretty bored with the rather generic story... which turned out to be big boss trapped you ...kill big boss .... and there are only the three scenarios in the box.

The map mechanic is very clever however honestly our table still was not big enough, after all the assets you put into play around your character and the map and the monsters and the token pile and the doom track and the event draw pile and the associated ....and ....and.... 

The token mechanic whereby there are hidden modifiers to your skill checks drawn randomly is interesting however it felt very much like my deck was struggling to even reach an even keel with the challenges let alone beat the skill level by enough that the token pull didn't cripple the character. interesting but not particularly well done.....again this will lessen the more you customised the deck which is simple a case of waiting for more cards to be printed.... 

hmmm not sure about this one at all :shake:

presently my favorite coop game. it doesnt feel like  standard coop gameplay to me. the story is somewhat intriguing but the scenario's different feel is pretty diverse, each level is quite different. we definitely did not kill the final boss, we did the lita thing. cant wait to replay through the game with different characters. after that is Rougarou

Buena historia, buenas mecánicas, fácil de entender, partidas no demasiado largas, campaña amplia (si la compras)... La parte mala es la rejugabilidad, que al ser un juego tan basado en la narración queda un poco hipotecada. En mi colección ya forma parte de una trilogía Lovekraftiana con Las Mansiones de la Locura y Eldritch Horror siendo una especie de hermano pequeño de esos. Un rol guiado por cartas ligero pero bien planteado

I just can't find the fun in this, but I think its a matter of personal taste. I can see that there is a well-done game in there, maybe not for me.

Update: At first I thought it was just me not getting it, now I think it is actually not that good a game. I love Lovecraft themes, but the stories in this are pathetic, the chit-bag mechanic is annoying and your options are quite linear.

A great addition to the FFG Cthulhu games. The  theme comes through really well in this game. The text on the cards is great and really draws you into the game and sets the atmosphere of the game.

It still has the randomness of the big games with the doom bag but it gives you more options to customize your character and more control over them. The cards all integrate beautifully  and the whole engine runs very smooth. Great game!

Initial thoughts: great game, really tense and makes you feel in danger all the time, a lot of luck, great art, decisions have some significance, more interested in the story than in card drafting, wonder about replay value given the short campaign included, for me fairly comparable with T.I.M.E stories but with a much more solid value proposition, much more story-driven than Lord of the Rings LCG.

Edited 05/18/2017: The game feels very limited without expansions, so, until I get The Dunwich Legacy cycle, it goes down from 9 to 8.5.
---

Rating after 8 plays (just the 1st scenario). I'm totally loving this game. I think that after trying the Dunwich Legacy cycle, this could easily become a 10 or at least a 9 for me.

I feel the deck building aspect very streamlined and from a narrative point of view it makes perfect sense to me (each character and the cards she/he can use create a great synergy). 

I enjoy the way the AI is structured and how the story flows smoothly and "reads" by itself. Personally, I'm very fan of H. P. Lovecraft works, so this kind of "choose-your-destiny" game provides a very special flavor to my taste. 

Tons of love and respect for this! Well, except for FFG's merchandise model: why the heck couldn't they (economic interests of course) include 2 copies of each faction player card and charge us 5 extra bucks? This is beyond my capacity of understanding/tolerance. 

Anyway, I'm crazy for this game, so all I can tell you is: if you have addiction tendencies, put yourself away of this game!

Fantastic cooperative card game. The narrative elements and thematic are right up my eldritch alley and the gameplay, while somewhat difficult to understand the first time, is quite enjoyable. Ever-changing decks and a deep card pool lead to unique experiences that'll keep you coming back for another run. I recommend this game highly to any coop gamer.

Pro tip: If playing the same campaign gets stale for you, simply add a new player! Or act as a sort of DM for a full group of 2-4 new players.

Enjoyable with impressive components, but the gameplay is a little thin and there's not enough replay value for the price point.  Plus, endless expansions.  All with very limited gameplay & value, at about triple what should be the price.  I really want to like this, and the production value is impressive, there's just not enough game here.  I may keep the rating high, but I don't think I'll be buying much of the expansions, which is disappointing since this game is so in my wheelhouse.

LCG - should stand for LIMITED card game because that's what it says about the replay-ability in the absence of any expansions.

I mean, contrast this with Race for the Galaxy that gets a lot of flak for being difficult to learn. This is much harder to learn and when you've finally got the hang of it you've already played through the short three scenario campaign. You can try playing through it again to see if you can do any better, maybe try another character ,but you already know the story. No two games of RFtG are alike; there's so much more replay-ability even with only the base game.

Admittedly, this is really the antithesis of the sort of game I like; thematic and story driven but with complex, fiddly rules and incredibly dull mechanics. Don't even bother with this unless you plan to buy into the franchise and get lots of additional content to keep it fresh.

Es un gran juego. Me gusta y lo recomendaría pero aún le queda mucho margen de mejora. La caja base no permite hacer hacer gran cosa en la construcción de los mazos, sobre todo al ganar experiencia. Se ve muy limitada. El setup de la partida se me hace muy tedioso, quizás porque todos los textos a leer y con los que preparar la partida se hallan muy dispersos y porque la relación de setup - tiempo de partida está muy descompensada. En otros juegos como El Señor de los Anillos el setup es muy rápido en comparación. La mecánica en sí es como la de un librojuego (como los del Lobo Solitario, La Búsqueda del Grial, Lucha-Ficción, etc) en su máxima expresión.

I heard this was better Arkham Horror.  It's not better - it's the same Arkham Horror.  The setup is surprisingly time consuming for a card game and the difficulty is punishing.

LOTR lcg 2.0 - Clever co-op deckbuilder with solid progression.  Played through the base scenarios and had a lot of fun.  Seems like it would be expensive to keep up with, just like LOTR, and it's not clear how long characters can go with some punitive progression.

This game is great!  I can't say enough good things.  you will want to replay missions multiple times.

You do have to enjoy building the decks to get the most out of it and in order to get the most out of building decks you will need to invest in two core sets and all the expansions.  Which, I want to be clear here, I have no problem with the game having expansions, but essentially forcing players to buy two core sets simply to get 20 (necessary) cards is really pretty lame of FFGs part.  No reason they couldn't... do a simple conversion kit.

I am not usually looking for this much of a time/money investment from a game.  Fortunately, my friend already made the investment and I just get to play.  EDIT: I just made a trade for this game from said friend.  Now I own it!  Very excited.

And it exceeded my expectations.

This is not an RPG in a box.  It's most definitely a living card game where a lot of fun is in making a good deck regardless of any ideas you might have about your character.  Having said that, the scenarios are very thematic and evocative, but you are not roleplaying (although you will get invested in your character).

In a weird way, it's sort of a better Elder Sign where the Yahtzee-style dice system is replaced with an LCG.

It's also what the Pathfinder ACG wanted to be, but so much tighter and more thematic.

Honestly, if you like 2 out of 3 on Cthulhu, cooperative games, and LCGs, check it out!  But if you can afford to get (all of) it, I don't blame you.

For all of my thoughts see my video review!

Really digging this so far, even with only the base set. The story is fantastic whenever someone first plays it, but the gameplay holds up and is a lot of fun even once you've seen all the scenarios have to offer.
There is great variety in the investigators and classes. Playing through a scenario with a fighter feels totally different than playing with an evading rogue.

Excellent - probably the best of the Living Card Games from FFG who have learnt well from all their previous releases. And for me the best Cthulhu themed game yet.

Immersion in the Mythos is high and the mechanics are very good - luck is inevitable in a game that tests a "skill" against a random factor but there are manyw ays to mitigate the luck so that you do feel much more in control and when it does go bad - well it is Cthulhu!

All the art on the cards and the tokens are the usual FFG high standard - the rules are very well written.

I also have the miniatures released by FFG some years back for added theme - great!

Incredibly fun system with so much room to expand. It is an LCG, so collecting it won't be cheap, but the constant drip of new cards and deckbuilding means that you're not only paying for the game, you're paying for the lifestyle. The co-op nature and excellent solo mode mean that even if you don't have a consistent, hard core gaming group you'll get a lot of millage out of the purchase.

Don't be fooled by the propaganda: it's not an "RPG with cards". Far from it: it requires knowledge about deckbuilding, it requires skill in card games and some scenarios are tough. As always, more than 1 core is recommended (fortunately just 2 are enough). If you can live with the LCG format and love Lovecraft (this time they nailed the theme, unlike in the insulting Elder Sign), go for it. Otherwise, it's best to avoid.

Setup time can be a drag and your first few play throughs will require multiple rules references, but this game achieves a level of theme and story telling that is unparalleled and much better than Mansions of Madness (2nd) which has the benefit of an app. The decisions are also meatier because you have to build a deck before exploring and if you build a poor one, it's that much harder to win. Finally, I like that the game scales its difficulty, so if you want to enjoy the story, you can, but if you want to face a punishing challenge, you can do that too. This is a great game.

The game comes with five investigators but has only cards  to build 2 starterdecks at the same time. Even LotR LCG came with 4 full starterdecks. Fantasy Flight  suggests to buy another basegame enabling you to have all five starterdecks.  But that's illogical because you get double also the story cards and counters which you do not need again.  It would have been less cumbersome if Fantasy Flight put just two investigators in the box and then offering a small expansion with only three additional investigators but  with their complete starterdeck.
However the game is more streamlined than LotR LCG and less mathy, therefore more enjoyable.
First mission was fun, second already a bit tedious.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Enjoyable experience for a card game. Unfortunately Lovecraft's atmosphere was massacred in the process, this definitely is not a coherent experience: what does a thief or a secretery do for you while you are trapped in your study? 

Also I, for some strange reason, in some cards the ghouls are portrayed as if they were goblins.

But these are minor complaints, the game is worth purchasing and playing.

UPDATE
Rated down 0.5 point. It is an ok game and while I believe this is a well done game, I don’t seem to get that whole lot of fun out of it.

Only slightly marred by the potential to become "hand locked / card locked" with cards that do not suit the task at hand.  for this reason, Arkham Horror and Mansions of Madness are games more suited to my taste.  I can tolerate being "hand locked" in faster card games, but in this game, it is more irritating. This is because there is a larger time commitment, dedication to a co-op effort and story involvement.

„Újabb csápbőrbe kötött lapok”
Lovecraft könyveinek, mítoszának FFG játékokba öntött világa kapott egy újabb „gyermeket”, „pénznyelőt”. Akinek az LCG rövidítés, deck-bulding kifejezés mond valamit, az tudja köbö mire számíthat.
Egy biztos, a minőséggel nincs probléma. A kártyajáték lapjai gyönyörűek, szinte külön élmény ilyen játékot a kézbe venni.
A korábban megismert nyomozók köszönnek vissza ránk az új játék mechanikájának megfelelő statisztikával, képességekkel.
A játékban a kártyák jelképeznek (szinte) mindent. Forgatókönyveket, felvonásokat, helyszíneket, tárgyakat, varázslatokat, szövetségeseteket, ellenségeket, a mítosz negatív hatásait. Mellé kapunk jelölőket gazdagon és káosz jelzőket is, amelyek garantáltan megkeserítik a játék során életünket (egyben a kockadobás véletlenszerűségét hivatottak itt megjeleníteni).
Az adott küldetés előkészítése után kezünkbe vesszük kiválasztott nyomozónk meghatározott darabszámú és felépítésű (pakliépítés indul) pakliját és felhúzzuk kezünket (esetleg cserélünk pár lapot).
Első kör kivételével a Mítosz visszavág. Kihívások, nehézségek, ellenfelek. Utána végre lélegzethez jutunk és akciózunk, amelynek keretében 3 akciót hajtunk végre (lehetnek azonosak is): felszerelésünk használata, erőforrások beszerezése, lap felhúzása, harc. Majd következnek a pályán lévő ellenségeink és utána frissülünk. Közben figyeljük, hogyan is haladunk az adott kaland/kampány céljával.
Érdekesség, hogy egyes lapok lehetővé teszik, hogy elmeneküljünk a kalandból, mivel kampány módban a nyomozó halálának következménye is van.
A játékban megjelenik a koop jelleg is, így az egy helyszínen lévő nyomozók lap eldobásával megsegíthetik kis társaikat a nagyobb jó érdekében.
A kaland végén átélt (vagy inkább túlélt) élmények tapasztalati pontot is jelentenek, amivel nekifoghatunk a paklinkba megszerezni a fejlettebb, erősebb lapokat.
Negatívum(ok)ként elmondható, hogy a játék szabályai bár egyszerűnek tűnnek, sok apróságot figyelembe kell venni és már kiadásra került hibajegyzék is. Szóval „szabály-heavy” a játék. Természetesen a szövegezés angol nyelvű és bármilyen magyar fordítás is keletkezik, a játék közbeni ide-oda lapozgatás az élmény rovására megy. Kinek mi, de ha megtetszik a játék, akkor már készítheted is a pénztárcádat, hiszen az alapkészlettel sem tudsz igazi pakliépítésbe fogni, plusz az egyes kalandok (scenario) és kampányok is unalomba fulladnak többszöri végigjátszáskor (persze már most létezik több rajongók által készített jobb-rosszabb kalandok, kampányok, mivel népszerű a játék). A játék bár 2 fővel jól pörög, 3-4 fővel már rá kell szánni azt a 2 órát.
Számomra kettős az „élmény”. Külalakban nincs hiány, kihívás is van gazdagon, lehet nyelvet gyakorolni és – főleg – pénztárcát nyitogatni.

LCG de ambientacion lovecraftiana. 

Es cooperativo, usando el mismo "engine" del popular LCG de El Señor de los Anillos, tambien utilizado en Warhammer Quest LCG. 

Por supuesto, al ser LCG, ya se sabe lo que hay: ciclos de expansiones a saco. 

Por lo visto, jugablemente y tematicamente esta muy bien. el problema de este juego es que con lo que viene de base juegas mas una "intro" que otra cosa (creo que solo vienen DOS escenarios, que aun con algunas variaciones, repetir cualquiera mas de una segunda vez, ya es un dia de la marmota en la mesa), y si te pones a expandir, acabas con un juego de 3000 cartas, mas de 1000 euros y que tienes que meter en un maleton enorme si quieres tenerlo todo junto. 

en mi caso, pendiente de primera partida.

RATING: 5
Nope, that's it, I'm done. I have finished with scrambling for clues to throw at some event so the game can proceed.
The game is also kind of sloppy; you don't see many of your cards in a given game, which undermines deck-building substantially and makes it all the more arbitrary when you draw your weakness.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Dropping this from 9 to 7, after playing a fair few times I don't feel it's as cool or as fun as Eldritch Horror. Also seems worse than LotR LCG as well, now that I've played more. After playing Eldritch again and then this in a row, I am now sure that Eldritch is by far the better game (would always play over this). So this game is going on my no-buy list. Pity, I really wanted to like it. Dropping rating to a 6.

This is everything Arkham and Eldritch Horror wanted to be. Tight story which is affected by your decisions results in a good atmosphere. Probably best played with two, but with fast players 4 is not bad either. I like it that you can finish a scenario in a long evening. (13.11.17)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
The game reminds me a lot of the Lord of the Rings Living Card Game, but Arkham Horror LCG has slightly simpler rules and an outstanding scenario design. Up to now I've played the scenarios from the base box and the first five scenarios of The Dunwich Legacy. All scenarios had mechanisms that suited the story they tell. Recording things in your campaign log nicely ties different scenarios together.

I recommend playing the easy difficulty. I think making all checks harder doesn't add much to the game.

There are also a few things I dislike:
I don't like that the rules are split into a learn to play guide and a rules reference. The learn to play guide is good for the first scenario. After that you have to be careful not to forget to look up monster abilities in the rules reference, if you haven't encountered them yet. And I don't think there are people who like to read an alphabetically ordered rules reference from begin to end.

The Dunwich Legacy box is a cheap thin paper box instead of a real box like the Arkham Horror LCG box itself. Since the prices of the add-on scenarios are not too cheap, I think they could have afforded real boxes.

Light rpg Style Lcg game, with elements from Lotr Lcg and Pathfinder adventures.
Your character is decaying while you deck is upgrading thought the series of small scenarios.
Theme is there, the deckbuilding is meaningfull, you really have to plan your turn, how to best manage your hand and resources in any given situation.
The game is very playable even after several plays.

Definitely hard to learn if you Are not familiar with card games where you build your deck before playing the game, Also the limited deck upgrades between scenarios can be hard to pure card gamers, this is more like one deck to rule emm all Style game.

But if you like card games and Also like roleplaying games, this game is perfect to you!

I personally own four cores, two dunwitch legasy, two miscatonic university etc... so I really have room to build deck just like I want them to be.
The game is like all co-ops hard. So far eleven games of core campaigns at standard difficulty and two victories. So this is definitely easier than Ghost Stories or Robinson Crusoe, but not too easy neither. And if the games seems to be too easy or hard, it is easy to tweak the level by modifuing the chaos back. Very clever system indeed!

Opinions based on playing the base game (2 core sets) and the Dunwich Legacy cycle a few times.
Game play is ok, nothing spectacular. It feels to me like a "Story before mechanisms" sort of game.  Unfortunately, I'm a "mechanisms before story" kind of person.

The randomness in the game can be really frustrating some times. The game rarely lets you feel like you accomplish things based on your prioritizations and decisions. Action results are often at the whims of the token draws. Failure is costly (in terms of actions, health, sanity and other resources), but even more so if you tried to mitigate the token draw but failed.
The game doesn't really have much progression built into the mechanisms. Most cards played into the tableau have a limited amount of uses, making most feelings of engine building and card combo plays short-lived.

The best thing about the game is the campaign structure. Scenarios can have multiple endings, each affecting the coming scenarios in different ways. There are no clear win/lose conditions, but some outcomes are obviously better than others. This really helps brings out the story and increases the immersion.

The deck building before each campaign is good (once you have at least the complete first cycle). It lets you toy with different game concepts depending on what type of character you will be playing. It's nice to work out a plan for which cards shall be in your deck in the beginning and which cards you're aiming to acquire during the campaign.
Upgrading cards between scenarios doesn't feel as interesting as I would have hoped. It's mostly about upgrading cards to other cards that does the same thing but better. I would have preferred a more flexible style of deck-building in mid campaign. Allowing you to redo a scenario with a tweaked deck.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
The greatest of all LCGs. Thematic, challenging, horror/adventure RPG, in the form of a card game. One of the best solo games out there.  Oozes theme (and the theme is HPL...).
It is not for the faint of heart, though...both in-game and out of it.
In-game because in each scenario you will run against the clock to undo the evil plans of otherworldly entities and their human cultists, and at every step you will need to test your mettle against nigh impossible odds... and against the Chaos Bag....
And it is not for the faint of heart for another reason: it will take a lot of money from you.
But it is irrelevant: when you will finish a game you will wish to have more.... more scenarios, more player cards, more investigators.... and luckily you will have all of it. For a long time.

I hate the Lovecraft based games but this one is genius. The cards are used in such creative ways that they really do make the story come to life for me. The game itself is maybe just okay - it's really the story and campaign that are where it's at. You can't take it too seriously as at the end of the day you're at the whims of the chips. Still it's a very entertaining story-based game

This is the game I wanted to get when I bought Arkham Horror 6 years ago. I waited 6 six years for a decent Lovecraft game and now I have it. 

There is a huge drawback though, its completely useless to play with only one core set, so screw ffg.

Update: I lowered the score. The combat is a step back from Arkham Horror and feels too simplistic for my taste. Third mission is too random, actually its so random it doesnt even feel like a puzzle. You just hope for the best. If you buy expansions it probably gets better.

Seems a bit on the dicey side to me.  I often run into situations where it's impossible to win.  If you get bad card draws early, and the encounter deck hits you really hard, the game can end quickly.  I'd say 30% of my losses are not due to my play.  I'm playing on 'easy'.   If one is playing on Standard difficulty, that 30% number will go up. Otherwise it's a fun, and I'd rate it higher if it weren't for the luck factor.

Thematic card game that tells stories. Love making a 'flawed' character and delving into an investigation, where anything can happen! Great encounters, tactical gameplay and great to build a deck. Great for solo and multiplayer. Problem is the card pool is rather limited - half of the cards included are for the story/setting, at least unless you buy lots of expansions. Also, the replayability is quite low, unless you're happy to try and optomise play as a challenge. Once you know the events/story, you will always know what's coming next.

RATING: 8
I like the gameplay, love the theme, love how configurable the difficulty is (to a degree).  Not excited about how expensive it will be in the long run, how I'll store it all, or how often I'll likely replay scenarios.  Also, the more cards get added, the more my pet peeve about CCGs/LCGs will come into play.  I hate when you have 1,000 cards, but you only use 30 of them at a time (per player).  There are going to be a lot of cards that are NEVER chosen to be in a deck and are just wasting space.  There aren't as many of those cards yet, but another year goes by and there will likely be a lot.

So far I have only played through the first scenario in the box, but this has been excellent after a faltering start. Theme is excellent, the idea of creeping doom is easily realised, and the mechanics around using the tokens in an obscured bag is also a welcome change. You should consider buying a wee pouch bag for this! I have now bought a couple of expansions, and will continue to play this in solo mode.

Edit: 6/11/17
After initially liking this, I am now finding it unenjoyable. I think it is around the difficulty. I am better off selling this with the expansions rather than abandoning it in my shelves!

Edit 26/11/17
I've worked it out - I don't like the random element where you draw cardboard tokens out of a bag as a modifier, and how many negative results there are - it makes the game unnecessarily hard.

While I still prefer its spiritual predecessor in Lord of the Rings: The Card Game, I am an enthusiastic fan of this game. FFG took the LotR concept, tweaked it for theme and (admittedly) smoothed over some minor gameplay issues to make a very thematic and enjoyable experience. 

The artwork is gorgeous and definitely evokes the other games in the Arkham Files universe. 

I only have two quibbles with it at the moment. The first is that the rulebook(s) can be somewhat confusing. My group had to reference it pretty consistently throughout the first play. A few vague areas as well took me to the messageboards, and one rule in particular concerning how monsters Spawn was not intuitive. 

The second is that the game screams for expansions for deck building, and I almost wish I would have waited a few months and a larger card pool to begin. 

All in all, recommended.

I really really wanted to enjoy this game after hearing such good things from Shut Up and Sit Down.  Unfortunately, the theme just didn't work for me, the story seemed paper thin, and any character role playing was just extra effort and not as intuitive as I wanted.  If the game play itself was good, that would be a different story, but I found the adventure to be boring, and repetitive, with the only thing changing from chapter to chapter being the little card of narrative.  Overall, the thought of buying more of this frustrates me, and I think I'll just give my copy away.

As close to LOTR LCG as it could be while introducing more narrative-oriented mechanics/scenarios.  Still, each scenario is a puzzle and a challenge (and perfectly playable solo), but more stress is put on the campaign consisting of several scenarios.

I've only played the Base Game. The setup is way too fiddly for the amount of game play length. The need to keep on tearing apart the mystery deck for every adventure is just mind boggling for me. Then comes the LCG money hogging part of the hobby. That I need to purchase new packs every month made me stop pursuing this game. Rather play Eldritch Horror or Mansions of Madness.

RATING: 7.5
My enjoyment of this game has grown over time, although I still have no plans to go 'all in'. It is an ambitious effort, with some great gameplay ideas and rich thematic ingredients. I increasingly appreciate aspects like the variability of the Encounter Deck and extra story-telling layer brought by campaign-play. However, features like the overused draw bag and constrained sense of investigator location/movement, dilute the immersiveness of the experience. Casual players, like myself, may also find the rule set tiringly dense. Still, I have enjoyed some very exciting sessions and anticipate revisiting AH LCG from time-to-time through the standalone scenario packs.

Great atmosphere and mechanics. Only cons are the complicated rules which mean that you will play wrong at times and replaybality. Replayability is due to the fact that once you've played a scenario you've probably discovered large part of the story.

Feels like a more roleplay version of the Lord of the Rings LCG. Less focus on the deckbuilding for specific scenarios instead focusing on the narrative and campaign. The characters are cool and the campaign system is great where your decisions change certain outcomes so that gives it some replayability to try new branches or new characters.

My one main gripe with the game is the chaos bag. It kind of works thematically but the difficulty adjustment is just to add more negative tokens to the bag. I probably won't be playing it on anything higher than normal as the additional difficulty doesn't really add much to the game for me.

Good co-op LCG.  Feels like a revision/improvement on LoTR LCG which is no bad thing.

Unfortunately there's too little in the base box to determine whether this is going to be a great game or just a good one and the value for money is already a big question-mark.  That's to be expected with LCGs but still.

I'll probably grab the first scenario and then I should know if this has legs or whether it simply looses its shine compared to the ongoing costs involved.

Fantastic game. Dripping with theme, and captures the setting perfectly. Almost as fun to play solo as with another investigator. I wish it was a little easier to play with more than two, but you need at least another core set. The rules are fairly easy to pick up, and set up is not too bad either. I wish I got it to the table more often but we usually have a player count higher than 2. The stories are engrossing and the sense of discovery and hidden danger is real. I'd recommend this to almost anyone, even if you are not a Cthulu fan.

Pretty good game; very thematic and the game mechanisms are tight. My only issue with the game is that there isn't enough in the box (and I don't mean for the price).

Needs more campaigns, more scenarios, and more cards. If the Dunwich Cycle is as good as the base game, the options it offers will raise the rating.

One of the better meshes between game and story that I've played so far. But like many linearly based story games, I'm wondering if I'd be interested in the game long term. I'm not sure the mechanisms really hold up, as I feel the game is, by design, pretty unfair. The story element is strong enough to shore up my frustrations I would normally reserve for a game like this after one run through the campaign.

I'm very irritated at the design of the game that you can't really effectively deck-build with only one core set though. That's such a slimy system in my opinion. It feels like an incomplete product. Something I know many are accustomed to, but I am not, and generally have held back on games like this that encourage that sort of behavior.

Empezando por lo malo: es un LCG. El resto todo es bueno. juego de cartas inmersivo que consigue meterte en una aventura de Lovecraft. El modo campaña está muy conseguido y aunque pueda parecer que no tiene rejugabilidad, la tiene (aunque buena parte del factor sorpresa desaparezca, mantiene la dificultad y el objetivo de seguir nuevos caminos). La confección de mazos no es tan "importante" como en otros juegos similares del estilo al LoTR LCG. Personalmente me encanta.

Successfully completed the first scenario of the campaign and I suspect that, over time, we will continue the campaign to its bloody conclusion. It was certainly interesting, even if the game play (and set up) was a bit clunky for my taste. I'm also quite certain that your level of enjoyment is strongly impacted by how engaged your fellow investigator(s) is in the story. Fortunately, I had a fully engaged partner.

Arkham Horror meets LOTR: The Card game, thankfully with the playtime of the latter and the theme of the former. Apart from sharing characters and theme it does not play anything like Arkham Horror, it does not evoke the epic scale doom and gloom of its namesake but scratches a completely different, more intimate horror itch, and scratches it well.

RATING: 9.25
What an exhilarating new card game!  In time, this will likely replace LotR LCG if the quality remains high.  The deck building is not overly complex, but still allows for interesting decisions to be made.  The way locations are handled is absolutely brilliant.  Lastly, the theme is flawlessly implemented in.  Top notch stuff here!

RATING: 8
The first game was slow but fun. There are many times you need to check the rules reference in the first game but this is a ffg lcg after all so that was expected :) The fact that they ditched the dice for pugs was quite interesting since you can set the difficulty on the go. I also liked the fact that you can use cards for skills checks or you can use them for what they do. The bad cards in your deck like amnesia are also felt quite thematic. Got rid of it after not feeling the urge to play it and because it would be expensive.

I've only played once. It was okay but didn't really push me to play it again. Having a persistent deck that you build up between games seems interesting and if I ever get to that, I'm sure I will enjoy it more. At this point I'd rather play Mansions of Madness 2ed though. I won't rate until I've played through the core box at least.

Hihetetlenül tematikus, hangulatos, mesélős játék. Nem vagyok nagy szerepjáték rajongó, de ez a szint nagyon bejön. Érdekes, hogy LCG-hez képest egészen táblajátékszerű a játékmenet a különböző helyszínek közötti rohangálás miatt. Remek ötletek vannak benne, mindenféleképpen többször játszós az alapdoboz is, hiszen ha egybefüggő történetként játsszuk végig a jeleneteket, a döntéseink miatt legközelebb más utat járhatunk be.

Sajna a szokásos FFG-s folyamatos szabályértelmezés, olvasgatás itt is benne van, de már olyan jól beletanultam a többi játékuknál ebbe. :P

Cooperative LCG probably at its best. Improvement rulewise from Lord of the Rings, which I like more due to lore. Beautiful art on cards and Legacy gameplay style is a big plus. Sometimes it is too prohibitive. It can get expensive for a bunch of cards however.

Played scenario 1 with the gf, made a few errors which made it really easy - despite this we both enjoyed it. We replayed scenario 1 and it correctly and it was much tenser and, therefore, better. Scenario 2 was also enjoyable, we got 4 of the bad guys.

This is the GF's first taste of the Cthulhu Mythos; I think she's more interested in the horror theme than the details of the Mythos; whatever, she's pre ordered all the expansions.

Realised yesterday that Im really not that fussed about this. It seems a bit too fiddly and (as usual with FFG) the rules are poor (that weird state of being both vague and pedantically detailed). Think this is going to the Great Exchange in the Sky.

2 Cores. Fantastic game - the narrative is excellent, but there is plenty of room for good (and bad) play, so it delivers on both the experience and the strategy front. The cards having dual purpose (play them or use them to boost skills) means that almost every turn provides meaningful decisions. The replay value is great - first time through a scenario is a ride, a wild one - like driving with your eyes closed, and in the same way, it will likely cause you to crash. Subsequent plays are much more strategic, since you know what's coming - but randomised events and locations keep it from becoming stale. Highly recommended if you like co-operative, customisable card games. On the negative side, it is an expensive game to keep up with (like all LCGs/CCGs), but it is very worth it.

Good solid mechanics, definite improvements in accessibility and playability.

However, the core game campaign is way too short. High chance you'll never see the cards you purchase between scenarios, and not very many choices to make when you do. You can replay it several times, but "campaign" is really a misnomer.

Feels far less complete as an LCG core set than Netrunner or LotR did. You'll need to buy a complete campaign cycle (deluxe expansion + 6 cult packs) for this to have a chance to reach its potential.

Sold at Endgame auction in October 2017.

Be careful - has the trappings of a CCG or LCG.

In the game, you and your friend (or up to three friends with two Core Sets) become characters within the quiet New England town of Arkham. You have your talents, sure, but you also have your flaws. Perhaps you've dabbled a little too much in the writings of the Necronomicon, and its words continue to haunt you. Perhaps you feel compelled to cover up any signs of otherworldly evils, hampering your own investigations in order to protect the quiet confidence of the greater population. Perhaps you'll be scarred by your encounters with a ghoulish cult.

[2017.Mar.30] This is an intriguing amalgamation of an LCG and an RPG. A much better co-op game than FFG's [i]The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game[/i] and better designed for replayability. Intentionally slow deck tuning of the course of a campaign (multiple scenarios), as opposed to hyper-deck tuning associated with so many other card games, makes the game less about having the perfect cards and more about playing what you have. The game does an excellent job of conveying the mystery & helplessness so often associated with Mythos stories... you don't win, you survive.

Best Co-Op in my opinion. My girlfriend loves it and I really enjoy the Lovecraft theme although I'm not a big Cthulhu fanboy. The only gripe are the rules which are pretty complex and often not that intuitive. At least half of my plays had some mistakes in it which I discovered afterwards. But in the end it just matters that we had a lot of fun!

RATING: 7.3
Played the first scenario twice. Once on easy and again on hard. It's quite punishing.

The dice rolling ("bag of chaos") is the worst aspect of the game, putting a massive RNG spin on everything, in a cumbersome token-drawing bag. This is in-line with other existing Arkham Horror titles out there, but I was hoping the card game would move away from the luck-based nature of other titles. It is not AS random as Arkham Horror the board game, but does hit many of the same notes.

The narrative and scenario design is clever. The card designs too. Well designed overall.  Will update on subsequent plays.

[update] Sold this off after dying twice on the final encounter. I actually love that the game is challenging and you're not guaranteed to win, however, I had the distinct impression that you had to just "keep trying" until getting the correct lucky card draws and monster spawns - similar to how the Arkham Horror board game is ultimately made or broken by the RNG elements as well. With the deck customization absolutely minimal (basically choosing card A, B, or C for each deck!), I lost the sensation that I was succeeding or failing based on our decisions and strategy. 

Gf still loved the game and was mad I sold it, lol.

I vowed that I would never get into a living CCG or LCG my entire life. But oh Arkham Horror you tempted me with the gameplay of [gameid=205059] driving me made with desire to play something as thematic and story driven. Like an investigator finding their first clue of otherworldly going's on a succumbed the siren call of the unknown and jumped into this game head first. I loved it from the first scenario. There isn't anything about this game that I don't enjoy from the artwork to the deck building to the stories they are telling. I eagerly anticipate each new mythos pack and what mysteries they will unfold in the world this game has constructed.

Bei diesem Spiel ist es ähnlich zu Legacy Spielen oder Time Storys Fällen, es darf nicht zu viel verraten werden.
Mir gefällt das Spiel sehr gut, da es mit wenig Deckbau viel Geschichte erzählt und man hier und da Entscheidungen treffen muss, die in nachfolgenden Szenarien dann Konsequenzen haben werden.
Ich hab bei dieser Kampagne alle Entscheidungen meiner Mitspielerin überlasssen, da ich sie schon spielte und sie hat ganz anders entschieden als ich damals, was in einer anderen Geschichte und in einem Sieg endete (Ich bin damals daran gestorben, sie ist hier nur Wahnsinnig geworden, aber "geschafft" haben wir es trotzdem...
Alles in allem ein sehr schönes Spiel, für mich das Beste in der Lovecraft Welt.

The best LCG, in my opinion, currently on the market.  I think the mechanics are cool, the limitations on deck building is a real plus, and the theme is spot on.  Similar to FFG's Mansion's of Madness, I think the innovation inherent in this release has much to offer in the future.  The current stories are really interesting and the two POD releases are excellent but I think the true strengths of this card game are on the horizon and I believe Nathan, Matt and the rest of the design team will get even more creative in the future and blow our minds concerning what this system, with this theme, is capable of.

Still enjoying LOTR LCG and really wished there was more content to be released for Warhammer Quest LCG. But now AH LCG seems to have taken all the good stuff from those two games and made something even more amazing out of it. I'm really excited to see what the expansions bring to this.

Arkham Horror scratches so many itches for me: customization, risk taking, thematic exploration of a universe, team work, resource management in multiple dimensions.

Every investigator is unique, bringing strengths, skills, resources, and abilities that set them apart. Each session brings a unique set of challenges and I love how they implemented campaign play, where decisions are crucial but the game system allows for sandbox play as well.

The theme will turn off some people (including my significant other), but the mechanics are a beautiful set of interactions.

My first LCG.

Pros:
- Building an initial card deck and then spending XP between scenarios to tweak it is great
- Using cards/skills to counter your opposition stacked with the random draw (token bag) is exciting and feels like you have "some" control over the luck
- Exploring a scenario for the first time is thrilling
- The unique investigator strengths/weaknesses means there's a fair bit of variety to encourage replay

Cons:
- Core package is very stingy -- no cloth bag, no storage baggies, insert not suitable for any expansion
- Core package only has one campaign (playable in three parts)

It's certainly very thematic but the fiddliness of the set up took me out.  Intentional lack of duplicate cards in the single core set also detracted from the offering.

RATING: 10
I waited to rate the game until enough content has been released. This rating is based on my plays up to the third scenario in The Path to Carcosa cycle. I am rating this game a 10 based on the enjoyment I have experienced playing it, and it is the game I want to play the most. If you only own the core set, it's a 8 or 9 rating based on the design and narrative. Start with the core set and if you enjoy the narrative and mechanics, and are having fun, purchase the Dunwich Legacy cycle. The extra content really makes this game better. Since this is a expandable card game, my rating could change based on future content. 
You can have a lot of fun with a core set and even more with another cycle, either Dunwich Legacy or The Path to Carcosa. There are some negatives, the game is rather expensive if you want to continue the narrative and want the extra player cards in the expandable packs. The game also requires you to purchase two core sets if you want to play 3-4 players (1-2 can play with one core set). I really think you need two core sets just to get doubles of player cards in the core set. With further expansions this may be unnecessary if the player cards in the core set can be replaced by cards in the expansions. The only argument I have against the expense is that this is a cooperative game, so you only need to expand as you wish. You do not need expand to compete as in a competitive game. You may chose which content to purchase on your own schedule  This is the game I wished Lord of the Rings Card Game was, as I enjoy the Lord of the Rings theme better.

RATING: 7
I want to love this game and there are certainly aspects of it that I do love, but I feel like it has been targeted too thoroughly at MtG-style gamers who have the time to create ridiculous optimizations and combos within their decks.  I, too often, end up feeling like I don't have a valuable contribution to make on a given turn, as I wait for the right cards to show up from my deck.  That said, I love how flexible the system is in its storytelling and how thematic everything is.

so far an 8 as I am not far into the game but how it is developing and with all the extra accessories I will get

My estimation is that this game can very well be a 9-9,5 or even a 10. 

Lets see. I wont rate it definitely before not finishing Dunwich legacy

EDIT: After playing Dunwhich main box and Carnivale this is a 9. I do recommend not playing it easy. Much more interesting to really depend on a well thought through deck or just letting a new investigator let himself try.
Replayability also is much higher this way. 

Well that leads mostly to crushing defeat in Carnivale. All the more fun :-)

RATING: 6
The ultimate board game for me would probably involve a very strong adventure feel, with ideally character progression, each game having a strong narrative and not feeling samey from the previous yet having high replayability, scale well solo, retain a good amount of decision making, and not require lots of metagaming. 

LOTR LCG failed in this regard due to having heavy metagaming, not scaling well solo, and the need to construct anew destroying any sense of progression. The D&D adventure board games failed due to weak progression, and each scenario being a batch of random monsters before a final boss fight killing off a narrative. Mice and Mystics failed by having too little decisions and limited replayability. Warhammer Quest Adventure Card Game had the most potential and had as a bonus some unique coordination between heroes needed, but the loss of IP along with the core set feeling more mechanical than narrative made it fall. Mansions of Madness had terrible replayability, and remembering spoilers felt more important than strategy in its decision making during repeated plays.

My first play of Arkham Horror LCG it seemed like I had come closest to this "ultimate game" (well not as my favorite game, but the best implementation in the genre of my "ultimate game) I've ever been. How the game sets you up from the get-go really gives the feeling of hopelessness that I would expect from this genre, and the different scenario resolutions with mysterious text to write down in your campaign notes, promises of pseudo-legacy effects (without overdoing it with the difficulty of balancing legacy games) really aided the narrative. The XP system seemed to promise on character progression, and the lack of reconstructing your deck after each scenario seemed to aid in both character progression and not having to metagame. The different encounter decks per scenario (also one of the strong suits of LOTR LCG) made each scenario feel different even prior to the climax, and the physical moving between locations felt better than the more abstracted locations of LOTR LCG or WQ:tACG. The fact you'll draw different starting hands each game and that there are different hero classes with completely different decks promised replayability. There weren't any scenario-specific things that didn't seem to scale poorly solo.

However, future plays made me enjoy the game significantly less. There are some resolutions that are near impossible (and one that is actually impossible if a certain card is drawn). Now that doesn't mean the game is near impossible to win for certain characters, but at the end of the first scenario the resolution choices also made it seem like the game would have diverging narratives based on your past actions. The more straitjacketed narrative isn't really a flaw per se, but  is more that I thought the game would be head and shoulders above its peers in narrative, and later found out it only executes about the same level.

The cards in the coreset are very limited in deck building. Even if you were intentionally trying to replace as many cards as possible I think you would only be able to change out a third of each character's deck compared to the recommended set. The poor deck building is exacerbated by the fact that certain cards are really really important to have early (with not enough options to sift through your deck for them), and that some cards are really poor unless combo'd with other cards or character powers, but you need to include such poor cards with the characters that don't have such combos due to card requirements. Clearly this issue will be alleviated with expansions, but how much do I need to get into this game before this aspect is fixed? Also the XP system is a lot weaker than I thought it would be, not just because there aren't that many card options to buy, but also you are maybe replacing 10% of your deck after each scenario. With maybe 60% of cards drawn per scenario, that is less than 2 cards changed per game. This does mean it is possible to play scenarios out of order however.

The different scenarios did feel fairly different from each other, however I didn't like how the second scenario and non-hunter monsters felt more like you were coming at the game rather than the game coming at you. This is a non-issue for Mage Knight fans, but for someone like me who likes the never ending swarm that Ghost Stories throws at you, this made the second scenario feel less tense.

The different characters do in fact have a fairly different play style, for example Roland thrives off of picking off weak monsters while Wendy needs to constantly dance around to avoid them. My favorite character is probably Agnes due to her utility with her spells and mitigating their often negative horror infliction (that make the spells almost bad for other characters) a positive thing, while my least favorite is probably Daisy, who is way to reliant on getting a good tome out quickly. There is also enough replayability to play the same scenario with the same deck and character after awhile.

While the tokens generally scale based on number of players, there are some plot-related things in the second and third scenario that have no scaling whatsoever. I'm not necessarily opposed to some differences in difficulty for different player counts, but the blatancy of this just makes it lazy design. Also, the lack of having another character to synergize with really hurts and makes the game seem like it has the swingy encounter cards that LOTR LCG has. For example, there is one monster that basically doubles the doom placed each round unless defeated. With 2 players one hero is bound to be able to have enough strength to defeat it, but if you are soloing with Wendy have fun having your available time cut in half, unless you just so happen to have the card that lets you remove a monster you are evading. Again, this might be less of an issue with expansions.

A lot of the luck mitigation of this game also seems to having a full hand size so you can boost your stats when doing checks. However, one of the weaknesses discards your cards, making it hard to mitigate, and the second scenario and the much more feasible resolution for the 3rd scenario depending on which character you are playing are basically races. This makes the luck of your starting hand much more apparent as you don't have enough time to spend actions to constantly keep your hand well stocked.

In many ways this really eclipses the LotR game, however, it's also something that seems to benefit playing campaigns rather than a single play, making it more of an investment than LotR.

Ultimately, however, it succeeds in every way, and with more content under its belt, has the variety it needed.

Great game and surprisingly different from the other LCG titles by FFG. This game feels a lot more like Mansions of Madness than one would think at first. Instead of a board and miniatures you get a deck, which represents your investigator.

[b][thing=205637][/thing][/b] is somewhat similar to the earlier Cthulhu themed games from [company=17][/company] which initially I didn't particularly like and then learned to love, okay, enjoy.  This one, however, I'm having a harder time with.  I think it's because FFG have added more story through the campaign booklet and the act and agenda cards while at the same time removing the flavour that the older games have with encounter cards at each location.  At the same time, they've reduced rolling a handful of dice to pulling a single token from a bag.  All in all, the game is drier and more procedural than it's predecessors.  Which, really, for me, isn't [i]usually[/i] a bad thing.  After all, I like Euros.  And I like [b][thing=77423][/thing][/b].  So I should like [b][thing=205637][/thing][/b].  But I don't.

[Played 4 times]

It's horribly shallow.

Tokens are just there for the novelty factor (they would be like cards, but they are always returned to the bag so they are just dice; pro: you can customize the faces of the dice during setup to set your chances to win higher or lower as desired; con: it is annoyingly longer and clumsier than rolling dice).

Deckbuilding does not exist (you'll need expansions for that).

Strategy is as banal as it gets (you just specialize in one aspect - fighting, investigating, etc. - and keep doing that over and over).

The "choose your own adventure" elements try to give it a narrative (that would like to be Lovercraftian to boot...), but mostly manage to limit the replayability.

I think this is a good game, but it just isn't for me. I find the book keeping, the leveling and especially the setup a little bit too fiddly. The game play itself is solid, though nothing special either. I also don't like the fact, that entire card sets are only used for one scenario and then you don't see these cards ever again. Considering that expansions are not particularly cheap and the fact that there is not a lot of replayablity, I find it especially sad to have entire sets only used for one scenario. 

The art work is fantastic and I also like that you can adjust difficulty to your liking. However, I don't think I will invest much more into this.

I have the Lord of the Rings LCG and Eldritch Horror and this is a great combination of the two. LotR was okay but this game fixes a lot of issues that I had with that. All the cards have good flavor/narrative text on them so a game unfolds like a story. The game can be quite challenging but there are multiple endings to a scenario so even if you lose one you can still continue on with the campaign. 

Overall my favorite Lovecraftian game to date, I will definitely be buying a bunch of the expansions.

After going through the campaign a second time, I wanted to revise a few points, though my opinion of the game only improved.  I still think that unless you want an RPG-like story this game is not for you.  However, there is more game here than was obvious at first.  The deck building and multiple use of cards creates tense and interesting decision before the game, when you build your deck, and during the game, when you try to decide how to best use each card.  Replay value is better than I thought.  Although the main story points remain the same, the obstacles create different situations and the scenarios play out differently each time.  The main story, which is formulaic predictable, is the weakest part of the game anyway.  The details of how the main story points are resolved is interesting and engaging, making this game shine.

Oh dear! After 11 plays I have lost both my starting Investigators: Roland retired with too many Mental Traumas to be worth playing and Wendy was Killed [o]by a Scenario outcome[/o]

It's really shades of LotR all over again: bad card draws and you're fucked. In LotR this was a ball-ache, but you could reset and go again. But in AHTCG you're playing a scenario-based campaign so you can't go back and do it over, you carry that failure into the next Scenario and the next while it all gets worse and worse.

I'm going to try the starter scenario with all the Investigators in the hope that one of them will win through. But the problem is I'll then take that Investigator into the next Campaign and lose while trying to learn [I]that[/I] campaign. So then I'll have to learn the new Campaign with new Investigators. Essentially I see any given Investigator as being good only for one Campaign. 

At this point it looks like I'll do the Dunwich cycle and then bail - if I don't bail before the end.

Update @17 plays. This one has gone the way of LoTR: I love the concept, but I'm not motivated to put in the effort to figure out a good deck to play an Investigator with. Added to that I don't like having multiple runs through a campaign game, it makes it less like a campaign than I wanted. It's a well executed game design that I just don't happen to like. It'll go on the "For Trade" heap.

Of all the LCG's I have played and or tried this one is the only I want to play now. So much story and options every turn feels like a real choice that makes a difference. Only drawback is they should have made the base set with a full playset of all cards.

RATING: 7
Narrativement réussi, c'est en effet réellement Horreur à Arkham mais en jeu de carte.
Plus rapide d'accès que le Seigneur des anneaux grâce notamment à une création de deck simplifiée (et très limitée ??), mais par la même il m'a semblé moins profond. Différent ? oui. Meilleur ? pas eu cette impression, dépend ce qu'on cherche.

RATING: 8
A tense and thematic game.  The resource arrangements are more forgiving than lord of the rings LCG, and it seems less epic in scope.  But it is richer in story, and borrows a lot of the mechanisms.  Plus I expect that the deck building options will be more forgiving.  I'm pretty invested in the LotR LCG already thought.

Unexpected, but it ended up a game where I found myself with zero interest of playing it after the initial two missions. Probably the LCG silliness that creates a shell of a game with the promise of letting you pay more money to flesh it out down the road.

Picked this up to play solo while traveling over the holidays. May drop by my local store this weekend for a learning game. The leveling system looks good and I like the fact that you keep moving through the story even if you fail. The random element of checks makes the game less of a math puzzle then LOTR LCG.

RATING: 3
In short:
I really did look forward to play this game and really did want to play it. But the incompleteness of rules and lack of effort in card descriptions just made me feel that this game was way too rushed and not polished at all.

Who do I recommend to?
If you are eager for an RPG like board game, with very loosely interpreted complex rules with a heavy entry barrier and don't really care to play by the book. (aka. know exactly how the rules should be interpreted)

Who do I don't recommend it to?
Anyone who have played magic the gathering or similar complex game with a desire to know how the cards exactly work.

Pros:
- You can really play it in an RPG fashion and have stay-in-character conversations.
- The game can really surprise you in many ways
- It really does have a blend of darkness if you are open for RPG
- Many unique cards
- Very good card and image quality
- Custom deckbuilding before play

Cons:
- Movement is way too much restricted the campaign is very linear
- Once you know the locations themselves, there is no surprise factor, so it's lot less fun to play a particular mission again.
- Long and elaborate game setup before play. Had to pick my entire deck one by one matching tiny numbers that could have been printed a lot bigger.
- Card descriptions are hard to decipher. They are sometimes too short and vague to understand, despite plenty of space for text on the card.
- Rules Reference has lot of concepts missing. Half of the keywords or things I tried to look up was missing from there.
- The game feels incomplete and unpolished. The main rule of thumb is that if you can't find a rule, just apply the way it's affects you the worst way. Which is a terrible excuse for missing rules, especially that it wasn't even applicable for the situations.
- It is definitely longer than 2 hours, even if you are experienced, I can't see it being just an hour. Unless you manage to loose early on somehow - maybe on hard difficulty.
- On top of the basic situations are poorly documented, there are many exceptions or edge cases that take a lot of effort to work out.
- Punishing weaknesses that you can do nothing about. Ex: throw away all your cards - which actually meant loosing 7 cards from a full hand!!!

Deckbuilding:
- I didn't get to the deck-building phase, but it looks like that might give a bit of an additional fun, if you are a really big fan of the game.

So I wasn't very impressed with the game from the beginning, But i chalked it up to me learning the rules etc. So I played through several times. I changed characters, experimented with upgrades etc. I even played through an expansion. Once I had the rules down, I realized that it wasn't learning the rules that was dragging down my experience. The game is just boring. I also don't like the token draw mechanism at all.

I enjoyed playing through the full three-game campaign of the basic set. The rules aren't too hard to grasp, though I never felt sure of what were the best tactics.

In the end, it was pretty fun, pretty Lovecraftianish and pretty well put together.

My character did a very bad thing that I'm not proud of. But we won. I think. And when I say we I mean me because the other guy's character died. Tough luck, buddy.

RATING: 9.6
Yes! I'm a long time player of LOTR LCG, always keeping up with the releases, always having a blast when we play it. At this stage though, having all the cards forces us to follow some house rulings due to it now is more than possible to build decks that completely demolishes the quests, and although they release new expansions regularly not much poses any challenge for us anymore - not counting Nightmare versions that indeed still can make things harder. Looking forward to this, hoping it is HARD to solve the mysteries due to it's design, and not just because of some totally random mechanic like the always-fail chit in the 'chaos bag'. Time will tell. If it's a cakewalk, the cores will be all that I own.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
With a simple deck of cards, Arkham Horror LCG inspires the sense of adventure and dread from the original game, but in the space of an hour and with streamlined game play. A scenario is like an episode of a great TV show, handling story and progression, each one of them imbued with a unique sense of space and adversary. This is the first time in my board gaming hobby that I felt truly immersed into a world, and I hope they never cease to surprise me.

I guess I don't like LCGs. While I love the theme, this game felt very mechanical. I play cards to gather clues and fight monsters. Then story progresses.

Maybe I miss the fiddly-ness of chits and dice?

Very much appreciate the fast setup and play time compared to Eldritch Horror. Mechanics so far (core set only) are fun and combat feels pretty good with the Engage/Fight/Evade actions. I like the differences between characters and there seems plenty of potential for interesting campaigns with the more structured approach to story-telling and the branching paths based on actions. Overall a little more friendly to players than EH as a defeat does not necessarily mean death, but instead changes the state of the subsequent scenarios.

We are casual players when we're at LCG, so we bought (only!) a single core, plus the Dunwich cycle. Just to play coop :D

This game is really something. Plenty of fun, fast play, excellent narrative (so far) and choices. The chit-pulling works great and allows a fine-tuning in difficulty (and so, your enjoyment). Lot of replay value.

Very impressed: this is a truly plastic engine, able to handle very different situations. 

Big choice. Recommended!

The high difficulty level (even on the game's so-called easy mode), while thematically appropriate, does not make for fun gameplay, in my opinion.  The difficulty would likely be alleviated by deck construction, however, this isn't really an option without buying an additional core set.  I am also not a fan of this sort of distribution model.

Sin lugar a dudas! El mejor juego basado en Cthulhu a la fecha. No hay dudas, y porque? Porque logra hacerte sentir que estás en esta aventura casi imposible buscando derrotar a los primigenios y a sus secuaces. Es una mezcla perfecta de juego de rol con juego de mesa, de cartas, que permite rápidamente sumergirte en el mundo de Cthulhu sin las tediosas reglas de un Arkham Horror Boardgame o el armado y semanas de juego de un Call Of Cthulhu. 
Sobre el sistema de cartas, no he podido probar otros juegos (LofR, Netrunner, GoT) pero por lo que he podido jugar, es un juego que te permite sentir que estas en situaciones complicadas y que el azar tiene que estar de tu mano, pero siempre con un cierto grado de control, que finalmente es tu clase y el mazo que armaste. 
Totalmente obligatorio para aquellos jugadores de AH BG, EH BG, MofM 2E (1E). Es momento de tenerlo ya!

Arkham Horror, this is not. 

This is yet another game that tries to capture the feel of a Lovecraftian story. This time, in card game form. Even though I went into this with some trepidation, I wanted to give it a try since Arkham Horror is my favorite board game. For the most part, I thought the game was decent. If nothing else, it flowed very smoothly, and the drawing chits out of a bag, while sometimes frustrating, was a different approach to the same old skill checks these games are known for. It works well enough, but I don't see why they needed to make this when it would have been just as easy to come up with more scenarios for Mansions of Madness. If I'm going to play a game with this theme, I want it to either be epic (Arkham Horror), tense (Mansions of Madness), or story-driven (Mythos Tales). This game doesn't really accomplish any of those things any better than what has come before. This is just Fantasy Flight's attempt at cashing in on yet another IP that has sold well in the past. Seriously...if you want a solo game with this theme, any of the other games that have already come out are just as good as this, if not better.

Struggles in comparison with Lord of the Rings LCG at the moment purely because of the availability of adventures, and there is a lot of fiddling in setup and sometimes gameplay, plus you do need two core sets.  But with just the base game alone there is already a tonne of potential and I can't wait for the expansions to start landing.  Plays really well in true solo and in multiplayer, and the campaign play plus only having to control one hero gives it the edge back over the Lord of the Rings LCG.

I was not a big fan of this game the first few times I played it.  It reminded me a lot of the struggles you have in Shadowrun Crossfire.  I was ready to give up entirely, but decided to play a demo game at Dice Tower CON 2017 to make sure my feelings were justified.  We lost that game too, but I came out of it determined to not let this game beat me.  There is plenty to like here, you just need to take your lumps to get good.

Only played the four player game. I suspect it will be better with two player so I may amend my rating. My favorite part of this game is seeing how the story unfolds during the investigations.

I've only played this with four players and I don't think that is the ideal way to experience the game. It really slows things down. I need to play a full scenario arc with only two players.

I just wish that the scenarios were all linked so that one character could be used for all of my games.

Unlike any other card game I've played (I haven't played LotR LCG). In a sense it's a card game because almost all the components are cards but it could just as well have been tiles for the location and miniatures for the monsters.

Great atmosphere and fun mechanics.

The campaign in the core set is very good because it shows the different mechanics in the game and is overall a great campaign.

I own two core sets for 4-player play.

The core set is not worth its money. There is no real deck building possible, one tutorial and two scenarios is all it offers and there is no chaos bag included - although its kind of the whole twist of this game

The mechanics however are ok but nothing special. I like the idea of the chaos bag but it feels clunky and doesn't add much to the game. 

This doesn't really feel that thematic to me either. E.g.: starting your first game in a room with no entrance or exit but nonetheless your very first action can be recruiting a policeman just doesn't work for me. Additionally I have some issues with the idea of Cthulhu-themed games evolving around combat so much.

The ongoing campaign format, with replayable scenarios released monthly, is EXACTLY the type of game I have always wanted.  The strategy of deck building and the decision making during the super creative mechanics BOTH dripping with great artwork and theme make this a complete package of gaming greatness.  It gets my second "10" joining Space Hulk - Death Angel as a favorite game.  
[B]TTS Play:[/B] Started with starter deck solo plays of the intro scenario with base box investigators.  Roland Banks managed to score 4 Victory Points by clearing out the Attic and the Cellar as well as defeating the Ghoul Priest.  It was a blast, and perhaps a bit lucky with respect to the Mythos effects.  The Ghoul Priest was taken out with a clutch stick of dynamite (after a timely resource boost) and a forceful knife jab (buffed by a skill modifier card).  FFG did not disappoint and now I am all in on the entire line.  Second play was with the challenging soloist, Daisy.  I had the PERFECT plan lined up to take out the Ghoul Priest (Mind over Matter and two knife attacks with resource buffed traits).  Instead, I drew Stubborn Detective and the d-bag foiled everything.  Great story.  Fun game.  Play three was even more tense as little Wendy tried desperately to take out the Ghoul Priest.  She had one shot, and failed (both draws)!  So close!  Play four left Skids with one horror and a dead Ghoul Priest, thanks again to dynamite and a buffed knife strike (3 VPs).

I just played it with 2 players. It was a lot of fun, even when the first session was kind of complicated  to get along with the rules and stuff. For me it took a bit long to sort the cards and get into it. But on the other hand it is one of the most immersive games i have ever played. Also it has a good replayability by mixing up the cards and get different storylines by events everytime. The ressourcemanagement and balancing seem to be on top.
Just a lot of cards and some rules, which can be hard to get into it and took a while to get started into a round. I have printed some sheets from the internet to sort the cards on a table.

"The oldest and strongest emotion of mankind is fear, and the oldest and strongest kind of fear is fear of the unknown." (H.P. Lovecraft) This game incarnates this statement well: every decision is stressful because you don't know its implications... or whether it'll simply kill you! Possibly one of the best streamlined implementation of Arkham, with a strong thematic feel. Tough décisions to make, heartbreaking trade-offs and a high push your luck factor that make this game an engaging experience. However, be aware that a game can be entirely ruined out of pure misfortune.

The first coop card game that actually feels like an RPG!
The graph-like locations, the action system and the character progression system take the strengths of many of FFG's previous LCG's and combine them into a single, solid product.

The only gripe I have with it is the lack of content out of one - or even two - core sets. Has the potential to truly become a masterpiece.

RATING: 10
I'm playing this two player with my partner, and it's totally blowing me away. I've always loved the Lovecraft theme, but Fantasy Flight's other co-op efforts have never quite hit home. The theme just never came through heavily enough. The LCG format is perfect for this type of game, because you're playing through a more carefully crafted story, rather than just random Lovecraftian stuff thrown together. One of my favourite games.

RATING: 2
I have thought a lot about this game since I first played it and finally decided to rate it. It is a 2 for me. If you are reading my review, keep in mind that I normally play euros and this is my first LCG. 
There are lots of things to like: the art is excellent. The story is not bad, too (seems to be much better thought out than Time Stories Asylum, but it probably is due to Lovecraft's established universe, not the designers.) The card quality is good, too. 

Unfortunately, nothing else in the game per se worked for me. 

First of all, it is very luck based. You get a cup with tokens and basically all you do when you fight or evade enemies is compare the skill level you have at the moment to that of the monster you're fighting and add a random modifier token from the cup which can hurt you or help you. That's basically it. That's the whole game. To mitigate this luck factor you are encouraged to build your own better deck (usually by buying extra packs of cards). So, yes, you can mitigate this luck a little bit by building a 'stronger' deck, but all in all, it boils down to 'roll a 6, defeat your enemy', 'roll a 1, try again'.  I really don't get how people can say that, for instance, card draws in Agricola are luck based and totally glaze over when it comes to luck here. Agricola is Go compared to Arkham Horror the card game. 

Still, all this luckfest could have been ok, honestly. I mean when I go see a summer blockbuster in a theater I do it to have fun. I don't overanalyze and actively search for plot holes. It's sheer mindless fun that you have for 2 hours and then forget about. This Arkham Horror game could have served the same purpose. Unfortunately, it doesn't, because to me, the system is quite convoluted and you have to invest a lot into studying how various cards work together, how enemies work etc. To me, it's just not worth it. I would have played it just to see where the story takes me if it were an app and all the upkeep was done for me, but as it is there are too many other great boardgames to waste your time learning all the nooks and crannies of this system.

Just completed the main campaign with the 2 default investigators on standard difficulty. Had to play solo as games with too much reading not up the wife's alley.

Story is pretty cool but even at standard difficulty, scenarios 2 and 3 were pretty difficult. I just don't see a second playthrough having the same amount of excitement as the first time through unfortunately owing to the element of novelty

As a hardcore hearthstone player, I believe I will enjoy the deck building aspect of it but that will require 2 core sets of which I'm not willing to commit to at the moment..

As it is with one core set and having played through the campaign once, this puts the game as slightly over average for me

Incredible game, my wife and I have played through the core and the Dunwich campaigns as well as the Curse of the Rougarou and Carnival of Horrors stand alones. 

I have not had any problems owning a single core set, as I primarily enjoy working through the stories, rather than min / maxing my decks. Now that I have most of two cycles worth of expansions, there are plenty of options for upgrades. 

This is currently a 10/10 game for me, and I look forward to each new mythos pack as it is released. Its not a game I can play every game night, but when we do play it I enjoy every minute of it.

RATING: 10
The rubric for a 10 is "Will always enjoy playing." I can't really know if that's the case. If there's anything this game "wants" to teach us, it's that our future is uncertain. Maybe one day I'll suddenly hate it, won't be able to stand the sight of it; but for now my favorite part of this game isn't even playing it -- it's introducing other people to it. I love DMing this game. Though strictly speaking it doesn't need a DM, the game goes more smoothly when someone is running it for you, paying attention to the rules, the turn order, the corner cases. Most of all I love watching people get into the mood of the game as I load up a spooky playlist and then read the scenario and agenda cards to them. I love celebrating the lucky pulls, agonizing over the unlucky draws with them.

The fact I can play this game solo is a huge bonus for me. The buy-in is pretty real, but the fact that I haven't regretted the game's cost is a huge testament to how enjoyable the game is. I've got two core sets, the base Dunwich box and its first two expansion packs, and finally the Rougarou POD. That's nearly $200 so far. You know what? To make room in my budget, I'll eat out less for this game. I will eat some basic-ass sandwiches for a couple days just to pick up the next pack.

I get mad at this game. I get mad at this game the same way I get mad at, say, Rocket League or Overwatch. When I get a run of bad luck in this game, it feels like something is actively working against me. Like something hates me and wants me to fail. When I get exactly the card or token I needed to win, I feel overwhelming relief. The highs are high and the lows are low. I get emotionally involved. I don't feel like that when I play most games.

Arkham Horror makes me feel things.

RATING: 7
It has all the upsides of LCG's, with the challenge and satisfaction they all provide of building a deck that works. It has more thematic narrative upside with linked scenarios providing a campaign feel (although I'd prefer to see even more linkage). 

By way of disclosure, I was involved in early playtesting and assisted with card and rules editing (though they did change further after I’d finished).

I’ve played AH and EH, to which this is thematically linked, but my comparative point of view is more towards other LCG’s as this is the framework from which the game was built. Some will be attracted to the game by the theme despite not being card-heads, others because they love the rich depth and extensive replay that the LCG deck-building world provides, where an Arkham based co-op fits their idea of a fun space to explore. To that end, I have some form, having been a playtester and editor for Star Wars LCG and Warhammer Conquest LCG, and played 500+ games of LotR LCG, which is similarly co-op. 

The deckbuilding is limited with just the core set (as is always the case with LCG’s until you invest in expansion packs), but it gives you enough to tinker with and a few ways to play so as to earn the value of each type of card. As you progress through each scenario, you earn XP and spend them to swap out a card for either a stronger version of that card (typically), or maybe a different stronger card. If you think of your deck as representing your character, then this represents levelling up your character. (In practice, this campaign style is not dissimilar to how we do our LotR campaigns, keeping the same heroes and restricting ourselves to a limited number of deck changes each scenario. It’s just that it’s a forced structure here.)

In terms of gameplay, the aim of the game is spend as many investigate actions as you can to gather clues - getting the requisite number of clues enables the win. The game then throws as many obstacles in the way to limit your opportunities to do so, be it by introducing monsters that need fighting, forcing you to move to different locations for new sources of clues, giving you “weakness” troubles that require actions to clear, and so on. I’ll confess I wasn’t a big fan of the mathy nature of this structure - each turn I ended up reducing the results of the “introduce badness” phase to how many required actions were just added to the quest. But this structure does provide the necessary fuel around the deck-build - what percentage of the deck will you use to help with clue-gathering, what percentage to fighting monsters and clearing the way, etc.

The other element that ended up turning me away from the game was the calculable nature of resolving any task. All tasks - like investigate a clue, or fighting a monster - require you to reach a given target number using icons on your cards. After you’ve determined how many icons to commit, you draw a chit from the bag that adjusts the target number. The bag is a fixed and known quantity with every draw. So by way of example, I currently have in play the same number of icons as the target number. My chances of success might be 3 in 16. If I throw a card from my hand to add 1 more icon, it increases to 7 in 16 say. Throw in another card with an icon and I’m up to 10 in 16. And so on. Every decision is a calculable risk / reward equation. And when you throw enough in to get a 14 in 16 must--win shot and still lose, it’s not the only thing that gets thrown around the table!! 

This mathy-nature led me to losing thematic immersion and was where the game lost its magic for me. I much prefer the non-calculable nature of LotR. But it’s exactly why this game has taken a different approach - it offers a different feel that will appeal to a different set of gamers, hopefully broadening the LCG player base and limiting the cannibalisation of the LotR player base. 

Having said all that, I’m a fan of the LCG genre as it inherently generates interesting and hard decision making both pre and during games, and this iteration is no different. So even though it’s not my preferred taste, I’ll still enjoy it if it hits the table. I know from past LCG experience that the game will broaden and deepen, and the playing experience will grow richer. Combine that with a wildly attractive theme, and I’m sure the game will prove rewarding for those it appeals to and who invest ongoing.

Great that the artwork isn't as recycled as it is for much of the FFG Cthulhu output.
Does not do as good a job of creating a narrative as it could. If each act and stage had more parts that would help.
Although FFG have obviously put lots of effort into the rules, they still suck. There are loads of parts where after a few games I still have no idea what to do or how to use certain cards and assets.
As with most of the recent FFG games, I find the rules overly and unnecessarily complicated. What i mean is that the many fiddly smaller rules just make the game harder to play, breaking the spell and not actually adding any depth (as Nate also did with the LOTR LCG).

4 tries to get through The Gathering. And it got better as I went along but I still spent too long looking for lost rules!

Solo rules are excellent - just a coop run played by as many characters/hands as you want.

Experience was excellent too.

Score downgraded. Some of the individual scenario rules are extremely poorly laid out. You have to play them, reveal spoilers, go to the forums etc. to figure them out. At the prices we pay, you'd think they could get this sorted.
Blood on the Altar
Undimensioned and Unseen totally unclear.
In fact the rules are so poor and annoying that I will probably just finish Carcosa and walk away from this series.

I'll update this more once I have a few more plays under my belt and maybe once I start to play around with the deck building aspect. It basically took Lord of the Rings LCG and cleaned up the few issues I had with it. It's much more story based and I really like the dark theme. I was rather impressed with my first play of it though.

I've come to hate the rulebooks that FFG provides now. I don't like partially learning a game and than having to consult a more thorough rulebook while I'm playing the game. Yes, it's much easier to find answers to questions you have, but I seem to have a lot of questions my first game and it only ever arises because of this new rulebook system. I realize their old rulebooks were not the best organized and a bit verbose at times, but at least you knew how to play the game fully before a question or side case arises.

This game does not have much common with the board game of same name besides theme. No similar mechanics here. Nevertheless its a very good game and while the card mechanics are in the spotlight here instead of adventure feel it still feels quite thematic and has really good artwork which is thankfully almost all new and not reused from previous FFG games. I like the campaign system of deck building - you can build new cards to your deck based on experience gathered.

We love this game, as we are great fans of the theme, co-ops and deckbuilders. The only reasons for not giving this a ten is that the basic box contains a campaign of just 3 scenarios and the deckbuilding option is severly limited with just one core set.

Played a 4-player scenario of Rou-ga-roux and failed miserably. I enjoyed it a lot. The two experienced players at our table took us through the rules and I found the game quite accessible. But they didn't spoil the experience for me by suggesting how to play, letting me figure it out myself. 
This allowed me to make my own choices, some of which were not too good. Like I said, we failed. But I enjoyed the mechanics of the game, the pressure it puts on you (life in Arkham is hard!) and what I enjoyed most is that this is a coop in which every played can do his own thing and still be part of a team. 
The game has a definite role-playing feel which I also like. 

I'm not into solo-games and probably will not purchase it. But if solo is your thing, this game is for you (if you can handle failure..). If my friends aks me over for another round, I'll gladly accept. 

One of us got eliminated early in the game. He wasn't too keen to play again. Just a warning.

A faster and lighter version of Mansions of Madness where the cards represent locations on the board.

RATING: 10
Have played it through the first campaign solo. Easily one of the best solo gaming experiences I've had so far. The theme is spot on, it plays incredibly well, and has tons of room for character building/deck customization and diverging strategies. I never felt like I needed to play it two-handed, although the feeling of being "alone" was there, and was often wishing I had more characters to help...that's a win for me.

Will definitely be playing with other characters and going through different story options.

Can't wait to play it with my full group once we get everyone together.

Fantastic LCG.  I love the entire model of LCG's and this newest one by FFG really hit it out of the park for me.  After plating Game of Thrones and Lord of the Rings LCGs this felt like something different. I love to solo game and I enjoyed the theme and story that is quite rich.  Always feel like I need to complete just one more scenario to see what will happen to my investigators.  Difficulty is easily manipulated with the chaos bag but even then, bad pulls from encounter deck or the chaos bag itself can still hurt badly. Great game.

I really like this game, I just wish that I got a chance to play it more. I've been collecting the expansions religiously, but it can be hard to get people together for a regular game night for an ongoing campaign-structured game with so many other games out there.

Rating should improve when I get past this hurdle.

RATING: 8
Definitely feels limited with just the base box; my wife and I were surprised that we were restricted to certain pairs of characters since some of their suggested "basic decks" are mutually exclusive if you only have one set of cards. You'll need a full second set if you want to go to 3 or 4 players as well.

That said, I really enjoy my time with this game. The theme feels spot-on; it may not be the true existential horror of Lovecraft, but the sense of oncoming dread that the Doom Counter mechanic provides in its various forms fits the bill quite nicely. It's also fitting that campaign takes into account varying degrees of success and failure for each scenario; victory and mastery aren't necessary for progress, and that's absolutely welcome in a horror-themed game.

There's definitely a learning curve with plenty of rules references for your first round or two, but we were able to pick it up fairly quickly and on-the-fly. It doesn't grind to a halt if you fudge a rule here or there while you get your bearings. 

I wouldn't begin to understand how to meaningfully optimize deckbuilding, but to me that's a selling point; I can craft a deck from a sense of story and character instead of number-crunching.

RATING: 7
A little disappointed with this game so far.  It's got some things in common with LotR: Card Game, but on the other hand I hate the drawing tokens out of the bag.  You can just pull the really crappy tokens out of the bag over and over again and it just ends up taking all of the fun out of it.

Things I do like comparing it to LotR is that I like the fact that the locations on the board aren't pulled at random and are actual destinations on the board.  The locations that are linked together and how they work is really nice and I wish that got ported over to LotR.

I really feel like I'd rather play Eldritch Horror or Elder Sign over this if I want a Cthulhu game.  If I want a good solo/2-player co-op game I think I'd rather play LotR.  The funny thing is I think this game is still easier than LotR in a lot of ways.

Good for experienced FFG LCG fans, but people new to that scene will find the deck construction and setup very frustrating.  Requires a surprisingly large table space.  The difficult and time consuming setup combined with the very high difficulty will turn away anyone who hasn't played FFG LCGs or other Akham-verse FFG titles before.  I appreciate what they're trying to do with the chaos bag, on a purely tactile level, it's extremely unsatisfying.

Veterans of LotR LCG, Eldritch Horror, or Elder Sign will love this.

Played through the first scenario last night with husband. It was a little rough, we made some mistakes, but holy hell is this FUN. And there is so much potential! I absolutely cannot wait to play more scenarios, more expansions, and also replay the scenarios with different investigators and different players/player counts. The replayability was something I was worried about, but it's definitely there. Totally worth it, and totally hooked.

Nach dem ersten Szenario dachte ich: "Tolles Spiel, macht Spaß, fesselt mich aber nicht sooo sehr." Wie sehr ich mich doch geirrt habe. Dieses Spiel macht süchtig! Man möchte mit anderen Charakteren und anderen Decks die anderen Schwierigkeitsgrade ausprobieren und vor allem die neuen Geschichten entdecken. Grandioses Spiel mit fesselnder Thematik. Aber wieso ist kein Beutel dabei?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Setup is slightly more tedious to LotR LCG. There is more story aka flavour text in this game. 

The chaos tokens bag presents another "probability management" problem for skill checks.

However, each player can choose their character and deck before the first game to determine which skill checks they are better at. There is also a survivor/generalist class which can cope better with chaos tokens and failed skill checks.

Each character deck has their own unique weakness card and a random basic weakness card which follows them throughout the campaign. 

There are certain points of the game where you may need to make decisions which may affect you or your team either during the scenario only or even throughout the whole campaign.

This is an excellent cooperative game, and a fun deck construction game. Currently there are not many packs out which makes the strategy around building and choosing your deck a bit lame, and that is something I'm quite interested in playing around with, so that is holding this back from moving up my rankings. 

Else the actual gameplay is great. I love the use of the locations compared to LotR. In fact, I really do think the actual gameplay surpasses LotR for me, even though I rate LotR higher. I suspect it is partially because LotR LCG has so many more cards available to actually get to play around with the customization aspect more, and I slightly prefer that theme. 

Still in time, I suspect this will move up to a 9 once the card pool expands and they start exploring the game system more and more with unique quests.

Won't buy into the expansions for sure.

The stories told in this story telling game aren't very thoughtful or interesting, and the sheer amount of luck involved in skill checks and card draws frequently transcend push-your-luck to become absurdly arbitrary.

Quietly excited at the potential of this game. I have high hopes that this will stand above Elder sign as one of our favorite Lovecraft themed games.
Update: played a few rounds and seems quite light and straight forward. Just the starter campaign for now but will be interested to see if this has some more depth. Card abilities and uses might be a little bit lackluster. But I'm hoping its just the campaign we are playing that's just not giving us enough to get our teeth into. Maybe once we get familiar with the assets,events and skills we might see something worth replaying.

RATING: 10
Long I've been awaiting for a game like this. First of all, I love LCGs, CCGs and the like; secondly, I'm a Mythos junkie - enjoy EH, Elder Sign and some others. Arkham Horror LCG marries both in a game that plays incredibly well solo. 

It's very thematic and replayable (even though some of the narrative surprises wear off after a game or two), it's also tense, especially with just one investigator. The classes are done incredibly well, each of them plays differently, making the game a completely new puzzle when you change the investigator. Deck building is fun and not too taxing, the experience mechanic gives a fine RPG feel. The scenarios are different, each feels unique, and the storytelling is great (way above LotR LCG). 

If you look for a game you can play solo in ~45 minutes (kids, lack of time or gaming partners) this is the way to go. Try it, especially if you enjoy Cthulhu games. For me it's a 10, a game I will play for many years to come.

My (hopefully) very last foray into the realm of LCGs. 
I have mixed emotions regarding this game.
It is a fantastic system and the LCG formula gives it a constantly changing / evolving milieu, while financially it remains still affordable. 
But it asks so much from the player: It is a life-style game instead of a game what you can play just occasionally. To fully comprehend its greatness you have to deepdive into deckbuilding, and that requires a lot of time: to construct / test / finetune / play these decks is a serious time commitment, and in my opinion this is the only right way to play these kind of games. If you are commited enough (and if you have the time it requires) this is a deep and satisfying experience. If you don't, then the experience is shallow and only an imitation of the real thing....
So even knowing, that the campaign play is wonderfully realized, that the chaos bag is a fantastic, and that the different investigators and classes each grant a unique playing experience, a bid farewell to this game. It is a 10, but a 10 which I will sell with a broken heart. :(

RATING: 4
I am completely mystified by how well-liked this game is.

After about eight hours of gameplay, it seems like a random, fiddly mess.

It suffers from the same problems as most other so-called Cthulhu/Lovecraft games i.e. decisions are reactive and painfully simple - or would be, but for the distracting  hubbub of ever-changing modifiers, rules exceptions and text.

The only way to 'not play well' is to mis-remember all the different rules that might hurt you.

People say it "tells stories" and even that it has a "roleplaying game" element. Huh? Events are mostly random and usually completely unconnected.

Don't believe the hype about it being a deck-building game, as that element is almost non-existent. You're basically just taking a load of random cards and throwing them together to see if you win.

The cost of expansions is crazy.

I'll play it only because my chum Jon happens to make it fun enough.

Also, have board game writers ever read any H P Lovecraft? His books - and even the slightly sillier writers who followed him - feel nothing like these board games. Instead, the imagery/themes/characters in these board games feel like they should be in a violent first-person-shooter computer game incarnation of Indiana Jones.

The best Cthulhu/Lovecraft game I've played continues to be the first edition of A Study In Emerald (which is different to the second edition). Even that game is a bonkers mess (with a lot of errata too), but there's a lot more to do, a lot less rules to check and more exciting endings.

Greatly enjoy this game!  Very immersive and thematic. Deeply engrossing. And while there is a bit of learning curve, I felt that I had the rules pretty solid by the end of the second scenario.  Looking forward to more content!

[b]Pros:[/b]
- Very thematic!!
- The rulebook is surprisingly well organized. 
- Decently easy to get started as a new player to the genre The game does a good job of providing you with a recommended starter setup without needing any prior deck building knowledge or experience. 
- I like the deck building methods. You can do as little (using the points you get as you progress) or as much (build it from scratch) as you prefer. 
- The 'grim rule' makes it easier to deal with situations where you are not sure how to apply the rules. Helps reduce stalls when a a rules question comes up during play. 
- New content will be available on a semi-regular basis to keep adding new stories, characters, and cards. 
- Great art! 
- The Chaos tokens are a cool way of applying unexpected modifiers. Adds some randomness to your checks in the game and adds suspense. Also makes the game easily adjustable in difficulty. 
-  Adjustable difficulty. 
- Scales decently for 1 up to 4. 
- Enjoyable regardless of player count. 

[b]Cons:[/b]
- Lots of rules and terms to learn. The rulebook makes these really easy to look up but if you're not a fan of lots of rules beware. 
- Will get expensive - as an LCG there will be constantly new expansions and it can get pricy if you want them all. 
- If you want to play with more than 1 or 2 players, you MUST get more than one copy of the game. 
- The bag/cup you need for the Chaos tokens doesn't come with the game. This can be a nuisance for some people. 
- The box is too small!!!  After sleeving I can barely fit 2 core sets in one box. 
- A third party insert is practically necessary because without one setup is quite beastly.
- Set up can be time consuming so if that bothers you beware.

This game is perhaps everything I wanted The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game to be. I'm a fan of the Arkham Horror setting, though the only other AH games I own is the FFG version of AH with some expansions. 

The art of course is perfect and fits with the art of the boardgame. Aesthetically it's a very attractive package.

While I own most of the expansions currently out, I've only played the core campaign, though I've used investigators and player cards from expansion. I recommend giving the core campaign a try and then if you enjoy it, going in on the expansions. There's definitely game to enjoy in the core set, but the limiting factor to me is not the three scenario campaign, but the limited pool of player cards. I have not successfully completed to core campaign, but with the increased player cards and investigator pool from the expansions I think there is great replayability with just the short core campaign.

Will come back to this later, but I love the investigator development and customization.

 Really addictive card game. It's a shame that there are so few options for cards to pick in the core.

After almost a year with the game (and 10 expansions :D), I still play it very often. There many options in the construction of your deck and there many chaacterss to choose, so the replayability is on the upper level.

Absolutely fantastic as a two player game. I love the theme and the way that all the scenarios play out differently. This game also has some of the most unique card game design I've seen - FFG is really willing to push the envelope with card effects.

The way the scenarios form an interlocking campaign is amazing as well. I love that decisions made earlier in the campaign will affect future games!

RATING: 9
Love the campaign and the feeling of dread, but I feel this game lives and dies by the deck-building. I enjoyed it a lot more once I got a second core for more options and a binder for organisation. But now that I put more in to my character, I got more upset when I pull bad cards or chaos tokens and ruin my campaign prematurely. It almost feels like you need to know all the act, agenda, and encounter cards in order to craft an effective deck -- I guess that's not bad, but it feels a little bit like gaming the system, and breaks my narrative immersion somewhat.

I'm yet to determine whether the (significant) time and effort I put in to crafting my deck and playing the game is ultimately rewarded by the game systems. So far, it has for the most part.

First  impressions - interesting blend of LOTR, Pathfinder and Warhammer ACG with some cards and the in-game economy kinda reminiscent of Netrunner. 

Deck building being part of the campaign game is the real selling-point  - the game's strength is that this makes for a strong experience and sense of character and investment - the draw back is the more limited replay  and what inevitably ends up looser as deck-construction  - more about the experience than the strict technical skill involved in play. Liked it a lot, but don't think I'm ready for the investment. Also, after Call of Cthulhu RPG, Arkham Horror, Elder Sign, Mansions of Madness 2, maybe I've seen enough of the theme and these same  protagonists (though i do have an urge to see a Harvey Walters deck). I think I'd like to see this system fitted to a generic fantasy background (or who knows, maybe a non-cyberpunk non-40k SF setting) that allows for endless grinding of quests to keep changing up your deck - though such a design might almost be self-sustaining without need for endless expansions, so I don't expect one anytime soon. AHTCG is really a better game, but (so far!) I think I prefer Pathfinder ACG for campaign and LOTR LCG for the challenge - undoubtedly though this game manages to blend the two elements to achieve something unique from its predecessors. Do really like the art deco-ish card backs, welcome change from the usual loud and messy FFG designs - it's a slick product.

I have no idea why everyone loves this game. It took forever to learn. Easily four hours. And when playing the game I constantly had to refer to the rule book, which hindered any chance at enjoyment. And it had been said this was a deck builder but there's only a few cards to swap out, so any deck building is minuscule. It could see how t has potential but it's not worth the tiring investment to fully learn the ropes to play with ease and fun.

Love it. The story explanation trough the events and cards it's excellent, I find hard to believe that with just a few cards it is able to make you feel like you are exploring Arkham. It's true that for each scenario the best playtrough it's the first one, but i feel they are very replayable.

The gameplay itself it's also very good, the combination of different characters and classes offers lots of different strategies to beat the scenarios. The only problem it has is the limited options if you only own the core game, you'll have to buy the expansions to make the most of it.

This is an extremely balanced game, go on hard and you'll be sitting round the table with a high pulse and sweat pouring throughout the game. The core set scenarios are very good (haven't played any others, yet) but you'll have a great time. 2-4 hours/scenario for us, but we discuss EVERY move possible. One of the best games I've played (btw, it's a perk to be the lead investigator).

RATING: 10
Edit: After about 50 plays, I've decided to give this game the elusive "10." It's a wonderful game, and I've put more time in to this than most other games/systems. 
I can see myself playing this multiple times a week (or at minimum 1x/week) for the foreseeable future. I cannot say that about any other game, despite how much I enjoy them.  Weird thing is, there are other games I enjoy more and rate lower, but none where I can expect to play it with such consistency. Partly this is because my wife and friends enjoy this game so much that I actually have two outlets in which to play this. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Original comments, amended with time:
There's a lot that I like here. It's certainly the most interesting of the Arkham Files games, with the largest decision space. The designers have been incredibly creative with scenario building. I have been utterly impressed with the diversity of everything released thus far. Edit after completing DL: This continues to be true, the scenarios remain impressive. 

It's basically a card-driven board game made exclusively of cards- the location cards create a highly malleable setting to explore. 

The deckbuilding is highly approachable and fun. To start, you don't even have the entire card pool to choose from, which makes getting started very easy. The game really opens up over the scenarios.

I love card games, and this one doesn't disappoint. The hand management if fun and feels fresh. 

The game is immersive. And this is someone who doesn't generally care about theme. The pressure is high, and doesn't release. 

My least favorite aspect of the game is the ability to jump around scenarios. Like, if I am playing a scenario with my wife, and then wish to play with my friends, I frequently have to deconstruct my decks in order to make that happen. I suspect that this will be more and more of a minor issue as the card pool expands. Edit after 50 plays: THIS IS STILL MY BIGGEST GRIPE! I have been playing 2 campaigns simultaneously, and I have to share cards between decks. This has not been a deterrent to me, just an annoyance. 

This is easily my favorite couple's game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I lowered my rating a bit to account more for the tired theme, especially since if I want to play any other eldritch game I lose all desire to play this game for a bit because I'm never in the mood for that much of the same theme. Some of the cards in the expansions can be pretty uninspired, but most of the stories make up for it. This still probably makes my top 5 list. 

This game used to be the only game I would play every time without turning down. Kingdom Death took that spot.

2 sets is almost a must. After that, very good game. The  deckbuilding aspect feels like leveling a character in a RPG. The mandatory weakness cards, as well as the chance to autofail rolls, may seem like a nuisance, but its there to make sure you can never mix-max a scenario, as well as know that this journey is not a normal RPG game where you character becomes a demi-god at the end, but has the scars and lessons from conflict. There is a feeling of real tension is this game I haven't felt in a while in co-op games, there will be many soul-crushing last turn defeats and victories from the jaws of defeat moments. Brilliant game if you give it a chance, creates a bad first impression because of playing with 1 set and the mediocre built in decks.

Best with 2 players in my opinion.

If LOTR and WQ had a baby... This game adds to the narrative experience and makes exploration fun. While I liked elements of LOTR and WQ I sold both after only a couple of plays each. LOTR felt like an exercise in planning/ going on the Internet and copying other people's tweaked decks (no thanks). WQ was more exciting and felt like a dungeon crawl with no exciting geographical exploration - enemies came from shadows and attached themselves to your characters, it was very abstract.

AH LCG marries the deck building and exciting encounters of these games and vastly improves the way your characters exist in space. you're not floating around somewhere foggy waiting to be attacked, you're deciding to go to the attic to explore and you can only go to the attic from the hallway. You narrowly slipped past the monster that just engaged you (using hand management and push your luck depending on just how important the task at hand is) to find clue in the attic but now you must make your way to the hallway to continue the adventure. When in the hallway you trigger the next part of the narrative which makes sense as you're tied to a location.

The game is very streamlined and the mechanics make perfect sense. The game involves a narrative I care about because the locations aren't abstract - I'm in the lobby because I chose to go there and now a monster is chasing me between the rooms and the card I'm working towards hints at what I must do to get away but oh no something else happened and Ahhhh the cards I just used I should have saved now I need to make a really important skill test. Speaking of skill tests I wanted to like eldritch horror but couldn't get into it as it was more like roller coaster journey on rails than a game with tough decisions.

An excellent evolution it improves both LOTR and WQ while offering meaningful narrative often found in games like eldritch horror yet makes sense while using cards. What an achievement! The card game I've been waiting for!

Once in a while comes a fantastic game. This, is one. Brilliant system that was already put to the test elsewhere, and it works like magic here. Scenarios and extensions keep rolling, and I just hope that quality follows quantity, and, most importantly, that the game stays as hard as it is right now... It's quite rare that a Lovecraftian game is true to the author's universe and makes you feel helpless, on the edge. As it is, the game forces you to make the right decisions if only to survive until the next turn, rethink your strategy, forge a better deck, instead of becoming, by forgiving poor or sketchy play, the dice fest that its parent game was.

Superb.

Arkham Horror: The Card Game is the most fun I've had playing a card game solitaire. Takes a little bit of a learning curve to get it down, but the mechanics are solid, the artwork and overall production value is high, and you can't find better lore than H.P. Lovecraft. I highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a boardgame you can play by yourself. You can play with another person (or more people if you get a second set but it's a little difficult to get someone else adjusted to the rules right off the bat, especially if they're casual or new to gaming. But once you learn the game, it's so much fun.

RATING: 9
My rating is based on the first play of the game.  I enjoyed this game and like how the story moved forward based on the cards.  There were a few times were there has to be some acceptance of illogical things - such as  searching for clues - I mean, what exactly were we looking for?  Or where did that beat cop suddenly show up from? But if you can overlook the abstractness of some of the mechanic, the game was very interesting and one I would definitely play again.

One thing I do have to say, however, is I am once again very upset with FFs marketing mechanic of needing more than one set to play with more than two people.  I am pretty fed up with the way they do this with all their games, which ends up with lots of wasted cards and tokens.  But I guess people keep buying it, so hoping for change is pointless.  But this is a reason that I would never buy this one for myself. But this did cause the game to drop down at least half a point in my rating.

Fun, but an expensive investment for it to truly be everything it can be.  The base game provides a great experience, but it feels like you've just waded into the first step of the pool.  Looking ahead, you know there's a lot of good stuff waiting for you, but it just costs so much to keep up with the game.

This game probably sits at more of an objective 7 but I'm a fan of the Cthulhu mythos so it sits at an 8 for me. I enjoy co-op games and I was looking for a good solo game when this one hit the market. The obvious down side is a lack of significant replay ability do to the game design but they have accounted for this and are producing scenario expansions regularly (at least for now). The game difficulty and how it changes is both unique and excellent! And OOOOH! does it get hard as &$@#! If you enjoyed the LotR LCG or Arkham or Eldrich horror, this is a no brain-er.

Early impressions (after 2 missions) are very positive.  I had a ton of fun with this, and I can't wait to play the rest of the campaign.  The mechanics work and don't create a ton of downtime, the decisions are reasonably interesting, and the theme shines through the gameplay.  I liked Lord of the Rings LCG a lot too, so if that's not your cup of tea, I'm not sure this would be either.

Update after finishing core campaign and The Dunwich Legacy:  Rating goes up to an 8.5.

Ugh, so disappointed by this game. With one copy of the base game alone, using the suggested difficulty (Standard) and two of the suggested decks (Wendy and the other guy), it is almost impossible to beat the game. We were able to beat the first mission easily enough but the second mission was near impossible as we were only able to apprehend one cultist.

Checking the *FFG* forums (as opposed to the BGG forums) it turns out you really need two copies of the base game to double up on the powerful cards. That's complete bullshit IMHO. I'm not buying another copy of the game so I can get extra copies of 1/4-1/3 of the contents of the box. That's wasteful and FFG is dishonest with this.

Probably my biggest disappointment about this "card game" is that deckbuilding is almost a non-issue as you have very, very few options for your deck out of the box, and even upgrading cards between missions is only a choice between two or three options. And when the game plays, it's not like playing a card game, it's just a board game made out of cards.

Yeah, I know if I buy another copy and then Dunwich I'll have all kinds of deckbuilding options but that's not worth the money.

RATING: 10
This game is fantastic, the mechanics are simple which makes it easy to learn, yet the gameplay itself is so thematic, every action you take makes you feel like you are short on time and often like you are facing something you will be lucky to survive.  the chaos bag is brilliant IMO at least because it allows you to change it depending on how difficult you wish the game to be and it also can change based on choices you make playing the game, In addition the feeling you encounter when you reach into the bag hoping that you pull what you need but knowing you may not, gives the game that edge of your seat feeling and puts you closer to being in the game as opposed to playing it.  Sure some people may not like the randomness of it, but that is part of the theme, that to even survive will not only require strong constitution and will but an exceeding amount of luck as well.  I will be playing this game as often as I can.

I had pretty much sworn off LCG's, but my Secret Santa scored this game for me for Xmas. Finally got around to playing it co-op months later with a buddy and... it's excellent! Very well designed and integrated, and it makes logical sense (in a Lovecraftian-thematic way).

There was more fighting than I anticipated, but that's OK. An expanded index (the current index is missing too many terms) would have really helped.

Easy to see why this game is such a big hit; excellent story-telling/RPG elements in an accessible LCG design. The artwork is very good.

OK,I'm hooked and will definitely be purchasing future expansions! Great series, we are having so much fun with it...

I bought two copies of the core set, so we can play with three to four people. Love the game play of this very much with the twists and turns it throws at you with the encounter deck, that you build with each scenario. Plus the card building aspect is something I've always wanted to try, but never got round to it.
Downloaded several scenarios to add to the Base game (29/10/17)
Our group is playing this to death, but loving every horror filled moment, and it’s hitting the table more than any other game that we have in our collection. (10/12/17)

Update: Bumped back up to 9, with the first cycle complete and two Print on Demand scenarios released you now have enough content to last through at least a month of after work game nights. It's the most popular game within my group at this time.

Update: Reduced rating as while the mechanics and theme are good there's currently (core only) not enough content here to warrant tons of replaying. Due to the narrative driven co-op nature there absolutely needs to be an amount of material released that can't be finished in an afternoon. The game isn't at that point yet and likely won't be until this point next year (Nov 2017) when the first cycle of expansions has been completed.

It's everything I wanted the LoTR LCG to be and more. Nails the theme, simple mechanics that work really well. This box alone is a complete package but the potential for the game is huge.

I've really enjoyed Arkham for quite sometime now.  The game is complicated, but I found the rules easy to understand.  Much like any genre of game, the more you've played, the easier the concepts are to grasp.

The story is quite interesting, and while the first play is always the best, the different investigators and deck building options make it fun to play the story again with a different style of deck.

Gone are the dice and the flavoursome descriptions of the parent game. In are scenario cards that try to create the narrative and the RPG expereince.

This not for me an rpg expereince because laying out the cards and stacking the story decks tells me too much about what is to come. The characters are okay but as is the trend now your trusty sidearm is in your deck and you have to find it, play it and pay for it before you can start shooting cultists. Meanwhile your Fed agent has a knife and a stick of dynamite. This is screaming that i have missed a rule on starting items, but we checked.

The chaos bag is an x-sided die that allows varying levels of difficulty. I like dice. I dont like chits when there is suspense needed. But a custom d13 range of results is not an easy ask. The irony here is that no bag is supplied. Spent some time searching for an opaque container. 

Given the similarity to Mansions of Madness, one starts looking for the missing app....

It's okay. Where Eldritch Horror is at a higher level than Arkham Horror, this is lower and card based. Basically Countries-Towns-Rooms are your denominations.

Tried the game a few times solo. Not ready to give up on it yet, but I’m not having as much fun as I thought I would.  

First, there is the hate it or love it Learn to play/Reference rulebook that FFG has adopted, I hate it. I don’t enjoy learning a game this way at all. At it makes reading the rulebook a chore.

Then there is the usual FFG bloat.  For example, there are 20 steps in the round sequence. I found myself having to constantly refer to the two rulebooks to remember the exact details of each step. 

Also, strangely for this type of card game, you could actually play a whole game without playing a single card from your hand. It might not be a good strategy, but it’s entirely possible. It plays more like a boardgame that a card game. 

Everything you do is based on a skill check, and the cards help mitigate the luck. That’s the game. Want to fight? Combat skill + number of icons played - dice rolled (chaos token bag) vs target number. Want to evade? Same thing but with the agility skill. Want to find a clue? Same thing again, different skill.  Etc, etc.

What you are actually trying to do is not that exciting either. Basically as a team you want to gather clue tokens and spend them on the act deck so the story moves forward. And the game throws obstacle at you to hinder you on your fetch quest.  So what you will actually do is reveal a room, place the required number of clue tokens on it, then take investigate actions, with the associated skill check to try and collect those clue. And that’s it. Once you have enough clues, you spend them, read the next bit of story, then start the process all over again. 

The story telling system for this game is great. The agenda and act cards contribute to immerse yourself in the story, as does the campaign guide and the location flipping mechanism. However, the actual gameplay falls a bit flat for me. It kinds of remind me of Descent 2nd edition. Equip items and assets in different slots, then move around the board searching for clues and fighting.

So, it’s a strange game that doesn’t seem to know what it wants to be.

Despite having only played a few games, I really believe that this will become my top LCG because of the narrative generated by the game and the fact that I'm playing it with longtime friends. The choices between different scenarios, the asymmetry of the different characters, the proliferation of p&p scenarios and campaigns warrants this one a place in my shelves. Will probably go up from the starting 8.5 I've rated it as the game evolves, hopefully for the best.

altamente tematico, le meccaniche sono raffinate e ben amalgamate, i turni di gioco procedono elegantemente e l'esperienza che ne deriva è completa ed appagante. un mazzo di carte è riuscito a contenere un grande gioco, con un livello narrativo da brividi sulla schiena. Un gioco affascinante, profondo ma semplice da giocare. Gli scenari del base sono WOW e i personaggi con i rispettivi deck funzionano alla perfezione, si sente il senso evoluzione del personaggio. Non vedo l'ora di giocare nuovi scenari e non posso far altro che sperare che ne escano sempre di nuovi.

I am a huge fan of [thing=77423][/thing] and it is one of my most played games.  I love deck construction and I love cooperative games.  While Lord of the Rings is one of my favorite games, I am neutral-positive about the Lovecraft theme, so I was very excited to try out [thing=205637][/thing].

You can see how much the designers have learned from 5 years of developing LotR.  Some of the clunky mechanics from LotR have been streamlined, and some of the best ideas have been highlighted.  

One of the main differences is that Arkham incorporates campaign play into its very essence.  This is mostly a positive because I like campaign play, but I also see this as somewhat of a negative because it is harder to just get together with friends and play a scenario.

The other main difference is that Arkham is more story-focused while LotR is more mechanics-focused.  As someone that has more of a mechanical mind, I think LotR will remain my favorite of the two.  However, I do enjoy the story.  My favorite aspect is that your campaign can continue even if you lose a scenario, and there are multiple resolutions to the scenarios instead of just win/lose.

Arkham Horror is exploring some exciting new design spaces that haven't been attempted before in a customizable card game, and I'm really looking forward to how it plays out.

RATING: 8.5
The randomness is sometimes a bit annoying but encourages more play, and further plays allow you to mitigate that randomness with knowledge and planning. But the 'discovery' aspect of this game is amazing and compelling. It's damn hard, like most good co-ops, and well received here also. There is no forgiving bad management and relying on luck seems to hurt you more than help you, but the challenge is engaging. The theme fits well with the gameplay also. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Even if I have to buy a lot of expansions to get replayability out of this one, gameplay-wise and thematically it totally lives up to it's hype. Sure, it can be frustrating and is full of randomness; for me, this helps for a good narrative and allows for those satisfying "I finally made it!!"-moments. 

I can't recommended it enough IF you are willing to dive into the LCG - there is just not enough replayability in the core game alone, especially if you only buy one copy.

EDIT: For some weeks, corresponding to a time I mostly solo-ed this one, I had a time where I either played this game or thought about new builds or strategies. It left me sleepless! SLEEPLESS! I never had that feeling with any other boardgames apart from Twilight Struggle.

I told to myself no more collectible games and yet here I am writing a comment for LCG. I really liked the Lord of the Rings LCG and me and my group have a great times with the game. But need for building basically a completely new deck for every adventure was not fun for everyone and as game grows the time of constructing decks took more of our lives than actually playing the game. So we sold it.

I was afraid Arkham Horror will be the same but it surprised me in a good way. It combines a light elements of RPG by evolving deck instead of rebuilding it. Also it covers a right amount of lovecraftian atmosphere and combining it with the fun of LotR LCG. I'm intrigued and if the game keeps to be this good it will take us some time before (if) we let it go.

RATING: 10
This was my most anticipated game in a long time. I've played every LCG (except, ironically, Call of Cthulhu). I love the Lord of the Rings LCG, which is similar to this game. So I had really high hopes for this one.

So far, it's great.

Controlling just one character (in LotR you control 2 or 3) as you make your way around Arkham, the depth of the scenarios, and having true campaign play are great. I've only played the first two scenarios from the core box (multiple times), but they show quite a bit of variety and they each have a whole different feel.

I was worried that this game would be too similar to LotR because of the similar mechanisms, but it really has a completely different feel. LotR has a really free form structure where you can play cards and take actions all throughout the round, but Arkham LCG feels more like a co-op board game where you take your turns with your three actions, then the game takes a turn, and repeat.

The economy of the game surprisingly feels more similar to Android: Netrunner. In both games you can spend actions to draw cards or get resources/credits, so you always feel like you're working up to something and trying to get the most out of every action.

There's been a lot of debate about one core set versus two, but you definitely need two core sets per player unless you just want to try out the game. The starter decks are really unreliable where you essentially have 30 unique cards, and getting the right pieces in play is completely up to the luck of the draw. With two core sets you put two copies of each important card, increasing the odds of drawing it and having a backup in case a game effect makes you lose it. Also, with two cores, two players can have two complete decks ready to go as long as they pick investigators of different factions (and sub-factions). 

The smaller decks and the limit of two copies per card mean that I'll be able to put more effort into deckbuilding with this game. As much as I love the other LCG's, I often just end up using decklists found online since I don't play enough to keep up with all of the new cards and deck archetypes. With smaller decks I can really go through all of the cards and see how everything interacts.

Update: I've now played through the entire campaign three times (twice with two players, once with three players) and it is fantastic. I've used all of the characters (except for Agnes) with decks that I've built, and I just love playing the game. So far the solo game is not so great, at least until we get more deckbuilding options. But with two and three players it's great.

I have to say they really nailed it with the first scenario. When you know what you're doing, you can beat it in 20-30 minutes so it serves as a great short intro to the game. More importantly, though, it's great for testing out new decks. Play a few rounds, make sure you can easily take care of the smaller enemies and have some way to deal with the larger ones, then you get to see how your deck can handle the boss. All in about 20 minutes. Great stuff.

[b]Player Count Verdict: 2-3[/b]
Here in the early life of the game, it's not very good solo. When the cardpool eventually increases then it should be more feasable, but for now the game is excellent with two and three players. I haven't played with four players yet, and while I'm sure it works well, it seems like downtime could start to be an issue.

Enter Arkham Horror: LCG. Everything about this game feels fresh and exciting. Each new pack holds so much possibility and I can't wait to see what new twists and turns await our survivors; just lurking around the corner to break us. (10-20-17)

Absolutely fantastic. Every issue I had with the LOTR lcg has been addressed. Amazing theme and narratives... remarkable replay value.
I've completed the entire campaign and have dove back into the campaign with solo play now.  While I was concerned that each investigator had drastic strengths and weaknesses that they would be tough to roll with solo. The game plays perfectly with all solo investigators, you have to play very smart and maximize each action.  
This game was purchased on a Friday and by Monday morning had well over 15 hours of game play in.  This will continue to be a staple and highly ranked game.  
I do suggest do core copies to deck build.

Though I feel like I've hardly scratched the surfaced after playing through the first two scenarios, Arkham still has all the hallmarks of a fantastic game.  I feel as if I still don't have a full sense of the game mechanics and the possibilities of deck building, but I'm definitely hooked already.  The theme and story are engrossing, and the idea of a deck builder that plays out over the course on an ongoing campaign has me champing at the bit.

Update: Now that I've finished the first campaign and made two custom decks using the Dunwich Legacy cards and new investigators, I can't wait to keep playing.  I think the first campaign is a bit rough around the edges, especially for brand new players, but knowing what is possible moving forward makes me very excited.  Definitely a worthwhile investment.

An evolution of the LOTR LCG with greater focus on campaign play and role playing through character deck building. A better solo experience than LOTR LCG especially if the excellent "Cheating" variant is used where you can commit cards to skill checks after revealing the chaos token. Initial rating of 8.

Played twice and loved both games. Love the atmosphere, the mechanics, and the art. I think my fiance would be fine with this since it is a coop. I already have Gloomhaven and Hero Realms as campaign games, but I think this is the only deck game I would be playing regularly and it probably has a better story. However, I am a bit concerned with the time and money sink it is.

Setting up a game can be a bit fiddly but the Arkham Horror LCG does a great job of unfolding a story using a series of cards.

I'm unsure about the value proposition in the scenarios and campaigns, much of that will be determined in how much fun replaying a scenario is once you can no longer be surprised by the twists and turns.

I'm also keen to exploring the deckbuilding aspect, particularly as the card pool grows.

Streamlines LotR LCG mostly for the better. Choose-your-own-adventure style storytelling is fantastic. But the generic 'clue' gathering (quest markers) feels outdated and uninspiring, and the theme just didn't excite me. Even vaguely relevant clue cards could enhance the experience considerably.

Highly Thematic Card Co-op designed to be played in campaign mode.

Pros: Solid hand management. Really draws you into the theme. One of the few card games I've played with a "board" feeling. Solid campaign system with difficult impactful choices and a excellent level up system.

Cons: I really dislike the theme, to the point it ruins a lot of the experience for me. Winning/Losing is a bit fogged, as you progress to the campaign no matter what. It's more like live the experience and see the result. You need a lot of expansions to really see the game shine, the core set cards are really to few to show what this game can do.

This game does its best to polarise me. On the one end it's thematically terrible (for me) and I can't feel much agony since winning/losing are tonned down. On the other hand it's a mechanically engaging co-op game with a build in campaign system, which is exactly what I love! If this game had a different theme (say Star Wars, or Lord of the Rings) and a more clear impact of the individual missions it would be my all star favourite game. As it is now, I just like to play it and that's it.

As I expected, I enjoyed [thing=205637]Arkham TCG[/thing]. But is difficult to give opinions regarding it at this point: I don't know all the scenarios; I don't know the cards (I didn't built, nor want to, the decks); I don't even see all the investigators. It is so many holes that is hard to properly give a view of the game.

Yet, what I can say about it, is that it has two great mechanics: the chaos bag, that work similar as a dice to randomize bonus or penalties to tests, but it allows for customization, making possible to increase or decrease the challenge, simply by changing the distribution of tokens in the bag. The other is the way locations work in order to form the "board", by way of connections the investigators do move in a proper manner between places. It is very well thought, thematic and highly functional, specially for a card game, and it can also be customized to form new scenarios.

Even without seeing the whole game, I can already tell that the system is well done, both for the simplicity of the card play as well as for the possibilities, going from building the decks, to using icons on cards in order to help in tests, which makes cards being helpful in more ways - many times, in LotR CG I had cards that I simply couldn't use, for lack of resources or that they wouldn't have a use in the situation; this will occur much less often in [thing=205637]Arkham TCG[/thing]. Also, simply by having a proper campaign mode, it has a major plus with me. Finally, the Mythos theme is deeply present and well applied.

These are the strong points that I saw. The weak spots are the same old ones (not to be confused with the Great Old Ones): the LCG model; and the constant building and tweaking of decks - there are those that enjoy this, following the meta, learning and discussing what goes with what; but I'm not one of them - I just like to sit and play.

Overall, since I don't own (and, thus, don't have to keep buying expansions) nor build the decks, [thing=205637]Arkham TCG[/thing] only have positives for me so far. Easily recommended.

Not sure about this at the moment. The game requires a lot of effort from the players to achieve "immersion" in the theme. For example the events in the mythos and agenda decks don't always fit with the locations being investigated. The rules are oddly worded and finicky. However it's reasonably quick to play and constructing a deck to represent a campaign of encounters and acquiring injuries is quite good fun. Ultimately it seems a bit expensive for what it actually is. Perhaps I'll start to see what the point is after more plays but I think there are better Arkham games out there that I'd rather play, mansions of madness 2nd edition.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Only played the main core scenarios once:
The story telling and the resulting differences depending on how you worked out in earlier scenarios is really great and fun.

But not the token drawing thing in this game. Seems FFG wanted a new cool way for the overused skill checks with dice / 5+ rolls. Epic Fail in my opinion... or maybe just in this game.
On Normal you need to "overpower" your skill test with +2 to get a 50/50 chance to succeed. By many tests you need to boost with cards and resources, after mid game you have only one try left with a boost, then all cards / resources are gone (again).
Unfair is not difficult, my opinion.
To enjoy the game you have to play on easy, which is too easy, almost boring...
There are 4 different difficulties to set up the tokens, but none of theme is a good mix of competition and fun.

The deck building is way too less for my taste, after each scenario spending 10, 15min, separating your deck to just get 3 or 4 new / better cards seems not worth the time.

Only reason for the hype: Theme!

Recommendation: Please try the campaign for the main game, before you buy it, like my rating says "take it or leave it".

I love this shit! I'm very imaginative and the scenario layouts and eventos are as depresive as joyful! As expected for a Lovecraft serie there is little (but some at least) room for heroism, you can replay the game as many times you want but the roleplaying and suprise aspect of it can wore off after a few plays for each campaign, (that makes at least 6-12+ runs depending on how much you die ir succeed in the process). And to that you have to add 5 investigators with their mechanics, and their combinations if you play with another player :) 

I believe Fantasy Flight Games has a very good experience with Lord of the Rings LCG and that we should be expecting quality content for the upcoming expansions.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
This was my introduction to living card games. I'm fairly familiar with Lovecraftian lore and the various Fantasy Flight releases revolving around Arkham Horror, so the content was nothing new to me. The AHLCG takes an established property and breaths some new life into it. All the familiar hallmarks of Arkham Horror are there, including the dreaded mythos phase, ability checks, and clue tokens. Refreshingly, FFG have decided to drop any dice play from the game, and instead, checks are resolved by drawing tokens out of a "chaos bag". These tokens feature numbers ranging from -7 onto +2, which indicate whether or not your character has been successful. The LCG gives players more control over the checks by allowing certain cards to be played prior, which can "boost" the result of the check. To add a minor variable of chance, there are still instant fail and instant success tokens thrown in.

The major complaint I've heard regarding the base set of the LCG is that it's rather short at only three scenarios. While I'd agree with this sentiment, I'd say that the core set serves as a useful demo for players who are unsure if they want to take the plunge deeper into the depths of the AHLCG.

Quite frankly, I was highly disappointed by this game. Although I only got the core set, the game itself was simply not engaging enough for me to warrant the purchase of any expansions. I found the drawing bag to be no less random than rolling a dice, and nothing feels worse than constantly having your well thought out strategies being thwarted by luck of the draw. I do have to give the game credit for its narrative and immersive world, but as a game, Arkham Horror LCG is simply not for me.

A really great two player experience. The deck construction and upgrading takes a little effort, but you work at it together, balancing your two investigators' strengths and weaknesses, unlike competitive LCGs where you have to take the time alone. We've completed the Dunwich campaign with a side mission thrown in, for 9, and the base campaign a few times as of now. Some of the most fun we've had in the hobby.

It seemed like an interesting game when we started off - but the game architecture means to keep playing you need to keep buying new stuff - replay-ability is very low, even if the difficulty level\ investigator options bring in some variation.

TL;DR:
Low value for the core box
Little player agency, a lack of meaningful choices
Scenario Narrative is unsatisfying
Lots of art is reused from other games
Lots of cards in the base set are built to be ineffective

The game in this box supports only 2 players, and thats if they choose exclusive deck builds. The game assumes every player will buy at least 1 core set, and each player would need 2 core sets in order to have a collection that could play characters that use overlapping deck builds.

The times I played through there was little agency. The scenario progressed in a linear fashion and options were limited at each point. At the end of the scenario, we learned that 2 of the characters cannot win the first scenario with any of the cards available to them in the base game.

I was surprised at the lack of approaches, since Elder Sign, Arkham Horror and Eldritch Horror not only allow multiple approaches but require them in order to overcome obstacles.

Great alternative from LotR: TCG. Much more story and campaign driven. With the experience system, you'll probably only upgrade a few cards in-between games. You do not have to deck build for every single encounter, like LotR. The stories are good, the characters diverse in their abilities, and the encounters are challenging. The first encounter does a good job of showing you how to play.

Thank you SS 2016.

Edit: We have played through the mini-campaign Night of the Zealot 3 times...never winning, and the full Dunwich campaign once again lost. I like the narrative this game weaves, much more thematic than LotR LCG; however the limit of failing and moving on still sours me a bit...we've played maybe three quests and just had the worst draws and lost within the first 2-3 turns. Might be a little too fiddly, I prefer LotR, but this is still a fun one to bring out. This is the feeling I was hoping for from Mansions of Madness v2...I have zero desire to play that having this one.

I'm inclined to give this a decent rating, but I'm not sure that we played correctly.  Learning a new game at 10 pm is never a good idea, particularly when you're nose-deep in the rulebook for long stretches.

I will say that there's an ocean (ok, at least a sea) of downtime with four players.  One factor was the chit-drawing mechanic, which could have easily been replaced by a specially designed d10 or d12.  To speed things up, you could opt for simultaneous turns - and we did towards the end - but multi-horror solitaire isn't my style.  I'd try again with two players, assuming that my fellow investigator (i.e., the game's owner) learns the rules intimately.  Or at least gets to second base.

Also, the boss battle at the end is a grind.  That was unexpected, and not necessarily in a good way.

Beautiful art. But, very complex, time-consuming to set up, quite difficult. Not something you can just play casually with a bit of music and wine.

Ufff, after just one game I'm very very disappointed, but I have to give it another chance and maybe I'll change my rate.
Reading other comments I thought that this would be a nearly role playing experience but so far I find it very very very far from a RPG. I'll give a great sample (NO SPOILERS):
After only visiting room X, thanks to one of my cards I got quite tokens to continue the story one step. And the story tells "you took blablablah from room Y and blablablah from room X and go to blablablah", but I didn't visit the room Y!!! That sentence completely broke the climax!!
And finally, it seems that this will be very similar to what I hate in Arkham Horror, you are walking while enemies come out from nowhere without any reason.

Such a thematic experience and a great play with a buddy. Making the deck your own as you go through scenarios, trying to survive through everything the game is throwing at you. Can't get enough of this one.

The genius of this game is that the multiple locations (mapped out by location cards) creates a true adventure board in front of you -- a board that changes radically with each scenario!

I have owned this game for months (bought in November 16) and have played the 2 first scenario of the base game campaign.

I find it pleasant but I'm not hooked. I expected to be caught in some kind of "LCG frenzy" but I'm just interesting by the idea of playing the next scenario ... one day.

1st campaign finished: 
Still quite disappointed by the amount of things to remember and the difficulty to get a certitude in the middle of a play and by the amount of manipulation to do for a small amount of scenario ...

I will retry with a single investigator to see if it diminishes the sensation of fiddlyness.

It's surprising how fun this game is when it's fairly basic mechanics are examined closely. But it's the deck construction that makes this game a big winner. That, and the short playtime compared to its big brothers.

RATING: 6
Even after getting all the current expansions, you can only swap about 8 cards in each deck, and it's nearly impossible to have options if someone is sharing a minor class with you.

Really wish there was more flexibility without needing 6+ expansions before it becomes an actual deck-builder.

FFG's two-rulebook system failed me on this one.  I've never played a LCG before, and found a lot of stuff during our first play that I just couldn't find answers to in either rulebook.  Usually it's in one or the other, but we really had a hard time with this one.  Component-wise, it's standard FFG quality, which is good.  The art is nice. Gameplay is ok for now, probably would be better with fewer stoppages to look up rules. The core set contains 3 scenarios that make up one campaign and further scenarios/campaigns are to come in the extra packs and expansions ... so it'll be expensive to keep playing. As for replayability, it's more like re-playing a boss fight in a video game than it is re-reading the same chapter of a book for the 12th time. That is to say, it should be fine. Obviously more scenarios will help, but you could probably play through the core campaign a few times without getting tired of it.

This one is a complicated one for me. I have hard mixed feelings about it.

It fluctuates between: it's a involving game that portraits Lovecraft's world in a pretty cool. To: I cannot deal with an LGC and I was expecting something else.

I played easy mode. Started the campaign with 2 players. But after the first game I had to continue alone, since I couldn't get my girlfriend to go back to it and being punched in the face until we were dead.

So first, this is a hard game, HARD. Which, sure, being a co-op, it has to be hard, bla bla, ya. But still, I don't believe that I had any change (specially on that 3rd scenario). What makes really sad and weary is that I truly believe that FFG don't expect you to win it with just one copy of the base game. Since the cards available are not good enough to build a proper deck(s). And to that, I say: SCREW YOU! It just feels unfair. Give me, in the "base game", enough for me to have a "base ability" to fight back, or at least to stand a change.

On another hand (and here it might be my TIME Stories' previous-story-based-game-experience-and-expectations), I was expecting something else. I do think the mechanics are good, but I was expecting more of a puzzle (since we're playing detectives) and less of a pure skill checker game. There's a lot of decisions to take on this game, sure. But I felt that none actually matter (with the base game only) in face to enemies. Having, only, as weapons my(our) crappy decks and that devilish bag of tokens.
I have to give it, after the 2nd scenario I started to see the true potential of the system. It did get me curious with it for the future.

In the end, maybe, just maybe, in some years, if I find someone selling a big collection (which includes way more than the base game for sure) I might buy it again and have a proper full experience. For now, I'm trading it away. 

Traded.

I didn't enjoy the gameplay at all. The chaos bag (and all the mechanics related to it like the testing and commiting of cards) is one of the least fun mechanics I have ever seen in a card game. It's just the personification of randomness. No real emotion behind it. The fact that most of the time if you fail means nothing doesn't help me see it with other eyes.

I can get past the limited deckbuilding (and replayability), but until I can figure out a way to enjoy the gameplay, this game is going to be collecting dust on my shelf.

Excellent story-based co-op adventure game.  Probably one of my favorite for matching the theme and story to the game play.  Pure deck-building is, however, not one of my favorites as it requires too much pre-game hassle.  So, using only the pre-built decks is probably the only way we'll play this, and that is a little limiting.

We're in the early exploring times with this game and I think it is going to reveal plenty of engaging twists and turns. I like the approach to deck building with limitations according to the various characters and the way the experience system works to gradually improve decks over time. I have invested in this one and I'm happy to acquire up to the end of the Dunwich Legacy play it through and make a judgement call on whether to go on from there. My early impression is very positive though, I give it an 8.5 to start.

I'm in for the long haul, have all the packs and will buy new ones on sight!

Thematically rich, this is a delicious cultist-covered bridge between the complexity of the Elder Sign dice game and the fiddly thematic smorgasbord of the Arkham and Eldritch Horror board games. Yes, there is some setup involved as far as the decks and the scenarios are concerned, but it is most definitely far less cumbersome of a game than it's big box counterparts.

This game is amazing. -1 point for only including half the game in the box :(. Can't even make an optimised deck for 1 character from 1 core set. Why should I have to buy a 2nd core for 100x drink coasters and the 5 extra cards I wanted? Come on.... sell me a 2nd Shrivelling separate please :D If you are at all interested in deckbuilding then just buy a 2nd core. There's no other way around it.

As another FFG refinement of an earlier product (LotR LCG), this is again really well done. Scenarios are fun to play and the ongoing campaign mechanics are very engaging.

Core set card distribution is a large disappointment, where a second core is pretty much mandated but only offers 70 cards of value after the first core set. They should have offered basically a mythos pack containing the 70 cards for $17. Until they do, I can't support this for full price.

Took a bit of understanding, but once you start gameplay seems straightforward enough, and there's enough variation in the way the game can develop. Single player, it seems a little flat, but in fairness I only played one scenario on easy/standard. Looking forward to advancing through the story. Seems expensive though.

Finished the story and not keen to play again. Sold it to a colleague.

Az LCG most nagy kedvenc, így adtam neki egy esélyt. Az első játék annak ellenére is tetszett, h semmi közöm nincs az AH világához. Nehéz volt, de gondolom idővel több esélyünk lesz a szörnyek ellen, így fogok még próbálkozni. A hangulatot nagyban segíti a gyönyörű dizájn és az apró részletességgel megírt flavor textek, így közepes vagy erős angol az mindenképpen előny a játékhoz.

I am guessing that Fantasy Flight went with Arkham Horror: the Card Game because Arkham Horror: The Chit Bag Game was less catchy even though its more accurate. I mean sure there are cards in the game and you get to play them, but your going to spend more time pulling chits out of a bag than playing cards, and the cards you do play only facilitate pulling chits out of a bag better. 
Speaking of Chit bags, this particular chit bag is the opposite of fun and is functionally the same as rolling a really shitty die. One that you have to roll for everything you want to do. If you want to add difficulty to the game, your out of luck, because the difficulty levels are just making the already shit die even MORE shit YAY, let chance rolls take care of difficulty instead of making the scenario longer. But that would involve including more cards in a card game, which is no good apparently.
OH speaking of more cards, There are not enough cards in this game for deck customization, Not a good sign for a game that markets itself as a "deck building game." I would like to believe that each character plays very different and is very unique but when every character shares 10 or more cards with each other I just don't see it. Not that I'm going to play again to find out.

Just about what I want and expect out of an Arkham Files game. The game places you on the shoes of an investigator and it works pretty well. Very immersive.

I read complaints about deckbuilding options right out of the box being rather limited, which is true (unless you buy two boxes, which I did), but to me, unlike other deckbuilders, regular actions like moving around from locations, exploring and investigating and fighting/evading monsters is what this is all about, to a point where the card game aspect becomes secondary to the game (so much so that you could probably play with the suggested decks and do "ok", even if they're pretty bland), and I think this is just fine.

Excellent simulation of the French Indo-China war. All the elements are there, the Viet Minh rule the jungle but the French excel in the Delta. The trick is winning in your opponents territory.

Very good production values, colourful and evocative map, attractive counters which are nice and large and thanks to Legion's "easypunch" system literally fall out of the sprues with no need for trimming.

 Juego asimétrico con dos fases diferenciadas. Por un lado la fase de movimientos y por otra la de operaciones. El juego es muy jugoso y muy profundo con muy pocas reglas. No apto para todo tipo de jugadores. Una exquisitez oriental.

Dean Essig let this one get away from the OCS system, so Kim Kanger and company jumped upon it. An excellent and rare title that explores the 1st Indochine War in detail.

Only one incomplete play of the training scenario, so take this rating with as many grains of salt as you wish.  There are certainly elements of the design that I like.  For instance, the dependence of Viet Minh reinforcements on their victory point score, the trade offs between supply dumps and replacements, and the v.p. costs to the French of reinforcements.  The asymmetrical nature of the conflict is well simulated.  Indeed, I would recommend Tonkin to anyone whose primary interest is in simulating this conflict.  

However, my first encounter with the game turned out a dull, attritional slugfest, with a degree of fiddliness and rules overhead that I just don't enjoy.  

Production quality is pretty good by wargame standards.  Those counters really did punch out very easily.  I liked the artwork on the counters.  The map is not exactly pretty, but effort has been put in to making it functional, down to numbers on some hexes to aid set-up. The rules are clearly written and logically sequenced.

ce jeu est remarquable sur un sujet peu traité. Il décrit bien les différentes stratégies entre le Viet Minh et le Corps Expéditionnaire Français. C'est un wargame très riche concernant les possibilités avec des composants superbe. Seul regret, il est long c'est pourquoi je ne lui ai pas mis 10.
Very wonderful wargame about this badly known war between France and Viet Minh. Components are beautiful and possibilities for both sides are very differents and interesting. it's a bit too long reason why I don't give him a 10 but you can buy it without a doubt.

No lo considero un mal juego, pero el acercamiento al mismo no es nada sencillo ni intuitivo. Las mecánicas son algo liosas y es poco ágil en general.

Dista mucho de ser un wargame al uso, tiene muchas mecánicas diferentes y en cierto modo originales, con unos bandos muy asimétricos. Es necesario conocer bien tanto tus puntos fuertes como los del rival y eso hace que sea complicado saber en cada momento donde estás y a donde vas. El Setup también es lentísimo y la campaña es enormemente larga.

En mi caso personal, mi poco conocimiento del conflicto y el poco interés que me despierta me han lastrado bastante. Consiero también que las reglas no son intuitivas y desde luego tampoco fáciles, aunque no sean demasiado extensas. Desde mi punto de vista, es necesaria bastante dedicación para sacarle el verdadero jugo.

Salvando sus puntos negativos, pienso que con la dedicación que indico, se puede llegar a disfrutar con él, pero desde luego te tiene que interesar el conflicto más que a mi.

Good ideas for the Sequence of play, the Operations Phase, although it could be streamlined somewhat with Operations Points then SD spends etc.

Way too many modifiers, details, exceptions. Combat system is attritional. Too many pieces on map when the system rewards concentration.

Too much work for enjoyment.

Components are fine, not sure about the map. Play aids are incomplete in my opinion.

Up for trade!

Probably at its best playing the scenarios over the campaign game--unless you have a deep interest in the conflict or have a long weekend to leave it up.

Both sides must juggle how to attack/protect objectives with the least risk to manpower and the least cost in supplies. Both sides will need to make the decision of when to break off operations to refit and rebuild and when to keep up the pressure on their opponent.

A friend and I played through the first eight turns of the campaign and I frittered the French VP level down to 25 from a start of around 85. I had cleared out the Delta, but was looking at the daunting task of fighting a nimble for in the highlands

Pretty fun, but requires that both players settle in for the long-haul and husband resources. There are no knock-out blows or killer strategies.

Intriguing and quite differetnt play styles for the two sides, you'll understand why the french used the paras and why the VM stayed in the rough terrain.

My oldest son and I start playing this game during our vacation and have been completely captured by the game.

We are really not very interested in this particular war, but this sleek, easy to play and very exciting game has definitely earned its place in my collection.

VERY initial rating partial play only 

I liked it overall especially the nods to OCS and think it should be a fun game, but have a fair size hesitation with it. I didn't want to believe it since the book was only 15 or 16 pages or so, but it seems there are a few too many fiddly rules, which to me, amounted to very little effect and were tricky to remember so didn't seem worth it (I guess for accuracy, but I prefer them for more interesting chrome effects for example). Several things came up in our game that we could not find definitive answers for (sadly I have a knack for poking holes in rules) A really good player aid or 2 page cheat sheet might help here

There are a few very interesting things included here in Tonkin, like units being able to move several times in a turn which keeps tensions up all over the place. The 2 VM objectives with one being a bluff, the supply dumps needing to be positioned. The VP cities in the Delta and Highlands is a bit of a tug of war, the French would like to vacant some of them in the Delta but if he does they convert to the VM, which then makes it easier for him to take all 10 and then gain VP’s to help him. 

The Campaign will be pretty long for sure, but I like there is a short scenario and then some very manageable ones as well all combined to make up that campaign, so you can bite it off in chunks.  Not sure I like the Disorg rules, its pretty harsh on a couple big stacks attacking. Need to play again hopefully a full game to get a better handle on it.

I like this game a lot.  It feels like a trimmed down version of OCS designed for insurgency type games.

I enjoyed the training scenario.  The NVA need to be aggressive while they maneuver for advantage vs getting into a slugging match with the French.

Played the campaign game twice.  Feels well balanced.  Lots of different options for both players.

Not sure how to rate this. I give it a 9 because it is a really clever design that has a ton of historical flavor. I don't think there are any other good games on the subject (I may well be overlooking one or two), and this is a good game. Kim Kanger is one of the best and most original designers out there. Really nice treatment of supply that just 'feels' right. I also love the weak ZOC (and nonexistant ZOC for French troops into forest or mountains) and the operations, which allow for some startling movements and attacks. Again, it feels right.

The game isn't that difficult to learn, but there is a fair amount of chrome. It would have been nice to have more examples of play, but generally everything is in the rules.

The VM have a tough fight against the FEF, requiring to reach an ever decreasing VP level to receive reinforcements. Whilst the Highlands are initially easy pickings, once moving out of Vietnam and into Laos supply becomes a major issue. The FEF can quickly garrison any airfield or sea port with troops, but the VM can double move quickly through the forest terrain along the river valleys. Whilst Tieu Doan are plentiful, Pathet Lao are few in number and worth their weight in gold, being permanently in supply within Laos.

The highlands are crucial to winning the game. The FEF must protect it and the VM must take it, both without losing too many troops. After the highlands fall to the VM, they can continue onto blitzing across the open terrain and capturing cities. (Remember that the DNA units can pass through VM units on a coastal hex, which can help with the evacuation and reinforcement of cities.)

Excellente simulation qui correspond à mes lectures. L'asymétrie des 2 armées est parfaitement rendue. Beaucoup de choix opérationnels pour les 2 camps. Combats passionnants et (paradoxalement) un peu répétitifs. Quelques règles politiques en options auraient été bienvenues.

Very Nice components & clever design. 

Groupes Mobiles, Bataillons aéroportés, Dinassault, Dien Bien Phu ! You got a good feeling of the struggle of the Corps Expéditionnaire Français en Indochine...

RATING: 10
Brilliant game.   Both players feel beleaguered, even at times with neither are.  The fluidity of the situation, the maneuverability of the Vietminh and the constant juggling act the French have to engage in make this one a real challenge.

Brilliant design, superb simulation (history and logistics) with inventive elements, but with a high learning curve.  The game is genuinely fun to play as one gets more comfortable with the rules, but these are rather too detailed for my taste.  My only other complaint is that setup instructions should be better consolidated.  Players who are not put off by complexity will no doubt rate this more highly.

Why can't all wargame publishers make chits like this company's?  They just fall out of the holders.  Oh, and the game is pretty good too!  Good coverage on another one of France's backwater wars.

Just received this (Jan 2012) Haven't had a chance to play it, but the components look great. First game I've gotten from Legion Wargames, very impressed with whole package.

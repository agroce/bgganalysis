At LAST!  A zombie game that I really liked!  This is an excellent solitaire game.  I suspect that you are going to lose a lot more than you win, and that is fine because it makes winning that much sweeter.
It gives you constant sense of impending doom: one stress-filled moment after another, with only brief pauses to reload and find more ammunition and such.
There are not enough action points in a turn and it seems like the zombies are always closing in.  What a rush!

Excelente solitario del género "defiende la torre". Tienes que impedir que los Zombis se apoderen del centro de la cuidad. Turno a turno verás como ordas invaden poco a poco las calles. Muy difícil de ganar, presenta un reto dificil a batir. Aunque el juego tiene muchas reglas, éstas están planteadas a modo de tutorial, como en los videojuegos.

A lot more complex game than it seems, but it delivers a really enjoyable experience, fighting zombies in a city with only small resources. Overall a good experience with gorgeous components, but inelegant game with a quite important setup and sometimes overcomplicated rules. The main feeling of the game is that you basically use more time to move and play zombies against yourself than using the few actions you have at your disposal.

Initial Impression: Wonderful production quality in this gold banner edition of the game. Everything about this game oozes theme; the chunky counters have little "bites" taken out of them, the images are dark and bloody, the quick setup instructions are written like someone giving you some last minute advice. The 3 levels of scenarios ease new players into the system. This is easily my favorite States of Siege game so far. Action points can be used so many different ways that the game doesn't feel constricting. The decisions are tense and some mistakes can be unforgiving. This has become one of my few favorite solitaires, giving me that "Just one more turn" desire.

10 Plays: I'm still loving this game. I now have a better idea of what to do during those rare "breather" turns where I actually have spare actions. I've developed a preference for certain characters but try to mix things up a bit. The base game was challenging enough but in my never-ending need for more I added the Director's Cut expansion. This expansion adds more Events and Fate cards, integrating perfectly with the base game without adding many more rules. My one complaint is that I find the new characters are much more powerful than the previous characters and I'm finding the game a bit easier.

RATING: 5
Feels more like a wargame than like a typical Ameritrash zombie game. No surprise though: it uses the State of the Siege system which is used in many other VP games. 
The game is extremely challenging and hard to win. Every kind of crazy shit can happen that you know from zombie movies: Refugees, Raiders, airstrikes, nuclear meltdown, research for a cure...the list goes on forever. 
The rules are pretty heavy too for a relatively short and mechanically simple game. Lots of special cases which make it hard for me to bring this on the table. 
The second edition adds even more stuff like the tunnel into town and a crazy scientist...things go a little bit off the rails here. The second edition board looks terribly crowded and confusing to me...I prefer the first edition here although the components are fantastic in the second. 
If I find the time and energy to go through the rules again, I´ll give this another shot (maybe the first edition). Always enjoyed it when I played it...

until now (2014 july) the best zombie game i`ve ever played. very thematic, and very fun. 

the only failure i see: there are easy plays and very hard plays. but the game usually is not unbalanced. 

i've won over 50% plays. and i think the game should be more hard, but all the victories (except tutorial or some classic games) have been agonic. so... great fun!

Wow!! I balked at the £45 asking price (+£10 shipping) on UK OLGS and added this to an order I had from CSI (only increased shipping by $5!!) and I am sooooo glad that I did. Beautifully crafted solitaire experience. It creates a wonderful story and you find yourself getting attached to the small civilian chits (especially the well armed ones!) My favourite solitaire game at the moment! Glad that I got my hands dirty with this one (literally.... the game comes with a napkin to wipe the soot off!)

The more I play it, the more I like it. Great narrative, meaningful decisions, and the luck of the draw just keeps pounding on you turn after turn. If I have one complain that keeps this from being a 9, is that it is a tad too long..

Superb narrative and rich decisions, with tremendous replayability due to the setup randomizations and dice usage. A blast to play.

While not a huge fan of zombie-themed games, this one does the job very well.  It gives you a cinematic feel of the impending doom, while you're fighting to stave off the zombie hordes heading towards your precious town.  Recommended for solo gamers, at least try it out sometime to see what it's like, and if it's for you.

RATING: 9
Fun solo game. Love to play - have played the basic scenario twice and the "classic" scenario once. A very engrossing challenge that makes you think, but not impossible.

The gameplay is excellent. The game is held back only by layout and the rules, which are pretty are horrible. Not a big fan of the art, although it's not as bad as the layout and rules. The production looks amateurish. 

This game still rates a "9" because I love tower defense games involving zombies - so this game fits me well. I am somewhat excited about the recently announced 3rd edition, and hopeful that VPG will make some changes.

While many games have the 1-X players option, most of them come up short when playing solo. They're fun, sure, but most games are designed around at least *some* level of interaction. So I began looking into solitaire specific games for a better experience, which is when I came across several lists recommending this game. I sprang for it, and boy was it worth it! Even learning the game was a blast (despite having an introductory scenario that leaves out a TON of important rules and mechanics, which is one of my only qualms with the game). You feel the pressure of the impending zombies without the game restricting what you can do. Too many games make the intensity increase by limiting you, a strategy that is luckily absent in this game (with regards to decisions, not resources). Excellent quality (many of the pieces are some of the best "punch out" pieces I've ever run across). If you ever play solitaire games, this is a MUST for your collection!

Me decepcionó bastante... Tampoco tengo claro qué es lo que esperaba de este juego, pero los bandazos que pega el azar son absurdamente incontrolables. Puedes ir ganando y perderlo todo en 1 turno, o todo lo contrario, depende de cómo los dados y las cartas decidan mostrarse.

RATING: 9
Very worthwhile solo game. Highly recommended. I like the programmed approach to learning the game -- you play a Quick Play/Tutorial scenario, then you play the Classic Nightmare scenario (the first-edition approach), followed finally by the main game which can be played as a short, medium, or long scenario. So you learn the rules, then you level up the challenge. Most rules are straightforward, and you'll get the basic rhythm of the game as you play, but there are some special situations and contingencies, and for me, I benefited from the Geek forums where the designer is active. I highly recommend this game to patient, serious strategy gamers who enjoy cinematic strategic challenges that take about 3 hours (this game is by its nature longer-form).

[February 2016] Bumped this up to a 9. While the game has its fiddly aspects -- necessitating deep rereading of the rules (and watching even experienced players in session videos, they'll forget something here or there or get something wrong) -- it is deeply enjoyable and extremely replayable. Note that I am including Director's Cut in my playthroughs, so my 9 is with the game fully expanded. Looking forward to third edition!

One of the best solo games out there with a nice theme.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
This is a great solo game.  It is cinematic, your decisions matter but crazy stuff can happen, and it is capital F Fun.  The heroes feel like distinct individuals and add so much wonderful flavor to every game.  I take DotZ on every business trip that I can fit it (and I will neither confirm or deny that I've ever skipped part of a conference to play it).

I do have a couple minor complaints that have started to wear on me as I play more:
  
1) I'm not crazy about the foraging mechanism.  Parking a guy on a resource cache and using an action every turn to roll a die in the hopes of maybe getting one supply or ammo is not terribly interesting.  I much prefer the mission-based methods of getting supplies, and wish there were more of them, enough so that foraging would need be only a last resort.  

2)I wish there were fewer special rules for the superzombies.  Some of them, like the ones that get stronger when you flip them, or the just plain super strong ones, are no problem because everything you need is on the chit.  Others, like the leapers, are a headache to deal with (especially because the name "leapers" doesn't really help you - why can they "leap" over catacombs in underground caves?).  True, I can always just play without these guys, but I like the concept of superzombies pouring out of the catacombs.  I just wish their implementation was more streamlined.

The rulebook is a challenge to get through the first time, but it is wonderful as a reference. I plowed through it, but if I had followed the recommended tutorial procedure I likely would have had an easier time.  Once you get going, the rulebook is *great* because fiddly little rules are repeated in many places, so you are likely to find them no matter where you look. I can't overstate how much I appreciate this type of rulebook design.  Give me a separate quick start book, but make the main rules good for in-play referencing!  That being said, the game could really use a master cheat-sheet like the one promised for the Director's Cut expansion.

[u]The Good[/u]: This holds the distinction among my collection as being the one with the most game crammed into the smallest box. It has a decent amount of moving parts, and the ruleset is deep - but there is even more here than all of that together. A true case of a game being more than the sum of its parts.

[u]The Bad[/u]: Uses the States of Seige engine, which features too much symmetry I think. It's the game's only weakness in my eyes, anyway. You see - this game tells an amazing story, one where straight lines and clean angles seem out of place.

[u]The Bottomline[/u]: If you like "falling into" your board games, this one is right up there. The story each play will tell, turn by turn, is akin to any great zombie flick you can name. Now the rules are a beast to get down, but if you get off on this sort of cinematic gameplay thing, and you don't mind a zombie or two, I can't recommend this game highly enough.

Dawn of the Zeds (2nd Edition) is simply a tremendous game. The components are excellent, the back story surprisingly engaging (surprising, because I had no previous Zombie interest). But the real story is the game-play. The "Tunnel Track" of the Second Edition, adds amazing layers of both tactical and strategic options, while at the same time fleshes out the "theme" of the game brilliantly. I am a big fan of "State of Siege" solitaire games in general, but "Zeds" takes that "system" to new levels of complex, and intriguing dimensions. 
Some quibbles: 
Game length: A full campaign game takes a fair chunk of time, even after you have mastered the game -- which takes several playings to achieve. There are many things to keep track of (I missed something rather important my first 16! games), and you really have to focus.
Balance: This isn't really much of a quibble. The complexity and dimension of Zeds allows player skill to greatly influence the course of the game. Beginners are simply overwhelmed by the "unstoppable" Zombies. Eventually, players can find so many "tricks of the trade" to completely "flip" the winning percentage. At no point however, will you ever sit down to a game "assured" of winning, and the great majority of your victories will feel very well-earned. You want a greater challenge -- this is a solitaire game -- simply ratchet up the difficult level, and continue to enjoy one of the best gaming experiences anywhere.

This is exactly the game that I want to play - an 'us versus them' game that is hard to win and gives the vibe of impending doom.  This is probably a 8.5 for me.

Those times tend to happen late at night when I don't have the time for a full game of this.

Solitaire beast. After much satisfaction of playing Infection, I decided to get few more Victory Point games. Zombie theme...has to be good right?

Victory Point games is hitting it with every game I tried so far! Yes, there are many number of upkeeps and small rules to keep track of, but they did fantastic job with rule-book and quick-play guide so that first time player would not get lost. However, this is coming from me experienced in playing MK so I would highly recommend people to stay away from this game if this is your first game into board games...as it is a beast of a game. Definitely a game that you will have to find time to sit down for hours to read and figure out how to play.

But the game itself is very enjoyable. A perfect solitaire with a lot of meat to it. If you need a heavy solitaire, try this. Very awesome.

I don't like zombies (generally speaking) but for this game the theme fits like a glove. It's a top solitaire game that puts you in a Z-movie. 
Could be one of the best State of Siege games but hasn't the fast play of Ottoman Sunset for example, and some exceptions and rules are a little cumbersome. That leads to not so many plays for my part. 
Even so, recommended for its exceptional narrative.

Excellent game, near endless possibilities available due to the scenarios, maps and cards that are included with the Deluxe Edition. We play with our own cooperative rules and it is actually way better than Zombicide! Running low on ammo, worrying about refugees/supplies/Bubba's Band/soaring infection rate/Pickles being alone at the Mine - all add up to one major stress fest that only strategic thinking and gutsy dice rolls will overcome. Fantastic.

January 2015 - Perhaps the finest "Let's all survive the Zombies" games out there... largely because it is a solo game... so there's no need to get into groupthink / follow-the-leader's plan stuff.

RATING: 9.1
After 30+ games played upped my rating from 8.3 to 9.
This game is just great end entertaining each time you play. Even if you lose.

I thought it might get boring after a while because the scenario stays the same. But the swings in this game can be so different that you never know what story the game will tell you this time.
One time it starts slowly and innocent just to crush you later on. Other times you're overwhelmed right from the beginning and have no idea how to survive the first 10 turns. But if you do there will be a calm phase where you can recover... hopefully.

Excellent design. Great components.

Oh, and by the way: I'm not even a must-have-all-zombie-games zombie nerd...

Dawn of the Zeds is by now the best solitaire board game that I possess. It tells perfectly the zombie apocalypse story on a board game: how the survivors organize, get armed and resist the advancing mobs of undead in a besieged town. I am delighted by the great amount of possibilities and decisions you have. It feels very thematic and immersive, and it is a shame that this game is -by now- just solitaire.

The only flaws are its length (too long for a solitaire) and the rules, which are unnecessarily demanding. The level of difficulty is too high (I won after 6 plays).

First off, what a great game! I love games with solo variants, and this is my first truly solo game. I have to say that at first, I was a bit overwhelmed by the amount of rules, exceptions etc etc, and even considered trading it or selling it. But thankfully I stuck to it, reading comments and other things on here and watching some gameplay videos.

Since then I have purchased the expansion, which is great, and had the Tim Allen map professionally printed. If your going to play this game, Id suggest getting the Tim Allen map right away, the other map is very confusing. 

A point on Victory Point Games. Their customer service is the best service I have ever dealt with. They responded to my emails within minutes of sending them to the dreaded info@... They sent me a free copy of the Allen map with my expansion order, just fantastic!

So overall, great game, awesome theme, there is not one time where I wasn't sitting on the edge of my seat wondering what other atrocities can come up next. Also, if you want a little more immersive gameplay, check youtube for a Zombie playlist, like the 28 days later OST and play that while playing, really adds to the tension!

If your considering getting this game, get it, you won't regret it!

Fun solitaire zombie game, based on the State of Siege system. The player will be trying to fight/ delay zombies marching down several separate tracks, using civilians of varying strength, along with heroes. Components in 2nd edition are quite nice. Rules are really ok, but layed out in a way where it's not always easy to find what you're looking for. Probably one of the best zombie themed games around, even if solitaire.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I have a number of plays under my belt now and I am still loving it. This is a tough game, but losing has never been such fun. The mechanics are intuitive and as all good mechanisms they seem to fade away into the theme. And the theme is very strong with this game. Zombie movies etc are all about surviving with very ever diminishing resources. This game recreates that tension perfectly. You feel like you are hanging on by your finger nails at times, which allows for those great moments of finding ammo or managing to kill a zed unit against all odds. One of the best solo games around.

[u]20-Jan-2014[/u]:  Is it a wargame?  Is it a Zombie movie?  It's both!  Wow, even though I've only had a chance to play one session, this game is fantastic.  I'm sure this rating will go up once I gain a little more experience with it.

So thematic.  So tough.  The narrative just unfolds in front of your eyes as you try to save your town from the zombies working their way ever closer to it center.

The Gold Banner Edition has excellent components with all kinds of odd shaped, thick cut counters and tokens.  Very good art.  Just an amazing game.  Looking forward to delving more into this one in the coming year.

*March 2013* I'm torn about purchasing it. On the one hand, I own enough solitaire games, I already own the first edition, and funds are not unlimited. On the other hand, the new components (including easier to shuffle cards) and new gameplay additions look really nice. 

We'll have to see

*April 2013* After playing the 1st edition enough, I see that I really like it.... and dislike the components enough. Awaiting order

This is an excellently done solitaire game. The setup of the game adds for a good amount of randomness, while still creating an interesting story arc. The rulebook can be tough to navigate, which is probably my main knock against the game. Ultimately, though, I'm digging it.

RATING: 9
An excellent, narrative zombie (war)game in a simple rules frame. 
Big kudos for the love and passion of an "artisan" gamebox: sturdy counters, nice graphic, well written rulebook (even if a bit dispersive) and excellent maps. Great replayability: in one box you have 3 game layers, and the complete experience is quite meaty.

There are tons of zombie games around, many of them well advertised (Zombicide, ecc..), but to me this is the one to pick for a large scale zombi apocalypse. Hidden gem.

You coordinate the defences of a small town trying to survive siege by the undead while waiting for the National Guard relief column to fight its way to you. Regular citizens may emerge as heroes as you work to halt the Zeds' advances by (re)killing them, discovering and implementing a cure to the viral scourge, and preserving the area and its inhabitants as much as possible

A thematic solitaire horror campaign game.

Is this the best States of Siege can offer? I guess it's not for me, then. Too random. I like the theme, and the game gives a good story, but you need to be lucky to win, and I don't like that in a solitaire game. It's OK in a multiplayer game like Eldritch Horror, because I can laugh about our misfortune together with the others.

A great solo experience! And it is more an "experience" than anything else. It's random, brutal, and oftentimes unfair. But it creates a fun story that you get to watch play out.

The second edition board is plain ugly. Bland and boring and does nothing to pull you into the town you're defending. And the setup time, requiring you to create and shuffle multiple decks and use certain numbers of cards from each deck in certain orders, mixed with other cards from some decks but not others, while stacking each new deck in....ok you get it. It's annoying.

A fun game!

Beautiful components, a wildly thematic ride but... that's what it is. A simple rollercoaster. The decisions are all obvious and when it comes down to the wire, the game starts to feel like you're running on rails rather than at some nail biting tension point where every action matters.

RATING: 8
this is a pretty good solo game. It sat on the shelf awhile before I was able to crack it out. Unlike some other reviews on the laser cut Victory Point pieces they dont bother me at all. I think the thickness and quality of the pieces is great. The inclusion of an example of play that flows into an introductory game was well done and all the player aids are great. It took a couple of play through and rules flipping sessions to get all the details of the rules down, but overall this an enjoyable fun game to play. I think this a great example of what the state of siege series can do.

IMHO, this is THE BEST zombie boardgame in the market: it´s immersive, terrifying, a little bit overwhelming at the beginning due its rules (constant rulebook flipping...), but and as it goes, a story is being created through each play. And it´s a fantastic solo game, but sometimes I´ve played as a 2 player-cooperative as is fine.

Victory Point Games specialise in these solo 'base under siege' exercises, and Zeds is arguably the best of them (certainly the best I've played myself). Doesn't take excessively long (about an hour, in my experience) but has plenty going on to think about. There are also several extra mechanisms and layers of complexity you can add as you become proficient, which gives the game some longevity. Even the simplest form has plenty to do, though. 

Overall, a good solo game which is hampered only by how many bits there are - and consequently how long it takes to set up.

RATING: 10
Extremely long setup. I need to find some good storage solution, other way I will have difficulties with bringing this to the table. 
And the first game was perfect. Zombies everywhere. I was helplessly looking at the death of next groups of villagers and heroes... Short on supplies and ammo, with low gun power. Very good game What may I do to keep them alive? At least a bit longer?

Dawn of the Zeds is one of the "States of Siege" games from Victory Point Games. It is primarily intended as a solitaire game, but can be played as a cooperative multiplayer game. The object is to survive the zombie apocalypse long enough to make it through a variable event deck. The game really has you dreading each event card draw and really makes for some tense decisions. The production isn't the greatest, but everything is of an adequate quality. I did have to wipe down all of the tokens because there was quite a bit of soot on them, but it wasn't too much of a hassle. I highly recommend this (or whatever SoS game floats your boat) if you enjoy solitaire gaming.

Tough as nails, and spins a great story. A game that drags you outside, and gives you a real kicking, but keeps you coming back for more.

Update November 2015 - sold. Just way way too complicated to come back to after not having played for ages. With the full game the rules are too complicated, the learning curve too steep for something I want to play a couple of times a year - you need to be playing this regularly to get the most out of it.

Great upgrade to an already stellar game. The best solitaire zombie game I have played, by a long shot. New characters and features bring a lot more replayability. It's still a very swingy game that can change dramatically in a turn or two. Components, rules, and player aids generally well done. Complaints are minor: original map can easily lead to errors when moving units along the track (I prefer the clearer alternate map produced by VPG in January 2014); also, it would have been better to put the instructional text at the top, rather than the bottom of the cards. Some rules, like the stacking limits, feel a little gamey but the rationale for them is understandable. The fun factor of this game is huge and the tension is always high; it definitely has that "one more turn" factor.

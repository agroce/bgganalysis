RATING: 6.2
Initial rating, based in playing a single 3 player game. 

The game reminds me a bit of Citadels in the amount of luck and overall ratio of meaningful actions / targetting other players / trying to secondguess the choices of other players (combined with the theme, of course). 

My rating could still go up (if playing with more players indeed turns out to be significantly better), or down (if the number of worthwhile strategies turn out to be as limited as I halfway fear, and the luck factor with getting specific cards determines most of the success of these strategies).

I didn't expect to enjoy this, but it wasn't at all what I expected.  Despite the large amount of "blind bidding", there is definitely scope to have a plan, and the mechanics are sufficiently different to make it very enjoyable.

Fun little game! Pick "spells" from your own book, which are then resolved in numerical order. You are trying to collect people for special powers and VP's as well as items. Great game for children also as it teaches the doublethink (ie: The Princess Bride) mechanic. Works best with 2, IMO.

This was an interesting game that I honestly knew nothing about before playing. The gameplay is very straightforward which I appreciated. As a 2-player it felt rather strategic, and there were a lot of different roads to victory. I'll be interested to see how that translates to the multiplayer game. In a way the interaction of the roles made it feel like I was playing a Bruno Faidutti game, which is a good thing in my opinion. However the gimmick of the spell books didn't work that well for me. While the idea is cute it leads to some issues. For one thing, players have to read and re-read the spells all the time, and risk forgetting about a key spell later in the game. This can slow things down as people have to remind themselves what is available. Also if you have a dishonest player it would be remarkably easy for someone to watch roughly where in the book a player is playing their bookmark and base their decisions on that. I'd play again, but it didn't strike me as a great game.

I can see there is a good, second-guessing game here, but I am struggling to analyse it having been so comprehensively out-guessed in my first play.

However, I saw enough to realise it was worth playing again.

I thought I could like Grimoria: after all it’s a game of competing wizards like the ever-excellent Wiz-War. Sadly though, unlike the latter, this isn’t a fun game but an euro in disguise and as such it tries hard to hamper your playing.

Take the spells selection: there’s no «blast your opponent» spell, which would have greatly improved this game by making direct conflict much more direct and bloody, only «be content with what you get» cantrips, which means performing actions whose outcomes are only halfway satisfying, as in your typical euro.

All in all, Grimoria isn’t a bad game, if you like this kind of boredom: it surely doesn’t suit my taste though.

Nice filler - fresh feeling design which plays quickly and well.  I particularly like the spellbooks and the increased options open to you with each turn; snowballing the game to a quick but satisfying end. Despite being twice the size, the 'English language edition' doesn't improve much on the original, other than adding a board, with the other elements being pretty much identical.

Finally succumbed to Tanga w/ free shipping. Was it worth it? Maybe. Probably not. It's a simultaneous selection game. Sometimes you want to collide with others, but usually you don't. As the game progresses, the options grow. It felt a little long for what it was. I'll probably try again, but I suspect it will be hard to get beyond two plays in my group. I.e. probably wasn't worth it.

Components: The spell books are thematically interesting, but are more difficult to use than would be a stack of action cards that increases in size as the game progresses. There is a lot of text on the various companion cards, making it difficult to look around the table to see what each player's powers are, and what strategy they might be pursuing. I didn't particularly care for the art.

Experience: I'm not against blind bidding on principle, but I dislike it here. The various spells seem mostly unrelated to any particular strategy, making it difficult to predict what other players will select; therefore, this serves simply as a randomizer for turn order, and, at times, whether I can even use my spell or not.

I like that I will win a card regardless of turn order or whether my spell was canceled, but the unpredictable turn order, face-down card, and face down item deck add a lot of randomness to which cards I collect. There are ways to target players, but not necessarily to know that I am targeting the player in the lead. Not particularly interesting.

Really fun bluff and outguess game in the same vein as Citadels. This one's much less subtle than Citadels and allows more direct player interaction and attacks. It also focuses on set-collecting as in Citadels, but offers more options and strategies. Also, having a tiny spellbook and using it to choose your action for the turn is thematic and fun. I like it as much or more than Citadels depending on my mood.

Players are wizards, duelling their opponents, and trying to earn victory points.  Cute Japanese design.  Players pick up their tiny book of 15 spells, and insert a bookmark card at the page of the spell they want to cast.  Each spell is numbered 1 to 15.  Spells are revealed and player order determined, with uniquely chosen spells trumping spells chosen by more than one player.  In turn order, players can draft an item off the display - either a treasure or a follower, and apply the effect of their spell.  The spell effects vary, from grabbing VP tokens to poaching points and followers off the other players.  The game ends when a player has amassed ten followers or coins, and final points are tallied.  This is a fun, fairly quick game - probably too long to be a genuine filler, and a bit too chaotic to be a serious strategy game.  Worth a play or two, but feels very Japanese, sitting awkwardly between chaos and strategy.

RATING: 6.5
Tried this once with 2 players and it was fun and easy to learn. We only messed up one rule which was how the rogue worked.  However I think this game will be more fun with 3 or 4 so I'm going to wait to try that before rating it.

Update: Had a chance to try it with 4, it was fun, and everyone enjoyed it.  Solid game.  The only real issue is the tiny size and type of font that was chosen, it makes the cards really difficult to read.

Update 2: The new Z-man version is much easier to read and has better component quality.  And it expands the game to 5 players!

Update 3: Tried it with 3 players, and there were many times when the timing came out fairly random due to accidentally picking the same spell as someone else. It is a bit hard to control the outcome if you can't guess what your opponents will pick. I can't decide what to think of this, because in some ways you want enough players for their to be some collision, as it's one of the main mechanics of the game, but on the other hand, the more collision there is, the less control you feel you have over winning and losing.

The game struck me as a title that RPG players would really enjoy. The theme of this game is pervasive though the components, rules, spells, and art. Of these games that appeal to RPG players (Munchkin comes to mind), Grimoire is clearly better than most. For me it was a decent simultaneous action game.

Graphic and Design are wonderful, I love the little Spellbooks included in the game, but still after re-working the game-design "different ending" in the new 2012 edition, think two new spells as well and some new cards, there is a lack in game-design. Some spells you will never use, a concentration on a few... we had some fun in the first game but we don't think we'll play this again... lack of replayability... It's a pity for such a pretty game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Really simple simultaneous action selection game where you are second guessing what 'spell' your opponents are likely to play and what initiative it will be, smaller spells are faster but likely yield less points, large spell are powerful but slow. Player interaction comes in the form of offensive spells, counter spells and defensive spells.
Initiative also dictates what order players pick from the available cards for that turn therefore sometimes it is more advantageous to have a tiny spell and first pick. 

I thought first to 10 companions/treasure would be awfully low however the game felt just the right length, but I can see how a race tactic could be employed to speed up the game.

Nothing particularly new or special here but an enjoyable diversion on occasion.

Sold in 2015.

RATING: 1
This was awful.  

The theme just doesn't work with what you're doing.  This was like Lords of Waterdeep but without the board.  You aren't actually going on quests or finding treasure or casting spells, you're just picking a spell and then taking some tokens or a card from someone else.  Like a Feld game, you always get a quest card at the end.  I wish you would have had a choice between either going on a quest, or casting a spell on other players.

While the spellbook was a little fun, in a 3-player game, half the spells were never used.  In addition, there was way too much repetition among the cards so the guy that ended up winning was simply able to grab 2 of the 3 Kings which give a pretty big boost to endgame score.  It would have been better if there were more varied people to add to your party.  The cards themselves were also just boring, you get an extra token for going first or last, or you get some bonus tokens for having Z.

One player was able to use a Merchant/Archer/Thief combo with spell 7 to grab 2 items every turn, and ended up with just about every item in the pile.

In our game, we didn't do too much attacking against other players because it always seemed like that would put you behind because you could do other things to get cards or tokens.

Nagyon szép design, jópofa játékmenet, amiben semmi világmegváltó nincs, de szórakoztató. Varázslóként követőket és kincseket gyűjtünk, nomeg varázslatokat sütünk el. Talán ez tetszett a legjobban, hogy a varázslatok kiválasztása egy kis varázskönyvből történik, egy könyvjelzővel. Amúgy az egész nagyon egyben van tematikusan, designban, és nem akar többnek tűnni annál, mint amennyi. Kicsit több mint egy filler, de nem nevezném teljes értékű játéknak sem. Valahol a kettő között.

Grimoire scratches the same itch as Citadels but fortunately fixes the most egregious issues of that game. It still involves a good amount of take that but the penalties for those it is targeted at aren't quite as harsh, turns play a lot quicker and, perhaps most importantly, the game ends after a fixed number of turns.

RATING: 5
The game is OK you have to assess how the other players will act and have to adapt to the (person-)cards in play. But it fails to excite me. Perhaps there are too many options your opponents can choose to really predict anything and too few posibilities to bring your money and your persons in safety.

RATING: 7
An interesting game where you are trying to read your other opponents plays to determine what you can play most successfully. Lots of fun, although the rulebook is economically produced and the game suffers for it. This is a game that I found more compelling as I thought about it after my first play.

Very interesting little Japanese card game.  Combines the action selection/variable powers mechanic from Citadels with the card drafting mechanic from Fairy Tales.  I think the spell books are a neat little gimmick.  The games is bi-lingual (Japanese and English), Still, I hope this gets a full English release like the other good Japanese games that have hit the market recently.

Very pleasantly surprised by this one. This is one of the few games I think deserves a higher rating than it gets. The spell book is a gimmick without feeling gimmicky. The progressive nature of the spells works. The card selection mechanic is simple and meaningful. Overall, a nice addition into the role selection category. Feels a little like Citadels in that way but quite a different game. Similarly, the spells (roles) interact with each other in interesting ways and also reveal new insights into the 'Companions' that also form part of the game. Can't say I have any complaints here, other than I lost!

Filler.
You have to choose what spell you will take. You can use stronger spells, but they will go off later, less powerful spells will give you a chance to choose the item earlier. However you also have to be wary of opponents reversing the order, targeting you with attacks, and of course double reversing order. Also if you choose same spell as opponent, you both go to the back of the line.

Interesting little card game with a risk/reward mechanism. Your opponents could block you if you go for Forbidden Spells that give you extra VPs. However, an opponent could try to prevent a Forbidden Spell from being cast for nothing if nobody picked one, thus 'wasting' a turn. Turn order can also be played with, etc. The Item Deck strategy seems a tad bit too strong, though, and it's impossible to counter, 
Overall, enjoyable.

Grimoire is a good game.  I like the spell selection phase where you try to guess what the other player will choose.  The lower the spell is, the earlier you'll play (and be able to take the card that you want) but the higher number spell are more powerful and can give you more points but the players that plays before can block it.

A bit too much luck driven due to how the cards may show up and hard to predict your fellow players actions. So much hazard and imponderability makes it hard to love the game. Also there are 15 different spells, but half of them you will never use (There are two protection spells, but one was enough. Treasure cards are worth 1 VP on average, why buying them for 1$ which is also worth 1VP at the end of the game? Money is the opposite of tight, I wished there more ways to spend it).  However the artwork and components are top notch (German third edition).

The spell books are cute. Like other simultaneous-action games where your success depends on choosing a different option from other players (e.g. Sneaks & Snitches), the fun level depends heavily on who you play with. And it depends on them in ways that are hard to predict without playing.

Didn't really work for me, though I might dig it out for another try someday.

Interesting concept - you have an actual spellbook to use.
The implementation is a little weird, however - playing it with 5 is utterly random. Was actually not bad with 3.

Would be considerably better with better spells - e.g. the Block Forbidden Spell effect is essentially useless.

Excellent little filler game - some randomness but selection mechanic to Citadels without the long game tagged on with 4-5 players.

Can be vicious, but there being more of each type of card guarantees that you will see enough of one type to make every strategy viable. Getting those cards on the other hand...

This game has a fantastic concept behind it but needs two things:

1) An expansion, where some numbers have different abilities.
2) Due to the curious choice of requiring cancel/defensive spells to activate in turn order, a secondary cancel spell other than 2 that could be used when time is reversed.

Really enjoyed this cheap, new addition to our collection, courtesy of a Tanga free ship day.  There is some challenge in guessing which spell your opponents will choose and then picking the spell that well best serve your agenda based on that, the cards you have, and the cards that come up.  Turns generally move quickly once you know the spells, making this a great family game.

RATING: 5
This really reminds me of Citadels a bit except everyone has access to each role (or in this case, spell).  

LIKES:

* Instructions are fairly clear, game is easy to learn and play within 5-10 minutes.
* As the game progresses, more spells become available giving players more options for their main action - this generally would seem to mean that less players choose the same action but not necessarily...
* If people choose the same action, they will choose last from the quest display (generally meaning less valuable or helpful cards) while those who chose unique actions scarf up the better cards.  
* Different strategies work within the companion cards that each person can pursue a viable, competitive track (or so it seems).  
* While there are cards that can allow you to steal companions from people, you can prevent this by choosing a defensive spell which then pushes the consequences to the next highest person - usually quite unexpectedly...
* Play mat of the Japon Brand version is just paper but it works just fine.  Heck, you don't even need a play mat.

DISLIKE:

* Card stock is super thin...
* Plays a little long for what it is although I expect familiarity would allow for this game to be played very quickly.

In Grimoria sind wir Hexen und Zauberer in Ausbildung ala Harry Potter.
In jeder Runde wählen die Spieler gleichzeitig einen verfügbaren Zauberspruch aus ihrem Zauberbuch aus und legen in die Seite ein Lesezeichen ein. Sobald alle fertig sind, markieren alle Spieler ihre Wahl auf dem Brett, dadurch wird die Spielerreihenfolge bestimmt. Spieler die Zauber gewählt haben, die sonst kein andere gewählt hat, kommen vor denen, die mehrere Speiler gewählt haben zum Zug. Durch die Zaubersprüche erhält man Geld, mehr Karten, greift Gegner an, wehrt Zauber ab, usw.
Jede Runde erhält jeder Spieler eine Karte aus der Auslage, die neue Fähigkeiten verleihen oder einfach nur Punkte einbringen. Jede Runde erhalten alle Spieler ausserdem einen neuen verfügbaren Spruch, wobei alle den gleichen Pool an Sprüchen haben.
Mir gefällt das Spiel ziemlich gut. Die Auswahl der Zauber hätte man auch mit einer verdeckten Karte aus der Hand machen können, aber durch dieses Wertige "Zauberbuch" fühlt es sich tatsächlich "cooler" an. Ich wollte mich auf Schwarzmagie spezialisieren, aber die wurde immer mal wieder geblockt und ich wurde durch Angriffszauber ausgeraubt, so dass ich am Ende als Letzter dastand. Dennoch spiele ich es gerne wieder.

Z-Man continues its trend of bringing weirdo Japanese games to America, which is a good thing, as it gave us Fairy Tale and Parade, two enjoyable card games. This one has an interesting premise behind it, but I think we were two few (I suspect you want 4 or 5 for it) and too tired (it was the last game at an all-day game convention) to really give it its due. The spell books are a cute little touch -- I think most companies would just give the players a deck of cards to pick from.

Referring to German Edition:
Excellent game, beautiful artwork, great material (hardcover spellbooks) and nice mechanics. Good mixture of luck and tactics make it a very fun family game. Because of the short playing-time also good as a filler.

In my opinion it's best with 3 or 4 players, with 5 players it's almost too chaotic for my taste. With only two players it plays a little bit different (like many games), but can still be fun.

Sadly it has not even got a recommendation of the SdJ-Jury.

Excellent illustrations and cute little grimoires for the 'spell' actions you secretely pick every round are certainly enticing. The game itself is very probably good. I can’t tell for sure, since I’ve only played a single two-player game, where a lot of the fun is missing. Hopefully, we’ll get to play this with a bigger group quite soon, because the basic idea of trading an earlier choice of rewards for more powerful actions seems to be very well implemented here.

Chaotic fun that can be done within 45 minutes. Great with 4 or 5 players, and everyone has a blast trying to figure out who goes first and how the spells interact with each other. Better than Citadels in that getting screwed doesn't really ruin the entire turn, also turns are faster and there's less downtime. Also I've found less AP when picking spells as opposed to the character draft.

Neat game. It's a very quirky blend of second-guessing your opponents while having a decent set collection mechanism with some card-given powers.

It is a nice, fun simultaneous action selection game. Some of the tricks and abilities that pop up make the game interesting between plays. Definitely a filler.

Another great party/strategy game that seems to be in the same vein of Witches Brew.  Every turn another spell becomes available to use, but you might not want to grab it, as if you grab the same action as another player you will receive a penalty.

It's a fun game but it doesn't scale well since the card pool is the same regardless of the number of players, the number of cards drawn however is not the same. So playing a two player game is much less prone to create multiplying effects than a 5-player game. I will try remove cards from the deck to optimise for a 2-player game and see how it works. I might even entirely remove some characters form the game entirely.

It's a great game though if you play 4+ players.

- Two pages of rules make this a breeze to learn and easy to explain. Excellent stuff here.

The idea of having your own spellbook and "fighting" against other wizards was a great one, but i found the spells to be very uninspired, when you play a fireball and the outcome is that you just get vp tokens, there's really something missing. I'm not the biggest theme fan, but this game really needed it more!

Still, the game has good choices to make, and it has a good amount of strategy, but in my opinion it's more complex and less thematic than what it should be.

Light card game, where all players choose a spell simultaneously, resolve in turn order and pick a card. I like this game a lot, as it resembles [thing=478]Citadels[/thing]: you try to predict what spells will be chosen by others and get the most out of your choice. Pick a low spell to grab that card? Protect yourself or probably attack? Grab a treasure, but risk picking a worthless bronze helmet? Many options in a light card game.

Grimoire is a role-selection game with similarities to Citadels and Witch's Brew. The gimmick is that instead of selecting a role from a set of cards, you do it by inserting a bookmark into the relevant page of your 'spell book'. I quite enjoyed it, though one of the cards in particular seemed a bit unbalanced (the King).

RATING: 7
Secret action selection which determines (a) what special power you're allowed to do and (b) turn order during the card drafting phase.

With each round, players are allowed to choose from a greater variety of actions. However, this does not make the game more chaotic because the new actions become progressively more and more powerful. 

To me, simultaneous action selection games only work if players have a small set of actions from which to pick. Grimoire is clever in that it offers players a lot of actions from which to select, but only a few of them are worth picking each round.

Choosing spells can be tense and there is always the out guess your opponent aspect but choosing spells can really be challenging as you may want a card on the board and so you have to weigh how basic  spell you need to cast to still go first.  Really enjoyed the out guess your opponent aspect.  Great under the radar 30 min game.

I added this to an online order to qualify for free shipping, and thus basically got it for "less than free".  Therefore, I only glanced at a few reviews before grabbing it, making it the least-researched game I have bought, I think.  I have played once, and was not particularly impressed, though not terribly disappointed either.  It is an action selection game in which you need to predict what your opponents will do, with a cool little book of spells dictating the possible actions.  The flaw seemed to be that there were some obvious, safe actions to choose at most points in the game, making it feel a bit trivial.  There could be more to the game, however, and I will play it again at some point.

My group was surprised when first playing this little magical game about sorcerers and their spells. It made much more fun than we had expected. The game components, especially the small books, are brilliant. And there are many ways to victory: whether you collect coins, companions or landscapes.
I like it more in comparison to the game "Libertalia" because it's played faster and more intuitive and simply has more charme to me. Also the simultaneous spell selection is a big plus point.

Pretty neat. Simultaneous action selection (casting spells). Start with a choice from 6 spells, and gradually go up to 15, but you use a bookmark to choose the spell you cast in your booklet of spells, so[floatright][imageid=755601][/floatright] you don't have to keep track of 15 action cards. Excellent design in the presentation there. 

Lower-numbered spells are weaker, but allow you to go earlier in turn order to draft tiles for points (insert generic Eurogame scoring system). But play the same spell as somebody else, and you're last. Or try to go early/late, and somebody can cast a time-reversal spell to reverse turn order and completely screw you over. Prepare for that, and you're screwed again if two people each cast a time-reversal spell. Lots of double-think. 

A high point of the [listitem=1278075]Duel/Comparison genre[/listitem]. I keep thinking this is Fairy Tale on steroids, for it cut out a boring mechanism ([listitem=1334441]card drafting[/listitem]; instead, [listitem=1335588]tile drafting[/listitem] is used in Grimoire) and perfected the simultaneous action selection. Same genre, but different mechanisms, and the ones in Grimoire are more interesting and fit the genre better.

Remains to be seen if the Generic Euro Scoring System 101 holds up after the novelty of spell-casting wears off, but all card fillers are one-trick ponies anyway. Grimoire's trick is nifty.

Again rating a game way too long after I played it. I can barely remember the spellbooks, which are a nice gimmick but still a gimmick. Other than that, the game did not leave much impression, neither negative nor positive. It's one of those simultaneously-guess-what-the-others-will-do games.

I didn't realize the spells would be so abstract-feeling (e.g., Fireball gives you 2 VP, rather than, you know, blasting someone).

Only played once 3p so far. I think it would be more fun with a 4-5p so there's more interaction of the spells, more people picking the same spell, etc.

This is a fun little card game with an interesting mechanism. The spell books add an interesting twist to the game in determining your special action for the turn, as well as turn order. your options are straightforward and they are given in increments which adds a nice build-up to the game. The game is simple, which is good for teaching the game, and I could definitely see using this one as a gateway game. I look forward to playing this more.

Hidden role selection game, with a lot more than just outguessing the other players going on. Choice of spells can earn you VP, swap turn order, mess up other players, steal things - all sorts of stuff! And then you gather cards with lots of abilities. Unlike most hidden role games, it plays pretty well with just 2 players.

What a fantastic game.  It's sort of a simultaneous role-selection game/blind bid game which is augmented by getting cards that reward you for certain actions.  It's very simple, but the interaction between the players is what makes it really tick.

I'm thinking this game is best at the max player count of 5.  I'll bet that's the only way to get real interaction because with less it may be too easy to dodge each other.

Grimoire is a cute little game where blind bidding takes the form of numbered spells from a spell book, which workes quite well and may even appeal to folks who tipically don't like blind bidding. The box says 2-4, players, but realistically Grimoire must be played with four to really work. It's nearly broken with just two players. That's because the balance of the game is supposed to be deciding whether to use a high-numbered, powerful spell vs. picking a low-numbered spell that will allow you to pick goodies earlier in the round and possibly cancel the powerful spells. The balance of this dynamic is way off with two players. That aside, Grimoire smoothly integrates theme with mechanics and has a fairly simple, clean design. I didn't find the game overly exciting, but there are some interesting things happening here and my guess is that Grimoire, with its cute little spellbooks, will attracte more than a few fans.

It seems like the spellbook idea may not be fully developed, because you get penalized for taking the same action as somebody else but there are so many actions available that it comes down to pure chance. There's also a pretty high level of luck of the draw. Other than that the game is fun enough to play from time to time.

Very good game to introduce non gamers to player powers and timing-intensive mechanics. Starts simple and grows in complexity as more and more slots/spells become available in everyone's grimoires each turn!

The spellbook is really neat. The penalty for matching isn't as extreme as in, say, Witches' Brew, but it still adds a fun little layer of psychology. Its simplicity is nice, as is the ability to make cool combos with companions. Check out my full review: http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/690736/grimoire-outthink-to-outplay-to-outscore

I like the mechanic of the Magic book. Kind of random results though, not knowing what other players select each turn. Still, everyone seemed to like it. It is kind of cool, and I'd be happy to play this whenever the opportunity arises.

The guessing and engine building of this game reminded me a lot of Greedy Kingdoms. I really feel that you if like one of these titles, it is very likely that you will like the other as well. The big difference is, that Greedy Kingdoms can only be played with two players, while Grimoire should really only be played with four. Like GK, the artwork on the cards is very nice, but the quality of its components (what is up with the paper board?) could be a lot better. Also, I think I like Greedy Kingdoms a LITTLE bit better, because it allows for more educated guesses. Glad to own this though!

I really got this more for Rob, thinking that he would like it. It reminds me a little of Citadels, a game that I really enjoy, and I love the theme to this one, too. But after a few plays, I realized that I just wanted to play Mage Wars instead.

The game contains 4 spellbooks and bookmarks and many variety of cards and VP chips.
\13\\13\
Every turn, several cards are set up in the field. Then players secretly plot which spell he cast by using spellbook and bookmark. In the spellbook, the spells are written in ascending order. Basically they become stronger with the number increased. On the other hand, the order who get one card from the field is determined by spell number order. If you cast a smaller numbered spell, the spell effect is weak, but you can select one card earlier than other players.
\13\\13\
Also, there are 2 types of field cards. The first one is coin cards which are direct victory points. The second is character cards which gives you a bonus at the game end when some condition are met. The play ends when one player collects 10 characters or 10 treasure cards.
\13\\13\
There are direct attacking spell and defending spell, also tricky time spell which make the playing order upside down.

Neat little game with great components, I really enjoy those books to choose the spells from. The gameplay feels good and lets you do something useful every single turn. Nice aspect of trying to outthink the other players and react to their probable spell choices.

The 'halve a targets vp token' spell is overpowered. It can spoil the strategy of the person who is going the '5vp for each 5vp tokens strategy. Else that person has to turtle the way thru the game by taking the 'prevent illusion magic spell'

Then again, only played once. I think it would play better with the fixed turn ending new rules.

Edit - Looks like i have been playing it wrong. Upped score

Originally got this Japanese game for the JRPG style artwork, but found it was a really original and fun game. Players simultaneously choose spells to cast from their spell books (a really nice mechanic) which influence the game in subtle ways. The object is to collect victory points trough items, followers and VP chips. Very quick to play.

[Might get down - maybe there is an unstoppable strategy f you manage to get some key cards early]

An abstract game that camouflages as thematic game. There are no spell names in the german edition, and you don't need them.

I had written this off as a gimmick game... and the spellbook is quite gimmicky... but the actual game play is quite good!  There are a number of solid card combinations to rack up points and trying to manipulate your turn order position with clever spell play is interesting (if frustrating at times...).  I'll need a couple more plays to really solidify my rating.

Though something I've noticed in my first couple of plays is that though I'm terrible at choosing the right spell to get the turn order I want I am quite competitive in the game... I'm not sure what that means yet.

Neat!  Put your bookmark in a book of "spells" and then everyone reveals which spell they chose at the same time. Gain points, mess with the leading opponent, reverse the turn order, or protect yourself against douchebaggery. Great little filler.

Simultaneous action selection for 4 players. This boasts 2–4, but it's really only playable on 4 (maybe also 3). Players collect - in turn - one of a bunch of face-up cards worth points or having some boon, and the game ends when someone has 10 cards of one type (there are 2 types). The trick is that the turn order is decided by what action (spell) you select, and this spell can be anything from simply gaining a Victory Point, or stealing from someone else, or paying a VP to get a random discard, defend yourself from attack spells, and so on. The interaction starts to shine on 4 players.

Beautiful, beautiful components. As I believe this game starts on 4 players, having a fifth is wonderful. That the grimoires are real hard-cover books doesn't make the game worse. The added card do actually improve the game. Very well developped. Bravo, Schmidt Spiele!

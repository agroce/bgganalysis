A pesar de su antigüedad refleja bien la Batalla de las Ardenas.
Para evitar complicaciones innecesarias y dar más rapidez a la partida he reformado algunos aspectos como la artillería, puentes o resultados de la tabla de combate.
Ejemplo de cómo se editaban los wargames hace años que, por desgracia y a pesar de los adelantos actuales, no se hace ahora.
Recomendable para disputar todo un clásico.

RATING: 7
Bulge on roads.

A standard hex and counter game that leans heavily on an expanded CRT. At low odds, the game is bloodless and just dislodge defenders to another hex. Even at higher odds, the system promotes encirclement to kill units.

The road network and supply needs means a bulge battle that snakes along roads and intersections. Defenders putting their ZOCs into all the major road junctions where possible.

With average die rolls, the Germans have a pretty good early chances to breakout and grab victory city hexes. The thoughts of fuel is usually not of great concern in the early game. Once the tide turns, the Germans brace themselves for a defensive static warfare. Again, the concern of fuel becomes less apparent to maneuver warfare.

Strange way to play bulge, but Definately a fun game that provides attacking and defending options to both players, in a CRT environment.

Average game but considered great for its time.

One of the classic hex/counter wargames, still can be fun to play

RATING: 7.5
Quite easy and strait forward. (Hex and counter). It has some interesting features like the German captured Sherman's entering play the second turn that don't need to stop in enemy Zoc.
Or the English native speaking germans that move the road sign to delay the Allied advance.
The parachute variant is not worth the bother.
I enjoy playing it.

This is for the '81 version (AH)
Good operational wargame with standard rules. What makes it great?
Historical push by the Germans and the US can counter in the second part of the game. Both players can be offensive
Both breakthroughs and stalemates (around cities) are present. Good chrome and easier play than other "Bulge games". In fact the wargame made me come back twice to playing the "real" wargames. Once in 1987 and in 2002. Good solitair game (both sides can attack but at different times).
Makes you read about the battle and that's always a good sign for a wargame. Map is quite attractive.
One remark: the original version from the 60's is not very good and the Smithsonian edition from the 90's is one big ZERO.

You can feel the frustration of the German commander as your progress is slowed by the battle rages combat result in battle after battle. You can see your goal just within reach.  As the American commander, you can feel the desparation as you pray for the battle rages result.  You can't win many battles, all you can do is slow them down long enough.  If you over commit, it gives the German commander a huge incentive to throw in all of his big units in an attempt to eliminate a large chunk of your force and thus put gaps in the line.  A good game.

best of all 3 A&H BOTB games.  but one thing i've noticed with all bulge games, no matter which publisher, none of the games have a scenario for a drive on antwerp? usually they call it a german win if they get across the meuse river. so does that mean nothing stands in the way from there on? is not the objective of autumn mist is to make it for antwerp? so someone should make an expansion to complete this game.

Classic game - itself an update of the Original Battle of the Bulge game which was also a classic. Happy to play either one. Good playbalance, tense situation.

I read in a thread on here some time ago that there are more games about the Battle of the Bulge than any other battle. So if I was to claim this is the best, it would be very hard to justfy as I have only played a few. But I will say it's the best Bulge game I have played, make of that what you may.

This game is a second generation Avalon Hill classic. It has a fairly simple game structure with just enough chrome to make it interesting and suitable for it's subject. 

If you don't have time to try all the Bulge games, you could do far worse than try this one.

Avalon Hill had an opportunity to re-vamp an old classic, and they dropped the ball, or in this case the artillery round.  The game reads well and looks good, but when you begin to play the artillery is way out of proportion to its actual value.  Never finished a game.

When you lay out the mounted mapboard and look over all the forested Ardenness region, you really get a sense of being there, wanting to give a quick go and enjoy the time.  Given the territorial victory objectives, the German pushed for a significant breakthrough at some of the weaker Allied positions in a dead race towards Meuse river and the cities along the river, Liege and Antwerp.  Soon, however, you see that the Allied player make use of the engagement combat result pinning down the German.  Being prohibited to retreat by the combat result, the German has to send in more and more troops to reinforce the position in an attempt to raise the odds of combat. Sadly, the numerous engagment result on the columns of CRT still calls for another engagement result at a new odd.  The game soon boils down to a point that no German units are spare to move along other routes of advance to achieve "that" victory conditions.  As a result, no battle of the Bulge was able to be conducted as no bulge can be formed...The game design is limited by the designers' vision of the battle and the available simulation techniques at the time.  It was quickly dispensed under my bed and became a dust-collector.

This game produces a lot of tension for both sides.  The way retreats and losses and especially the engages work in the combat results table just keeps the players on edge.  And the four possible victory conditions will keep you interested the whole time.

RATING: 6
Updates the late "Classic" game system with new maps, counters, and terrain effects. Units usually have to stop and fight if they move adjacent to enemy units, but "engaged" units are an exception.

Much bigger than the '91 version. Units generally represent brigades and regiments, rather than divisions, hexes represent 2 miles rather than 5, and turns represent 1/2 a day rather than 1 day.

The Americans will have a hard time defending forward, but they can fall back. The Germans will rarely get individual units through American lines, like Kampfgruppe Pieper, but they might break through and get entire divisions through.

The SS get special black counters. I think this is a bad standard.

For its time closer to an "8" but this isn't the mid-1980s anymore.  The components are bland.  The Germans are a bit over-rated (not the first Bulge game to do that, nor the last, however).

05/03/88 Received. AKA Battle of the Bulge '81. The board graphics are very dated. Yet they are also very clear. I've seen lots of newer, nicer maps, but terrain types often spill over into other hexes causing arguments. There are no doubts on this board.

The 3rd edition rules help this classic and it's still fun to take out every so often.  Once you get past the first few turns which have all the special rules, the game plays pretty fast.  However, this is one of those games where you can usually see it's over one way or the other quite a few turns before the end of the game.

This game was one of my first wargames (along with The Russian Campaign, Squad Leader and OGRE(!)).  Plays very well solitaire... quite a good game that allows both sides to attack and defend.

Even now many years later, I still consider BB'81 a solid wargame (worth owning and playing) with a "classic" wargame feel, but somewhat overshadowed by newer Bulge designs (Ardennes'44, Bitter Woods, Enemy Action:  Ardennes).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
This game was the next logical step up from the old version Of Battle Of The Bulge (1965). Far more accuracy & better mapboard graphics in comparison with the previous version. Better rules, plus inclusion of artillery, airpower, better combat results table, weather table & good optional rules & so on. For it's time I would have rated this game a 10/10. Still worth keeping it in my collection. this game is far better played with updated rulebooks only with optional rules. Once you learn & master this game, forget it.....move onto Bitter Woods.

After purchasing a complete used copy in January of 2013, I must say that I'm very glad to have a version of this game back in my collection (have owned the 1965 and 1991 versions), especially this particular edition.

A "7" was my initial rating while playing the basic version, with some variants and advanced rules thrown in. After playing the basic scenario again in early 2015 I bumped my rating up to 8, as it's a very fun GAME to play (even though I have a master's degree in history I'm not anal about historical detail), effectively recreating the feel of the bulge the Germans carve out, hampered by the geography of rough ground, dense forest, multiple rivers, and choke points at bridge locations, plus resultant traffic jams. 

In addition, all the advanced or optional rules take together give it more layers of depth to game play. And, for the Allies, they have the challenge of deciding how to use limited forces and reinforcements to block German advances at key points, or fall back and realign at crucial junctures. 

Throughout it requires a lot of thought and consideration, but plays quickly--really a nice balance of both.

1981 Ed.  The Second Edition rules changes are a must (a few new counters were printed in the general, and I think later put into the boxes).

I think this is probably my all time sentimental favorite Bulge game.  It has its own foibles but it is fast and fun, and I still really dig the map and counters after all these years.

Not a bad game, but dated given a number of good treatments before and since.  The units being single step does not work for me.  Interesting Nebelwurfer mechanic, having very strong attack strengths but poor defense and movement -- I don't know if other games have anything similar, but in Bulge games I have played the Nebelwurfers are essentially like artillery.

This is one of my favourite Bulge games, and one I have played a lot. 

In my opinion the first edition is actually better balanced than the second, which I think was altered, strengthening the Americans and weakening the Germans, more to make up for inept American defensive play than for the alleged additional historical accuracy.

I own the 1965 version, which was heavily unbalanced in the German player's favor unless the Allied player was very experienced.  The optional rules which were supposed to restore balance weren't sufficient for that purpose.  Unit strengths didn't reflect the fact that U.S. divisions usually were overstrength while German divisions were understrength.

Untested. Gotta love 'em sleep-enducing old AH rulebooks. Also, too much concern for historical accuracy wrt scripted reinforcements/weather/etc for my taste.

Wanted to like this game, however its hard for the Germans to get much done as the CRT seems to be against them.  I essentially had the Germans making 4 attacks per turn, usually 2 getting a No contact result or engaged.  Adding up 60-80 combat factors and then getting a bland result half the time isn't very fun IMO.  The doubling for cities really helps the defender and putting them out of supply doesn't affect their defensive combat strength.  Don't see how the Germans can reach any of their auto victory objectives.

This is one of the best wargame designs I have owned and played, and I own hundreds of them.  Many have argued for certain rules changes, but when you study the designer's reasons for each rule, it is hard to argue against him.

A classic AH game, fun to play. The only downside is that it takes maybe a little bit to long to play.

Everyone likes this one. Most will cite the 81 version as the best of each edition.
Your basic original consim here. The graphics bland by todays standard. Fair overall

81 edition greatly improved and fixed problems with the 1965 edition. Much more interesting game, updated but still inaccurate order of battle, better CRT, more effective optional rules. must have replacement for the 1965 edition.

My second game. Blitzkrieg was the first. What I like the most about it is the fact that it is abstract and you can set up any way you want. There is no historical set up determining how the game is played. It is also quite easy to learn.

A very good game on its subject. Today you can find better simulations, though. Traded away when I got Hitler's Last Gamble.

Sólo he jugado a la 1ª Edición, pero tiene muchas cosas que no me han gustado. Algunas de ellas se corrigen en la 2ª, cuando la pruebe igual cambio de opinión.

This was a big improvement over AH's original Bulge game. The map is much more pleasing to look at, and many of the missing roads were found!

I really liked the ranged artillery fire capabilities. And the counters were given more color and better detail.

I wouldn't say this was a favorite at our club meetings. But it did get played fairly regular. It's still a good game for beginners. Sets up and plays fast and has only a limited amount of rules.

Simple and fun.Falls short of the competition, but what it lacks in details it makes up in ease of play.

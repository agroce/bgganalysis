Exciting, intuitive, luck-heavy, racing game. The mini edition rules keep the game moving fast, but simplify concepts of the bigger game a lot. The components in this edition are great. Nice double-sided board, nice gold chips for damage points. The central dice-as-gears concept in the Formula De series is ingenious. A lot of fun.

The mini edition can also be treated as an upgrade for the large Formula De. With a custom-made dashboard, you can do away with the pencil/paper pads from the bigger game, and instead use piles of chips from Mini to record your wear points. The extra dice from the mini edition speed up gameplay - there are more dice readily to hand. The gear-changer boards in the Mini-edition are nice, with the changeable rear-spoiler colours. The small maps in the Mini game give the option of a shorter game even using the main-game rules.

I will be recording all Formula De plays (from any edition) under the base game.

Great simple racing game. Probably one too many exceptions to the rules (boosting, collisions, slipstream, etc.) but a lot of fun to play. Very punishing if you get out of the "rhythm" of the course though. The two maps provided are also far too similar to each other.

Formule DÃ© Mini (Designer: Laurent Lavaur, Eric Randall, Publisher: Descartes Editeur)

Formule DÃ© Mini is a miniature version of the well-known car racing game which packs into a small box complete with numerous cars, gearboxes, coins for life tokens, and funny dice. The game is simplified with respect to the large versions, but the rules and double sided race track make the game ideal for kids and families. Pleyers start with a car and must move off using a 3-sided die rolling only one or two. On their next turn, they can move up a gear and take a new, 6 sided die rolling in the range 4-8 spaces. Next time, if they stioll wish to accelerate, they can take an 8 sided die rolling from 8 to 12...and so on up to 5th gear. The golden rule of the game however is to corrrectly manage each of the corners: players must stop somewhere within the official bend of teh track (which envelopes several spaces) or pay life points: runnign out of life points means crash and burn. Balancing risk of an overshoot on the bend against an over-conservative policy which will bring you home when the champagne grape juice is all drunk is key. Changing down too fast costs you life points, as does slipstreaming, over-revving motors, and collisions. 
This is great for both adults and kids. Kids love to roll dice and this game really appeals, especially to boys. Cut it down to one lap if it's time for bed! Vroom vroom!

RATING: 8
After one game I am really impressed,. The game system allows more flexibility of actions than FD and the game passes much quicker. The intruiging pit stop rules have an element of luck in them, but the prospect of a fast pitstop too. Minor things like the wing and body colours being interchageable and matching with a two part gear marker improve the ease of knowing what gear is used by each car.

The shorter course and simpler corners all add up to making the game more accessible. The worry is that another 20+ board may be produced in this style!

Quite fun racing game. Simplified version of Formula De that in some ways is oversimplified. We didn't play it right first time, as we didn't notice turn order is supposed to change each turn. Would try it again with the right group, but not burning to play again.

Traded away.

RATING: 7
I love the game, but I hate the pit stop rule.  It's kind of stupid that you can pit stop and not have to lose a turn.  In a real race, you pit and then have to catch up to others who don't.  The game also has a tendency to make catching up to an early leader hard as being freed from traffic early and that is immense.

RATING: 5.5
OK for a lighthearted passtime now and then. But the game is far too throw-of-the dice dependent - two players next to each other with identical choices could find one throwing well and just sneaking into the next corner whilst the other throws well and finds themselves just short of the corner and, basically, stuffed.

OK - I don't like race games unless there's another aspect to them, such as gambling. Regardless of the cleverness of the system there's nothing to keep me involved between turns.

RATING: 6
I'm a big fan of the real Formule Dé and after playing this game it hasn't changed. In the base version you have some controll over your car and you have to make tough decisions, here I had not to make any decisions and took a lot of risks. Those "risks" weren't mostly not very risky because of the big pile of life points. Going to the pitlane is also like going to the casino, very luck-based.
I tried this game to play with younger players, but then there are better racing games like Ave Caesar and Monza.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I bought this mainly for playing with my boys (6 and 4). We've been playing the regular Formula De and I thought this would be a bit easier for them. It turns out that I really like this game. The game length is better. There's less stuff to keep track of, so play is a bit smoother. I also like having the 2 lane track to make things a little more congested. Since the Formula De expansion boards are so difficult to get, this is also a nice way of providing some variety from just the base tracks. I think when we play with the regular Formula De, we might just use the mini rules.
The high rating (8) is mainly due to the fact that I love playing this with my kids (who love race cars). Without kids, I think the rating would be a little lower.

Components: Excellent.  Board is colorful with good art.  Nice car minis.  LP chips are kinda cheap, but work.

Theme:  Pretty Good. It looks like racing.  The mechanics fit.  But as for play, see Thoughts.

Mechanics: Below Average. They look good on paper.  Change gear, roll appopriate dice, lose points for screw ups.  Problem?  See Thoughts.

Thoughts: I haven't played the full version.  People said this one was scaled down and made for a better play.  I thought this version was boring.  Because all penalties come from the same life point pool, there's no reason to brake or over-rev, just over-shoot the turns and pay the penalty. Which turns this into nothing but a dice-fest.  We hadn't even got to the first pit stop when the 3 players cars had seperated to over half the course based on who was having the luckiest and unluckiest rolls.  We didn't finish the game.

Verdict: Didn't really like it.  Probably won't play again, at least without introducing some variants.

I don't think it's as good as it's big brother, but it's still a good game.  The points system versus specific points for tires, engine, etc, is still pretty decent but just a different mindset.  I do like the turbo boost and thinking of adding that to when I play the big game.  Also, because the track is smaller, it's a quicker game.  I can see using these small tracks with the regular rules, as well.

Weird, I so much prefer this to it's older/bigger brother. The 'life points' for everything speed up the game - and the luck factor doesn't seem to matter so much. If there were more tracks for this one the rating would be higher as racing on the same 2 loses its appeal quickly

The simplicity and speed of play of this makes it more attractive to me than it's big brother. Hairpin bends should be 2 stops though.

Later - the gloss has gone off this and it's big brother. It just seems to shaft you too often where you fall one square short, so you hit a corner in the "right" gear but get screwed by a bad dice roll. No longer feels like a racing simulation.

I felt like its daddy, Fomula De, just seems to last longer than the fun does.  FdMini does a great job of streamlining that system and leaving the good stuff.  You sacrifice a little detail and a lot of game time, but not at the expense of the decisions. Yes, its very luck-based, but there is some room to deliberately gamble or make strategic choices.

I&#039;ve wanted to try out Formula De for a while, so I broke down and picked up the mini version and tried it out against my friend.  My conservative racing style didn&#039;t get me first place, but I had a lot of fun.  The rules are definitely more streamlined, but they change the play, I think; the simple pool of chits lets you abuse the car (and thus the rules) a lot more, I suspect, than if you had allocated them to specific parts of the car.  With 20 generic points to blow anyway you liked, it suddenly becomes worthwhile to intentionally blow through a curve in fifth gear and accept the half-dozen LP cost than to drop gear and attempt a real corner.

Far superior to the full Formula Dé, in my opinion. An entire three-lap game takes about an hour (instead of two or three hours), and it's much more fast-paced than the full game.

A slightly simplified version of Formula De, in a half sized box.  There is a 2 laned canyon track, and a 3 laned island track.  Rules are very similar - differences include: no 6th gear, damage points are spent from a pool of common damage chips, turbo boost moves are possible, and pitting your car can hold you up for a long time!  Recommended if you don't own Formula De, or you do and want a "quick play" edition of the game.

I eventually realized that this is not a racing game - it's really a gambling "press your luck" game.  The rules variations suggested to add "realism" are laudable, but really subtract from the essence of the game.  Even the strange pit stop rules make sense when viewed in the context of a gambling game.  The game is good even with just 2 people, but I'd recommend each driver play 2 cars.  I haven't played the full Formula De, but I really don't think I'd like it as much.  Adding any more complexity or length would probably make the game too tedious for me, but I really enjoy the "mini" version.

Great presentation, smaller box, better price, and upwardly compatible with all the Formula De tracks. Why would anyone buy the big version? Great 4 or more, or 3 players with 2 cars each. Not very good with 2 players. [Traded for Elfenland.]

Excellent game.  But don't be too cautious.  Often it's the less cautious players that win ... especially if they have two cars (and the overly confident car crashes and the less confident one wins).  The only improvement to make was to add the 30-sided die for 6th gear, which I did.  I played this again today (12-31-2011) with Mr. Billington, using one of the two tracks that come with it (the one with the three-lane track), one lap only, and he won.  I like it better with the Formula De and Formula D tracks than with the two small ones that come with Formula De Mini.

Dé Mini is a slightly shorter and streamlined version of its big sibling. The rules changes are fairly small for the most part, and the only real change from the original beginner rules is that all damage is paid from a shared pool instead of individual car parts. The shorter playing time is mostly a result of shorter tracks, and the two included with the game are actually fairly dull and seem to reward rolling the right numbers much more than tactical manoeuvering. The island track, for example, could be run enirely in fifth gear. The weak tracks seem to be the greatest shortcoming to me since you could easily play with the big game rules for some more tactical options.

RATING: 8
Played with the mini rules on a full-sized board. It was very enjoyable and not too complex. The game moved very quickly once all the players became familiar with the rules. On second playing, I think the starting rules (1-4: miss a turn, 16-20:4 spaces + 1 gear) give too much of an advantage to players. Those who did not get a quick start never caught up (over 3 laps) to those who did. Mostly luck of the dice, but there is some strategy.

Played four times - and so far have enjoyed every play. A great, quick, fun, race game with just enough thinking and chance taking to make it enjoyable. It's actually a dice fest, but there are enough decisions to make you feel like you've done something when you win.

--Not sure I quite like this as much as its big brother, but there are PLENTY of ways to tweak this just a bit, or use Mini rules for Maxi, and vice versa.

I really don't like the fact that there is no limit for overshooting--there's a limit of 7 (!) for blocking but none that I see for overshooting.  This will probably be the first house rule I adopt, keeping it in line with the blocking rule.

Otherwise you just shoot through the curves late in the race like an idiot, something that will get you killed in Maxi.

EDIT:  Time has proven that this is a fun game, nice for families and lunch breaks at work, but it has some serious gameplay issues.  My houserule helps, but there is so much missing from this that's in the "big game" that it always feels flat playing this.

It is good for kids to play, though, who only have to worry about one type of damage, and it plays fast enough that their little minds aren't wandering.  Also, as I said, it's about the only race game with the exception of Formula One card game that will squeeze into a normal lunch hour.

Racing games with dice are not my favorite type. But Formula De Mini is a bit different. The randomness is big and you can't plan ahead but there is some tactics, there are some choices and there is fun. Plain and simple fun. And that's enough for me.

Not only is the race track smaller but the rules are simpler and these simpler rules can be used when playing Formula De full size.  Start with 20 points and deduct points for each thing that goes wrong.  You must have at least one point to cross the finish line.

RATING: 6
Quicker, streamlined version of Formula De (which I&#039;m not a big fan of) - but I like the Mini version. My house rule is - no counting of spaces with your fingers on the board during your turn. - It&#039;s a racing game...decisions are meant to be made quickly! Methodically counting the spots makes the game less tense, and reduces it to simply hoping to roll the best number.

Why I don't like it that much: I find it too mechanical: Switch to obvious gear, roll the dice, move. If too close to another car, roll dice, lose (in my case!).
Certainly a nice simulation of a F1 race, but hey, it just doesn't work for me.

RATING: 6
It's a quick and easy game that's all about how you manage your dice rolls. It's a challenge, and quick enough for the Lady and I to play while the kid's are asleep.
I'll be getting Formula D for sure, as this game's big brother is now out of print. A roll and move game that's actually strategic and fun. Get it if you can, and want a smaller, travel version racing game.

I actually like this game slightly more than it's progenitor. You give up a bit of depth but It plays faster than Formula De and I find the "life point" system cleaner than the equivalent systems in the full game. The mini tracks lack a bit for excitement (everything is a one stop corner), but they're good for a race or two, and then you can graduate to the full game (possibly taking the Mini rules with you to the larger tracks).

This is a good begginer version of Formula D, with slighly smaller track available (for 8 max) and chips to spend for wear points.  The advantage is less detail tracking and elimination of cars takes a little longer.  The downside is a loss of some of the game flavor.  

I definitely recommend this for lighter gamers, or for younger gamers who cannot complete Formula D 2 lap race in under 2 hours.

I've played the full scale version of this game but like the mini version much better.  It plays faster and I prefer the use of damage tokens instead of having to keep careful track of which goes first: my tires or my brakes.

RATING: 6
First played July 30th, 2008. Taught in 10min, played in about an hour. Each take a car and roll the black 20 sided dice. Lowest number starts first followed by next lowest number, etc. There are 5 dice representing gears. On your first roll, you start out in 1st gear and roll a yellow 4 sided dice which has 1-2. You move the number of spaces you roll. There are three lanes around the trace and there are more spaces around the outer edge of the curves. Each successive turn you can upshift or downshift 1 gear for free. You must end your turn inside a turn, otherwise you lose life points. If you stop next to someone you and they roll the black dice; 1-4 you lose two life points. Other dice: 2nd gear orange 6-sided dice with 2-4 on it; 3rd gear red 8-sided dice 4-8, 4th gear green 12-sided dice 7-12, 5th purple 20-sided dice 11-20. If you roll the top number in 4th or 5th gear everyone rolls the black dice; 1-4 losing 2 life points. You can also draft, by ending exactly right behind someone and then subsuquently moving in front of them. This is a fun little game worth a gameplay for those who know someone who has it.

Probably the best roll and move variant I've played.  This is a very fun race game with a bit of tactical thinking and a heavy dose of luck.  I found it to be enjoyable in the same way as pizza box football. They're both very fun dice chucking loose simulations of the sport that they emulate.

All the fun of Formula De and it fits in your backpack! To be fair the tracks for the full version are much more epic, and the advanced rules combined with the individual car stats make the full version more of a simulation. But since I am not interested in simulation, I find this gamey version of the game more to my liking.
And you can always play the mini rules on the full tracks.

A very dumbed down version of Formula De. Its the same race game, but all the different resources (gas, tyres, brakes) have been "mushed" into one resource. Component quality was good, but I thought the maps were pretty bland (it needed at least one 2-stop turn to make it interesting).

Long story short, I'd still prefer Formula De over this game.

I don't think the penalties are hard enough. Allthough my car had only 2 LP left and another one had none left. Want to play the regular version now.

If Formula De Mini was a car it would be a nice little hatchback to get you around town quickly - a small but reasonable engine (certainly faster than its predecessor), ok bodywork, quite nice to look at, carries four without too much of a squeeze and easy to find a space for.  But if you pimp the ride customise some of the rules, take some of the best bits from its big brother and add a bit of your own artwork then you have a game to shout about.

Formula De Mini is a basic (slightly flawed)race game looking for an owner who is willing to invest some time, love and energy.  Without some care and attention, a slight tweaking of rules, this game will just be a competition to see who can stay in 5th gear the longest and to see how far the leader can get away.

You roll the dice, you move the cars. That's really pretty much it. There are some extra mechanics added on to save the game from Parchesi-like levels of tedium, but I found that few of these ever came into play - there is simply never any call to enter the pit stops, for example, unless you've practically lost already. The more you get behind, the more risky moves you're inclined to make, which can often lead to a runaway leader problem, but also to some potentially dramatic reversals. A blandly soothing game, overall, that's probably best suited for pre-teens.

The true greatness about this game is how light it is. I've played complex racing games and simple racing games. There are a fair number of ways to lose your car's life points, but they do not feel cumbersome to remember after only one game play. Since always on the lookout for rules light games, this one definitely gets a thumbs up. I imagine racing games aren't for everyone, and the simplicity of this game probably does not appeal to all, but it has definitely moved up to be one of the best racing games in my collection.

If Formula Dé is a racing simulation, this is a simulation of an arcade game- it's not nearly as realistic as Formula Dé, but I think that it's more fun.  Easy to explain, but maintains the essence of its big brother without the bookkeeping.  Plus it is compatible with the tracks and components of the big game.  One of the nicest things about this (and big Formula Dé, too) is that it handles large groups well, as there are very few board games that play well with six or more.

Similar to the original but streamlined for faster play and uses chits to record damage, overshooting corners and excessive braking. For me not as good as the Senior game when played in a season as you can't tinker with your car set-up. Gives me the same feeling as playing a 1-off tabletop miniatures game - without the bigger picture of a campaign. I don't see the point but of course it plays faster so that will appeal to some and younger gamers.

I haven't played the original Formula De, but 3 hours for a 2 lap race seems like an atrocity to me, and an easy way to scare off possible opponents. 1 hour seems much more reasonable and the game is a lot of fun! It's a nice push your luck game with some nice dice and a excellent theme. My only complaints are the lack of more circuits. The double sided board comes with 2 circuits, but I weould appreciate having at least one more (preferably with 2-stop turns). But we always have a lot of fun with it and it's a nice opening game.

RATING: 6
Thankfully more streamlined than the strongly thematic original, as you no longer bookkeep your car's qualities: instead toss in gold chips if you brake harshly or overshoot the corner. If you can't cough up you spin out and back to 1st gear. Also you lose chips if you are involved in a collision and here I'm reminded of the wonder of the die mechanic: different gears give a different die to roll so a different range of numbers. So there is anticipatory tension in the hope you roll better or your oppenent comes up short; also there is tension and relief (or grief) if a 1-4 is rolled for a false start, collision or overrevved engine. Another plus is the shorter tracks so increasing the likelihood of the game not overstaying it's welcome. But it still fails as a race game as the game flow is still slow for newbies.

Dice done right. The decisions are simple, quick, and fun.

RATING: 5
Bit boring formula racing game. Doesn't represent real life too well, as with some luck you'll be zooming around the track at top gear through hairpin corners and such. Some houserules or full Formula De rules might help a bit, but I'd say basic box is only good for rolling the dice and moving the cars around, not anything more serious. Still, easy fun with kids. And 8 player games are always nice to have in closet, just in case...

If you have this, just print the Basic Rules of Formula D (the re-implementaion) as those are much cleaner and better. Formula De Mini with its own rulebook is only 7 or a 6 as the rules were clearly rushed and not playtested. And the rulebook was not proofread.

If possible, find yourself a 6th gear die (or just proxy with a D10, D20 or D30) but this is not a requirement. I enjoy playing championships through several races with my kids. I prefer playing on Formula De tracks.

I really enjoy this one.  Even though each move is determined by a die roll, I find that deciding which one to use isn't always so easy.  Quite often one die gives me a range too high and another too low.  This adds strategy and tension to the game.  It also plays in under an hour.

I've found that I always would prefer to be playing the non-mini version. It seems to come out to appease those who don't really like the length of Formula De. Funny though that those seem to be the same people who don't really care for the system to begin with. So then, what's the use of playing with them right?

Mini is a good game but the tracks and advanced rules of the "parent" make the latter a pretty great game. Why not just play it?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
--July2005-- Perhaps an overly random and trivial treatment of an automobile race.  It plays too slowly and deliberately for "fun", and it lacks the depth (held by its non-Mini sibling) that would make the pace worthwhile.  I think I'd rather just turn my brain (mostly) off and play Carabande.

I didn't think I was going to like this one as much as I did. I'm a diehard Formula De fan, but I will admit that this one is easier to teach then the full game, while still being enjoyable. Our first game had the 1st, 2nd and third place players all clearing the finish line with 1-3 LPs left and on the same turn. It was a race and a half! Give it a try.

RATING: 3
Obvious decisions dictated by wild dice roll swings. The racing isn't close enough to keep all players similarly entertained. It's a game for kids who can get into the theme, but if I was playing with them I'd pull out Pitchcar over this waste of time any any of the week.

Yes, but tell us how you really feel about it, why don't you.

Okay, I will: It's no fun at all. Just like real Formula One since the invention of carbon fibre brakes, slick aerodynamics and go-kart tracks for them to "race" (pave with money), on. Where did the fun go? James Hunt would be turning in his grave for the chance to grab the microphone off Murray Walker and tell you how he really feels. Because he can't I'll do it for you. This game is shite, just like the "sport" it's based on.

Even when it is almost the same game, this is way better than [i]Formula D[/i] because it doesn't add unnecesary complexity. Just what we came for: Roll the dice, feel the tension of a race and have fun.

RATING: 6
I got this for my 8 year for his birthday because he loves race cars.  He really likes this game a lot.  I was not sure if I would like it, as the roll and move element is key.  I have found that I really enjoy and look forward to playing it with the kids.  It is much more than a roll and move game.  The heart of what makes it interesting is combining a push your luck element with resource management.  Driving your car too hard and too fast can take you out of the game.  But if other people get ahead of you, you really have to take risks.  Plus it is fun just zooming along.  All of my kids (8, 10, and 5 - the 5 year old needs a little help) enjoy it.

This is probably not the sort of game I would pull out with adults, although I see how it could be fun with a lot of people in the right mood.

Another car racing game that does very little for me.  I love dice but that's all this really boils down to.  I don't really care for the mechanics of shifting gears and there doesn't seem to be a whole lot of strategy aside from blocking.  Not something I am eager to play again.

A fun little game, with some good approximations of the "feel" of driving a race car.  Most of our games so far have been pretty conserative, I need to try to "blow out" the track once and take some chances and see how that effects the gameplay.

I have only played the mini version.  I could see liking the larger version of this better.   From the description, it offers more decisions, and less reliance on dice rolls.  I had a fun enough time, but dice don't treat me well, as a result I don't love dice games as much.

Easy to explain, fun to play; much better than it's big brother ([gameid=173]). Same basic game but:
- shorter track

- more likely to have collision damage (1-4 on d20, vs. 1/20)

Hey, this has a sturdy mounted board that is a more manageable size!  I have not played this yet but the rules seem more streamlined than the original FD, while still allowing for lots of options (downshifting, braking, slipstreaming, going an extra space...).  I will probably change the pit rule though.

RATING: 7.5
Here is a fantastic racing game that captures all the excitement of Formula One racing (actually, it goes one better - it makes something exciting out of what is usually a fairly dull form of motor sport) with a very simple to learn and clever "gear dice" system.  It brilliantly captures the push-it-to-the-limit-without-going-over aspect of racing, and, unlike the real Formula One, many of our races have been quite close.  My major problems with the game are that most decisions that are made in the game are fairly obvious, there is a lot of tedious counting of spaces, there is not enough variety in the tracks that can be raced, and, while it's most interesting with more cars on the track, the play time runs a bit long with more cards.  My only complaint from a visual standpoint is that the strange, cartoonish graphics on the tracks are, well, strange.  I've never played the full version of "Formula De", and I have no desire to since I feel that having to keep track of so many other aspects would slow down the pace of the game, which is pretty much the opposite of what you want in a racing game.  However, I WOULD love to get hold of "Formula D"!  Game design: 4/5  Personal enjoyment: 3.5/5  Total: 7.5/10

RATING: 4
I find this to be inferior to original, as it's almost complete luck (where the original is probably 80% luck).  Even the pit lane is nearly 100% luck, which I find rather silly.  Apparently the pit crew is made up of bumbling idiots because it's possible to waste a turn in the pits and get zero wear points restored.  It's an ok game, but I guess when I'm in the mood for Formula De, I'd just go with the original game.

[Descartes Editeur 2002 edition] {racing; roll-and-move; optimal 5p} Basically, it is a streamlined version of Formula Dé. The rule is simpler by replacing wear points with life points. Player need not do the accounting work to check which parts of their car are damaged. With this rule, there are fewer things to consider but it may make the game more luck-driven because a player can choose all kinds of dangerous actions to try his luck by giving up life points, which is not possible in original game because a car part would have been damaged if he does so.

More tracks are needed to increase replayability and have more fun.

It's a pity that 6th Gear dice is not included but it can easily be supplemented by the dice set.

I think I would prefer the full Formula De.  You know what you're getting here, which is a lot of dice rolling and a few risk vs. reward decisions... and it probably would be a fun game to play over a few beers, but I wouldn't recommend buying unless your preference is for luck based games.

Scaling down and streamlining a game can sometimes improve it ... other times, not so much. The streamlined Formula De Mini rules introduce even greater luck to the game, and the scaled-down board makes movement fiddly. Formula De Mini is a step down from its big brother in just about all respects.

GAME: Talisman (Revised 4th Edition)
RANK: 1125
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
This (Fantasy Flight 4th edition) is a very beautiful game! I really want to give it a higher score but, let's face it, all you really do is role the dice and pick cards. There is almost no strategy involved. But, if you are looking for a mindless, fantasy themed game to play with the family this one is perfect for that!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Very thematic and very slow and rather random. I always start gradually losing interest after about three turns and after a few more I realise that there's three more hours to go... It's really not deserving the fame and cult status it has. Hate the roll and move mechanic. Will never play this again.

I had never played Talisman until this new (Black Industries) 4th edition. Read many things about it and was familiar with the basics of game play.
 
Pros: They did a beautiful job with the overall graphics. The board is attractive and a nice size plus lots of helpful text (when correct- more later). The 2-D character pieces are also very nice and I don't really mind them over 3-D plastic pieces (especially if not painted). The cards have nice images and readable text. The game play is pretty much what you'd expect from a game designed originally in the early 80's. There's definitely some player tension and I probably would have seen more tension had we all had some previous hands-on experience with the game.

Cons: Errors?  Yes, lots of errors. People are already pointing out incorrect character card text (Prophetess). There is at least one board printing error and possibly more depending on the ruling on the Village and City spaces. The rulebook is ill conceived so much so that it's hard to find answers to obvious questions. Yes, the little plastic pieces used to record Strength, Craft, and Life were also ill conceived. I'd probably take a paint pen to them and color the number so that it stood out at the very least. The cards (and box) are not "Euro-Quality" and Chinese printing (though probably cheaper) doesn't reach that same quality level.  Also, I would have expected a few more variant/optional rules included as the game has gone through several editions with lots of tweaks. 

Overall, the game still has a charm to it that is undeniable. Fixing some of the errors is an obvious first step. And I think a few advanced rules could kick the strategy quotient up a bit without doing any damage to the core game. 

**Update 1-8-09**

As I now have the new revised 4th edition by FFG and played a session, I've upped my overall rating. Mainly because of the following:

* They cleaned up the board, rules, and card language to make it more consistent. There's very few errors (only spotted one so far).

* I love the plastic minis as they lend a much nicer look to the game. I look forward to painting them. :)

* I like the little cones for the craft, strength, and life tokens. Much easier to pick up and count.

* I think the Fate tokens are a very good addition to the system. This addition helps to balance some of the bad luck that players sometimes get in spades.

The game can still run long but it is a fun adventure game experience. This is a true board game classic.

A lot like fantasy Monopoly.  Picked this up hoping to get my Molly to play more games.  She's not a gamer, but loves her some Monopoly.  The more I play it, the more I like it.  A lot of randomness to the game, but also several ways to mitigate or second chance a bad roll.

Chaotic, crazy, fantasy-themed fun! This new edition looks really nice, with the cool gold coins, awesome board and card art, and little plastic pieces for stats (I'm just using all of them for '1'). Great "experience" game with little downtime and lots of variety. Also, the gameplay is light enough that pretty much anyone can join in and have fun.

At first glance, there doesn't seem to be much choice or opportunity for strategy (just roll a die, move that many, draw a card and do what it says), but there's a bit more decision making than people give it credit for. You feel like you are both choosing your own adventure and simply going along with the story. Still, there isn't [i]a lot[/i] of strategy here, and this is a nice game to play when you want some light fun after a long day. (I wrote more about the important decisions you make during the game here: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/438714)

Fate is a nice addition to the game. It cuts down on play time and frustration from unlucky die rolls, plus it sort of balances the characters (characters with crappy abilities get more fate).

Wow, my rating for this game continues to increase as I play it more and more. This game is ALL KINDS OF AWESOME.

Player interaction: race, take-that, dice based combat.

Themes: adventure, there can be only one, fantasy quest.

Components: Art ranges from conventional (cards) to ugly (board). Plastic components are nice.

A game where anything can happen.  This is sword and sorcery pulp fiction in board game form.  Though the rules are simple you never know what random monster is going to show up around the next bend.  There is a general structure to the flow of the game.  Players strive to become strong enough to enter the center of the board and kill their opponents.  The board is divided into various regions and each have their own feel.  This heightens the joy of exploration and provides the players with strategic direction.

Talisman is the best adventure game designed so far and the FFG printing is the best version.  (I do wish FFG would get their artists to redo the board.  The Black Industries art is bland.  And now that I've seen Relic, I'm even more interested in an update to the Talisman board.)

I quite like Talisman, probably because of nostalgia value and playing in high school. Most recently found out we were playing it wrong, else the rating would be much lower. The expansions add some new twists to the game and make it more accessible for having more players (less clustering on the outer region).

RATING: 3
Very rarely, a few times in a lifetime, you play a game and when you finish it nothing can ever be the same. Walls have been pulled down, barriers broken, a dimension of feeling, of existence itself, has opened in you that was not there before. Talisman is a game of this magnitude. John Goodenough may be the most gifted designer in the industry; gifted not just because of his imagination, his energy, his originality, but because he has access to the unutterable, because he can look inside a person and discover the unique essence of his humanity. For years he has been designing games about what it means to defend this essence, this unique light, against a world designed to extinguish it. Talisman is his most powerful, shattering, and unflinching story of this defense. To read it is to have yourself taken apart, undone, touched at the place of your own essence; it is to be turned back, as if after a long absence, into a human being.

i have the 2nd edition on hebrew version and now this as well!

i recommend this game not just for the tight fans but especially for those who dont mingle in the medieval D&D theme

for it is a very positive and light exposure to this fantasy world :)

the game itself is very easy to play
a race game at core mostly won by luck
with twists made by decisions such as movement and engaging other players or face-up cards

A very dated game that still holds a flame of nostalgia in some gamer's hearts.  Even fans of the game will admit that most time it will turn into a complete slog, and it has a punishing randomness that demands one not take the game seriously when playing.  Some find enjoyment in it, but definitely not for me, especially at this play length.  Most other games will give a much higher reward for the time invested.

An OK game. I overrated it because of my deep non-rational sympathy. It was one of the first games I had (old Polish edition) and played with my brother. And the game still has something magical for me.

As to the game itself I guess newer adventure games are better. But I haven't played non so it is hard to compare.

I know it looks alot better and has the new fate tokens to help with bad rolls, but still, this is Talisman. And even though I like it for a few yucks and can be talked into it maybe once a year, the game has the same problems: it's just a ride. You don't really decide much and it can take you to very bad places (if you're unlucky) and wildly, run-a-way-leader places otherwise. Both sides of this are not enjoyable. The expansions help not a bit - but also exacerbate the play time. In it's day, it was fun for me - but no longer.

Even though I have all editions of Talisman, this is the one we play with on a regular basis. FFG gets a big thumbs up and in my humble opinion did a fantastic job! Of course, they had a 30 year history of the game to pool from but really this just demonstrates how thorough they actually were. I see very very few problems with the mechanics of this edition. Well planned and executed.

[2-6] While many people despise this game, I'm pretty fond of the era of gaming it represents. Simple rules, ridiculous outcomes, and kitschy fantasy adventures. It feels so 1980s in the way that it represents a nostalgic throwback to the epic late nights of pizza, soda, and yelling friends. Sure, there's not much strategy but the beauty of gaming is that good game experiences don't have to be strategic. Talisman is trashy fun. Period.

Found the random movement system (by dice) extremely frustrating.  In addition, the characters are unbalanced.  A player with a stronger character can continually force players with weaker characters to start a new character because once you start over, there is no hope of catching the more experienced characters.  On a positive note, the combat system was simple, somewhat involved, but did not create much downtime.  The components are of excellent quality.

I enjoyed playing this back in the 90s. However I really enjoy the new Revised 4th edition today as well. I usually house rule a few things to speed up the play (+stats every 6 points, +1 stat every 4 turns, use fate for moving extra spaces, etc.). It's a much an adventure as a game. I have some amazing memories of games: 1) Playing on my birthday a few years ago and my daughter got to the crown, held off her brother, then I got there and was weak but used a healing trinket to re-heal over and over and over and finally it came down to one roll and she won, epic! 2) Playing on my son's 16th birthday where he held off my friend an I to barely win in the end, epic as well!. If you need a game where you can strategize to win then avoid this. This is random and luck filled and yet great. There's nothing like it. Don't play to 'win', instead play to laugh, tell stories, and have fun!

With the new edition I thought maybe the outdated gameplay would be updated but this is still the same endless roll and move game.

I love this game. Yes, it is heavily driven by luck (dice roll and card draw), but it always gives you a great fantasy story, with new and unexpected situations and turns of events. It also often feels too long, but to me all the negative sides are outshined by the great fun it always provides

Releasing the 4th edition really says all about this game. It's one of the easiest games to get into. Even though it's very detailed. And most of the questions encountered is answered in the short, but informative guide.

I can't give it anything less than 10. Easy to get into. Unique way of building a world.  And you can't be eliminated before the endgame. Even though it's hard starting all over when it's close to the endgame. The mechanics are easy. No fiddling about with a lot of different stats. It's just strenght and craft. And items either raising them or gives you a dice throw to save a life. Couldn't be any simpler.

I love the FFG revised 4th edition of Talisman - good quality stuff. I like the game, all that cards and figurines, but i find somehow that it should get a remake who make it faster and with more mechanics than go left or right a fix number of steps. Is a good experience when played with the right group of people. My score is a bit low because most games took 4-5 hours and we often end stopping time and countering the achievements. 
--------------
I've rise my score to a 8 after 10 games. The best style is to set time at 1-2 h of play and do your best to be the most wealthy guy. The classic end is good to be on the table but is attain by pure luck in this amount of time. The game is in this way more RPG and a lot of fun. Presence of the Reaper on the table is a must in my group and his movements are an sacred obligation :P Very good game!

For me, this game is fueled solely by nostalgia. Add alcohol and the combination makes it fun to play - just shoot the breeze and roll the dice. B-) Also, the FFG Fate chits are a great addition that should've been in the game from the get-go.

Talisman will never win awards for game design, being high on luck, low on strategy.  There IS room for tactics and lots of decisions, but ultimately the chaos and variety are what make this game.  With the right group of people, Talisman is great fun and makes a virtue of being unbalanced, with wild swings of fortune.  Talisman allows more variety of playing styles than many games - yes, you can go for the win, but you can also have a great time just accumulating goodies, becoming super-powerful or frustrating your opponents.

A random and silly mess of a game dressed up in some excellent components.  Talisman certainly should not be the game of choice for those looking for strategy and tactics, but plays great as a fun adventure romp.  The board is gorgeously illustrated (a bit over-sized however), with all of the components working together to help people really get into the theme.  Plays a little long for what it is, but there are plenty of rule variants out there to help shorten playtime.  Overall a great game for those looking to be entertained without the brain burn.

Another roll and move, draw a card, do what it says game.
No ground breaking mechanics.  No best scenario deciphering, engine building, VP grabbing mechanics.

This is another game where immersion, appreciating the imagery and telling a story are the core of the fun. 

WARNING!!!
This game can go on FOREVER.  If the dice decide to crap on the group repeatedly, you can spend literally hours on the verge of victory never to see it.  We have ended more than 1 game at the 3 hour mark due to frustration and boredom.

Very enjoyable, time consuming game. Put on the coffee pot and stoke the pipe. It's gonna be a loooong night.
Now that I own this game, I have created a single player style where I use 2 characters ( the troll and the assassin)as the chasers and 2 characters (either random or the warrior and the dwarf) as the ones that have to try to get to the crown. The chasers have to try to kill the 2 that are trying to get to the crown. Game plays basically the same as a normal game except that the chasers do not need a raft to cross the river and do not need to fight the sentinel.

Granted it is just a roll and move game with simplistic (some might say dull) mechanisms. But we still love playing it for hours. Some times you just want a simple romp through a fantasy world without having to manage your character's mana level or keep track of how damaged your axe has become. It is simplistic but that is what makes it work. We think it is a classic and will continue to enjoy it.

Juego para pasar una tarde divertida sin tener que pensar demasiado.

Hay que recalcar que los personajes no están equilibrados entre ellos. Algunos son muy poderosos mientras que otros son mediocres o directamente "cutres". Para mí eso le da cierto encanto pero puedo comprender que haya gente a la que no le haga nada de gracia.

RATING: 8.5
Great classic game. Good job to FF for remaking a classic and making it shine. Solid game play, fast turns, great artwork. A bit too random for a solid strategy game yet strategy still wins! With all of the expansions the game is a 9 easy. A lot more strategy and you will never ever play the same game twice..... after at least 25 plus games never the same game twice!

Good game. For an old guy, I found the board not as easy to read as the second edition. That being said, the art is excellent, the quality of the components far exceeds the second edition. The rules streamline the play. As you can increase the maximum number of lives, it is easier to get to the crown of command relatively intact. The only downside compared to the second edition was the lack of expansions - I am used to the greater variability of characters, draws from the adventure deck and the expansions themselves, etc. The first time we played the game we went throught e adventure deck twice. We've never done that with the second edition game, even with nine players. 

The simple base game is simply simpler. When we want to play a more complex game with more variability, we play the second edition, when we want an easier game with better esthetics, we play the fourth edition. We are awaiting the possible expansions for this latest version.

RATING: 2
The theme classic fantasy with very good art and the rules are simple enough to teach someone to play in 10 minutes or less.  I think it's the simplicity that made this game unappealing to me because there's too much luck involved performing a random event that happens when landing on most spaces.  I played this a couple times and just couldn't get into it.

I'm sure this would have been great when it was first around. But seriously nowadays there are far better games which achieve the same thing. This was 45 minutes of fun in 3 hours! Some fun moments but just soooooooo long, repetitive, and totally random. Chaos I can usually deal with when provided by the players and where you know the odds but this was just a luck fest.

RATING: 6
I do not know what it is about this game but I find it to be boring.  Maybe that is because every time it has been played there was drinking involved and the more consumption the longer it is until your next turn.  In fact, I do not think we have ever completed a game of this because we end up getting bored of just doing the same thing over and over again.

When we started playing this game, the rating was a 7.  We were having fun, laughing, enjoying the varied cards.  As the game progressed, the rating kept dropping.  It was repetitive.  There were almost no decisions to be made, other than which direction to move on the board.  It was tedious.  It was LOOOOONNNNNNGGGG.  The box says 90 minutes, but when the second one of us had been teleported from the inner ring to the outer 3.5 hours into the game, we all quit.  I [b][i]hate[/b][/i] this game.  The reason it's not a 1 is for that first enjoyable thirty minutes.

I hate this game. I understand why people like it but it has nothing that I like about games. If the characters progressed/Leveled up in a meaningful and faster way it could be something, but what ends up happening instead is a 4 hour plus stroke job of running around the outer ring gaining the smallest of upgrades and occasionally luck sacking on some ridiculous weapon that actually gets you somewhere. Too damn long and too damn boring.

I love playing this game when I don't want to think too much but still want to enter fantasy world.  It's easy to have a few beers and relax with this game.  It's definitely heavily dependent on luck.  Some of the characters are ridiculously overpowered.   It's a game I don't have to take too seriously and can still enjoy even when my character is failing pitifully.  

I have the Dragon Expansion and enjoy it more with that addition.  More monsters to fight and more encounter options.

This is one of those games that I'm glad I tried, and it was enjoyable, but I don't really see myself playing more than once more. Although it was fun, I just don't see this game having much re-playability as there really isn't a whole lot of room for trying different tactics.

I love Talisman due t the massive nostalgia value (played it to death in the 80s). The replay value is limited for gamers though - when you realise just how random the game is. One of our group stated that we might was well roll d6 at the start of the game to see who won, and save 2 hours of our lives! In the right environment it's fun nonetheless.

Talisman is the beautiful girl (or guy) you've been pining for that finally agrees to that date. The relationship starts well! I mean, c'mon, look at those sexy game pieces! That beautiful board! Can it get any better than this? Well....yes. It can. After spending a little time with your "dream gal or guy," you slowly begin to realize something. They're shallow twits! The more I play Talisman, the less I like it. Admittedly, I had high expectations because I love fantasy themed games and the game is a visual beauty. Alas, it offers nothing in terms of strategy and is completely a luck driven dice-fest.

To me it feels like this game plays you rather than you playing it, as if it's some malevolent god deciding on a whim who gets to have all the cool stuff and lots of fun and who gets to bounce aimlessly around getting squashed by dragons.

After many many years, Talisman hit the table again: my eldest daughter is about to turn 7, so she can stand a longer game, and she can read enough to enjoy a few hours of adventuring.

I decided to embrace the chaos, and go for the full [user=HiveGod][/user] package: heavy storytelling and fast pace!
Result? She loved it and wanted to play again as soon as we finished our first 2-and-a-half hours first game! (with a special appearance of the youngest 4-and-half years old, for almost an hour...)

It's roll and move, pure luck, outdated as hell... But if the daughters love it, I'll love it too (like I did when I was 13...)!

ok, so I haven't actually played this edition. but so have many other that gave it a higher rating from what they say. I can't believe they haven't taken the chance to change some rules to make this game playable . warrior knights, dracula, and others were changed to make them fit in 21 century, this is kept in all of its badly-aged monstrosity. plus, the artwork in my opinion is a lot worse (at least compared to the polish edition, which seems to have better artwork than all the english talisman editions from the pictures available here). not to mention the unreadable 'high quality' plastic life/strength/etc counters. I'll stick to my old edition, thank you.

Really good adventure board game when playing with 4 or more players.

Then it will be very entertaining and fast-paced. It also creates a nice atmosphere at the table.

A true "feel-good" boardgame with the right group! Nonetheless the game mechanics are kind of old (roll and move) and it can drag very long.

EDIT 2016: Talisman is a special game. When I start playing thematic games I liked the game quite a bit. After bying more and more expansions and mixed that in the fun was going away because - yes - it is very (too) random and it can drag on forever when playing with the expansions. 

Last week I played it again with only the base board and I rediscovered what I liked about it. Not the mechanics (are there any mechanics in Talsiman?) make it a nice game - it is the flow of play and the thematic atmosphere. You can like Talisman if you take it not that seriously. Next time I want to play with only one big board expansion mixed in.

Hmmmm - preliminary rating after one play.  We had 6 players, and it seemed to draaaaaaaag on.  It would seem that maybe 3 or 4 would be the ideal number?  I'd try it again with fewer people.  The gameplay reminds me a bit of Arkham Horror as well as Mystic Wood.

Love this game....gets a lot of hate because of dice movement and because of randomness.....now I am not usually one for too much randomness but in this it just works once all the expansions are added it just feels epic.....ok yes it is kind of broken with some of the expansion card, and yes it can be very very random you may die on the roll of one dice after building up you're character but it was just so fun in this. The amount of characters you can play the amount of things that can happen in a card. The game can be very long, I make myself stupidly strong before facing the end just because I enjoy it, the inner circle feels a little broken as new powers etc. was introduced and some of the board bosses etc. Still it is great fun

I wanted to like this game because I love the throwback fantasy aesthetic of the 4th edition, but it really is archaic in a lot of ways, and houseruling can only help so much.

I never played Talisman as a kid, but if I had, my brothers and I would no doubt have spent entire days sprawled around this game on the floor of the lounge. Yes, it's silly, it's unfair, it scales poorly, it's hugely reliant on the luck of the dice. But there's something in it that just sparks the imagination, as each card drawn adds a tiny detail to your hero's story, a glorious song of vanquished foes and endless treasure, or a tale of woe in which bandits steal your gold, a poltegeist haunts you incessantly, and a witch turns you into a toad. In another life I could see myself buying EVERY EXPANSION and luxuriating in the glorious vastness of it all, but I know that sort of money (and shelf space) could get me a dozen other (better) games.

used to play the 1st Ed ,I used to own the main game , but a friend had all of the expansions,  Hours of fun had by all

Although Centaur in 1st Ed got a bit irritating, and we found (like in some games) to keep the gameplay fun we kept various characters out of rotation sometimes.  

we also re-wrote the rules a bit (but then who doesn't)

Looking forwards to getting my hands on this

Let me start by saying, "I love this game"! I have been a huge fan of the franchise since the 2nd edition.  I never played the 3rd ed. and kept playing with the older 2nd.  This 4th ed. blew me away the second I opened the box.  The board is huge and the graphics on both the board and the cards are a massive improvement to the earlier versions.  I love the cones and very happy to see the contents appear to be more sturdy than the 2nd ed.  What I like about the game is how easily it plays.  It is a simple RPG, character builder game with dice rolls and modifiers. I can enjoy it with my 8 yo and with new players too.  I noticed after a few plays that some of the nuances of the 2nd ed. were corrected in subtle tweaks in the rules/mechanics.  Just as I did with the 2nd ed, I plan to obtain as many of the expansions as I can get my hands on.

I bought this because I was curious and because I got a GREAT deal on it, but if you have second edition, you should probably pass.

Now have both the Black Industries version, and FFG.  

FFG version fixes the abusive characters and such, but to be honest, I'm not sure how I feel about that.  I liked exploiting them.

Talisman is just a fantasy version of the Game of Goose: you roll some dice, move onto a square, get something or lose something and live with it until your next turn. This is Talisman made short, which can be fun in the beginning but, in the end, suffers the very same as any dungeon crawl: it’s a long, endlessly tiring game. [i](October 2011)[/i]

[b]Update[/b] - The very same comment above has been more than enough a reason during my Fall 2015 rating revise to lower my rating from an excessive 8 to a more fitting 4, that better mirrors what now I’m growing toward all dungeon crawls.

Likes:
- As with cosmic encounter, no game ever feels the same.  Every character has powers that make their play style feel very different.
- Simple to teach to new players.  Can get going quickly.
- Lots of crazy combo's that just bring about lots of laughs.

Dislikes:
- Playing time sometimes can get a bit out of hand for what the game is
- Doesn't seem to be as much fun at the upper end of players.

THE fantasty adventure game.  Dozens of games have tried to fell Talisman...but none have ever succeeded.  It remains in print and thriving despite all the haters that claim it's merely a roll n move...fantasy Monopoly for nerds.  Screw those people.  Talisman is great.  In order to feel like an adventure it needs to be wildly unpredictable and brash.  Talisman is one of those games that will probably always be around.  It will outlive us all...and someday your children's children will crack it open and go on their own epic quests.

Last time I played Talisman was probably over 25 years ago, I think Second Edition.  I was ho hum about it then, and pretty much ho hum now with 4th edition.  A nice roll and move fantasy romp, with loads of dice rolling, card drawing and just general luck.  Fun, if played in the right spirit and you have a few hours to spare but its not going to change the world.  Would still consider this as an introductory/transition game for those not familar with "modern" gaming, or the fantasy "theme".   Probably won't hit the table that often. And indeed since writing the above 4 years ago - it hasn't (2016)

RATING: 6
Kinda good game. I have all the expansions but they are starting to dilute the experience as they are all so disparate. Need a new expansion that unifies the game eg. Quests that start in one expanded region and ends in another expanded region.

Edit: Deep Realms expansion looks like a step in the right direction. Will have to check it out when able.

This is a game that is awful without expansions. Then again, the rules are fairly awful regardless and generally needs a few house rules. The fun comes in trying to create a story around your character and spoiling the other players' plans. Or whenever someone is turned into a toad.

FFG have made a few improvements, primarily fate tokens. You still have random battles though and it still becomes exponentially easier as you level up.

Talisman is a Chinese water torture. It is the death of a thousand cuts. It is the stone of Sisyphus, a calliope of boredom. It's the first 5 seconds of each day from Groundhog Day. It's the steaming charred mass in the toaster oven at the end of Time Bandits. Talisman is the science teacher from The Wonder Years without any filmstrips. It's neither a floor wax nor a dessert topping. It's a mirage in the desert, a black widow crawling up your chest. It's a female preying mantis and you're it's mate. It's a stale box of Crackerjacks without a toy surprise. Talisman is the Night of the Living Dead, the Dark Side of the Force. It's the Energizer bunny gone hideously awry. It's that dream where you're running as fast as you can but you're not going anywhere and when you open your mouth to scream, nothing comes out. Talisman is a naked singularity, an event horizon from which fun cannot escape. It's a souffle that never rose, the fault-ridden pudding skin in the back of the fridge. Talisman is Xeno's worst nightmare.

Talisman is a simple game. This edition is suitable for play with non-gamers or occaisional gamers, and if you have nostalgic memories of the orginal but do not want to ruin your collectable 2nd ed copy. The art is true to the orignal and no rules have been tinkered with over those house rules that have been in house-play for years anyway.

Monopoly style game earning craft and strength enough to enter the center chamber to obtain the Crown of Command. Of course you will need a Talisman to cross the plane of fire in order to enter the final chambers. Excellent adventuring game with loads of items, weapons, armor etc... oh yeah don't forget about those followers. A fun fast paced game of adventure for the entire family who enjoys a fantasy style board games with a little bit of character development thrown in the mix.

Rich fantasy universe, but also simple to understand.
It might get some time to finish a game (2-3 hours), but there are ways to make it faster; like giving some extra attributes at the start of the game or leveling up faster.
The miniatures are nice and detailed. Also love the theme from the board and the cards.

This wasn't a terrible game... but I didn't feel it was great either. All around it was long. Very long. Like 4 hours in and we'd just gotten to the dungeon and had to call it long. We packed up the pieces in seperate baggies by player, intending to finish the game another time- never came back to it. I don't mind long games, but this felt like there wasn't much going on. Maybe better with expansions? Though that'd add to the length... I dunno, would try again, but we sold our copy as no one ever wanted to play it because of the length!

What can I say.. I love this game. I know it is 90% based on luck and dice rolling is the main mechanics. I don't care. It brings back my memories from childhood when I used to play it with friends. 

- Talisman is a great series (maybe except Dragons expansion that changes the game completly unnecessarily..)
- remember - the game is based 90% on luck. It won't give You a chance to plan anything precisely ;) 

- playing time.. (to be honest: can take 180 minutes and more but if You add expansions.. 1-2 days :P)

This was my first "big" board game and I used to love it. But the truth is that this game has nothing to offer. Nowadays there are just so many better fantasy 'RPG' gateway board games. If you want to convert someone intro a boardgamer, try something else, like Runebound. Talisman feels archaic and it needs to be forgotten.

What a dumb game! It's pointless and arbitrary and you mostly stumble around loosely trying to form and follow a strategy, regardless I LOVE this game! There is just something about it...it reminds me of Dark Tower from back in the day. Despite the fact that the game is taking YOU on a ride, it's a ride I WANT to go on. Might get a little dusty as it takes so frigging long to play and I may only get it out once or twice a year. It shall remain.

Bought used off Craigslist with 2 expansions. Excellent condition.
I thought the game was ok.  The family thought slightly less of it.  It was a long game that got repetitious.  It would probably improve with more plays to get the hang of the strategy but that would mean investing lots and lots of time in more plays. 
Edit:  have played it a few more times and am liking it more each time.  Bought a well cared for copy off craigslist with 2 small expansions.  We have incorporated a couple of house rules (starting with one more strength and craft than the rules state) that really help cut down the length of the game which really helps us enjoy it more.

This is a beer-and-pretzels roll-and-move fantasy romp and it's perfect for what it is.  You're basically rolling dice and moving and seeing what happens.  But there are some decisions and there is skill involved in how you approach pumping your character and choosing when and how you go into the inner areas.  Most of this comes from some experience and knowing the board, which you will have after a couple plays.  It's also great how much material there is for this game through all the expansions.

Algunos lo denominan la oca friki. Y la descripción es bastante acertada. El tablero consiste en tres pistas concentricas y en cada casilla pueden surgir retos y cartas que cambian las propiedades de la casilla y tal. Cada jugador lleva un personaje con ciertas características (fate, gold, strength, craft) y a medida que avanza el juego puede ir recogiendo objetos o ganando experiencia y aumentando sus características. El objetivo es llegar a la casilla central, desde donde se pueden lanzar rayos para eliminar a los contrincantes. 
Es un juego sencillo de mecánicas, pero con numerosisismas cartas que hacen que cada partida sea un mundo. Es completamente caótico. En cualquier momento un mal evento o una mala tirada, puede echar a perder toda una trayectoria de mejora del personaje... así con todo, puede resultar divertido.

La pega que le veo es que es bastante largo de jugar. Para esa duración (sólo he jugado una partida a seis, inconclusa, que duró cuatro horas), hay mejores opciones. Es un juego sin pretensiones.. para pasar el rato, putear al prójimo y probar qué tal suerte tienes con los dados.

Es muy conocido.. y hay muchísimas expansiones. Van por la cuarta edición.

Just fantastic. This is a real universe full of heroes, strangers, monsters, magic and adventures. With the expansions, there is an unlimited replayability. It doesn´t matter if the game mechanics are dull....it´s the story that matters. And there are not many games that tell better stories. 
The 4th edition is a worthy successor to the legendary Games Workshop 2nd edition, wich is nothing less than board game history. It adds even more expansions and if that´s not enough, there´s a ton of fan made stuff out there. 
Not the biggest fan of the new Fate concept. Components are great...beautiful minis and great art.

Though I won my first game of this, it was in no way due to any skill.  For the first two hours, my character lumbered around the first ring of the board doing very little--failing attacks, failing to increase craft or stength, while other characters did quite well.  I did get a gnome.  Then I found a raft, went to the interior, and marched to the end.  There, I rolled a die for about a hour trying to kill off everyone else.

While I didn't dislike this game, I didn't like it either.  More an experience than a game. I had fun, but rolling a die, flipping a card to see what happens, is only mildly interesting. I would play again, but would not suggest it.

Is it the deepest game? No, but I don't really care.  It's a huge amount of fun to play with my kids.  A role and move game where the decision of when to go for the Crown of Command seems to be the central question.  I wish the spells played a bit more of a central role for some of the characters or maybe had a mechanism by which you had to be a certain level to use them.  I'm not sure, but they felt tangential to the game most of the times I've played.  I like the different roles in that you really have to play them differently.  I'm anxious to try the dungeon expansion.

Why on earth is this game not only still in print, but still being given new expansions!?!? I actually find the track board, the theme, and the basic premise--move around, drawing cards, having adventures, and fighting monsters--to be actually pretty fun. It's that damned roll-and-move that's the problem: "So I've been turned into a toad and can't get any of my items back until I land exactly on this spot? And there's no way to increase my chances? So I have a 16% chance?" [i]Roll. End turn. Roll. End turn. Roll. End turn. Roll. End turn. Roll...[/i] "Oh, I guess you win."

This isn't a game you play. It's a game that happens to you.

Talisman was really my first step into designer board games. I played it and liked it, but once I got a taste of the games that followed (Arkham Horror, Runebound, Descent, RoboRally), Talisman began to lose luster for me. It seemed flat, random and uninteresting. THEN, Fantasy Flight acquired the game, made some excellent revisions and unleashed two expansions that provided rocket fuel to my affection for this game. The Dungeon Expansion, in particular, adds depth and nostalgic flavor to this game.

Without the expansions, I'd probably rate the initial 4E Talisman a 7 and the revised FF 4E an 8. But *with* the expansions (and there's no reason not to play all of them all the time), this game is classic. It has caused me to completely re-evaluate my Top 10.

I am thrilled that enough interest sparked yet another edition of Talisman.  I am not sure how I feel about this issue, having played just once so far.  I like that it feels closer to the second edition that I love and I expect it is going to be a favorite because of the nostalgia.  I am sad that the end is not as interesting as it was with the random suck factor of second edition where one could struggle and claw the way to the top only to be cast out into the black void.  Kudos to the coins in 4th edition.  Half kudos to the colorful shapes representing life, strength and craft - why weren't the colors or shapes done in a better way to distinguish them easier, rather than sorting through them in a maddening fashion that we have currently.  I can only hope that some of the expansions will come out to go with it, most especially the one I missed with second edition, Dragons!  As my husband said, we could always use our expansions from second edition with it.  Also, if anyone influential sees this, think about adding more character cards - far too few.

I really had a blast playing Talisman. As should be obvious, this is not a game that your megagamer winwinwinnner types are likely to enjoy. It's pure, dumb, thematic fun. Still, it isn't totally strategy-free. Deciding in which direction to head and when are really important. So is deciding for how long  you can push your luck and build up your strength on the outer tracks before one of the other players beats you to the crown. Is the games super-deep or offering myriad decisions? No, but what exactly are you expecting from a thematic roll-and-move that nearly anyone (save ubergamer snobs) will enjoy?

As as usual with FFG, the art is not so great and it is overproduced and has those crappy small cards, but for once I didn't mind. Talisman was a great property for FFG to pick up and I'm grateful that they did.

This is the first hobby game I ever bought. I admit I mostly bought it because the box art looked cool but it got me started on playing other board games. This is a game where people love it when they first are introduced to Ameritrash, and then love to hate when they discover heavier games with just as cool themes.

I admit it can be light and tedious, but sometimes I'm in the mood for a light game like this where I can socialize with the players and still have a fun time. For this reason, I am a defender of this game's honor. In any case, I love rolling dice and fighting dragons and goblins so I just can't argue with that.

Just discovered a bunch of cool sounding variants for the game I'm eager to try out. It may improve my rating for it.

A faithful reprint of the 2nd edition with a much bigger board. The FFG edition corrects many of the poor design decisions made in the Black Industries edition.

The FFG expansions offer more options and variety.

A significant improvement from the 3rd Edition.  I never owned the 2nd Ed, but did play a few times back in my college days.  Any comparisons to 2nd Ed won't be accurate due to memory loss.

I enjoy this game much more than the last iteration.  The fact that a player wins when everyone else dies (rather than after beating the Dragon King) is much more pleasing.  It speeds up game play if you play with agressive players, and encourages more player interaction as it is more likely that characters will want to encounter other characters on a space, rather than encountering the space.  I also like the third "inner" ring that is missing on the 3rd edition.  The Raft cards make for a great way to get across the river, and the corner buildings are better.  Gold also flows more freely.  The spells are also better, and make playing a spellcaster much more pleasing.

My only gripe with this edition is the glossy, almost "sticky" nature of the cards.  It forces them to stick together, and when combined with their annoyingly small size, makes shuffling very difficult.

Overall, though a great game - nicely harkens back to what I remember about the 2nd Ed from 20 years ago.

EDIT:  Gave it to my friend as a "House Warming Gift" when he finally moved out of his parents basement and got an apartment.  Which is fine, as I intend to obtain the forthcoming FFG reprint.

EDIT:  Have finally reacquired Talisman - this time, it's the FFG Revised 4th.  I like it better.  Better rulebook, better plastic mini's, better cards.  Better everything.

The game that got me into board gaming. I love Talisman. I know all of the criticisms that can be leveled against it, but I disagree with them on matters of principle and taste. Talisman is just plain fun. My gaming group enjoys Talisman so much that we have given up playing D&D for it. Also: the fourth edition greatly improves upon the design of the 3rd and 2nd editions of the game, adding nuance, strategy, and some much-needed balance to a game that was once ONLY based on luck. Despite what some may say, there is a possibility for strategy in Talisman, but the fates may not be kind to you when you roll the dice. . .

If you can't already tell, I love this game.

I played a variation of this game with different objectives than the base game.  Even that took forever to play, with no sense of any sort of accomplishment.  I ended up dying and took that as my cue to duck out of the game rather than start over.  That was after a couple of hours, and from what I saw, the game still took a couple more hours before it was just called due to time constraints.

RATING: 2
This rating may seem a bit harsh, but I'm trying to be honest. An obvious amount of TLC has gone into this game, but I just can't get over the "roll and hope" aspect of the game. Also, players keep drawing from the same pool of monsters throughout the game, so there's no excalation of excitement. 

I've played this game more times than I'd prefer, and most have ended rather flat. I have one friend that loves this game, and his enthusiasm is what can make the game enjoyable.

Update: I'm sticking with a "3" rating. I keep getting talked into it, and I still always regret it in the morning.

I like the game, I like the expansions and add-on boards.  What I'm not the biggest fan of is the 1d6 movement on your turn.  Sometimes you can have a location you need to get to and just spend turn after turn not getting there.  Sometimes this isn't so bad as there can be other objectives nearby, but just as often there may be nothing or even faults nearby.  I think it is a great game for people who are newer to the game, and love how nearly every game can be very very different due to all the character choices and multitude of expansion options.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
A game with a frustratingly high luck-factor, yet I still love it and have to rank it highly. If you purchase the expansions, you can quickly accumulate more cards than you can store or stack.

Classic but flawed. Very long and tedious grid up to a usually somewhat exciting conclusion. Unbalanced classes and almost completely random based gameplay. The randomness can only be mitigated with longer prepare/grind time before going into the inner zones.

Still have fond memories of this game, I played the first edition as a kid and we played the 4:th quite a bit in college. Probably wont bring it out again though unless for nostalgia.

What can you say?  A classic.  Roll dice.  Move.  Do what card says or what the space says.  Kids love it. We can pick up and play anytime.  We've taken this one on some camping trips and its even better then.  Not exactly a brainbuster but it has a special place with me.

I had the original GW version from way back. Got back into gaming & bought the new 4th edition to replace my damaged old copy.  Not much has changed, the components are a lot nicer now but the rules and gameplay are as I remembered.

It is a fun game, but can take a long time to get a session in. This limits it's tabletop time. I need to look into the expansions to see if any accelerate things (unlikely).

RATING: 6.5
Snakes and ladders with a fantasy theme. Very random and grind heavy.  

I like the way the world and encounters are built around the board by random player interaction. A spell granting wizard might pop up here, a merchant might pop up there, but the random nature of the movement mechanic can just as well keep you from ever encountering the world that is being built for the players.

Nice components, especially the coins. Almost feels like real metal. Sounds like it too. The minis are very nicely sculpted and match the character cards well. 

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Snakes and Ladders with a fantasy theme. Pays to play the odds and be a bit reckless - except when it doesn't! Goes on a little too long for what it is. Mechanics are nice and simple, but a bit limited for how long the game takes. Seems you're doing a lot of the same for X hours. Building up your character takes too long for it's own good. If it was the same experience but half as long, I'd rate it higher. Time to try a variant. 

I like how the board populates itself with places and encounters. 

Ramble, ramble, ramble... I think I need to pick up an expansion for me to really like this one. Something that helps the game get to the point faster, or adds more variety in the mechanics. 

I tend to like to play this more after it's been a long week and I want to play a game, but not really make any decisions.

3rd play added The Reaper expansion.

5th play added The Frostmarch expansion.

Play with my 6 and 8 year olds - they like it a lot.  Lot's of reading, though, so I need to help them a bit.

Game tends to drag a bit, and I really don't like the end game (crown of command) mechanic at all.

Not a bad way to kill a couple of hours - very much a "going for a ride" game, it's nearly 100% luck.

I played 3rd Edition the day I switched jobs and never looked back.  This 4th version is even better because it has minis for even the TOADS.

Talisman is the chaotic love child of D&D and Candyland.  Has many of the worst design sensibilities of the '80s, yet it still manages to be a fun experience.

1 or 2 plays. Fun game that sometimes feels like it's telling a story out of a fantasy novel. Lots of twists and turns. Very well designed and illustrated, decidedly non-eurogame mechanics. Learning game with 4p was about 3+ hrs. The ending was a Tijuana Death Match.  (Later: I'm feeling the urge to play these colorful, lively experience games more and more. I think I want my own copy of Talisman.) http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/438714/the-strategic-decisions-of-talisman

As I'm probably the Talisman expert of our growing group, having grown up with it, I like to describe it as the only game we have access to where the gameplay is "roll the dice, land on a square, draw a card, and do what it says." Isn't that what all games were like back in the day? It seems so rare to still see now. The Talisman franchise does this all with flair, and multiple decks each the side of your head. My sense of time must be affected by nostalgia, because the newbies always tell me the game runs too long. I'll take their word for it. If you don't mind an even longer game, play with *all* the expansions: each attaches to one corner of the board. If you want a more grown up version, you'll find a near exact but enhanced version called Relic.

I HATE roll and move games. But with Talisman, you seem to always be doing SOMETHING which is a huge bonus and negates the monotony of roll and move. Plus there is ALWAYS a chance a player will affect you on their turn. Bumped up to an 8 because looking back a lot of non-gamers and people who prefer lighter and even shorter games liked this one. Only an 8 and not higher due to the fact expansions are where it can really shine. Note: Ignore the Command Spell garbage, that only prolongs the game. Whoever gets to the crown first wins.

RATING: 10
We simply can't stop playing this game! Epic struggle for the Crown of Command. Many early memories about RPGs and classic fantasy books (for example Titan by Livingstone and Jackson) have come up since Talisman is the part of my collection of boardgames. 

Update on 8 August, 2012.
Having purchased a few of the expansions like the Highland, the Dungeon, the Frostmarch and the Sacred Pool this game is even more entertaining than before.
The pile of Adventure cards is so tall that we play with our own house rule for this: after shuffling this deck very much, we usually create 2-4 decks from it (depending on the number of players). Ideally every player has its own deck of adventure cards. Besides this ways it gets easier to handle so many Adventure cards, this also symbolizes fate or determination in the game. 
Of course, decreasing the number of adventure cards before playing could be a solution, but we don't want to select certain cards while leave out others.

Update on 24 November, 2013.
Having purchased all of the expansions, my collection is complete, at least until the next expansion.
I sorted out all the adventure cards of the base game because of their generic nature. This way we only use the adventure cards from the expansions. The adventure deck is still huge and hard to handle properly, but it does worth the effort! :D


Update on July 31st, 2015
My 4th revised edition Talisman collection seems to be complete. I just keep repeating myself, but this is an amazing game if you play it with expansions. The Blood Moon, the Dragon, the Woodland etc. all expansions are well integrated into the base game and make it something different and something variable. We almost always play the game with the hidden ending variant which keeps the excitement high. 
Although the base game can be easily regarded as a roll and move type of a simple game, with expansions it really begins to shine as a complex game where you have more options than just deciding which way to go on the board.

RATING: 10
OK, I'll tell you up front that the supposed "discerning" gamers who bitch and moan about the luck/randomness/chaos in TALISMAN or the assumption that the game lacks "meaningful choices" (whatever that means in the context of a f&%king board game)just don't get it.  They never will, and for those Days of Wonder shills, middle managers, and spreadsheet fanatics there's plenty of games out there to satisfy their desire to amoritize, impress, and bid their way to victory.  Make no mistake- the 4th edition of TALISMAN will not make you a believer if you didn't like it to begin with, nor should it because it is first and foremost a return of the classic 2nd edition of the game which has not, contrary to some opinions here, become "dated" or "aged poorly". Nor is the appeal of the game somehow limited to some hazy sense of nostalgia.  In fact, having not played the base game without expansions, I was really amazed at how good a game TALISMAN really is- even with THE CITY, DUNGEON, TIMESCAPE, et. al. stripped away.  It's simple, almost elemental, and definitely classical.  But dated?  That's like saying that Johnny Cash records are dated.  No- it doesn't feature the currently in-vogue mechanics and it's not one of these oh-so-clever minimalist Eurogames where the designer's goal was to abstract everything interesting away to a simple flowchart.  But that doesn't make it any less vital, exciting, and fun, then it was when I played it for the first time nearly 20 years ago.  What's more significant is that returning to TALISMAN made me realize that a lot of what's missing in games today is a real sense of character, a palpable heart and soul that makes the game truly unique.  Even amongst games like TALISMAN inspired games like PROPHECY or FFG's fantasy titles, TALISMAN stands out as something singular in the hobby that has proven over the past 25 years to be a timeless, perennial game that will likely be played and enjoyed long after the faddish games that litter the hobby now are long forgotten.  Fortunately, this is also the best produced edition of TALISMAN to date although I do  miss the old GW-style artwork but it's a beautiful set that manages to capture baroque 1980s-style fantasy with modern production values in a very classy package.  Black Industries has really got their work cut out for them now- I'm already ready for the expansions!

This one is a classic for me. I have been playing Talisman in its various forms since I was in primary school. It is also how I was reintroduced to board gaming due to my sister buying me a copy of the 4th edition for Christmas in 2011 (for nostalgic reasons). Can see myself playing ocassionally, but have to admit I would prefer to play the many other better games out there.

Provisional rating. Only played 1 game. The rule book stinks. Many issues unclear. Having never played it until 2009, it really is painfully dated. And while it also takes a little luster off Prophesy, realizing how much that game ripped off Talisman, I still would greatly prefer to play that, which just works much better. Maybe I'm a sucker, but I want to try the expansions before passing final judgment. Also, I hated my first play of Prophesy, and then later played many many times, after realizing that it's not Knizia, and isn't trying to be, and I can actually still have fun.

It's a good game. For me it's like an upgraded Ludo / Pachisi / Chinczyk (it has many names) - anybody could play it, regardless of age and number of opponents, and have a good fun. A classical, luck-driven random game with awesome theme. However, a choice of cards is insufficient, especially if you play with 4+ players. The card deck is not really balanced. Games quickly become repeatable since you can remember most important cards and get ready for them, being sure that they will appear soon. You will need at least one expansion to make that game what it should be.

I've owned this game for roughly seven years. I've played it about five to six times in all that time. Every now and then someone is like "hey, we haven't played Talisman in ages and I'd like to play it even though I have a faint memory it is not very good" to which everyone else replies "sure, why not, let's give it a chance, I have a few cans of beer ready and my dice hand itches".

This is followed by roughly two to three hours of frantic dice throwing after which everyone comes to the conclusion that this game can't be won in any reasonable time and it's extremely boring. After this we bury the game box in the deep of the night into the flower bed in my back yard until it's time for it to do it's yearly manifestation again.

Seriously. In this game you just throw the die and hope you can do something good with the result. Wait for everyone else to do the same and then it's your turn again. No serious planning or anything like that. Too random. It would be ok if the playtime was under an hour, but in our hands the game always ends up lasting an eternity. Maybe we are just too good or conservative in keeping our characters alive?

For the fantasy/dungeon-crawling/level up your dude game with some "take that!" moments, this race to the center of the board game is my favorite.  Good beer game.  I am not going to argue with those who decry its dated roll-and-move mechanics or the fact that every single thing in this game is random.  That's what Talisman is- and it's awesome. It runs a  little long and I wouldn't play with more than 3 players due to downtime/game length.

My daughter (6) and my wife love this game! What a great adventure every time. She is also very much into the whole background and insists on playing the troll (he's the strongest character). She also wins quite often which may have something to do with my wife and me fighting each other quite often and letting her alone.

I used to play the Schmidt Spiele (=2nd) edition quite a lot in the beginning 90s. 

I have painted all the miniatures, and I have replaced the life 'cones' with glass marbles which look great.

Thank you, Santa!! This was the greatest gift ever!

Epic game when played with a number of the many expansions that are available. Best played with 3 or 4 as more can lead to a lot of downtime between turns. So many options and places to explore that it is almost impossible to experience it all in one play. Expansions add lots of new gameplay rules and additional material, best of all they can be interchanged or just partially used. One of the best games for modding, literally hundreds of 3rd party expansions are available.

This game is definitely a blast with the right mix of people.  As long as everyone realizes that it is a race, all the while climbing over the backs of your fellow players, and not a strategic adventure game, eveyone should have a ball kicking each other while they're down.  Our game session was filled with groans, laughs, odd voice acting and sound effects as misfortune befell each other.  Friends and family were quick to jump upon their once-mighty rivals, as they were were weakened by encounters, with no thought as to right or wrong.  I can't wait to get this game to the table with people that can relax and are prepared to not only enjoy the misfortune of others, but willing to exploit small windows of opportunity in order to cause said misfortune.

Way more fun than something that relies so heavily on random dice rolls has any right to be. This game's main virtues are the sheer variety of PCs and encounters, along with a good luck manipulation mechanic in case the dice decide they hate you. I find playing with one or two large expansions strikes the optimal balance between exploration and reasonable playing time.

This is an epic adventure game. But I think that it's a little bit too long - we played about 2 hours and it was just a half, I think. But I can't say that we were bored - no, it was pretty fun walking around the map and fighting all these monsters and each other.
Maybe in future we will decrease this time... maybe.

I know this isn't a game for hardcore players but I have a lot of affection for this old skool classic.  It was my first "proper" board game and I played it a LOT as a child, so I have a soft spot for Talisman!

However, since playing more games (like Mage Knight for example), I've begun to realise how much I don't like games that rely too heavily on dice rolling, which unfortunately Talisman does.  Sadly as a consequence of this, Talisman doesn't get played much anymore.  It will still stay in my collection though for that old skool love that I have for this game.

I like talisman but It can take all day to play.. It's really tough if you have to try and go through the center section to get to the throne. is so mch easier to obliterate the boss in the dungeon and reach the throne that way.. can be difficult to do with some of the characters.

I thought I would enjoy this re-make more than I actually did.  The components are beautiful and artwork excellent.  Not as entertaining as 3rd edition, but that might be a nostalgia issue for me.  I have a majority of 2nd edition stuff, but its never hit the table.  Unfortunately, that makes me unable to compare it to 2nd edition.  Anyway, I'm going to give it a few more chances.  I'm certainly pleased that I didn't dump my 3rd ed collection when I found out Talisman was going to be reprinted.

This game is nuts.  I mean, I know what it is and how it goes - and I enjoy it if in the mood.  Is fantasy themed random lunatic stuff and not to be taken that seriously.  But every now and then people say "let's play Talisman and get drunk and laugh at each other" and it's perfect.  I am sure we could play plenty of stuff drunk, but you know, it's got toads, it's nuts, it does the trick.  An acquired taste - like Marmite.  Or Dune the movie.

If you take Talisman for what it is (a light, luck infested game of fantasy), it is very enjoyable. I never played prior editions, and have played many games of Runebound, Descent, Return of the Heroes in this genre. That said, this is good 'lighter' version of those games. 

FFG has improved on the new edition in both quality of components and the variety in gameplay with the expansions.

It takes an eternity to play, you're a slave to random die rolls and card draws at literally every turn, and the endgame is pretty uninteresting... but this game nevertheless manages to produce enough interesting moments and fun narrative turns that I can't quite bring myself to hate it. This is true pulp board gaming, for better or worse.

Talisman 4th ed is a luck driven adventure game with gorgeus components but no real strategic or tactical depth. There's a luck pushing element, but most of the time your decisions won't matter that much. Still... Talisman creates stories (mostly tragedies) and if you like roleplaying and getting into stories, Talisman is definitely the game for you. I know I like it.

Talisman was a pleasant surprise.  After watching the video reviews I didn't think there was enough to hold my interest, but I had fun when I played it.  It's more like discovering what happens to you than it is controlling your own destiny.  You have limited control over what happens, but luck rules the day.  As long as you know this going in it can be a good time.  I would play it again with people new to gaming, or as a party game...but that's pretty much about it's only draw for me.  I would recommend one play to decide for yourself.

RATING: 8
I know everyone hates roll and move, and everyone hates too much randomness in their games, and for that reason a lot of people hate Talisman, I can't help it I just find I really enjoy this game.

The theme really draws me in, there aren't many games of this ilk (or not many stand-out games). There are plenty of dungeon crawlers but how many games outside of RPGs let you wander strange lands meeting strange characters and having high adventure along the way?

In its fourth edition now the quality really shows. The artwork is superb. The miniatures are works of art in themselves (sure you can find better miniatures elsewhere, but very few boardgames have miniatures of this quality and level of detail).

Roll and move can get frustrating but Talisman at least lets you choose between two destinations, and in the end game it lets you have more control over your movement. You can always house rule two dice for movement and pick one if you want more control, personally it bugs me less in this game than it does elsewhere, I'm not sure why, probably because it forces me into choices I wouldn't have made and that often leads to epic battles or unexpected treasure troves.

Equal parts rewarding and punishing (nobody wants to be turned into a toad three turns before they capture the crown of command), one thing I really enjoy is that it's difficult to come up with an overarching strategy that lets one player dominate. Picking random characters and the randomness inherent in some much of the game, from the movement to the adventure cards to the expanded end conditions in the expansions, means you're always thinking on your feet and it's one game where newbies are not severely disadvantaged when going up against seasoned players.

Game length can run ridiculously long, especially if players are afraid to commit to an early run to the middle, but so long as you account for this (and make sure beers and snacks are in plentiful supply) that's not necessarily a negative, but it might affect how often you get this to the table.

I have a special place in my heart for this game.  I first played Talisman back in 2003.  A friend of mine owned an older version of the game and we used to play occasionally.  This was the game that made me realize that there are other board games out there.  Up to that point I had only played the mass produced games that permeate most shelves in a home, like Monopoly, Balderdash, and many others.

Talisman opened me to a whole new world of board games and to this day remains as one of my favorites.  It is a heavy game and can take quite some time to play, but that's one of the things I like about it.  Whenever I play this game I feel fully immersed in the story and take on the role of the character I'm playing.  There are very few games out there that have done this for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Whant can I say about a Board Game that has been around for 30 years and is still going strong? It's a Legacy in and off itself and in my opinion the best Fantasy themed Game out there, that entertains for hours in a session.

The Rules are simple and very easy to understand, the components are absolutely gorgeous with some neat Artwork and nice plastic miniatures. The replayability because of its randomness is huge and especially with 1 or 2 Expansions no Game will EVER be the same.

Some hardcore Gamers will not like the Game because so many things are made random by card drwaing and expecially dice rolling, but that is the fun of it and makes it more easy to play. If someone wants to play a longer game, but is intimidated by the Rules or strategy aspect (like in Arkham Horror) they may prefer Talisman.

In my opinion, this is one of the best and most influential Games ever made and I will play it as often as I can for years to come.

I bought the app on Steam so I could see what I was missing. The answer is, unfortunately, not much. Random movement, random monsters, random events, random combat. Plus, the game is way too long for the mechanics to sustain, and I'm only playing against the AI at a brisk clip. Combine that with the fact that if the dice and cards aren't with you, it will be a torturous session that lasts hours with no hope in sight.

I'm sure that my 9-year-old self would have played this with his friends on a sleepover into the wee hours of the morning and had a blast. But, for my adult self it just doesn't hold up, and I think a lot of the 7+ ratings here are based heavily on childhood nostalgia rather than a critical analysis of the game mechanics.

Anyway, something fun for the kids, but adults should pass.

Along with "Dungeonquest", one of the games I missed out on in the late 80's when I tragically fell out of board gaming.  I snatched it up pretty quickly when Fantasy Flight reprinted it.  Although random and goofy it's also easy to throw down and begin the adventure.  A great brain dead beer n' pretzels romp.

EDIT: Bought the ios app for a dollar and played it a couple times, remembered why I got rid of the board game and why even that isn't worth a buck. 

In the spirit of the game I'm changing my rating to the result of a d6... aw, bad luck, Talisman, apparently you suck.

Talisman is a blast!  I played with my wife and we soon realized two things:  First and foremost, playing with more than two people would greatly increase the amount of tension and competition in this game.  Second, it does NOT take as much preparation to go for the game's main quest goal as we originally thought.

Our playthrough lasted about two hours, but once my wife got to the innermost circle of the board, she pretty much just walked right up to the end goal.  

There is a good amount of luck-of-the-dice involved with this game, which is normally a turn off for me in RPG settings, but the simplicity of the rules and the beauty of the artwork makes it an asset as opposed to a deficit.  Reason being, a game like this is perfect as a stepping stone from casual games to heavy games.  There are plenty of elements you would find in a heavier game, but they are very simple and not at all overwhelming.  

The combination of this with the luck-of-the-dice aspects means that even a player new to board games has more than just a slim chance of winning.  This is great for their growth into the board gaming community and could be the difference between a bad night and the start of a new hobby.

Definitely recommend bringing this game out at a board game night with a new player and have your goal be to help fend off the other players to give them a fighting chance.

I'm pretty new to the Talisman party, but it's been insta-love. Yes, it's random. Yes, there isn't much strategy. Yes, it can drag (without some judicious application of house rules). But it's ridiculously fun with the right group who don't take it too seriously. I haven't obsessed over a game like this in a long time! I can see myself pulling this out for years when I want a light, fun dice chucking adventure.

I have to say now after some time and tweaking the game with expansions, this edition is now better than 2nd edition. But the 2nd edition is so classic, and some of the flavor and changes are not as good, the 2nd edition City is so much better, and lets not forget Timescape!

But the 4th edition did improve some things, importantly it brings more balance!

I think there is more balance in 4th edition, and partly due to fate. But Fate itself is also a positive addition on its own merit besides bringing balance.

Another negative is the board size. It's too big!

And while I can't technically fault expansions here under the main game I must make note, there are 1 1/2 expansions in 4th edition I do not like: Dragons & 1/2 of Blood Moon.

Dragons is too tough and just don't like the mechanics. Blood Moon, interestingly should be a favorite since I love werewolves, but I also have a distaste for the day/night mechanics, and the over all flavor of this expansion (I wouldn't say I hate it, as I almost hate Dragons.).

Dragons is fixable with variants and house rules tho!

RATING: 4.5
I finally decided to play Talisman after decades of staying away, and I have to admit that it was more fun than I expected.  The saving grace is that you have practically no decisions in the game, which means the game play goes more quickly than I expected from looking at all of the text on the board and on every card (there are hundreds of cards).  The combat system is also very clean.  That was unexpected.  Even so, it is an overly long game and I don't think it is very good.  I had fun, because there was beer, and I liked the people who were playing.  So if you try this beast, make sure you are playing with fun people.  Most of your four hours will be spent socializing and probably role-playing.

The newest edition of Talisman, from Fantasy Flight.  Having owned the first (B/W), second (colour) and third (skulls!) editions from Games Workshop over the years, I picked this up to play with my son.  Overall, it's the same old Talisman, with some slightly different spaces on the board, and a new Fate (re-roll) mechanic.  The character card art on the new edition is junky, but the art in the decks looks nice, and the cards seem sturdy.  Talisman is what it is, a random adventure luck-fest - control freaks will hate it, but for a family game, it's a gem.

Play a Sorceress, Chivalric Knight, Dark Cultist, or any of dozens of other characters vying for the Crown of Command at the center of the board.

Talisman is random and often brutal, but always epic.

Out of Runebound, Prophecy and this, I still think Talisman has the best overall Fantasy theme.  It's pretty to look at with wonderful components, and it has just enough interaction to not be boring.  It's not quite what I want in an adventure game, especially with the stupid quest for the crown, but it's pretty close and there are enough cards and expansions now to give the game some good variety.

The theme is fun, but the gameplay is so incredibly tedious and drawn out. When you spend an entire day playing this, and then die because luck wasn't on your side, it just isn't fun anymore.

Beautiful production of the classic adventure game. One of the best looking game BOARDS I own. It's important to recognize that this is more of an adventure game than a strategy game.  It reminds me of the old "Choose Your Own Adventure" books with the path options you can take.  Tremendously unpredictable, with some funny coincidences.  There is a wee bit of strategy, however, in terms of timing your push for the Crown.  Light, luck-filled and can be long, but has proven to be an excellent game to play with younger gamers as well.  To enjoy this game, you have to accept it for what it *is* rather than berate it for what it *isn't*.  The game certainly has a very strong identity and character to it.  It's pretty inspired in that way.  We always have fun playing it, and that's the bottom line.

The 4th and 2nd Editions:

Rating based on complete 4th and 2nd edition Talisman experiences with their expansions as well!

Great game! It plays like a role playing game that actually ends and has a winner. Lots of variations. Beware it lasts a long time! Own All 4th edition and 2nd edition expansions and versions except 4th edition base game and 2nd edition City and Timescape. Purchased while single, originally.

Fantasy Adventure Game.

i like this game every now and again. Theres not much going on. Pick left or right, roll, flip a card. What sells it is the variety of cards, characters and crap that comes with the game (even more with expansions). It can go on too long, and the best end game is the battle royale, which you can't garuntee. Im happy playing simple games where i flip pretty cards for a couple of hours.

This game really emphasizes the social glue aspect of board gaming. Its not about the game, but the people your spending time with.

Don't play with more than 4 players! the time requirements increase alot.

If you accept the roll and move mechanism, and that the outcome is entirely decided by luck of the draw and the die roll, this is a very fun adventure game. The artwork is gorgeous, and the material is decent.

Update:
I still think this game is fun, but it frequently overstays its welcome. House rules to shorten the game are recommended.

Played with my 3 daughters and after one game session my 7 year old was teaching new players the concept of the game. As my daughters friends played they started loving this game for the simplicity of the game which is the main reason for buying this nostalgic game from my past. BL brings the old edition back with style and new artwork, I would recommend this game to anyone for an easy game and yes it is a long game, but we all were having fun and so everyone stayed in the outer region a lot longer then an average game is played.
I bought this game to have a lot of fun with my daughters which is what it accomplished for me. The price is still right in the original ball park and is worth every penny since I do see alot of playing time with this game especially when BL starts kicking out the expansions for the game.
For all the Randomness of the game, every where you turn, I see randomness in life like a Football game where a top team gets beat by a defeated team and so that is just as random as this game is.

Supongo que en su momento habrá sido tremendamente original. Las cuatro partidas las he jugado de a dos y me convencí, quizás me equivoque, de que para sacarle el jugo hay que jugarlo mínimamente de a tres personas. Lo ideal dice BGG que es cuatro y puedo llegar a creer que sí lo es. De a dos se hace largo y si hay disparidad de características, los enfrentamientos casi que ni se dan. Pero no me desagradó en líneas generales. Supongo que funciona muy bien con niños.

I've played this about 3 times, without any expansions.  It is always feels like it is taking forever, and then it is suddenly over.  The only exception was the time we ended up with two characters in a duel that would nearly never end (one was disarmed and could regenerate, so he could neither do damage nor be hurt except in extremely unlike dice roll combos).

Some people might find it odd that I rate this so low when I enjoy Dungeonquest so much. The difference between these two games is that where Dungeonquest randomly punishes everyone, this game randomly punishes OR rewards them. So one player might be stuck as a toad forever, which would be hilarious if the other players were subject to similar drawbacks. But no.

The game is frustrating to lose because someone else is being randomly rewarded while you're being punished. And it's frustrating to win because there's always going to be someone at the table who's grumpy about being hosed. I've been in both positions, and neither are fun.

Game looks so much more awesome on the table than the actual experience.  I love how the board fits in with the expansions' add ons.  It's a gorgeous presentation.  
Still, I haven't played this in a while until Dec 2017.  The experience was okay, but there are so many better fantasy titles to play for complexity and narrative.  One of the biggest issues I felt during this last play through was the roll and move - and whatever you roll you must move.  I'm thinking I'm going to allow a character to move up to their rolled number to allow a bit more flexibility in what they do and where they go.  It will prevent this back and forth movement while trying to land on a specific space.  Truly, allowing movement to be more flexible will quicken the game and add more choice to your rolls.  Character combat will increase (knowing the people who play this game) and your ability to not walk by items or spaces that could benefit you is also eliminated.  
Might also try the idea that you can't move past monsters who are already on the board.
Games a 6/7 at best.  Some modifications will aid in its play.

Oh boy, Talisman you say?

It is so hard to rate. So many good memories. Countless evenings of my youth spent on adventures in outer lands. Back then it was absolute 10 for me. And now? Let's face it, there isn't a lot of game in Talisman - it is all about journey and telling story. Nonetheless I can see myself playing this occasionally; nostalgia is a powerful thing. 

Also, game which drawn my fiancee into boardgaming deserves my respect.

The game is almost entirely based on luck. Some characters are objectively worse than others. The theme is practically non-existent, and the game takes far too long to play. This is one of those games that has permanently ruined board gaming for many people.

Explain again why it's better to have "trophies" that you turn in for craft and strength, rather than have experience markers (as found in the 3rd edition) that you turn in for whatever you like (life, gold, craft, strength)? That's probably my only gripe so far (having only read the rules) with this version. It looks fantastic, I like the variety in the expansions, and I look forward to playing it.

This game gets a bad rap by a lot of people here, and I understand why. It's a long game with a lot of random events. But I love the multitude of characters and all the surprises! And the expansions make it so unpredictable that no game is ever the same. It's an epic adventure if you have the right personality for it, but you really do need the expansions to make it so you are not just wandering around in circles for two hours.

I understand some players's concern about Talisman's randomness and I never object to that. However, I feel the game become monotonous and boring after several plays.

The side board expansions provide more interesting gaming experiences but they present another problem: the game board becomes too big and player interactions are almost non-existant.

So I feel like this game could be fun to people. I felt it was very slow. Everytime my friends and I play it there seems to be a lull in the middle where no one is really achieving anything towards winning the game, and in the end we all just feel like it's Monopoly. One recent play had 2 of the players trying to kill themselves, and other players trolling them by healing them and keeping them in the game. It was pretty funny. 

I don't feel this is a bad game, I think that there aren't enough encounter cards to give people a chance to earn trophies. It's a lot of die rolling, but I feel like in the end the game just moves slowly. It's possible we're playing it wrong, and it's possible that everyone isn't attacking each other enough because we're too nice. But this game just felt very slow and dragged on.

Overall a really nice dungeon crawl type game however the roll and move movement mechanic means that there really is no way to plan what you are going to do you just move and hope you get a good encounter. 

I also find talisman (especially if you add expansions) overstays its welcome as it is very difficult in the inner world and sometimes it can take a lot of time to even gain the right equipment to breach the inner world. 

If this played in about 30 mins per player so a 4 player game lasted a couple of hours it would be fine and actually pretty good however it can drag on all day.

The game is very random. Initially I enjoyed it, the combat and cards work reasonably well, but on reflection the randomness isn't just the movement but the whole game.

Massive text reading.  Every stop on the read requires reading & the board is so large, if my piece was on the other side of the board had to have the other players read to me what was on the stops to the right and to the left before I could choose a direction to move.  

Lots of down time.  Since you don't know what others moves will be nor the roll of your die,you can't do much planning.  I just sat there waiting for my turn.

We played with 4, and often due to loss of multiple turns, it would be 6 to 9 opponent turns before I got another turn.  This happened to me over and over. That is just too much down time--can't imagine it with 6 players.

I can see playing this once a year.  Some of the expansions look good.

I've played this game for years. This is a fun fantasy game that most people can play for years without getting bored, especially due to the many expansions. It does have a pretty high learning curve to actually be able to win though. Even if you think you understand how to play the game, there are tricky things and points to know that can completely change your ability to win the game, and I think I had played the game for 2 years before I knew what those finer points were and really understood how to win.

Great old game with lots of fun memories.  Its a fun beer and pretzels outing for parents and kids or folks that don't normally game (and can enjoy a fantasy/storybook  theme).  It's a simple race game at heart to reach the center of the board.  You just roll a dice and read the instructions on the space you land in or on the cards you flip.   It's a breath of fresh air to play a game that's not a bunch of overlapping abstract mechanics that you have to groove your brain to 'get'.  It's just fun, creative storytelling with an RPG feel.  It's entertaining to see what happens to folks.  Fantasy Flight has done a great job with this game.  Enjoy the fantastic artwork and social aspects of playing this game!

RATING: 5
The most common complaint I read about Talisman I read is that it takes too long, too much randomness, too much just roll and move. And you know what, I would agree, though I would say the taking to long is a symptom rather than a problem itself. Because of the randomness of the encounter cards, players do not have much control over the growth of their character and because of this it takes much longer than it probably should to power up their characters enough to head towards the goal. At this point I don't think I'd choose this to play as a game. Instead I'd almost rather treat it like a toy of sorts, where I'm not really playing to try and win, but to wander around the board and see what happens to my character and at some point someone makes it to the middle of the board and it is time to put the toy away.

What's to say that hasn't been said before? Most of the game involves you playing second fiddle to the real star of the stage - the dice.

Talisman is the archetype of all fantasy games, a great classic, still it is mistreated by a lot of expert gamers because of its strong random component (indeed movement, fights, and everything else is decided throwing dice). In my opinion this game (first published in 1983) can still be an interesting option to pass a night with friends (a long night...). I personally like the atmosphere of Talisman, the cards (maybe a little too small), the illustrations, the characters. Expansions can mitigate some of the randomness issues, but sometimes I think that (adding too many new cards) the deck of Adventure cards may result unbalanced.

Initial thoughts are this is quite good for a slightly longer luckish based game with many bits but not too much thought - nice theme ties it all together (15/2/09). UPDATE: I still don't know about this game: It's way too long, almost hokey mechanic, too much luck, and yet does seem to have a story telling element even though you might have something go wrong that makes you replay the previous half hour, and yet, I still want to give it another go - rated a strangely compelling and repulsive at the same time 7 (7/12/11) UPDATE: Game I find too long, but the iPad app is great to make air travel pass quickly - rating for board game (Rating 5.823 Jan 17). UPDATE:  I don't think I would ever play the actual version of the game - simply too long for what it is.  And yet, the iPad app is brilliant to engage and invest in an epic long game on an airflight to make time vanish quickly (Rating 5.177, Aprl 2017).

I love Talisman! As a fan of the second edition (I own an almost complete set with expansion but it's in very bad shape because of dozens of plays) and after the horrendous third edition I wasn't sure what to expect but I fell in love with it after opening the box. Love the new art, love that it's very similar to 2nd edition and there is always something new to be experienced. With the right dosage and use of expansion this is just a killer game I love to play again and again! :)

RATING: 8
Good game, but takes a while to setup.  Play is better when players are familiar with game and can take turns quickly.  Fast play makes for a much better playing experience.  Kind of light on strategy, since all encounters are random, as are outcomes of battles.  But still a fun way to pass a few hours.This fourth edition is much better than any of the predecessors.  It totally ignores the awkward Third Edition and the art treatment is more akin to the Second Edition (SE) as well.  Some improvements to the rules have been made as well.  Feels like a perfected SE.

I am a fan of both Talisman and Runebound, and in my opinion they are both flawed gems. 

I definitely miss Runebound's scalable encounters. It's nice to know that your level 1 character won't stumble upon Margath, for instance, unless you're silly enough to go right for a red challenge.

Compared to Runebound though, I actually prefer the movement mechanic of Talisman. Sure, most of the time your choice is limited to two directions (or a third if moving to or from the Plain of Peril). However, in Runebound, movement is the most AP prone element of the game.

The real winning factor for me is the dynamic nature of the Talisman board. The realm itself changes.

Talisman is not for everyone. It is an old school adventure game akin to Gygaxian "make a saving throw or your 12th level character dies" AD&D. It can be brutal at times. It is not kinder and gentler, and it usually won't help one's self esteem. 

Talisman is beer and pretzel, not wine and cheese.

Notes on the 4th edition:  Tarted up version of the 2nd edition.  Bigger board, plastic chits (though hard to read without modification), nice bits holder.  The cards are nice but the font is somewhat small.  The rules are slightly tweaked from 2e.  At long last a crafty character can turn in craft monsters to increase their craft.  That's been a house rule for a long time.  Also, the new rules provide useful options/suggestions to speed up play.  If you have 2e, it's probably not worth the purchase.  Still I like the bigger board and nicer components.

It's impossible for me to rate this any lower, just for the sheer fun-factor of it. Is the game perfectly balanced? Probably not. Is it really luck-based? Well, kind of, yeah. Is it the most fun i've ever had playing board games? Yes, it still is!

The theme is the greatest ever, the artwork is incredible (the board is the most beautiful game-board I've ever seen), the confrontations between players are hilarious, the different encounters, quests, monsters, powers... EVERYTHING is just so much fun and feels so much like an adventure. It's just a blast to play, and i doubt anything will ever change that. "The greatest adventure is what lies ahead.", to quote The Hobbit.

RATING: 5
I want to like Talisman a lot more than I do.  It has some great ideas in it.  But without some careful house ruling the game is very poorly paced.  It's also punitive, sometimes in a fun way, but sometimes in a shitty way.  It's too long a game to roll a 1 on a six sider 3/4 of the way through and automatically die when the reaper lands on you.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3.5
Yup, the game is luck dependent, but this could have been fine. This is Talisman and not Chess. But for a fourth revised edition there are too many imbalances or evidently underdeveloped mechanics. Some characters are insanely overpowered while others are loosers. (Cultist, Assassin, Prophetess, Bounty Hunter on one side - Ghoul, Monk or sucker of suckers Priest on the other side)

Some items are a must have - Spell Book. There is so much pressure to have it, the game with City expansion should be renamed to "Spell Book" and the player to hold it for five turns should automatically win. BTW winning conditions are terrible. Dull, dull, dull, so very dull. Throw a die - nothing happened. Throw a die - 1 HP lost. Throw a die - nothing happened. Another OP item - heavy armour from the city in combination with Bounty Hunter = almost invincible character in combat. There are more thing like this - for instance all normal pieces of armour are rubbish. If you lose a fight they will steal your best item anyway.

Theme does not shine either. Imagine a hero (a troll for instance) with a horde of wierd fellows - mercenary, walking cabinet, gremlin, magic elephant, really small dragon, pixie, unicorn, gnome, old hag selling carrots, horse, a rather large herd of mules and a virgin. BTW, they are all flying a magic carpet.

Roll dice, stuff happens to you. Like 'Life' with monsters instead of mortgages and kids. I suppose it's a mindless way to pass time if I had nothing better to do, but so is Munchkin, and at least that has humor.

And since your movement is completely random (like Monopoly), there's no way to be sure it's *ever* actually going to end since you must land on *specific spaces* to do necessary things to progress. 90 minutes is *wildly* optimistic.

So required goals and no possibility to deliberately choose any of them. Like a 'choose your own adventure' where you don't actually get to do any of the choosing.

Random, random, random game that I can't imagine playing again except out of nostalgia...of which I have none.

Nice toad minis though.

When I found out this edition was being released, I quickly unloaded my two complete sets of the second edition on eBay for a hefty sum.
This version cleans ups some ambiguities, and adds plastic minis, which is always better than those cardboard stand-ups.

One that has made it's way back into my collection, and was sorely missed the entire time we went without it.

Currently the kids' #1 choice for adventure games. Somehow this old title really nailed it, and I feel it hasn't been done better or more effectively than Talisman. Simple mechanics, which have been cleaned up in this edition, with a bit more control over the dice rolls has made this game the absolute best at portraying the classic fantasy adventure (although some ambiguities in wording still made their way into the rulebook). It's by far the most random, and non-forgiving fantasy adventure game out there. But that's the reason I like it, and it's an excellent introduction to the world of gaming for non-gamers.

Expansions are pretty much a must with this title. The vanilla game will get tired after a few plays, and adding extra cards for variety will keep the game exciting. With the two small box expansions (Reaper, and Frostmarch) alone, the sheer number of cards these two little boxes add to the game will keep it fresh for years. The rest are just icing on the cake.
 
A must-have for any adventure game fan.

Just completed the collection with the final few expansions I was missing. This feels like the Grail version of Talisman if there ever was going to be one. It will be tough to top in both amount of expansions, and excellent designed components. Unless the next edition has some amazing differences and improvements, I don't see there being another Talisman better than this version.

So long FFG, and thanks for all the Talisman.

RATING: 8
This was my gateway game. Very heavy on theme, but it is executed very well. Wonderful components and artwork. The game is criticized for its randomness and lack of strategy, but experienced players can leverage the randomness in their favor. The randomness is also part of the fun in my eyes. Tons of incredible characters with unique abilities. Each game is like a unique quest all its own. Great as a relaxed, fantasy adventure with some friends, though it can get intense as you race towards the crown of command. Several excellent expansions breathe new life into the game by adding new mechanics and characters.

Great fantasy game. Can be a little cumbersome for new players, but is totally teachable. Randomness can be leveraged based on strategies, but is largely luck of the draw/dice roll. If you're open to going on a fantasy adventure filled with random encounters around every corner, it's a great game.

Good game of questing in a fantasy adventure setting as you reach to be the ultimate power.  Drawbacks are the high level of randomness (roll and move mechanic) and the fact once a player has the advantage the outcome if fairly predictable, which means the end-games sometimes (but on always) feel a bit flat instead of building to a climax.

I have never played any of the earlier editions of Talisman. I have seen the 4th edition advertised in trade magazines over the past while. Even though it looked kind of interesting I wasn't sure how fun it would be or how it played. This past weekend I was lucky enough to get in a game at a retailer's summit in Indiana. It was an incredibly fun game and all of us playing had a blast. I picked it up the next day. The only downside I noticed was the small size of the cards and the small text on them, but it wasn't enough to deter the fun

I've owned or played most prior editions of this game and I think this FFG version is the best to date. The game looks great, particularly with painted figures. Even the dice are cool. The fate mechanic puts guardrails around some of the game's wilder swings of fortune, proving especially useful when threatened with a toading, or if the Reaper (from the expansion) comes calling. Adding a bonus strength or craft at the beginning speeds things up, and often it's worth calling the game when the first player gets to the Crown of Command, so the game doesn't drag on so terribly as used to be the case. I wouldn't play it with more than three, and I wouldn't play it with my "sophisticated" game night pals, but my nine-year-old thinks this is the coolest game in the world, and when I'm playing with him, I'm inclined to agree.

D&D lite, but that is not a bad thing, it can take a long time to play it (2-4 hours with 6 players) and not to be played with extremely emotional people. (I still get reminded of actions that took place 3 or 4 months ago).
It involves a lot of luck, and can be frustrating for that particular reason specially if you don´t like dice-driven games, but I think that is one of the success of this game, its a game of chance at the end.
Now if they could only clarify the rules, this could be easy become a munchkin game if you are not careful.

Still fun to play after all these years.  Not recommended, however if your group is composed primarily of whiney man children...I'll not do that again!  http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/406081

I like the addition of fate tokens, which allow players to make a few more choices to mitigate chaos.  Also like some of the alternate rules to speed play, and recommend them with more than 4 players. 

Highly recommend adding the Reaper expansion, even if no other future expansions interest you.  It effectively doubles the spell and adventure decks, and is worth it for them alone.  The new heroes are very nicely done and very welcome.  The Warlock cards and the Reaper himself are interesing and optional bonuses, both of which are nice icing on the cake.  I will never separate out the character, adventure, or spell cards as they add so much to the base game.  The reaper and warlock I look at as nice options to add or remove as you please, though I'll never play without the reaper either, quite honestly.

Great looking game , in fact its slightly misleading ,the cover and the pieces are all so epic looking (especially when you take the time to paint the characters) unfortunately the game is not as epic. Its a good dice throwing game something to have a few drinks with and not take to serious and its not  hard to play. I think the end is the let down it should be an epic battle against some huge powerful monster/wizard/warrior it would make all the collecting of things seem a lot more important. My wife and I are playing,  I like it and will keep playing it.

On one hand I'm interested in playing it again, we didn't finish our first game.  On the other hand, I'm looking forward to see how this becomes more than a simple roll and move game.  It feels a bit like a D&D themed Chutes & Ladders game.

And yet, it seems like there's something there which I want to play.  I really want to try it again.

Edit:  Now that I've played it again (and finished) I understand that while it is a roll and move game it has a lot more theme to it than that.  It has some exciting moments, but there's also quite a feeling of "Can we just finish already!?"

UPDATE: "One of your followers is a werewolf. Roll a die. Turns out it´s the pixie! She attacks you". Har-har! 4-player with the Reaper expansion is wonderful silly fun. Upgrading to a 7.

///////////

UPDATE: Played a 2-player game with the Monk & Thief + Reaper. Monk won after 60 minutes after succeeding at absolutely everything! We used ending cards from Talisman Adventure. He got the Dragon King and of course he was out to lunch. Fastest victory I have ever seen. Craft at 12.

Rating based on Revised 4th edition. The best version by far. Fate tokens work, and the bigger character sheets is a huge boon for anyone who has trouble reading the text on 2nd edition. Best of all is the fine card quality and the minis. Worth getting.

Still a fan of Talisman despite what some may say. Outdated mechanics for sure, but still a ton of fun if you don't take things too seriously. It's a wild romp through a fantasy adventure game with characters that level up quickly as you go. Lots of rules customization to speed up the game if you need to. Have all expansions except for Firelands & Nether Realm (not interested enough). Collecting will be complete after The Woodland. Love the FFG remake of this classic. Look forward to having all the board corners complete...huge table hog though it may be!

Dripping with theme and every session really is unique. But it just takes too long. Not ideal when playing with "non-gamers" who don't enjoy the theme as much as I do.

The monopoly of RPGs, it is a must for every gamer. Very easy for everyone (kids, wife, etc) and they will love it from the first roll of the dice. Some says that it is totally random, but it is not! In every turn you have to take decisions like “is my craft enough to go deeper or should I take more experience by killing more monsters?”, “should I stay on this side of the board or should I go somewhere else with different cards dropped on the board” (when you draw cards sometimes they stay down like items, monsters, markets, etc... and the game board each time is different), “should I sacrifice my follower?”, “should I use one fate to reroll or to save it for future use?”, “should I use this spell now?”, “should I buy a sword or a helmet?”, “should I risk to attack the dragon to gain some strength faster or it is better to kill weaker enemies and grow slower”, “should I...”, “should I...”, “should I...”...Yes, you should... buy it and you will thank me for years of playing! Definitely 10...

It needs a 5th update similar to Arkham horror being shrink to Eldritch horror. Current playtime of Talisman is 3-4hrs. It needs to go down to 2-3hrs. Quite the design challenge I am sure.
Finally, the 4th edition was released in 2007 and its art needs updating. Talisman has everything to be a MONSTER game, but it isn't there yet.

RATING: 8
A classic game that brings back memories of the 80's. Great fun with the right people, but not to be taken too seriously. 

Also, the randomness of it makes for some extremely boring and/or unbalanced sessions as well as for epic races and hilarious moments. You just never know what will happen. 

Components are nice and the board is very atmospheric. All my minis are painted which adds to look and feel of it.

I just can't seem to get into it.  I find it kind of repetitive and the whole early dynamic a bit of a grind.  And it is very much the kind of game a single player can run away with, leaving everyone else treading water while waiting for him to officially win.  As another BGG member wrote, it's the worst parts of Monopoly and D&D combined.

Ah, the game that launched a thousand expansion (and a thousand depleted wallets.  It's an RPG - on a board!  Play with friends, stab friends in the back, lose friends.  Curse dice rolling.  Despise mystics and enchantresses.

A fantastic game played over 2-3 hours which sees you trying to reach the Crown of Command at the centre of the board whilst navigating the pitfalls, perils and odd stroke of good luck in a fantasy world where Warriors, Trolls, Wizards and Dwarves live (and fight) amongst each other.  

Mostly dice based but there's skill and luck and good decision making in this, one of my favourite games of all time and hopefully yours too.

An ace trade for F&G.
My friends like Talisman, my family like Talisman, my children love Talisman. So it seemed logical to get this final incarnation. I think my small offspring like 3rd ed a little more, due to the cartoony presentation. 
But after owning every edition over the years, buying the: over bloated, over produced, lavishest, behemoth edition, 
was a no brainer. And she is a real beauty!

Expansions, have all but; The Dragons. They are more, bolt on/bolt off's, than expansions. So you can tailor the game to your preferred adventure experience. A good way, I believe, to expand the masterpiece to its maximum, whilst still catering for all tastes.

A very fine story game, feels pretty heroic throughout. The roll-to-move mechanics however (particularly with the old "I want to reach this field, thus I iterate back and forth between the ones left and right to it") aren't really up-to-date, and the endgame feels oddly anti-climatic.

Still, a very nice game for 2 players, haven't tested it with more yet (I imagine it'll scale linearly when it comes to time, so it'll take a huge lot with more than 3-4).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
If you want something light on rules but which has an epic feel, this is it. The "roll and move" is an ingenious mechanic to simulate an adventure. In an adventure, the journey between two points is never in a straight line. No destination can be reached without unexpected encounters along the way. The obstacles on your path can be brutal. But this game is also a race, so you need to raise your chin, push your luck, and deal with what happens.

Talisman is an excellent antidote to that disease of mind in which people become overly fixated on control in games. Like any adventurer, you need strength of will and hope more than you need certitude of calculation and planning. There are choices to be made in the game to be sure, but they are like choice you face at a crossroads. Which path will you take? Will you play it safe or take a risk?

Talisman games are fast paced and simple, but they feel epic. They are unpredictable, colourful, and they tell stories that are often filled with dramatic reversals (and reversals of reversals). 

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Still a mindless, slightly long but fun romp with the right crowd, the cleaning of the rules is a good thing, altough I do not like the fate chits that much (and unfortunately, you cannot suppress them easily as they are a balancing factor between characters).
If you want to get the most of this game, add a layer of storytelling to it; don't just read the cards, weave a tale around them - a tale of evil or tragedy if you play an evil character, or a comedic tale of misshaps if the dice are against you!

I enjoy a lot of the beginning of the game. After a couple of hours of play, the rule to end the game sucks, especially with two players fighting each other for the crown. The one who wins the first battle has a greater chance to continue winning the rest of the battle by stealing the objects of the other.

There are so many that doubt Talisman just because it does not use the latest mechanics, that there is so much luck and randomness and other flaws... flaws that in my opinion give this game its essense and feeling of fun with a little frustration.

Talisman is about the story, about taking the game for what it is and about relaxing with a cool drink and good company. Its a game game that is great for all the family, young and old.

Although the rules at first look daunting this is a very easy game to grasp with a few basic movement, combat and aqusition rules. The rest of the rules are written on the board and cards....

Pull up a chair, grab a good glass of wine or some English Tea and RELAX!!!

An old classic, don't really keep up with these more modern classics of the genre but it's by no means a bad game. I would like to play it many times with a good number of players. One of the biggest problems of this game is the fact that its playtime rises expotentially when played with more than 2-3 players. It can easily become a way too long for the tastes of some.

RATING: 7
I can see the flaws with Talisman.  It's an old game (it must be - I remember wanting it when it was first released by GW), with roll and move mechanics that are way past their best-before date.  It can drag on forever.  It's random to a ludicrous degree.

The thing is, I really don't care. ;-)

Talisman, to me, is stupid, simple, unapologetic  fun. The fact that I can die on my very first turn with the unfortunate turn of a card and roll of a die? Hilarious. The fact that my oppoents can also be similarly squished? Even more hilarious.

A large part of this is, I'll admit, probably down to nostalgia.  That said, Talisman definitely scratches that dungon-crawling, loot-gathering itch quite nicely.

I recently finished painting all of the minis for the base game and The Reaper expansion and really most get some pics uploaded...

The 4th edition retunrs to fairly pure Talisman roots, but fixes a couple of things (fate tokens), and adds nicer artwork (if not as legible) into the mix to attract the eye.

Play is very like the 2nd ed Talisman I own still, and still prone to wild strings of luck.  But this was/is a classic multi-directional roll and move, and there have been many happy hours playing.

Bumped up a 1/4 pt for the good fixes.

Powoduje znaczny spadek zużycia alkoholu poczas spotkań ;). Momentami troszkę nudna, ale umożliwia knucie, kradzieże i zabijanie przeciwników w ramach rewanżu, lub wredne docinki, gdy wiesz, że nie mogą ci nic już zrobić. Chętnie zagram ponownie, nawet teraz.

EN: Awesome entertainment for 3-6 players (the more the merrier), which can last not only for hours, but even days. Causes a significant decrease in alcohol consumption during meetings ;). Sometimes a little boring, but it allows scheming, stealing and killing enemies for revenge, or vicious taunts, when you know that the opponents can't do anything to stop you. I will play again gladly, even now.

I never made it to the center of the board in all my plays back in high school. Probably because I was too timid, and some witch was always turning me into a toad.

As much as I would like to revisit this, I cannot shake that this is a roll-and-move; having the worst die-rolling skillz on the planet, this would be an exercise in utter futility. Well, someday I may revisit this, but not today, not tomorrow, not next week, and not next month.

Yes, it is random. But it weaves a nice story every time I play! Best with 3-4, although it is enjoyable even as a solitaire. Highly recommended for fantasy theme fans.  This new edition is much better than the 3rd edition and closer to the classic 2nd edition.  Personally, I prefer Talisman much better than Fantasy Flight's games with fantasy theme (e.g. Rune Bound, Descent, WoW).

[i][b]L[/b]ife is hard and the Gods are cruel; we toil for their amusement and even our best, most heroic efforts are but castles in the sand before the rushing tide. The Crown of Command dangles as a carrot on the end of a very beaty stick, existing only to see who will neck-stab whom for the illusion of control. We go now, doughty adventurers, hopping across this stage as toads to make the Gods—and perhaps ourselves—laugh. In the end, some lucky bastard will "win"—though he or she will most likely be consumed in capricious flames whence the curtain falls on this pointless shadow play.[/i]

[microbadge=2915]

This is NOT a nostalgia rating—I never got a chance to play this as a kid, teen, or college student.  Though I probably would have spent an awful lot of time doing so if I'd had the chance...

This is a GREAT nerd party/time-waster/beer, pretzels & potty-mouth game.  It has clumsy, outdated mechanics, "unfair" amounts of luck, and the ancient, tired and beaten-to-death [i]Lord of the Rings/D&D[/i] rip-off theme.

And I love it.

This is, in many ways, the Ultimate "Gone-Stupid" Game.  You can pull your brain out of gear and just coast along; it's one for those times when you would like to play a game, but life has hammered you down to the point where you just want to go "guh."

So roll a die, pull a card, read the result aaand...

ENJOY!

UPDATE:  Many people decry the random, binary movement system (roll a die and choose either right or left) but this simplicity is part of what makes [i]Talisman[/i] great—it's the only game of its ilk in which downtime is not an issue.  While [i]Runebound[/i] begins to drag at 3p (and becomes intolerable with any more), [i]Talisman[/i] can support the full compliment of players and the turns literally whiz around the table.  Roll, pick, do the thing, pass the dice.  It's almost a party game, it's so fast.

PS.  The new Fantasy Flight upgrade is fab!  Looking very forward to a whole mess of expansions...

UP-UPDATE:  With renewed family interest this has been hitting the table as a weekly event!  The good news, other than getting to play one of my favorite "weird storytelling" games, is that all the kids are hot to paint the scads of minis.  Several nights now I've gone to sleep only to wake to finished minis in the morning.  If you can engineer this effect for yourself I highly recommend it.

The only minor downer is that what makes this game fantastic is also the one thing that can kill it.  The utterly random element, so brilliant as a jumping-off point for spit-takes—like when the Leprechaun gets the Princess as a follower and ends up being lugged around in a front-facing baby carrier with a boob on each shoulder—can make the game excruciatingly slow when the cards don't come out in a useful manner.  After a couple of games of watching others level up ferociously while I got in multiple fights with a Royal Decree, three Horse Stables, several Bags of Gold, and a New Age strip-mall (the Mage, Healer and some dude hawking tie-dyed bedsheets decided to clog up the Hidden Valley), I've come to realize that more than anything else this game requires [i]stamina.[/i]
[floatright][imageid=1374144 small]
[size=7]Fig. 1 — [i]!!![/i][/size][/floatright]
With all the Adventure Cards from all the expansions, I'm thinking I might need to go through and trim the deck down to tighten up the game... though I'm conflicted, as [i]Talisman[/i] really is about embracing pure chaos and not every story should follow standard Fantasy tropes.  Sometimes it's okay if the Ogre Chieftain's saga is one of administration, finances and horse-trading.

[b]Recommended for Faster Play:[/b]

- Start the game with +1 Strength or Craft
- Gain Strength/Craft for every 5 points of trophies
- Remember that mechanically it's a push-your-luck race game without a timer—so push your luck and run that race as quickly as you can.  [b]Go for the inner region as soon as your Strength [i]or[/i] Craft is 9+.[/b]  On average this drives the game to a satisfying conclusion in about 90 minutes.*

[size=7]*Of course, True Fans see the lack of timer as a bonus, making [i]Talisman[/i] a fantasy bubble bath—complete with your favorite beverage and current love interest—to luxuriate in as you will.  Time means nothing if you love what this does.[/size]

I swore to never post here again after the inexcusable banning of Mike Barnes, but, I decided I had to post a rating for this game to counter the low rating given by a certain prolific reviewer.  Talisman is and always will be a roll and move game with simple combat determined by a stat modified by a die roll.  Anything else and it ceases to be Talisman and there would be no point in a re-release.  If you got a new chess set you wouldn't give it low marks because "the components are nice but the fundamental rules of the game are the same".  Its chess.  It is what it is.  This is the same Talisman game that has been loved by gamers since 1983.  If you don't like it, fine.  But, don't rip on it for being what it is or being something it isn't.  It isn't Runebound.  It's Talisman and it is great, if you like Talisman.

Roll dice, move unit, read card, gain or lose an attribute. Rinse, repeat. The process is redundant and bland. Plus it's indefinitely long for how random it is. It can make  a nice party game believe it or not with humorous situations that can arise. It's refreshing to have a certain dice roll in a game that leaves your character passed out drunk in a tavern.

Talisman is a game that I wanted to play for a long time before actually getting the opportunity to own it. Thankfully, the game pleasantly surprised me. It's not overly complex, has a good mix of strategy and luck, and doesn't punish you turn after turn for no reason. The fantasy setting makes the theme all the more fun. If you're looking for a casual romper filled with dragons and evil demons, then Talisman is the perfect game for you!

Okay, I know it's roll and move, and that it can be exceedingly and frustratingly random much of the time--but it's really the only build-your-own-fantasy-adventure-story in town (that's less consuming than the full-on D&D RPG experience, anyway).

There's a lot more strategy to this game than people give this game credit for--it's essentially a race game with everyone running along different shifting courses. 

If I'm in the mood to really fry my brain, Talisman kinda lingers sheepishly at the top of my closet--but if I'm in the mood for a rollicking unpredictable evening of light fantasy and dice-rolling, it jumps lovingly into my arms. Also--wife friendly (and I'm speaking of my wife in particular here--not at all claiming this is applicable to some undefinable set of "all wives")!

With the right group of people, this is a fun (mindless) game.  But really, when I read about people who LOVE this game but would rather die than play monopoly, I just wanna laugh.  I mean, Talisman, for all its chrome, is still just roll and move roll and move roll and move ad nauseum.

This is beer-and-pretzels adventure gaming. 

If you go into this expecting a test of skill, you're going to be miserable. More importantly, you're going to make everyone around you miserable. Knock it off. You're looking for Mage Knight or Magic Realm, both being awesome games that heavily reward skill.

Tips for success:

* Play quickly.

* Stop stressing out over things you can't control, which will be most things.

* Cheer for your opponents' successes. 

* Enjoy the ride.

This is a great board game for up to 6 players.  The game is really long and can take up to 4 hours with 4 players, but you can tweak the rules a bit to make the game go by faster.

Because of the dice this game can be very unforgiving to you, things can be going good an because of a roll of the dice it can go bad at the end and take forever to finish.  I like dice, I like random, the idea works most the time in the game and helps put an adventure on a game board.  But because of the dice it can really stretch a game on forever…really needs a timer to it.

Initial Rating: 8.0 (May 2010)

LOVE the theme, Talisman was once in my top 10 and was one of the first games I played. In general, I don’t like games with a lot of luck, especially if they take a long time to play (as Talisman does) but I can make an exception here due to the great theme the game has, it also has tons of adventure cards so each play is different. The miniatures are very detailed and in general the components are great. On the bad side, the main mechanic is roll and move, also there are some characters that are really weak. 

So if you are looking for a game with deep strategic thinking go somewhere else, but if you are looking for a light random game (which takes a long time to play) here is Talisman.

There was a time I really liked Talisman, however nowadays, I almost never want to play it. It has so much luck and it can take a long time to play, that I prefer to play other games.

Goes on a bit too long for what it is -- I'd prefer to see a few more useful events and fewer bags of gold.  But there's a fun factor here.  Probably would be best played solitaire with a few different characters; at least then there would be no downtime.

This game teases with an epic feel but it falls short.  It's slow and uneventful and doesn't require much thought.  It's a light game so it's easy to play while carrying on a conversation about anything else.  It's almost like elevator music...it can just happen in the back ground.  With that said, I enjoy playing it.

Amendment:  With all the expansions this rating goes up to an 8.

Classic boardgame
and one of the first games got me into the hobby,
i played this one when i was 16 and i was amazed back then!
It has many many flaws but still it can be a really fun game(more likely with the additions and the variety from the expansions).
I also love the early universe of games workshop
So thumbs up from me 
for the grandfather of light adventure games!
The only thing that keeping me away from playing it more often
is the fact that takes A LOT of time for such a game!

I understand the nostalgia people attach to this game, but boardgames have come a long way since Talisman's creation. Talisman is about rolling a die and moving around the board to collect things, hoping to not land on hazards. It's Monopoly but with dragons.

Good concept, but poorly executed. Rolling for movement is a beating and results in a feeling of extreme repetition. The design, artwork, components, etc. are all good quality, but the gameplay itself is just too plodding and clunky. We didn't even bother to finish the game--not likely to be playing this again.

RATING: 7
Enjoyable! Reminds me of the computer-game Diablo where you collect weapons and equipment in the battle against monsters. One negative side: If you become weak (less strength or craft then your opponents), then the game has no way to balance the difference. So once weak, always weak...

Ignorance is bliss as I have no previous experience with earlier editions of this classic/nostalgic game of roll'n move mechanics.  Talisman (BI) 4th edition is a beautiful game to behold.  I really like the look and feel of the gameboard and cards, though we've since replaced the cardboard cut-out characters with D&D metal minis and green glass beads for Frogs.  (It surprises me that a game in its 4th edition still remains full of misprints and errata)    

All in all, considering the randomness of this game and accepting the 'roll'n move' mechanics for what it is, we enjoy playing Talisman very much.

UPDATE:  Talisman Prologue for iPad = a very happy camper, however, still no 'save' feature to date...

Without any childhood nostalgia to fall back on, Talisman feel pretty flat for me. The FFG production is typically great. It's not that I'm above a roll-and-move game, but the session just dragged out for much longer than it ought to have. I do like the bit about turning into a toad and the frequent opportunities to screw with other players (theft, spells, combat, etc).

The high luck factor is what hurts this game for me the most. It can get a bit repetitive at times especially when you cannot get the right cards to move up a level.  The components are amazing in this version of the game.  If you strip the theme you end up, in my opinion, with a number crunching dice fest which makes this very much a take or leave it type of game for me.

Lots of changes and house rules needed to make this game playable in an hour or two. Original game drags on forever. Most important changes are: no Command spell first to the crown wins, level upgrade at every 5 experience not 7, and experience when beating other players as well, equal to their strength or craft. These changes speeds up the game. Still a bit too repetetive , though.

I understand people love the 'epic quest' feel of it, but there's just not a good enough game here to keep me interested for more than 45 minutes. 

After 3 plays I can honestly say I'm planning to actively avoid Talisman in the future.

RATING: 6
In the more than 30 years since the publication of Talisman roll-and-move has all but disappeared as a mechanism. Getting re-published nonetheless is a testimonial to the strengths of the design as a fun passtime. I wouldn't break out Talisman in a group of jaded eurogamers but it's suited for casual gaming when players don't want to think much and just be entertained for a few hours.

When the time is right, and you want nothing more than to be screwed over by the cruel hands of fate, you should play Talisman. Talisman has a roll-and move game mechanic that everyone is familiar with, but the theme and the difficulty of the game is what makes it special.

Random to the point of being absurd. It's snakes and ladders with a weak fantasy theme. It's barely a game at all. It only gets high ratings out of some bizarre 80s nostalgia, for new players there is simply nothing here.

My biggest problem with this game is that you lose so many turns. It seems like a game mechanic that doesn't anything into the game (but time).

Dice chucking madness, D&D meets monopoly.

I bought this for nostalgia's sake as I loved the earlier version as a kid. I wish I hadn't gone back to it. The game is far far too random, the theme is fun typical high fantasy and not amazingly well done, the tweaks in the latest edition help mitigate randomness a little bit, but not enough. Not one intelligent decision to be made, this is a game requires you to just roll the dice, pick from two options, and roll again. Occasionally there is an obviously right decision, otherwise it is just a pointless dice fest. Serious runaway leader problems since you cannot do anything to the winning player unless the dice roll lets you catch them!

Good to keep yourself amused while watching an average movie and with some beers is about as good as it gets. 3 points for theme, art and components.

RATING: 7
Roll and move, runaway leader and the sheer randomness of the loot (you flipped a dragon and lost a life while i got a ring that gets me +1 in strenght and craft? Bad for you) are the weak part of the game.
Despite all this is still fun getting around the board upgrading your dude or dudette. Stick to a strategy (keep around the tavern to get to the temple, or to the village to buy an axe, or to the city to encounter the enchantress etc) and race to the crown!

Why to play Talisman if there's Prophecy?

I was playing it last time 15 years ago. Recently I bought it again and now can spend like 6 hours on Saturday to only enjoy playing Talisman.
The base game is fine although can be quite short to paly cause of not many Adventure and spell cards. Once you add at least 1-2 expansions, game become more and more interesting and exciting!

Played this for nostalgia's sake, and not quite as fun as I remembered.  Most of the fun at the table was just the banter and the people I was with, after the first hour we were all ready for the game to just end.

Always wanted to play as a teen, but the games took forever and often went unfinished. Don't think I ever won.... Years later, purchased new edition and tried it once. Felt incredibly tedious and surprisingly boring! Would have given it a shot with some variant rules if the components were more attractive. Seems to be a cash cow rather than a product of love, which is shameful really.

Great theme, but the updated artwork and style is only skin deep. At its heart, Talisman is still and 80s-style roll and move game. Lots of downtime between turns, and meaningful decisions are too sparse relative to the game's length.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I kick ass at this game--unfortunately, I have solved Talisman and it is no longer interesting to me.  The solution is as follows (spoiler alert!):

If your alignment is good, always move to the right.
If your alignment is bad, always move to the left.
If your alignment is neutral, alternate moves from right to left.

Neutral is the hardest to play as you have to remember, "Did I move right or left last time?"

But once you figure this out your friends might as well pack up and go home, cuz it's game over, y'all: COMMAND SPELL ZZZZZZAAAAAPPP!!!

In all honesty, my 7 rating is all about the escapism that Talisman offers.  And you better be damn sure to do everything in your power to escape, cuz I'm seriously gonna COMMAND SPELL your weak ass into oblivion. ZZZZAAAPPP!!!

Ezt a játékot nagyon sokan nem szeretik a társasjátékos közösségben, mert a csak "megyek körbe és körbe és körbe, tápolódom, és majd lesz valami 6 óra múlva" bélyeget nyomták rá.

Van némi igazság a fent leírtakban, de csak abban az esetben, ha robot mód játszák az emberek.

Miért ne lehetne egy könnyedebb, akár fél napos játékra leülni az asztal mellé, közben társalogva, nem állandóan a komoly gémer játékok adta következő 3-4 körön gondolkodva agyégetve meghalni :)

Tehát le is írtam a lényeget: ez nem egy gémer játék. Megint csak a "kalandozós" játékok egyike, amit például fel lehet dobni azzal, hogy a felhúzott lapokat a másik játékos - átéléssel! -olvassa fel neked, ezzel kicsit szerepjátékosabbá téve a történetet.

This is the first fancy board game i ever bought and it did not dissapoint me. The rules were easy to wrap your head around (at least for most of my friends) and it is really fun once you get used to focusing on your character(the items, stats etc.). That may take 2-3 games to get used to but it's all good. Sadly though the game is bound on luck  in most cases and, if a player gets lots of monsters and levels up well there is nothing you can do about it. He will probably steamroll you but it's all fine. One thing you want to do is encourage your friends to pvp. It adds a lot to the game. The characters are not in a rock paper scissor kind of relationship but sometimes you can't counter them. For example if you have low strength and you can't psychic combat the Troll will pwn you. The miniatures are beautifully sculpted. The art on the board and the cards are very nicely drawn.

Although initially attractive for those who like the fantasy theme, you quickly realize that's just a sophisticated version of the Game of Goose.

I love the theme and there is a lot to like in terms of presentation, interesting events and choices, risk management, character leveling, and the way these elements combine to make game feel like an epic story is unfolding.

Own the digital version and played roughly a dozen games with/without various expansions. Fun little roll & move push your like type of game. Very limited in  strategy but can be tactical (things are very volatile in this game). Wouldn't recommend playing with more than four unless everyone has most cards/spaces memorized otherwise the game can over welcome its stay very quickly.

It´s simple and many people say it´s just a gateway-game for newbies. Well, it was indeed for me when I was young. But it is still one of the best fantasy-boardgames I ever played. It IS the simplicity and elegant game mechanism that makes me love it. The character management, well, it isn´t nearly as interesting as in WoW:BG and there is no such storyline like in Runebound - but it has cool character arche types, you can use items and magic spells, the game is fast paced... and there isn´t that much of downtime like in WoW or Runebound. Complexity is not always the best way. The game can be as long as WoW or Runebound (the endgame...) - but the player actions are done a LOT faster. Or said in other words: You play the same time as with WoW or RB, but you have done much more WITHIN this time... Well, if there wasn´t that much of randomness and luck... but that was the feeling of games in the 1980s :) I still like it very much for casual play.

This was my gateway game. Very heavy on theme, but it is executed very well. Wonderful components and artwork. The game is criticized for its randomness and lack of strategy, but experienced players can leverage the randomness in their favor. The randomness is also part of the fun in my eyes. Tons of incredible characters with unique abilities. Each game is like a unique quest all its own.  Great as a relaxed, fantasy adventure with some friends, though it can get intense as you race towards the crown of command. Several excellent expansions breathe new life into the game by adding new mechanics and characters.

Great fantasy game. Can be a little cumbersome for new players, but is totally teachable. Randomness can be leveraged based on strategies, but is largely luck of the draw/dice roll. If you're open to going on a fantasy adventure filled with random encounters around every corner, it's a great game.

The burrito boy (age 7) likes this.  Me, not so much; I will [i]always[/i] suggest Prophecy instead.  The difference between this and Prophecy is that in Talisman, you're a spectator, watching to see what happens as the game plays itself; in Prophecy, you're actually competing with the other players, planning several turns ahead and making choices about how best to get what you want.

I don't know why I am enamored with this game.  It does show it's age, but then again it allows for many simple modifications to make it from an ok game to a great game.  Is it a fair game. No, no it isn't.  But that is the intention and spirit of the game.  There are ways to change your luck, such as if you get bad character, just become reckless and kill him off.  Then you get a new one.  The dungeon expansion helps in this regard.  Anyway, I just keep coming back for this one every once in a while.  It has it's place.  That and it beats Monopoly in the roll and move department.

RATING: 6
Egyetlen félig lejátszott játék alapján a véleményem röviden: gyönyörű a tábla, de túl kevés a cselekvési lehetőség. Interakció van (amikor ugyanarra a mezőre lép két játékos, akkor harcolnak, meg - ki tudja? - talán spéci varázslatokkal vagy képességekkel vagy mezők hatásaival is lehet egymásra hatni, de túl kevés. A játék elég összetett, sok érték és tulajdonság van, sok varázslat, sok kártya, tárgyak, minden - ez így jól hangzik, de egyszerűen túl kevés a cselekvési lehetőség.

Amikor rám kerül a sor, dobok a kockával, és balra vagy jobbra (ezt én dönthetem el) annyit lépek, amennyit dobtam. Ez itt egy döntési lehetőség (mármint hogy merre menjek), és itt kb. vége is a sornak. Ahova megérkezem, ott vagy van már valamilyen lap a mezőn, pl. egy szörny, és akkor harcolok vele (dobókocka + módosító értékek), vagy húzok egy lapot, ami a következőként az adott mezőre érkező játékosra fog hatni (általában), vagy a mező speciális képességét hajtom végre (ami általában szintén kockadobás-alapú, pl.: 1-et dobsz: kimaradsz a következő körből; 6-ot dobsz: kapsz egy aranyat). Ez így elég kevés önálló, meghatározó döntés a játékos részéről (sőt, szinte semennyi), és ez a játék nagy hibája.

Megjegyzendő még, hogy a tábla kifejezetten nagy méretű, és rengeteg felirat olvasható rajta, amiket el is kell olvasni. Gyakran előfordul, hogy olyan szöveget kellene elolvasni, ami a tábla túlsó felén, apró betűkkel, fejjel lefelé található. Ilyenkor vagy oda kell menni hozzá (ehhez körüljárható asztal kell), vagy megkérni valamelyik ott ülő játékostársat, hogy olvassa fel a szöveget. Idővel persze fejből is megtanulja az ember, hogy melyik mezőre mi van írva, és azt is, hogy melyik mezőn lévő kártyalap mire szolgál, így nem kell olvasni, de ez messze nem az első játék alatt történik meg.

Amúgy szívesen végigjátszanám egyszer, mert kellemesen eltelik az idő a játék körül, de hiányoznak a döntési lehetőségek, és azok súlya, ezért nem lesz igazán jó ez a játék. Játszható, könnyen bele lehet jönni, mert a hosszú és összetett szabálykönyv valójában egyszerű mechanizmusokat és szabályokat tartalmaz, de nem egy év játéka.

Feeling adventurous? Play Talisman! Fun game with great components. Based heavily on luck though (you roll dice on everything), but you still can make some choices. There's plenty of game in this, but if that isn't enough there's also several expansions to expand your experience! Only fits specific situations and moods though, as the only skills you need in this game are risk management and calculating your chances. This game is maybe more about the journey than the destination.

Si te gustan los juegos de rol, si jugaste al Hero Quest, si te apetece pintar figuras (y se te da bien), aquí tienes Talisman, un juego donde podrás elegir entre más de 10 personajes distintos (mago, enano, guerrero, troll, hechicera, sacerdote...) con sus respectivas figuras y particulares y específicas habilidades especiales para recorrer el peligroso mundo de Talisman (una versión fantástica del juego de la oca) en el que tendrás que usar tu fuerza y astucia, tu espada y tus conjuros para hacer frente a eventos adversos, feroces enemigos y maliciosos rivales que harán lo imposible para evitar que entres en el valle de fuego, te hagas con la corona de mando y elimines al resto de rivales, siempre y cuando no seas convertido mediante una maldición en un viscoso sapo.
Y es que Talisman te hará pasar muy buenos ratos en épicas partidas donde puede pasar cualquier cosa y cualquier jugador puede ganar, ya que es un juego de dados, y el azar, ya se sabe, es caprichoso; no es por tanto, un juego de grandes estrategias en el que estrujarse el cerebro, no es un juego de jugadores, sino un juego para todos los públicos, divertido, ameno, y que anima a seguir jugando probando todos los diferentes personajes de que dispone, lo que aumenta su rejugabilidad,potenciada tambien con las diversas (hasta el momento 4, aunque todas en inglés) expansiones del juego.

RATING: 7.5
Played with 6. The game is very random, one player WILL get screwed over, either by the cards or by the other players. If you learn this game, there is alot of downtime. It wasn't until everyone gave up trying to do strategies and just went with the flow a bit more, that gameplay started to get faster. Also, we didn't wait for one player to completely finish his turn, when the next one started rolling for his. At one point 4 players were doing their turns at the same time, result was a bit messy, but much more fun than waiting it out every turn. There isn't that much that you can do to mess it up that way, except with casting spells and landing on the same spot, and being ex-Magic players we just treated that all as a twisted form of "the stack". Works for us, made the game enjoyable. 

Would be a 6 if you wait the turns out, 7,5 as it is right now with the turns through one another and the fast play-speed.

It's fun developing a character, but you can just go round the board endlessly doing so if you're unlucky.

So I like the concept of the game (getting stronger and conquering all) and the fantasy theme, but not the amount of time it takes, compared to the depth of the game.

(After one play with 5 people and 3+ hours, not even having a winner, 'cos we had to call it a night.)

RATING: 9
It is a random game, I give all the haters that, but when does "random" became automatically "boring" or dull. 

Yes, The Game of Life and Monopoly use dice,but the comparison stops there. Monopoly is a negotiation game at heart, I "like it", The Game of Life is totally about randomness without an apex of theme or any strategy, tactics or engaging elements whatsoever. Sure, games like Agricola are "manageable" and stragetic, and the choices are up to you all the time, and when you play it without the cards, the game is practically random-less,  but not only the mechanics or the strategy make a game fun, engaging and/or interesting. At least for me. 

Talisman does that exactly, it engages me in a quest where random events happen and where a bad roll will kill you, but the game is so easy, so light and so FUN in the clearest of terms that I REALLY DON'T CARE. The game is awesome and I look forward to play it lots and lots of times, the variety in the main box is awesome and even when the fixed board and the 14 heroes become old (even when that seems a great number, in a game where 1-2 players die each game, the number becomes small)  and the game  becomes a little bit repetitive after some plays, again I don't care, because I'm $15 from a huge variety (small expansion) or $30 away from a whole new world (large expansion). By the way that's why this is a 9 (if you were wondering) because the game need expansions and I don't mind buying them.

A definite new jewel that feeds to my AT needs.

My disappointment with this game was staggering. I remember drooling over the ads for Talisman in Dragon magazine when I was a teenager, and if it wasn't for Games Workshop's (at that time, anyway, justifiably) exorbitant prices I would have snapped it up eagerly. It was so pretty, and looked so cool.

I cannot describe how happy I am now that I didn't. It's not far from being a Monopoly variant, only the downtime is worse and you don't even have the appeal of making money (well, a gold here and there, but that's it). All it has going for it, in comparison, is some extremely nice art, albeit in a style I'm no longer drawn to, and the ability to choose which direction you want to go. Otherwise, it is a bog-standard roll-and-move game with a rather dull combat system pasted on. It is entirely possible to be dropped in an enormous hole by the dice, at which point you need a huge stroke of luck to rescue you from getting the crap beat out of you by the luckier players. It doesn't even finish any faster than Monopoly.

Maybe the biggest disappointment of my boardgaming life.

It is what it is. I love it for what it is, but I understand everyone who does not like the game. I like the randomness, the epic story that is stupid and funny and grandios.

Have this with the 4 corner board expansions and love the epic adventure it gives.  Feel free to make the games less painful by taking the horrible cards out, and put them back in play if you want to play competitively.  Whatever the case, enjoy a new experience every time.  My all time favourite board game!

Like the new set.  Production value of the art is high, but I still like the Wayne England art in 3rd edition a bit better--the art on the new main board outer region could have had a lot more character to it (see the new dungeon board for a good example of what they should have gone for). They have some good new rules (Spells) and surprisingly allowed you to turn in craft monsters for XP(!?). They did a very good thing leaving the characters unbalanced and not genericizing the whole lot like 3rd edition did.  Elf and Dwarf are still next to useless but the rest are a good selection.  Picked up the FF Reaper, Upgrade kit and Dungeon and it's cooking with gas so far.  A few very strange decisions (monk, warhorse, raiders nerfs) but other than that FF has this back on track.

I didn't love the original Talisman(s). But I have high hopes for this on some snowy brainless Winter afternoon.

Got it for like 20 bucks or less, including shipping.

I want to rate this higher but I play too seriously for a game that can really randomly kill you without warning.  Once someone pulls ahead unless they get a bad draw they will win and even if they do get a bad draw that may not be enough.  Too luck based for me unfortunatly.  Love that its reprinted though.

This game is more about the experience than anything else.  Sometimes the experience is rich and rewarding, but other times it's not.  It really depends on the card draw and some of the other luck elements.  This lack of consistency is a pretty big flaw.

For a roll-and-move game of square blobs, Talisman certainly makes you feel like you're in a fully developed fantasy world.  Maybe it's because the tropes are so familiar, but still so appropriately rendered.  Luck is a cruel mistress in this game, especially when trying to enter the next circle, but that is largely mitigated by the incredibly fast turns.  Combat is a breeze as well.  Really, only spell-casting can slow the game down.  The larger number of characters is cool, offering plenty of strategy in games to come.  Good and solid fantasy board-gaming.

I find my feelings mixed on Talisman, and I often compare it to Monopoly for nerds.  It's a once a year endeavour at best, which I usually wind up remembering the aspects I dislike about it, waiting for the game to end after 5 hours of rolling and restarting.  Set aside at least 5 hours if you're going to play.  I played a lot before getting on BGG and I NEVER got done in fewer than 3 hours.

bought this, because it's oh so beautiful...

2012-11-01: Best described (and in accord with my feelings) in Polyhedron Collider Review: " It’s a game in which the winner or loser doesn't really matter it’s the journey that makes this game fun. I just wish it wouldn’t take so bloody long. "

2014-10-10: I guess I finally grew too old for this game. If I want to spend 2 hours gaming, I mean it - I do not intend to do two-hour grinding with no results, and then call it a game because the time has run out. 

I may still keep it, but I doubt I'll play it in the next half a year.

RATING: 8
I don't think I've ever played a game the enjoyment of which depends so much upon upon its players' states of mind. 'Cause, yeah, the common complaints on the Geek about TALISMAN are right on the nose - it takes way too long for even a fairly devoted set of gamers, and the roll & move mechanic can easily become almost grindingly tedious. But if you're playing with a group of people who have all prepared themselves to look past this stuff, then the gorgeous and cleverly differentiated ways in which each character gradually gains strength and resources, and the subtle shift in stakes as they start to enter the inner circles of the board, can make for a totally absorbing and suspenseful four-hour session. 

Plus, the components really are beautiful. People have said a lot about the figures on here, but what really stands out for me is the card art, which is always worth taking a second look at and can really be useful in establishing mood.

RATING: 5
An old game updated by Fantasy Flight where you start on an outer ring and roll and move.  You get a card which can be a monster, treasure or an event depending on the space.  Once you have increased your abilities, you can move to a second smaller ring.  You keep rolling and moving until you make it to the inner ring.  Once there you can attack all other players, where they can lose a life.  If all other players are eliminated, you win.  

Long, tedious and boring.  But, it can be fun if you know what you are getting into and understand that it is based on luck and is pretty light. A good game to play with friends who don't really want to do anything heavy.

I'm OK with the concept for Talisman - a roll-and-move adventurge game, but the game stumbles a little in the execution. The monsters on the different levels are all drawn from the same deck - no variety there - and it feels alomst impossible to stop someone once they reach the Crown of Command, so the end of the game feels like a foregone conclusion. The game is nevertheless fun on occasion, and I'd be interested in trying both past and future editions to see if there's any improvement.

This is a game that has steadily grown on me over the years.  I wasn't one of those people that grew up with the game, I only recently discovered it around 2010, but even without the nostalgia factor, I've grown to love it.  A lot of people misjudge the game as a simplistic "fantasy monopoly" where there is zero strategy or depth.  This couldn't be any further from the truth.  The game is deceptively deep and engaging if you take the time to understand it.

Unlike Runebound, the world of Talisman becomes more and more interesting with time because monsters, treasure and events begin to populate the world.  Expansions just add to the experience.  Every time I play, I feel like I'm going on a real adventure in an awesomely beautiful fantasy world (best card art of any game I own), with lots of freedom and multiple goals to undertake.

I could go on and on, but suffice it to say, Talisman is a gem that delivers an fantasy epic story with simple mechanics in a reasonable amount of time that works for your whole family.

Must have expansions are: The Reaper, The Dungeon and The City.  I also own The Highland, The Woodland, The Sacred Pool, The Harbringer, and Cataclysm.

You never know whats gonna happen in this game, which makes it fun.  Also I'm a sucker for fantasy themed games.  Its very hard to make a come back when far behind, and winning is based on dice rolls and card draws, not decisions.

Was a big fan of the 2nd edition Talisman when younger (recurring theme - older cousins). We were turned off by the 3rd edition and when the 4th edition is pretty much a 2nd edition clone the kid in me took over and I got a good deal on ebay after a few months of release.

Not as fun as I remember but still and enjoyable game for both gamers and non-games who don't mind a longer game if player vs player conflict is high.

RATING: N/A
Talisman is a cult classic board game with a fantasy theme. There are 14 characters a player can control, from the heroic Warrior to the powerful Sorcerer. In this perilous adventure, play centers around the journey of these gallant heroes to find and claim the Crown of Command, a magical artifact with the power to destroy all rivals and make the bearer the true ruler of the kingdom. Only with strength, courage, wisdom and a few good dice rolls will players be able to survive the ultimate test and beat their opponents to victory.

The Cataclysm expansion is a must-have 

House rules:
1) leveling up requires one more points of Strength/Craft trophies than your current Craft/Strength, but never more than 7,
2) If you only have one Talisman in your possession, it cannot be taken/stolen by another  character.

3) If a character dies mid-game, the replacement character inherits all his Craft/Strength points, and one Talisman of his choice, (if the previous  character had one in his possession ). 

4) Every character starts the game with a random Warlock Quest card.

Based on one three player game with the Reaper expansion. 

This game is long. Our 3 player game lasted 5 and a
half hours. I'm guessing we could have tackled the inner regions earlier than we did, thus shortening the game, but I think the game still would have been a
good four hours. 

That said, I liked it! Better than Runebound; it "feels" more like a long quest interspersed with good and bad encounters. It had loads of flavor and narrative. I am a sucker for high fantasy and for Ameritrash games, so my bias in this case is clear. 

Turns move fast. Little downtime. There is a lot of "screw your neighbor" to Talisman, so anyone who doesn't like this sort of thing should steer clear. 

I had a good time playing. We'll see how it ages; I liked Runebound at first, but my opinion of that game has slowly declined over the last couple years.

Ahh Talisman. I actually don't really dislike you (as the score would suggest). And maybe you just need time to grow on me a bit more for a better score (or maybe expansions?).

But the base game is just average. Felt like the game took a little longer than it should have. I enjoyed what was there but rehashing some of the movements constantly weighed me down.

I love the fantasy theme...the artwork...everything about it. I even don't mind the roll-and-move part...but it just feels like something is lacking. Not sure what yet.

Played an advance copy at DragonCon.  It is the return of the 2nd edition but with much MUCH better artwork.  Since 2nd ed is the best iteration of Talisman in my opinion, this makes me very happy.  I am also filled with joy knowing that soon, the ridiculously high Ebay and Troll & Toad/Sheriff & Frog prices for 2nd edition will plummet as 4th edition does to it what the FFG versions of Arkham Horror and Fury of Dracula did to their predecessors. 

Update:  I own a copy now and after having played it several times, I am pleased to report that it is as great after multiple plays as it was the first time at the convention.  Also, shouldn't there be a rule that if you have never played a game, you shouldn't be allowed to review it?  Oh well, what do I know?  I'm new here.

Game of my childhood. Spent tens of late hours playing it with my friends. Pulled some all-nighters as teenager, did some 24-36h plays in college. Two decades passed, 4th edition is out, nothing has changed, still love to play it!

Original is definitely Light-Medium and boring after few plays. Sooner than later You'll start to flirt with the expansions and user-upgrades and that's when the real game starts. Definitely product for creative ones.

Wait for the polish unofficial "Vision" mod, should be translated till the end of 2013.

RATING: 7
Holy shit, this game is too long. Our first game was four hours, and the first three were great. Not knowing what to expect from the middle and inner rings, we mostly dorked around on the outer ring, learning the ropes; tons of fun, except for the one player who got screwed for 75% of that time by bad die rolls.

Once we hit the middle ring in earnest, the last hour was pure pain and boredom. The player who made it to the crown didn't have fun, because his turn was reduced to one 50/50 die rolls, and randomness soured almost everything at that point. I spent many, many turns not rolling what I needed to hit the damned portal.

75% fun + 25% I never want to play this again = I see the fast-play rules in our future if this one hits the table again.

After a second game, that's more like 40% fun + 60% hell. It's roll and move, swingy, and while it's fun for the first hour the remaining 1-2 hours can be really awful. I'd much rather sit down for a long game like Battlestar that's consistently fun -- and even fun to lose, which Talisman is not.

---

Between my second and third play, I revised my attitude towards Talisman and resolved to take it on its own terms: grab an adult beverage, expect a beer and pretzels game, laugh at your buddies (and yourself), and don't worry about winning. If by some chance I acquired enough stuff to go for the crown, I would; if not, I'd have fun doing whatever happened -- picking the thing that sounded most entertaining and just rolling with it.

And it worked! This turned Talisman into an enjoyable game for me. So much so that I re-rated it from a 3 to a 7. It's outside my wheelhouse in a lot of ways, and I don't think it'll ever be a go-to game, but taken as more of a fun ride than a game to devote much brainpower to, it's actually quite fun.

I. love. euro-games. Why then can't I play this game enough? What hold do you have over me Talisman? What dark secrets lend you your power?

In all seriousness, this game should not exist, and is basically mocking modern game design. Un-balanced starting players. A completely random, from super good cards, to completely deadly monsters in the adventure deck. Player elimination. ROLL AND MOVE. Super, super long, and it doesn't really scale well in terms of game length. More players increases the time length linearly. And yet it all works. To the game's credit, there are some fancy, behind-the-scenes game mechanics to keep it flowing smoothly, and make it fun. But at the end of the day, Talisman is just the Ameritrash-iest Ameritrash, and I can't play it enough. Bravo Talisman, bravo.

Very simple game, but one of my favorite boardagame.
We have one hero that it travels in regions to became more strong. 
When Your hero is enough strong then you open the portal and you will do tests to strong or craft.
When you finish tests, you arrive to Power'crown and with this you kill other player.

RATING: 5
A rich fantasy theme and familiar monopoly-style gameplay, but far too long-winded for after-dinner fare. Moreover, BG cogniscenti will scoff at the simplistic pre-euro roll'n'move luck-fest mechanics.  Best viewed as a gateway game for early teens (which was when I first played and enjoyed 2nd Ed back in the 80's!).

The publisher's abandonment of this game a scant few months after its release robs it of any hope of expansion, and thus improvement - which was the central appeal of earlier editions.  UPDATE: now acquired by FFG, there are no safer hands for it.

I simply had to buy this one. Latest version of the legendary game from my childhood. New wrapping of something more less the same that I played 10-15 years ago.

Pretty much everything ever said about Talisman is true.  It is a dumb, it is entirely luck driven, and it is really pretty bad.  

It also is really fun.  The last time I played it, I laughed so hard I seriously thought I was going to need to go to the hospital.  The game is timeless.

Was fun when I had no life in highschool but the very long games put me off to the point where we have only *joked* about playing a game of talisman for close to two decades.  I play Star Fleet Battles and Titan more often than I play this game.  Not bad as a source of ideas for your RPG campaign.

Played it with my Thursday group.  Doesn't bode well when the first time you play the game and ask about how to win the game, the response is "Oh, you get more powerful and then kill off the other characters,"  followed by, "we've never actually finished a game.  A lot, and I mean a lot of dice rolling, randomness and in general wandering around waiting for things to happen.  The characters seem to be a somewhat random "paste-on."  For instance, I started with a druid who by the end of the 2+ hours playing beat an ogre chieftan in hand-to-hand combat.  Oh well, probably not a game I'll request to play.

Feels like a very long game.  Reasonably repetitive gameplay, and the theme isn't particularly deep.  

The move and roll mechanic is a bit of a luck fest, and not in a good way.

However, watching your opponent get toaded while about to reach the  crown of command - now that is fun.  

Best when drinking.

This "game" isn't so much a time waster as it is a waste of time. 

The only decision one ever makes is to move left or right on one's turn. That's it. 

Talisman is uninspired and dull. It can last several excruciating hours. 

Unadulterated garbage.

RATING: 7
This game is a classic.  Very easy to learn, and fun to play.  Similar mechanic to Monopoly, as in a player rolls a die, and moves that many spaces.  The player either lands on a good space, or a bad space.

An average game will last about 2 hours, depending on how many players are playing.  There are a lot of cards to collect, such as items, and allies.  The game is very random, as it involves rolling dice to move (and just about everything else), and drawing of many, many random cards.

There are 14 characters to chose from, each with special abilities, which offer a nice variety.  In a sense, this game is like an RPG (role playing game), much like Descent: Journeys into the Dark.  Unlike Descent, Dungeon & Dragons, etc., you do not need an Overlord \ Dungeon Master to play.  This game can be played by two players, whom both control a hero each.  This makes Talisman a great 2 player game.

There are many items to collect, many monsters to slay, and many interesting places to see.  Due to it's randomness, each game session is very unpredictable.  

Each player tries to level up their character, and collect as many powerful items as possible, so that they can undertake the main challenge, and win the game.  While the game is designed to be competitive, it can also be played co-operatively, although, it probably won't be as fun.

While for the most part, most people will agree that Runebound 2nd ed. by Fantasy Flight Games, is better, and more complex, it does not take any fun away from Talisman.  Talisman allows players to interact with each other more so than Runebound.  A Runebound game also has the tendency to drag on, and last longer than it should.

With Fantasy Flight Games taking over Talisman, the game should only get better from this point on.  There will be new models released for all the characters, and new interesting expansions!

RATING: 5
The game is fun in the beginning, but for my taste it drags out too long with a rather weak endgame. Everybody is trying to buff up in the outer region, and after that it's into the middle and inner regions. Add to that the very high luck factor - everything is dependent on the right die roll and draw of the card. Not really my cup of tea, but my wife loves it. 
The components are beautiful, only the markers for life, strength and craft are almost illegible in most light conditions. Use wooden cubes or something else instead.

Quite fun.  My first play of this ran to four-ish hours with five players.  If this actually runs for 60 minutes once folks have got it down my rating may rise.

Haven't played since the second edition, but loved it when I played it.  Was the first RPG-style adventure boardgame I'd played.  Can be a bit random and your choices are limited when you move.  Not much of a story-based adventure, mostly wandering around building up your character in order to be the first to take on the Dragon and win.

RATING: 4
It's a push your luck and stab your buddies dice rolling game. I played it twice just to make sure of my impression, as the first group I played it with was risk averse and had no interest in winning, they just wanted to have all the best cards. There isn't much more skill in this game than Sorry!

For those who say it is like D&D, I wonder who the heck they were playing with. Yes, Gygax was involved in both, but these are totally different games. D&D is about working together to accomplish your goals, Talisman is a solitaire drag, where player interaction only occurs by chance (with a little choice), and only in an exploitative way. This describes the game in a nutshell: roll dice, flip cards, roll dice, pass dice, wait for everyone else to do the same, rinse, repeat. D&D should involve making decisions with the input of others, not just rolling dice all day with very little need of player interaction.

Ooh, I remember playing this a good while back - my parents bought it in a fit of nostalgia - and ye, I won't be playing this again. Pure drudgery, even they agreed after we all played it.

If you like rolling dice in a cliche fantasy setting - put on Lord of the Rings and watch that while you just mindlessly roll dice on the table - the story is better and you have about as much control over it as you do in this game. Then you can claim to be the hobbits and that you won, or that you had bad luck as Boromir.

It's Monopoly with dragons! Despite being a sucker for theme, the only way I actually have fun with Talisman is perusing the components. Draw characters, Prophetess wins, but to actually come to that result takes longer than filling tax forms. Unlike Monopoly, you can't even stop things after an hour and collect the cash. I doubt the fate tokens from the FFG edition really improve on that. Do they?

I played this a LOT in the mid-80ies, when I was at school. But let's face it, once you tear down the extremely well done Fantasy setting - there is not really much left: oh, it'smy turn - roll the die, decide whether to turn left or right - more often than not a decision between "draw one card" OR "draw one card" yawn - almost NO decisionmaking in this game and the beast just keeeeeeps draggggggin on - yawn

Not a FFG fan, but this was a nice revision.  Hate the money making model though, as it makes such a simple game so drastically expensive to get enough cards to approach the level of the old GW.  Also, the encounters less colorfully described, and the plastic is silly.  Still, the map is nice and large and the art is ok, but I miss the cartoon-y style.  The cones are nice, and a couple rules tweaks work well to keep the kid interested.

I just like the original 1975 Dungeon for this type of thing much better, or if I want a modern game, then Prophecy.  That being said, Talisman does have a fun, idiotic charm - and I find myself being drawn to it every now and then.

A comment about the inner region. I felt that the challenge from the werewolf is a little too weak and somehow geared towards strength instead of craft. A little unfair for magic casting characters. So heavy spell users will need to adopt a different strategy to winning the game.

This is a great board game version of Role Playing. If you want the theme of D&D without character generation or story telling and just the dice chucking of battle then this is your game. WARNING: Games can get unnecessarily long. The length is the ONLY reason this games gets a 6/10. The theme, mini sculpts, and overall gameplay are great but it seems like the game could be streamlined just a bit to make it a good quick game, oh well, just my ADD kicking in probably. 6/10 for length.

Usually I moan (it has been known) if a game is to simple. This, this is simple. I played Talisman, Legends of andor and Runebound because I wanted to thin out my comically large games collection. Talisman still has it's place on my hallowed shelves (sold the others) due to the fact it's a great adventure game. Yes it's simple and old school but it doesn't need to try to be clever. It's charm oozes out of it's dated, dice rolling, board hopping fun. Adventure games for me are just that, where tales in the pub are recalled about how Dave would of done it if you hadn't killed him to get that sword. Get the gang together and you will create lots of different tales about your time spent playing talisman. A classic.

In sheer terms of fantasy ADVENTURE, this is "the" gateway. Pick a chara, roll the die, go through the adventure deck: meet a witch, village fair, demons...and be turned into a frog! Simple stats, simple rules, very very fun for a casual audience. Its too long for what it is (house-rules help), but it's a keeper.

Same game, better components . . . but could have been much better components.  It seems every game these days has colorful bits of plastics to bolster appeal (even basic kids' card games have plastic minis now).  What couldn't this game get some as well.  It was a great game in its day, but that is not today.  Still good, but not the best out there.  For your money, there are better fantasy game. Not as nostalgic, but better none the less.

RATING: 6
'It plays like a story written by a six year old boy forced to churn out a four hundred page fantasy novel.'
- One of The Haters

'That's what makes it awesome.'
-One of the fans.

The ultimate edition of the ever popular Talisman, its family-friendly nature and no-brainer gameplay continue to earn its cult reputation into the 21st century.

Talisman is essentially a non-gamers' fantasy adventure game. Its NOT really strategic (although you will learn tricks for success), it IS chaotic as heck and CAN go on for literally hours, but there's plenty of daft fun and entertainment to be had if you take it the right way! 

Its clichéd fantasy theme cocktail and lasting variety makes up for its lame roll-and-move-and-roll gameplay. Its best used as a gamers party game- get some drinks and munch in, have a laugh and don't take it too seriously!

Its not the winning, but the long and chaotic journey that counts. Its about laughing when all your stuff is nicked by raiders and then you run into a Dragon (Strength 7). What happens then? Well you go to the tavern and get blind drunk in the corner, that's what!

The revised 4th edition is like the final draft, with beautiful board art, pimped up components (little talisman gold coins anyone?!), more balanced cards and characters and a swath of expansions to keep it from getting too old. The addition of Fate also adds a huge element of strategy. The only complaint I can really level at it is that the enhanced artwork makes the game feel a little too dry and serious for what it is.

Just remember not to bloat Talisman with too many expansions at once- the large box ones in particular will over complicate what was never meant to be a complicated game!

Lastly note that this game will NOT appeal to gamers who cannot immerse themselves into the theme of board games. Playing this game from a purely straight robotic point of view will feel lifeless and boring.

My friends still joke often about old games of Talisman  and I'm sure they will continue to do so for many years to come. Its not just a board game, its a magical quest adventure game, and its a good bit of fun from time to time.

Black Industries did not do a good job of this re-release. They did a straight re publishing while failing to take the opportunity to tweak some of the old imbalances of the past. The new art is poor at times, printed on poor-quality card and much of the design is shoddilly done (text size is way too small).

A great shame to have made sucha bad job of a great old game. Better off sticking to 2nd ed.

Update - Fantasy Flight have finally done Talisman proud with their version. It addresses all the problems that the BI version had and is a very nice production indeed.

Adventuring light RPGstyle game; endgame is to become strong enough to overcome trials via stat checks etc.  4th ed seems more polished than the 2nd/3rd ed, adds fate counters (allows reroll) and has a lot of expansions.  Has PVP though no elimination; being killed you make a new character.  Good scope for personalisation/customisation/house rules.

Feh. Some cute ideas, but there are such better fantasy experiences out there that I can't see devoting much time to this roll-and-move. I've enjoyed it the times I've played it, but it seems very samey due to the board layout.

RATING: 3
The multiple reprints and editions shouldn't fool you: Talisman is little more than a memento from an era when fantasy Candy Land was enough to find itself an unchallenged spot in the market. The ability to choose between going left or right is not really enough to keep me engaged; then the roll-and-move, random event cards and swingy characters/items basically feel like playing an RPG session run by a 5 year old GM with anger management issues. Some people might find it so random it's funny and perhaps this is intended as a lazy Sunday afternoon family game; but the swingy nature of the beast can make it quite unbearable for kids because higher player counts might cause a single game to last 3+ hours.

I haven't played any expansion, but it's worth noting that if you're not from the US, you might want to buy a bigger table before considering them.

I hated Talisman when I was a teen, but picked up the 4th edition as I knew my kids would love it. They do and we play it regularly; it has grown on me despite its obvious flaws and limitations. Fun game to play with non-gamers, kids and those who just dig the fantasy theme. Not to be played with people looking for depth and serious gameplay. It is quick enough (45-60 minutes) with 2, getting quite long once you get to 4+ players....

Gets credit for being one of the first games of it's type. I haven't even played Runebound or WOW the board game yet and I can already tell you after playing Talisman that they're both better. This game has too much luck, too much imbalance, too much solitaire (lack of interaction) and too slow of gameplay. The mechanics are clunky and the theme is underdeveloped. There are some nice things about the game but the elements that are good have already been improved upon by better games. Don't get this game except for nostalgia or a history lesson. It's overrated by today's standards and even the board gets too much from Monopoly.

This game did not live up to the hype for me, i only played it with 2 players so maybe that was the problem but it just seemed quite dull and very luck based and with very little strategy involved. Probably a good way to get your kids into slightly deeper board games as it does have some very light RPG elements in it which are probably the most fun bit about it. I wouldnt bother with it though unless you want a game that is quite light on any kind of strategy.

RATING: 5
If we're going to play an RPG-adventure game, I will pull this out. I've tried Runebound, Prophecy, and others and each of those games try (without succeeding, IMO) to bring strategy to what is already a chromed-out luckfest. 

Talisman keeps things simple. Roll the die, kill some stuff. There is some light strategy--when to move inward, when to attack other characters, where to go with which character--but by and large it's simple. Ideally, the players are almost playing simultaneously. We can fit a 4p game in 60 minutes. Also, it's so simple to teach to new players!

It's not a serious game (nor are any of the other more complex alternatives going to create an RPG experience without a DM and hours of time), but played with this mindset, I have a lot more fun. I have cried of laughter several times.

Mage Knight and Magic Realm are very well the nadir of RPG-adventure gaming, but I just don't have the time or mental energy to commit to them.

A long, long game with a simple roll-and-move mechanic.  I wouldn't put much stock on the mechanic if the game was short, unfortunately is much longer than hour and a half (that's my max time per game) and provides almost nil opportunity for any valid strategy or tactical thinking.  Yes, you could play it for the experience, or you could play in that time many shorter, better games that provide a wide variety of fun, social interaction. It is beautiful though.

Wonderful iOS adaptation of the newest edition of Talisman (Fantasy Flight, 4th Edition).

My rating rose a point after playing the revised 4th edition.  I still don't see a lot of replayability with this game, it's repetitious and that equals getting boring fast for me.

RATING: 8
I will admit a big portion of this high ranking is because of the many hours and days of fun I had with this game some 20 years ago. The new 4th edition is definitely an improvement mechanically, FFG have really improved the game. The game has features which many people hate - lots of randomness, possibility to lose everything you worked for, takes too long to play, and all sorts of other crazy stuff which is largely outside the player's control. However, I love it as anyone can win and be competitive. It's brutally cut-throat and confrontational, most of the luck can be mitigated, the game itself beats you up if you take too many risks, and you never really know what's going to happen next. Great for an epic adventure game with many twists and turns.

I played talisman as a kid and remember it much differently than I do now.

The game is definitely an entry level fantasy board game.  It leaves a TON to be desired and the balancing is pretty garbage.  Sometimes spells feel powerful, but most of the time you're sitting with a max spell hand and have no beneficial use for them.

I only come out of a bored daze when facing players who are super adversarial, but they can't really get much done if they don't roll the right number.  I've had two players just flipping back and forth around me because they were one or two numbers to high.  These sort of dice movement adventure games make no sense.

It's decent and pretty much anyone can play, but after a few runs you're good for a few years I think.

Hm, I'm not sure what to think about this production. It's one of the games that need to be, well, not necessarily "fixed", but at least completed by expansions (the thief character for example, who cannot use all his advantages in the base game, or the dwarf). Also I must say the wording of the rule book, at least in the German HDS/Pegasus edition is a bit of a  catastrophe, I seldomly read such unnecessarily complicated sentences, and the structure of the rule book could have been a lot better. It's got some 20 pages of rules, while 9-10 would have been possible as well without cutting any content.

I like the theme for this game but it is very luck dependant and long. To speed things along whenever someone lands on a space where you draw cards, we draw 1 more card than it calls for. This limits the number of turns you get without running into enemies to fight.

Beautiful game and excellent components! When we are in the mood to play Talisman we have a blast playing. The roll and move can get annoying for my wife. If there was some way to get around the need to roll an exact number to land on a spot...a variant or something...I know she would play this all the time. 

That being said however, this game is really awesome! The fun of roaming the board having any and all kinds of adventurers and the many many different characters you can choose to play make this game so much fun! The game is funny, (i.e. being turned into a toad for a few turns after an adventure turned bad). The character alignment is also a great feature (you can be good, evil or neutral).

The fact that all players are in a race to become strong enough to make the journey to the Crown of Command, takes this game to a whole new level. And then, once someone gets to the crown, everyone else on the board is hit with the Command spell that zaps the life out of them. If two or more characters find themselves at the Crown...they must battle to the death. Last man standing wins! The whole concept is pure genius and so much fun to play.

The 3rd edition of this game holds a special place in my heart for re-introducing me to the hobby during high school and I bought this version on the strength of that nostalgia. 
Now that I have developed my collection and tastes however I find the game far too random, far too long and far too inconsistent.
Play count is closer to 20 or 30.
No longer owned.

Played this with wife, son, and friends a few times.  Can be fun, but a whole lot of chaos in the form of randomness can make the game a frustrating experience at times.  Plays quickly and can provide a fun 1-2 hours (depending largely on how quick the players go) without being a "heavy" game.

I made it my goal to collect EVERYTHING official for Talisman when it was rereleased. So far, I'm liking the expansions, and they've done some interesting things with the mechanics, to expand upon the "roll 1d6, move, do what the space says" very basic mechanic of the game. Haven't gotten a chance to play it with some of the expansions in a while!

RATING: 9
  I like heavy eurogames. I like games which offer me many different strategies (Caylus being one of my favorites). So why the hell did I rate this game so high? 
   For almost 3 years I hunted for modern adventure board game to replace Talisman (2 ed.). There were great number of them, but none survived the test of time. Games like Runebound or Return of the Heroes seemed to promise more freedom to player and more choises. I was wrong. Sure, there were some interesting choises, but their core they were very random and had many flaws. Runebound had serious downtime problem, lack of interraction among players and very boring gameplay (kill - buy stuff - reperat 10 times or more). Return of the hereos in spite of nice flavour started to be repetitive very soon (every game I played had almost the same quests). Dungeoneer happened to be dependent on luck with card drawing. Only Prophecy seems to have really good mix of flavour, balance and strategic choises - but at cost of very long and tedious gameplay thanks to much to slow character progress. Maybe it is possible to reduce the time up to 1,5 hour? We`ll see. 
  So, the wheel of time circled to the starting point. Then I found Talisman 4th edition. Its graphic desing immidiately reminded me old favorite paintings by Larry Elmore from classic D&D rulebooks (mid 80`). I finely realised that adventere board game I want to play doesn`t need to be about a strategy but rather a flavour. This game should have little downtime, possible players interraction and offer suprises. It doesn`t need to be fair. It doesn`t need to be very strategic. But you should never be sure what is it going to happen. 
  And so it is Talisman 4th edition. I hate games which promise to be strategic but in fact are luck dependent. This game doesn`t promise that and never did. If you are looking for some serious strategy - this game disappoints you, i`m sure. But if you leave your adult disilusionment behind the door and open yourself for the sense of adventure you will probably find it. I found my board game adventure here, in the land of Talisman.

Edit: I lower my rate to 9. I did it because of lack of opportunity to play it as often as I would. But it`s still one of my favourites.

Edit: My eldest son became a fan so I gave his my copy :)

RATING: 10
Love this game.

I'm a competitive person. So I have to remind myself to not play Talisman competitively if I want to enjoy myself. It took me a a bit to come to terms that Talisman is more aptly thought of as social gaming. 

Play on 4th ed. is slightly different than 3rd ed.  Once you get to the Crown of Command, you are basically trying to take out all opponents through attrition rolls. And they're trying to get there also to eliminate you before that happens.  

In more then a few games, because of this, it has come down to the absolute wire. Which always is a great time!

*After probably 25-30 games, I have finally had the famous "game of Talisman that would just not end". I was well suited and prepped and shot into the Crown of Command. I should have been taking people out fairly quickly, but DAMMIT! A healer showed up in middle circle and a Mike had the Poltergeist. This enabled him to move one space- ramp up by killing a monster- I'd maybe cause one or two hits on him and he'd move right back to the healer using the poltergeist (one step per move). FINALLY he and the others ramped up their characters, came in the inner circle & I proceeded to finish them off. I hope something like that never happens again. We played with the Reaper- but the Reaper really didn't have much impact on play.

*If not playing with just 2-3 players, you'd best play "Sudden Death", where first person to get to Crown instantly wins. Also, start with extra strength or Magic and ramp up at 6 vs. 10. Even with that, a 5P game can be extremely long.

*******MY PREFERRED WAY OF PLAYING***************

I now like playing these variants to speed it up-

-Roll 2x D6 and choose one of them as your movement die (outer realm only).
-Start with extra life AND craft.
-Ramp up at 5 (or 4 even) points of strength and craft.
-Sudden death- first in to center wins.

Doing this usually makes games come in ~2hours

*Reaper expansion is now permanently mixed in. 

*Dungeon, Dragon, Blood Moon, Sacred Pool and Frostmarch expansions all contained in Dragon expansion box. Also have Harbinger and Cataclysm expansions in own boxes.

RATING: 9.25
Very fun fantasy adventure game with admittedly a lot of luck, but it's not totally devoid of strategy. Additional expansions tend to add more ways to get stronger and enter the Inner Region. The base game arguably has a greater luck factor than it does when expansions are included (particularly the board expansions). I feel like I can get really involved in my character in this game. The art is usually beautiful and the components are generally well crafted (although some of the miniatures look a tad wonky on occasion). This game is a behemoth in terms of playing space, though, especially so with extra expansion boards, so make sure you have a big table or at least a comfortable floor. All in all, I will always be willing to play a game of Talisman. Just know that I can be pretty merciless.

I play with the Reaper, Frostmarch, Sacred Pool, Dungeon, Highland, and City expansions, and I'm going to own the Nether Realm expansion soon. I played with the Dragon expansion, but I wasn't a fan of that because it added a lot of tedium to the game for very little added gameplay.

I liked the player interaction, leveling up, and quicker play vs standard fantasy games.  What I didn't like was the Monopoly feel to it, rolling many times to get to the spots you need.  The Sea Hag "ally" was way too overpowering and will destroy a player's game when she's drawn.

My board ripped after a couple years, but a little scotch tape fixes this right up.  If you have the expansions can get a little tedious with all the little rules and vast amount of adventure cards.

Just a great old game that continues to stick around and be a ton of fun.  Many complain that it's just roll and move with a theme but....that's the point.  If you have the correct mindset and get into the game it can be a ton of fun plus you have the character building side, screw your neighbor, combo's, etc.  There are many more mechanics to this game than appears at first glance.  If you enjoy long games that suck  you in, this is it.

I've enjoyed it since 2nd edition and it just get's better.

Looks like someone just made a copy of second edition, warts and all. Not much thought went into this edition as it includes all the original mistakes with out correction. On top of that the text is hard to read on the board & cards, the numbers on the plastic pieces are almost invisible from 1ft away and why cardboard cut-outs for playing pieces, Trust me 3rd edition is far better than this. I feel it is a missed opportunity.

liked this and played this way more than I ever thought I would ( I suppose we all like at least one game here on the geek that everyone else says you should hate and if you don't you're a bad bad person). The game is quite the story generator. Lots of ways to play. Tons of variants and fan content.

Some people like Tales of Arabian nights or Agents of Smersh. I prefer Talisman as my story game of choice.

Yes the game is luck heavy and old school Ameritrash, but manages to be fun and entertaining regardless. I find my self drawn to this game even over other games I think I should like more and are seemingly designed better. Despite it's flaws, if you like adventure, emergent narrative, and hijinks, Talisman just draws you back like no other game. The game has it's charms. 

That said I would never play Talisman without at least a couple of expansions. One of which would be the reaper.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Talisman gets a boost in my rating for the very fond memories I have of the old edition and the accompanying expansions. I've owned one complete set as have friends, and we always had a great time. Nowadays it feels like it can drag out into a 'slap down fest' depending on how the cards play out and the ending can seem a foregone conclusion even though there's a 'come from behind' factor. Maybe I'm getting too old to play a board game that takes 4+ hours?

I was fairly annoyed when FF released the Revised 4th Ed. a year after I got the 2007 4th Ed. so I ditched the Black Industries Ed. and recently bought a FF copy. The full sized expansion boxes are a bit daunting, but I'm hoping to get a few.

Hilarious and random at best, and sluggish and mind-numbing at worst, Talisman is a mixed bag of totally random events which creates some memorable game moments.  Takes longer to play than I would like, and leaves little in the way of player choices.  It basically boils down to choosing to move left or right and letting the cards determine your fate.  Still, I find it to be an acceptable entry-level board game.

RATING: 7.9
This is a neat game, standard RPG fare. My only complaint about it is that for the most part it feels very solitary type of game until the very end of the game where you are forced to interact with the other players. The reason for this is that given the choice, most players will opt out for dealing with monsters than with players, since they do get experience from the former, thus progressing in the game. I got the conversion kit to the new one (see my notes on that if you want to think how I felt about it) because I think this game really benefits from expansions. I also think this is one of those games that requires very little explanation or training, so it is a good fit for new players that are ready to put up with the length of the game (really easy to get into multi hour games, particularly with lots of players).

I think Fantasy Flight Games (having acquired the game and introducing the Revised edition) has done some work to make this game less frustratingly random. The basic game, which consist of some very small changes to the original 4th edition released by Black Isle (which itself is practically identical to the 2nd edition), is a step in the right direction but it still has a great deal of "role the die, see what happens, hope for the best."

That being said, it can still be fun. In general, when I play with friends that don't like complicated games, Talisman is usually palatable because it doesn't require a lot of mental investment. Unfortunately, that's the same thing that turns away more sophisticated players.

I've played this once with 4 other players who had a combined 1 play between them.  The game was fun but seemed to drag on a bit.  Player interatction was minimal.  I wouldn't mind playing again to see if it's more fun now that we know what we're supposed to be doing.  I don't ever want to play this with anyone who thinks about their turn before doing it -- this needs to be played bang-bang-bang fast.

I had fond childhood memories of this game and bought the fourth edition together with three expansions some time ago. What a disappointment it was. The game is very random, which at around 4 hours playing time leads to loads of frustration. First hour is quite fun, watching each other's misery after unlucky die throws and card draws, but after that the only thing I feel is desperate wish for the game to be over.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
A terrific adventuring game.

Doesn't provide many decisions during play (roll, move, read the board space and/or cards and follow the instructions). There is also a lot of luck involved and probably not a whole lot of skill. It can be a lengthy game, especially with many players.

However, none of that seems to matter as it's extremely enjoyable to play!

"Return of the Heroes" may be a slightly shorter & more interesting game to some, but the rules are more tangled with many exceptions to remember.

Components (Revised 4th Edition) are great, although I don't particularly care for minis in general as I'd rather not have to paint them to distinguish between all the grey figures on the board. Mine are now simply painted in a range of solid colours - and my preference would have been for them to come this way (different coloured plastic for each figure).

OWN: *REVISED* 4th Edition with some changes (figures, card revisions, etc.)

NOTE: ALSO OWN 2nd Ed... somewhere?

This being a nostalgic favorite, and one I enjoy playing with my son, I should probably rate it higher.  The new edition was good, but I am disappointed that they didn't clarify/streamline some of the rules a bit more (i.e. spell use).  Though I thought the old editions got carried away with the expansions, and the base game was better, at some point I will probably get the complete FF set.

RATING: 9
I’m a bit of a trashy gamer which is why Talisman is one of my favorites, despite its many problems. Very few games are able create an emergent story in the same way Talisman can. While unbalanced, I enjoy the large amount of playable characters since it makes every game feel different, even though you’re doing mostly the same things. Its heavy use of dice based mechanics comes off as dated as hell, although I don’t mind it, since I’m fine with playing around probabilities rather than absolutes (rolling to move is the exception here, and while there are ways to make it easier to get the number you want, it’s needlessly frustrating). I enjoy how the board is built up as the game moves forward, and the initial simplicity of the game and its mechanics makes it easy for non-gamers to understand before things get trickier late game. 

Although I really like this game, I have a lot of reservations as well. The game goes on for far too long, which isn’t a problem in and of itself, although the lack of complex mechanics can make it boring (corner board expansions go a long way to mitigate this, and I don’t recommend playing without The Dungeon at least). The characters are wildly unbalanced even in the base game, and I ended up removing half from the deck since my group consistently neglects them. Down time can be quite long with groups of 4 or more players, especially in the late game when players are developing more robust strategies to win.

Despite its many flaws, I keep coming back to Talisman since it offers a very specific, simplistic, and old-school style of fantasy adventure. Newer adventure games don’t really scratch that same itch for me. Definitely not for everyone, however.

(I definitely did not write all of this to justify giving this game a 9 haha what)

Roll dice and kill monsters. Kind of uninspiring mechanics, but good entertainment when you want to play something light while meeting your friends. Bit like DungeonQuest, but much more loose package. So kind of watered down experience, when compared to that. Has the feeling of much longer journey and importance though.

Talisman was my first board game (beyond Monopoly-type games). It has great sentimental value, but it hasn't aged well. We've tried a cooperative variant that gave it some more mileage, so maybe it will see some extra playtime.

One of my favorite games as a teen. I spent hundreds of dollars on the game and expansion while working a minimum wage job, and then lost it all in a pool bet. Now, I get very little enjoyment out of the game (although not because I lost the pool bet). Roll, move, fight, roll, move fight. People get very bored waiting for their turn.

RATING: 7
My experience with Talisman has been long and varied.  I got into the second edition back in the 80s.  Loved it, played it to death.  After hundreds of games I lost interest in the game for about a decade. 

Lo and behold, here comes the FFG version.  I had to give it a try if only for old times sake.  After on play I realized how much I missed Talisman.  It's such a great game and the FFG version is the best Talisman ever even without the expansions.

Talisman gets a lot of grief for being a roll and move game.  And on your turn that is basically what you do.  You roll the die and then have an encounter on the space you land on.  Encounters either hurt your or give you various kinds of upgrades.  Once a player is strong enough and has a Talisman they can attempt to cause the game end condition by moving through the "inner region" to the Crown of Command space.  The Crown of Command allows you to kill off the other players.  Last person standing wins.

My favorite things about Talisman are the die rolling, the variety of adventure and character cards.  Why is dice rolling so awesome in Talisman?  First of all it makes down time virtually nil.  You roll the die, move, have an encounter, next person's turn.  But there's more thematic reasons for the die roll.  Let's say you were in the city and wanted (or needed) to go to the Tavern.  If you roll a six for movement you can move straight to it.  Frankly, there are not a lot of individual spaces on the Talisman board and too much determinism would make the game linear and boring.  But because you have to roll the die the likely hood is that you will have to land on a few non-Tavern spaces prior to getting to the Tavern.  And these non-Tavern spaces will likely require yout to draw one of a vast number of adventure cards.  The adventure deck contains all sorts of things from powerful enemies to useful items to board-wide events.

Sure your journey from the City to the Tavern could be quick and uneventful, but that would make for a pretty boring adventure.  Instead the die rolls and Adventure cards provide many a twist and turn.

Embrace the Talismangler!  All the complaints about this being a random game with few choices are totally true.  However, every now and then it's good to have something like this.  You don't always want to THINK when you play.  Sometimes you just want to be taken along for the ride.  I know, I've dissed Talisman 3rd edition, but that was before I saw the light. Besides, for some reason, I like the 4th edition better than 3rd (which I've only played once).

I love Talisman, but never finish a game. I think it's because we keep playing with 5-6 players. I think I will make Talisman my favorite 3 player game. I have plenty of 2P only games, and most games cap at 4P. I'll reserve Talisman for when we only have 3!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A very easy, highly luck-based questing game with a vast array of character choices and a large number of different encounters. This game hit it off very well with a group of non-gamers, but its biggest downfall is a ridiculous game length. 

Even with the "rules for faster gameplay", it can take several hours to complete the game (depending on the number of players). Many games I've played have had to be ended prematurely by just declaring a winner because they were dragging on far too long. I certainly don't mind playing a long game, but only if its a game with meaningful strategic choices to be made throughout. 

As I explain to everyone when I teach them this game, "It's mostly a game where you just roll the die and see what happens."

RATING: 5
Please, know this game before you try to play it or teach it.  Recognize when a player has a combination of cards like a curse that will never let them do something fruitful before an hour or two goes by. Please, know who your opponents are so you can use the large amounts of downtime fruitfully to catch up, instead of dropping this four hour brick on two to four people who never played, and one who knew how to play it better than you, and nearly all of them strangers to you.  Please buy the excellent app and let it manage the game rules you do not know against A.I. opponents.

it's not an awful game if you play it with the right people, but it is a long slog of a game where you must eliminate all other players.  Make sure everyone knows it, make sure they are okay with that.  Grind your character into dominant positions by maximizing its stats.

NOSTALGIA BE DAMNED
After playing many grinding games of 2nd edition many years ago I thought I would give this another go with a fresh pair of eyes,  I wasn't disappointed.
The Fantasy Flight revised edition is the definitive version of Talisman. Its feels like a homage to 2nd edition but with some very subtle tweaks and balancing, not to mention the minor inclusion of fate tokens.  
Graphical enhancements and new components elevate this game even further. It looks fantastic.
The dice haters will still scoff at the old school roll and move mechanic but it works. A classic fantasy game with the licence now in the right hands, they have taken this game further than GW ever could.
UPDATE okay maybe some nostalgia was involved, its not the second edition Gary Chalk, which for me is  part of that the appeal of that edition. but its looks great.
The gameplay is good but the ending needs to be a bit more dynamic than just reach the x spot.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The base game is nearly identical to the 2nd edition I played in my youth.  What makes 4th edition different is its wide variety of expansions.  With a few of those, you can make some fun changes to the game each time you play.

After so many years I still kind of enjoy this game. Yes, it's overly simple, yes, luck plays MAJOR factor, but is this game about winning anyway? Definatelly not for me. I rate it 5 for the base game w/o any  expansions.

Simple yet fun little trip to the realm of fantasy heroes. Half of a thumb up. Have to be in the right mood! (Still, there are many better games in the same vein out there.)

Update: Okay, it was nostalgia.

Game relies too much on luck for my taste. Time and agin ― e.g. every time you want to ascent to the next level ― you have to roll the exact value to get you onto the one field that allows you to progress through the game. This can take hours, and is very frustrating.

Worst game I have ever played.  I was expecting to be able to have some decision making power in the game, but was completely wrong.  This is basically monopoly without trading and re-themed.  It would be enjoyable if playable in under 30 minutes, but my 5 player game literally took 4.5 hours and we still were not done.  If you are a serious tabletop gamer, stay away at all costs.  I was bored about 1.5 hours in after I had realized I was not going to be able to choose anything I did for the rest of the game.  It really ruined our game day.

I. Despise. Talisman. Okay, okay... maybe despise is too strong a word. I dislike Talisman, a great deal. Adventure games for me have always been a little hit and miss, but an adventure game this based on luck and with heroes as asymmetrically unbalanced as these... I just can't. As the kids say: I literally can't even. Every time I play this I either want to gouge my eyes out from boredom or I am cursing the dice gods for my abhorrent luck as I watch the other players punch each other in the dick over the crown of command and slowly kill me while I fumble around outside trying to do something, [i]anything[/i] of interest or value. Even being on the other end, psychically killing my friends isn't interesting because sometimes there is [i]absolutely nothing they can do about it[/i] and that's just bad design.

Black industries version: This game is entertaining.  Not a lot of thought of decision making.  Heavy luck of the dice and card draw.  Game also can get lengthy especially when getting stuck on die rolls but good game if not taken too seriously.   Edit:  have now played with FFG upgrade kit.  The fate token idea although subtle adds so much to the fun value of this game.  This small skew of luck really adds a more quickness and to the point feeling of the game.  Reduced the game play about a half an hour.  This game is still what it it..an experience rather than a strategy game but now it more entertaining since the dice are a bit reduced.

=====================================================

I"m leaning towards casual, thematic games these days. Talisman certainly fits the bill. Sure, it's a bit long, and luck-driven. But the interplay of encounters, board situation, and items generates a fun story. Variety is essential, so I'm glad I picked up an expansion (Reaper). It's a good choice for a Saturday night when you want to enjoy a few beer and not take anything too seriously.

I guess we'll see, until expansions it will sit on the shelf most likely.

Very nice, immersing game.
Easy to play and easy to teach to newbies.
Enough randomness to avoid "chess mentality" calculation.
But, when one has played it a number of times, there are strategical and tactical choices that usually make the difference between winning and losing the game.
In addition, as expressed in the first line, one is really led to feel that he is living an adventure - without all the organizational clutter of an RPG.
There is player interaction too: a lot of fun jumping upon an opponent to steal his talisman (if you are a thief) or rip it from him (by means of direct combat).
All in all, a pleasing, easy and fun game.

If you like a (heroic) fantasy setting then Talisman will not disappoint. The strength of Talisman is its (very nice looking) board with all its possibilities that change with time. Many of the adventure cards are also 'Place (location)' cards that stay at specific locations generating a new board within the board (excellent drawing in the cards by the way). I believe that's the reason that the game creator(s) made a large board. You certainly need a big table to play the game and even larger if you plan to use one of the big expansions.

I also do not share some criticisms from other players concerning too much randomness in Talisman. For instance after a dice rolling for motion you have the choice to either go left or right on the board, therefore mitigating the consequences of a bad roll.
Furthermore, the 'fate' tokens can be useful in this regard and can help the characters devise a strategy in their explorations towards specific locations in the board.

 Expansions also look promising to create a more immersive atmosphere. Not a perfect game by all means but it does its job.

This isn't really a game so much as an activity. 
Pros
This is a fun and entertaining activity, if not much of a game. The board is beautiful and I've painted the figures quite nicely.

Cons
The only choices that the players make are whether to move clockwise or counterclockwise and when to move between the regions of the board. Everything else is determine by a dice roll. Having so much determined by luck isn't necessarily a bad thing so long as there is also an element of strategy that is under the control of the players. In Talisman, however, the players are only along for the ride. Now, if someone figures out how to add some euro elements to the game that would be very interesting indeed. 

Addendum: We've started adding house rules to reduce the luck slightly and speed up the game; e.g., we allow players a choice for movement: stay put, move one space or roll the die.

Nostalgia makes this game shine for me.  It is a playable D&D stand-in (playable in the sense that adults with responsibilities, families, jobs, etc. can get together with a few friends and knock off a session of Talisman in a few hours).  Beautiful artwork, design one has come to expect from fantasy stalwart FFG, and thoughtful tweaks to the overall design make improvements to an otherwise imperfect yet enjoyable dungeon crawler.

I understand the "it's just roll & move" complaint--I do--I just disagree.  It ain't chess.  It's a theme showcase, and oozes with atmosphere.  I sometimes wish there was a bit more to the primary mechanic than 1D6, but yet still always want to play and always enjoy myself--even if ribbitting around the board for a few turns.

The Fate tokens are an interesting addition--but (as has often been the case with FFG games) they put 98% of the design skill into the game itself, and 2% into storing this monster.  High-quality bits, artwork, and overall quality still shine, though; with the anticipated several expansions this will become a game that does not travel well and will become more and more "stores in one box" prohibitive.

No, there isn't much game there. But after so many very complex fantasy games, there's a sense of clear-headed enjoyment to just rolling and moving. Talisman is the sort of game that everyone should play when they are young, before we become too old to just have fun. The lack of control results in an adventure game that actually feels adventurous.

The game can take a little long, but I like that you have to decide when you want to try to win. It forces you to go for the kill, and a lot of games are satisfied to just let you go through the motions. That sense of proactive-ness is one thing I love about Talisman.

*edit* After four games of this, I kind of love Talisman. I'm bumping up my rating to a 10, simply because the prospect of getting to play genuinely excites me. I finished a two-hour game last night with three expansions, and I already want to go again.

This is one of my first 'heavier' type of board games that I have owned. Choose a fantasy character to run around the world and battle many evils while on the quest to be the first to gain the Crown of Command! 

This is just a game that I would not play anymore given the choice. That being said, the biggest reason for this is because there are and I own games that fill the same kind of theme and niche, but are just infinitely more fun.

I played the Talisman for some times and I quite enjoyed it as a good game for three players. I had a really bad experience when playing it with five other people. I was really bored waiting for my turn and nothing exciting wasn't happening for a few hours of playing. I'd surely play this for 6 players again, but I'd have to gather really good players who know how to get into game's atmosphere.
Anyway, it is a very good fantasy adventure game. I'm waiting to see the expansions re-edited, too.

RATING: 6
This game fills my need to play a fantasy RPG, but usually takes longer to play than the game merits. Arriving at the Crown of Command should simply win you the game, instead of waiting an additional 15-45 minutes to kill off all remaining players. Also, the game has several game breaking / winning cards that can act like cheats (i.e. turn into a frog; despite being negative, the hag lets you go where you want; the monk; the prophetess).

Yet, I always find myself coming back due to the potential of the game. I love the adventure cards and the first half of the game. Once your in the middle realm or inner realm, one character tends to be overpowered.

A true classic. Inspires greed, backstabbing and a LOT of random, insane chaos. Even impromptu roleplaying with the right gaming buddies. I miss Gary Chalk's old illustrations and find the new board a bit... empty, but on the other hand now there's room for cards and gaming pieces.

Random, but it works. I feel like the expansions give more choice and open up places to go on the board. The different characters are all cool, some are better than others, but it is a lot of fun to try different ones. The game has a push your luck element. Are you strong enough to go for the crown or do you want to kill just a few more creatures to up your strength, get some gold to buy a flail, pick up a few more spells. Or will you get turned to a toad and lose it all. Great game, but still too long.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Ranked high for nostalgia reasons, so YMMV. W/O nostalgia, it would be a 5 for me. 

My houserules (of course! it's Talisman!): 

1. always allow a character to choose between moving 1 (walking), and rolling the die (taking a caravan). 

2. always allow a character to spend gold to add to movement, 1 for 1. 

3. Stat scores max out at 12 (followers, objects can raise stats above 12 while held).

4. Five stat worth of defeated creatures traded in for a Character stat point (not Seven, as in RAW)

5. Talismans can be spent as fate.

6. dice can 'critical hit' - meaning that for characters and creatures, a roll of 6 in combat means roll again and add it to the total (ad infinitum)

7. If you lose a gold but don't have any, lose a life instead.

8. you can quest for a stat, a gold, or to change alignment, as well as for a talisman. You must complete a quest to begin another.

Nice dice and coins in this edition, slightly pointlessly bigger board (the inner region is especially a waste of space - the obvious place to dump your adventure card stack, suspiciously large enough to fit a whole extra board...).

I much prefer the old Gary Chalk and John Blanche art, but the new stuff is nicely done (notably inferior to Runebound artwork).

Nothing done to address the old balance issues to prevent the game becoming 'Gnomequest'. Only innovation being allowed to collect Craft points -  which now creates a new balance issue of craft being too easy to boost.

FFG's tweaks seem to be a bit more thought through, and now there is a hope of decent expansions, maybe some life will be breathed into this fondly remembered game.

Cutthroat fantasy adventure game with mechanics as easy as those in a pacifier:  Roll, move and do whatever the space in which you landed has told you to. It has made me remember why I do gaming in the first place:  the fun and the laughts about someone misery or luck.  A very enjoyable experience.  Nevertheless, it is not a game for everyone, because some may think that there aren't whorty strategical decisions or find it too luck dependant.  I'd like to play the [i]Assassin[/i] with the second edition rules, since now he seems overpowered.

Nope, it's not any more fun now than it was twenty years ago, quite the opposite really. I know that the game is not to be taken seriously, and all the fun resides in backstabbing friends and rejoicing in their demise but - even with the help of a substantial amount of beer and white wine - the game is just shallow, repetitive and just plain tedious after the first couple hours of wandering aimlessly around the board.
Maybe we're really lousy players, but the game just takes forever to complete and we were all very grateful when one of us finally landed on the crown of command, even with 5XP advancement and sudden death.
Besides, the game is awfully expensive. 60€ down the drain...

Yes, it's very random, but still a wonderful adventure game. Almost no downtime and nice flair, easy to get into. The huge variety of characters and the randomness of the card drawing increase it's replayability.

I like the PVP and social aspects of it most, but many get turned off exactly by that. Maybe the best beer&pretzel game existing. Also great for playing with the entire family.

[2 plays] I had no experience with any of the previous editions, so I was pleasantly surprised to find myself enjoying what is basically a roll and move fantasy themed game. I put myself back into the best parts of a 7th grade D&D session and had a great time. The components and artwork are top notch and have a nostalgic feel. 

I think this game could easily go on far longer than it would remain welcome if players take a long time to make decisions and play too conservatively, but that wasn't a problem in our game. As it stands, I see this in the category of a "once per year thematic experience game."

First play Cabin.con 2011 with Garrett, Michael, and Corey. Most recent play Oct. '16.

I think the reason I didn't take shine to this is that I play a lot of RPG video games where I can choose my own "build". Playing Talisman felt like I needed to roll with whatever I got in order to succeed which went against the grain. But the variety of effects produced by the locations and the way players had to choose between them was very interesting.

Far too light for my wife and my own tastes. I really wanted to like this game, hearing about it from others and the cool cover art.

This probably isn't the game for you if you want a game which requires high amounts of skill and strategy to achieve victory!

RATING: 5
Overall, I'm never influenced much by the way a game looks, so all the glitz won't gain any points with me. I find this edition of an old standby over 20 years to be perfectly playable. But (without a labored list of details), its mechanics lean a little more random than in the 2nd edition, which I still consider to be superior. I'm also one who doesn't care how long a game takes so long as the journey along the way is great. Endings don't matter much compared to that, and the push in the current edition toward making the game play faster and faster isn't a plus to me. In fact it is pushed so hard that some routes for winning are more and more shortcutting the need to find the games namesake and core fixture... a Talisman.  So my rating is basically that the base game alone is average, solid, and sound as an addition to any fantasy gamer's bookshelf... and even that of mainstream gamers who ordinarily don't have fantasy as their main diet. You will want some of the expansions eventually or the game becomes tedious when played too often.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Talisman is one of those games I would love to love. The theme is great, the art is great... but there it stops.

The worst about it is that it's too random. Far too random. It plays like a complicated mix between snakes-and-ladders and ludo. Secondly, the bits are fiddly and easy to loose, and the numbers on the little plastic tokens are almost impossible to read. And the game takes so incredibly long to play and it takes far too much space on the table. 

So, while I might play this if someone REAAAAALLY wanted to... I probably won't ever play it again. The miniatures might be used for other purposes though.

Fun adventure game but seems like a volatile experience that you have little control over -- if cards and dice rolls don't  come out in a fun way you are in for a long slog.

Endearing, but can't help but shake the feeling that, as a light game in a heavy package, this game is outshined by other offerings such as Key to the Kingdom on the lighter end of the spectrum, another oldschool American game that provides similar feel and story but escapes the long-haul slog, or modern adventure titles like Merchants & Marauders on the heavier end, which provide a similar sense of adventure and story while giving you real decisions to make at the same time.

My favourite adventure game ever. There's plenty of randomness, that's for sure, but it also means there is a sense of discovery and unknown whenever the die is rolled or a card is flipped.

If you're looking for an adventure game with a bit of retro flavour, Talisman is THE adventure game you want to try.

This is just a prettied-up roll-and-move game.  You roll a die, move around a board and collect items to fight monsters in pursuit of fulfilling a quest, or quests.

If I were going to play a roll-and-move game it'd be this one.  The adventure components make it a little more entertaining than your average Milton Bradley affair.  It will get annoying though when you find yourself in need of landing on a space just to finish the game and just can't roll the right number.

Talisman won't appeal to seasoned gamers; the roll and move mechanic may frustrate them quickly, and for good reason. It's more of a generically themed family game (provided the family is kind of geeky), and if you take it as such, it's enjoyable despite its poor design. There are little decisions to be made throughout as you build your character and push your luck. It's easy to learn and play, the art is well done, and it won't ask too much of your brain at the end of a hard day. Highly recommend the rules variant included with the game that shortens playing time.

With so many fantasy genre games in my collection, my group prefers and more-so enjoys, Relic. 

However, this game with all its randomness and expansions could create some hilarious happenings. Such as drawing the "Werewolf" event card and having the card affect my Mule. We still laugh about that to this day.

I shouldn't like this game as much as I do. It's really quite a bad, antiquated design, but there's just something compelling about it. Every time I see it at a friend's house, I ask to play it, despite the fact that afterwards I'm usually left with an empty feeling. Still, I certainly play it enough to warrant at least a 6.

This is like Snakes and Ladders with a Games Workshop twist.  How this game has become so popular and been around for sol long is absolutely beyond me.  The game can drag on for hours with nothing but roll and move actions.  It is mind-numbingly awful.

I used to play the older ed. of this game so I pretty much knew what it was all about. Still it's a great game and my 8 year old son picked it up straight away. In true GW style the difference between being on top or on the bottom is just a dice roll or adventure card away, which means it's a great game for different age groups as it gives everyone a chance of winning.

As for the update I love it, the parts are robust and well made. I painted the tops of my counters white to pick out the numbers and it is a neat little improvement.

I knew this game was bad before playing it.
I had read the reviews and knew about the roll-and-move mechanic and all the randomness.
Unfortunately one of my friends bought it despite my warnings and we ended up playing it. A disaster...
It was even worse than i had imagined. Can't believe anyone can actually enjoy a game like that. It's as satysfying as playing monopoly (but it has a better theme)
Did i mention it is TOTALY random?
There is only one deck of events where all good and bad events are mixed...One can draw a perfect item while another can draw the worst curse; totally unfun. 
Not even a second set of events (advanced or tougher events) for the middle region...
Very bad overall :(

Found the random movement system (by dice) to be extremely frustrating.  In addition, the characters are unbalanced.  A player with a stronger character can continually force players with weaker characters to start over, because there is a lack of catch-up mechanism.  On a positive note, the combat system is simple, somewhat involved, but did not create much downtime.   The components are of excellent quality.

I'll confess, I would love to get back into RPGs, although unfortunately having a "life" makes it virtually impossible. I cut my gaming teeth on D&D like so many others, and while it would be pretty low on my list of RPG choices nowadays, I still have fond memories. Talisman manages to embody both the best (the thrill of beating a monster, the excitement of nabbing some cool loot) and the worst (that crazy backstabber just stole my gold!) of the experience. Overall, this was a blast to play!

Play again? You bet! We had to call the game off after about 90 minutes because of other commitments, and I could tell we'd barely scratched the surface, so this is a game that you would want to start only if you knew you had four or five uninterrupted hours available; and I could tell that the game would probably become repetitive if you found yourself stuck on the first "level" for too long. But it was a real blast of nostalgia, so I can see doing it again with the right set of people. I had played Descent at Origins 2009, and honestly I would pick Talisman over Descent any day.

One play only - I like it BUT i dislike the small Strength, Craft and Lives tokens, they are very hard to read and distinguish apart. Also i swear the card text gets smaller each edition (or is it just my aging eyes...) Anyhows it is Talisman and i know that will be enough - until expansions, (which i won't miss out on this time) come along.

I know a lot of people who like Talisman, but I can't understand why. To me, you only got one choice in Talisman, and that is in which direction to move on your turn. Everything else is random and/or deterministic. Really, really, frustratingly bad.

Entra in un mondo fantastico di draghi e magia! In Talisman ti avventurerai in una cerca perigliosa, alla ricerca della leggendaria Corona del Comando. Potrai scegliere tra il guerriero, il prete, il mago o uno degli altri undici eroi dotati di poteri magici e abilità fisiche.
Ma il cammino che porta alla corona è rischioso. La leggenda narra che solo un favoloso Talismano possa proteggerti nelle lande che si trovano oltre il Portale del Potere. Inoltre, trovare un tale artefatto è un compito tutt’altro che semplice: mostri, trappole e oscura magia ti attendono in ogni turno di gioco. Quindi, affidati al tuo coraggio! Ne avrai bisogno per superare i tuoi avversari, per assicurarti la corona e forgiare il tuo destino!

Here's my biggest beef with Talisman. You can play it and have an '9' experience. Or you can play it and have a '2' experience. I thoroughly believe all experiences in between are equally possible.

(I'm absolutely convinced that neither a '10' nor a '1' is possible.)

I don't mind at all that the game is unashamedly (nay, quite proudly) lucky. 

I do mind that the game has just as much chance of being I-hope-it-never-ends fun as it has of being kill-me-now unfun.

This is a great game with lots of replay-ability as different cards come up each game. The negative aspect of this game is your character may get beat down randomly or even die, leaving the player that found only good stuff to cruise to the finish line, or even worse everyone gets the beat down and the game ends up taking 3+hrs or more when everyone eventually just wants to quit the game. The expansions add even more characters and cards, some of which make the game harder and/or longer depending on which 'ending' is selected.

[Children's Game] It's a roll and move game with random encounter cards and equipment and levelling up. No tactics, no strategy, nothing to get in the way of an essential epic fantasy adventure. Whether you want that or not, Talisman is what it is: a well executed classic. Pure, simple, and easy. 

I really enjoy the first half of the game, but then it overstays its welcome when you get to the designed-for-frustration central ring. When the game transitions you from flipping cool and fun adventure cards, to literally just rolling dice over and over to see if you can hit a high target roll, it sort of stops being fun. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Talisman is a classic for low-thought fun with of exploration and adventure. Don't look for strategy here; there's very little.
While the FFG version has made some good improvements (fate) and some great component upgrades (minis and plastic tokens, yay!), its still got a lot of flaws and confusing problems - some of which are almost 30 years old. Better in most ways than the original, thought its really silly that we have to use some of the same house rules we used to.

Ok, you can probably find this in the FAQ, but just to point out, craft/strength VALUE means the number printed on the card. We would never have gotten this without BGG: its poorly explained and completely counter-intuitive. (Base craft? Starting craft? Lots of better ways to say this).

The board is AWFUL. Seriously. Who in the world decided we needed a board twice the size of an average table with room for 20 people standing in each space?

This is a solid 8 for me, maybe a 9 if it plays well with 2.  Super simple game, yet lots of fun.  I love the PvP aspect.  This is just a blast.  If you play it quickly you can finish a 4-player game in 2 hours.  Endless variety and tons of good times.

**********EDIT************

I had this at an 8 and then I played it again.  It's a 10 for sure.  I can't imagine not wanting to play it.  It's really just a perfect game for what I want.

A decent update of the original game, which includes a few welcome improvements such as the fate feature. Very high production values (which is what you'd expect from this publisher) although I do personally prefer the artwork from the original, which had a lot of charm. The end of the game when the character at the crown of command is casting the command spell to win the game can often feel anti-climatic.

This is the most stupid game ever.

But for some reason it works. The experience of sitting back and watching your story unfold as you make sensible decisions only to have fate sucker punch you and then kick you once you're down. And then kick you again. Brilliant.

It also has that certain something where it's just 'broken' enough that you constantly want to house rule everything. Sure you'll probably make it worse but there's something charming about being able to do that.

Seriously considering buying this, though I don't think anyone will ever want to play it.

Roll a die, move that many spaces, encounter whatever is on the space you land on or draw adventure cards, level up your character and work your way towards the middle of the board. Pretty simple concept. It's very random, but strategy is possible.

I've played this a few times now and it is just a terrible, terrible game. 

You spend three hours or so grinding out enough life, and skill points to be able to luck your way through the inner 2 rings. Unlucky rolling and you'll never get to a point where you can make it across (if you're going for craft) or if you do and you roll 'badly', you can end up being thrown all the way back to the beginning.

The only interesting aspect is when you time your dash to the inner rings (assuming you can roll the correct number to land where you need to), but even this is negated by the luck of the dice.

Just a terrible game that should be allowed to die quietly in the corner. I pity any new gamers that are introduced via this; they'd never come back.

Truly one of the funnest games I've ever played straight out of the box! Very little house rule adjustments to play this game and have a fantastic time with it!

Each session typically lasts 4-6 hours using stock rules, but if you use all the official alternative rules for speeding the game up, then typical games last 2-4 hours.

RATING: 6.5
I recently found an old adventure game called Key to the Kingdom from an op shop. After perusing the rules, I mentally marked it off as a brainless roll-and-move adventure game with cool bits. Then one day, my son (aged 4) pointed it out in the game closet and wanted to give it a go. So we did with my daughter Jojo (aged 6) and to my surprise, we had a great time rolling dice and laughing at the random encounters. It was then when I decided that if we're going to play roll-and-move adventure games with cool bits, we might as well play one of the best ones out there, namely Talisman.

Story-telling is a must. Part of the fun was dramatically revealing encounters as they turn up and figuring out how events came about. Rather than just draw an Adventure Card to reveal a Witch and roll the die to determine what happens, Evan walked his dwarf through the path in the Woods till he came to the strange throne carved out from a tree-trunk (as depicted on the board). After sitting down on it to rest, an ugly Witch came out the trees screeching that it was her chair. However, after seeing how strong the Dwarf was, the Witch decides to give him a gift instead.

It was difficult to explain what 'Neutral' meant. The kids understood Good and Bad (Evil), but Neutral was a new concept to them. Simply saying that Neutral means 'sometimes Good and sometimes Evil' didn't help. On hindsight, perhaps demonstrating via an imaginary scale where Good is on one end, and Evil is on the other and Neutral is right in the middle might have been a better idea. Anyway, Evan was disturbed by the fact that his Dwarf was Neutral, so in the end we made his Dwarf a Good Dwarf by giving him the Good Alignment card.

The kids were surprisingly very co-operative to each other. When Jojo pulled out a new Spell card (Acquisition) that allowed her to steal an item from Evan, she expressed that she didn't want to hurt Evan; she wanted to help him. So I allowed her to ditch that Spell to draw another one. And there was a time when Evan found the Unicorn, and said that he'll pass it to his sister when they next meet because she loves Unicorns. As a parent, I'm happy that they're demonstrating brother-sister care for each other. As a gamer...? Ah well, I'm sure some cut-throat-ness will turn up in time

I was on and off the fence about this game and it´s earlier editions (which I never played) for quite a while. But when I saw this game in Essen 2007, I was really taken with the quality of the components (I love the coins!) and as my girlfriend was also interested, I bought a copy.Our first two plays with two players were very good. There really is even less strategy involved than in Runebound but it also plays much faster. Even though there is little depth in this game, it is great fun and has relativley simple rules. Of course it is a dicefest to the extreme but I am quite fond of these. Compared to other RPG-Boardgames, it is definitly much weaker than Arkham Horror (because AH is less random, offers more choices and has even deeper theme but also takes much longer) and it is on about the same level as Runebound. While Runebound has more depth, more decisions and more detail it also has even less player interaction and especialy takes much longer. So it is a bit a question of mood. I guess with more than three players, Talisman always wins against Runebound as I *assume* that Talisman should be great and simple fun while I *know* that Runebound drags on forever with more than three players.

After so many years... a good return. Talisman reminds me of great sport champions that make a comeback after many years. A lot of press coverage and hype, but time is not kind with anyone, so people must realize that an athlete that used to be the best a couple of years before, now is just an "old glory". Sure, graphic is renewed and nice, the box has a great layout but the game... I loved it, 20 years ago. Now it's just slow and quite boring

One of my favorite games from the 80s when I was in high school.   We would play this as a filler game in between D&D nights.    But always fun even in its raw form.

This version I can't really comment on how it stands up to the original as a good 25 years stands in between the last time I played it. :)

It plays well and reminds me very much of the fun I had in the past.   Sad though my 10 and 11 year old daughters do not share my love for this style game and refuse to play it.   Luckily my wife will play it with me!

I started playing Talisman back when I was about 10 years old (first edition). It's a fun little game, easy to understand and get non-board gamers into a fantasy world. I don't play this game with my more meta-strategy oriented friends as they find the luck to be too big of a factor in this game. Fantastic for casual play though, and I've gotten many non board gaming people into board games via Talisman. One of the main issues I have with the game is that it takes a very long time to complete, usually 3-4 hours when you have 5-6 players.
I've only ever once tried it with 8 players, never again.

Bought for nostalgic reasons, as I loved playing this with my friends back in the 80s! The revised 3rd edition is a faithful update of the original, with a few (good) tweaks. A fun "beer and chips evening" game, or younger players as an gateway to fantasy board games.

Black Industries Edition with revised 4th edition upgrade pack, which makes it fully compatible with revised 4th edition expansions. Some of the old components have been discarded, since the upgrade pack makes them unnecessary. Split corners of the top of the box have been repaired with transparent tape. Missing one die, one red gem, one green gem and one blue gem (which makes no difference in gameplay).

Nice remaster of the original. Component lighter than the GW editions that preceded it, this is much closer to the original card version. 

This is a nice pick up and play dungeon crawl. It doesn't require a whole lot of record keeping or development like games such as Heroquest or Descent. 

A great game. I spent a lot of time as a toad!

It's dumb, but it's fun.  It probably shouldn't be fun -- it's long, dated, slow, and really has no player agency -- but I can't deny the fun when one player was laughing so hard he was crying after turning another adventurer into a toad, and I had my arms in the air while loudly cheering as I attained victory.  It has a certain something...

Very simple but fast paced boardgame themed in a fantasy setting.

Can only be taken light-heartedly as it is a bit of a dice fest and relies heavily on luck, but thats where its charms lie.

Occasionally outstays it welcome when a game lasts a little too long, but doesn't detract too much from this classic old school Roll & Move.

RATING: 2
Blurgh.... Just... don't. There are so many other better dungeon crawls sims, play one of them instead. The RNG factor in the game is savage, chances of the winner becoming obvious in distant advance are high, playing it out becomes humiliating... You can perma-die early on, then sit there bored for 3 hours while your friends finish. There's a lot of cool stuff in this game, it just comes together really, really poorly with it's worst flaws. Find something, anything else.

A lot more "tested" (and fixed) than prior editions, and with the extra cards from the other expansions this is a fun exploration type game. Just note that some of the new cards artwork are not up to the original standard of Gary Chalk; the game can be fustrating with respect to accumulating enough craft or strength due to its random nature.

This is a bit of a change of pace for me, as I really haven't played a game that relies almost exclusively on dice rolls.  But I'd be lying if I said I didn't have fun with this game.  It's strength is in its charm, whether it be from the adventure cards, the spell cards, or just the locales on the game board itself.  Yes, it's extremely luck driven and it follows the inherently dull "move around, roll dice and watch stuff happen to you" mechanic, but when I feel like board gaming for the sake of board gaming, Talisman just feels right.

My big complaint about this game is that it feels too slow to play.  You just want to level up (as it's a race to the centre) but it's mainly dice rolling and seeing what happens.  It doesn't feel like you can play smartly, you're either lucky or your not and when you're not, it's pretty boring.  It's easily possible to go an hour without feeling like you're getting anywhere.
We lost interest in this as the pace was slow, and when you're not growing in power it's boring, also when someone starts to get lucky and move ahead there's not much you can do about it.  It's tough to catch them up when just relying mainly on luck too.

Belíssimo jogo: componentes de alta qualidade, tabuleiro bem desenhado, tema atraente, porém, a alta dependência do fator sorte (movimentação e batalhas – rolagem de dados) e a duração prolongada de uma partida, faz com que logo após as primeiras partidas, este jogo se torne frustrante e tedioso. Acredito que seja uma excelente escolha para apresentar aos potenciais jogadores o mundo dos boards, contudo não acredito que o verei muito mais vezes numa mesa.

Talisman is a tricky one. It's so easy to fall into the trap of "Oh, I'll just keep building and building up my character for hours until I feel strong enough to take on even the middle zone". If you have a table full of players THAT will be a drag. 

If, however, you end up with a game like the last one we played, where 4 motivated players all went for the crown like the devil goes after the poor man's soul, and you end up with all(!) 4 players in the final zone at the same time, 3 of them even at the crown together for a while.. THEN you experience sheer awesomeness.

My best description of this game would be a combination of Monopoly and Munchkin. It is a game of dice-rolling chance to move your player around the board, but you get to gather weapons, magic items and spells to help you. You have to fight monsters and try to beat your opponents to the middle of the board. However, the middle of the board is where the worst dangers are, so don't go there until you are ready. I have the unrevised 4th Edition, which is not compatible with any expansions from any of the other versions. I was easily able to make minor modifications to the cards and board to "update" the game to the Revised 4th Edition. I just used a different game's parts for the Fate tokens. You can get a list of the changes online.

I played Tales of the Arabian Nights a week prior to my first play of Talisman. Tales puts a lot of people off because there is little choice for the player. For me, Talisman is very similar, only with less of a story. 

Movement is via the roll of the die (although you do have a choice of clockwise or anti-clockwise). Much of the outcome is determined by a roll of the die, in the form of "roll the die to see what you find", "roll the die to see what you stole" or "roll the die to see if your armour protected you". With Tales, you get to pick from a number of choices (hide, fight, trick, etc). It may end up being just as random, but I find players feel a bit more involved in what is happening.  

At this point, I prefer Tales. It had people laughing more and they seemed to enjoy it more, if only for the novelty. Talisman is not bad. It even strikes a nostalgic chord, reminding me of games I played in my youth, but that's also the problem. It feels like something I've played before, played a lot, and outgrown.

Very fun to play, although it's very random with only a base game. Expansions are must have to truly enjoy this game. With them, talisman changes from a boring monopoly-like game to a risk management with some strategy in it.

Good, simple, old-fashioned FUN.

Great for 2 players. Plays quicker than Runebound, is far less repetitive and has much better artwork. Much more player interaction (aka doing mean things to eachother) however we have so far ignored these bits! This game feels more like an adventure because the dice rolling doesn't overpower the story like it does in Runebound.

I've been doing pen&paper RPG for half my life, and sort of got bored with regular board games a long time ago.

An excellent game, but the core 4th edition didn't have enough adventure cards causing me to mark it down.  Once you add Reaper or one of the other small boxes, the game improves dramatically (unless you're a Euro gamer that likes to have the same five cards predictably show up every game . . .)

[Note: Own the digital version]
I normally love Fantasy Flight, but this game has Games Workshops dirty grubby hands all over it and you can just feel that they want to milk this for every last penny.  While playable in its default state and mildly enjoyable, it already has too many booster packs.

This is a $60 game!
With a dozen expansions!

If you wanted this game right now, with every expansion and every extra character, it would cost you $415! for 1 core game, 10 large expansions, and 2 small expansions.
Know how much that would have cost me in HeroScape figures?!  $250.  Maybe that's just inflation, but endlessly more figures?  A hard plastic grid-locking map?  High quality cards that feel laminated even though they aren't?  I feel that's a better use of money if we're charging these prices.

But hey it's games workshop, what was I expecting, NOT to pay $20 for a single miniature?

Played with no PvP, it's a light fantasy romp with racing/push-your-luck elements. We used several recommendations to reduce die-roll-screwage and shorten game time. Sudden death ending; roll 2d6 and pick one for movement; cheaper strength/craft upgrades.

Fun game, but why did Fantasy Flight decide to make the board so darn big.  Part of the appeal of the game, at least for me was that it didn't take up a lot of table space.  Not true with this version,  although it does look good with all the bits.  It was always meant as a beer and pretzel fantasy board game.  Many have been critical of it, but is was never meant to be so deep.  Those wanting something with more meat and substance should look elseware, maybe try Descent 2nd edition insted.

Definitely a dated game.  Roll and Move can be very frustrating when all you want to do is stop on one spot.  I really get a kick out of the exploration aspect though, I love just flipping a card and seeing what I run into, finding gear, leveling up.  This is like starter RPG for kids in that regard.  The part that sort of killed the game for me is the central area where the game drives into a rather dull traffic jam.  Especially when you FINALLY get to the top, and all you're doing is rolling a die on your turn and hoping that you can slowly kill every other player.

I bet the game is more fun when multiple people reach the center ring at once, but while that would offer more tension, I feel like it would also make the game last longer than it should.

Picked this game up at a discount because Borders (RIP) bookstore has gone out of business.  Anyways the game was a surprise hit for myself and my girlfriend, not so much for the gaming group.  That might change with a few more plays or maybe the addition or "The Reaper" expansion.  Our first try with the group lasted 4+ hours, and when the game states a 2 hour play time that's a bit extreme so thank you FF for understating play time yet again.  That aside though I like it so far and will be buying at least the "Reaper" expansion for it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
(One play) This game is extremely random and there is a lack of control in your actions and decision making, due to the roll and move and random cards. It feels like the game is playing you, and any decisions you make are usually arbitrary or obvious. Losing turns can be boring, and I can imagine turning into a toad to be extremely frustrating as it is very punishing (it didn't happen to me).

Luckily, the theme is very strong and I love fantasy. It did feel like an adventure, so I did have fun. I also won by kicking the troll's butt 10 times in a row with my monk, so that was awesome. I might play it again very occasionally.

If you're not a fantasy fan, avoid this game like the plague, as there is little else you'll find here.

Update: If you want a game that's random, play Tales of the Arabian Nights - it's infinitely more fun and entertaining.

RATING: 9
So much has been said of Talisman. Yes it is highly luck based. Yes it can stretch on for eons. Yes the board takes up exactly one square mile of table space. However, each expansion you add reduces luck factor and adds meaningful decisions and strategies. A few house rules greatly speed up the game and reduce frustrations. And... well nothing can be done about the gigantic boards.
Talisman itself is a pretty good game, but I'd have to admit expansions improve it quite a bit. It almost a labor of love because my god will you have cards to shuffle. You will spend hours thinking about how to delicately house rule a few things without changing the spirit of the game. But when everything comes together it really is a magical experience. AND it's the only game I can get my wife and casual game friends to play that smells vaguely D&D-ish.
This game is stronger in theme than anything I've played and writes a story of adventure each time. Count yourself lucky to play it or own it, because Fantasy Flight Games no longer publishes it due to Games Workshop withdrawing its license :(

A very good reprint of a classic game. Like many, I cut my teeth on the GW version and played this a lot when I was younger. Sure, the game is roll and move and the winner of the game is the one who gets the luckiest, but it is still fun if taken in light doses.

I liken it to gambling more than anything. You might spin the wheel and get the Runesword on your first turn - or you might draw a craft 12 demon that blasts you off the map. If you go into this one with the right mentality, you will have a good time.

This is the game that started my love affair with "modern" board games back in the early nineties. 

Straight off the bat I was gripped with the mixed range of characters and their specific traits, how they bended the game for each player.

The levelling and development of the characters in order to attack the central goal, the crown, is a strategic evaluation / guessing game!

Then add on top of this a wealth of opponents, lovely artwork, items and events - not to mention the additional boards and expansion packs and you might get an idea why this is one of my favourite things

Nowadays, the game isn't as well regarded (my wife cannot see the merit involved) but due to my sentiment it will always remain golden.

I played this at a demo during Gencon UK 07 and was hoping that the 4th Edition was an improvement on 3rd (Which is the best version). I won't be trading my 3rd edition in for the 4th as it seems to have taken a step in the wrong direction. The playing figures have been replaced with cards which fall out of their holders when moving, the plastic counters are difficult to read probably better to have left them blank and used them as counters)and cheap. The ending for the game goes on longer than a Peter Jackson Hobbit Epic. The demo took 4.5 hours to play with the ending switched to the lenient fast play rules. I would suggest anyone wanting a copy of Talisman get the 3rd Edition.

Played this for the first time in a long time. Played with five players. One of us did not like the game and that affected the experience a bit but I really enjoyed this game. Every card is a surprise, every diceroll is a surprise. Even though luck (or fate) plays a big part it did not affect gameplay for me at all. Can take hours to complete. But hours well spent. The artwork and components are amazing. Love the board. 7.5 for me!

UPDATE: Ruined by the expansions. Sadly, the expansions and game are merged into the main box so - if I wanted it again - I'd need to sell the boxes and buy a new copy. It doesn't get played enough to make that worthwhile.

Probably the most silly, brainless fun you can have with a board. It perfectly achieves what it tries to do.

It's tense, gripping, and recreates the experience of watching a too-bad-its-hilarious 1980s fantasy film.

It's hard to describe the play experience, but do try it. You might like it.

This game basically comes down to simple die rolls and luck of the draw whichever cards you happen to get, and then fighting with everybody else over things nobody has any control over. You can spend hours building your character then meet something that can simple remove all everybody's fate tokens, even if you didn't draw it, or are force to point some item or spell at someone and, because you dared to point it at the obvious leader with a vast pile of STUFF, they turn around and obliterate all your progress easily. 

My friend put it as such: "It's too much like real life", and really, I'm inclined to agree. The game will slowly spoonfeed you upgrades and life and strength and such only to pull it out from under you whenever it feels like it. Unless you happen to be lucky enough to be a character with a completely broken skill and can get so much stuff you can't manage it any more.

If you have a good group then you may be able to get laughs out of each others misfortune and make light of the situations, but if you have such a group there are much better games you could be playing.

I have two friends who want us to play this occasionally for nostalgia purposes. I think their nostalgia is where this ought to stay.

This was the first proper board game in my LIFE. As a child I have played it to death. And though now it seems so luck dependent (you may never land on a space you need or draw monsters so you can level up your character) and playtime is sooo long and set up is sooo long, it still has a special place in my heart and will stay there FOREVER.

RATING: 5
Eh.  Roll-and-move with a neat theme is STILL roll-and-move.  That other aspects of the game are determined by the roll of the dice is frustrating, and no amount of special cards and characteristics isn't going to alleviate the result of a crappy roll.  If it didn't last 2-3 hours, I might enjoy it more, but as it is, it's too random, and lasts too long.

More than anything, Talisman reminded me to be apprehensive of hype and always play a game at least once before deciding whether or not to buy it. Basically, this is a fantasy-themed variant of monopoly with a few twists. Almost everything is random, which is something I can live with IF the game is fun and creates tension. Unfortunately, the game is boring, frustrating and takes forever to play. TRY BEFORE YOU BUY.

This score is higher than it probably should.. but this is a sort of "guilty pleasure" game and an old classic. Yes, it's flawed, especially compared to more modern titles.. the downtimes are terrible, interaction minimal, basically anyone can play solo, and with many people it becomes a drag. It's also dependant on luck and dice rolls (although some strategic planning can be involved). Still - it's simple, works surprisingly great as a tablet game for travel (I think it gave this game a new life, actually), and the fun of choosing and developing your character (albeit in too random way), using its powers, collecting items is still there. It's just a mindless, fun, adventure game with really easy, clear rules. Lower the score if you never played it as a kid and already played some more advanced titles, though.

RATING: 6
I like Talisman as a semi-mindless casual game. There are enough decisions and interaction that it doesn't feel like Candyland, while in the meantime you have a nicely thematic set of cards to play with. The primary downside to the game is that it's very imbalanced (lol Assassin. lol Ghoul), but this is fixed just by giving two character cards to every player, or by taking out all of the OP cards and having a "gimp game."

The games can sometimes drag on too long, so make sure you allow people to concede when it's pretty clear who the winner will be.

RATING: 6
I shied away from Talisman for a long time because everything I had heard about it seemed bad. Roll and move, monopoly board, completely random, too long, etc. I enjoy adventure games, but hate role-playing proper, so instead, I sought out games like Runebound and Descent to get my adventuring fix. At some point, I decided to give Talisman a try simply because the arguments between its supporters and detractors intrigued me. How can a game that is so obviously bad, have so much love directed toward it?

I came away from my plays with a couple of thoughts. First of all, I'll talk about the randomness. Yes, it is almost completely random from start to finish. You roll dice to randomly determine where you can go, you draw a random card to see what happens when you get there and finally you roll a die to see if you succeed or fail. That does indeed sound terrible, but can you look at a game like Runebound and honestly say that it does it any better?

In Runebound you roll a handful of dice and move by spending dice that show symbols that match the terrain hexes on the board. You are rolling dice to randomly determine where you can move. That's not different, it is actually performing the exact same function but adding in unnecessary complication. After you get where you are going, you draw a random card and do what it says. Sometimes you roll a die to see what happens to you. It's exactly the same, right?

Combat in Talisman is a single die roll. Runebound forces a few die rolls (still using randomness to completely determine the results of combat) to resolve its combat. Is this actually better? I don't think so...

My point is that the supposed "more strategic" gameplay of Runebound is an illusion. Talisman provides the exact same decision points and delivers them in far easier and more intuitive fashion. For that reason alone, I think Talisman might just be a better game despite its old-school design philosophy and dated engine.

No matter how many people complain about the cliche typical fantasy theme being boring, I STILL LOVE IT. And that was the draw to this game. I was new to gaming, and the theme was something I was ready to dive into. The theme is a bit thin, but still there enough to have fun with. The game play though, is painful. Way way too random for my taste, and for something that is as random as this it takes way too big of a time investment.

I quite dislike this game. It feels like the game auto-plays itself for about 40% already. You roll a die, see when you move. Roll a die to see if you beat a creature. Draw a random card to see if you get to beat up a chump, get beaten up yourself by a dragon or encounter a special location.

I have to admit, I like the idea behind the Encounter deck, where shops can pop-up potentially anywhere or that you can encounter monsters. 

But I severly dislike fighting monsters. It feels incredibly uninspired (1d6 + some bonuses vs 1d6 + some bonuses) and dull. And as you seem to be doing quite some fighting to power up your character, it feels like a grind. A multiplayer grindfest I might add!

I wouldn't have minded it so much if the game would take about 30m or so. But it can take up hours! Multiple hours of just hoping to have more good rolls getting more usefull encounters than your opponents.

It's a shame though as I can see potential in a game like this. But the implementation of the 'Talisman idea' in the actual game feels lacking to me.

I used to really like this, but recently I really can't bring myself to suggest it over the other games we have. 

I mean, it's fun to play with the right people, but I found that there's always other games that I'd rather ask after (like Lords of Waterdeep).

Essentially, I like the events and the idea that you have to climb your way up to the goal in the middle of the board, but if you're unlucky you can find yourself being a wall flower while the other players have fun simply because you keep getting stuff that does't help you progress. 

If there was a similar game where you get tons of event cards and dragons to slay but the things that you do had more bearing on how much you level up, I think it would become my favourite game ever but as it is sometimes it's really frustrating and it doesn't necessarily feel like I could have done anything to get a much better result.

I enjoy this game quite a bit.

I have a soft spot for cooperative games (which this is not), but I like a decent amount of randomness (luck) too.  And, boy, is there a ton of luck.  It also helps that this is my friend's favorite game.

I also love having character advancement that is in here and a great fantasy theme (love fantasy).

What I dislike is the player vs player conflict.  My game tastes lean towards Ameritrash (luck, theme), but not this element of Ameritrash.  I like the player vs player interaction to be somewhat light.  I don't especially love attacking others or being attacked, but it is important to the game as some characters and items are based on it.

The 4th edition game is gorgeous! I love the new cards. It's funny too, because while looking at the art on BGG I really missed the 2nd ed. art I grew up with, but not any more.

I bought this not only for nostalgic reasons, but primarily for a relaxing fantasy romp without a lot of heavy thinking. My daughters (4 and 9) loved it!

Regarding FFG version:

Crud! I had no idea how much cooler the game would be with minis, but I love them! The new larger character cards are also great.

My nitpicks are, first, that FFG only gave you 30 gold coins compared to the 60 from BI - plus the latter are inked! I am glad I could swap the 30 FFG gold coins for the 60 inked gold coins from the BI version though. Secondly, that the cards are now even smaller and the art is too good to be cropped so much.

Fate definitely improves the game IMO. I have a lot of fun with it, and feel like it balances out some of the characters.

This is my 4-year old daughters favorite game. (Edit: This same daughter is now 9, and still loves Talisman.)

If you're looking for a game that's got a lot of decision points, Talisman probably isn't the game you're looking for. However, if you're looking for something that's easy to teach and fun, Talisman's right down your alley. :)

Talisman is a fun game of randomness. It's easy to get upset with the game or other players while playing. Luck is a huge factor in the game, it can hose you for awhile or it can give you a major head start on the other players. 

Each of the expansions add so much to the game with all the new spells, adventure cards and characters to play as. 

This makes an excellent game to sit around and BS while laughing at someone elses misfortune or even get upset and seek revenge on another player. Sometimes other players will need to be put in check because that was your Rune Sword they took and now its Arse Smacking Time.

After playing this game a few times to adequately assess this rating, my enjoyment was much lower than I initially expected.  Each session was either way too long or too short and worst of all, it is entirely random.  No need to strategize whatsoever as card draws and dice rolls determine everything!  Pitiful is a very good word for a game that seemed to have much more potential.

I didn't play the game with a large group, but quite honestly, I would fear that it would drag on even further and quite possibly receive an even lower rating from me.

Fantasy Flight Games did a great job with the production quality, as expected, but the game falls too flat on all other accounts.

I find it comparable in strategy and complexity to Monopoly... maybe even The Game of Life.

I enjoy it for nostalgia's sake.  Suffers from really bad runaway-leaderitis.

Got this because I figured it would be simple enough for my 7-year-old son to play with me and mommy if we basically just read the encounters for him. It was alright, way too long to hold his attention (or mine for that case) but I could see myself pulling this out as a light beer and pretzels game.

A wonderful new version of Talisman. Not the same nostalgical feel as the 1st/2nd edition, as the illustrations are not the same, otherwise exactly the same game. Good cards, rather nice materials (though there is no need to have numbers on the counters, just use all the counters as a "1"), very nice board. Feels modern while the old version keeps its weird flavour. Same rating, though.

Caveat: "For what it is"

Perfect game to play with my girlfriend.

Fourth edition of the old fantasy themed roll and move game. You are a hero who tries to get to the middle of the map to claim the crown of command.
You could die on your first turn by finding the mightiest enemy in the game or still be at 0 experience points 60 minutes into the game because you haven't found a single enemy. Everything in this game is based on pure luck and you have two choices per turn - at most!

Great if you meet it with a open mind. I never played the older versions, and love this edition. Its fast, fun and has charme! :o)Hoping for expansions.

Too heavily luck-based for me.  Like the art and variety of monsters/cards, but about as much skill required as Sorry.  Also, Assassin card way overpowered.

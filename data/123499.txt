This game was a pleasant addition to our collection. The artwork is wonderful, and it is an enjoyable Euro to play that offers more stuff to do than the typical worker-placement-and-add-resources games out there. My wife is a big fan of it, which is a huge plus for it. I'm itching to break this out with 3 or 4 players.

Wow, where to start?  This is a very, very interesting game.  Every time we play it, my head hurts give the number of choices each turn presents.  This game requires a lot of planning, forethought and strategy.  It also requires flexibility and an ability to adapt. You may be going along just fine, when another player's unexpected choice throws your strategy into turmoil!

One of the beauties of this game is that it does not rely on any one mechanic, or even a simple combination of two.  There's probably five mechanics at play here, including resource management and placement, bidding/auctioning, deck building, and more.

Another beauty is the art: it's fun, colorful, attractive and flat-out unique.  I don't recall another game where toad people face hog men in such style (well, anywhere actually).

We thoroughly enjoyed playing the game and enjoyed the atmosphere it created.  While it's social, the real action takes place in your head.  This cerebral nature makes it fun to play regardless of the outcome.  Regardless of victory points, everyone wins.

I love this game. It has the trifecta. Beautiful art and components, a theme, and interesting mechanics that line up with the theme. City of Iron is a Red Raven production by Ryan Lauket, designer of the eight minute empire games. In the game you play the role of one of four young kingdoms with atypical races (hog men, lizard inventors, white haired elf like people and humans) trying to expand their influence. You do so by gaining market share in various goods, expanding into new lands, conquering neighboring smaller towns and assimilating them into your empire, and building up your cities. You can't do it all well so you draft a deck of military and civilian cards into your empire that contains the cards that better focus your strategy. The only draw back to the epic steampunk civ builder is that it can suck in Ap prone players and sometimes run longer than 2 hours.

RATING: 6
Fun game all-in-all, but it's very prone to Analysis Paralysis because there is a phase during the game where you may buy a card from a deck of cards. Can drag on for new players who have to read every card in the deck to find out which they want to buy during that phase.

+ Great theme and artwork; Given lots of choices about how to best utilize your resources.
- Can be difficult to branch out from national preset strengths.


Why it's previously-owned:
The game just didn't click for me.  I could see how it was good, I really enjoyed the theme/artwork, but there is no way I'd choose to play it over some of the other games I own.  
I traded this for Ghost Stories and Ninjato.

I finally got to play this at SaltCon. City of Iron is possibly the most beautiful game I've played. The artwork is highly evocative and original, a welcome relief from van-art fantasy and Tolkien clones. The gameplay in combination with the art design is likewise highly refreshing and immersive --  collecting lush new lands and quirky new citizens makes it feel like you're actually building a steampunk empire for (say) your Toad creatures instead of just pushing cubes around. (The artwork for each different clan contains  distinct images -- over 80 pieces of art in total!) A labor of love and really fun to play -- it's a winner. Huge congratulations to Ryan Laukat here. Can't wait to play again!

Eurogame με fantasy theme. Κάθε παίκτης παίρνει μια από τις 4 φυλές του παιχνιδιού και προσπαθεί να φτιάξει πόλεις, εργοστάσια και φυτείες ενώ παράλληλα ανακαλύπτει νέα εδάφη για να έχει χώρο να τοποθετήσει τα πράματα του. Στο παιχνίδι υπάρχουν δέκα διαφορετικά προϊόντα και στο τέλος όποιος παράγει τα περισσότερα σε κάθε είδος σκοράρεις τα αντίστοιχα VP.

Το παιχνίδι έχει λίγο από όλα μέσα. Πλειστηριασμό για το turn order, ανοιχτό drafting για τις κάρτες κτηρίων, deck building, area majority σκοράρισμα, hand management (καθώς κάθε κάρτα χρησιμοποιείτε με διάφορους τρόπους), και φυσικά σχετικά διαφορετικές ιδιότητες για τον κάθε παίκτη ανάλογα με την φυλή που διάλεξε. Πάντως το τελικό αποτέλεσμα είναι πιο απλό από ότι περίμενα.

Οπότε με τα χρήματα που έχουμε αγοράζουμε τα κτήρια και τις φυτείες που θέλουμε ώστε να έχουμε παραγωγή προϊόντων που ουσιαστικά λειτουργούν σαν μετοχές. Μας δίνουν λίγα χρήματα κάθε γύρα σαν μέρισμα και στο τέλος του παιχνιδιού δίνουν VP στους 2 μεγαλομετόχους. Το θέμα είναι πως κάθε φυτεία θέλει συγκεκριμένο τύπο εδάφους οπότε αργά ή γρήγορα θα αναγκαστούμε να ανακαλύψουμε νέα εδάφη.

Εδώ μπαίνει το deck-building κομμάτι του παιχνιδιού καθώς σιγά-σιγά αγοράζουμε κάρτες με οχήματα, πλοία, επιστήμονες, εξερευνητές, στρατιώτες, ρομπότ και ότι άλλο μπορείς να φανταστείς με τις οποίες κάρτες γίνεται και η εξερεύνηση. Ο στρατός χρησιμοποιείτε και για να κάνεις επιθέσεις τόσο σε neutral locations όσο και σε αυτά των αντιπάλων. Άλλωστε γιατί να πληρώνεις για νέα εργοστάσια όταν μπορείς να πάς να πάρεις αυτά των αντιπάλων?? 

Πολύ ωραίο το artwork αλλά δεν εντυπωσιάστηκα από το επίπεδο της παραγωγής. Φαίνεται ότι είναι το πρώτο παιχνίδι της εταιρίας. Κάποια πράγματα θα μπορούσαν να γίνουν καλύτερα, μου άφησε την εντύπωση πως ήθελε λίγες βδομάδες ακόμα για developing. Eπίσης δεν ξέρω αν τα 2 μονοπάτια (οικονομική ανάπτυξη, στρατιωτική ανάπτυξη) είναι ισοδύναμα.

Ενδιαφέρον παιχνίδι. Έχει κάποια θεματάκια αλλά πρέπει να ομολογήσω πως ο Ryan Laukat, designer, artist και producer του παιχνιδιού(!) δείχνει να έχει φρέσκες ιδέες. Περιμένω να δοκιμάσω και άλλα παιχνίδια από αυτόν.

RATING: 7
City of Iron is a nice game with some interesting and innovating mechanics, but it feels a little bit unpolished. The rules are simple and straightforward and the game mechanisms are easy to follow and implement. The game has depth but the cards are quite imbalanced, especially the military ones. I would play the game again and even though I am not a fan, it's a good game with a fresh vision.

RATING: 5
While beautiful to look at and with some stellar mechanics, I have been completely underwhelmed by this game during my admittedly limited plays. It doesn't feel balanced and when my opponent exploited this during our game it kind of ruined the experience for me. I'll have to try it some more with different gamers.

We are finding Mr. Lauket's games to be very hit or miss with us. We love Above & Below as well as Artifacts,Inc. But The Ancient World bombed for us and City of Iron falls into that category as well. The components are good and the art is gorgeous. But the mechanics are fiddly and there seem to be too many of them. On top of that some rules are not explained well or implied without being stated. It seems one of the failings of this designer's games. We invariably find some rule in the game that is overlooked and could be crucial. But in his defense he is designing, doing all the graphic design & art as well as publishing the game. So he can be given a pass for something slipping by every now and then.

RATING: 7
Ryan taught us the game at GenCon 2013.

Love the artwork in this game.  It really has a great ambiance/feeling to it.

Not so much a "deckbuilding" game, but more of a drafting game where you get to use your cards that you drafted. You have a set of unique cards that you can select from (no, you don't get to pick 5 chapels).   This is to me, a big, big, plus as you just start with 2 cards and aren't shuffling through useless money/points.  

Most cards have a unique action and there are meaningful tactical decisions that have to be made during the game with the cards in your hand and it often provides a difficult choice.

Caveat #1
Because ties are friendly, it seemed like there was very little incentive to go up higher since you would get both the income and the victory points (during the scoring phase).  There obviously was the "extra victory point" bonus taht you get when you reached "X" level, but it seemed minor compared to trying to diversify goods.  Unless you clearly thought there was another player to take down 2 points (for the ore for example), you would be better off expanding into salt or another resource so that your net points go up.  

Perhaps it is a problem only with 4 players (which is how many we played) and there is more jockey-ing when it is 2-3 players.  

Caveat #1.5  I'm curious to see how the game scales between 2-4 players.  You get 3 actions per turn, but you clear 4 building cards per turn regardless of the number of players and there was no condition to remove town pieces for fewer than 4.  I wonder how the game play changes given that you would then have a higher ratio of actions per A/B/C age. 

Caveat #2 - I only have one play in my belt, but I'm curious to see how "scripted" the game becomes.  The various town cards that come in obviously provide variability, but I can see how there could be set builds that are "right" similar to how Puerto Rico plays.  

I'll definitely need to give it another shot to see how my caveats look like after multiple plays.

RATING: N/A
Partially deck building from a preset pile of cards depending on which "race" you play. With the added issue of never shuffling the deck you've built.
Also has majority scoring based on something like area control, and possible player interaction if a player wants to steal territory from another.

(With Experts and Engines Expansion)

This game is set in an extremely thematic and unique steampunk world. A very clever game using the deck-building mechanic. The art is beautiful. Only negative is that the game drags on just a little too long in this first edition. Heard they fixed it with a turn limit in the new edition. The expansion offers even more options and provides more thematic material.

I'm usually not a fan of card drafting mechanics, but the turn order auction makes it more tolerable.  I liked the deck building.  Artwork is great. 

Update:  Does anyone bid more than 0-2 for turn order?  The range of options seems far wider than necessary.  Usually I prefer more options in a game, but I'm not convinced it's needed here.

When I was first offered to play this game at the Dice Tower Con, I thought I wouldn't enjoy it. I'm usually a Trader in the Mediterranean type of gamer and by the looks of the game, I thought the decisions and gameplay wouldn't be to my appeal; but I'm glad I got to try it as I would have missed out on a very nice experience.

First of all, not that I'm one to usually rave about this, but the artwork is fantastic. It pulls you right into the game and gives it a certain feel and thematic touch that somehow gives the game character. It seems that every card, whether a building, town or deck card was carefully thought out and planned. Kudos!

The gameplay is tight and tense in that you have just three actions a round to implement your strategies; that being buying buildings, attacking towns, or denying/acquiring something quicker than your opponent which all lead to getting goods/points. 

There is a quasi-deckbuilding element to the game and the decisions as to what to put into your deck are intricate and engaging. Do you go for the military strategy? Do you go for money and science? Do you go for building cheaper? Your deck dictates your path!

I don't know if after getting experience with the game there are scripted strategies or if it's a game of chess. I need to play more to see if it has staying power, but for now, I'm having fun!

Ryan Laukat is the designer, artist and publisher! Jeez!!!

City of Iron is the usual brain burning crap most point salad euros revel in turning into: it’s a spreadsheet in disguise, with just too much to keep into account and no fun at all.
After all, you didn’t join the game to have fun but to win, haven’t you?

There’s just too much in the game: you have to secure a stable source of currency and points (the only thing that matters in this dry waste of time), which means you have to put a foot into, possibly, every good you can. And to do it you only have to buy buildings, paying for them from the ones available on the board.
The downside is, you only have as many spots in your city you can build on: hence, you also need to expand and either conquer new cities and towns or upgrade the ones you already own, though you have to buy and then draw the necessary cards first. 
So a new obstacle is put into effect and so on, layer after layer of more things to do just because.

Oh, and you also need science tokens, that are granted by buildings and cards: you didn’t provide for a source of science tokens? Your bad, you had to think ahead and now it’s only fitting that you lag behind and try to make up for your childish mistake: there’s no room here for players who don’t carefully plan their next ten turns in advance.

There’s nothing to keep you awake - let alone excited - in City of Iron: since everything gives you points, it’s just a slogging exercise in the inane attempt at building an engine that nibbles a handful of points here and there, which hopefully will give you a slight advantage on your opponents, who similarly were busy doing the same over the whole game.

After my first play of this, I HATED it!
After I thought about it for a few months, tempered my expectations, and finally played it again, I REALLY like it.

My original complaint was that it was all "mechanics for the sake of mechanics". But now I don't feel that way at all. Now, my ONLY complaint is that it runs long.

 I'm not sure what to say about it. It's a good game. There is a lot of space to explore. The goal of the game is to have the most in as many different categories as possible. You get more by buying or attacking cards that you place in your tableau. However, there is limited space in your tableau, so you need to explore to open up more slots and more different types of terrain (resource cards are limited to different types of terrain). At the same time, you need to figure out how to get cash to pay for all of this. Lastly, there is a deckbuilding element where you can add character cards that you slowly cycle through to do more stuff. It's a little fiddly but not terribly so and the graphics are great. However, for some reason, it just didn't grab me. Will happily play again, but don't need to own.

Another pleasant surprise. I like that its basic mechanics resemble a fairly typical Euro, but it's not as punishing, and is a bit more confrontational, compared to many Euros. 

Of course, the real innovation here, and the best part of the game, is the deckbuilding, which really makes this game unique and highly replayable. Choosing which cards to take each round puts you in the tricky position of juggling short-term goals and long-term strategy. Some cards that might help you right away will clog up your deck later on, and vice versa if you are planning too far in advance. The variability here is enormous, and I can only imagine more so with the forthcoming expansion.

I just don't get deck building type of games. The strategies are opaque to me, outside of just trying to get some quality cards in the deck and trying to get them cycled. Past that, being anal enough to order the cards properly is way too precise.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The main mechanisms of City of Iron are the action point allowance system as well as the area majority. Yes, there are cards you use to form a deck, but I’d argue that “deck building” as a mechanism is a stretch! There are lots of different cards to buy and add to your deck, but you basically only buy a handful or two, and you run through your deck less than that… It was a nice touch that the two decks were separated into military and civilian decks so that you could shape your strategy after your temper, but as I said you rarely get to play the cards. To me, the deck building didn’t work at all.

Luckily other things did. I like that you score points during the game depending on how many resources you have on the cards you’ve bought, and that this is at the same time what brings you some money during the game. I’m a sucker for area majority games, and while this part is only so in the loosest sense, it still works quite well I think. 

I love that you need to colonize new areas so that you can get some of the better cards which show up later in the game (it’s divided into three phases). I also like that you can go for military colonization and that you can attack each other if they have some colonies – but if they don’t, you cannot do it, so again you’re still choosing if you want to go the more hostile way or if you just want to mind your own business. I’m definitely intrigued by this game, though I highly doubt that it’s a game I would love to play more than a handful of times.

City of Iron is a blast.  It has it all: clever mechanics, beautiful artwork, quality components, and a high replay value.  The game is complex, with a wide-open decision space, yet it is easy to teach.

Played once and is a bit abstract. Civilization type  game where you build you fantastic civilization, plenty of cards, some counters, money and a common play board. No maps. I think a map would give the game a more natural play experience. For gamers, not family. Wonderfull art, wish all games would be so artistic.

RATING: 7
An incredible civ-building title, with artwork second to none. Taking inspiration from the earlier Empires of the Void, the two decks (one military-based, the other diplomatic) are extremely well implemented (and with unique decks for each of the four civilisations, there us plenty of replayability and strategic adaptation), as is the city-development aspect (expand or establish on new grounds, higher risk but rewards). However, there is a fair amount of resource values to keep track of, which can lead to a little downtown as players ensure the right tokens are being spent/tracks moved on, but... such is the nature of this genre.  A solid hit.

RATING: N/A
Solo variant: 
The point salad variant with a 5 card building offer; a beat your own score sorta thing. I use the point salad reference card and cover the various spots on it as I gain the different levels of resources (makes tracking income and scoring way easier). I do not use the big board, I instead made an index card with spots to track actions, rounds, and points. I have been using the three and four player cards for added variety. Other than that (and attacking each other's towns) it's the same game.
I've played CoI solo 6 times in the last day and am having a blast. Fantasy steampunk civ puzzle extravaganza!

Kickstarted a copy of Lost Valley, so wanted this, just so many Kickstarter projects you can afford at $55,$50 being retired. I am no fan of deck building, just sold that overrated Dominion off. From the demo and Tom Vasel review off Kickstarter doesn't look like deck building although it seems to smell a little like one. Seems like it might be as enjoyable as Lords of Waterdeep, aka not too heavy on anyone thing, like the war theme part and have the appeal that LoW does across the board, no pun intended. It does look like "a lot going on", but so did LoW from video reviews and it wasn't. For some reason I like that art work. Hope enough copies are printed to get into retailers for a good supply.

City of Iron is geen spel dat je zo maar even tussen de soep en de patatten op tafel legt. Het is een diep strategisch spel dat je een aantal keer zal moeten spelen om echt goed te worden. Bovendien is dit spel heel vernieuwend. Ik ken geen enkel spel waarmee je City of Iron kan vergelijken. Dat maakt City of Iron uniek.

This may be one of the better kickstarter games I've tried.  Though I still have some issues with it.  For one, why is it necessary to let players steal cards from each other.  That's lame and unfun.  Also, I wish it wasn't so painfully slow to get cards drawn.  Other than that, though, I think there's a fine skeleton here.  Would like to try again.

Cool pseudo deck-building game where you try to build two decks simultaneously (which can be hard the first time or two you play the game I guess?). Still not overly complicated.

I liked it, but think we will play the friendly (not attacking other players) variant the next time as the last round was simply one high-scoring town going around the table. Not that exciting.

I love the art and presentation in the game, well done!

Fun game, but I'm not sure how much it will hold up to repeated plays.  There's not a ton of variability in it.  Still, I'm looking forward to trying it again.  The rule about when to score VPs is very confusing as it conflicts with the player summary card.  Also, make sure you have a ton of table space of this game.  There is stuff scattered all over!

I was super-hyped to get hold of this after reading about it, and waited patiently for it's release in the UK. I was not disappointed. A very cutthroat, beautifully designed euro game with fantastic artwork. I have not tried any of Red Raven Games other titles but City of Iron was a good marker that made me want to.

The games greatest triumph IMO is that you always feel like you don't have enough time to do everything you want to do. This forces you to learn to be efficient, and that is the hallmark of a good euro.

CoI is your fairly standard eurogame: increase resource loads, buy cards, earn VPs, etc. But it has a deck building component which was at least interesting (two decks) and the decks are never shuffled. I guess I didn't really like this aspect too much, as I felt it relied on one's memory a little too much to make it work and to actually consider all the things to make it expertly work is a lot more mental effort than I'm wanting to put into a game like this. So I didn't even really try to make the non-shuffled aspect of the deck work for me, and it didn't really cause a problem. Other than that, this is a fairly standard Euro which very nice artwork and cards that have multiple functions and not enough opportunities to make decisions and so forces each player to be very economical in the decisions they make. That's all stuff I like. So this game didn't blow my mind, but I would play it again and I don't think it makes any terrible missteps at any point.

After becoming enamored with the art in [thing=142326]Eight Minute Empire: Legends[/thing], then roped into the gameplay of [thing=168609]Artifacts, Inc[/thing], I started poking around other Ryan Laukat games and found this one.  The mix of steampunk, fantasy, and Hayao Miyazaki (namely Porco Rosso and Howl's Moving Castle) instantly drew me in. Watching a playthrough of it made me a true convert. It's a very enjoyable themed Euro with some accommodation for confrontational gameplay, in a similar bracket with Manhattan Project but with more of a market control aspect.

@Joel Eddy, you're so wrong on this one, mostly because you came into it with Through The Ages on the brain (what?).  It's an especially beautiful game if you don't dwell on the "beginner's game" and play with the full rules + the expansion.

Beautiful game, wonderfully produced.  I can see it having a following, as there are a lot of mechanics that IMO don't really come together, but do make for complicated decision making.  I have only played once, so this is just a first impression.  The game seems overly complicated for an area majority game.  The asymmetric player positions didn't do much for me, as they seemed more constraining than interesting.  Buying the cards that score majorities seemed pretty chaotic as well, and the deck building brought in more chaos.  Area majority scoring means there's also a substantial pick on the leader element.  In the end, I didn't want to play it again, just get it over with (and I won).

All that said, it's an ambitious design, and beautifully produced.  There are many different ways to approach it strategically, and there's a little bit of everything from a mechanics standpoint.  For me, it just didn't come together well enough to leave me wanting more. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Great artwork and an original mix of familiar mechanics with a few unique aspects to the game. Design is very coherent and balanced.  Using the board to denote your resources is welcomed.  I usually prefer a bunch of cubes, etc. but there are plenty of cards/cardboard to adorn your play area and to build/fiddle with. Very fun to play! Replays have improved my opinion of the game.

RATING: 9.5
Why is this game so awesome?  I can't quite put my finger on it, but it has quickly become a favorite!

I avoided this game at first because of the deckbuilidng element.  I'm generally not a fan of such games.  Somehow I forgot that was the case and decided to buy it on a bit of whim.  On our first game, I missed a rather central rule and thought that players started with full decks.  At the end of our first round, I realized my mistake and we started playing (mostly) correctly.  As soon as we finished, we were discussing what we wanted to try the next time we played, which happened a few days later.  

This is a deckbuilder with two distict decks per player: Citizens and Soldiers, each starting with merely two cards.  Scoring is by set collection via either purchasing buildings cards or conquering towns.  Players expand their capacity by two different means: add districts to cities or explore new cities).  

It sounds like a mess, but it plays like a dream.  Surprisingly, it is not difficult to teach.  The cards provide so much variety, but the handful of key concepts are all rather straightforward.  

When first playing the game, the expansion is not needed.  There is a LOT of game in the main box.  However, the expansion adds significant variety to the four different nations.  This comes in the form of many nation-specific cards to add to the decks.  

Simply an amazing game!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Simple area majority game (control is measured in the amount of production your buildings provide for each of 10 different goods - most production equals control of that "area"). Building cards are selected from a track in the style of Manhattan Project but without the dynamic interaction between buildings. Additional choice of actions is provided by "worker" cards that you draft into 2 decks - some good deck building options here but not enough to save the otherwise average game play.

The game is administratively messy with lots of cards and tokens and adding up of factors and it spreads over a big area - more effort than the game play justifies. 

The board, tokens and cards are all good quality. Art is good.

Wow this is a deap and tense game, im very impressed with this one.
It ai lavish production with beautiful art work and high quality components.
I do wish the player powers had a larger empact on game play but this is a miner quibble, my only real isue is the rule book. It is well written and decently laid out but it is lacking significant information about the differnt cards in the game. The cards are basic and not really complex but some of the wording is confuseing and could use a nice card index. Now with that said the game play is stronge the player interaction is as in your face as the players want it to be, and I can't recommend this game enough. I want to see what else Red Raven games have going because this it a top self production.

This took a very long time to play (4-player) and I recall that halfway through we realized a bunch of things about strategy that made it a lot more fun and move somewhat faster. I seem to have failed in my attempt to write those things down so that I could ever play the game again.

The rulebook is sort of nebulously awful, though. It's not vague, it's not incorrect, it's not actively confusing... it's just way harder to learn the game from than it should be. Don't ask me why; if I understood exactly why, I'd be making bank as a rulebook editor.

(At least, I assume that rulebook editors charge high enough rates to be filthy rich. That's the only possible explanation for why so many games don't seem to have had one...)

Love the art. 

There are so many neat things incorporated into this game, from the turn order bidding, economy, set collecting (to keep from paying science more than once for a type of building), deck building from within your own faction cards, mild combat element and action allowance. 

You only have 3 actions in each round, but there are cards you can play that offer free actions. So depending on how you build your deck, you can chain together some free actions before taking your normal action. 

So many choices of who/what from your faction that you can recruit into your hand. Do you want to explore new lands, or add more districts you your current lands? Do you want to go with military to conquer towns for their resources? 

Do you build a lot of cheaper resource buildings or go for the more expensive ones that earn more VP's? 

I just got the Experts and Engines expansion and can't wait to give that a try.

RATING: 5
This is a game with an interesting theme and beautiful artwork.  However, it seems like there might be some design flaws, at least for 3 players.  Specifically, if only one player chooses the military strategy (buying and drawing military cards to take over uncontrolled towns), they will probably win -- they don't have to spend as much money on buying buildings or civilian cards, their controlled towns advance them on the resource tracks even if they haven't explored to obtain appropriate terrain cities, and the controlled towns will never be taken away by weaker opponents.

I'm not sure if it's worth a second play.

RATING: 8
After one play, I just want more of it! The theme isn't strong, but has a nice flavour to it. The gameplay however I find very interesting, and it seems that there is multiple ways to victory... More plays will tell!

My only gripe with the game is the table space it takes, and there is so much stuff that doesn´t fit on the game board. If you have a table that is somewhat too small, then it can get very hard to keep track of all information/stuff. This can lead to mistakes that could ruin the game for you!

I wanted to like this game, but it just fell totally flat for me.  Visually, it's one of the best games I've ever played.  But the gameplay was lacking: a whole bunch of mechanisms moving around just to have the majority in icons, a very simplistic win condition?  Non-thematic to build buildings in order to get resources- usually games have that order reversed.  If it were an hour game I might play it again but at 3 hours it was much, much too long.

Wow, why hasn't this game gotten more buzz??  This is actually my favorite of the four no-shuffle deckbuilders of 2013.  Everything about it is clever.  The tradeoff between exploring (which is expensive) and getting more cities (which doesn't provide as much space), the management of three different kinds of resources (cards, money and books), the scoring, the importance of managing your economy and your space, the way that deck refreshment works (the order in which cards are played dictates how they'll come out next time) are all really cool. I love the art and the theme--I'm kind of a sucker for steampunk, so YMMV, but it's undeniably pretty.  The only knocks that I have on the game are these: 1) the way that cards are added to decks gives players a lot of control, but also creates a potential for serious AP, and 2) I wish that the Chvatil-style endgame scoring (most cards, most lands, etc) allowed something for second place.  

Anyway, VERY interesting game and I'm all for it. I want to get a copy and play it some more.  Provisionally rated an 8 only because I'm a little leery of going over a rating of 8 on the first play. (1 play)

Not at all sure how to rate this after one play. One thing's for sure: It's gorgeous. My main concern is how much interaction there really is -- it seems like it might be very much a solitaire-ish engine-building puzzle with the only interaction coming via the Airlines Europe/Get the Goods/Medici majority scoring -- which is better than nothing -- but attacking other player's cities seems really difficult. But I'm not sure we got all the rules right in our game (rulebook is vague on many points), so I could be wrong, and I hope that's the case because there's a lot to like. Another concern is that it seemed to go a bit long, but I might just have felt that way because I was losing badly.

An interesting city building/deck building game. You build and engine, but the game is only 7 rounds. So the guy who built the best engine in our game, came in dead last. I'd like another play.

There's a lot going on with this game; deck building, resource gathering and management, limited actions per turn, attacking, and exploration, but it manages to combine them all without feeling overwhelming or overly convoluted.

The main reason why I love CoI is its superb deck-building system, which is eons ahead of anything else. The multiple paths to victory, thematic feel, and unique mechanisms make for a great experience.

This would have been a perfect 10 if the races were made different. 1 card and a minor power don't cut it, Ryan. Make them different, like you did in Empires of the Void. Give us more than we'll use in one game, like in EotV. And then, this game would be perfect.

UPDATE: After a couple of disappointing games, I've come to the conclusion that while I love the concept of CoI, it falls flat quite often. That is mostly due to its pace: downtime between turns is loooooong with 4, and the resource majority doesn't shine with less... Also, very little replayability, since all buildings come out every game, and the factions feel more or less the same. Makes me sad. :(

Area of control, deck builder, hand management, and economic game. I have not played with the player powers, but they seem completely unbalanced (purely observational). The game takes place over 3 scoring rounds (A, B, and C). Players build buildings to gain goods which give them gold and points during the score round. There are a couple of unique things here, but overall the game seems to focus around two main strategies and/or a combination of the two. I like the auction for player order, but that seems to be very predictable. I will play again, but won't go out of my way to do so.

In City of Iron, 2-4 players compete to build up a small nation in a world of machines, magic, and money. Become the leader of one of four rival races: the industrious humans, the toad engineers, the scholarly Cresarians, or the clever hogmen.

Corner the market on goods like machine parts or bottled demons. Research steam-age technology and recruit mercenaries to control the continent. Build sea-going schooners or cloud-cutting airships to reach faraway lands and flying islands. Your cities have limited capacity, so you’ll have to decide what to keep and what to demolish when building advanced structures.

The future of a nation is in your hands. Build unbreakable foundations for an empire or disappear into the dusty pages of history.

Played once, 3p.  This is actually a pretty decent deck-builder with a heavy set collection influence.  I feel that it has a few too many "things" going on, though.  Either too many ways to score VP, or too many resources to keep track of, or something.  It did seem like it would be fairly viable for there to be 3 different strategies in play at any time.  I'd like to play again to refine my opinion.

RATING: 6
An interesting combination of goods majority scoring, buildings & resource management and deck-buying/building. Occasionally, it takes some planing/time midway to determine which cards to buy.  Probably not wise to play with analysis paralysis players though and, not so bad with 2 or 3 players.

This is a game I'm happy to play, but I don't need to own.  I did enjoy this one far more than I expected and do look forward to playing again - however, I'd rather play other games in the same time frame.  There is an interesting interaction of "deckbuilding", resource management, a couple different currencies, acquiring via travel or attack different types of lands or cities, and more.  Most of the scoring occurs from scoring majorities in the different resources - cards which you are purchasing or conquering.  I did not much care for the art in this game - a bit too brown/dark and too many straight lines...I don't mind steampunk, but this didn't even evoke that theme for me.

While it's a little long (hence a slightly lower rating), this game is diverse, and fought with tough decisions. The 2nd edition and rules tweaks are clearly superior to the original. I'm also thankful for the art updates as Ryan has really grown in that respect over the years. 

I'd put this in the same category as Mage Knight in terms of weight and how deck building affects play.

RATING: 6
A very pretty game with an appealing set of mechanics, City of Iron suffers from having its whole be less than the sum of its parts.  

First, it is quite long, even as a 2-player game, and with new or unfamiliar players, it drags on even longer; the deck-building mechanic is particularly at fault for this aspect.  

Second, even as a 4-player game, it suffers from last turn syndrome.  Yes, players can bid for turn order (to be first or last), but this heavily favors a big money economy, thus making some seemingly alternate paths to victory not truly viable.  Realistically, you need to be a player in all aspects of the game, and cannot invest in a strong single or dual-area strategy; this makes turns much longer, as every decision needs to be efficient.

The game is zero-sum with any player count, and can be quite vicious as regards capturing towns from other players.  For a game that is otherwise an Euro which has other, less pernicious forms of direct competition, this element is unnecessary and simply not fun from either side of the conquest.

Taken individually, the deck-building, cards as currency and actions, resource market competition, exploration and conquest, and building management are interesting.  A few combined would make an excellent game with a much more manageable time frame.  

Taken together, City of Iron gives the player the sense that they are playing a good game, but one that is by no means great, and once they finish playing 2.5 - 3+ hours later, City of Iron leaves players with the feeling that they could have played much more satisfying games in that same amount of time.

As to be expected, the art is fantastic (just like the rest of Laukat's games).  This is a hand building, economic engine building, area control (or the equivalent) with combat.  It's also a tight game since you're limited to 3 actions per round - gotta make 'em count!  

Unfortunately, I don't see this one getting enough play to keep a place on my shelf.  I have quite a few hand building games that I love - Lewis & Clark, Concordia, Rococo, & Baseball Highlights just to name a few - that I would pull out first..  I would happily play someone else's copy, though.

This is better than Ancient World.  Much more interesting decisions, but same great art. I'm also pretty fond of Eight Minute Empire: Legends.

After my first play of this game I wasn't that excited to play again.  However, in my small group, this seemed to be the game that no one vetoed so i had the opportunity to play more than I necessarily would have liked.  With that said, it has grown on me.  There are many paths to victory and I find them all intresting to play.  A few negatives for me that i want to write down so i can see if it is just due to few plays:
1 - Bidding seems awfully odd, I'd rather there be a process to determine turn order that result in actions and not bidding
2 - certain cards never seem to get bought, no matter how extreme/focused one may be on a specific strategy
3 - The winner is usually the player who has executed the strategy that the fewest others are also executing

Stunning artwork. Love the unique take on deck building. I've heard this might be broken for 2-player play, but I've only played it 2 player and really enjoy it. If you're worried about the military path being too strong, it's easy to solve by requiring two cities to increase the income by one (instead of the one for one).

Excellent game!!! It is now in my top 20 ! The art is amazing, the game lets player decide their strategy. It plays relatively fast with 2 players. The fun of the game is building an engine with the deck of cards. Conquering towns feels different than building buildings.

This game has quite a few mechanics mixed together. Not really much of a deck-builder although that's sorta part of the game (you don't really churn through a deck though). Much more of a careful planning, card management, resource collection game. Haven't quite figured it out yet. Bottom line is there's a lot to do but you'll probably fail if you try to do it all!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A single play left us confused. The set collection which the scoring hinges on is overly simplistic, the primary mechanisms of conquering towns and acquiring lands and cities still pretty straightforward, but backed by a deckbuilding scheme that makes A Few Acres of Snow look like Candy Land. Clearly familiarity with the card pool will increase strategic understanding, but the simplicity of the rest of the game calls into question whether one should bother. I'll need to play it a time or two more to come to a real conclusion, but it is hard to get it to the table.

It's been nearly a year since my first play and I haven't got it back to the table so rating it a 6 and moving on with life.

OMG ... we love love love this game; it´s the perfect mix of several ideas: deck building, which reminds us a little bit of FEW ACRES OF SNOW, a ressource and VP-System which you permanently have to keep an eye on, lots of economic decisions you have to make, while you try to keep your strategies flowing and last but not least ... the graphics ... WOW ... you can smell the green of the meadows folks while looking at the pictures; and what is important as well, there is no luck in your play, no dice no event cards, even the sequence of the cards in your discard pile is planned by yourself, while you discard them - no shuffling requested. The game misses the perfect 10 only for a not well written rulebook and a card printing quality that let´s you definitely put your cards in sleeves (what you might do anyway ...)

After a first attempt, this seems like a game that you will need to explain a lot about, and then keep in rotation. 

As long as everybody still remembers the rules, and no serious AP is running, you should stay well below 2h with 4 players.

Will need a few plays to get the hang of all the options though.

Cool looking board, love the style Red Raven is using :)

Odd but fun. From the Ameritrash-y cover art, title and general buzz, I thought this would be a different game. Maybe one that involved city building or direct combat. Instead, discordantly, this is a game of resource accumulation and protection--but not conversion. As such, it might be perfect for my dad, who only knows to accumulate resources in euro games (at the end of Le Havre, he had umpteen cattle and grain, and very few points). The unusual resources provided a great deal of theme, and the game should go by quickly, but overall I felt like City of Iron was a jumble of dissonant ideas and mechanics. The flow of the game has a slap-dash, extemporaneous quality to it, jumping from one mini-activity to the next, the coup-de-grace of which is frenziedly rummaging through one's entire deck of 15 cards to determine which ones to purchase.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
---Preliminary thoughts---

Deckbuilding game that promises more than it delivers. At the end, there's one advisable strategy, there are some better cards that everybody will strive to obtain, or to deny to their rivals.

Conquering is more powerful than civil expansion, but unsafe, because it can be reconquered by others. Thus, if warring players do not fight each other, the one of them that managed to put on the best militar machinery will win; if they fight each other too much, the civil player will win.

With 4 players, more important than your strategy is whether your rivals pick against you or not.

The art is very cool, I love the theme, and there are a couple of very nice mechanics (bidding for initiative, setting the draw order when discarding, and some skills in the cards).

Overall, the game is a bit long, but my main concerns are these:
-> Conquering is more powerful (seems fair because you are unsafe), but it creates balances issues (even if you are a civil race, you will conquer some terrains and you will still be vulnerable (even more than a fighting race that has more conquered terrains, but a much better military force to steal more territories).
-> I don't like games where your rivals can gang bang you out of the game, and this is the case (even if they lose something by doing that).

City of Iron is a no-shuffle deckbuilder--you buy cards from a private pool and put them in your discard pile, but when your deck runs out, you simply flip the deck over. This has a pretty deep economic engine where you're trying to get majorities in different resources for bonus money, but also figure out ways to get extra card draws in two different decks, and also get your hands on research, a vital alternate resource. And of course, you have limited space to place the essential money- and card-generating buildings. It all fit together very well for a rich experience.

This game is totally up my alley. Also finally a Kickstarter-game that is above mediocre level. It's a sort of deckbuilding-game (but you are responsible for the order of your cards yourself, as well as how fast/slow you will cycle through your deck), where you want majority's in certain (but the most as possible :D) goods? therefore you need mostly money, but sometimes also science. Very nice artwork also!

Better than expected.  The artwork is really nicely done and gameplay doesn't disappoint, especially for fans of area majority and deckbuilding.  There are a couple flaws hopefully fixed by the expansion.  Military is too strong in two-player (it is more balanced in multiplayer), the race powers are not balanced and exploring new lands is both infinitely cooler and more powerful than expanding existing ones.  Since the mechanics of the game really only allow for one or the other, this leaves are area of the game largely undeveloped.  Oh, and the bid track is silly and hardly every used in its entirety.

This is a truly excellent majorities game, where players compete to have the most of a bunch of different resources and the end of each of three scoring rounds. The game has lots of interesting mechanisms, such as some minor deckbuilding, the ability to bid not only to go first, but to go last, and a few different ways of gathering the symbols you need. The different player powers have some asymmetry, which is intriguing, but because some of the asymmetry comes from the cards in player's personal purchasable supply these differences are not always apparent, at least not after one play. I believe this is my favorite Red Raven game so far.

Not my favorite game from Ryan but I'll still play it. I dont mind confrontation in a game where you sit down and know exactly what you are getting into, like battle games (battlelore, war of the ring and so on) but Im realizing Im less a fan of games that you spend lots of time building and planning and then someone can decide to be a jerk on the last turn and just swoop in a ruin what you are working on. Thats not to say this game is poorly designed (thats why I still rate it high) I just have other games from Ryan I would pick over this one.

On it's own, City of Iron is a decent deck construction/management game. There are multiple paths to victory and enough player interaction to keep things interesting. I rate this. 7 for two reasons:
1. Sometimes the escalation of cards/points feels clunky. Some of the esrly actions don't mean much in the grand scheme of scoring.
2. The designer really streamlined/perfected his style of games with Ancient World. City of Iron feels like a downgrade in comparison.

I have only played this once, in August 2014 - I expected that it would get played again soon, but it hasn't been since and I now don't expect it ever will. Not that the game is bad at all - there are some quite interesting mechanics here, what with the card drawing and deckbuilding to go alongside the resource management in order to acquire buildings, which produce extra income and victory points by (hopefully) giving you majorities in certain resources. But ultimately it didn't feel at all compelling either, and at no point have I felt a particular desire to play again.

Not as good at Above and Below since there's not story element, although CoI is a lot more interactive since you are competing with players for 1st or 2nd place on goods tracks.  It has a very interesting card drafting mechanism, where you are purchasing cards from your personal deck, which once played will then continue in circulation through your 2 draw decks.  You start with only 2 cards in each of these decks, so a lot of your strategy centers around which cards you draft, since these will then be used repeatedly Dominion-style and determine what strategic path you take. The discard piles for these decks are not shuffled but are simply flipped over when your draw deck runs out, so that creates a natural sequencing of your actions.  Like Above and Below, there is a lot of tension in that you only have 3 actions each turn, which doesn't feel like enough to get done what you want, especially since at least early only it's very difficult to draw enough cards to do what you want to do.  One problem is that because a primary way to get cards in your hand is purchasing new ones rather than drawing your old ones, you have to plan ahead of time exactly what you're going to do for your 3 actions and purchase the appropriate cards, so this can create quite a bit of AP, although everyone's doing this at the same time.

This is a heavy European style board game where you battle with other players over alien resources.  The players get points for controlling the most resources on the board. The players gain resources by building buildings in discovered lands and conquering other alien towns that produce resources.  The players have a hand of cards for their race and can purchase these cards each round to gain money to buy buildings or discover new lands to gain more options or build armies to conquer towns. 

Pros: excellent deck building mechanic, heavy strategy aspect,many choices and options.fun steampunk theme

Cons:very long game play especially for indecisive players, takes up quite a bit of space on the table.

I love Ryan Laukat's artwork, but this is a so-so engine-building game. It's got a lot of fiddly rules that don't feel tied to the theme and are easy to forget, such as discarding the first building on the track when someone attacks a town.  The end of each turn is an AP quagmire, as you have to figure out which citizen and military cards to buy and plan out what you're intending to do with your actions next turn and what buildings you'll want to try to buy then and thus what you should bid for turn order.

The central mechanic of the citizen and military decks looks like deck-building, but it's not.  No hand limit, no discarding until you use cards, and getting the small amount of cards you use back in the order you chose to discard them all combine to act as a set of purchasable powers that refresh every turn or two, very unlike most deck-building games.  I honestly feel like it would just work better as cards that you bought and put face-up in front of you, then tapped to use them and replaced draws with untapping a card.

I'd be willing to play again in theory, but overall it fails the why-am-I-not-playing-a-game-that-excites-me-instead test.

A nice civ building game that finishes pretty quickly.  The balance of buildings(permanent abilities) and cards(deck building, have to be able to draw) really clicked with me.
Needs another play, the cards may not have enough variety to sustain interest.

RATING: 9
Excellent game with great thematic art. You need a big table surface for this one! 

Limited player actions and scarce resources lead to tough and interesting choices throughout. In isolation each game mechanism has a familiar feel to it, but the way they work together makes for an overall unique experience. The deck building/hand management part of the game is the most nuanced and complex aspect of game play, especially when buying new cards for your hand. The different faction abilities add flavor to the theme, but are relatively minor in terms of their overall impact. 

It definitely takes a few plays to become competitive and inexperienced players will struggle against experienced ones (even more so than most other games). Newer players tend to miss the importance of messing with your opponents' plans. Treat this as multiplayer solitaire at your own peril!

City of Iron is essentially an area majority game with goods instead of areas. It has a bunch of amazing ideas, and it is incredibly fun to play, but it has a few rough edges. The 2 player rules as printed reward diversification too much due to the lack of competition on the goods tracks. Playing with a variant with a dummy player at 3 on all of the goods tracks solves this problem nicely. With 3 or 4 players there is enough competition for goods that a dummy player is unnecessary.

In the base game, the factions mostly add flavor, and are not strictly balanced. You can play without them, and I don't think it makes enough of a difference to hurt the balance of the game much; a good player will still beat a weak player, and your decisions in game have a much larger impact than your faction. With the Experts and Engines expansion added, the factions feel much more different. So far they seem reasonably well balanced, but I don't have a large enough sample size to know.

I don't like the way that attacking eachother's towns works. It works okay in theory, but in practice it seems to make dabbling in military have significantly less upside, as a heavy military strategy can very easily conquer any of your towns that they want. I think the game works better if you don't allow players to attack already conquered towns.

The Town Card Expansion that came with my Kickstarter copy unbalances the game somewhat in favor of military if you play with it as printed. If you just play with 3 randomly chosen extra towns instead of replenishing them as they get taken, they add a bit of flavor without completely changing the balance of the game.

I'm not totally satisfied with the end game scoring bonuses, but I haven't put the analysis I would need into a possible change yet. I'd like to try 2nd edition, where the end game scoring bonuses have been moved to the land tiles, so that exploring is a little more valuable and only the person with that land tile can earn those points if they meet their goal. 

Even without making any changes, City of Iron is a fantastic 4 player game and a good 3 player game. 2 player is not that satisfying without the dummy player I added though.

This is a pretty interesting deck-building game! There is a lot going on, with the deck-building being only a part of it. And the best part? There is no constant deck shuffling -- in fact, no shuffling at all! It took a while figuring out how the game works, but in fact game play is pretty smooth. The card row works well to keep the game moving, and should help make every game a bit different. I would like to try this one again!

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
This is a deck-building, area-majority game with a steampunk theme. Players each are a different race/faction, with slightly different abilities. They start with the same 2 decks of cards (military and civilian cards, 2 cards each) but they each also have their own supplies of these cards from which they will be adding cards to their decks. They also start with a city tile with 4 terrain types, with one district tile on it (the 5 = max number of resource cards allowed in the city). Several other city tiles, showing a distance (4-8 compasses), a variety of terrains, and possibly a ship or airship icon, are placed nearby. The central board has a card row where cards (in 3 groups for phases 1-3) will appear. These are mostly resource cards (~10 types in the game; cards show 1+ resource icons, and requisite terrain). The board also has a track for each resource; these are used to show each player's current total in each resource. The tracks also show the coins earned at the end of each turn to the player(s) furthest in the track, and the VP earned for 1st/2nd place players each scoring round (3 in the game). 3 decks of town cards are shuffled and placed next to the board. Players may look through the deck, but do not change the order.

Each turn, players bid for turn order. Then, each player takes an action in order, a total of 3 actions each. Actions are things like:
- build a card (from the display or that you'd previously stored): pay its cost (coins) and put it in a city with the requisite terrain. Update the central board resource counter for that resource type.
- store a card: take it from display and set it aside (may build it later)
- play a card from your hand. These do a variety of things like collect coins, attack a town (top card of one of the 3 town decks, or another player's town; have a range and defense -- you spend cards with compass icons for range, and military strength for defense), discover a new city (play cards with requisite icons: compasses, possibly ship or airship icon; then place a new district tile on it), add a district to one of your cities (increases the allowable number of resource cards), etc. All spent cards are placed in appropriate (military/civilian) discard deck.

After 3 actions/player, everyone:
- collects income (1 per resource card built, plus income for players with the most of each resource)
- draw cards according to your districts (they allow you to draw either a civilian or military card from your deck). If draw deck empty, flip discard pile over (no shuffling).
- spend coin(s) to buy cards from your Supply; these are added to your hand (no hand limit)
- advance card row (first several cards discarded, others slide forward, new cards drawn); if End of Phase card drawn, Scoring will occur after next round.

Scoring: for each resource type, award VP to 1st/2nd place players as shown. There are bonuses for being especially high on most resource tracks.

The 3rd End of Phase card is at bottom of deck. Game ends the turn after that card is drawn. Some end-game bonuses (e.g., most towns, most compasses on city tiles, etc.) are awarded; then most VP wins.

RATING: 8
This game is deceptively deep, at least for me it was.  There's a lot of STUFF in this game and a lot of moving parts which is what attracted me to it in the first place but once I started reading the rulebook the actual gameplay seemed like it might disappoint me a bit.  I was very pleasantly surprised by the amount of choices I had in this game.

The game is sort of hard to describe in game mechanic terms.  There is economic engine and deck building but also some minor combat and hand management elements and a bunch of other stuff going on that makes a very elegant game system that works incredibly well.  Each round starts with an auction for turn order.  Then players take turns in this order taking one of several actions.  Those actions being drawing and playing cards from your hand, building buildings that give you special effects or produce resources, collecting resources, or attacking neutral towns.  A large chunk of this game are the resource tables.  Most buildings you build and towns you conquer generate resources.  Whoever has the most of any of the 10 different resources gets money at the end of every round and points at the end of 3 scoring rounds.

There's a little bit of player interaction too since you're allowed to attack neutral towns already conquered by other players as well as unconquered neutral towns.  Also, this game has a great many neat little mechanics but one of my favorites is the ability as an action to "save" a building to be built later.  The greatest cost of this of course is that now you are taking two actions to build that structure when normally it would take only one if you could place it immediately into one of your cities.  Also, if it is not built by game end you lose a point.  However this is a great way to not only save valuable buildings you want but also deprive your opponents of buildings that would give them large point swings.  Each of the factions also has varying player powers, there's a neat little order system for your two personal decks of cards, and many other nifty mechanics gimmicks that I don't have the time to tell you all about.

My favorite part of the game though is how this intricate system of varied mechanics offers many paths to victory which all seem viable.  My first game was with the full complement of 4 and each of the players seemed to pursue a different path.  Exploration, combat, hybrid, different goods, money generation, card draw, etc. and while there was a clear winner, being as it was all of our first game, it was also clear his strategy wasn't necessarily the "best".  I love games you can play differently every time and that actually be a viable way to play the game.

The components are pretty good but I personally don't particularly care for the art.  I was also disappointed that except for special cards for particular factions all the faction decks looked exactly the same.  The game also has a huge footprint and can go for 2 hours or a little longer, especially considering setup.  But it didn't feel like it took forever to me.  Overall a fantastically designed and fun game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Some very neat ideas - turn order especially and the quasi deck building element. However, not excited by the economic mushroom or the number of different tracks. Also the game comes to a grinding halt whenever players need to chose new cards. I guess this speed up with repeat play but it creates a horrible hiatus in the experience.

The path through the game feels a little linear and should max out at a 75 minute game - the final third feels unnecesary

Other mechanics seem like a  lift from other designs - the card track, the majorities scoring for the goods.

The art work manages to be both beguiling and amateurish at the same time - and for a KS game the production values are not amazing.

Overall solid but not really adding anything (apart from Turn order)

We were able to finish the game in about 2.5 hours with 3 players, probably a little bit longer than what I would like it to be. The phase where we buy new cards for our deck can be an AP prone. I found it quite challenging in selecting the cards since they dictate the strategy for the game. This will certainly be a game that I won't refuse to play, but probably not one that I will keep.

City of Iron is trying hard to do something different, which I appreciate. Everything from theme to its mish-mash of mechanics are trying to come together in a unique and challenging combination. While I can't call the game outright innovative (as in an entirely new concept), I do give it full credit for attempting to make something entirely new with existing ingredients.

The first thing I noticed about City of Iron was its refreshing theme (or at least a unique steampunk/fantasy theme that isn't all about wizards and goblins). While the theme quickly fades into the background as the game mechanics move front and center, it is nice to have an evocative cast of characters holding the narrative together.

The gameplay is in solid Euro-territory. Although City of Iron appeared at first like it was going to be a resource collection/conversion games, it's actually more akin to an area control game where the different resources are the "areas." The deck-building element feels a bit underdeveloped, but, at the same time helps to drive your strategy. There just aren't enough options in the deck for it to feel like a true deck-building experience -- more like a tacked on mechanism that nonetheless works for its stated purpose.

All in all, I enjoyed the game; however, I did find the play time too long. The listed play-time is two hours. I would like to see that cut by at least a half hour. The final 25% felt repetitive and anti-climatic, which is really too bad for such an otherwise enjoyable experience. I have yet to play the revised edition; perhaps it addresses some of these concerns?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.8
A wonderful realization of what a thematic euro can be. The mechanisms are clever, but what really sells the game is the way those mechanisms tie into the theme and artwork - oh, the glorious artwork - to create the experience of building up a chugging, industrious and potentially hostile little empire. Because each player is building his own deck of characters to shape the type of game he will play (Military conquest or exploration? By air or by sea? Harvest glow moss or manufacture machine parts?), each player will have a unique experience.

The basic game provides a large amount of strategic depth on its own, but the town card expansion and nation abilities add even more variety, meaning this one will provide fresh gameplay for quite a long time. The one knock against it is that the rulebook is underbaked, meaning you will probably have to consult BGG forums for some clarifications.

The game has a very distinct and somehow unique feel to it. It takes quite a few elements/mechanics from other games and alters them respectively they are being altered by the combination of mechanisms. The Action mechanism reminds of Goa, the storing of cards and saving them for later (while being penalized when you didn't build them before game end) reminds of St. Petersburg, Hand Management and trying to score high on the different goods tracks took me back to Medici surprisingly enough and the deck building is quite a bit off from Dominion. Assuming you play without the different fraction advantages, every set contains the same one-of-a-kind cards here (no buying ten markets here, no wild combos). You have to decide which of these cards you want to bring into the game. And the real twist here lies within the rule that you can decide in which order you discard and once you have to draw and no cards are left, you just flip the discard pile in the order it was in. Without all that shuffling! 
Overall the game felt nicely balanced, it was quite pleasant to play and the artwork is outstanding.

Ryan Laukat's art is brilliant (though that's probably nothing surprising). I wasn't quite as keen on the gameplay during my first (and only, at the time of this writing) play, though. I prefer being able to get rid of my weaker cards in deckbuilders, and there didn't seem to be any options to do this here. 
Other than that, a reasonably solid game and one I wouldn't mind playing again. But it's not making me dance for joy and I see no reason to add this to my own collection.

This is a very interesting game. Some people will not like it, but it is a well designed game that offers what many other games fail to offer in our days: Originality! It is not a deck building but you develop a deck. It is not a war game but you can win by attacking other people towns. It is not an economic game, but you have to manage an economy to win. It is not Dominion, there is a lot more strategy here. As you see , it is hard to describe in which category of games this game fits. It has some interesting mechanisms of deck building, like no shuffling of your deck. Many interesting strategies can result by just that. Also there are 3-4 different paths to victory. You have to choose whatever it is optimal in the position that you play, and not what you think has a better chance to win the game before you start the game. This is a gamer's game and not a game for families. If you like Caylus, Core Worlds, you should try to buy/play this game.

RATING: 7
City of Iron is a Ryan Laukat game that I had missed in the couple of years it has been out. Like most Laukat games, it's pretty and extremely tight. You end the game feeling like you there should have been another couple of turns, because you haven't gotten nearly enough done.

In the game, you play a kingdom that is competing to have the most of several different resources (like 10 or so). Each resource has it's own track, and players will get coins and/or points for being the leader in each resource. Most of the game revolves around getting advances on those tracks.

Each player has a deck of citizen cards and a deck of military cards. You only start with a couple of cards in each deck, but there's a huge deck of cards that you can buy new cards from to add to your pool. When you play cards you have to think about order a little bit, as your personal decks are never reshuffled, only flipped over, when they run out.

There's two main ways to advance on resource tracks. One way is to build buildings which usually give you income and some bumps on one or more tracks. That will mostly use your citizen cards. Alternatively, you can spend cards from your military deck to conquer towns, which will give you some resource bumps as well.

Money is fairly tight in the game, as are "books" which represent your scientific research ability. If you go the building route, you'll run into a limitation pretty quick, as you only have room for a few buildings on your land. You'll either need to upgrade your capital city or explore new lands. Exploring new lands is neat because it gives you new terrain types, which are prerequisites for certain buildings, and because each new land gives you an end-of-game bonus goal. I can't speak much to the military side of the game, as I completely ignored it in my first play.

The game was, as always, beautiful. I don't know that there was anything revolutionary here, but it was interesting and a lot of fun. I definitely want to play again. And I want to try to go the military route and see how that goes.

Love this game with all player counts (2-4)! The only drawbacks I can think of is that it (a) is quite a long game, (b) is a bit unbalanced when including the variable player powers and (c) does not have a well written rulebook. It was really useful to watch someone play this game on youtube before bringing it to the table myself. But the game feels fresh due to the very atmospheric artwork and its high level of player interaction - you will find yourself constantly jockeying for the best position on various goods. And the cardplay is really interesting, as there are more cards than you can possibly buy, forcing you to make strategic decisions each time you expand your deck(s). You always need more actions than you have, making for some hard decisions. That, combined with turn angst on some rounds, makes this a superb game for me!

Kind of a floopy mix between resource management and (sort-of) deckbuilding, but as a whole, this game works very well. I have the impression the game draws out a bit longer than it should, but I must say I like it a lot!
Feels like a work of love! I cannot praise this designer enough, as he worked out the game itself and drew all the art.

Love the Steampunk theme, love the attack aspects which remove it from the realm of a vanilla Euro economics game.

There is a decent basis for a game here, but it is kind of a pain to set up and play, and generally overstays its welcome.  It has a bunch of disparate mechanics that aren't really as good as other games in each mechanic.

The biggest problem is its length vs. The tension involved.

In this steampunk-ish world of magic and machines, divergent nations of toadmen, hog people, and humans are competing to build their empire. Primarily a deck builder of citizen and building cards. Very intriguing discard mechanic that impacts your future hand play.  Explore cities, and secure majority control over resources of moss, turnips, and salt. Such a rich world conveyed in the beautiful artwork, production quality and text. Interesting twist that military strategy is NOT the interactive play style.

Main reason this is not rated higher is the differences in the V2 and V3 rulebooks and some of V2 rules are used incorrectly in V3.
Slightly confusing, posted a question to Ryan in the forums for clarification.
Higher rating pending...

Very High trade value (she liked it), not very willing to part with it yet, but for the right offer... specifically Wishlist(1) games.

First few turn are easy going but as the game moves on the options do to gets way more complicated.

Slow deckbuilding system is really great. Alsway's an option to do.

An interesting mix of deckbuilding, city managment and trading, a euro with a theme that actually stands out a bit.

The art really drew me in. This game revolves around claiming the most production capacity of exotic goods, which provides you with income and points. But in order to build the production sites, you need money, science, and space to put them. To explore new lands, found new cities and build new districts, you have to manage your citizen deck and your military deck. 
Enamoured with this design, except for the attacking of each others towns.

Love the diversity in this game.  Carefully choosing what to spend your cash and science points on - build your decks or get more buildings into your city.  Balance a more effective military against citizen cards that will get you bonus actions.  Attack towns and steal the goods you need, or develop your own resources.  

We have played this several times with 3 and once with 2 so far.  Seems to work well in either case.  There are a few rules questions that needed forum to resolve. Art is gorgeous.  Component quality is really good, except for the tendency of the cards to chip on the edges.  Sleeves recommended.  Overall, a current favorite.

First edition. Complete. Cards are sleeved and in deck boxes. No dents or dings.

I was keeping an eye on this one as I love the art and theme... also any game with deckbuilding as a mechanic instead of the core of the game interests me.  While the rules readthrough had me thinking this would be a cross between St. Petersburg and Airlines Europe I didn't really get a feel of those in play.  Partly this is due to large downtime as people build their decks of cards.  Certainly a lot of ways to win here... though at the end I think a smart diversification of goods strategy will get you the win regardless of how you get there.  A pretty good Euro but a few too many "moving parts" for my taste.

In addition to the lushly cute art, this game has a number of good things going on. The first play seemed to last forever, due to a fumbling first round of the game, but with summarized rules, I think this game would go quickly enough. I certainly want to play it more.

Beautiful components and art.  Top notch production.

Game play was pretty good with 3 people, seems like 4 would be better.  

I was teaching and knew the rules, but the other two were struggling to learn and get the hang of it.

We'll play again, and had some really cool stuff going on, but just didn't blow us away.

Surprisingly good game.  Only play so far was 2p and it seems as if it will work much better in a 3/4 setting, but either way exceeded my expectations.  Potentially has a runaway leader issue, but confirmation awaits.

RATING: 7
Rating this one a little lower than the original.  In some ways, playing this one is more difficult than the original.  The dirty words are certainly fun with the right group...but it seemed like there were fewer avenues to link multiple words.  It would probably be better to mix the old and new decks, but I'm not sure I will.

1st play: It's enough like Codenames that I feel I can fairly judge it after one play.  It has the same thinky, clue giving aspect, but the words are a bit giggle inducing.  The problem is that there are only so many words to describe sex or anatomy, so there'a lot of word and clue overlap.  I actually think these words would work better intermixed with all the regular words as just a more comprehensive set.  Still, funny with the right group.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Everything that goes for the original version also goes for this adult  english-only version. I don't think it is offensive, at least for my standards, but I understand that this is a tremendously relative situation. For those interested there are reviews on the internet that provide a good notion about the content. The only "problem" with this version is that it may not be palatable to everybody and therefore it won't be played as much.

RATING: 7
Giving the same rating as Codenames. The 'adult' cards don't bother me one way or the other. I found the game was easier towards the front (easier to find words that tied a bunch of random words together) but harder to the end (some combinations seemed unlikely at best) than average codenames.

Essentially, this is Codenames for adults. And while the theme/box-art is reminiscent of Cards Against Humanity... it's not as vulgar or mindlessly silly. This version is still a solid game that provides some interesting decisions and high replayability. 

That being said, I don't think this version is as good as the original. For one, this game lacks broad appeal. But mechanically, many of the cards are euphemisms for the same thing. So while that does make this game more difficult to play... it also makes it slightly one-dimension.

These phrases in this game are not as taboo as everyone thinks. There are approximately 12 words that are overtly offensive. Most of the words are not. This expansion can be merged with original codenames to add variety. If you are playing with people that would prefer not have to have the risky language then just remove those 12 or so cards.

MIL purchased this for us after we enjoyed playing Codenames with her. She wanted us to have our own copy. She brought this game to our destination wedding and once we laid out the cards on the table, she finally realized she bought the naughty version instead of the original she thought she was buying.

RATING: 6
Surprisingly more difficult than it's predecessor, but if the juvenile/puerile spin doesn't bother you, it's very fun. 

My rating has decreased since playing the game more - although you get a few cheap laughs every time you play (which I do find fun), every word on the table being a double-entendres actually slows the pace of the game down significantly for a start, and results in people opting for "safer" one/two answer clues much more frequently. So, despite us having a laugh at the cards initially, we almost always select regular Codenames - with its better assortment of word cards. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
It's fun for a laugh. Got this as as gift, and though I can't ever see myself use it instead of the default Codenames for more than one round, the "naughty" (sadly they're really not, just a few of them) cards do make for some extra jokes. Not bad if you're going to use Codenames as a drinking game, I suppose.

I have a buddy who buys the "naughty" version of every party game. I can honestly say this is the only one I have ever truly appreciated. Really, it's just Codenames again. If you, like many people, wanted a Codenames expansion this works just fine. The words themselves are mostly pretty PG-13 anyway - this is not going for "offensive" in the way CAH is.

More of the same from an already great game, but now you need to navigate the tricky territory of innuendo. Did he mean what I *think* he meant by that? Is this something in Urban Dictionary I haven't seen before?

Code Names is one of my favorite party games. Deep Undercover is my favorite version.  Not even just for the words, the neutrals have more personality in this one as well.  I carry about half the words from vanilla Codenames in my Deep Undercover box.

I will play this over Cards Against Humanity given the choice every time.

Admittedly, this was my first introduction to Codenames. I thought it was a funny and engaging game. We played with 4 players, but I believe it would be a much better experience with at least 6-8. I can see this being the case for any version of the game. I'm hoping to try the regular and pictures versions at some point.

This is just Codenames with dirty words. It suffers from all the same flaws that the original does AND it can't be played around your family. I'm sure the game was trying to cash in on the Cards Against Humanity craze, but it fails to capture that shock humor. Sure, you may get a chuckle here or there out of trying to find a clue that fits Gigolo, Diarrhea, and Jugs together, but the audience you can play this with is much more limited that the original's already inconsistent (in my opinion) niche. No one wants their grandma to guess the codewords "Vibrator" and "Crabs" and if you're playing with younger people for the shock value, you may as well break out the much more entertaining CAH.

KEEP THE CLEAN CARDS and THROW OUT THE PORNO CARDS AND IT WORKS!

If, like me, you are a mature adult who doesn’t find much of CAH particularly funny, or thinks the idea of playing pornographic codenames an act of poor and immature taste then FEAR NOT, there are a lot of cards in here which innocently will sit in your base game.

I didn’t do an actual count but I estimate that nearly a half of these cards can be included in with the base game without concern even if you were playing with your granny: the double-entendre meaning is so lateral as to be meaningless in a normal context.  Then throw the other half of the cards away.  It makes for an expansion that only delivers half the amount of cards, but if you play Codenames as much as we do in our family you will welcome the extra cards and the variety they bring and it still offers value for money on that basis.

I prefer the orginal Codenames to this version. To me it feels like this game is trying to be sensational simply for shock value. Codenames is such a solid game as is, if given the choice I would always vote for the original to hit the table.

RATING: 6
I have not played this as a stand-alone game and have no intention of doing so. I bought this and took some of the cards from it to add to normal Codenames as an expansion. It might not sound like it would work, but I think it's fine if you leave out the overtly crass cards. There are actually more words common to both sets than I had realized. I also like the fact that it comes with 5 blank cards to make your own words.

Now that Duet has been released, with additional word cards, this seems less necessary to own. I have docked it a point for that reason. It could still be a funny time when having a few drinks, though.

More of the same certainly isn't a bad proposition when we talk about Codenames. The new cards don't necessarily make the game any more raunchy than the original, but the words do feel a little more limited in terms of breadth and variety so if it's just one or the other, the original wins hands down.

RATING: 7
Codenames might honestly just be the best party game, period. This game is chock-full of creativity, tension, teamwork, comebacks, laughter, and excitement. It's extremely easy to grasp, plays up to 8 or even more very well, rewards good players while simultaneously allowing weaker players to catch up, and is about as far from "solvable" as could be. The sheer variety of combinations and the ways the clues can be given is simply stunning. I want to play it right now.

This version adds more cards to Codenames, which can only be a good thing. Yet in spite of the parental advisory and scary black box, this as far more "middle school" and far less "adult", Most of the words are just slang words for anatomy. This does the game no favors. The beauty of the original was to have words that mean a lot of different things in different contexts that people can take all different ways. Limiting this to only a subset of language that CAN mean something dirty just makes the game not as open. You really don't need this if you have the base game, but the game is still the same at its heart so it's hard for me to rate it too harshly.

Regardless of the more (less?) mature themes, this implementation suffers quite a bit due to the slang offering fewer ways to reimagine associations due to specificity. Oh, and there are an uncomfortable number of scatological terms in the pool...and this is coming from gay furry trash.

Being the gay furry trash I am, I would be interested in making more custom cards for this, though. Follow through with your shameless cash-in, CGE!

Initial Rating: N/A

I love Codenames, so when I heard there was a new edition of the game (Codenames: Deep Undercover) I tried to buy it right away. Sadly, this edition is only sold at Target, a place I have no way to access :cry:.

I’m deeply disturbed as well as very sad by this new trend. It seems more and more publishers are creating exclusive games only a handful of privileged people can buy. To me, this is criminal. I want to buy those games and I have the money to buy them, so, me not being able to buy them feels very bad.

Initial Rating: 8.0 (November 2016)

Codenames was my game of the year on 2015 so I was very keen to try the Deep Undercover edition. I’m very bummed I only can buy it at Target, it was an expensive buy for me, but well worth it.

It is the same game with the same rules but now with naughty words. I wasn’t sure if the game was going to work with us, but it did. We had so much fun playing it, we played it like ten times in a row. It isn’t a vulgar game like Cards Against Humanity, it remains the same intelligent word game, but with lots of innuendo. It is a blast to play with the correct game group.

The setup phase takes longer now. I understand a lot of English vocabulary, but we had to google many words I didn’t know the naughty meaning. I’m learning the slang significance now :D. 

This edition of the game is harder because many of the words are synonyms or have strong correlations between themselves. 

For a moment, I thought I was going to mix the sets, but no, I will keep them separate. I will choose which set to play based on the audience. 

For an expanded opinion on the game you can read my comment on the Codenames entry as it is more of the same (which is great on my book).

Bottom line, Codenames: Deep Undercover is a very good party game, I’m giving both versions of the game the same rating. I love it and I will never turn down a game. It is definitively a keeper in my game collection.

After more plays, I must concede that the game IS vulgar. Perhaps I didn’t see all the cards at the beginning or playing with different game groups gave me a different perspective. I also noticed that Vlaada Chvátil´s name is no longer in the box, I’m not sure what is the meaning of this.

My enjoyment of the game has diminished a lot, I prefer to play the original game but I will keep this game in my game collection. Still, I’m downgrading its rating because the initial novelty has passed.

We found it difficult to connect more than two words at the most and even that was difficult. There are too many words within the same area.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Fun, light party word-association game. Rules are easy to teach to even a complete non-gamer and the game moves at a good clip. Biggest problem is that the Spy Master role can be a LITTLE AP prone, especially if you play with already AP-prone players. If your Spy Master is dragging a bit, you can always use a timer, though. Also worth noting that the "Deep Cover" edition suffers from the same issue--not problem, per se--as Cards Against Humanity in that it simply doesn't work for all groups. While not as "extreme" as CAH, it has enough of that that is will simply make some people uncomfortable.

Still codenames, but too difficult to give clues since most of the words are similar.

RATING: 7
I was surprised how much fun we had playing this one, since I expected to not enjoy it much.  Definitely a game to play only with a certain group.  I also think that this would likely work best when played purely with the Deep Undercover cards; I wouldn't mix these cards with the regular Codenames cards.

Great idea on paper, but when all of the keywords have adult themes, there's only so many clue words you can give. Since the keywords are already all similarly themed, whatever clue you give will be applicable to a lot of whatever is on the board, making this version of Codenames less versatile and a bit stale. Doubt I would ever want to play this over regular Codenames.

I can't decide which I like better: all of the jokes and laughs that come with flipping over the grid or the really clever non-dirty clues that usually end up connecting multiple words. Especially good when combined with alcohol, this game can leave you wondering things like "is smegma actually a good thing?" or "but does sausage or pussy taste better?"

The biggest drawback to this game is that you can occasionally have grids with very, very similar words. So I'd recommend actually combining this and regular Codenames and just filtering out the dirty ones if you go to play with people that don't appreciate the obvious innuendos.

Bought this after playing the original Codenames. I found the game only so-so. The "dirty" clues aren't as offensive as something like Cards Against Humanity.

The game adds a whole bunch of innuendos to the game, kind of making it really difficult to not relate the ones to the base if you mix and match. If playing only this standalone then it may be difficult to seperate everything without being too graphic either.

(After 3 Plays) 10/12/16: As my friends are all adults, I don't mind bringing this one out. More Codenames is never a bad thing. The only reason this one is lower than regular codenames is the fact that the cards all seem to be too similarly themed. It's hard to give clues when so many cards relate too it. A good solution may be to mix this with regular Codenames. Only problem there is then breaking it out with the family.

My wife bought this game for us for Christmas and while we found the word list worth a chortle or two, we never really expected to play it more than once or twice. The 2 player rules are entertaining for a play or two, but unless you're part of a kinky swinger club, you probably don't have a large enough group to play by the full rules.

Codenames Duet changes everything! Deep Undercover + Duet may be the best sexually charged couples card game of all time.

One of the criticisms of Undercover was that the words didn't have enough double meanings to really work for Codenames, but when it's just between two people who know each other really well, you'll find yourself giving "You had to be there" clues that will leave you smiling.

A lot of the silent pondering from the original also gets replaced by fun chatter as the person trying to figure out the clues reveals all the raunchy/perverted/kinky ways he/she is connecting your clue to the words on the table. With the default set of Codenames words, you might be annoyed with your partner's lack of geographic knowledge, but when he's explaining why he thinks "Stiletto", "Nurse" and "Seed" are the best answers for 'grapes: 3', you'll both be thinking about last Tuesday ;)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
A fair number of words are usable in the base game but I'd recommend heavy curation.  Now that Duet can be used to extend the base game, and some of the better words from undercover are in that, I've downgraded the rating.  Still, it's Codenames so not _bad_.

I wasn't offended at all by this version of the game, but I found it to be very hard to come up with clues.

Played this version at friend's house.  The adult theme was a nice change from the base game.  Here is what I said about the original:

Man, I love this game!  It has been a hit with friends who have no experience gaming as well as those who are BGG-heads.  It's quick, makes you think, and offers an extraordinary value.  I take this with me to every party I go to and it is always a hit.  Sorry Dixit...

RATING: 6
Less "adult version" of codenames and more like "difficult version" of CN.  The themes are too narrow to be able to chain words together much at all.  For something related to alcohol we had 7 cards on the board.  I think it ended up being 3 for our team, 3 for theirs, and the assassin.  

It just wasn't as fun as you would have expected.

9/10/17.  Played twice.  I don't particularly like bad mouthing games, but "Deep Undercover" is worth bad mouthing.  It's a gimmick at best, and makes for a noticeably worse game than the vanilla version.  Most of the entertainment of this version comes from snickering at some of the cards, and not the actual gameplay.  The "range" of words / cards is much narrower, and makes it rather challenging for the clue giver (and clue guessers).  I'd rather not play this version again.  Just get the vanilla version: it's vastly superior.

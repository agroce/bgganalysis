RATING: N/A
Based on the rules I don't think I'll like this game.  It has a drafting mechanic where there are not enough cards to really get a feel for those cards.  You then play all of the cards you drafted except one.  The cards don't really interact, so the choice is minimal.  Feels like you're changing a light bulb in the dark.

RATING: 7.5
Such a clean design - it is super-easy to explain and yet it feels like a substantial event. This is simple card-drafting (7 Wonders style) with a series of score tracks which players must manipulate through clever card-play. The artwork is tremendous and the variant rules ensure a lot of replay value.

RATING: 5
Everything in Medieval Academy screams that it is a family game. Coulour palette is very rich and saturated which is in line with the cartoony and childish art. During a game players' choices are rather limited and without greater significance.  Yes, you can ponder a move for a quite a long time but I dare to say that it does not matter much since on average every player gets to advance the same number of steps. Players only get to choose the timing and the track.

This is has two sides. On the other hand, games are light and tight, play fast and give you a sensation of making important decisions. The game also gives you a good lesson in drafting mechanics, how to time your moves correctly and how to calculate the relative value of a move (i.e. swing in points). Moreover, you have to choose the fights you want to win but you cannot concentrate too much on one thing. On the other hand, once everyone knows this the game becomes a frustrating tugwar where you just counter each other's moves if you were lucky enough to draft the right cards. The "important decisions" are really not that important because you can expect the others to counter them. The whole game boils down to a couple of decisive moments over which you have very limited control.

Not a bad game. Just uninspiring and not very rewarding.

RATING: N/A
An interesting, rather unique game which consists of a modular board where each module repressents a score track that grants specific in game powers and actions that trigger at different rounds throughout the game. The modules have a basic and advanced side so there is plenty of difficulty level scalability and replayability. The theme feels like a cross between Harry Potter and Pixar as you are in a "Medieval Academy" and the modules repressent different classes you are taking such as Chivalry and Dragon Slaying etc. Definitely a keeper as it plays fast and doesn't overstay its welcome for what it is.

Excellent filler.  I'm inclined to agree with someone who said it is basically between Sushi Go and 7 Wonders.  Very quick to set up and tear down.  More or less a bluffing game that does not over stay its welcome.  For $10 from BN's bargain bin, I got my money's worth, though I think it's original retail of $40 is a bit ridiculous.

RATING: 4
In the card draw, if you get only one good card, the player passing the cards to you first gets two, the following player three, and so on, you're guaranteed to succeed. Otherwise, the game hasn’t many meaningful decisions.

Base game is fine but I have some reserves about the variants.

Another 3 players game labeled for 2 while it shouldn't be.

More a game to play with your 8-12 children, luckily I have people of that target audience at home, or to introduce drafting to newcomers.

Would I buy it again? probably not. Do I regret may purchase? Not really.

RATING: 8
An enjoyable game that is quite simple to explain and play, that is essentially on a par with most popular card games in terms of complexity and, yes, some luck.  This might serve as an excellent gateway game to introduce non-gamers to card drafting, the timing of cards plays, tie break advantages going to the last player to occupy a spot, end of round scoring, etc.  It seemed to play well with five when we played it.

A really cool card drafting game with various score boards that represent different aspects of a knight's training, and you're vying for position on each and using the cards to place your discs. The different boards have different rules and score during different phases, and there are a number of variants you can add in from the box to create a meatier experience. Complexity level here is somewhere between Sushi Go! and 7 Wonders (with its expansions), not difficult to teach but thinky enough to stay fun for awhile. Piero knocks it out of the park with the art here, as usual.

RATING: 5.9
Owned, contained in [boardgame=181327][/boardgame]. Rating and comment shared with that:

Initial rating, based on playing the basic game once as a 2-player game. 
There's more of a challenge here (through very tactical play) than might seem obvious from reading the rules, though it's very much still a gateway game in which luck plays an important part. The many variant rules mean you basically get a whole bunch of slightly different gameplay experiences in the same box; not certain how I feel about that - I'm thinking I probably won't ever get to try every combination, and so I wish they'd provided more guidance on where the best gameplay is to be found.

Rules could've been spelled out more clearly; for example, when do you shuffle the deck (when it runs out, or after each round? Makes a lot of difference for the distribution of cards (official answer is: each round)).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
One of the simplest games I've ever played, and yet, there's something about that drafting that is unique to this game only. The way the different boards give different benefits to different players makes it much more difficult to choose which cards to pass to your neighbor. Great game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.2
I think this card-drafter could sack Biblios for me. Although Biblios has the heavier artwork, it is Medieval Academy which, despite the light-hearted cartoonish illustrations, has more interesting combinations of options to consider. The boxes are about the same size, but I think there's more game packed into Medieval Academy.

We played a 5 player game of this, first game for all of us. Game was very easy to teach. There are many different strategies you can go for I the game, which I like a lot. Don (who won) went mostly for the dragon board, which gives big points at the end of the game. I tried to just not end up in last place in the negative boards and sneakily get points here and there when I could. Another game right in my sweet spot. I love games where I can get non-gamers up and running in 2-3 minutes but yet the game has enough meat to it that my group will also play it. Glad I picked this up.

Initial Impressions:
----------------------
A neat card drafting game.  After the 1st round, I was kind of like "Thats it???", but the game gets much more interesting in later rounds.  There were many tough choices during the drafting, but also when only playing 4 out of the 5 cards.  This one can be a bit random, as you might just never see cards you really need, I found it a ton of fun to play tactical and try to survive the various tracks!  The artwork is also really cool on this one.  One I hope to get many more plays out of.  Also looking forward to trying the many different combinations in which the game can be played!

For a gateway I'd prolly suggest this over 7 Wonders, it's lighter but does a good job of distilling the essence of a drafting game, like what Splendor does for economy/engine building.  Then if you want a heavier option, 7 Wonders is always there, or Trains, or Bloodrage, or A Few Acres of Snow.........

This game is fine as a light activity with some thought and pleasant mechanisms. I don't think I'd reach for this over stronger options though. I'd much rather play a more social game in this time slot - such as Skull, Cockroach Poker, or World Championship Russian Roulette - or I'd rather play Super Mario Level Up or Sakura (Knizia) if I'm looking for something that's strategic yet chaotic in the filler category.

Another Tom Vasel's poster child recommendation infomercial, one reason I only watch his reviews as a last resort. Learned the hard way not to buy anything on Dice Towers recommendations. I just get the feeling minimum play, review, onto the next to keep up the cash flow reviews, an assembly line review. Worst, no revisits after more plays. One particular game that was wax poetic over turned out to have a serious flaw that broke the game, if you watch his dated review you could make a bad buy. I only caught it because the price had gone into the dumper and I wonder why.

That said...

This isn't a bad game, a very light draft card game, placement game, way over priced, it belongs in the $15-$20 range. Can't imagine a 2 player game. It's one of those games you feel bad about not liking, small publisher, it isn't bad,  but, it's too simple for me. If you can get it cheap under $15, it's worth that and a try, for 3-4 players only. 

Personally I would go with something like Notre Dame over this.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.2
This is another standard card drafting game (closest to Fairy Tale or 7 Wonders). The players are then deciding which cards to keep and then play to advance their tokens on 7 different boards. There are two twists - first, not every board scores every round. Secondly, one of the boards lets those in the lead make a final move after cards are played.

I found it very easy to learn and teach. While it definitely takes longer than the advertised 30 min, it's pretty fast to play. There are a number of variants you can swap in to keep it interesting.

Not an amazing game, but a perfectly fine diversion I would happily play again.

To me, it is the perfect "next step" game for people who enjoy Sushi Go, but want a little bit more challenge in their game. It's basically drafting, but then you need to make actual decisions with the cards you had drafted, rather than just simply scoring them. It basically eliminated Greed from the library for me as they scratch the same itch, yet Medieval Academy does it so much more elegantly.

RATING: 5
A simple drafting game with some small room for bluffing how strong your hand is. The draft is brief and you are simply trying to compete on several tracks in a game of chicken. You want to put enough to a track but not too much where the benefit doesn't outweigh the cards spent. Some tracks are more valuable than others to mix up the general strategy.

Medieval Academy is a light-medium drafting game played over 6 rounds.  Players are squires competing with each other to obtain knighthood by advancing along 7 different tracks such as gallantry, jousting, charity, king's service, questing, etc.  Players are dealt 5 cards each round and begin a drafting/passing process until they end up with a new 5 card hand.  These cards are then played in turn to advance players along one of the aforementioned tracks.

Being ahead in the tracks award different bonuses.  Some give points , some avoid getting penalties; while some are scored every round and some are scored at the end of the last.  Players may try different strategies to go for the big scoring tracks at the mid or end game or try to score every turn.  Of course, the luck of the card draw and what your opponents pass to you will affect what you may or may not be able to accomplish.

The gameplay is smooth and relatively short, and the rules are easy to grasp.  It is on the lighter side and has a moderate amount of luck in it.  Overall it is a nice looking and fun game.  Recommended as a filler or a family game.

Great light weight drafting game that's very easy to get into!

The only nuisance are the specialised tokens. While they might be cool in theory, they are quite fiddly because you have to search for very specific tokens. I would have much preferred if they were double-sided, so you didn't have to turn them over all the time when searching for a token. We've actually used a pen and paper to keep score and that is much simpler.

This game deserves a lot of attention. I picked it up in Hall 4 in Essen, and wasn't expecting a lot. No new mechanics, but it flows perfectly well. The game is about two things: Card drafting and getting points (and steal points from others). Very clear to every body. And every one can play it. It has something that is missing in a lot of recent games: Excitement! Great game.

"That's it?" is my response to this game. 

It's light, it's familiar (I feel as if I have played games that this game borrows from), and it doesn't seem to offer something new. I just don't understand how on earth this has an average rating of 7.2. So many better light games out there. Why bother with this one?

So uninspiring is this game that I don't even care to make an argument against it. Dispassionate. :)

Decent, light drafting game. There's a bit of tension in what cards to keep, and a bit of tension in how to order your card plays. And the different scoring on the different boards provides most of the interest. Having different rules for the back of each board is a nice twist, although not all of the board variants are all that interesting.

Components: good boards and ok cards
Complex: really easy to teach and learn
Weight: light
Players: 4
Length: 30 mins
Opinion: fast and fun game with the appropriate group, using the draft system well know from 7 Wonders, you try to promote from squire to knight on various skills (like gallantry, tournaments, education...)
The game is easy to learn and you can start playing in less than 10 mins, the pace is also fast, after an initial draft with 5 cards (from which you will play only 4) you just play a card on your turn, advance on the appropriate board and so on. You have several scorings depending on the round (the game lasts for 6 rounds).
In a nutshell, you have some nice decisions without burning your grey cells but interesting enough to play it sometimes, with the appropriate group (should I go for gallantry and take advance of the bonus or prepare myself for the end scoring of the dragon quest, but I have middle scorings in the jousts, tournaments or education)
So far I liked the game and would play it sometimes if I have not so much time and with the appropriate group (I insists on the later as makes the game really fun)

RATING: 6
Played for the first time, 2 players.  It was fun, but it felt very luck driven with only 5 cards to draft from, even with 2 players.  With more players you'd see fewer repeats and I feel it would be even more luck based.  I'd love to play with drafting 7 or 8 cards and then playing 5 of them...

This game was fun but was a little underwhelming for all the hype. I'm not sure there was much more depth to this game compared to something like Sushi Go! yet this was probably twice the length. I definitely want to play it again and dive into some of the variants in hopes of adding a little more to the game. Compared to the basic game I have to agree, although grudgingly, that Treasure Hunter is probably a better choice if you're looking for a medium weight drafting game. We'll see if the variants change my opinion on that. I still had fun playing it though.

Very straight game where the only mechanic is drafting. It's fast and as such it's an ok game, but there really isn't anything to it. 

Choose the best card, take the next batch of cards, take the best card and so on. Then make use of all your cards and get points or try to avoid losing points (pretty much the same thing).

Ok, for a small and fast game, but nothing more than that.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (August 2015)

Medieval Academy is a fun drafting and majorities game but I’m not sure if it has the depth to capture my attention for more than a couple of games.

The rules are very easy, you can explain them under 8 minutes, and the game flows quickly, you can finish the game under 40 minutes with fast players. The art is pretty good.

Its main mechanism is drafting (I love it) so you will draft over 6 rounds and then see who won. Best with 4 players, not sure about 2 players. It has some interesting decisions to be made, but most of he time we drafted rather quickly and without second thought.

I feel the game has a low replay value and I was ready to sell my copy of the game when the friend who explained it to me said there are alternate/variant ways to play it right from the box, so I will at least try them before getting rid of it.

I’m undecided about the luck factor, some of our plays have been decided by 5 point cards that (obviously) weren’t passed, however as the game is short and light, I don’t mind as much.

Bottom line, Medieval Academy is a light drafting game, perfect for the family. I’m still undecided if I should keep it, it is on the limit of what I allow to remain in my game collection. I want to play again soon to verify this point. My SO liked the game so perhaps I will keep it after all.

This is a light, relatively quick game for multi-players. As with most pick and pass drafting games, there is very little downtime, but each pass of the cards is only as fast as the slowest player.

I prefer drafting games in which the cards are drafted into a hand that is then played in any order - mitigating the randomness of the order of acquisition - so this game fits the bill.

Deciding which cards to keep does require a little thinking, but not too much, and the order and selection of which cards to score (not all in the hand are played) requires a little more. As long as everyone is playing the game at the appropriate lightness for what it is, it should be fun. However, someone prone to AP or a min-maxing card counter could drag it down.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Great card drafting game.  For me, this has replaced 7 Wonders for player counts of 4+.  You draft cards to compete for points in six competitions.  You only play 4 of your five cards drafted.  The order you play matters.  You man not want to tip your hand to soon, letting your opponents know which competitions you intend to master.  The game is quick, strategic, and pleasantly satisfying.

A condensed game of multiple majorities battled out at the same time with card drafting as the central mechanism. After drafting the hand, playing the cards happens almost on auto pilot. Repeat six times, most VPs win.
The authors must have worried about repetitious gameplay themselves as they put lots of alternative scenarios into the box. Ok as a quick filler for 4 or 5 players but nothing to discover beyond a single play - which actually is six plays at once as each round plays out exactly the same as the round before.

RATING: 4
This is thus far maybe the most disappointing of Tom Vasel's recommendations. The only redeeming thing about the game that I could see was the fact that there was variants to make sure that the mediocre design wasn't totally stagnant. 

Imhotep in a way reminded me of Medieval Academy; only Imhotep doesn't cloud the simple mechanisms with drafting silliness. Aside from that my thoughts are: 

1. Autoplay: For real, this game can play itself almost all the time. If you read the rules on the 2 player easy game it literally shows you how to play on Autoplay. Hyperbolically I recommend anyone with my enthusiasm level stuck in a game of this to read those rules and thus avoid any direct contact.

2. Limited design: The cards you are drafting have objectively better advantages. As in I have a 3 and a 4 pink cards; 4 pink is better. Uggghhhhh.

3. Cheap. I just feel empty and used after a game of this. The whole thing looks cheap (and I'm a fan of Piero's work in Ghost Stories), feels cheap (just play it and tell me I'm wrong), and plays cheap. It's like the toxic runoff of a company with too many resources and not enough ideas.

I think the rule book for this game is unfortunately poorly written and that lends itself to several ambiguous scoring questions.  Once you get the hang of it though, having perused BGG threads, you'll find a fun drafting game with a board game component.  Players seem to universally agree that the little round markers are too fiddly and that there should have been perhaps a different way of doing this aspect of the scoring.  Really though, the game is quite fun and the art has a cartoony charm about it.

This is a good mix of a traditional card game with modern gaming mechanics mixed in. It's not an epic game. But it's not light weight either. It usually runs about 30 minutes if you keep it moving along and the tension builds as you approach the later hands and the somewhat dramatic conclusion. It works for me and my family. 

My only gripe, and it's a minor one, the font in the rule book is small and italicized, so it's not the easiest to read, but I manage.

In Medieval Academy, a "family+" game, each player takes the role of a squire who wants to outdo the others in the different training categories to score Chivalry Points. To achieve this goal, during the six turns of the game, the players must wisely draft the cards that are the most useful to them and play them at the right time to move their discs up the training tracks.

At the end of turn VI, the squire who has the most Chivalry Points wins the game and is knighted by King Arthur!

FIRST IMPRESSION:

This is a pretty light drafting game, but the choices of which cards to draft to move along the 7 different paths can make for some challenge. Easy to teach, easy to learn, easy to play - see this as a solid family game or a filler once people know how to play. The randomness of the card draw can be irritating (you only use about 1/3-1/2 the deck of cards each round and you shuffle everything back in after each round).

Great card drafting game, simpler than, yet similar to, 7 Wonders drafting/set collection, but with interesting influence tracks and unique scoring per track.  And great for families and children.

[b]Medieval Academy[/b] was sold via auction 11/5/15.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (6):[/COLOR]

[i]Completely replaced by Sushi Go Party which is easy to teach and just more fun to play. I didn't like having to manage all the different chits for such a simple game, and while it may not seem like much to gamers this prevented Medieval Academy from being a game I'd play with my non gaming family and friends. If you're looking for a light, quick drafting game that you can break out over the holidays look no further than Sushi Go Party.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]- Quick drafting game (plays in a 1/2 hour).
- Great gateway into drafting games, much better than Sushi Go (and in my opinion almost as easy to teach).
- Best "new to me" drafting mechanic: as you draft cards you do not reveal them right away, instead starting with the first player each person plays one card and advances on the chosen track. This adds a fun card play and possible bluffing element to the game play.
- The "advanced" side of the jousting knights adds a fun tug of war element to the game.
- A variety of boards that all score a bit differently (although all but 1 provide either + or - vp's).[/i]

I love the Fairy Tale draft mechanism, and turning the scoring from a personal tableau into a multiple-race game, where one must trade off between keeping/playing cards over long-term races and short term races, is a winner for me. It's simple to teach, simple to play, but comes in maybe a touch longer than it needs to (playing 6 hands instead of Fairy Tale's 4). I like how it comes with variant sides so as to mix and match up each game. It's very light, but a nice easy opener.

This felt like a really neat drafting game. It's simple and straight to the point but also quite tense because everything is so open. Very clever and am looking forward to trying out all the extra bits the game comes with.

Awesome light-medium game.  Simplifies the card-drafting style used in other games, but it also makes it its own little monster.  Drafting a hand of 5 cards (rather than playing them as you draft), and then playing only 4 of those cards out of 5 makes it a great challenge.  The "real deal" 2 player version is NOT my style, but my wife enjoy the "beginner's" 2 player version, where you take turns playing a dummy player (we call it a "computer player").  It's similar to the computer player you'd play in 7 Wonder, but it's not a bad 2 player, great at 3-4.  Have yet to try with 5.

Was pretty unimpressed by this, and I generally love drafting games. But when you draft from only five cards, you don't have a ton of choices, and at higher player counts you basically never see the same hand again anyhow. Beyond that, because much of the game is about advancing on the right track at the right times, there is a good chunk of luck on what cards emerge in what players hands that shape the outcome. If I want a bit of a lighter drafting game Sushi Go/Party does it excellently. 7 Wonders does it supremely well for a bit more complexity. Medieval Academy sits somewhere in the middle complexity wise and yet I feel it has less depth than either and certainly was less interesting or inviting. I'll mostly avoid playing this.

RATING: 7
The base game is solid and accessible -- there isn't a lot going on, but there is more than first appearance.  A 6/10.  But then you an mix in the alternate powers which make the game much more interesting, more tactical, and full of tougher decisions, albeit more complex too.  That bumps it up to a 7/10 for me, and a game I'd especially recommend to gamer families.

update:  I have had several very interesting games, and one that fell summarily flat.  I think the game is better with 4-5 than with 3, as there are more likely to be tactical pressures on your choices rather than obvious strategic pressures.  With just 3, you all too often end up with a wide spread on some boards, making plays obvious and the draft random.  With more players, there are more opportunities to eke out marginal gains -- which keeps my interest even if there is some unfair randomness in the draft,

with 3 or the wrong board combo:  6/10
with 4-5 and the right board combo:  8/10

Another drafting game but this one offers something little different: a board. While there are multiple paths to victory, I am not convinced that they are well balanced. The game is pretty much all about which cards to draft, and even that part doesn't offer much strategies as you only see the hand once (in 4 or 5 player games).

RATING: 5
Played once with 4P. A card drafting game where the simplicity of [thing=133473][/thing] meets the drafting mechanism of [thing=151247][/thing]. Players draft a small hand of cards, then play those cards to move up a variety of tracks. 

While not ground-breaking, the gameplay is decent and I suppose the modular board and variants included help increase the replay value. However, it also lacks the cuteness and compactness of Sushi Go! The high price tag is a bit of a shocker as well. Medieval Academy fits into a specific – and crowded – niche of filler drafting games, but nothing more than that.

#63 on my Top 100 Games of All Time (2015)

This is a newer game that has a drafting mechanism like 7 Wonders, but it's an even lighter game. It's much less fiddly too. It's streamlined, easy to learn, fun to play. Just a great game overall. I like the intrigue of choosing which cards to play/when to play them and deciding which cards you think your opponents kept. Players draft cards of different types to move up on the corresponding track. Each track awards or takes away victory points at certain rounds in the game based upon your position on the track. I think this would be a fabulous gateway game.

A couple of decent ideas in here, but really, this just falls flat. You are way too much at the mercy of the luck of the draw, even in spite of being able to draft cards.

RATING: 6.5
1 play, 4er

This is a nice little drafting game. There are several double-sided boards -- we played the beginner side. These each have a track for players to advance their markers. Rounds start by dealing each player a hand of 5 cards (numbered 1-5 in colors corresponding to the various boards). These are drafted, clockwise or counterclockwise, then 4 are played one by one simultaneously: move your marker ahead 1-5 spaces on the appropriate board. Then, score some of the boards (each score in different rounds) in different ways -- award VP chits, special powers, etc., to the people furthest ahead (or lose VP if furthest back) in the track. After 6(?) rounds, the player with the most VP wins!

The beginner game is pretty basic, but it still works well. Based on a quick glance, though, I think the flip side of the boards would be even better.

A short family strategy game that can be enjoyed by people who also like more involved games, as kind of a super filler. It combines kind of a blind bidding and area majority and drafting. It's kind of a chose and pick because you can't have everything. Some areas give you points if you're in first place, others give you negative points if you are in last place. The trick is to balance everything out.
It doesn't offer anything new at all, but it all works perfectly well and it looks attractive enough.

RATING: 6
A solid drafting game that is probably too complicated for what it offers.

That said, I appreciate the innovative way in which it separates the drafting phase from the playing phase. In other words, just because you claim a card doesn't mean you necessarily have a clear way to play the card. Timing your card play can make the difference between scoring points and feeling the sting of an opponent snaking your claim out from underneath you.

Where the game falls down a bit is in its fiddlyness and graphic design. The "take that" element should be fun, but typically ends up feeling like a frustrating exercise in counting and timing, which in turn makes everything feel much more opaque than it needs to be. Likewise, the design of the scoring cards is especially frustrating. Someone should take another pass at accessing readability. Icons on the cards don't match the corresponding tiles. The colors are dark and often mismatched to the cards. The scrolls that tell you when and how much you score are as tiny as can be (and in roman numerals!). All in all, this is a game that needs further development of its otherwise charming premise.

RATING: 8
Initial plays suggest that this is an awesome light game. Could even be a modern gateway game with its mix of simple rules, tactical gameplay, and fun, vibrant art.

The gameplay is so simple I'm surprised it hasn't been done before. You just draft some cards 7 Wonders-style, then you take turns playing those cards in order to advance your marker along various score tracks. Then you have a scoring phase at the end of each round where you get different bonuses or points depending on where you are on each track. It works great and the game just moves right along.

Going back to the "gateway game" statement, you have decisions that are fairly obvious, but you do have to make some crucial decisions about when to play cards onto certain tracks, and which cards to draft at all. This could possibly be a good gateway to 7 Wonders because a lot of new gamers tend to have trouble with the "trading" in 7W, and the scoring and symbols can be a bit much too keep up with. In Medieval Academy everything is out in the open and you can see exactly where you stand on each track. With the included round order reminder, you don't even really need to open the rulebook after the first play.

The only slight downside is that it's not going to work very well with two players so the box should really say 3-5. There are even two different variants in the rulebook to try to fix the two player game, so that's a big red flag. In addition, moving along the different score tracks can be a little fiddly because you regularly have to pick up a whole stack of pieces and then move your piece from the middle of the stack. Not a huge deal, but the pieces are fairly small so they tend to get dropped pretty easily.

On the whole, a great game for what it is and probably one of the best I've played in all of 2015.

Looks like a game that would've been a must buy when I was first exploring drafting mechanisms. Not sure if it would have anything to wow me at this point though.

On the surface Medieval Academy is a light Euro with cartoony knights of the round art.  However, the gameplay is much deeper than expected.  Medieval Academy would be a great game to introduce to people who like card based games, from Magic to Whist, into the world of Euros.  

In terms of variations, the two advanced boards that made the most sense were the knights, which should always be played on the white bordered side, if for flavor alone, but even more-so for the game play.  The other is the Dragon, which I found far too swingy on the standard side. 

At minimum I want someone I know to own it.

I actually like this game better than 7 Wonders. There is some analysis involved, more reactions to decision made by other players, more options and strategies. Seems to me that lot of people are misguided by fairy-tale...ish illustrations. By default, cards are reshuffled after every round, but gamers may benefit from a variant with predefined amount of cards of each type (7 Wonders style).

Card drafting euro game. Nothing very interesting about it. Pasted on theme.

The artwork is fun, we laughed a lot when we played, drafting is fun, more depth and strategic choices then I first imagined to keep you engaged. If you look at the game and think it looks nice, if you like drafting and if you like strategy with a pinch of chaos, I recommend it. It took about 75min on 5 players first game ("advanced" settings).

A terrible two player game. Each player has to effectively play for two people. It's a four player game and that's that.

RATING: 8
Fun light game of card drafting (by passing hands).  The cards each move a player's token along one of several tracks, and though unfortunately they don't combo, there is just enough variation in value (to different players/at different times) to make the draft interesting. Have more often played the German version (Die Holde Isolde), but with the basic rules it's the exact same game.

Kind of fun, feel like Mr Vassel talked it up.  It has some clever stuff going on, kind of a next step to Sushi Go I guess, but I still prefer the quickness of that one.  This game is a bit fiddly with constantly moving markers around, also feels more luck-of-the-draw based.  Nice for a laid-back lunch break.

RATING: 6
light card-based majority-game, each "area" scoring (bonus or malus) at differently and at different times

[+] cute artwork, the different mechanic/bonus/malus for each base, you never know who is in the lead (can only guess), reset some base after turn 3 to not be stuck behind forever
[-] very luck dependent since you can only move on 4 tracks (out of 7) in any turn, you are not sure to even get a card that plays in your "strategy"

Easily the best drafting game as there are actually meaningful decisions in which cards to keep as well as to play and in which order; instead of just knowing and playing the probabilities of different cards and combinations in other drafting games - and hoping that somebody else does not randomly cancel your cards as in the absolutely dreadful Fairy Tale.

What a great card drafting game. Very family friendly and the art and components are fantastic. The choices you are forced make in this game is what really makes it shine. Gameplay is very simple but the strategy runs very deep for this type of game. There are so many variants and double sided boards to keep the game fresh. Buy this one.

A really nice entry level game.  Fairly tense area majority game with a card draft mechanism.

Interesting choices and fun to play.

A little light for me, but I'd recommend it for families.

RATING: 6.5
First of all, it hasn't much in common with 7 Wonders, besides the initial draft.
It's a simple game, in 5 players plays almost fast and it works, but it has a fundamental problem: no interesting decisions to talk about. Your decisions are limited to the 6 drafts of 5 cards, where you actually decide which 4 cards to keep out of 14, and then which of the 5 chosen cards not to play. The order in which you play cards has also importance, actually, but not that much, just as a tiebeaker. So all in all it's a decent family game that  flows without much thought. Components and art are good quality with a big exception ,the colors of green and blue discs are so similar bordering induced daltonism. Also the symbols on the small boards aren't very appearent but this is not a big deal after a few turns.
I would play it again if nothing else comes out but i will easily skip on this (unless the variations on the theme positively affect the game xperience)

RATING: 7
I like drafting games to some degree. 7 Wonders has been in my collection for a long time and will likely stay for a while. I enjoy the simplicity of a drafting game and really enjoy seeing the progression of ages and specializations of different players. Sushi Go is okay, but I probably won’t buy it, it’s just a little too light for my tastes.

With that in mind, I approached Medieval Academy with some trepidation: would it fall more on the 7 Wonders side of things where there’s enough meat for me, or on the Sushi Go side where there’s not quite enough. It’s definitely on the 7 Wonders side and I hope to play it a bunch more.

Much like the aforementioned games there is a series of rounds where you are dealt a number of cards. You take a card and pass the remaining cards to your left or right. However, unlike 7 Wonders or Sushi Go you don’t play the cards until you have a full hand of five cards. At that point, in turn order you play cards in whatever order you want. That little bit of flexibility makes this different enough from 7 Wonders to warrant keeping and I think I enjoy it just a bit more.

On the other hand, the game is thematically weak when compared to 7 Wonders, which is also considered thematically weak in the board gaming community. In other words, the theme is pasted on. However, considering the quality (good) and length (roughly 30 minutes for 3 players) of the game, I’m okay with that.

RATING: 6
This is a quick and fun card drafting game. I especially like this because it is easier to explain than 7 wonders but feels like there is more to it than sushi go, which makes it a good introductory game to card drafting. The theme is kind of pasted onto the mechanism, but the rules help to integrate the theme to some extent.

RATING: 6.5
Simple drafting game in which you have to juggle your position on several small central boards. Going ahead on certain boards will score you points, but lagging behind on others might lose you points. It's the "trying to be everywhere at once" part that keeps you interested. That, and the ridiculously awesome artwork!

RATING: 7
Fantasy card drafting game advancing player tokens on modular quest and tournament boards to score the most chivalry points. 7 Wonder style draft to select cards that advance your token on a specific board. I like the payoff decisions that come from boards scoring each round, some that score at the end or in later rounds, and a board that causes laggers to lose points. The best part of the game is the timing and strategy of card play based on what tracks the other players are advancing and from your recollection of the card distribution in the draft. This is amplified by players burning their last card--brilliant little twist adds exciting tension. Reminds me of shooting the moon in hearts when you have or know they have a loser, but which suit?

A card drafting game that has several different ways to score. What makes this game for me is that there is player interaction that is enjoyable which is often missing from card drafting games.

2015: Fun game made better by great artwork and being family friendly. Hard-to-find promos drive me nuts but the game itself is nice. Have only played the basic game 2P. The 2P rules were clunky and I'm looking forward to playing with more (and with the advanced rules).

Update 2017: Played again after a several-year absence. I really enjoy the artwork and replayability but my go-to card drafter for this weight is Sushi Go. If I've got more time to enjoy one, I'd prefer to play something like 7 Wonders. Fun for a time but I can't see myself going back to this.

[microbadge=31774] Fun game that I'm happy to play, but new games required that we start getting rid of a game here and there. We played a game of this with Michael and Pablo one game night and both said they liked it. So, we gifted our copy to Michael for his birthday! Looking forward to playing it when we're at his place - and maybe he and Alicia will enjoy playing it together as well.

It seems a simple game, but there are so many shady strategies you can choose from. Drafting games should be like this!

Card drafting and worker placement/resource management as one mechanic. Very clever. Theme feels a little meh, could have had any theme really. I like how every part of the game feels important. The drafting for setting your strategy, the order of placement, to adjust tactically, then the end round scoring which has several different boards to get points (or lose them). This weight of strategy I really enjoy.

Rating based on one play. Would like to play more. I like drafting, but I'm a little turned off by the fact that cards in this game range from 2 to 5, which means some are objectively better than others, and that makes your choices more obvious at times. Apparently there are dozens of variants, so I'd like to try some of those fore sure. Also I prefer the German title ('Die holde Isolde'), because rhyme :p

Lightweight card drafting and simultaneous card play game. Artwork is very good and game components are good quality too. The mechanic of moving player discs on top of one another's is probably the highlight, but that has already been used in quite a number of other games. Gameplay is not very deep and replayability may therefore be low.

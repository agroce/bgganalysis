Thumbs up because the kids like it. I might be inclined to simply get the larger version (read, the REAL version) of this title. It's fun though, and that's what counts.

Have had a lot of fun playing this with both gamers and non-gamers. Even with children, the youngest around 5 years old, the game was a hit. It doesn't feel small, so I'm glad I bought the mini version.

Not taxing stuff at all - just flicking and trying to cross the finish line first. Very basic, and rather fun.

PitchCar Mini offers the same experience as the original in a smaller box. Admittedly the smaller pieces require nimbler hands but it is still something most people can live with. Big plusses are that the game requires much less space (no need for a big dining table) and is easier to transport.

Good fun little dexterity game. Much easier than the full size version to take about and setup.

This has been fun to play with my kids and at a few family gatherings. It gets too crowded and confusing with 8, however. I wouldn't recommend it for more than 4-5.

RATING: 8.5
Dexterity to the max! Fun little flicking game that has lots of flexibility in terms of track layouts. Setup can be a bit difficult-- especially if you're creating a track of your own versus one of the prescribed ones on the game inserts... but that's honestly part of the fun, especially for folks who like to build and create. The game gets better and better with each expansion you add (primarily in flexibility and length of track design), which can be an expensive proposition. Shop around; I was lucky enough to find most of the individual boxes for $20 - 35.

I did debate a lot on full size or mini and am glad I went with mini. With expansions, full size can get huge (we're talking multiple dining room tables huge), so I like that I can use all the mini expansions and still fit it on my 72" x 42" table. My only wish is the mini expansions included a fly-over like the full-size version does, but mini fortunately has some pretty sweet little ramps. 

If you're worried about the weight of the little discs, they are indeed light and tiny, but that's not overly detrimental in my experience. You easily adjust to a variety of flicking tactics.

Positives
- Very simple to explain
- Use the "trash rules" for when one car bumps another off the track-- the struck car takes the starting place of the original that bumped it off!
- Lots of variation in track design possibilities
- Supports up to 8
- Plays fast and gets people up and moving

Negatives
- Expensive due to importing
- Can take time to set up and take down, especially if you start getting creative
- Bad track design can result in some folks getting stuck on parts of the track, wasting turns trying to get out of a bend (or over a long jump) over and over and over

I adore this as a party game. It satisfies my racing and dexterity needs. 

More and more plays have shown me that it's the simplicity I enjoy. I'm not sure I want to be racing on elaborate tracks. So long as you are trying to pass people or feel the heat at your rear it's a fun game. When you are laps ahead it gets boring quick. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Probably PitchCar is better, but I've never played it. You pretty much have to make up your own rules about how to play (we play each round in current race order), but there is definitely skill in flicking those little cars around the track. A good fun game for up to 8.

Great game, lots of fun for all ages. Kids seem to be better than adults at playing this one which is great!

Very good for parties/family get-togethers, small box size makes it perfect for a gamer on the move or for taking on holiday in case of rain/boredom setting in.

I could play pitchcar for hours.  A great dexterity game for large groups.  I can't imagine purchasing this game without the first expansion (which has all the jumps!).  On the other hand I have a tendency to build tracks that are too frustrating for newcomers (ie. too many jumps)  so what do I know :)

Finally a chance to own and play the hard to get Carabande for a decent price! This is a good package because you can easily carry it around and play on a smaller surface... like a standard table!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Pitchcar's biggest problem was that it was a huge heavy box. So making it smaller means (for me) it would be played more often. Obviously if you just keep it set up at home then the bigger set is probably better.

Rating -- Indifferent.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Very good dexterity game. The more competition the better but even a 2 player game can be fun. My only complaint is for poor quality of components. If the track surface is not even (which will happen after some time) the bolid would be go out of the track frequently which is very irritating.

Like Gulo Gulo, it puts three year old kids on a level playing field with adults, while at the same time remaining challenging for everyone.  Fun game. UPDATED: This was the final event in an annual pentathlon of geek event I run and it was a huge hit. My estimation of it went up quite a bit after that.

So much more fun than I anticipated. Played with 5 the first time and it was a blast.   I won the first game though I think my mom gave me the win cause it was my birthday.  And my sister won by a mile in the second game.  Really a genuinely fun time.  In fact, we went to our FLGS a couple days later and I had a hard time finding something to buy cause I couldn't find anything that I thought would match the fun of this one.

Stupid fun! Trying to get the feel for a good flick. Has a lot of the dumb tension of the drinking game "quarters". Maybe race winners could make "rules". I guess I am implying that this game works well when one has had a coupla drinks.

RATING: 7
Tons of dexterity fun!  I've heard many people cry out against this tiny version of the classic game Pitchcar.  People seem to think that the smaller size ruins the feel of the classic game.  Well, I've never played the full-size version of the game, but this one is spectacular fun, and it easily fits on any table, something that I don't think can be said of the big game.  For the portability and the ease of setting up on almost any table, I enjoy this version and feel no real need to get something bigger.

You will find yourself laughing and shouting at many moments during this game.  It's cool how simple the rules are, and how enjoyable the game can be.  Even coming in last place (or not even playing but just being a spectator) you can have a lot of fun cheering for other players and marveling at some of the great shots that players will make.  It can be a bit of a downer when a player gets into a runaway leader position.  I also find that, with a full complement of 8 players, the track can get quite crowded.  Still it's a great simple game that everyone seems to enjoy.

I usually play this game during holidays with people that are not used to complex boardgames. It has just a couple of rules and they can be altered as needed to make the game funnier.
The components are of good quality and the mini version doesn't take too much space (it is the reason why i have preferred this version). On the negative side, sometimes the cars can get stuck or jump when they pass over the joint between the track parts (even if the track is placed on a perfectly flat surface).

Game that is on board, but if you think you like to use many tokens or dices, it's simply not for you.

For some reason, I actually liked the feel of Pitchcar Mini *better* than the original Carabande/Pitchcar. I'm not sure why exactly, but it seemed like the smaller scale and more even production had a little more control. It also seems to play faster. I wouldn't put money on that opinion, but I'm glad to have both Pitchcar games.

Having played regular PitchCar first is likely my problem. There is nothing wrong with Mini as it works well on a smaller scale and my daughter does do well with it. However, as a matter of personal preference because I have the space I've upgraded to regular. If you don't have the space for regular, Mini is a perfect way to get your PitchCar fix.

Fun dexterity game, but not for those who can't fine tune their flicking.  The game is not about power, but about finesse and playing the right shot instead of power flicking and hoping (although that does work at times).

We play a slightly modified version where if you knock someones car off the track, they go back to where you started from, not where they were.  This makes for a little more aggressive game.

A scaled down version of Carabande, probably about a third the size of the original game.  Players race around a track, composed of laminated wooden track pieces, slotted together in jigsaw fashion to construct a circuit.  The cards are wooden disks that slide along the surface of the track, powered by finger flicking!  A fun dexterity game, this version definitely aimed at families with younger gamers.  Adults would probably want to look at the full sized version, as the cars here are very light and easy to send flying off the table.  Still, if you're challenged for space, well worth a look.

The mini version just doesn't compare to the big one.   It's too crowded, people want to spin the track around rather than move their bodies, and it doesn't fit together as nicely.   And, it's hard to aim your shots and make nice long shots.   I can see why they came out with this, because it is so much more portable, but it's also that much less fun.

Pitchcar mini isn't quite as good as pitchcar, but then again, you can fit a much more satisfying track on most tables.  I certainly wouldn't hesitate to pick it up if you have limited table space, or just plain want to save some money.  The biggest downside is the lack of stunt race.

I prefer this one to the full version when playing with my four year old, since the mini is small enough to allow us to rotate the track to take our turns.  He is too short to see the table otherwise, so for Pitchcar we have to lift him up there every turn.  Or let him sit on the table, which is very popular with him but not so popular with mom.

You can't go wrong for the price of this and the mini expansions. Yes it is a little smaller. Actually bigger than I thought it would be. It's really nice due to the fact that you can make some really nice tracks in a small area due to the size. I still prefer the original for when I can actually find the room to set it up, but this is a very nice and cost effective alternative. You won't be disappointed.

RATING: 7
Fun, fun! The group I introduced it to didn't seem so excited as I set up the track, but when we began to play, everyone really enjoyed themselves. On the whole it was quite a hit.

So, my complain is this- Pitchcar Mini is just a little too mini. The rails keep popping off in the turns and it is really hard to flick like you can with the regular game. I understand that space might be an issue, but I think I am going to aim for the regular set.

I'd like to try the full-size version, but this one suits my needs just fine.  I'm surprised at how small and light the box is!

This is a nice dexterity game that my whole family enjoys.  Like many dexterity games Pitchcar Mini tempts one to make the "brilliant" shot but seems to reward fairly conservative control shots.  This aspect can be a bit frustrating for the kids but they always get a kick when their huge shots pay off.

RATING: 3
Had it for over a year and played about 10 times and can conclude definitely not happy with the mini version. The problem with the mini (as others have mentioned) that the seams between the track pieces can cause the tokens to bounce around making the game too random to be fun. 

The problem is you want to line up a perfect shot and send the piece flying around the track, but no can do as inevitably the piece hits a seam and flies off

Wish I had got the larger version

While I think I get some of the comments about the "disappointing cars" I also equally don't understand.

There's a different technique you have to use, and while perhaps I'd like heavier cars I think it's just a matter getting a feel for how much lighter you have to be to get the same effect on the cars. 

Most of our players were getting equal performance to that of the full size version in a matter of a lap or two.

I like this every bit as much as the full scale and it's totally portable!

I bought this game *ahem* for my kids.  Although no one seems too enthused when I pull it out, it doesn't take long for everyone to get in the mood and competitive spirit.

PitchCar Mini is the smaller version of PitchCar. Players have a small wooden disk that they take turns flicking around the assembled track, which can be made as complicated as you like. 

Components are good and the disks can fly surprisingly far with a good flick. Works well at all player counts but better at higher.

This is a great dexterity racing game (that has a similar vibe to playing mini-golf!). We just would prefer to play 'Flick Em Up' or Dungeon Fighter for our dexterity fix.

Admittedly, dexterity games aren't my cup of tea.  For what the game is/was, it was fine.  I just don't find flicking a wooden disk around a board all that fun. 

EDIT - (Crokinole excluded) 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
A nice little bit of fluff and the perfect enthuser for non-gamers (it's a bit too simplistic even to be called a 'gateway', no?). The miniature version means the dexterity mostly goes out of the window, though, which is a shame as the game descends into a free-for-all. A must after a few drinks, though.

Superior to PitchCar due to two factors: smaller foot print takes up less room at little cost to game play (and reduces price!) and bumpers stay in the tracks the whole game.

I don't see what the fuss is about - you flick a disk along a plank of wood. 

I wouldn't pay £25 for that, and certainly not £40 for the full size version.

RATING: 6
Surpisingly little is lost (if anything) by playing this mini-sized version over the original big track layout. Same finger-flickin' process, but with more precision required due to the smaller size and the tighter bunches that occur (which is actually a plus!). Crokinole will always winout in this genre, but this is decent fun for the occasional play if you don't mind standing up and walking around the table for the entire game.

What a great idea for a game. The mini version is a great value. Simply flick your car around the track and win the race. But the expansions add jumps and some lanes can have no railings so watch out. You can also play the friendly way or unfriendly, where you can knock others off. Lots of fun for all.

It didn't make me feel anything. The game itself is a solid dexteritygame, but I didn't get excited about the racing part; no sweaty palms or suspense - nothing.

Okay, so I bought this thinking it would be a fun game to play with my nephew... I'm desperately trying to get him to like something other than The Game of Life. I was totally surprised that I enjoyed this game so much.

It is really just silly fun, flicking little disc shaped cars around the track. I am absolutely terrible at this, but I have fun even when I lose, lose, lose. 

D also loves this... he used to play something similar as a kid with pennies, so it has some sort of nostalgia factor for him.

Definitely a surprise hit.

However, after purchasing a crokinole board, we realized this probably won't hit the table anymore.

I thought I would like this game. Unfortunately, it did nothing for me. I guess I prefer euro type mechanics to dexterity. This is the ultimate 6.0 rating game: I will play... if someone else has set it up and I am waiting for another group to finish a game. and if the other group finishes before I expected, I don't care if I even finish it.

Just sold it for $40 CDN. Going to buy the full-sized version.

I've played this with 2 different gaming groups as well as my pre-teen daughters, and every game generates screaming, laughing, trash-talking, and general, unbridled competition. 

Oddly enough, I haven't had the urge to play this in months. I may have burned out on it. 

Buy this instead of the full-sized version. The rails stay in better, and it's easier to carry.

The straight pieces are not as thick as the corner pieces, so every joint causes a bump that causes the "cars" to go flying off in random directions.  This effectively makes the game nearly unplayable.  It's not as bad as the expansion, but it is very bad.

Easier to set-up and play than the original Carabande is a plus in this games favour.  But offsetting that is the miniature cars that are just a bit on the thin side and harder to flick as a result.

This game makes me very keen to upgrade to a larger house, kitchen and therefore bigger table, so I can try out the full size version. Until then mini will more than do. Will start buying the expansions once the novelty of the base game starts to wear thin.
Edit : bought expansion 2, well worth getting. Hugely popular game to spring on non-gamers. My love for this game has only increased over time, which is rare enough. Also acted as a spur for me to try Carrom, which is superb.

Great, great fun! This dexterity game is played real quick (quicker than I thought, actually) it's easy to get into. It's very visually appealing. It's hard not to want to play again right after playing.  There's always the debate over which one is better: Mini or Regular. I say it just depends on the situation. The fact that I can build almost any track on a normal kitchen table, complete with both expansions, and it all fits into the original Pitchcar Mini box, and its significantly cheaper all sealed the deal for me. If you have a lot of room, and had a little more room in your budget, normal Pitchcar could be for you. But, I have no regrets. I love this version and this game!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fun game, but still requires a quite a bit of space for people to move around the table.  The mini version seems much smaller than the full size version and the cars are very susceptible to an uneven surface.  I have two sets and I find that linking them up gives a lot more course options than just one set.

Fun dexterity racing game.  If you play, people will be drawn to it.

In one game, just after saying that probably the best one could hope for would be a lucky shot that goes halfway around the track, my nephew made a shot that lapped the track and ended right next to where he started.  I'm certain that some laws of physics were broken for a moment.  It just doesn't seem possible.  To this day, I doubt my own veracity.

I get why you would buy the smaller version, the big one takes up quite a bit of space.  But, for me something is lost when you reduce the size of the pieces and narrow the playing field.  This one requires more precision and yields more unexpected results.  I prefer the cleaner, heavier shot, and a better angle on what you are going for.

More fun than it deserves to be; 8 gamers played three races. We started cheering and laughing and sharing commiserations when people succeeded or crashed badly.

By the end of race 2, it was deadly serious and no-one was talking.

That's a pretty good thing for a game involving flicking bits of wood around a track.

Not something I'd play often (by race 3 I was flagging a little in my enthusiasm) and it sucks when you're at the back (overtaking is not easy on the small track), but fun to pull out now and again.

Just like 'kapsle' - the game every boy in Poland used to play 20 years ago, and then some. My favourite dexterity game by far.

Good fun for the whole family.  The two-year-old is able to push his car without holding it down now, the four-year-old is decent at flicking.  I'm not great at it (though better than the kids on average, it's not always true).

RATING: 8
Rated after over 10 tournaments. Mini size makes it quite different compared to the big version, track is rougher* and game is slower, but still very enjoyable. Nevertheless a fun game, you can drink and drive. Needs to have couple of cars in the track to be enjoyable, so use 2 cars per player if having only 2 or 3 players. However, better with more players even though that means that the downtime increases.

Looking forward to play more in the future with Extensions.

*Rougher means, that the components are not that good, the parts of the track are quite different in thickness.

If you're going to make the investment in a Pitchcar set, and you're thinking about getting the Mini game to help save a little bit of money, just put that money away for another month and wait until you have enough to get the full-sized version of the game.  The larger cars allow for better control of your flicking, and the game just looks better when you have the larger set.  The only reason I could think for someone to purchase the Mini set over the standard set is if they simply didn't have the table space.  Even then, though, I might discourage them from getting the Mini set because it's just not as fun or as interesting.

PitchCar Mini is a dexterity game where wooden, puzzle-like pieces are used to construct a race track that looks very similar to a slot car track when finished. But instead of using electrons, players use finger-flicks to send small pucks around the track, a la Carrom.

It is amazing how you can lay this out and a bunch of adult will just devolve into flicking madness and mayhem.

Small track isnt too much of a problem. Although the track is easier to move/knock around during play.

The advantages it has over PitchCar(full size) are :-

Easier to find a table that is level for it.

Its cheaper to buy and does seem to have all the same track pieces as PitchCar (expansions as well)

Its so much lighter to carry to a games meeting.

Played at bgg.con 2006. This was fun and it was very easy to get players to try it out with me. I thought it was great. Until I saw the bigger-sized PitchCar. And then later, I think I saw Carabande. And it was HUGE. That's what I want. Mmmmm. Carabande.

A great dexterity game for all ages (my 6 year old loves it).

My favourite dexterity game, even though I am terrible at it. We chose the mini version so that we could play it on the table, however I hope one day we will have a table big enough for the proper version.

This would be our most wanted game in our wish list. We don't need the big PitchCar game, just the mini version will be good for us and make us very happy. We played PitchCar Mini which Jerry bought from Essen 2015 and it was really fun! Hubby loves playing Carom so he is really good at PitchCar Mini. Hopes to own a copy with all expansions. 

Initially PitchCar fell under my radar as we thought flicking cars around the track seem a bit boring but having tried it, it was actually very fun and I think the guys are better at it. I like it when with the right flick, my car ricochet at a angle to further along the track.

Good loud fun. Especially when most of us take the role of announcer when not our turn.

Lotsa flickin' fun.  But really I think the larger set would be better.  It can be very difficult to keep your car on the smaller tracks of the mini set.  Makes it hard for beginners.  If you think this is your thing, consider the larger version.

Kind of said to get rid of it. But I'll chase its "bigger brother". Technically they the same game, but I believe the big versions will simply be more of an eye catcher in the table. Also better flicking disks and better settled race-track.

Amusing dexterity game for all,  requires some training to get a feel of the gameplay.

The basic game seems rather dull - simply nothing special. But with at least the 1st extension it becomes more fun.

As good as the full sized edition.

The pieces tend to stay on the track more, not suffereing as much from track joint steppage.

They also travel further around the course with a single flick.

Juego de carreras en el cual tu "auto" avanza a medida que le das "chirlitos" con los dedos.

Near perfect game. My only complaint is that downtime can be long since you are waiting for everyone else to go.

It is much like Kingsburg in space with a lot more options. You aren't really penalized by low rolls since each area of the board can use something different. 

I love that the scoring is so small. It makes it really easy to keep track of.

I can see putting a lot of plays on this!

A nice variation on "dice as worker placement' ala Kingsburg.  There was a nice balance of things where high rolls and low rolls could both be good so luck wasn't as big a factor.  Quality of bits is good for a small publisher.

It's like Space Yahtzee, but amazing! I really enjoy everything about this game - it's quality components, the mechanics, and the space theme! The dice mechanics of this game and people "jamming" up the board with their moves is really interesting and fun. All of the detailed components like little plastic bubble colonies really enhance the space theme. The Alien tech cards provide enough flavor and uniqueness to players and provide very fun and dynamic game play.

Good game.  Luck plays a role, but can be mitigated through alien tech purchases.  Lends itself to some "take that" mechanics.  May be hampered by a "kill the leaders" feel.

Kind of split on this one. Sometimes it's really tense and leads to lots of table talk, other times it feels very rote and mechanical. Think it works best as a "warmup" game to be played once at the beginning of a game night; the times we've played it multiple times in one night it starts to feel "samey"

Alien Frontiers is a dice rolling game that I actually enjoyed (a rarity).  I can see this game becoming a favorite for when my group is in the mood for a casual/light strategy game.  Often after a game, I find myself wanting more from the experience.  I haven't decided if this is good or bad.

RATING: 6
A 50:50 mix of things I love in a game and things I hate. I love: worker placement; resource management; clever use of dice. I hate: direct conflict and negative interaction, area (and majority) control, sci-fi themes. Hence not a game for me, but I can see its merits.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Worker placement and area control mesh together nicely in this game that reminds me a little bit of Kingsburg.  The Space theme is presented very well, although the players are left having to create their own story behind the game.  The game designates the dice as your actual spaceships, docking at orbital stations around the moon of an alien planet in a struggle for domination.  I've found it to be somewhat intimidating for new players.  The rules are simple, making it easy to teach, but one player can easily "run away" with the game if the others do not take the appropriate strategic measures to stop them.  This might make it too cat & mousy for some.

1 play / 4 players

LIKE: Many interesting combos, area control that gives powers. Great use of dice.
DISLIKE: Extremely high downtime between turns. Also, there is are kingmaking and trounce the leader issues.
OVERALL: Late game gets vicious as players volley for area control and start stealing from each other. The game is fun, but it needs some adjustments. I would place (in addition to the 6th colony) a set number of turns before the game ends. Otherwise the game could go on and on. Also, I would ban "takebacks" to speed up turns.

RATING: 6
+Nice use of dice as workers.
+Numerous ways to mitigate luck of the dice.
+Seems well balanced (no dominant strategy).
+Enjoyable artistic style.

-Down time can be a problem in 4 player games. DO NOT PLAY WITH 5 (requires expansion, but don't do it)! Players cannot do any planning when it is not their turn, so you are left sitting there doing nothing, and turns take longer because there is no pre-planning.  I will never play this with more than 3 players again.
-Too much "pile on the leader" for my taste.
-Games seem to always end with very close scores (see previous point).  Because scores are low (around 7-9), they are always close, which makes it very easy for the game to end up in a king-making scenario.

Ios Version - Sci-Fi Worker Placement

I'm having a lot of fun with this one. If it wasn't out of print at the moment, I would probably pick up a physical copy. I really dig the retro-future vibe. Gameplay is fast and decisions are easy. You and your opponents will trip over each other, but it always feels like there is something worthwhile to do. I really enjoy this one.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
This is just such a frustrating game experience. This is just a constant game of bash the leader until you get to the point where everyone doesn't want to end the game because they won't win so it becomes a futile game of trying to manipulate other players to put you in a winnable position. Expansions just make this worse with their horrible randomness and wild differences in power. This game just frustrates me so much mostly because my friend has it and it's the groups gateway game so it gets played all the time. There are so many better games!

You can do all of these exciting things with your dice but it's just quicker and easier just to steal stuff from other people, then at its core its an area majority game so the player who was in second place will likely win as leader always gets bashed.

Nothing to do during down time.  Can't plan ahead.  AP when you finally roll the dice at the start of your turn.  Slows near the end.  But it still looks like I could move quicker than Kingdom Builder. "a ton of downtime with AP prone players"

RATING: 6
+ The use of dice is creative and the theme is really wonderfully executed.
- The Raider's Outpost action simply made the game un-fun for us. There needed to be another interesting option for that dice combination that didn't include a spite factor.


Why it's previously-owned:
Ultimately, the game was a little too in-your-face with the direct blocking and especially the (way too easy to activate and gang up on one player) Raiders action.
I traded this away for Brass, and it was replaced in our game group handily by Troyes.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Note: Mix of Alea Iacta Est and (dice) worker placement plus action cards. You collect resource to build either more workers or eventually colonies. There is some take that with the raiders (steal resources or cards). The game is simple and easy to teach, I think, that is why it is so popular. There is downtime because each player plays all his worker dice on his turn. The theme is okay. 

Thoughts: Good game but the options in this game are less interesting for me. You cannot really mitigate your rolled dice.

A fun enough dice roller.  The tech cards push and pull on everything and can be somewhat unbalance (but that's okay).  What I dislike is that the dice rolls are somewhat unmitigated.  If there's something you really want to do and you don't roll the right number or combination then too bad, you can't do it!  It's a good game but there's no mitigation outside of the alien tech cards and those offer very poor control if and when they do.  I would play this again but feel no need to own it or seek it out.

FAVOURITE GAME - this is one of my all-time favourites. It is a worker placement/dice rolling game, where you have to conquer a central moon by building colonies on it. To do this, you have to allocate your ships to perform action of resource gathering, building, trading and so on. The ships are your dice. You roll a number of dice/ships and accordingly you distribute them between the actions. It is a light and not so long space conquest game accesibble for everyone. The trick is that you do not recover your dice at the end of your turn so you are able to block someone else's strategy plans, and as it, the game has a lot of interaction.

RATING: 4
Aesthetically, I like my space games in extremes. I don't mind your games like [thing=39339][/thing] that take themselves seriously, but I'm just as drawn to [thing=142079][/thing] that doesn't take anything seriously. What I can't stand is a game in-between. Alien Frontiers is a bit like this, with it's naming of planets after famous writers and disjointed thematic schema. Looking at, and playing the game, I was repelled by the hokey layout and boxy art. 

Mechanically, there are some interesting things going on, but nothing groundbreaking. Dice Allocation seems great - rolling 1s can be good! - but what tends to happen in a lot of dice allocation games is that in an attempt to balance the numbers, choices become dictated or meaningless. Here, this isn't always the case, but most of the time you can do what you want and are trying to gouge value from the leftovers. 

Dynamically, this causes huge problems. Downtime just destroys this game. You can't plan properly until you've rolled, and you can't roll until your turn. This is intractable, as you need to know where others played to, so you can't play simultaneously. Further, the endgame has no drama as players are pulled back from the brink of victory simply because it's the right play of whomever is still in the game, so winning is mostly being the last man standing ... after several hours of dithering. 

I don't think this game is pointless, but I also don't think it is better than games that most people already have. As one of the first Kickstarter successes, this should have been a standard bearer for the problems of crowdfunded games (poor art, weak development, redundancy).

I'D RATHER WE PLAYED: [thing=13][/thing]. These games are very similar in tempo, but with City-building there is an inevitable surge through the endgame that overcomes analysis paralysis and kingmaking scenarios.

But too much "take that" really spoiled my enjoyment.
I really disliked the endgame where everyone colludes to pile on the leading player. It's just not fun (even though I won).

RATING: 7.5
A light-brain-burner game that is very well produced and executed. The value of each die gives a player variable options.  All these options are viable to your eventual victory. 

The last 1 or 2 colony near end game does reduce a quick game to a paralysis state.  

Very good family game that has great theme and components to go with it.

The game takes a playing or two to get your head around all the stuff you can do and how to stop other players from doing what they want to do. And those first couple games might last a little longer than you might like. But after that the game should move along nicely. There are lots of options and different routes to victory which is nice. For every way there is for someone to gain victory points or screw you over there is generally a counter in the game somewhere which adds some much needed balance. In the first couple games you might experience a bit of a run away leader issue as the players are still exploring these options. All in all a solid game. Probably best with 3 or 4 players but playable with 2. The rules are very easy to explain which makes getting into the game a lot quicker than in similar games.

Most of the good things that you've heard about Alien Frontiers are true! But now for the negatives:
-the setting of the game is in the middle of the dense Analysis Paralysis Nebula.....
-while it's quite a good game, Alien Frontiers is a little long for what it offers. This is due to AP and how the game ends: the game immediately ends when your last colony is placed. Obviously, if you're not winning, you're sure not gonna place your last colony! And you'll definitely know if you're winning or not because there is no end-of-game final scoring: it's absolutely clear who is in the lead.
Neither a positive or a negative, I must disagree with those who say that the rules are a breeze. They're not; it will all make sense after one play, but it's kinda heavy when you're just reading through them.

PROS
- Intuitive board, once it's explained to you. The dice placement spots makes sense and works together. 
- Alien tech cards are fun and "breaks" rules of the game in cool ways
- Interaction with other players with option to screw them over too
- The dice are nice and big to roll 
- Area control is great to do and adds another level to the game 

CONS
- Downtime is a bitch! You have nothing to do when it's not your turn besides wait for the other players to go. 
- Analysis Paralysis is very common. If you have a player that takes a long time for turns, it's probably going to take even longer in this game. So many combos you can do to try and get what you want while others wait. 
- Bash the leader near the end. Whoever might win, everybody tries and gangs up on them so it gives off a bad vibe for the game where "teams" are not a part of the game.

An excellent dice game.  Because each roll the options you have is different, it's very exciting to roll to see what you get.  I like player interaction as well as the VP is tight and you can use your dice to hurt others or benefit yourself.  Fun game!  I agree with the hype :)

One play, 2 players. The beginning of the game felt curiously broken, as I was blocked out of obtaining additional workers by my opponent two turns in a row, and then his dice advantage let him easily get the straight needed to steal the resources I had been accumulating in the meantime. I was able to climb back in via using a couple of plasma rifles to blow away two of his dice, and then make use of the cheaper colony constructor due to a power up. Holographic decoy helped make sure none of my key cards got stolen either. Overall fairly interesting but I think newer dice placement games have improved upon it pretty significantly, though one play is perhaps not enough to give a fair judgement

This gets a provisional 5 on just one playing because although the theme and dice mechanic are quite interesting the 5 player game I played had such a long time between turns waiting for other players to decide what to do that in the end I didn't care who won as long as it was over. Second playing a year later with 3 other good gamers was more fun but it's still a bit too fussy for me as people need to calculate their next move for too long

RATING: 5
A mish mash of mechanics seen before in Kingsburg and To Court The King, with more than a dash of take that added. Players allocating all their dice in their turn, coupled with the impossibility of planning ahead and complicated by special powers does lead to some downtime.  Ultimately, like Kingsburg, this one outstays its welcome.  There really isn't enough going on in this simple build your engine then dash for victory game to merit ninety minutes of anyone's time.

I really liked the retro artwork and Alien Frontiers is overall a very good quality production.

Ahh.. messed up rules, didn't deal each player a card.  Better game w/ more cards, but still too much AP (Analysis Paralysis) and nothing to do between turns.

Second play took a bit too long overall and between turns. Also, I think the game has less strategic depth than I initially thought.

Dice placement game with a sci-fi theme. Players gather resources and build colonies on a newly discovered planet. Each area of the planet gives a cool ability to the player who has majority there. It takes around 2 hours for a 4 player game

There is a lot of interaction through card play and the use of the raid action allow players to steal resources. Not the kind of interaction that I like. It leads to kingmaking. 

There are better dice placement game nowadays.

Rating after 1 game:

Beautiful artwork and lovely design.

Lots of options and plenty of choices to make, however, having to wait for a dice roll to plan your turn seems to lead to AP is quite a few people.  

The game plays way too long for the satisfaction level.

I will play it again, but there are many other games I'd lean toward first.

RATING: 7
I'm not convinced that you have enough control to mitigate bad dice rolls given the sometimes limited options/spaces available.  In other words, you can play as optimally as possible and still lose (by a long shot).  As a result, I dropped my initial rating from an 8.1 to a 7.

This is still a fun worker placement game brimming with theme and it makes for a great gateway game.

Big plus: the mechanic with the ships=dice, it bring something new if the board games world.

Nice: almost with every die you get to do something.

Not nice: if two players start 'screwing' each other, the games is no longer fun for the rest.

Minuses: it's kind of obvious how to play to win and the giant amount of random

I will play it more, it has the potential for an 8.

Mar-2012: changed rating to 8, after another 4 player game

Apr-2012: back to 7, after another game. The flaws I saw in the beginning are still there, but harder to see in some of the games. One of them... I was able to catch up in two turn from being last and having 1 point to being second (tied for 1st) with 8 points. It just does not work that way for me

Being a HUGE fan of classic science fiction (before it was perverted to adventure fantasy by Star Wars ;)) I really appreciate the whole aesthetic and theme of this game.

RATING: 5.5
After a bit of time with this game, I feel ... conflicted.
I don't hate it, but there is something about it which also stops me from really liking it.  I'm glad to have it because it's a fairly casual game with some cool combo elements and thinking involved, so it can appeal to everyone.
The problem, I think, is the end game.  There is too much control for the winning player to decide when to end the game, and since all values are known a person can decide to 'win now' or not.  In almost every case it has been the player who goes first that has won.

Alien frontiers is usually fun while you're playing it, and then falls flat on the finish.  There's little tension or little of one player gaining any real power (it's almost too easy to be crumbled if the other players want to do so) to pull ahead.

On the flip side, with all the cool tech cards that let you manipulate the dice and board positions, it really is the most fun dice game I've played.  Again, it's just the final turn or two that make it such a damper.

Another interesting "[thing=2243][/thing] on steroids" style game.  Here players are space colonists fighting for control over various regions of a planet.  Feels kind of like [thing=37380][/thing] in that after you roll your dice you see how to best manage them to claim various goals and benefits.  Features a lot of player interaction which manifests in a number of ways (stealing resources, jockeying for colony position, simply blocking desired actions from others, etc.).  The components are fantastic, with beautiful art (both on the board and cards) and well though out bits.  I do however have a little issue with the non-standard box size in that it doesn't really stack up well next to boxes like [thing=36218][/thing] nor [thing=9209][/thing] nor games like [thing=31260][/thing] (it does however stack up decently with smaller square boxed games like [thing=74][/thing] and [thing=25669][/thing]).  The rules are really easy to understand and once completely understood, the game plays smoothly and quickly.  I only wish the ending were a bit more climatic as towards the end-game it can feel fairly obvious as to who will win (which results in a lot of bash the leader and a little king-making).  Overall a great light to medium weight game which appeals to a wide array of gamers and non-gamers alike.

Uses dice for ships, each turn you roll each ship. Based on the combinations of the dice you can buy new ships, get resourses, buy cards, or found colonies. Cards and colonies allow you to modify the dice, or other bonuses. Pretty good game but not much to do on other players turn and since there are many ways to use the dice it can lead to AP for some players.

RATING: 7
Kingsburg with a sci-fi theme? Well, you're pretty close but also a bit far off with that description . There are a few differences that make it a whole different bird. Yes. You still allocate resources to build up your particular kingdom/empire. But the worker (dice) placement here can be much more cutthroat. You can very often get blocked out of what you really wanted and have no real recourse. In this game you have the Alien Artifact location which allows you to get cards with certain abilities that can really swing things in your direction. Except for the Leader cards that come with To Forge a Realm there isn't anything like that in Kingsburg. This one also has the ability to hugely mess with your opponent in a fashion other than just taking the stuff they wanted. The Raider's Outpost is certainly very close to an attack option but there are ways to mitigate it. The biggest difference of course is the area control aspect of the game. This not only determines the scoring, it gives you awesome abilities later on though other players can battle it out with you for them. All in all Alien Frontiers is an awesome game. Had we not already owned Kingsburg this game might rate a 10 but we so love Kingsburg that its hard to place this complex sibling higher.

The roll of two to six dice determine what actions you can do. Strategically make plans and contingency plans based on your roll. The game can take a long time because you never know what you can do until you roll your dice. No matter how good your plans are, if you don't get the roll that you need, you might end up making moves that pretty much waste your turn. This is a good game for people who like to think on their feet and can see many scenarios and determine a course of action quickly.
Castles of Burgundy plays like Alien Frontiers, but shorter.  I would choose that over Alien Frontiers because it's way less complicated and shorter playing/learning time. Having said that, I still like Alien Frontiers for the more advanced players.
Right now, I'm really into games that use dice to determine actions because they add "luck" factor.

I got the new 4th edition as part of the Rocket Dice kickstarter (no Rocket Dice yet) and there was still a printing error on the board (one of the colonization tracks had no arrows). Not a big deal, just a bit disappointing. Anyways, the game played really well. I thought that I had it in the bag and everyone turned their attention to me and the player right behind me won. I feel like this game would have a lot of that (though only 1 play so far) as it is so cut-throat that you can really nail someone if you put your mind to it. I like a bit of "take-that" in my worker placements, and I didn't think that the game was overly mean. In our game we had a clear divide between the top two players and the bottom. There is definitely a feel of the rich get richer but it might be that we all tried different strategies and some worked better than others. I loved the theme and thought that the area control aspect was implemented well and the mechanics were sound. I expect the rating may go up after repeated plays. Very fun game.

Very good use of dice rolling in which you always have options even if you didn't roll the way you wanted to. Good balance between luck and strategy and very interesting strategic decisions throughout. Games are always close in the end, and scores can really swing as players fight for the minimal ways to get points.

Slight downside is that you can't plan out your turn ahead of time since your dice stay on the board until the start of your turn. This can lead to downtime between turns.

This could be the best dice game in the vein of Kingsburg, Airships, etc. that I've played.  Could.  But eh, I gotta go with Airships.  My key hangup is downtime.  I hate waiting around for people to map out the dice usage for their turn, and expect them to hate waiting around for me too.  We played with 3P, I'm pretty sure I'd never want to play the game with more, and I still felt like the downtime was excessive.  This can be player-dependent, of course, but playing by gut can be disastrous in this game because of the clever opportunities that exist.  Because players' dice block the board, they can't pre-roll between turns.  And using proxy dice for the blockers would seem awkward to me.  I want this game to be an 8, but I think it's a 6 for me.

After one play, I enjoy it a lot.  There's a bit more confrontation than I was expecting, but I do like the variety of decisions available based on the roll of the dice.  The people I played about were less enthused, not liking the downtime (which is usually a big problem for me, but not here).  They agreed it would probably better with less players, so I need to try it with 2 or 3.

For me, this is a perfect balance of simlicity and serious decision making. The game piles on the complexity of choices as the game goes on. The Alien tech cards give an excellent flavor to functions. As you play the game more, you become more familiar with what tech cards are available.  The visual presentation reminds me of 50s/60s scifi art, which is something different than the norm. I wish this game was more commonly available.

RATING: 8.5
I have been pleasantly surprised by this game at each turn.  Initially, the design was interesting enough to pull me in, the 50's style Sci-Fi art is fantastic and really looks great on the table.  The graphic design (icons, layout, etc) is very clear and top notch.  When I got to actual game play, turn 2 hit and suddenly the light game was showing some real interesting decisions.  It became clear that there are several factors in the game that the players really can exploit.  The key factors are ships, territory benefits, alien tech cards, and the 3 special projectors.  First play focused on the ships quickly with territory and tech a close second.  But subsequent play revealed that all 4 of these must be utilized to ensure the best results.  Its easy to set aside the discard functions of the cards or the use of the projectors as 'too expensive', but that really sells the game short.  The balance of all of these factors really provides a solid depth of play that isn't expected in a "dice game".  the game seems to buck the trend that help one's self is better than neutralizing an opponent - and that really makes the game play out quite interestingly,  The game is very well made; except the dice appear to be a little shy of square.  I haven't measured this, but to the eye they appear off.  All other aspects of the game are very good.  Glad I purchased my copy.  Already looking forward to expansions. [Oct '10]

Update: Upped rating after many more plays.  A really easy game to teach and a game that scales well with player skills.  Dice concerns also eliminated.  Very solid game in both play and components. [Mar '11]

I really like the 1950's space artwork in this one, and wanted it to do more for me than it did.  

This will inevitably be compared to Kingsburg.  For me the preference is for Kingsburg over this.  You always place your dice after the person to your right, which means that you're always dependent on their play style.  I prefer Kingsburg's mechanism where you rotate based on the number of pips they have on that roll.

What really brings the game down for me is the amount of bash the leader and 'take that' that you see with this game.  Towards the end it's about reining in the leader rather than executing on your own strategy.  Will play again to see if my impressions change.

Somewhat fun but seems determined largely by turn order and dice rolls. Going first and rolling well allows one to monopolize the few locations that really matter. Sure, you can pick up a card that blows other "ships" out of the way, but it doesn't change the limited choices available each turn.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Dice rolling so some people are going to hate it. More than enough thought required each turn for it to be more than a luckfest though.
There does seem to be an obvious need to get more ships early and if you never roll doubles that's going to hold you back a lot. Apart from that most of the game is deciding what to do now, and what to do later, from the things that will help you colonise the planet.

Space Yahtzee with AP tendencies, especially late game if 6-7 dice are in play for AP prone people.  It has a heavy dose of luck, take-that, and chaos.

This does not.

I wanted to really love this game; it has gorgeous components, and a wonderful theme. Initial gameplay is also interesting, and full of potential. The game however suffers from two pretty fundamental problems: 
1) Complete inability to plan ahead during opponent's turns, since you won't be able to roll your dice until your turn (and to a lesser degree, since the locations where you want to place them might only be blocked or opened up on any other player's turn). Having a second set of "planning" dice (and pre-determined houserules for what to do when you lose one of your dice after rolling these) is essential for speeding up the game to bearable levels.
2) Perfect information about the score of all players upon reaching the end game condition, leading players to play to prevent a win by anyone else, thus causing the game to drag on beyond the natural ending point.

Late-game turns take a long time, since the possession of many dice, and many alien tech cards, will mean many different ways of potentially altering dice, and thus many paths to explore for the optimal way to use the dice. Meanwhile other players are going to be bored out of their skulls waiting for this process.

On the positive side: Despite lots of dice rolling, there's very little luck factor influencing the outcome of the game. Very well done that, inviting comparisons to Troyes.

I had been really looking forward to this, but was a little disappointed.  I think the basic game is excellent, but the cards add too much "chaos" to the game.  They also extend the game significantly, as folk take two or three attempts to work out which order they need to do things to get the best result.  Perhaps if I were more familiar with the cards, it would flow better, but I'm not sure.  And they're probably necessary as a catch-up mechanism.  I'd be more than happy to try this again, but I would use a timer (60 secs?) to move things along somewhat.

I love the Colony miniatures, the dice mechanic combined with the options available on the board mean that you're rarely left with few or no useful options. I would just echo the point made elsewhere that it's best not played with someone who takes a long time over their turn since there's only limited planning that you can do between turns.

RATING: 4
Too much downtime, too much direct conflict, and with aggressive, conflict AP driven players, this game goes from 90 minutes to 3 hours.  It has a creative use of dice and interesting options, but the boredom between turns and the inability to mitigate the "human" factor of aggressive personalities makes this a game that I will only play with very specific people, namely those who do not own, nor desire to own the game due to these same reasons.

First play was a 2-player game with Trisha and a lot of fun.  On paper AF looks like it might be just another Kingsburg or Stone Age but there is so much "cool" stuff in AF to make it more fun.  The cards are cool.  the territories are cool.  the orbital platforms are cool.  there's lots of opportunities to chain some clever moves together.  

The big thing is that it seems to strike a good balance between letting the dice have some effect on the game without making it feel like they were totally taking it over.

We both liked it a lot!

Update:  I've now played AF a few more times and with more players.  I will say that down-time CAN be an issue while the active player shift their dice around from one possibility to the next, but on the whole this has alwayws been a really fun game with lots of direct interaction and competition between all involved.

Szuper ez a játék!!! Mielőtt kipróbáltam, csak ennyit hallottam mindenfelől: "Jobb, mint a Kingsburg!" Nos  szerintem az Alien Frontiers annyira magasan veri a Kingsburgot, hogy teljesen más szintet képviselnek.  A Kingsburgban amúgy is hiányoltam a dinamikát (ugyanaz zajlik végig, lehetne 3-szor olyan hosszú, vagy rövidebb, semmi sem változna), de ez után a játék után kifejezetten laposnak érzem a Kinsburgot, pedig nem olyan rossz játék úgy önmagában véve az se. Inkább az Al. Frontiers a túl jó! Egyértelműen toronymagasan a legjobb kockás, amivel valaha játszottam. Az áradozás után egy kis konkrétum, hogy miért is tetszik annyira (pedig csak kettest próbáltam, milyen lehet a 3-4 fős??):
Először is egyszerű a rendszere, mégis sok dilemma elé állít minket, ez általában jó egy játéknál. A kockák felhasználási helyei ötletesek, nincs nagyon rossz dobás,a bónuszlapkák és a kártyák is jók, nagyon jól össze van gyúrva az egész. Elég interakció, konfrontáció is van a játékban (kártyalopás, helyek elfoglalása). Nehéz elhúzni, és ha le is maradok, nincs az az érzésem, hogy teljesen esélytelen, és elmegy a kedvem is az egésztől.
Nem mellékesen a játék szép, ikonrendszere is jó! Nyelvfüggőek ugyan a kártyák, és a lapkák, de összesen 20-30 mondat az egész (12 féle kártya, 8 lapka).
Mindenkinek ajánlom, nemcsak a kockajátékok kedvelőinek. Lehet, hogy még javítani is fogok a 9 ponton.
Szegény Kingsburg, ezután nehezen fog előkerülni. Meg a Troyes is, Alea is...
Amit majdnem elfelejtettem: egyszer sem merült fel a játék során, hogy "jaj de mákod volt", "jaj de pechem volt". Tudom, hogy kocka=szerencse, de a sok lehetőség miatt nem annyira szerencsefüggő a játék, mint azt az ember gondolná. Ha az ellenfél túl jó kártyához jut, ellophatjuk tőle, ha rosszat dobunk, viszonylag olcsón módosíthatjuk (sok kártya van, ami erre szolgál), dinamikus a játék, nincs benne szinte semmi, ami végleges!
---
4-es is jó!! Nagyon tuti ez a rendszer, aminek a lényege, hogy a többiek kockája mindig foglalja a helyet (de azért kártyákkal lehet ez ellen tenni).
Saját bőrömön tapasztaltam, hogy a pontazonosság esélye nagyon nagy a játékban, 4 fő esetén szinte biztos, és ilyenkor a kártyák száma dönt. Ezzel nagyon felértékelődnek a kártyák, erre fontos odafigyelni. Hiába áll valaki látszólag jól kolóniák terén, ha valaki szerez váratlanul egy 1 pontot érő kártyát. Ha egy játékban akár 6 összpontszámmal nyerni lehet, ott bizony nüanszok döntenek:)
---
Nem érzem elég kompenzációnak az elején azt az 1-2 nyersanyagot a kezdővel szemben. Ha a végén a kezdő fejezi be, és végig ugyanannyi kockával dobott mint a többiek, akkor mivel eggyel több köre volt, akár 6-tal több kockával dobhatott a játék során, ami jelenthet akár 18 nyersanyagot is. Persze ez a dilemma a legtöbb "azonnal vége" játéknál fennáll.

I love dice, hence the love for this one. Simple and elegant in its retro look..The 2p game is somewhat non-restrictive in terms of acts you might be able to take (most of the time anyway). I trust that with more players it has to be really tight. Will check in due time..
UPDATE: Definitely my favorite medium weight dice game. Love the feel, the looks, the different ways to win. You never feel like you can do ABSOLUTELY NOTHING important with your dice (as is the case with other games of the genre). Yes, the luck factor from rolling dice IS there so if you prefer to have complete control over your actions, stay away from the game. If not, you will enjoy this immensely, even though it can get a little AP-prone since you cannot really plan your turn in advance (you roll your dice at the start of your turn). Overall, if you like dice, worker placement or better their combination, this game is fun in spades in a box.

A Troyes with a space theme. One of the few games that have better illustrations in the main game than the cover. My problem here is the same as Troyes: I don't like plain stealing things from the opponent. I like interaction but not in such an immediate way. Oh,I rolled that, so I just steal the things you gathered. Another thing I don't like are the names on the technology cards. Too mainstream, too boring, lacks in atmosphere on that part. But overall, it's a nice Troyes alternative that has very balanced scoring.

Initial Impression: This is a great dice-rolling worker placement game with some area control mixed in. It's a race in that the first person to make it to the victory point goal wins. The real twist in this game is that the dice are rolled and become the workers. Brilliant idea with a wonderful theme slapped on and the beautifully produced components add to the flavor.

Rating is with the Factions and expansion/promo packs listed below mixed into the base game.

Alien Frontiers (Fifth Edition) is an easy to learn, cleverly designed game that also presents itself attractively. The game is mostly Ameritrash dressed up in a well-tailored European suit. Its dressings, however, made me initially approach Alien Frontiers with a euro-game sensibility, but I was quickly disabused of that notion. This game is about the dice-rolling, the combo-building, the area control, the resource/technology stealing, and the colony-building race. These mechanisms come together to form a playground that allows a dice-based fight over territories. Alien Frontiers can be a great fun time, and seems best suited for higher player counts. Its probably best for a group of 3-4 friends (or family) that want to banter among themselves more than fret over the strategic nuances of a board game. 

However, downtime between turns can be a problem for those higher player counts, so it really depends on the people involved in the game session. While it makes zero sense to plan your next turn during the downtime, Alien Frontiers makes you interested in what other people are rolling and doing on their turn (e.g., are they going to take the 3, 4 and 5, and steal my best technology card?!), so the downtime isn't abhorrent. Still, there is a potential for players to lack focus on placing colonies onto the board, and this can also add time to the game session. There is potential for Alien Frontiers to overstay its welcome. 

The player factions seem only OK. Some of them are boring and, depending on the specific power, the applicability in a particular game session can be limited to only certain portions of the game. I could see playing this game without the factions and being fine.

The agenda cards of the Factions expansion, however, are a great fit for the game, and I doubt I'd play it without the agendas.

For my collection, this game will compete most closely with Lords of Waterdeep for table time. The Skullport module of Lords of Waterdeep pushes that game up a bit over this one in my estimation.

Very good first impression (rating has good chances to be upgraded after some more plays):

+ Short playing time (less than 90 minutes for 4 first time players)
+ Some of the easiest rules I've ever encountered; Gameflow can be explained in three sentences.
+ Nontheless a complex game
+ Good balance between different options 
+ Territory boni and Alien cards are well intergrated (important for winning and not simply thematic chrome)
+ Great player interaction for a Euro
+ Iconography is brilliant (so there will be no rulebrowsing when trying to find out 
+ Great artwork and cool theme
+ Works with 4 as well as with 2 players (haven't tried 3 so far)

- Slight downtime problems
- Early bad luck hinders development enormously (no doubles = no 4th ship = pita)

Is this the ultimate game??, it has everything, fantastic components, artwork, gameplay. this game is amazing, easy to learn, addictive to play. ok its got dice, lots of dice, yet its no luck fest, you can manipulate the dice scores with cards, how you place the dice onto the different parts of the board changes everything. you can defend, you can attack/raid opponents. you can customize game length by deciding how many colonies to play with. amazing board, tons of options per go, always fresh (you wont play the same game twice), lots of screwage, just fun fun fun....with a huge dollop of fun thrown in for good measure.
CLEVER MOJO games are ones to watch, this game is incredible, i also own OGRE CASTLE by clever mojo, i urge you to just buy it, its equaly amazing fun. as a family we own tons of games, alien frontiers & ogre castle are the one that hit the table the most...& for very good reason, they are both a blast to play...always a good time to be had, guaranteed :)

REALLY COOL GAME. Thematically rich, strategically deep, but with enough luck to maintain a fun atmosphere where everyone isn't massaging their temples every move. Great spin on worker placement where you roll and place dice (your "ships" in this game) at different orbital facilities around a planet. The goal is to colonize the planet most efficiently to gain points. There are multiple paths to victory and the scores are constantly fluctuating and there aren't usually big point disparities.

Now, not to rip on new players.  It's just that kicking each other in the shins is such an integral part of really enjoying this game, it's hard to both:
a) introduce people to the game
b) tell them that kicking and being kicked in the shins is the fun of it.

Like, where do you draw the line?  I mean, if all they think they can do is harvest ore or energy, it's a boring, boring game.  Likewise though, you don't want to go all raid-happy on them the second round, either.  So it takes a bit of trust to really learn this game, and then you don't figure out what the fun things you can do are, until late in the second half of the game.

6-23-11 Traded:

The short story:  I got sick of always introducing it...to myself.  So whenever I played it, I'd never be good enough to have a sense of knowing what I was doing.

It's a good game, but there's a sweet spot when everyone has had 5-10 plays of it, that this game is not going to hit---considering that I either play with gamers or non-gamers.  Either they don't play any games, or they essentially play too many other games to get good at this one game.  When it has the ubiquity of Stone Age, it will be awesome...  it will also be easy to find at a game day then, too.

The first game is, a first game.  This will suffer from not fully understanding the options laid-out before you worse than normal, but do remember that when you know what you're doing, there's quite a bit of conflict.

Games 2-5, I like to think of as "Hungry Hungry Hippos" with dice.  You're just sort of grabbing stuff as you can grab it, with only a vague sense of direction.

Turns 1-5 : getting to 5 ships.  Anything remaining goes to getting alien tech cards or the bare minimum resources you need to get those 5 ships.
Turns 6-? : With alien tech cards, you can do darn near anything you want on any turn you want.  This is where the Hungry Hungry Hippos shows-up.  Need resources, you can get resources.  Need colonies?  You can get colonies.  ...and eventually so many rule-breaks and special abilities show up that you can't keep track of all your own rules anyway.  "Oh crap, I forgot about this card".  "Oh crap, I forgot about this ability".

So I just end up grabbing crap, one base is just as good as any other.  If there's any design flaw, it's that they give you a TON of stuff, all potentially useful, to do with your dice, regardless of the roll.

Now, it's still good.  While you can go anywhere almost regardless of the dice roll, it doesn't mean you SHOULD go anywhere.   ...and that's where you really need to have most of the folks at the table (myself included) really know the game, all the rule break cards, all the colonies.  Strategic use of the raider's outpost (it's not just for revenge anymore), knowing what properties are hot and what are hotter, and the list goes on.

Without really knowing the game, I didn't feel any sense of direction nor was I interested in what everyone else was doing.  No, 'oh crap, they got that colony\alien tech card' or 'yes, I got the whatever!' (relic ship is still cool).  I was just sort of going through the motions, once the dice mechanics of the game lost their newness.  If I can trust that this game will see play 10-15 times with mostly the same people, it will definitely find it's way back into the collection.

Interesting worker/dice placement, I was slightly sceptical about the mechanics but they work quite nicely, you can have meaningful choices regardless of the dice, but of course the prevent you from doing much long-term planning and I believe this does not work at all for analysis paralysis prone people, since you can't plan your own turn beforehand and the dice have to stay on board filling spaces in others turns. Interesting sidenote is that this game doesn't need a first player marker at all, rare in these kinds of games.

Nice tactical dice rolling game set in space. The theme is really very thin but that's mostly the case with these sort of games. The gameplay is a lot more involved than other dice rollers. The addition of a board with actual area majority really spices up the game. Also it seems there is something decent to do with every turn and even there is no such thing as a string of bad rolls ruining your game. One issue I found is that it seems very powerful to end the game. In our first game three people had the chance to end the game and if they succeeded they all would have had the most points. Some jumping from last to first place. But this could also be due to inexperience. For now this is my favorite dice roller.

I would like to play a 2 player game to see how well it scales down from 4.  I generally like games where you have to manage the chaos.  Using dice as workers fits nicely into that.  There are tech cards which allow you to manipulate the dice, which improves the management of chaos.

In my one play of this game I found it merely OK. I like the idea of the game, using dice like workers to gain stuff, but I found the mechanism more enjoyable in Kingsburg. Perhaps part of the problem was the fact that I played with 2 seasoned pros who knew exactly how to demolish me, but even so I just didn't feel like the choices on each turn were all that interesting. It also seemed like players might form a somewhat standard path to victory with enough experience. Again I must say that I didn't particularly hate Alien Frontiers, it just gave me nothing to love. I'd play again if someone twisted my arm, but I definitely don't feel like it's a must-play.

In a 4-player game, the AP was crippling.  Based on this experience, I'd rate the game a 4 or 5.  Granted, one player was particularly bad.

This is rated a 6 on the optimistic hope that 3 reasonable-paced players would be a much better time.

I had Alien Frontiers on my "want to play" list for a few years... just not high on the list. When the opportunity presented itself, I took it. This is an okay game with fun ways to adjust the dice results and push colonists to planets. It's clearly important to be willing to lose a die in order to gain a colony. I'd play again and I have no big urge to do so.

I like the theme, i am a huge fan of using dice as workers (think kingsburg), however with 2 players destroying dice seems to powerful, while with 4, the game seems to move to slowly.

Still, i do have fun with the game (note the rating), and we'll have to see how this rates with more plays going forward.

I like it, but too long for my usual tastes. Would be a seven if it didn't often take up to 2 hours.

I usually hate special rule-breaking cards with text, but they're actually not as bad here as in many games.  Think somewhere in between Dominion and Conquest of Planet Earth, and closer to the former.

I probably would have preferred ditching the special cards and tweaking the game to play in under an hour.  As-is, I will play it occasionally if others suggest.  I don't dislike it at all, it is very engaging.

This is a fun dice placement game and I enjoyed my plays and ios plays. I have thought about purchasing the game, but it is a bit light for what I would prefer to play. I also really dislike how the publisher has released so many expansions and content that the overall game system is just bloated at this point. This is similar to what happened with Among the Stars. I backed the Big Box on kickstarter, but backed out once the delays started. A fine game that I would play, but not anything I'm looking to own.

My first worker placement game. I really like it, with the only complaint being that you can't really plan out your next turn until it's actually your turn which can lead to some slowing of the game. Great suggestion I heard (but have yet to try) is to give each player a total amount of 15 minutes for all of their turns, tracked with timers, and -1 VP for each minute over they go.

Very abstract and brain-burning for a dice game.  I think it feels this way as a result of being overloaded with things that you could do... and trying to figure out what will give you a small edge over your opponents in this tug-of-war, area control game.  

As for strategies... I'm not sure if sacrificing a ship on the terraforming orbital is worthwhile compared to keeping all of your ships (dice) and making colonies via the other 2 methods that don't consume a ship.

RATING: 8
I like this game a lot.  Although there is a lot of dice rolling, and it's difficult to form an immediate strategy, there is always something you can do with your dice.  Also with a bit of thought, often with the dice you roll your strategy can be achieved by a different method.  There's an amount of interaction with other players too with the ability to block their dice or steal their resources.  The game is light hearted enough so that stealing other people's stuff never seems too mean!  I would definitely like to play this more.

A Dice based, worker placement, resource collection, area control game! In space! 

Lots of clever mechanisms in place here, but the game is pretty simple at heart. The key bit comes in working out how to chain your turn together to best utilise the dice pips you have available to you. As in if I place the "4" dice here, I get two wafer resources, I spend those to use this card to flip that "5" dice up one and that "3" dice down one, so now I have 2 "6" dice which I can place to get 2 ore resources and now I have enough ore to place those two "3" dice to get another ship! 

Plenty of attacking other players, the natural urge to stop the leader and the chance someone can come from behind with a late run if you're not watching carefully. Doesn't last to long either. 

Great fun!

What a solid game!  Every aspect of this game seems extremely well thought out.  The artwork and icons and bits are polished--the production quality is top-notch.  The game play offers many MANY options to pursue every turn... even if you have an idea of what you want to go for but the dice don't yield exactly what you wanted to see, there may be another way to get there with clever utilization of cards or other locations on the board.  And typically a game's theme isn't much of a factor in my book at all, but the artwork and theme of this game just really clicked with me (vintage science fiction).

I can't wait to buy a copy of this when it is released!

A real sweet-spot mash-up of tried-and-true mechanics found in some classic including El Grande and Kingsburg. It's not necessarily better than either of those, but it is a fantastic marriage of the two. I cannot forsee turning down a game of this, especially with the full compliment of 4 players.

RATING: 7
I enjoyed this game, but didn't love it. The themes works well, there are plenty of choices about what to do with the dice, and rarely a time when there was nothing of use to do on your turn. The tech cards allow a little bit of engine building and some variable routes through the game, and the different elements work well and intuitively together. However, I found the end-game disappointing. I need to play again, but I got the feeling that whoever places their last colony will almost always win because there are so few VPs available, usually in the end game a point scored also removes one from an opponent, and by then you have enough tech cards to manipulate the colony position in a way that you win. This changes the game into a simple race to get colonies built, which takes some of the enjoyment out of it for me. I also think there is a risk of too much downtime between turns, and if I'm honest the game lasts just a little bit too long for what you get out of it. Good but not brilliant.

This is a "dice placement" game - similar to worker placement but with dice. I was surprised how much I enjoyed this game. The artwork, components and theme are great and the game provides plenty of interesting decisions while being relatively short to play (90 mins or so). The game is also easy to teach due to good iconography and easy-to-understand rules. The only snag is that for some reason our boys aren't that enamoured with it. The game has a few "take that" options and that may detract from it for some.

RATING: 6
One of the best games. Unfortunately, solid gameplay does not make up for the slightly less amazing end game time. For some reason, I just don't get that "my amazing actions payed off" feeling that I get with Mage Knight or Dungeon Petz/Lords at the end of the game. I still get it at the end of a turn though, which is still great. Update: lowered my score from 8 to 7. As much as I love this, the chance of it going long and not being as fulfilling as other long games seems to be high. May end up selling. Update: just so much wrong with it sometimes. Maybe the expansions? I just dislike the stealing space and too many people use it instead of playing effectively. 

Update: this game has fallen a bit from my rotation sadly, I am just not as into it. I kind of blame the expansions, and will try removing them soon.

Didn't like it as much as I expected - probably better with less players, as you can't really plan until you roll the dice. Don't like the end game though, very dependant on what technology cards are in play and who decides to move which colonies around. Overall, it was ok, but no desire to own it.

Amazing and innovative game. My only complaint is that the dice rolling before each turn can lead to turns taking 5ever. NEVER play with more than 4, or you will likely not enjoy the game due to it taking way too long to get back to you. I much prefer dice placement in which not all dice are placed simultaneously, but I still love this game.

It's intriguing.  Rolling dice determines action selection.  Not knowing powers or cards hurts the first play.  Rating will likely change upon subsequent plays.

EDIT: After a few more plays, I'm definitely not as big on it as I was.  The biggest problem is the Area Control mechanic.  There is no incentive to go into an area where someone already is, unless you want to screw them over.

RATING: 10
This is become one of my favourite games.   Goal of the game is to build colonies on the centre planet space.   A bit of a race will you, but being the player that places their last colony only ends the game, not wins the game.   

Once the game ends, the player with the most points wins.   There are a few, but limited, ways to get point with most games ending with a winning score of 12 to 16 points.

The main mechanism in the game is to roll dice (your ships), using the resulting faces of the dice (1 - 6) and place them accordingly to gather resources, move a colony launcher, build more dice, buy technology cards, of...steal stuff from your opponent(s), my favourite action.  

It is a pretty straight forward game, with a little bite, and tight game mechanisms.

First play, 3er, was a longish affair.  Played well at first, but one of the players became more and more AP'd as the game went on.  Ended with said player in a kingmaking spot, unable to win, but able to dictate who would.  Left a bad taste.

I think that players with the right attitude and a goal of keeping the game moving would make this an enjoyable game.  Whether I can make adjustments so that the next play goes that way is yet to be seen.  Lots of potential, but not for everyone.

Second play, 2er with my wife.  Much more enjoyable.  With only 2, the game is painfully zero sum, which can make it quite vicious.  But there are remedies in the alien tech cards for just about every problem your opponent can throw at you.  I liked it, and yet it might be a little too mean spirited (as a 2er) for regular play with my wife.  We'll see if she asks again.

I'm astounded this game is rated so highly.  Of course most of my group liked it too.  I despised it.  It is too long and too fiddly for what it is.  The endgame has a serious kingmaking issue.  The best play is typically to bash the next guy and hopefully hit the leader the hardest which I do not find to be fun.  There is also very little to do in your downtime (can't even make strategic decisions because you are waiting on the other players' actions to determine what you can do).  So oodles of downtime where your only task is to make sure the other player is not inadvertently cheating.

I did like the theme.  I really enjoyed the naming of the colonies after famous sci-fi authors.  And the production art was very nice and retro.  The game is long on theme but short on fun.

One play. The warnings about AP should be heeded about this game. I like the mechanics and theme, but there are a good many options for actions, which are not apparent until your dice are rolled, and there are cards that come out that need to be read and re-read. 4 hours is just too long for this game. If it was half the time I would really like to play it again. As it stands now, I'd pass if I could.

Superb graphics and design with interesting dice mechanism. With four downtime is a big problem and game also has an issue with king making. I would have wanted a part of scoring which was hidden and this would have tackled the king making problem.

I thought it would be a rethemed Kingsburg, but after I read the rules I found out that I was totally wrong and the only thing they have in common is that you are rolling dice and using them as workers.

The theme is absolutely awesome. I really like that fifties-sixties Sci-Fi look. It's great. And to name the areas on Mars after great Sci-Fi-authors is a superb idea. Love it.

The game feels better than Kingsburg since you don't have that runaway-leader problem, because the points that matter are calculated at the end. The only flaw with that is that there is no hidden scoring. If you look at the board you get an idea of who is standing where. Maybe there is an expansion for that.

I personally like it more than Kingsburg, by now. But maybe that will change with an expansion on either game.

Ugh.   This game just wasn't fun.  It was a series of uninteresting dice placement decisions that were largely repeated over and over again.  The game was too long for what it was.   Also, the penalties for getting attacked by other players were too severe, so that there were often times when you'd intentionally hold back on progressing just so your stuff wouldn't get stolen.  Lame.   Huge kingmaking issues at the end of the game too.

More surprisingly, I completely lost interest soon after the game began.   

Overall, an uninspired and mechanical affair.  Initial rating 4.  No interest in playing this game again.

Amazed that this game is so hyped.  This is probably the most overhyped game out there besides Small World.

Impressed after one play.  Beautiful graphic design, relatively simple rules, clear iconography, lots of choices -- so far, looks promising.

Repeated play is so far very satisfying.  Quick and simple to teach, 90% of the rules are indicated on the board, and the few grey areas we've encountered are clearly spelled out in the rules, with examples.  Remarkably well-balanced.  Basically, a streamlined Kingsburg in space, with little to no AP.

My only concern is that at some point it will start to feel scripted; at some times, there's clearly a best play, but at others, the decisions are nervewracking.  (I'm doing myself a favor and avoiding strategy articles on this one.)

I know there aren't a lot of plays of this game recorded, but I haven't ever been diligent about recording them here. Only found this site a few years ago, and AF was one of the first games I got.

I backed the 4th Edition of this game, and have it pimped out to the max with all the expansion packs and upgraded components.

[b]Alien Frontiers[/b] is a worker placement game.  But the workers in this game are dice, and the values you roll on your dice determine which locations you may use on the board.

It is actually a pretty good game.  However, there are limited strategies in which to play.  Consequently, the game wears thin after a dozen or so plays.  The base game badly needs some expansions.

Fun, fun game. I love how despite the fact that the entire game is predicated on random dice rolls, you can do a lot with them, and I found that I could plan several turns in advance. The "take that" factor can be pretty rough, but is equally divided among the players, so whoever gives it is going to get it in return.

Enjoyable worker placement game using dice.  Similar idea to Kingsburg, To Court the King, etc. but better executed.  Many different tactical possibilities so that rolling particular numbers (e.g., high numbers) is not that critical.  Like any of these games though, getting shut out of resources early on can be insurmountable.  I like it.

I really like Alien Frontiers.  The mechanics are delightful and the artwork/production are beautiful.  The game is easy to explain but offers lots of depth and fun choices.

That said, I'm not loving it quite as much as I first did.  The "worker-placement with dice" mechanic and the fact that your dice must stay on the board until your next turn mean that you have no way to plan ahead.  You must roll your dice and make all your decisions while other players are waiting.

Experienced players can map out a few possibilities ahead of time, but new players will always take quite a while to make their moves.  With AP-prone folks, turns can be rather torturous, especially if they have a few tech cards.

Still, with the right group, this game is exceptional.

Area majority competition for control of the planet is lacking with two players; and more players means more downtime. Since you can't roll your dice until the very beginning of your turn, there's no way to plan your turn in advance.

UPDATE II:  I continue to raise my rating on this game.  Every time I play it, I like it more.  It will never be a game I obsess over, but it is a game that gets played very often because of its cool theme and easily explained rules.  Really liking it.

UPDATE:  Liked it much better on later plays.  Raised rating.  "Take that" not as prevalent as in first couple games... Now think it may have been odd to see so much raiding.

If I need this itch scratched, I will play Kingsburg.  Adds additional complexity and a "take that" element that I do not enjoy.  I like conflict in conflict games, not in games of this weight.

This seems to be a good game though the base game doesn't seem to have long lasting play value.  Perhaps with one of the expansions it will gain more appeal.

Update:  The expansion does make this game significantly better, even without the faction cards.  I also highly recommend the upgrade pack for those that like cool looking components.

I liked it, but not as much as several other dice games I own (Castles of Burgundy, Macao).  I feel like a lot of your choices are simply dictated by your rolls, without as many options to mitigate that luck-factor as some other games.

RATING: 7
Somewhat like a grander and glossier version of Roll Through the Ages re-located to outer space, with approapriately thematic nods to classic sci-fi writers on the map.  The game mostly uses randomness well (like RTTA) but the randomness of the 'take-that' element is annoying and destructive of the overall positive feel of the game.  Possibly a little long for what it is but the playing time may reduce with more experience.

Nice try, some good ideas, clever themeing - but ultimately no dice. 3 major problems: it overstays it's welcome by about 20 minutes; it's pretty damped with not that much opportunity for skillful play to separate the players; and there is a horrible endgame AP combined with a kingmaking whack-the-leader-fest due to open scoring and plenty of oppurtunities to hose your fellow-players. I wanted to like Alien Frontiers, and almost did. Unfortunately, it still needs some work.

RATING: 6
The best dice worker placement so far. Lots of options for clever play. The aesthetics of the board are pretty awesome if you appreciate the 50's sci fi look. The one knock is that there is not really much for you to do on other player's turns - you don't really know what your options are until you roll the dice. This means that it can really drag with AP-prone players. Probably a good candidate for a timer.

RATING: 3
After an additional play, my rating is definitely dropping on this one.  The first exploratory game was fun, but I felt like the options just plain seemed limited and obvious the second go-round.

The good... I really enjoy worker placement games, and the die rolling plus worker placement is right up my alley!  I also like that, while rolling what you need is really going to help you, the alien tech cards allow you greater control over your rolls, such as allowing you add or subtract a pip, or flip a die over.  This reduces the luck factor a bit and is a very nice touch!

The bad... the game is way too rubber-bandy.  If someone jumps out to a lead, the other players have a lot they can do to harm that player until the scores even up again.  I very much dislike this element of the game, since an early lead just means you get ganged up on until the scores are evened, and the scores end up so tight that it's a total shot in the dark who will eventually end up winning.

The tacked-on-feeling area majority portion of the game greatly contributes to this.  It is way too simple to tie up the leader in his areas to rope him back in.  Once each region has a colony in it, its just a matter of who is in the lead that needs to have a point stolen from them.  Yawn.  Essentially, area majority in games works great when a lot of pieces are being played and/or the pieces in play are fairly fluid.  However, in Alien Frontiers, the pieces in play are both few and almost totally static, making it a poor mechanic to include in this particular game.

Another kick in the pants to this game is that the beginning of the game is terrible.  The obvious goal early in the game is to get more ships.  However, this depends on whether you can roll a pair on three dice.  Sure, if you're unlucky, you can go for an alien tech card that removes the luck factor a bit, allowing you to get the pair on your next turn, but those fortunate enough to add to their fleet early have a huge leg up, simply because they were able to roll a pair on their first turn.  In addition, the starting player has absolutely no chance of getting a ship on the first turn due to the start player handicapping, which is a rather large disadvantage.

I like to have various strategic options in this game, and in the early game, there is simply no option other than to build your fleet (if you'd like to have a shot at winning).  Since more ships = more options and actions, there are simply no other viable starting options other than building a fleet, which there is only one way to do.  I would wager that it's impossible to win if you don't do this early on.  So, until a fair bit into the game, everyone is trying to do the exact same thing, which doesn't sit right with me.

In the end, if you like rolling dice and you like worker placement, give it a try.  I don't think the entire game is terrible by any means, but I found it has too many elements I dislike, plus some elements that I perceive as flaws in the game design to make it worthwhile to me.  Obviously, there are a lot of people that enjoy it, so if the things that bother me aren't things that would bother you, go for it!

RATING: 4
Updated 10/30/10.

[thing=48726]Alien Frontiers[/thing] probably doesn't deserve this spot on this list just yet.  But I have a soft spot for small-publisher games.  I also suspect that two-player Alien Frontiers is not the game's strong suit.  Strike that.  I suspect that two-player Alien Frontiers may simply be unplayable.  

My disappointment with Alien Frontiers is that it is essentially a tableau game -- like [thing=28143]Race for the Galaxy[/thing] -- masquerading as a worker-placement and area-control game.  I’m not generally a fan of tableau games, and in this case, the tableau causes several problems that affirmatively detracts from the game. 

For the unfamiliar, Alien Frontiers uses dice in a manner not unlike [thing=27162]Kingsburg[/thing], essentially a roll-and-place action selection system.  Unlike other dice games such as Kingsburg and [thing=34635]Stone Ag[/thing]e, Alien Frontiers treats dice as more than a random sum generator.  For the majority of the actions one can select, the numbers shown on the dice are irrelevant or only marginally relevant; what is important is the relationship between dice.  Some actions require two or three matching dice, some require three sequential dice, and some require one or more dice of any number.  High rolls are far from essential.

Although Alien Frontiers’ innovation on the dice-placement system would seem to be beneficial to mitigate dice randomness, it guts from the game much of what is appealing about the worker placement system: strategic blocking.  By tying some of the best spots on the board to particularly rare combinations of die rolls, Alien Frontiers replaces player competition for scarce spaces with a random constraint on those spaces.  The system actually hampers your ability to plan around another player’s wants and needs, so you end up playing a much more solitary game.

The solitaire feeling of the game is further exacerbated by the fact that many of the more accessible core board spots are so balanced that using any one of them rarely appeared sub-optimal.  Consequently the allocation decisions felt relatively meaningless.  (For what it's worth, my wife's opinion was, "I'm not sure that I liked it, but it was nice not having to think.").  

The game introduces Alien Tech cards that grant players special powers (usually involving beneficial dice or resource manipulation) in an attempt to generate some player stratification.  This is the tableau I was referring to.  Compared to the spaces on the board, these cards seem very desirable (similar to the cards in Stone Age that everyone underestimates until the end of the game).  The powers are cheap enough to use that players will often want to activate several cards on a single turn.  But the more Alien Tech cards players collect, the harder they are to keep track of (and they are extremely text-heavy), which meant the worker placement aspect becomes further marginalized.  If I don't know what my opponent can do, then I don't know what they'll want to do, so I can't plan to block them even if I have the dice, so the best I can do is just take what I want most and hope it interferes with them somehow.   The designer has managed to turn worker placement into something with the solitary feel of Dominion.

The upside to the lack of decision space is that we didn't face any downtime issues until the very end of the game. It was just roll, place, roll, place, etc.  With more players, or the wrong group, I could see AP being a problem, though.  Especially with a large tableau of Tech cards allowing you to flip this die, add one to that die, steal this card, use that card, etc.

The goal of all this dice rolling and placement is purportedly to settle colonies to control areas on some distant moon/planet.   However, the way the points are scored (1 point per colony, 1 point for a majority in an area), two-player area control is a zero sum proposition and thus completely uninteresting.  There is too much board space and no incentive to ever have more than a bare majority of colonies in an area.  The game tries to rectify this with powers for controlling certain areas, but, like many of the core board spaces, they kind of felt interchangeable.

The way the board is balanced, I can't see any player discovering a strategy to take a big lead in colonizing, at least with just two players.  Since the game ends when a player places their last colony, the first person to do so in a two-player game should, by default, win by one or two points.  It seems like this should be the starting player more often than not.  (And that one energy token for going second isn’t really much of an offset.)  There are two Tech cards, which may or may not come out during the game, that each give 1 VP.  If the second player manages to snag both of those, I suppose it could go the other way.  However, something about this whole aspect of the game just seems flat, if not downright broken. (We under-utilized the pirating space because it was late and we didn't feel like being ruthless on a first play of a new game, so maybe that's the key to fixing this issue?)  After playing [thing=62219]Dominant Species[/thing] this month, I would have loved to see other ways of benefitting from being in a region, even when you don’t have an outright majority. 

This may all sound negative, but I’m not ready to give up on Alien Frontiers yet.  My very preliminary opinion is that Alien Frontiers is fine, but likely too shallow to be interesting (at this point, I would lump it in with games like [thing=40692]Small World[/thing] and Stone Age).  It’s the sort of game that appeals to people who, like my wife, find it nice not to think sometimes.  It’s also the sort of game for people who can get immersed in a theme simply because they like the theme – people who write strategy articles titled “[thread=577673]High Octane Dictkitude[/thread]” or who make explosion noises when activating the plasma cannon.  I’m not one of those people.  

As far as dice games go, I probably prefer it marginally to Stone Age.  I greatly prefer it to Kingsurg.  I bought it because there are some dice-lovers in my current game group and I can only play Catan and Stone Age so often.  Even with all its flaws, it will marginally improve my game day experience.  

I also want to thank [user=CleverMojo][/user]
The service was truly great, and the quality of production is fantastic for a first game.  Even though the gameplay hasn’t yet resonated with me, it’s a game I’m proud to have on my shelf.

Dice add a nice random element to the worker placement mechanic and the omission of a phased approach of "Place all your workers, now remove all your workers, person to the left becomes first player" god awful mechanic was an excellent design decision.

Maybe I was looking forward to this one a little too much and expected more as it fell a little flat for me. You could be rolling the dice but find yourself not having that many options open to you.

With three or more, this game doesn't work for me as I'm just not into bash the leader games. With two it's interesting initially as each turn you roll the dice and between them, your alien tech, and your colony bonuses, you try and figure out just how much you can accomplish this turn in your quest to land more colonies.

Unfortunately, after three games of that, I felt like I had seen all manipulations and that ceased to be fun.

Had the opportunity to play a 4-player and 2-player game of this back to back (I won both :D) and it is a great game that reminds me of Dominant Species for the worker (dice) placement aspect and the Dominance cards (alien tech cards)

Also it reminds me of To Court the King as you combo your tech cards with your die rolls for some sweet manipulation.

Can't wait for more plays of this!

Very generic worker placement die manipulation game. I found basically no space for clever play. Very few interesting choices in the game. Build up dice, get some dice manipulation cards, get your guys out there. Done. Color by numbers.

I love the Kingsburg-ish mechanic of dice allocation, and the classic sci-fi theme fits well. I'm excited about playing again. Another positive thing is that it's a game I've thought a lot about after playing.

On the downside, there's nothing for non-active players to do at all. Also, I didn't care for the last couple turns, as each player has to actively dethrown the current leader before the end. The Agenda expansion in the Factions fixes this perfectly though.

Quite unique dice mechanics. I like that there is always at least something you can do, so rolling 6's isn't always the best. I don't think it's a true area majority game like some claim. The scores always seem to be close in this game.

A small complaint is that you cannot really plan your turn in advance at all as you don't know which dice you are going to roll, but really, that's the charm of this game, and, as said, there is always at least something you can do.

A "dice placement" game, which is a nice blending between "dice rolling" and "worker placement" mechanics.  A game that inherently works around the problem of randomness by giving each player multiple opportunities of making the best use of each die roll.  There is also a great "screw your opponent" type of factor whereby you can shut out your opponent from making important, critical decisions.

OK Dice rolling game.  Doesn't compare with my favorites (Troyes,Stonehenge,Yspahan) but definitely worth playing again.  The choices are minimal at times, but can be difficult at times also.  The screw your neighbor factor is pretty high.  I really like the Raiders Outpost screwage in this game (hoping for/against the straight) but don't care much for the blocking (removing the mitigation of the random dice).  Then again, I was stuck in an situation where I could not gain ore for several turns in a row and one turn where the only thing I could do was collect sun fuel with all my dice, and all I needed was one ore to get off the colony track.  Don't like the 8 resource limit (seems unnecessary) and don't like that there isn't a really inefficient way to get a resource if your stuck.

Not quite as good as I expected unfortunately though it is innovative and thought provoking. The mechanics are solid, and the game play is sufficiently diverse and interactive to have you coming back. It seems to me that this unfortunately has a limited shelf life and I can't see it as a buy.

Best dice placement game I've played (except maybe for Waggle Dance). Very competently designed, has a bit more player interaction than you get in some worker placements. Early game feels like an efficiency race, but late game turns into a pretty nice area control fight, especially with more players. It's kind of lacking with 2, but 3 players might be the sweet spot. Probably one of the games I'll suggest first for a 3-player game.

Clever and pretty but quite tedious. Also, the highly regarded player interaction consists of blocking spaces your opponent needs (standard worker placement stuff) or a quite annoying "Ooh, I've rolled 3 of a kind, I can steal your resources" action. Brilliant.

I love the art and theme, first of all. It plays fast and furious. All the elements are here for a fine game. The die-rolling makes me nervous as I feel myself being taken out of the decision-making process to some extent. But then the Alien Tech cards counteract the randomness of the dice, giving a player more control over what is happening (if energy is farmed and spent to power the cards and so forth).

After a few plays the game has proven itself to scale well. I'm really digging this one.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
The game is ok. It starts off fun, but it often over stays its welcome. I am close to hating the experience by the end of each rare play.

There are two problems:
1) It lends itself to a lot of AP. As there are a lot of ways to manipulate dice/resources, a player can go about things in multiple ways. Since a player can't plan their move before their turn, it becomes very boring.

2) The Raider's Outpost can lend itself to a runaway leader problem. The first person to get additional ships can use the outpost to keep other players struggling while slowly moving themselves forward. I am tempted to take a black marker to it.

bgg auction, I enjoy this game.  It's kind of fun, though it does not make it to the table often.  The dice drafting aspect is what I like most.  Update, I've found other games that do the dice drafting better, with better theme, that I enjoy much, much more.  Kingsburg and Marco Polo.  Marco Polo is fantastic.  Will probably trade Alien Frontiers off now.

Likes: A unique use of dice for a worker placement game. The different alien techs and orbital station choices help to mitigate poor rolls. Also, 6's are not necessarily better than 1's (though most cases they are).

Dislikes: Even with the die manipulation and all the different choices available, there are strong rolls and weak rolls. There's also that classic race to get more workers thing that is just repeated in worker placement games.

I still can't decide how I feel about this one. Pretty quick to learn. I like trying to manipulate the dice to get what you want.

Played one game and I liked it very much. Quite luck-dependent, but forming a strategy is possible. I went the Terraforming route, managed to get to a point where rolling one 6 in 4 dice would win me the game. I didn't roll it (it's almost equivalent to a coin flip), but that didn't stop me from enjoying the whole experience.

UPDATE: I have to bump this up to an 8 after playing again. It's surprisingly strategic for such a luck-driven game. I might end up buying this (and the expansion now looks even more tempting).

Good combination of a worker placement game, dice rolling and area control. Not too heavy or long with a fair amount of depth and strategy involved (particularly with the factions expansion). 

12-4-13. Downgraded slightly. I don't think this game has the staying power I had hoped. I have played a number of times now and don't feel excited about playing again. I played Mission: Red Planet recently, and at the moment I think I would like to play this again (as an area control space game) over Alien Frontiers. My experience of Alien Frontiers may have been soured by a couple of very long games - the length of Alien Frontiers does work against it.

A fun worker placement using DICE???  Oh, yes!
First play was 2-player and it was fun.  Not as fun as Kingsburg, however.  It probably just needs additional play time and with more players.
Much better with 3-player!  Upgraded from a 7 to an 8.  We'll see if it's best with 4.
Something about this game makes my gaming group want to play Stone Age instead.  WTF?!?  I love this, but can't get it played enough.
Actually... I don't love it.  I like it.  But the initial passion is gone.  Not sure if something's missing and I should try the the expansion with the factions.  I don't care that much.  For Trade.

Classroom Copy - End game problems make it possible for the game to drag out far longer than it otherwise should.

In the mean time, they didn't have enough dice left to do much of anything themselves.

Space themed area control with the incorporation of a dice placement mechanic. It didn't quite live up to the hype for me as it fell a little flat with 2 players - there was not enough competition for territories. It was a bit long with four players, 3 players is the sweet spot. 

Has a bit of a Settlers feel, but definitely different games.

After 5 games: initially quite good fun however this game's novelty wore off quite soon. Artificially tight in the end game, so tight that the outcome depended on a single die roll. I know it is a dice game but with the limited and obvious choices the game presents you may as well just roll a die at the beginning and let the high roller win and then play something else. Good components but overall game let down by limited gameplay (and yes it plays better with the expansions but a game should play well without extra £ expansions). Ebayed.

My first dice placement game and one which I still love to this day. It has sufficient crunch, speed and escalation that keeps the game constantly tight and on edge, yet not too fast. Space and sci-fi themes used rather well, and the the excitement completing the right combo when rolling your dice is amazing.
I like this game a lot.

RATING: 5
This was an interesting game that is worker placement but your workers are dice. Depending on what your dice rolls are, you can commit dice to different areas to accomplish tasks, like getting more dice or acquiring resources or settling. The sci-fi theme works but isn't too heavy, which for me is good because I don't care much for space type games on the whole. I only played a 2 player game but it was decent. It wasn't something that I would get myself but if someone had it in their collection, I'd be fine with playing a couple times a year.

This is a great game.  There is not as much randomness as one might think regarding a dice driven resource game.   There are so many options on player turns that just about any roll can advance your game.

This game plays just as well with two, three, or four players, BUT the plethora of turn choices will drive those prone to analysis paralysis nuts, and the game can drag while said AP person takes a turn.  

I have threatened to introduce a turn timer to speed the game along, although I haven't tried it yet.

Nevertheless, a fantastic game.  One of our favorite as a two-player.

Look, I'm not saying that this game prevents cancer like some sort of cardboard anti-oxidant.  I'm just saying, can you really afford to take a chance and not play this game?

It perfectly blends Eurojunk games (worker placement!  area control!  passive-aggressive competition!) with Amerigarbage (take resources for the other player!  blow up their ships!  roll so many dice!) in a way not seen since NATO.  The eurowuss parts of the game enable a sane, clinical analysis of the problems at hand, but will often be unable to actually fix anything without calling in the ameridrunk parts of the game to unilaterally blow up everyone's plans, send them back to the stone age, and drunkenly wander off singing to itself.  So much fun, but probably keep it to 2-3 players.

RATING: 3
Another "choose what to do with your dice" game.  Only it is scifi!  I bet I would love it.

Turns out I was wrong.  I may have been incredibly unlucky or maybe this game is as incredibly broken as it seems but I got unlucky just a few turns in a row and fell so far behind it was impossible to catch up.  Basically, once other players have more ships, it blocks more things which makes it harder to get the ships yourself and harder to get as many points as they did when they first had the extra ships.  Adding luck to such a crucial worker placement mechanic of getting more workers should be seriously rethought.

Edit: Played it a second time with the correct rules. Still don't like it. I hate the end game and the way the scoring works. Also, you cannot really adapt to your dice since you should be building to optimize on one strategy so despite tons of ways to mitigate the dice rolling, it still feels like mostly luck. Way too long for what it wants to be, let alone what it is.

You lead a corporation colonizing a new planet.  To do so, you'll need to mine the nearby asteroid belt, gather some solar rays from the nearby satellite array and occasionally crash a spaceship into the planet and tell its inhabitants to suck it up, plant your flag and start farming potatoes.

Interesting Mechanic: Aggressive Dice Placement.  Alien Frontiers is a dice placement game, similar to Kingsburg, which is coming. =)  However, this game varies in Kingsburg in a couple of ways.  The first is that it looks more at patterns of dice - straights, or three-of-a-kinds for examples, which makes more dice viable on a given turn.  But the second is more aggressive.  There are only about 8 locations to place your dice, but multiple people can place their dice there.  However, there are a limited number of slots, and the dice rolls may block your opponents -- you can only mine if the die you are placing is equal to or higher than all other dice already placed.  

This core mechanic makes for a quick-moving resource management game that still has a lot of player interaction, which is to say, don't hoard your resources, or they won't be yours for very long.

Wish I had gotten in on the Kickstarter Campaign for it.  I got in under the preordering for the 2nd printing, and very glad I did.  Once it hit the table, I knew my money was well spent.  Being only into board games for the last couple years, finding a worker placement that works off of dice rolling for placement feels exciting.  Four players is where we usually sit when playing, not that I wouldn't play at two or three even, but the game has such simple rules and interactive play; that getting four people to play is the least of my concerns for it.  I've had hardcore and even very casual gamers (My friend Amanda comes to mind here) show great interest in playing.

The only downside I see to the game in its current state and in my mindset are the cards.  I could see after more shuffling the wear that will appear on them, but you won't see me sleeves these cards.  Fantastic Game.

Components: Attractive board, with mostly sensible icons on the various space platforms. The artwork on the cards is great. I wouldn't mind dice that are somehow also shaped like spaceships.

Experience: Hmm. At first, I was loving it. All the dice-rolling, always something interesting to do with my dice. But after ninety minutes of slowly carving out a place for myself in this alien world, I became weary of how easy it was for my opponents to hose me. Capricious dice are one thing, but opponents toying with my fate is another. 

Now, after a second play, it's not the capriciousness that bothers me, but the looong downtime between turns. Assuming each of my three opponents takes just 2 minutes to play out their turn (optimistic), I'll be sitting with nothing to do for six minutes at a stretch, with no way to plan my next move. That's way too long.

It has such a great central mechanism, but two hours (for the shorter game) is just too much, with too much empty space, for me to want to play this again.

I like the general game play.  However, toward the end of the game, player turns take to long due to all the pip manipulation going on.  Since you don't even see your dice roll until your turn, you can't really plan ahead.

Sound design that hasn't really grabbed me or excited me. I know a lot of people love this game -- apparently, more than I do. I'm glad to own a copy, but if given the chance I would almost always select Kingsburg (with full-on expansion) over Alien Frontiers for a given Game Night. Also, at a higher level, the more complex Troyes just crushes all over this game. (I'm a big Troyes fan.)

As a playtester who works with the game designer, Tory, I get to play this game at least once a week. We have a blast and, for the last few weeks, we have been playing the final production copy Tory received. 

As a supporter on Kickstarter I have a copy on preorder. I am very impressed how the original painted artwork, the professional icon graphics and the solid colored dice manage to come across without clashing or distracting the player. The painted artwork is in mostly dark and muted colors. The icons and text are bright colors with sharp edges so they float above the realistic artwork. Finally. The solid colored dice are large and in colors that stand out so they are easy to locate at the beginning of your turn when you need to gather them and roll. 

We meet to play games almost every lunch hour during the week and AF gets played about 2-3 times a week. 

I cannot wait for my copy to play it with my family!

I am not very good at worker placement games, and of course Alien Frontiers is no exception. But I love it anyway! I think that the dice results place interesting limitations on your actions per round, and I find it incredible that the game is designed so that even crappy rolls can make progress on any given turn.

As advertised, Kingsburg the way Kingsburg should have been done. The big difference is choosing Alien Artifact cards to give you additional latitude in how you use your dice. My only nit is that the die you gain from Burroughs is clear and thus hard to read - a black die would have worked better, but that's something you can always add in yourself and it's a very minor nit.

Very impressive game design. Lots of decisions to be made every turn, but the game plays fast. The dice add a random element to the game, yes, but the decisions made with the dice rolled are purely strategic. Scoring remains close throughout, particularly in a 2 player game. My wife loved it as well, despite having no interest in Sci Fi. Recommended.

Alien Frontiers is a great game.  The 'take that' part of the game is definitely there, but it's done in a way where it minimizes hard feelings.  Blocking spots on the board is part of the strategic process more than it is just a way to screw someone.  The rules are very straight forward, and after one play you should have all special cases worked out.  There is a bit of luck with respect to which alien tech cards come up first for each player, but it does not take away from the fun of the game. It is worth a play for you to decide for yourself.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
I love worker placement games and this is a great one.  Mostly because it allows new players to compete with people who know the game well.  You can still strategize to a great degree, but the element of chance that exists with the dice in the first half of the game keeps everything well balanced all the way to the endgame.

One downside, however, is how easy it is to make meaningless all of your hard work when you lose your first place lead to a couple of hard attacks from other players in the last few turns.  Kingmaking, anyone?

I treasure the well-crafted way the game turns dice into workers and forces you to compete for the best placements to adapt the randomness of your dice rolls into resource-creation for area-control competition.

Best dice placement game I've played (except maybe for Waggle Dance). Very competently designed, has a bit more player interaction than you get in some worker placements. Early game feels like an efficiency race, but late game turns into a pretty nice area control fight, especially with more players. It's kind of lacking with 2, but 3 players might be the sweet spot. Probably one of the games I'll suggest first for a 3-player game.

One can be stunned by the faboulous artwork of this game - the retro sci-fi of the fifties, and also by a neat system of dice allocation.
However, all the randomness that comes from the dice throws (can be too hard punishment in this game), as also by the "stealing" mechanic allowed and the chaotic powers of the cards, all result in a game where a player, not only plays against the others, but also against all odds, with very few chances of planning anything at all.

RATING: 6.5
Excellent theme with well-integrated mechanics.  Interesting use of dice to conduct actions.  My only gripe is the AP inducing cards that allow you to manipulate the pips on the dice.  In addition, the overpowered Raiders space almost forces you to "use or lose" your resources during your turn or else another player will steal them.  This causes even *more* AP, as players will spend minutes trying to figure out how to use up their resources, rather than save them from turn to turn.  Overall, though, still a fun game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Great quality dice, components, and art. The gameplay is rather lackluster as the dice almost play themselves due to how obviously powerful spaces are versus others. Certain cards are much more powerful than others as well. Between turns can be slow while several players roll and place their dice while you wait for your turn. You can interact with others beyond just blocking spaces but attacking others just prolongs the game. Might be worth it if they have a powerful card.

Base game feels like a next step dice worker placement game.

In Alien Frontiers you assign your dice "ships" to various colonization activities above a planet. Collect energy and ore resources in order to build new ships and colonize the planet. Obtain cards to manipulate the game (and other players!).

This barely makes a '7' rating because it plays so quickly. It's fun, but wildly random and chaotic. After so many good dice games recently (Troyes, Kingsburg, Castles of Burgundy...), I sort of expected this one to not be so luck-dependent. Still, because it is such a fast-paced game, it's worth playing.

Yet another dice management game: a couple of clever new ideas, lots of already seen tricks.

Major issues:

1) it is too long (it should be at least 30 minutes shorter)
2) There is too much bash the leader in the final part of the game, which is also slowed down by some AP, due to the fact that everyone has almost the same score throughout the game.

The game is solid, but can bog down with AP.  There's not much to do on other players' turns since you don't know your die roll until your turn begins.  Contrast with Kingsburg in which you get to squirm and recalculate with each move your opponents make, keeping you engaged on other players' turns.

This is a more interesting game than is Kingsburg, but the downtime takes a lot of the fun out of the game.  If your group plays fast and loose, this game is a blast; if not...stick with Kingsburg.

What makes worker placement games fun is setting up cool combos, and this game has that in spades. The different worker locations are nicely balanced, and the cards and special territorial abilities offer a nice level of chrome. There's just enough player interaction to keep things interesting -- this is definitely not serial solitaire.

Note that the base game is really good, but the Factions expansion ups the ante spectacularly.

RATING: 5
Dice plus action selection in space. It's not terrible, but it seems that certain actions are always better than others. Which means the game then boils down to turn order and good die rolling, rather than any particular strategy you decide on. At least it's fast.

I'd play it again if pressed, but it just wasn't my cup of tea. So far only [i]Troyes[/i] has succeeded with me using these mechanics.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
I really like this game at the start. Roll some dice, place them as workers, get resources or place influence in areas, pass the dice on. But then your abilities increase so your turn takes longer to work out. Players get action cards which can easily screwover the peceived leader. The games starts to drag out with significant downtime and victory becomes dependent on keeping your head down and hoping no one notices you edging for a win. Ultimately, its far too long to be an enjoyable die rolling fun and too "take that" to be a good strategy game. Nice ideas though.

Yep, this one took a tumble after a few more plays. Even though it's short, it can drag on and feel like random dice rolling. We'll see where it goes from here.

[November 2014 - 7.8]
A good dice-rolling, role selection/worker placement game. There's almost always something you can do, yet you still have the ability to block your opponents. As many have said, getting your extra ships in play early seems to be the key, and if you're blocked from doing so early, it can put you at a disadvantage. Only played two-player so far, so will need to see how it goes with more. Beautiful-looking game, more fun and easier to teach than something like Puerto Rico. That being said, PR will probably have the edge on replayability.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
In my game collection, this and Troyes add dice to the game in ways that are highly appealing. The ability to affect the dice if you plan ahead with appropriate card play and resource collection means you aren't entirely at the mercy of the luck of your roll. Always a favorite at our table.

After playing Alien Frontiers a few more times, I have to adjust my rating. Just as I thought, the direct negative player interaction that is featured in this game is not really my cup of tea. It's not so bad that I wouldn't play Alien Frontiers again, but given the choice, I'd always prefer something else.

This doesn't mean that I think Alien Frontiers is a bad game, far from it. If you don't mind, or even enjoy direct negative player interaction, give Alien Frontiers a try since it's a rock solid design.

[2012-10-25 Rating: n.a. -> 7]
Alien Frontiers (AF) was a game that was on my wish list for quite some time. What kept me from buying it were the comments about leader-bashing and king-making. I don't like my games to be decided this way. So I stayed away from it. Lately, I got the chance to try AF (2 players). In this configuration, I really enjoyed the game. 

There are quite a few ways to use what you've rolled and with the help of some Alien Tech cards, your options do increase in later rounds. You even have that fine line between scoring and advancing your engine. If you get distracted by all the shiny Tech cards, you might be too far behind in the race for points to win. If you underdevelop your engine you might be stuck with what you rolled and lose a turn which is bad. Balacing these two factors needs makes your turns and the game fun.

But there are also some things that I don't like that much. As I read, the screwage factor is quite high in AF and I guess kingmaking will become a problem with more than two players. So, my rating is for AF with two players only until I've tried it with more players.

Another thing to keep in mind: This is a dice game. So there's certainly some luck involved. Rolling doubles in the beginning is great and you might get behind if you can't get the dice you need to start your engine. If you're looking for a game in which you can formulate a plan and execute it, stay away from Alien Frontiers. This might get even worse with more players as I anticipate a lot of player induced chaos on top of the luck of the roll.

RATING: 5.5
I should give it another go, as I did like the art and theming - but there are just a few too many elements to teach here for how short the game will in fact be.  More to the point, there are too many weird powers being acquired around the table (both off the planet and from the tableau of cards) to keep track of who's currently capable of doing what.  In a longer game you could sink your teeth into all that and compose a strategy revolving around several cards working together, but this whizzes to a conclusion just as you're starting to get something going.  Meh.

RATING: 6
Alien Frontiers is an Worker Placement game / Area Majority game (reminds me of Belfort in this respect).  Dice are rolled to determine your legal plays each turn.  There are some interesting synergies and decisions to be made regarding when to "purchase" extra dice, and when to discard them in lieu of points.  There is also an interesting interplay with getting resources which could get stolen, or moving forward in a sure manner.  All in all, this is a fairly tight game, but it's not something I enjoy playing that much.  I'm not sure why.  Somehow the theme doesn't come through for me.

Wow, don't judge a book by it's cover - what a game! I never thought to play it because of how ugly the cover was and now I regret it. I wish I played it sooner. 

Things I like about the game: The components are lovely; There are so many different ways to win; I love the little score tracker. I wish other games came with something like that. It makes it very obvious who's currently in the lead. It's a simple addition, but I like it; The use of dice as space ships... and I'm sure there are other things I'm forgetting, but nevertheless, give the game a shot, because it's very, very good.

This game is excellent!  It is very balanced and strategic despite the use of dice.  There is always a way to use the dice roll to your advantage.  I finally wound up trading it off as it grew into a cut throat style of game when it came to the area control, which isn't a bad thing, but my group tends to not enjoy that aspect of it.

RATING: 4
A nicely-designed game with a good look and clever ideas, but lacking in strategic choices.  It is a simple matter of optimizing your dice rolls without alternate paths to victory.  Even simple choices, such as which Tech to take or where to place a Colony, are only choices until you learn which are more powerful.

Alien Frontiers doesn't leave me wanting more.  I'd like to try with four players to see if it gets more interesting.

Didn't enjoy it.  Took way too long for what it was.  The AP killed it for me.  Also there is a serious 'take that' element to it.  One of those games where you need to try to appear weak so you aren't targetted.  Kingburg is much better and I don't especially like that one.

Good fun. Certainly not a hard game to teach, and the setup and take-down is pretty painless because of their clever deck-box setup. A game for two runs about 60 minutes, and it definitely keeps you struggling and involved throughout. My only serious issue I have with the game is the size of the box, which is easily 2 or 3 times the size that it needs to be, making it unnecessarily inconvenient to transport.

Players are colonists orbiting a distant alien planet, trying to colonize it.  Players on their turn roll their ships (dice) and allocate them out to tasks for the turn. Tasks include making new ships (more dice), gathering resources (ore and fuel), and founding colonies on the planet. It is all livened up by some chaotic alien powers which add a substantial take that element to the game.  The player with the most victory points (via colonies and majorities on the planet) wins the game.  It moves along fairly quickly, although can slow down with deliberate, careful players.  A lot of similarities to games we've seen before, but solidly developed and plays well.  Good presentation, nice game, but just no sparkle for me - I'd rather play Alea Iacta Est or Kingsburg, which feature a lot of the same stuff but in faster, more interactive fashion.   Alien Frontiers seems pre-destined to close finishes with the winner getting up by pure luck ... as if the previous 90 minutes didn't matter.

Very nice resource allocation game that looks like a dice game at first, but... While you play, you'll quickly notice that while rolling "well" is useful, knowing what to do with your dice is better still. Rolling high doesn't necessarily help you.

solid game, intuitive to learn, and nice colours and components. It makes a great gateway game if you want something a little more challenging than Settlers, as the decisions are often more difficult. There is a lot of bashing the leader though, and the end game can be anti-climactic as it often comes down to who gets the right roll at the right time to end the game. But then again there is a fair amount of skill involved as more experienced players seem to have an advantage, and the more I've played this, the more tricky end game moves I've seen with cards and switching control of territories. It will still be seeing lots of play I'm sure.

If you enjoy games where you have so many options each and every single turn, then this game may be for you. Great theme, excellent way to conceptualise dice rolling (they're ships)that I've found different to every other sort of dice rolling game. Highly strategical, and if you play with a timer - it forces quick thinking and decision making, which I find highly challenging/fun that as a bonus also quickens the pace of the game (which can drag out).

There is no strategy to be had here: you simply wait to see what spots are open on your turn and hope you get a good dice roll. The first player always has an advantage. The scoring system makes so that anyone can win at any point, if they get the right dice rolls. Boring, overlong, and lifeless.

RATING: 7.5
A light game of space colonization. Nice mounted map full of graphics accompanied by plenty of colored dice (one color for each player) and alien tech cards. The rules are very easy to digest, leave no ambiguities and game mechanics are simple as well. Each player tries quickly to place all of his colonies on the surface of the planet. First player to achieve this, play ends and each player scores his points to have a winner. It is a smooth fast paced game. The dice of each player are considered to be his space ships. Based on the results of each dice roll the player chooses what action will his spaceships under take. There is an abundance of choices: gather solar power, mine ore, construct and base colonies, raid others’ players resources, use the space market exchange or acquire alien tech cards to help you reach your goal. Lady Luck has her say all the time BUT the way you are going to use your dice/spaceships makes all the difference. Even an unlucky roll can give you benefits because of the very many options a player has, not including the Alien Tech cards which can alter the course of the game and the winner, significantly. After several plays the core game can become bland and repetitive. Adding one or more of the expansions or add-on can change all this and give more flavor to the game.

I won this from the Dice Tower!  It came with the space crane and everything!  Thanks Tom!  This will go great with my new Dice Tower dice tower :-)

It's fun to roll all these dice and allocate your "ships" to colonize the planet.  In general the game does a good job of mitigating the luck of the dice from taking over the game.  However, there does seem to be a little bit of a jam at the end were who ever rolls the six first to turn their ship into a colony will build the last colony and often win.  I need to play a few more times to see if this is a common occurrence.

I backed this game on kickstarter and so got one of the first copies (along with the Space Crane card and scoring rockets) and I am so very, very glad that I did.  I've played it 14 times since getting the game and for me it totally steals the show as far as dice based worker placement games go.  It's just so much more FUN than any of the others (and it's a subset of games that I am very fond of overall).  Brilliant game.

Some innovative ideas that don't work all that well in practice.   The game is slow, there's lots of downtime, and you really can't plan ahead due to the (innovative) dice blocking.   Alien Tech cards are very swingy and powerful, so you cannot ignore them.  Suffers from leader-bashing also, since the scoring is open and it is very easy to take points away from people.   So, there's some good ideas here, but it's an unpolished and under-developed game.

While a lighter worker-placement in my opinion, there's so much fun to be had in making use of workers as dice. The variety of spots makes almost any roll worthwhile, whether you're grabbing a ton of energy, blocking people off on the moon or just settling for some colony advancement.

I've had others complain that they were disadvantaged by poor dice rolling - as with any game with dice, you've got to not take the game so seriously. Even if this is a massive problem for you, pick up some Artifacts, giving you a lot more control over your dice faces.

Mainly played as a 2-player game so far. Very few games end up close, more often one player blows out the other. Just the way things are. We have been playing this one on an iPad recently, not having to set it up just to get destroyed is a nice touch. 

I'm hesitant to bring this one out for new players, I find they have trouble with there being so many different things you can do with their dice. Plus the rules explanation takes quite a while, so generally eyes glaze over before I'm able to finish explaining the whole game. 

However, My wife and I are enjoying Alien Frontiers immensely.

Véletlenül kipróbálva :-). Vagyis h Zs játszotta volna, de folyamatosan elhívták, már a kezdet kezdete előtt, és h a többiek ne várjanak beszálltam az 1-2 körre, amjd látva mit csinálok, azt mondta, ha már elb*-tam, akkor fejezzem is be. :-)
Komolyabban: na nem azért nem vetet vissza, rendes volt csak. 
Könnyedebb is lehetne, de nem annak szánták, jó ötletek, nekem picit hosszú volt. Illetve hát a kocka szerencse: az utolsó 3 körben egy jó dobással befejezhetem volna a játékot, s még tán meg is nyerem. Ehhez képest a dobások nem úgy sikerültek, lassan csúsztam vissza, végül így utolsó lettem.
Nem nagyon, de a pontok itt a nem nagyon kategória: a végeredmény: 7-6-6-5 pontok voltak. /Vagy 8-7-6-5?, mindegy: kevés pont/
Jól összerakott amúgy, jó választási és döntési lehetőségekkel, egyes területek megszerzése egyben egyes akciók -az adott terület melletti- megsegítése is: kevesebbért ugyanazt, vagy ugyanannyiért többet kap az ember, ha a területet uralja.
A rossz dobásokra is gondoltak: van egy szemetes hely, ami lassan telik meg de legalább van hova tenni a kockákat, és halad is vele az ember. Szóval aranyos játék, de nyelvfüggő, -bár ha nem használod a kártyákat akkor nem :-), ugyanakkor a kártyák azért nem rosszak. Igaz aki nyert sem vett rengeteg kártyát, de az az 1-1- lap is csodákat tehet.

I just can't bring myself to really like this game.  I like the dice as workers and the ways you use them on the different action spaces.  However, the steal action is way too powerful and also not hard to achieve, so there's a very good chance that all your resources will be gone by your next turn.  Playing with only 2 players helps this somewhat.  Also, have yet to play a game where over-taking someone in a region did not lead to bitterness.

My husband made an interesting comment to me after playing this game; "we keep falling for games that are sold as it's like a game we love".  This game was on my radar as being hyped as 'better than kingsburg' or 'kingsburg in space'.  Other than dice placement, I don't really see what alien frontiers has in common with kingsburg.  

I probably should have watched a review of this game because it has a mechanism I try to avoid; stealing points from your opponent.  That and some rather bad luck on my part of being limited to three ships until about the fifth round made this game not great.  Who knew rolling doubles could be so finicky?

I like how scores can bounce back and forth toward the end as people jockey for position and control of different areas. It makes for some really great tension.

Doesn't get played that much. Can sometimes outstay its welcome. What it did when it came out was fairly novel, but isn't so impressive now.

I love a good space theme, and this one has it, I also love rolling dice, and this game HAS IT. However, the endgame of this one is a bit of a let down, players end up within 1 turn of victory, so it's hard to feel like any strategy is a "winning" strategy. The regions on the board get especially frustrating when everyone fights for control. It comes down to the fact that I have better space themes and I have better dice games.

2015-08-10 : Very streamlined game with one of the best board layouts ever and great graphics. The only thing stopping it from becoming a "10" is that game turns become longer and longer as the game progresses due to the increased number of dice manipulation tech cards players can use. In other words : don't play this with AP players or with more than 3.

RATING: 7.7
The artwork is fantastic.  I like the space concept of the game. Unfortunately, It lacks depth and the game ends quickly.  The choices for where to place your ships seem to be too obvious. When would you not use a 6 to build a new colony if the space was available? The luck factor seems much to high. the game seems to boil down to rolling dice and making what feels to be an obvious and predetermined set of choices.  

I will probably only play with a group of non-gamers (younger nieces/nephews).  

My score is low because I assumed the game would have much for depth and replayability.

This one was a miss for me. This title has a decent theme and presentation, but the game is too long for what it is. I also didn't appreciate the downtime and AP that was caused by applying all your dice at once. I felt the cards were a little too powerful, too. The almost zero sum area control aspect of the planet was tedious. I would unfortunately rather play pretty much any of the other dice rolling euros that have come out recently. 

A second play of this was much more enjoyable than the first.

My new favorite dice worker placement game.  It can be mean, and has some somewhat mitigative chance elements,  but it goes quick enough and there's enough options and chance for retribution that the impact of these aspects are not horrendously crippling.

Tight area control, solid rule set, dice-worker placement with special powers in a hand painted retro space setting= Great game!

Meh...seems quite simple to me, which is a bit of a disappointment. Choices seem fairly obvious. The board is also quite open with only 2. The production quality is amazing though. Lovely bubble colonies, cool artwork, and very thoughtful to provide the tuckboxes - makes storing everything away very neat and convenient. So far though, a bit more flash than substance. Hoping that the Factions expansion comes my way so I can try it with that and see if it changes my impressions.

Great dice-optimization game combined with worker placement and majority control elements, as you optimize your resource in a quest to colonize a planet.

1 play - 7: good game, not what i was expecting.  Would play occasionally but it will never be in my top tier as it's not exactly my perfect style (due to the direct interaction competition elements).

2 plays - 2: oh god, what was i thinking? Clearly i didn't fully understand what was going on during my first play 4 years ago. So many things wrong (or should i say, that aren't my cup of tea) with this. Attack the leader. The lead randomly swings back and forth near the end. Kingmaking of course. Locations annoyingly blocked and unavailable the entire game if the same player takes it every time. Ugh, and there's probably more.

The game’s retro artwork was very attractive, but its retro gameplay was not. I’ve seen people comparing this to Kingsburg which I don’t understand other than they both have dice.  See, in Kingsburg, you place a die/dice, then another player, etc., until everyone has placed all their dice. Here, you place all your dice all at once. This means a player takes their entire turn at once while everyone else waits. 

For me, this game felt a lot more like Settlers of Catan than either KB or Stone Age. Just like in Settlers, people don’t know what the board will be like before it’s their turn, and they very well may have resources stolen from them during other players’ turns, so planning for most people begins at the beginning of their turn. While they decide what to do with their dice, you wait. In a 4P game as people get more of their ships (dice) into the game, the downtime increases and the game drags.

Alien Frontiers is a clever dice game that offers lots of options, mitigating somewhat the uncertainty of the dice rolls.  But ultimately it seems unsatisfying as much does hinge on the dice, especially who can roll doubles (to get extra dice) the quickest at the beginning.  

It also seems to bog down, especially with four, as the game advances and everyone tries to analyze the "best" options for the use of their rolls.  There is nothing to do while waiting your turn, and I find myself wanting to "advise" the other players what to do with their dice rolls.

The game that made me love dice assignment. The mix of dice assignment, worker placement, and resource management really sings. Simple to pick up and easy to teach. Expansions so far have been great. 

Edit: Newer expansions trickling out since this spring have been disappointing money grabs, or appear to be. Avoid. 6-23-15. Personally, I threw away the Faction Agenda cards as they slow down the game and add complexity without enjoyment.

Apparently I really like games that use dice as workers. Alien Frontiers is an excellent worker-placement game with dice. The theme, technology cards, and aesthetics make it one of the best games out there. Rocket dice really up the theme, too. It also scales really well to different player counts.

I like the central dice placement mechanic, but there's way too much downtime between turns.  Too many ways to manipulate the dice leads to AP and even more downtime. That said, this is an area-control game that I actually like and actually works well with two players.

Didn't get to finish our match, but enjoyed it enough. It is very like Kingsburg but the focus is the board, not your own building area. Lots of choices, always something you can do, but the game really turns on the extra abilities the cards give you, and negative inter-action. I was less bothered by this, stealing and blocking and so on, it was fun enough and there's enough chance to deal it back. 

Nice bits in the 4th ed, but really, still making printing errors?? On the whole, I liked it and will look to get a copy.

Not so great with two — the dummy mechanism, doesn't hold a candle to live players. At four players, the game is taunt and interesting; lots of meaty decisions to make. The game passes through very distinct stages as play progresses, having  discernible beginning, middle, and end strategies. We all sensed the depth here, ripe for the exploration of future plays. A great game, far more interesting and stressful than Kingsburg. 

Actually, I think the game has more in common with Stone Age than Kingsburg. 

I was afraid that the game would lack tension, but my concerns were unfounded. While I'm sure that surface players, shallow thinkers, and other forms of neanderthals could drag the game down, making it a chore, with the right players it's a real gem.

Nov 18, 2010 - upgraded to a 9.  The more I play this the more I want to play it.  The 2 player game is fast and cutthroat, the 3 player nicely paced and plotted, and with 4 it runs a bit long with that downtime you've heard about.  But just a lot of fun, very nice mesh of theme and mechanisms.

B&B/2011

Similar to other games that assign dice according to the numbers rolled, such Kingsburg, Alea Iacta Est, Troyes. 
Usually you have enough choices, and sometimes hard choices, to place your dice.  Nevertheless, it's an area control dice game that depends on good rolls.

Extremely well designed board, and attractive too, with nice components.  Simple rules & well-written rule book.

Game faster in the beginning, but can really bog down near the end when players have acquired more cards and bonuses. Cannot plan ahead because of a lot of stealing, and placement depends on your roll.

Board easily adapts to 2-3 player games.  In 3-4 player games expect a lot of leader bashing.

Simple strategy involves trying to get more actions. 

It is so simple to teach and to remember how to play (certainly helped by the great board layout), I think this will be an easy one to pull out, especially  when new players are present.

I am lukewarm about the dice, and I do prefer games where players can plan ahead so they can actually play when it is their turn.  When it is my turn and I throw the dice I tend to spend less time than I should considering options, because I don't like people waiting on me.

For what this game is, it needs to be shorter:
*Maybe give each player fewer colonies since the game ends when the last colony has been played.  Since that would reduce conflict, some territories should be randomly excluded.  
*Maybe limiting a player to two cards--a lot of time was spent reading cards that could be stolen, reading your own & trying to decide the order of play, and reading the 3 available cards.  
*Maybe only two cards (instead of 3) face up for purchase.  Would reduce the reading time.

If it were a shorter game, my rating would be higher.

10/10/10  I was planning on preordering Survive today, but then I panicked about shortages of Alien Frontiers and used my gaming slush fund on that.

10/17/10  I hope Alien Frontiers is all it's cracked up to be since I just math-traded Kingsburg away.  I'll find out tomorrow.

10/19/10  Game night started with Alien Frontiers. It was fun creatively turning a bad roll into a colony on the board and messing with each other.

10/19/10  Unfortunately, that made the game go long (>2 hours with 4 new players). Hopefully that will be reduced as we get used to the dice combos.

11/2/10  Played Alien Frontiers again, this time with 3 new people. Still took a long time, but still lots of fun!  Hoping the play time comes down.

11/30/10  Played Alien Frontiers (2p). Got an early dice lead, then plugged up the lunar mine and colony constructor for an easy win. 4p is more fun.

1/3/11  @ingredientx I understand the leader-bashing problem, but I still like it. They're looking at hidden goals for the expansion. Should help.

4/18/11  Played Alien Frontiers. Great game, lost on a fancy final turn combo.  #notatgof2011

The dice-placement is much more interesting than Kingsburg, and I prefer sci-fi over fantasy. It is also much more tactical - you only know the available slots on your turn - and extremely vicious. There's a lot of bash-the-leader so you don't want to be leading towards the end. However the cards, planet powers and build up of dice does allow combos even if the sense of progress isn't as strong.

The game really drags when people AP.

A solid dice placement game in the same category as Kingsburg. I love the theme of the game and the fact that the sectors of the planet are named after famous science fiction writers. But unfortunately the game itself is not that interesting, there is too little variation in the actions you can take and the area control part doesn't really work with 2 players.

The expansion helps make it a bit more interesting but I would still rather play Kingsburg.

Alien Frontiers turned out to be a very pleasant surprise. I'd heard the comparisons to Troyes, a game I've owned for a while now, and was always glad I had it instead, being as it's touted as the more "gamer's game" of the two. But Alien Frontiers turned out to be a lot more different from Troyes than I was expecting.  Area majority plays a huge part (one of my favorite mechanisms), and while having a lighter feel, it almost seems like there are more options on how to use one's dice in this one, especially when playing with the Factions expansion which we also tried this month. The artwork is great, the rules are pretty straightforward, and there are usually at least a few good options every turn.  It's a solid game, and I'm glad that I have both it and Troyes in our collection.

Yahtzee with a purpose. It's fun, a little heavier than you'd expect for a dice game/yahtzee style game.

I cannot believe why this game has only a slighly worse rating than Troyes, the latter imho being MUCH better. Mainly due to the fact that your action possibilities are much less restricted since you have access not only to your own but also to your fellow players' dice.

and since the action spaces are generally more limited as well, it can even be quite frustrating if you simply cannot take one action because it's permanently taken by the player in front of you.

This game is easy to learn how to play, but it is not easy to learn how to play well. There are so many different choices that I often feel "analysis paralysis" while playing it, especially with my boyfriend, who has a lot more practice with it than I do. I need to use the cards better; the "powers" they give you can win you the game. Also knowing which regions to take first makes a big difference.

Érdekes játék, még nem játszottam hasonló mechanizmussal. Kicsit olyan mintha a kockapóker találkozna worker placementtel. 
Valamiért a scifi játékok hangulatukban engem nem nagyon tudnak megfogni, így volt ez ezzel is, de a mechanizumas alapjaiban nagyon tetszett.
Az első játék gyakorlatilag sötétben tapogatózásssal telt. Ami lejött belőle: 
- nagyon nagy a kitolási faktor a játékba, és sajnos nekem erősen kingmaker szagú is.
- a szerencse szerepét képtelenség megbecsülni benne, mivel annyira el van rejtve. Talán nincs is benne olyan sok szerepe, szóval ez inkébb pozitívum.
- ahogy az embernek egyre több hajója/területe/kártyája lesz hatványozottan nő a kombinációk száma. Így rengeteg idő megy el a gondolkodással sakkozással, ami miatt nagyon sok a holtidő. A majdani dobásod ismerete nélkül előre gondolkodni nincs sok értelme, így mindenki uncsizik, amíg rá nem kerül a sor. Viszont a dobás után a nyakadba szakad kb. 100 kijátszható kombináció, amin természetesen még a leggyorsabb játékos is 3-5 percet gondolkodik.

Szívesen játszok még vele, mert ezzel a játékkal egy játék nem játék. Azért azt elsőre is éreztem, hogy nem ez lesz a kedvencem. 

Kíváncsi lennék rá, hogy 50-100 játékos veteránoknak mennyi ideig tart egy kör a végjátékban.

Alien Frontiers does many things right, but a few things wrong in ways that overshadow the rest of the design.

The basic dice management game works fine, although it is fairly one-dimensional because the only way to score points is to get colonies down onto the surface. The downtime for such a simple system, however, is excruciating. There is very little planning ahead because the situation can (and will) change completely until it's your turn. Docking ports will be occupied, your resources and cards will be stolen, your ships blasted from space, and of course there is the dice factor, too. This problem gets even worse as the game progresses because of the many technologies and bonuses that influence the game state (and I actually like many of the technologies).

Probably even worse than the downtime problem is the leader bashing, however. Alien Frontiers allows direct targeting of specific players, e.g. by stealing resources from them or destroying their property. This works as a great equalizer if one players sticks his head out too far. Everyone else will simply target that player until he has been pulled back into the fold. I'd rather have a run-away leader problem.

A fantastic blend of dice allocation, resource management and area control mechanics with inspired retro Sci-Fi art direction. A little bit euro, a little bit "take that" Ameritrash, which has good and bad points. The transparency of the publisher and their KickStarter story is very interesting too. Can suffer from Analysis Paralysis at the endgame [though hidden agenda cards from expansion helps this to some degree IMHO] and the Raiders Outpost makes this very confrontational, and there is a kingmaker issue occasionally, but the game is definitely FUN and one that gets alot more table time than most of my collection as a result. I teach this to non-boardgame-playing gamers alot and it goes over well.

After 2 plays, the newness of the game wore off on me a bit. I love how there is dice rolling, but the game has reduced the randomness heavily in all other aspects of the game (even card draws are drastically de randomized). I think the game will start to feel the same every time and should only be played sporadically it exciting. Compared to Troyes, this game is more accessible, thematically more suited to my tastes, has a feel of more decisions to be made, and less prone to deep thinking turns. Troyes has one key advantage over AF: exceedingly greater variability between games.

I found this game to be very aggressive for what is technically a worker placement game. The basic dice rolling and placing mechanisms are interesting but the area majority game can be very nasty especially since some of the tech cards are very powerfull. If you don't like getting completely screwed over from time to time this one isn't for you. If however you like this kind of tension I think it can be a great game.

"Oh god, not another worker placement game!" is the first thing I thought when I saw Alien Frontiers. Okay, the components are great quality and the artwork is EXACTLY what I look for in a space themed game. Alright, rolling dice, placing them where I think is best, getting resources and powers and then I get another die and geez that Mind Control Ray would be reallllyy nice right now and HOLY SHIT DID YOU JUST TAKE MY SUN ENERGY TOKENS?!?! Yeah, it was amazing how quickly I got into this. I'm always amazed how someone can take the worker placement mechanic and still make a fun game. Not a lot of interaction between players, but you have to keep your eye on everyone. Just like Caylus, the game starts off with a few choices and then nicely grows to more options. Really, this is a fun game, with a great theme, and some smart ideas to give the WP mechanic a nice coat of paint and a smooth-running engine! Bleep bloop blorp!

I like the theme, mechanically it is sound.  I don't like how long this game takes.  I have not sat in on or witnessed a game of Alien Frontiers that has lasted under an hour, and it needs to.  

The decisions aren't deep but there are many possibilities in the dice especially once you add cards that twist and turn their potential (which is cool).  However, if you play with even a slight APer you will be in for a very long ride.

It also feels like it needs slight more development to make the area-control element more exciting and to let the time involved feel right.

RATING: 7
Interesting blend of mechanics (Kingsburg-style dice combos, area control, resource management) that remains fairly lightweight with the rules.

This game fell flat with my multi-family session (4 players) and an intra-family session with 3 of us.

My son and I still appreciate it and want to play it some more, but the nickel-and-diming of victory points and the turnovers during endgame were a turnoff for almost everyone else.

I've had this one on my shelf for a while and I'm glad I finally got it on the table to play. Initially the game can feel a bit daunting with the many symbols on the board, but the game is quickly understood minutes in the first play through. Alien Frontiers shines in the fact that is offers the player many different decisions. Do I try to block my opponent's ships or do I want to gain another ship to be able to place next turn? While luck is still an important factor in Alien Frontiers, players must rely on their tactical decisions be able to establish colonies and receive victory points.

The largest issue with Worker Placement games is that players can feel like they are playing competing solitaire games. Alien Frontiers has the perfect amount of player interaction. The game is mostly focused on building up competitively rather than attempting to destroy your opponent. A close game can be satisfying for the winners and losers since it's not too cutthroat (though the raiders outpost can be an annoying tactic).

Overall, I'd definitely recommend Alien Frontiers.  
Pros:
- Easy to pick up
- Solid gameplay mechanics
- Fitting spaceship colonization theme
- Constant tatical decisions
- Ideal amount of player interaction

Negative:
- Generic game pieces
- Basic, but not necessarily poor art

Area control with the colonies and the propensity for stomping the leader and kingmaking should really turn me off of this game.

psuedo-worker placement mechanic with dice, similar to Kingsburg.  Some cards and territories add variable powers.  The game bogs down towards the end due to the fact that the only player who will want to end the game is the one who can finish with the most points.  Others will have no choice but to pick on the leader and delay the end as much/long as they can, potentially kingmaking in the process.  I've never cared much for this type of phenomenon, so I've downgraded this a point or so in my rating.  Others may actually enjoy the competitive dynamic of a more drawn out and wild finish.

Very good game based on a solid and well tested use of dice combinations.
One little drawback in my opinion is that there are actually not that many choices to be made each round. Very often, the allocation of your dice is pretty much dictated by your current situation/immediate needs. Feel it sometimes plays in automatic mode. But it is good and certainly worth a try.

First play impressions -- certainly not bad, but I'm not sure there's much to do here. I was surprised at how little "build-up" there is to the game. It looks like it should be a little engine-building game, but I'm not sure it is. Winning seemed to be more about finding little combos of dice and alien powers. Lots of alien powers means lots of text to read and work through, a little too much for a fairly light game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Not bad. Not bad at all. Everything including the space theme really works, however I feel that it's probably more tactical than strategic. There is a lot of blocking and 'screw you' mechanics which I am a big fan of; yet whenever my turn came up I felt like my choices were a bit limited. A few things that I did NOT like: Finding a way to push people from blocking the lunar mine! There should be a few more ways to destroy somebody elses colonies as opposed to just moving/swapping them. (Though, it keeps the points race close.) The first few turns are ALWAYS going to be a ship-building race. There's not much incentive to do anything else...

Call it what it is...Yahtzee in space. And it's awesome. Ok...it's more than that...plenty of options and card combos to mitigate the dice - and plenty of "take that!", so it's not multiplayer solitaire (like Yahtzee). 

You can't play nice in this game either - well, if you do, then whomever gets more dice will usually win. You need to constantly be removing dice from the board (plasma cannon), and eliminating the usage of territory powers (Isolation Field Generator) - and seeing how moving colonies can cause other players to lose points and powers! 

You can't be afraid to use the "discard power" of the cards. Use 'em!

Plays quickly (can be prone to AP, but this tends to go away after a few plays) - great game!

I love the components, I like how fast it plays and how it feels like a race. I think the raiders are too powerful, it swings the game pretty wildly, but it's still the best in its genre. I think there's plenty of ways to mitigate rolls and there's a lot of competition for the spaces on the board. I like how the deck has a lot of duplicates, that means that you won't be screwed by bad draws. The points for domination make sense, but it causes very swingy point shifts and the first person to place all of their pieces will probably win, so why even have points?

It has dice rolls, and plenty of them, so the luck factor is there.  But the game is effective in what you do with what you got, and the game is, interestingly enough, balanced in terms of the luck factor each player gets.  But at the same time, it is possible to get some terrible dice rolls that don't give you as many opportunities as you need.  But from my experience, it's not a game breaker.  This is one of the few games that manages the luck factor in a nice controlled way.  It's worth at least 1 play to see how you would enjoy it.  In terms of luck vs. skill, I would go for about 60-40 in favor of luck, which is quite an accomplishment for a game relying on dice rolls for gameplay.  I guess it's because the gameplay is fun, and there's many ways to win which allows you do adapt to any dice roll you get.  It's not perfect, but it's still fun.

RATING: 5
Impressive physical production, both attractive and ergonomic. I like the cards, which allow for some interesting tricks in an otherwise straightforward game.

My principal criticism of Alien Frontiers is that it moves too slowly and lasts too long. To justify its current pace and length, there would need to be more stuff to do, and there would need to be a more interesting game arc from beginning to middle to end. The downtime is especially annoying because you can't plan anything until your turn begins. Other games in this genre solve this problem by letting you roll your dice in advance (Kingsburg, Troyes), or by allowing you to do only one thing at a time (Alea Iacta Est, Airships, Kingsburg, Troyes). The turn structure of Alien Frontiers is a real weakness when compared to these competitors.

A dice placement game, which focuses heavily on that. Every turn is a little mathematical puzzle, which starts fairly simple and grows as the game progresses (alien cards, zone abilities).

Feels like Settlers in the scoring system. The game comes down to trying to stop who is in the lead and about to win the game. And since 1-2 points is so important, it is quite easy to prevent a player from winning. And since there are very few ways to score outside of placing colonies, once your colonies have been targeted and your majorities stolen, there isn't much you can do. I really wish the scoring system was different. This is where I felt that Troyes was the much better dice Euro of the year.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is another game about manipulating dice in various ways. You roll a few dice and place them on different spots on the board which gives you either resources, more dice the following round, special cards or make you able to put out colonies on the board. The goal of the game is to have the most points which are usually archived by having colonies on the board.

There is some take that added to the game by one of the spaces (which let you steal resources or a card) and some cards. The good thing about that is that the game feels more tight and tense, but it also leads to a bash the leader/kingmaker problem where someone can sneak up from behind when other players are fighting.

RATING: 2.1
I was convinced I like this game, but:
Noticable downtime in a four player game, almost over the threshold of "I got bored waiting" as you cannot prepare your turn.
My impression of the game was mostly influenced by the following: there are "big" dice games where you can mitigate poor dice rolls (for example Kingsburg or even Bora Bora). In AF however not. In the beginning of the game you need doubles to get you more dice. If this is not possible you´re screwed. Alternatively you will get resources instead. A lot of resources makes it probable that they will be stolen, which is another remarkable set back. Both happened to me and while I was still on 3 dices other players already got the max amount of 6. Poor dice rolls and being victim of the Raiders = horribly unbalanced game. Even when I rolled a double then the shipyard was occupied with other players dice...
One should not be allowed to steal 4 resources of the same player. Nor should it be possible to steal the only alien tech card one possess. Rather this ability should be bought first (in form of an Alien Tech card, so it comes into play but later) instead of being allowed right from the start.
Even if a fourth player gets two resources as compensation of the disadvantage I didn´t get use of it because of being robbed. So the only verdict I can decide on this game (out of the box) is broken. Maybe it would work with "kind" fellow players, but they aren´t.
It has a cool theme and lots of nice ideas but the overpowered raiders outpost ruins the game.

Mojo games policy stating they will not ship to non brick/mortar retailers really ticked me off. These retailers opened their arms to Mojo games and promoted the game resulting in the 2nd edition printings and Mojo games turns their back on the people that helped them.

1.) Sit back and watch the situation evolve until your turn

Q.) How can I rate this so much lower than Kingsburg?

A.) Easy, this game suffers from over complication. Kingsburg does not try and mask what it is under unneeded layers.

2-4 Players.  This is a great puzzle solving game when it is your turn.  The problem is when it's not your turn you have little to do until you are able to roll the dice to determine your options and an optimal play.  Throw in a slower player or an "Analysis Paralysis" player and the game drags WAY too long and the fun factor decreases substantially.  Probably plays the best with 3 players to limit downtime.

Excellent retro sci-fi art is a big draw for me.  I like the dice mechanic as resources ( a little like Kingsburg).  The choices are initially limited by the roll of the dice, but as you aquire alien tech, you can modify more of your dice.  Then the limiting factor becomes more about spaces for dice.  You can't directly plan more than about a turn ahead since you don't always know what will be available, and you don't know your rolls beforehand.  Evenso, I like a tactical game just as well as any.  It's light enough you can talk and joke over the game without ruining it, yet it's no where near as light as any typical dice game.  

I'm very happy with the purchase and look forward to future plays.

A manipulative worker placement without standardized "rounds." Dice as your ships is done well in ways the game allows you to change the die face value. In turn, this will make other options open or change values of previous options. In addition, the scoring mechanism is a unique use of sliders that fluctuate throughout the game. All of this is on top of leaving your ships on the board after your turn. Full of interesting decisions, not horribly exciting, but a game worth playing.

Maybe the thrill is missing when playing alone, maybe 2 player isn't the best format for this game, maybe it's a little light for my tastes, maybe I'd have been better off with Kingsburg, or maybe I haven't seen the full potential of this game, but right now I rated it a 7 where really I should be rating it a 5.
---
A few more plays in of this one and I'm starting to regret my Kickstarting the expansion.  It's not a bad game design, but the downtime is the dealbreaker for me because there's just nothing to do when i's not your turn.  I've read some stuff on rolling at the end of your turn so when it comes time to place your dice there's less to decide, but even then...  Also, this one's just a little much for non game nerds, but a little light for gamers.

Best with 2 to 3 players, too slow with 4.  Rating may rise or fall with repeated plays, but is more challenging than originally thought.  Skeptical about the number of different strategies that can be employed as guided by foresight rather than as a tactical response due to dice rolls in the early/mid game.

For the record, dice and I are not friends. But, that does not influence my rating or review of this game. I approach AF with the same sort of masochistic foreboding that I do with other dice centric games. That is, prepared for doom on any given turn. However, AF is more like "Roll Through The Ages" in that 1) the dice can be used for multiple options not just a high/low sum & 2) the dice can be (legally) manipulated - in AF by using some alien tech card powers. This tends to moderate the impact of the actual dice rolls... but not completely... it does still have a bit of luck factor and if one gets behind in the colony placement race I've found it fairly hard to catch up in time. Still an enjoyable game when in the right mood. And I think it is susceptible to the usual balancing issues in 3 player games, so 4 or 2 are better. More of a building race with 2, more of a "king of the hill" with 4.
(Note, I have not recorded many of my plays of this game, as usual for me with any game.)

Many gamers discuss how Alien Frontiers compares to Kingsburg and which is the better game.  For me this is not the question: I love Kingsburg.  I love Stone Age and I love Alien Frontiers.  All three games use dice rolling, worker placement and resource collection, however with different focus.   Kingsburgs main focus is risk management because of the threat cards.  Stone Age puts the focus on it different pathes to victory points.  Both are typical indirect Euro-style games.  Alien Frontiers shares some mechanics with its older brothers but offers more interactivity and is slightly more aggressive without becoming frustrating.  I like how different combinations of dice can be used and how the dice go together with the alien tech cards.  Overall gameplay is quite smooth, and not as AP-prone as I feared.  Very recommended as advanced family game or light gamers game.

I will update this comment when My copy of the game arrives in march with my preorder materials. The game has aspect of stone age, but implemented with a such a cool theme.  It's style reminds me of the 1950's Tom Swift books.

RATING: 8
Very good game in the vein of "Kingsburg", but it feels a little heavier, and combinations of dice are more important than high numbers. Instead of constructing buildings with different abilities, you just get technology cards and some majority bonuses on the board, while victory points come from placing colonies.

There is a continuous game flow (instead of game rounds), where you do every step of your turn at once. That means you have no possibility of planning during other players' turns, as you must wait for yours to roll your dice and see which spaces are blocked, and that increases downtime. The low and tight scores would fit better in a system of the race type, either first to place all colonies or first to reach a certain score. I'm not fond of the "take-that" elements, either. Those may be very strong, particularly in a two-player game, and may favor bashing the leader or kingmaking with more players.

However, the game still has a lot of interesting choices. There are cards that allow you to manipulate the dice, reducing luck. The Sci-Fi theme is always a big plus with me, and the artwork is good enough.

Not sure I'm a huge fan of this.

I've heard people try and compare it to Kingsburg. I didn't get that feel.

It felt a lot like Roll Through the Ages to me.  So, there's an 'area control' part to it.  

Maybe because if the cities=rockets thing.  But, that's enough for me.  Build your [-]cities[/-] rockets in order to have a better chance getting [-]resources [/-]ore/fuel to get [-]developments[/-] territories that score you points and give you things that 'change' the basic rules to help you.

This is easily one of my favorite game. I have the 4th edition of this game and the production value is amazing. The board print quality is great and the colors are amazing. Components and espicially the tuck box to store everything is amazing.

The worker placement mechanics with the dice works well. You have Alien tech cards that help you modify your ships (dices) value to allow them to dock to the different space station you may need. Love the reference to well known Sci-Fi Authors on the board for the different section of the planet. The entire family love it and keep asking to play it more.

Using dice to manipulate multiple resources is a great way to bring randomization into strategy. The only knock I have on this is that the end game can drag and seems a little skewed to player order.

It's nice and pleasant--essentially a tweaking of Kingsburg. It feels like it is better balanced than the latter game, but has less nuance and less to do. I am also not such a huge fan of the lack of granularity in the scoring, which can compound the (admittedly rather minor) kingmaker possibilities. I would recommend Kingsburg with expansion over this, but only just.

The dice placement mechanic creates a fun puzzle every turn, you roll the dice and work out how you can manipulate and place them to advance you best this turn. The downside of this is that the game is largely tactical, you can make a few strategic decisions in what region abilities you go for but it is largely a tactical puzzle.

Enjoy this one. Have found some people don't like the fact they can get blocked out of actions and are limited where else they can go by the die results but I feel this can be mitigated by getting some of the cards/powers. Don't play with people who take things personally as I had someone go off at me because I moved one of their colonies.

I really, really, like this game. The only problem I have with it is that it has quite a lot of downtime between turns. You simply can't plan ahead and when it is your turn you'll have a lot of options making each turn take quite a while with the other players having nothing to do but to wait.

Fantastic game.  Very "smooth" gameplay, with a lot of nice screwage but some great limits on it as well.  You can hurt a person, but you can never outright destroy them, and I really like that aspect of it.  Great dice usage, and I really like how the game is more about using what you roll creatively, rather than feeling pressured to simply "roll high".

Outstanding production quality, smooth gameplay, and welcoming rules just make this game a joy to play.

RATING: 7
This is a really cool worker placement dice game.  Reminds me a little of Kingsburg in a way.  You roll your dice, and no roll really hurts you, plus you can obtain cards that let you manipulate the die results.  Then you place the dice, ala typical worker placement, and try to colonize an alien planet.  Of course there are a lot more things to do, like build more ships, buy cards, collect resources, etc.  

This is a very solid game, and I think over time is going to get quite a following.  Its sort of a dice game for people that hate dice, because nearly no roll really hurts you, they just change your options.

Terrific game, that rare gem that is both fast, fun and engaging.  It is a dice game, and the way the dice are used is such that no matter what you roll, you will have several choices available.

I only have two caveats (thus a 9 and not a 10).  One is that if you do not get a spaceship early in the game, you are not going to win, and it is a matter of some luck when you get your first spaceship.  It is still fun to play, even if you are not winning, though.  The other caveat is that it can be bothersome to play with someone subject to analysis paralysis, as there are so many combinations for each roll.  Especially later in the game when there are more spaceships.

RATING: 8
Much like Kingsburg, Alien Frontiers has players rolling dice and then using them as "workers" which are placed on the board in different places for different benefits. The board does a good job of providing attractive options regardless of what you roll, but of-a-kinds, straights, etc. are often more beneficial. 

On the face of it, Alien Frontiers suffers from the same inherent problem that Kingsburg does: you can't really develop a strategy. You have to deal with the dice you roll. If you want to develop more ships quickly, for example, you may not be able to; you are at the mercy of the roll. And yet to eliminate this aspect would be to make every roll feel exactly the same, in which case you might as well be using workers instead of dice. The answer is the Alien Tech cards, which provide a way to spend minor amounts of resources and modify the dice in favorable ways. This is a good solution, and creates some tough choices about whether to spend resources for a slightly better roll, or take the slightly worse one and save resources for later. 

The early game is all about developing an engine, while the endgame turns into fighting to defend your colonies and cards from the other players. I like this highly interactive endgame, but it may catch some people by surprise in comparison to how the game starts out. 

Unfortunately, this endgame tug-of-war can have some kingmaker problems. The hidden goals (potential victory points) in the expansion would seem to fix this nicely, as it is otherwise a bit too calculable. Since each player has the power to end the game as it nears the end, there should be some incentive for players not to take the lead and immediately end the game. The hidden goals provide this incentive. Since the expansion also adds a 5th player, it seems like a must-have addition. It's a long game considering how samey each turn can be, but the overall arc of the game from development to combat is nicely realized. A solid game that jumps from a 7 to an 8 when played with the expansion.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Started out great but wore out for me over time as the same strategy continually worked for me. Lots of take-that in the endgame is a minus. Way too many cards require looking in the rulebook for the full details on how they work. Consistently being unable to get your extra dice can totally kill your position, although that generally doesn't happen too often.

Great little game, fast and interesting. The alien tech cards can be safely ignored in the first few games, but make a world of a difference. The mechanics are well thought-through and what I really love is that there is no such thing as a game round. Each player takes a turn, sure, but there's no end-of-round procedure, or (like there is in Kingsburg) a clear board at the start of each round.

RATING: 7.5
After reading the rules, thought it was similar to KINGSBURG, but this is NOT the case, as rolling higher numbers does not ensure you get better resources.

As player dice STAY ON THE BOARD between turns, it is possible to partially block, or affect the "cost" of playing a certain action.

Since what you rolled limits your available choices of actions, it makes it difficult to plan ahead, as all you can do is choose a general direction and hope things don't change too much until your turn comes around again.

Still, it is next to impossible to be blocked, as there are tech cards which have various powers that you can use, which allows you to bend certain rules, modify the die results, re-roll, etc.

I like the fact that you can make the game longer by playing with 8 Colony tokens per players.  My group found 6 tokens was just a bit too long, but after a few more plays, it should clock in the listed time.

Further, there is a 5th player expansion, which I may not pick up as it would make the game too long.  But the option will be there for those who prefer 5-player games and/or have more time to play.

All in all, a nice design which leaves enough decision making, where players are not cornered, but where there is still a good deal of luck (die rolling).  As I mentioned, this can be mitigated with the right cards and card combos!

The area majority on the planet, which gives you points and a special card/power if you have a majority, is simple, and seems to work fine.

The only negative aspect is the rulebook, which is missing a few important cross-references, and where some of the important rules should have been listed in bold and/or highlighted, so they could be easily referenced.

As an example, where it says that your dice stay on the table between turns, perhaps a little highlighting might have shown this to be a key rule of the game.

The Data Crystal exception regarding the Burroughs Desert should also have been listed under the Burroughs Desert section, else people would think that the Alien die will keep changing hands.  Actually, this puts more importance on the territory at the center of the board, where I would expect folks try to prevent a majority.

Looking forward to trying this again, now that we seem to have figured out all the fiddly details we missed on our first go.

Interesting take on dice/worker placement. While this game doesn't do anything that is mechanically innovative for its 2010 release, the way in which mechanics blend feels fresh and clean, and the space colonization theme is integrated meaningfully in both content and form (and the form looks great). Considering that this was a Kickstarter, I'd say that this is a huge success.

An ok worker placement thing where your workers are dice (like Kingsburg). You use them to collect resources, then turn the resources into colonies that you play on the board in a grab for territory. Throw in a bunch of gimmicky special powers and you've got the basic idea of the game. I'd say it also suffers from a pretty severe pacing problem. Strangely, the game ends suddenly and feels like it actually ought to be longer, but at the same time, I don't really want to play it any longer than it lasts. The game feels like it ends before it can reach some sort of climax.  I'd play it but never suggest it. Too bad, because there aren't enough good space-themed games out there. The designer obviously knows his sci-fi authors, so props for that, but the game is underwhelming for all its thematic trappings.

This game is not good, it's not bad either.. but like almost every other kickstarter not well balanced. (especially the pirates nest) But the kickstarter crowd doesn't care, wich is cool, who am i to tell them what they should like and what they shouldn't..

Rest of the game is pretty good.. artwork cool, theme cool, components cool.

But even for a dice chucking game, there should be ways for players with "bad" rolls to mitigate those.. 

For example in alea iacta est you always can do cool stuff with every of your dice.. not in this game, some rolls are just not worth anything.

Is it truly "hype" when a game more than meets your expectations?  Alien Frontiers is a fast action, dice-rolling, Catan on steroids, without so much dumb production luck, and with a lot more openings for creative turns. 

It never slowed down, except when I stopped to read the rules- even on a first solo play. Terrific game- not a grand strategic effort, but one where every turn seems to provide some opportunity, and sometimes fantastic ones. 

Can't wait to play it again. This one starts at 8.5- it may go down if I find things getting static or rote, but I don't expect that to happen. 

Probably not BGG top 10 material. But a terrific game for 4 (maybe a bit slow with more players)- way to go, Clever Mojo Games!

Note: Dropped to 8 after 15 plays; seemed overweighted at 8.25, but still a good (if not supercalifragilistic) game.

So not only was this a fun game, but it turns out to be very, very different to Troyes. Honestly, dice allocation is the only thing they have in common.

In this game you just do whatever the dice let you do.

I know that "downtime" is sort of in the eye of the beholder but I felt this had more downtime than its play length warrants. It is a bit of a toss up whether I like this or Kingsburg better.

Love the puzzling aspect of manipulating your dice and figuring out the optimal placements. There's also great player interaction with denying people spots. However, this same puzzling aspect makes turns very long towards the end of the game.

Brilliant worker-placement game with creative use of dice. Rolls will limit the options but they do not entirely restrict strategies. This keeps turns chugging along quickly because the rolls narrows which paths are available each turn but there are no pointless / helpless rolls. 

Brilliant example of a well-designed dice mechanic. This game does not use dice as a 'difficulty' setting. The dice funnels the turn-by-turn opportunities yet avoids the frustration of utterly bad rolls that too frequently grace Catan or Stone Age.

There is a lot to like in this dice worker-placement game.  The theme and art are fun.  The mechanics are pretty simple and thus it's easy to teach and get to the table.  The interaction is strong once players have purchased a few extra dice as you can block other players from actions entirely or set the price for other actions very high.

Really just Yahtzee in space, althought there are no rerolls unless you have the right Tech card. At least personal attacks are kept within reasonable bounds as you need a 'straight' to raid someone's supplies or techs. Likely to be a very close finish with the person finally limping over the line being the one who gets lucky at the end. Plenty of table talk, but not enough game for me.

RATING: 6
Fun game, the dice-worker placement is more interesting than Kingsburg and the game is far more interactive but also very nasty which is both good and bad. While it's fun to steal lots of other people's stuff, the problem for me in a game this nasty is that it's all decided by who can get others to bash the leader while they slip through unnoticed to win at the end.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is another game in the recent trend of "interesting dice Euros."  In this case, the dice can be placed in various parts of the board, not entirely unlike Kingsburg. What makes it more interesting than the latter game is the cards, which grant various abilities to players who use them.  It's probably not my favorite of its genre, but I'd like to play it again. The fact that any dice you roll are likely to be good for something is a definite plus. (1 play)

RATING: 8.5
The gameplay is interactive and at times mean. Making good use of the dice/ships means often skipping over something you'd really like to do in favor of trying to mitigate the behavior of other players.

The end of the game can come very quickly, so the tension ratchets up after the midgame on each turn.

My gripe about the game is the publisher and how expensive the game is. The game and its expansions seem to be always teetering on the edge of out of print. Expansions are nearly the price of a new game from a different publisher. Early versions of the game had misprints. Still to this point you cannot determine based on the publisher's info whether the 4th Edition, 2nd printing comes with the plastic domes or the wooden domes. Smaller publishers always seem to enjoy making the act of buying their game a puzzle to solve.

I would never play with more than 4 players. The rocket dice option is ridiculous and badly executed, do not invest in them regardless of how much you like the game.

I love the gameplay and I love the artwork. There's rich strategy and strong theme included. The game is a perfect amount of fun for 90-120 minutes of play. A comprehensive FAQ from the publisher with descriptions of all of the tech and agenda cards would be welcomed.

Maybe not the deepest game in the world, but Alien Frontiers gets major points for just being flat-out fun. The different orbital stations are creative and overall the game is very well balanced with many viable strategies to discover.

The artwork is good, there is an interesting assortment of actions to choose from.  Each player is competing to be the dominant faction colonizing an alien world.  It is a funky Euro game with a significant amount of "take that" in it.  Dice are rolled at the beginning of each player's turn and allocated to select actions.    There is a strong area majority control element and the current player with a majority in a particular region gets to benefit from a very useful bonus which is different from the other bonuses available in other regions.  These bonuses usually provide some kind of a resource discount when performing future actions.  There is a very fun deck of alien technology cards which can be obtained in order to bend the rules in manifold interesting ways.  Alien Frontiers is an excellent game and it's fun too.

On the surface, it looks like a dice game, but there's considerably more to it than that.  Alien Frontiers has strong engine-building elements and moderate area-control elements.

Also has nice art and good component quality.

It's okay.

It has a very strong "cool" factor. It's a cool theme with cool powers and and cool art.

However,

It really isn't my cup of tea for 2 players. As with most Area Majority it just turns into a zero sum nonsense.

And with more there's just no way to plan your turn ahead. And with two I was already annoyed with myself on how long it took to optimize your turn. You don't know what dice will be where. You don't know what your own roll will be. You don't know what cards will appear when you wipe the row.

The turn structure is just not very optimized from a logistics point of view.

It should be of no suprise that I really enjoy this game, as Kingsburg is one of my favorites and they are similar.   It does not have as may options for dice placement which can lead to some interesting decision making.  The alien tech cards and the raider's outpost do a great job of providing some outs/cheats/SYN moments.

Love the mechanics, love the interaction, love the artwork.  Great game.

Gran juego con ambientación de ciencia ficción clásica donde usamos dados para realizar acciones en distintas partes del tablero, cumpliendo una serie de condiciones en cada una de ellas (sumar x cantidad, ser dobles o triples, hacer una serie de dados, etc). El azar se controla mediante cartas de tecnología que nos permiten no depender tanto de sacar la tirada necesaria en cada momento. 

El objetivo es ganar a nuestros adversarios en una carrera por colonizar una luna dividida en diferentes territorios. Juego muy dinámico y divertido que da partidas muy disputadas y donde el pique y el puteo están muy presentes.

I like the theme and artwork, but I really love how well laid-out the game board is -- makes it easier to teach than other games with a similar level of complexity. The board sort of answers any rule question you might have. I don't like most worker placement games that much, but when your workers are dice it just feels so different, to me it feels like a separate mechanic altogether. The only cons are some downtime (you have to totally avoid AP players with this one) and the potential for the game to go a bit too long even with non-APers.

Decent dice game.  Really tight between 4 players...felt quite up in the air for a while.

Final turn came down to a king-maker situation for a player, who could either move against one player and let player 2 win, or do nothing and let player 1 win.

Lots of the cards allow serious screw-age with the leader, moving his colonies here, there, and everywhere, ensuring no leader can run away with it.  This might go too far as the cards don't get removed from the game....some of which probably should be one-use events.

Rating to come once published.

Great on paper, utterly boring in reality :(  
No emotions.  
Big downtime.
Dice utilization and manipulation - I hate it.  And the great(!) integration of this mechanics with the theme does not help at all.
Chaotic and messy - especially towards the end when every player is one step from winning and whoever comes victorious out of the exchange of mutual blows becomes a winner.  Zero control and fun.

Sold.

RATING: 4
Easy to see why there are mixed reviews. On the one hand, you have the coolness factor, nice graphics and some good ideas in the game, on the other problems....

So the positive is I like what the game is trying to do and some of the ideas in the game.  I like the cards and how they let you mitigate the dice, dice allocation worked well mostly and gave you some choices, area influence was a little simple but okay, graphics were good.  

For the issues, let's start with the big two, length and downtime, which are the worst offenders IMO. Probably a light middle-weight at most so 2 - 2.5 is just too long, by about 45 minutes, 90 minutes at most would have been a decent length for this. The downtime, bad bad bad as the dice increase AND you can't plan buggerall which is the worst kind of downtime, really each player doing one action would have been so much better than one player doing his/her turn while everyone waits, then the next player goes... 

Then there are the other things; Possible kingmaking, definite leader bashing, rolling doubles too important early on, games will likely always be very close so luck will be a factor in who wins. Then you have the "6" space for colonizing that can be effectively blocked for a few rounds near the end of the game by one player, this is a no-no. The stealing spot is too cheap and fruitful which means lots of screwage to go around so if you had any little plan at all, now you don't (maybe 4 dice would balance this a little more). Finally, decisions are somewhat made for you by the dice; depending on what you roll, this dictates what you can do and usually the best options are somewhat obvious like getting ships early and colonize asap as much as possible after.

Bottom line for me is for this kind of game I definitely prefer Kingsburg (with exp) for now.
 
Possible houserules - Yes the game works as is but many think it could be improved. The obvious thing is to have people do one action only, then the next player, etc. Unfortunatly this might require a few more changes to work properly, not quite sure though. The length could be tweaked too probably though then you would really have an empty planet, again another change or two just to make this work...combined with the other issues not sure all the effort would be worth it.

I am beginning to wonder if the "popular" games are for me - I seem to like so few of them. 

I think this is a well produced and thought out game, but plays too slowly to be fun in any form.

And I so dislike any game where instead of being rewarded for great moves/plans/ideas/play you can simply get a lucky die roll and steal resources/card from another player. That is the sort of nonsense I expect from a Hasbro "family" game, not a game that gamers play!

Good fun quick game.  Worker placement with dice (serving as ships).  While dice games are subject to luck, there are sufficient options and dice modification options through the alien artifact cards that wins feel earned.  The components are very high quality and the art is sort of a 50's retro look that contributes nicely to the feel.  For a self-published game, very impressive!

RATING: 4
Alien Frontiers takes the dice rolling mechanics of Castles of Burgundy and pushes them even further, requiring more Yahtzee-like combinations of dice to perform certain actions and introducing some worker placement-like blocking. The game has a number of interesting decisions to make and provides several paths to victory. It's enjoyable to puzzle out the best way to allocate dice.

However, the game has two serious flaws that ruin it for me. The first is the inclusion of aggressive attacking (beyond the indirect attacking in the area control portion of the game). It feels out of place in a strategic game like this and can turn the game into one where players have to pretend they are doing well to avoid attacks. The bigger issue is the core mechanic of rolling dice. Bad dice rolls can cost players games. There is always something one can do in this game, but certain dice rolls can provide significantly better options. There's also no way to manipulate dice rolls without investing in special abilities. On top of all this, the inability to roll dice before a player's turn slows the game down (due to no pre-turn planning).

The bad outweighs the good for me, so Alien Frontier is a game I tend to avoid.

Let's see... Lots of downtime, check.  Lots of analysis paralysis potential, check.  Kingmaking potential, check.  Not for me, check.  Update: a couple years after my first play, I decided to give it another shot.  It was worse the second time.  The game was very attack-y, which makes it more political than my "Kingmaking" comment might suggest.  And the guy who had 7 dice was extremely AP, which meant the game lasted forever.  Can you blame the game for somebody being AP?  You can when there are a myriad of options every turn.

I truly enjoy the die rolling and placement of die.  I like the choices.  I like that it has some direct interaction through the "Raider's Outpost" and some of the field markers.

Very good game.

I think it's sweet spot is 3 players. 

I would like to get the Factions expansion if it ever comes out again.  However, I would not play this with 5 players, because the game would be terribly long with lots of down time between turns.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (December 2011)

To be perfectly honest, I don’t remember much about this game. I remember I didn’t like it, but I don’t remember the reasons (I do remember I was very disappointed). My first play was so bad, that I have shied away from the game even though there have been many opportunities to play it. On 2011 I was a lot easier on my rankings, so now I’m doing an effort to keep my ratings according to the BGG rating recommendation system. I’m downgrading its rating to a 5.0 (a game I don’t want to play again) and I will play again soon to review my feeling about the game.

Current Rating: 5.0

Played a five player game of this with Factions and the game ran >3.5 hours.  Way to long for a game of this type.  Suffers from long downtime and a fair potential for king making. I don't think I'd play this game with 5 players again.  I'd maybe play with three but with so many great games out there I'd just assume pick another one.

Its an okay game, many of my gaming friends do not enjoy space themed games.  And the ones who do, mechanically there are better games to play with them.  Mechanically this is a game I want to play with my non-gamer friends.  But what I have found is that those folks typically don't enjoy the space theme.

RATING: 9
- One of my personal favourites.
- I love the puzzle of how to best utilise the cards, territory bonuses and player abilities to execute your strategy.
- The way the action spaces use different combinations of dice, combined with the card abilities means that most dice rolls present good options. Whether the dice enable what you originally wanted to do is the question, but there are plenty of ways to manipulate the dice with the cards if you're a player that prefers more control.
- I also like the way players' dice remain on spaces until the start of their next turn. This adds an additional layer of strategy and contributes to the player interaction as you're always blocking/being blocked.
- The game looks great on the table, plays okay with all player counts, however I think 3 is the best, followed closely by 4.
- I recommend the factions expansion though I don't own any of the others. I like the goals and the player powers in factions, but I feel the other exp. will just add additional unnecessary mechanics that won't be worth the extra rules explanation.
- Teaching this is okay, but there is a fair amount to take in for players looking for the next step after Catan (for example).

MUCH better with three than with two. I can't wait to play again. There's plenty of opportunities for very clever play, politics, engine building of a sorts, aggression, area control, etc.

We used extra dice to roll behind screens from T&E to avoid downtime. Ideally I would use another set of similarly colored dice for each person. At the end of their turn, they would roll the dice behind the screen, plan their turn, then reveal and place the new dice on their turn. Using white dice to roll was a just a little clunky because you would then need to sort the values on the colored dice to place on the board.

I picked this game up almost by chance... I bought some games from someone and although this game was on my radar it wasn't near the top. As it turns out I got myself a keeper!! My brother loved this game so much he ran out and bought a copy for himself. I found this game a little harder to learn than I would have liked but it was the end of the day and I think I had learned three games already, so I will give it the benefit of the doubt. It was a hard game to explain to my wife because you are lost have to explain everything to even begin playing. My copy is an older one but my brothers copy came with some cool components. After playing this game three or four times the game really begins to shine.... the tactics are plentiful and with the many avenues for victory gives this game some great replay ability. The game starts slower than it finishes and there is a lot of back and forth.
This is my brothers favorite game only falling to dead of winter.

Alien Frontiers is very strategic for a dice game. Since various numbers & combinations give you different options, there aren't very many bad rolls--so luck is minimized surprisingly well. I love the theme, which comes across very strongly (territories named after sci-fi writers is a brilliant twist!). Cards allow for diversity of strategy, interaction, and repeat playability.

RATING: 8
A boardgame where you roll your dice and place them in places where they fullfill the combinations required for specific actions. The 6'er field is very broken late game. Made house rules to balance it more. One of the alien artifact cards is also broken. Made house rules for that also. But its a fun little game with a nice pace.

Not a bad game, but it has a bit too much down time for my taste. Also, the game lends itself to players taking very long turns as they try to figure out what the best options are. I also am not a fan of the way the worker placement is handled.

RATING: 8
A game in which the pieces are the 2-7 dice you roll, and the dice you roll determine what those pieces can do: increase the number of dice, sacrifice a 6 to build a settlement, triples build a settlement, get resources, steal resources, etc. There are plenty of different strategies and the pieces are well made. A fairly original game mechanic that keeps it open and encourages repeated plays.

BIG PLUS: easy to learn, great graphics, dice rolling
BIG MINUS: limited slots may mean the right roll comes too late

QUIBBLE MINUS: there are multiple editions, with each one getting more intricate pieces… and so conversion kits are available, when they shouldn't be
EVEN BIGGER MISS: this is one game that most retailers are not allowed to ship… so buying it online is a pain

Based on one play with four players. I didn't feel that there was a whole lot of planning that goes into a turn since you need to roll your dice and see what they provide you.

I'll probably play again at some point but I don't have a desire to go out of my way to sit at the game.

Played again with 5 players and the factions expansion. There are too many things that bother me with this game both in its basic form and in the expansion that will actively keep me from playing it again.

RATING: 6
The game is really quite simple. There are a number of action fields on the board that require poker-like dice combos to activate (pair, three-of-a-kind, straight) and other fields that take dice of any value or give things depending on the value. There is always something to do with your dice, but you can't always do what you want. Dice placed by other players can block you from certain actions and you can't be sure if your desired actions will be blocked or if you'll have the values to use them until you actually roll your dice. The object is to place colonies on the central board in an area majority game that generates points and special abilities. You can also acquire cards to enable you to manipulate your rolls and move dice and colonies among other actions.

I do enjoy some of the more creative dice-manipulation games, but for my tastes, this one is too much dependent on your rolls and there is little to think about between turns because so much can change. The game can be almost unbearable with a slow player at the table. This is a fairly light, quick game and needs to be played as such to be enjoyable. King-making and bash-the-leader are also symptoms of the game and are additional reasons to take the game lightly.

Update 6/2015:  Still not able to get this out.  rating somewhat impacted due to barrier to entry.

Dice are rolled and used to do various actions such as selecting resources, getting cards that give you special powers, gaining additional dice, and building colonies. A colony counts for one victory point and having dominance counts for one. Getting in the lead early makes you a target. The cards add some interesting abilities including ways to affect the dice. The dice only seem to add a small amount of randomness because there always seems to be something good to do with them.

I purchased Alien Frontiers because of the buzz and positive reviews from almost everyone that posted on BGG after AF's release. Worker placement games are one of my favorite genres and I probably played the majority of the well known games, including Agricola, Le Havre, Caylus, Stone Age, Age of Empires III. But I haven't played Kingsburg, so I was very curious to see how a mechanism that involved dice rolling was implemented in such a category of games. I was pleasantly suprised. My expectations were extremely high for this game, and it didn't live up to them. But my first and only game so far was really good, and the randomness that comes with dice didn't stand in the way of controling my gameplay. I'm very curious to see how this game will develop in my opinion. UPDATE: after 3 plays I can say that it didn't develop very well, I like it less than I hoped I would. The main reason: you can only start thinking after you've rolled the dice, and that slows the game down immensely.

I really wanted to love this, and on paper it seems like I should. I can't quite put my finger on it, but something just doesn't click for me with this game.

Fast forward a year and a half, and I had the chance to play AF again with an entirely different group. A different experience for sure, and I can say that I certainly enjoyed it a whole lot more. However, there's still something about the game that doesn't feel right to me. But having said that, having picked it up again later, I'm more intrigued to play it again and determine what the element is that isn't hitting home.

Lots of down time, leaderbashing and combo building - Alien Frontier combines most things I don't like in boardgaming into one package. It still gets a 5 because there are some temporarily satisfying moves to be made and for some reason I kept on thinking about it after our game. If only the satisfying moves were of any use. When you develop a real good strategy be ready to be creamed real good by your fellow players. The best strategy is the boring generic multiplayer conflict strategy to stay close behind the leader and prepare for the final dash to victory. This nullyfies most thinking that went into the game. Euro strategy and Ameritrash just don't gel well. Although I am in the minority with this opinion as it seems. Other than that, Alien Frontiers is setting new production and art standards for small publishers.

I was disappointed by this game.  I can see why people would like it, as for many people the SF theme is appealing.  I don't care for the theme, but my problem with the game lies in the actual gameplay rather than the theme.  

There have been a lot of "use dice as action" games and I don't think that this makes any improvement on any of those.  I dislike Kingsburg, enjoy Yspahan, and I think Livingstone and Troyes are not bad.

Even though there are ways to mitigate the luck of the dice, luck seems to play a big part.  But I don't have that big of a problem with luck either.  The main problem is that I found the game to lack excitement.  The decisions were not interesting and there was little tension at all.  It also seemed to last a little too long, shaving a half hour off the play time would have made a big difference.

This game has been compared to Kingsburg but I think it operates on a completely different level. There is actually player interaction and choices that edge people out besides just the initial dice placement. You have colony placement and the raider which literally steals from others as well as the techs which can be downright evil. This game is mean and is a strategy game oddly enough. Even I like this game, and I hate dice.

Complaints:
The art is horrendous and sometimes people can be eliminated from this game.

This is one of my favorite games.  Love the artwork, love the "dice as ships" thing and "docking" them to get resources or take actions.  I think the best way to play this may be with the Factions expansion where you now have secret goals to try and complete.  The components are so nice, from the little spaceships, to the thick cardboard stock (especially with Factions, those Faction tiles are premium).  I think 3 could be the sweet spot maybe?

I like this game a lot - especially with the Outer Belt Expansion which gives a bit more variety and reduces the first player advantage.
It is the first game which introduced the dice=worker mechanic to me which was a welcomed change to the usual worker placement mechanics. The game is very tightly designed and the base game alone provides a lot of challenges (although at 4 Players the last slot is at a disadvantage).

Overall I love this game a lot and it is deep enough to provide you with strategic options although you are dependent on your dice rolls. I found there was rarely nothing I could do and with the outer belt expansion the problem of being too late to a specific action field is mostly mitigated by the chances the belt offers.

I should play this more often :)

I enjoy figuring out how best to use the dice and using cards to do combos. But it is heavily dependent on the dice. Sometimes you just don't have much of interest to do. I think at least 3/4 of my plays have been won by the person who got their 4th die first.

Not the best game for me. The dice create a big luck factor for such a big game and the kingmaking aspect is way too strong. Due to the highly tactical nature of the game you can't plan at all between your turns and the downtime becomes huge as optimizing the use of dice on one's turn can lead to severe analysis paralysis. The production values of the game are great and I generally like the dice based worker placement mechanism combined with light area control.

The sci-fi theme comes through on all aspects of this game.  It has a nice balance of strategic options, and uses the dice-as-ships mechanic nicely.

Not a bad dice placement/worker placement game. Theme isn't bad either. Only reason I got rid of it was due to better games get played over this one when we sat down with friends - for over a year. I would consider trading for it back again at some point, but I wouldn't buy it again.

Traded away 4/13/11 for Marvel Heroes.


I think it's OK.  Worth the purchase for sure (although NOT worth the insane prices I have seen!!!  I got mine for $30+ US at release...)

However, it has some problems, imho. The Raider's spot is ridiculous.  I am considering house-ruling it to 2 or 3 resources...I dunno...

Also, the game length is a tad too much for what you get out of it.  The game ends with little climax...

Kingsburg, it ain't, imo.  Again, it's decent...just not great.

Strongly reminiscent of Kingsburg, this game offers more choices for your shittier die rolls and a bit less flexibility in strategy. I'd buy this before I bought K., but I'm not sure it really has a whole lot of lasting power. It could become a lot more interesting with expansions. Still, not bad.

This is, hands down, my favorite game. It's just the right amount of tactics and strategy, since it mixes a euro-style game with the luck of the dice. But, you have plenty of opportunities to mitigate the luck, leaving you with this feeling that anything's possible.

Fantastic game.

After one play, I have to say I like this little game. I like the dice-as-playing-pieces aspect, and the domed cities are adorable. But for a lighter game, it takes a long time. The problem is that nobody can plan moves ahead: the dice are inaccessible until the next turn. A game like [thing=102680][/thing], which is by all standards a weightier game, has faster-moving turns because players can get their mancala pieces into position ahead of time and plan what they will do for this Builder action and what will happen upon activation of that Trajan tile. This gives players something to do when it is not their turns and helps keep the game moving swiftly. Not so in Alien Frontiers. The game would most likely benefit from players being given two sets of dice so that they could roll and plan ahead during downtime. Also some extra player interaction would be nice--for instance, what if instead of blocking everybody out of the get-a-new-die spot until a player's next turn, that player could be bumped off the board and PAID for his trouble in resources, cards, etc.? Blocking other people out of a spot is just not direct enough player interaction for my tastes, and I think it needlessly extends the game. Still, I enjoyed my first play and want to play again.

Great dice worker-placement game with a classic sci-fi theme.

This was a game where I wish I had when I didn't, and wanted to play it so bad.  When I got it, the first few plays were really good, but AP is a real dead lock in this game.  I have a pretty AP prone friend and due to the mechanics of this game's pace, it really grind on us.  The game lasted over 5+ hours and it really shouldn't have.  Which lead to subsequent games to be timed turns to cut down on the AP.  Even at 2 mins a turn it dragged on for quite a bit with 3 players.

Theme is amazing, artwork is amazing, overall wonderful game and I don't think I'm getting rid of it ever.  I'd just recommend that you play with people who are less prone to AP and in the first couple of plays, lower the win conditions so you can start a timed game there after.

This is the first Euro I have ever taught my mom to play.  I was always leery about teaching my mom my games, because a lot of them are big and scary rulefests full of exceptions and crazy scoring mechanisms, and to be fair, I was kind of a snob about it.  

I was worried she wouldn't find them fun, or they would be complicated.  AF was perfect because it reminded her a lot of Yahtzee, which we have played countless times as I grew up.

Well, she whupped me good in 2 of the 3 games we played, and it came down to the tie breaker in the only game I won tonight.  I think I have been shown my place, time to show my mom all the great games that are out there.

One of the few medium-weight games that I think I'd enjoy over many plays. There's a little bit of area majority, a lot of dice, and some special abilities, but it's not yahtzee. It's worth a try.

(The dice are supposed to be ships, I guess. They just don't feel like spaceships. They feel like dice.)

Only played once. I don't know of another worker placement game that avoids the "cleanup" phase where everyone returns their workers and the board starts fresh. I love how there's a continuous flow and you have multiple ways to acquire resources and establish colonies. The R/P/I tokens seemed superfluous to me, but would need to play again. I wanted to play this again immediately after the first play.

130216 Finally played it. Sort of disappointed, as it has a wonderful, wonderful theme and graphics, but the gameplay seems lacking to a point of bordering on pure luck. Also, there's a screwage factor due to blocking facility slots and, of course, the mighty raiders. Still hope I'm wrong, though.

Good ideas, but unfortunately the game takes a way, way too long time. There are problems with the core scoring (the area majority system isn't very interesting here), you can be blocked out of some major spots without having any chance to recover, and the stealing mechanism doesn't feel like a good way to balance the game. Dice rolling is always fun, though, and the production values (except for the plastic hemispheres) are top notch. Karim Chakroun did a great job with the graphic design.

A fun and innovative game where the dice rolls determine what actions you can choose but there are various options, cards, and special powers that give you a lot of options for how to use any given roll.

I really enjoyed playing this game one time but I could see my rating for it going way up or way down with more plays. It has going for it a fun and fresh mechanic and lots of interesting choices. However, the plethora of choices could start to make the game drag and I'm not sure I love how the end game works.

Sounds good in theory, but in practice the multiplayer chaos and kick the leader make any strategy completely subordinate to being political.

Alien Frontiers would improve a lot if it was a bit shorter and less chaotic. It also has the always clunky "lazy designer's solution for solving runaway leader problems"-mechanism (action to steal stuff from one player) + it's a bit odd and pointless to play area majority game with six pieces (or less actually, placing the sixth ends the game). 

On the plus side using dice as workers is a fun idea, altough not a unique one and some rolls are still clearly better than others. Production values are excellent and overall graphical design of the game looks good without being distracting.

First play: Nice, quick, fun little game

More plays: pretty rubbish really

Downtime is the killer. Nothing to do but watch other players go through all their combos. Even with 3 it's bad - wouldn't consider it with more.

The cards (rubbish balance and options they throw in) & the endgame (bash the leader) make it particularly bad

Alien frontiers is a gateway / family game to me in the sense that rules are easy to explain and scoring is close.
the game is easy to play as well
and it is just short enough to place itself i those categories.

Thae art is nice. the board is functional and the dice worker mechanism works pretty good. Before alien frontiers Kingsburg did it. Troyes improved on that. And Alien frontiers well it feels different. and is a pretty unique game.
I've played over 500 different games now and while alien frontiers has it plusses like for instance Takenoko it misses an element for me to play with friends that have played over 200 different games. they too see the strong points as a family game but it lacks depth. We have no wish to explore it further.

Having said that Alien frontiers has for now a steady place in my collection and I will propose it  with non gamers and families. My personal rating would be a 6. I would place it next to stone age and Takenoko. that's why I rate it a 7. those games are still fun to play for me and excellent with the right group.

edit rerating 2017

Rating unchanged

I wouldn't put it next to stone age and takenoko anymore.
takenoko is the much easier game.
Stone age is easier to grasp.
Alien Frontiers might just be one of those games that fall inbetween casual and gamers games.

One of the Best Dice-Placing games ever,a little more strategy than Kingsburg ,I like also a lot the Area Control part of the game influencing dice placement.In the end the game is a run ,the downside is that is diffcult for players who fall behind to reach for the first ones....So if you make a wrong move or you have some really bad dice rolling turn right at the beginning you'd better think about next game....Don't go never behind 5 dices otherwise you'll risk to have the same problem of the beginning ,during the game slowing your develope of the strategy....

9: For 2 players
7: For more than 2 players

Was One of my favorites. Really clever way to use dice as worker placement. I also enjoy any game that can be so appreciated on a tactical level - a particular turn can be very impressive, so much so that watching other players make interesting moves is part of the fun of the game.  Some negatives: The AP on this can get bad, and it usually takes longer than 90min to play. The game can also suffer a bit from bashing the leader, but you can mitigate it by purposely avoiding being the leader while trying not to fall behind. It's also mitigated by the Faction expansion agenda cards. While I like the art work and theme, it isn't really tied to the mechanics in any meaningful way.

1/16/14: I've now decided that this game, with 4+ people, maybe 3 as well, is an exercise in chaos at the end game.  It can still be fun, but with all the interesting tactical elements in the beginning of the game, it's a strange mix and not the thing that attracted me to the game. So I like it more with the 2.

The game swings a bit too much for my tastes, particularly with the raiders.  The take-that abilities are very targeted and not necessarily well-balanced in their effect on the overall game.  The area majority aspect of the game is also weakened by the strong incentive to spread out even though placements are severely limited; competition greatly weakens all the players involved.

Despite the greatly varying value of different dice combinations, the dice manipulation abilities are much more limited than in similar games, like To Court the King.  They also don't evoke their associated thematic elements that well.

This is a great worker placement with dice (which are considered ships).  So many options to put your dice and lots of Alien Technology to allow you to change the value of the pips.

Alien Frontiers is a game of resource management and planetary development for two to four players. During the game you will utilize orbital facilities and alien technology to build colony domes in strategic locations to control the newly discovered world.

The game board shows the planet, its moon, the stations in orbit around the planet, and the solar system’s star. The dice you are given at the start of the game represent the space ships in your fleet. You will assign these ships to the orbital facilities in order to earn resources, expand your fleet, and colonize the planet.

RATING: 6.6
Pro:
* It's a pretty neat mechanism, Alea Iacta Est-style, and I really like Alea Iacta Est.
* It's got some logical puzzle-solving aspect that I love (how should I distribute& combine the 3-6 dice rolled?)
Con:
* It's a bit longer than it should be
* It has two different (colored and shaped) resources and it's a resource convertion Euro - without any sense of theme. Well, I'm a Knizia fan so that shouldn't be a problem. I like sci-fi as well but even in other sci-fi games with weak connection between mechanism and theme - Charon, Inc., Star Trek: Expeditions, and hard to say, but Race for the Galaxy - I felt the theme more than here. It's just an illustration here and nothing more. I could never feel there's something happening.
In the end I could feel the fun of Alea Iacta Est is missing a bit here (I even liked the theme more there); it's just not as light-hearted while the mechanism would require a more lighthearted approach.

Pretty good dice placing game with a neat theme and lots of Sci-Fi references. The artwork is alright but with only two players it felt rather mediocre (i.e. too many options, too little interaction for my taste). I guess it would be better to play it at full player count.

This is really what you'd get if you crossbred "Mission: Red Planet" and Kingsburg.  Not a bad game, but very volatile and hard to steer.  Unless you suck, what do you for most of the game is of little consequence and everything will get be decided over the last 2 rounds because bash the leader will kick in if someone gets ahead any sooner.  Raiding/stealing is very powerful and make it hard to really plan, and cards can have devastating effect that completely turn games around.  I'd rather play Troyes and even Kingsburg when I'm in the mood for a game with this type of mechanics.

LIKES:

* Dice stay on the board blocking other players from choosing the action.  Of course, this also effects you!
* Different viable actions available depending on what you roll (IE - 3 die straight, a pair, higher number, etc.).  Also, one spot you can always place dice if you have nowhere else to go.
* Alien tech cards do add some nice flavor/special abilities to the game.  Do NOT let someone dominate these or set up a nice combination.

DISLIKES:
* One really cannot plan ahead due to uncertainty of what will be available on the board and what one will roll.  This can lead to quite a bit of dead time as more deliberate players wrestle out their best possible move.
* This game needs to move quickly to keep my attention due to lack of many options.  If it moves slowly, this game drags for me since you really cannot plan ahead.  

If everyone plays quickly, I rate the game a 6.  If even one person plays more slowly and deliberately, I DON'T want to play and would rate it a 2.

Well designed dice game that integrates elements of To Court the King and Kingsburg in a satisfying resource acquisition and building game.  I may prefer the two player game to the full compliment of players as the colony placements of others can lead to odd kingmaking situations.  Luck plays a role but alien technology cards can mitigate that somewhat.  There is a choice of options each turn even with poor rolls and I enjoy the tradeoffs that those choices force you to make.

Downgrading my score on this one very slightly... just because it has lost a bit of appeal quicker than expect with many plays. Still one of the best games I've played.

Alien Frontiers has a nice balance of easy & fun, family oriented game play, combined with just enough tactical and strategic depth and variation to keep things interesting. Its easy to learn, with tons of replay value.

Quite simply my new favorite game.

Due the low amount of produced games of the first print I had to painfully wait a long time to get this beauty. The theme is crucial for this game, it compensates some flaws it has. The original use of dice deserves big credit.
Some flaws I think the game has : end phase of the game is too predictable, the components besides the dice and the board aren't that great, especially the cheap score track, but the artstyle makes up for the total picture.

This game isn't that interesting with 2 players, but great with 3 and 4.

I should love this game. Worker placement. Sci-Fi theme. Dice. Yet, I am not a fan. 

Basically it comes down to this. I look at my dice then I look at my choices. Then I realize I don't want to do any of them. Choices are either obvious or just not interesting.

Played a couple of games now. Two player is surprisingly good. Got the version with the extra cards and rockets so that's great. It was an impulse buy but no regrets. Some of the finest components in a game I've seen since Stone Age. If you can get it for a good price, go for it.

[Update] In the long run two players is not really worth it. If I get a bunch of players I'm willing, just feel there is better games. Dropped to a 7

RATING: 8
Alien Frontiers is a new indie dice game about colonizing planets. It combines a handful of standard euro ideas – resource management, worker placement, area control, even using dice as “workers” seems to be the new new thing – into a more or less fresh package. While it is not without issues, it works pretty well.

Since I went to the trouble of coming up with a set of criteria for judging dice games, I may as well apply them here:

1) Downtime is the Enemy: This is the biggest problem with Alien Frontiers. While you only roll your dice once on your turn, there are enough options (plus a small special powers element which broadens the decision tree) that analysis paralysis is a real possibility, especially among players that are unfamiliar with the game. My first game (with four) took almost an hour and a half (with me and another player perhaps being a little too chatty for the flow of play). I’m sure this would come down to an hour or even 45 minutes with experienced players, but that’s a big hurdle to jump over. There’s a little bit to consider while other players are going, and a bit of mild take-that to add player interaction, but downtime is, by and large, downtime.

2) No More Than One Roll per Turn: The biggest win of the design. You roll once each turn and only reroll, maybe, one die thanks to a special power card. Almost enough by itself to make me recommend AF :)

3) Give Players a Chance to React to the Dice: Also a big win, although also the root cause of the AP problems. There are some special powers that offer simple dice manipulations, but the important part of the game here is that you assign dice to different actions, with each action requiring a certain pattern (like a straight or a pair). There is one option that works best with low dice, plus a dump option for miscellaneous dice, as well. As a result, you usually have a couple of plausible options to consider after you roll. This does not mean that there isn’t still a luck of the dice factor, but it’s not out of line.

4) Low Rolls Should Not Suck, High Rolls Should Not Rule: A mixed bag here. Some of the actions have multiple slots available for workers/dice to occupy, but if a player already has dice present, you can only place if your set is higher than theirs. This mechanic adds some indirect interaction and tension, but it also ups the luck factor by making high rolls generally better than low. There is at least one action that works better with low dice, but it’s also the least used, alas.

Overall, I like and recommend Alien Frontiers. It’s just fresh enough to be fun, and it does feel like you have enough control over what you’re doing. I do wonder if it would hold up to heavy play, though. It’s not quick enough to be filler, and I don’t yet see much variation in the narrative from game to game. Learning curve will keep things fresh for a handful of plays, but let’s see if it lives past that.

I'm normally not that much of a fan of dice placement games, but this one has a lot of ways to manipulate your dice. This manipulation doesn't make me like the game more because of mitigating luck per se, but instead my normal problem with dice placement is rolling before vs. after removes the tension of the risk-reward of your action. The manipulation doesn't fix that, but adds a lot of tactics on how you can manipulate your dice. I wish however there was more long term planning; since there are so many spots that basically do the same thing in different ways and the spots available to me can be completely different from turn to turn, it feels very much like I'm just playing for the here and now. That, the lack of buildings, and no Intrigue cards are probably why I still like Lords of Waterdeep more, despite the cards/tokens that give you powers and the tactics of the dice manipulation. It is kind of cool there is an area control aspect for the abilities, but that along with the fact you can get extra dice in this game means there is runaway leader, or there would be if there wasn't a very blatant direct attack. I wish the attack was more subtle in its approach. Like Lords of Waterdeep theme is mostly pasted on.

Somehow, the areas of the planet named after SF authors is a turn-off.  I don't know why I'm down on this game.  Something I ate, perhaps.

A very impressive game where dice are used as workers to take actions.  You do have many ways for mitigating the luck in the game.  It is a very elegant game and is relatively family friendly.

I have recently found that I enjoy dice games where I have a lot of choices on what to do with the roll.  Alien Frontier seems to be take that concept and bump it up an notch.

Yes, it is random, but it is what you do with the random that is important.  With a lot of ability to modify the rolls to make it work.

Add to that several different strategies to complete goals and you have a winning game!

The decisions on how to use dice are quite hard but you cannot prep because you can't pre-roll since your dice are used to block others. The block idea is neat but in practice this just slows the game down. Would be better to be able to retrieve and pre roll dice but some spaces have special requirements

RATING: 3.7
This is going to be my least favorite of the "throw dice to get stuff" style of games. This game may be a little more brutal than it needs to be. You definitely do not want to find yourself in the lead until the last turn as you will become the target of the moment. You also need the artifact that keeps people from stealing your resources or you will find you have nothing come your turn. With 4 players the wait for your turn is a bit long this is probably a result of the fact that planning your turn in advance is pretty much useless.

Best played with full complement of 4. Possible to find yourself on the wrong end of a beating through no fault of your own if the dice fall badly, but quick enough to justify luck elements and it's a fairly light and enjoyable game in most respects. There is a reasonable amount of interaction through raiding and tech card effects, which helps to bring it to life. It is a little sparse in terms of strategic decisions though, since the way the dice fall imposes luck-based constraints on your play, so it is important to not go into it expecting something it's not. It also means that for the game to be enjoyable you need next to zero downtime and I would recommend playing with a pretty strict timer or a conscious effort by all players to allocate dice as soon as humanly possible.

The pulp Sci-Fi theme sets this game apart from many other games with similar mechanics, and I really get a kick out of it. The components are of a good quality, although the Chinese-printed board is a bit prone to warping.

This is worker placement with dice, a similar idea to Kingsburg, but with much better execution. There's a good amount of player interaction, both direct (stealing cards, competing for territory) and indirect (blocking spaces).

Gameplay is a little bit slow as a 4 player game, with significant downtime (it's not really possible to plan ahead), but as a 2 player game it's quite satisfying.

Excuse me, but, how did this one get into the top 100 on BGG?

This is a worker placement game that is driven by dice rolls. On top of that, there are some overpowered cards. Ok, you can steal them away, but I really don't like games where you need to aggressively steal away another players results of hard work. And then, the theme is, sci-fi. I don't like sci-fi games, and in fact, the material looks sci-fi (except the dice, euh ships), but it really feels like a dice rolling game. And the game has this "leader runaway" problem, where, once you are winning, there is no way to catch you up since you have so much more advantages, that it's almost impossible. 

Definitely not a game for me. 

Minus: 1 (not with 2) - 3 (dice.. pff) - 5 - 7 - 8 (runaway leader) - 9 - [-1]

I love Alien Frontiers. No matter how your luck turns out with the dice rolls you still have many choices. There are moments when you may feel like you are out of the game but it is easy to pull off an awesome combo and get right back in it.  The theme is perfect. There is nothing like placing the Holographic Decoy down on the table. 

My recommendation: Buy the upgrade pack! Having the colony minis makes for such a great visual. Worth every penny.

[b]Great game - I like dice placement and sci-fi themes, and this pushes both buttons. 
Can be very slow with AP-prone players. I've added another set of dice, which players can pre-roll behind a screen to do at least some thinking before it is their turn. Of course there'll be changes in what options are available, but I've found it still speeds up the game a little.[/b]

Un worker placement con dados muy parecido a Kingsburg. Definitivamente es más complejo, pues dependiendo del orden en que hagas las acciones sacarás o no mayor provecho de tu turno. El arte es genial y los colores de los dados aún más. Las acciones son sencillas y se explica en poco tiempo.

On the fence about trading this away.  Fun for two or three.  I'm not sure I would play with four again.  The game encourages AP because players cannot plan ahead.  Downtime is a problem.

Fine worker placement game using dice. It has everything that I like about a typical euro: worker placement, area control, replayability, some player interactions. One thing I cannot stand is how slow the gameplay is. Can't really plan ahead as you only roll the dice on your turn and then weigh on the myriad options. I would enjoy the game a lot more if can be finished in an hour and a half ballpark.

The strategy is very linear. Collect fuel and ore. Build colonies. Tech cards can mitigate some luck. However tech cards can be unreasonably powerful such as blowing up someone ship. The dice placement options are limited. You roll and take the best possible action. You spend two turns collecting resources and then have them taken away by one sequence roll sucks the fun right out. Really wanted to like this game. Too much player screwage for me to enjoy. This is essentially a race game that was not fun to play.

Great game. It falls somewhere between Stone Age and Troyes in terms of depth. It's hard to find dice games that have meaningful choices. There's so many ultra-light dice games like Skyline, Can't Stop, and Las Vegas that absolutely fall flat for me. Alien Frontiers is special. Like Stone Age, it scales very well, is relatively easy to learn, and offers tremendous replayability.

4 / 5 - Very Good

All the ingredients are right for a good Euro-style game and this is certainly the best of the Euro-dice crowd. In addition to cunningly solving the manner in which random and strategy can pull in different directions by simply ensuring that your rolls always leave you in a position to do something useful, it also has a surprisingly and delightfully mean streak of player interaction. But I have a nasty suspicion that it engineers close finishes that are too close - detracting from the early parts of the game which feel kind of pointless, and resulting in far too many drawn games.

Dice often add too much luck into a game, but in Alien Frontiers there are no bad rolls, just different ones.  High numbers and low numbers have different uses, but both are useful.  You have to adapt, but very rarely get stuck needing to roll a particular number.  The game is really really fun.

This is a solid game and I like the dice as workers mechanic. The dice can have some luck, but that is mitigated by having spots on the board requiring anything (vs 6s always being best), and cards help change. 

The game is tight and quick, though the theme is a bit lacking in base version. Believe expansions add more flavor and fun. 

Can have a kingmaking problem. Nice area control race

settle Mars by rolling dice and assigning them to various functions on the board.  Your dice occupy their spaces until your next turn, limiting the options for subsequent players.

10/30/10 Played a four-player game. Alien Frontiers has nice graphics/art work and usually very clear text on the cards. It can be a bit of a brain burner near the end when you're trying desperately to figure out the optimal dice placement, and there are eight places to put them. When this happens down time becomes an issue due to analysis paralysis. One minor issue: the clear die used for the central sector is hard to read. They should have used a standard white die. Overall I enjoyed the game and look forward to playing it again.

Alien Frontier is a relatively quick game where luck can be greatly diminish with careful judgements and choices.

An interesting and entertaining dice game which is a combination of worker placement, take-that actions, area control and resource management. Simple mechanisms and well thought out costings for actions make this a very good game at its shorter length - the long game, however, outstays its welcome. I give the short game an 8, but the long would be at least a couple of points lower.

This is a decent and entertaining dice game with the caveat that it's not Troyes. By which I mean that Troyes is, so far, the best and most innovative dice game I've played. Alien Frontiers is a very good game, but it's not Troyes.

Simulates the colonization of Mars with a fun mechanic that uses dice as ships which get to dock at different orbital facilities depending on how you roll.  There is ALWAYS something productive you can do with them, no matter what you roll.  The trick is to get the most out of them.  There's enough tactics and strategy here to make a decent game.

I wanted to like this game a lot more than I actually did. I usually enjoy games that make strategic use of dice, but this one basically fell flat for me. I haven't felt enough tension in the games I've played, and there never seems to be any tough decisions to be made. Our games have also suffered from a run-away-leader problem, which I fear will develop into a bash-the-leader/kingmaking problem in later plays. Just not enough for me to be excited about.

A worker placement in space. The Players have to colonize a new planet. Dice represent ships and depending on what you roll you can use orbital stations which provide you with different benefits: give you ore or fuel (the two currencies), allow you to build more ships, colonize the planet and more. The colonized areas of the planet increase benefits from orbital facilities and (most importantly) give VPs.

It is a very good game and it is easy to pick up by new players. There are usually enough choices that you can't be screwed by bad rolls.

I recommend playing with Factions after getting a hang of the basic game. They add additional facilities and also give players special abilities as well as hidden objectives.

I would recommend playing wit 2 or 3 players. A four players game can drag a bit and be a bit random, because it doesn't allow for a lot of planning as the board will be completely different when your turn comes.

I would lie to try it out with one of the solo variants.

I think this game is interesting but has some flaws.  It's a real hybrid between being a euro and a take-that luck infused Amerithrash.  In the end, it's too deterministic AFTER the dice are rolled, which is too lucky because there isn't enough roll mitigation built in.  The amount of take-that also feels out of whack.

The game is also setup to fundamentally encourage King-making.  This is probably group dependent, but it's a real potential pitfall built into the design.  There are also serious issues with AP.  I've seen non-AP players bog down.

I really have struggled to enjoy this game in comparison to the love showered on it.  What really kills it is the existence of many other, better, "dice worker placement" games.

Some good mechanisms, like leaving the dice on the board for blocking.  Always something you can do with your dice.  Quite a few options of attack.  You can be aggressive, but players always seem to have a chance to come back.  A lot of chance.  I think Troyes is a better dice game, but this was pretty fun as well.

However, I do tend to agree with many of the comments posted by people rating the game a 5 or less.  Gameplay is not quite there for me.

As it is currently popular among gamers in my area (as of May 2011), would still be willing to play the odd game, plus I just like rolling a bunch of dice.

Best w/3-4, 2-4:
Including Factions, Faction Pack 1, and Expansion Pack 1, and Terran Exchange Faction

I like this game very much. It is well balanced, it plays smoothly, it plays well with all player counts (but 3-4 is best) and I like the art style and theme.  Components are also top notch.  Gameplay is dice rolling / action selection / area control.  Players roll dice and try to assemble Poker style hands (two of a kind, three of a kind, straight, etc) which determine eligibility of action spaces.  Extra dice can be purchased, along with power up cards.  The ultimate goal is to build colonies on the planet Maxwell, which scores you points.  Learning the board layout is the major hurdle for new players as there are 9 different actions available (not to mention another 9 different planet locations with buffs), but the iconography on the board is well done, and somewhat intuitive.  After two or three rounds, new players should be up to speed on mechanics at least.  If I had one complaint about this game, it would be that it lacks tension.  You almost always have someplace to play your ships (dice) since the game is well balanced, so in a four player session the game seems to drag out a little even with normal speed players.  I can see why the game was designed for 4 player max.

Unfortunately this game is not kind if you fall behind. It may be difficult to regain dice, resources can get stolen while trying to stock up, time between turns is proportionally longer with less interest in other's actions since there's little you can do each turn.

Decent game that is fun with some nice take that added (that isn't too much, in my opinion).

But it's very much about the end game and the turn order - the person finishing the game is most likely to win.

EDIT: After the second play I'm really disappointed. It is indeed all about the last person to finish up, and turn order and luck is very much a big issue there. It's really a crap-shoot as to who gets to finish the game - that should be the winner. Not always, but again, in a 4-player game the person last to have a turn will indeed also be last.

EDIT 2: Purchased on iOS - all games but 2 using iOS version.

Not a terrible worker placement game, and the dice rolling added a kind of surprise and tension to the game. Still the strategies that win standard worker placements applied here, and allowed me to dominate to victory without any real conflict or contest. About the best thing it has going for it is the ability to steal resources from other players--a much needed nastiness missing from most euros. This is far and away a superior worker placement game to the snoozefest that is Lords of Waterdeep.

I like the mechanics of the game, but my first playthrough left me a little frustrated due to my inability to roll pairs for expansion (which also negated my ability to use a 6 for direct colony placement), and was exacerbated by lots of stealing throughout the game.

 Easy to teach, easy to learn, fun to play, a lot of choices and plenty of player interaction with the raiding and blocking that goes on. The playing time and #of players is perfect for us. One more player would be nice, but I saw there is an expansion coming to add this. The theme is freakin awesome! little bit of old and new school sci fi.

One of the best "dice as workers" worker placement games. The only negative is the inevitable downtime waiting for your next turn.

I liked my first playing. Has elements of Kingsburg and Roll Through the Ages, and a whole bunch of other shit, that all works together really well. Even with the dice you always have an option to play one your turn. It may no be the option you wanted, but it is easy to mitigate your way out of trouble. The only "gotcha" is is you get hosed not rolling any doubles early on, or rolling them when the shipyard is full. But hey. They have some cool combos with the planet powers and cards to watch out for. Overall a cool gaming experience.

Ho-hum.  This game feels a bit stagnant to me. I feel like there aren't really any hard choices - like the decision tree of this game is small and simple.

Really cool and fun game.  Except that it takes FOREVER - especially if someone has AP.  You don't get to roll your dice until the start of your turn, so you can't really do any planning before that.  Meaning everyone's turns are long and there are long stretches of doing nothing.

It's a shame, too, because with a shorter game time, this would be awesome.

After only one play, I give this the same rating I gave another dice game, Troyes.  Of the two, Troyes seems more complicated and meaty than Alien Frontiers but perhaps not as easy to jump into and start having fun.  I will play this again but I'm beginning to realize I'm not a huge fan of board games where dice play a bigger role than other board mechanics (with the notable exception of games such as Perudo, Macao, and Roll Through the Ages).

Fun game but not something to take seriously. Similar to Kingsburg but with scope for player conflict (eg raiding other player's resources, blasting their ships out the sky, competing for planetary zones) and ganging up on the leader. Probably good with 3 players and played quickly. With not much to do for players while they wait for their turn, I can see some potential for this game to drag out and become annoying if players suffer from analysis paralysis. What makes this worse is that there is very little a player can do in terms of planning before they roll their dice on their turn - it's is a very tactical game. Overall, I think Alien Frontiers is better than Kingsburg, particularly the leader bashing capacity which is badly lacking in Kingsburg and makes Kingsburg prone to runaway leadership for luckier players. 

>>Update: This game is more fun than I initially thought. Its easy to teach and moves pretty quickly. I can see it getting a bit samey after 5-10 plays, though.

After 1 play: I think this game is well thought out and the iconography easily understood. The production quality is high. 
I need to play the game more to be convinced about the analysis paralysis during turns which gets progressively worse as someone nears the game end condiction. Perhaps a timer could be introduced to limit the only aspect of game which detracts from an otherwise great game.
After a second play this game has come alive and the closing stages were quick.So rating increased.
The Factions expansion speeds this game up, see my comments on the expansion.

Mildly thematic worker placement game. Excellent production. Good decisions, though mostly tactical. Repeated play leads me to believe that this game is more fun for me when I can access alien tech that allows me to manipulate my dice as I want. The expansion's alien tech cards are wildly varying in their utility, as so my enjoyment of the game fluctuated based on whether or not the cards offer what I fee like are interesting choices to achieve my goals.

RATING: 8
I quite enjoyed this game but didn't fall in love with it like I thought (wanted) to. I suspect the burden of expectation was at play here.

This dice allocation game is similar to others in that locations have requirements that must be rolled and then benefits are bestowed. But only 1 person can occupy the majority of locations at one time (like Kingsburg). 

The difference to Kingsburg though is that a player's dice will remain in place until a player's next turn, thus locking that position out to others. So timing is uber-important here and that leads to the need to plan a turn or two in advance.

Driving the game is the goal of collecting the most VP's and this is largely done by controlling sections of a moon. Thus area-control mechanics are in play in Alien Frontiers and several locations pertain to ships, fuelling them and getting them to the moon.

This very much reminded me of Mission Red Planet even if the mechanics vary greatly.

I'll probably end up getting it at some point purely because I am a dice allocation fan. But at present it sits on a par with Alea Iacta Est and Stone Age for me.

This is a good game.  However, if you already own Kingsburg (which I do), I fail to see the point of getting this title.  I may be biased since I already own Kingsburg (and the expansion - haven't played yet).
I like sci-fi better than fantasy.  However, for whatever reason Kingsburg just resonates better with me than Alien Frontiers.  I think it's because I enjoy the building row/track benefits in Kingsburg better than the alien artifacts / colonization benefits of Alien Frontiers.

Bottom line, good game that I'm willing to play.  And in the end I ended up getting it :)

Despite not having much of an arc to it, Alien Frontiers works. In many ways it replaced The Settlers of Catan for me, because aside from the back and forth negotiation, the two games share a lot of the same qualities and mechanisms. I do wish that the expansions were easier to get a hold of, as it feels like you're going to spend an arm and a leg trying to get everything. I still think I prefer the base game on its own, though I do like the hidden goals that Factions adds and the card row that Outer Belt adds. The factions I could take or leave due to how unclear the rules are on them. A solid worker placement game, but not an outstanding one.

Replaces Catan for me in a number of ways.

Alien Frontiers looks terrific and after a proper reading of the rules, one will probably find the game quite elegant and teachable. The reality of it is unfortunately frustrating on multiple counts.

Dice allocation is an interesting mechanic, but comes with the potential pitfall of your rolls determining an obvious course of action. In order to prevent that, the game refrains from granting every die value an optimal use (while strangely still mostly rewarding 6s higher than 1s). Instead, it tries to have you get a mix of high rolls, straight suits and pairs/three-of-a-kind... which do little for avoiding a pecking order of best moves. For instance lunar mineral being harder to harvest than solar energy, the raiding action is absolutely fantastic, because it seems to have been balanced for stealing an average of both resources. But in practice, stealing 4 minerals is not only the most efficient way to acquire minerals in the game, but also damages your opponents in an equal measure.

That's not even the biggest offender. Whenever you roll as pair while your bank contains the resources necessary to build a new die, you just always do, because more dice snowball into more actions per turn that accelerate getting even more dice. And while bash-that-leader-with-6-dice is a thing, on the opposite end of the spectrum someone behind in dice, especially if the gap formed early, can mostly kiss goodbye to their chances at winning. And losing a 90 minute game because of randomness in the first 10 is rather annoying.

Oh wait, did I say "90 minute"? That's the official duration printed on the box, but there's a catch: since the basic mechanics are bit too dependent on luck, technology cards have been implemented to allow you to do a wide variety of things. Notably dice manipulation. And between those effects, the one time trashing effect of the cards, the powers from regions controlled and the possible acquisition of new techs during your turn, calculating anything close to efficiency takes forever. Of course analysis paralysis is a player-driven problem; but here the game wants that problem to arise. Because as free die slots shift every turn and as you only reroll your dice at the beginning of your turn, you can't. Plan. Anything. Ahead. Of. Your. Turn. Which means that not only did I once witness a 15 minute turn, but I also had absolutely nothing to do during it. And when finally came my occasion to speed things up, I looked at my tech cards and my dice roll and spent a comparatively short time thinking, but which was still 100% downtime for everyone else.

Theoretically, this game has a lot of things I dislike. AP-prone, extremely tactical due to you having to make decisions based on dice you throw every turn, with fighting for area-control back and forth just to get that tiny one point.

However, what I like about this game is you actually have a goal to achieve. You are advancing every turns! Also, while tactical, dice results might lead you to change your plan. 

It's a 7.5 if you play with fast-paced players.

So far, I like it, plays well with two players or with four.  Nifty system of die-rolling and worker-placement, and I like how the turns roll forward instead of being round-based - that is, on my turn I take off my ships, roll them and place again, so there are always ships on the board.

Interesting worker placement game. The first dice-rolling worker placement I've tried. It may be surpassed by Troyes, but as I haven't played that game yet, this gets a tentative 8.

Randomness seems to affect the game, though I feel, one can work around this.

It's interesting to a degree, but I feel that after a few plays the exploration/novelty of the game may wear off.

RATING: 7
Players roll dice, which represent their ships, and use them to do a number of things, including gather resources, draw Alien Technology cards, get more ships or send their colonies onto a planet. 

It's a fun game, with a bit of area control, and trying to upgrade your resources. When reading the rules, I was concerned it would be a very light game, since you can potentially use ships to rob your opponents, or the cards allowed you to do various things. I enjoyed my plays with 3 player, and it might be even better with 2 players. Rating may go up with more plays, as I uncover more things. I am looking forward to more plays.

Played 2 and 3p.

Looks like it's going to be a simple game, but there are some really interesting choices. Gets very tense as the game goes on... especially when your spend two turns collecting valuable resources only for your nasty wife to steal them!

Get's pretty complex when there are multiple Alien cards in play (a good thing).

The "live" scoring is good and really adds tension which really builds during the game, but I think I would have liked some kind of hidden scoring at the end.  There seems to be a tendency of the winning player trying to end the game as quick as possible. I guess though its down to the other players to see and prevent this.  Just not that used to this scoring mechanic I suppose.

Enjoyed this game more than I thought I would from looking at the rules. Has a bit of take that with the raiders which I didn't like, but it tends to work out even over the course of the game, and is necessary to keep people from stockpiling goods. Feels like there's at least 4 or 5 viable strategies to explore.

Downtime is a bit rough once people accumulate a few dice. Would prefer to play this only with 3 players.

Space themed game aimed at establishing the most colonies to trigger game end, in which player with most victory points wins. Dice are rolled, then game proceeds as a worker placement game, but you need the correct numbers/ combinations to trigger certain effects. Two in game resources, solar energy (orange dscs) and ore (? grey cubes) need to be carefully managed. 

PROS
-Science fiction authors implemented in the names of different locations (e.g. Asimov crater).
-Technology cards attempt to minimize luck in the game. 
-Great board design and artwork. 

CONS
-Game is like Yahtzee.
-Difficult to plan ahead, meaning lots of downtime (roll then analysis paralysis).
-Usually just doing what the dice tell you. 
-First person to get extra dice usually wins, which is how I won my first game (based on luck, rolling doubles).
-Technology cards often seem convoluted and some are much better than others.
-Some technology cards prolong the game by excessive account keeping and continual stealing/ inhibiting others.
-Hard to manage resources, you may have the necessary resources to establish a colony for many turns but cant because you cannot trigger the required dice roll or the spot is always taken by those who can reproducibly. Then someone steals your resources (followed by you rolling a now useless dice combo letting you establish a colony!).

Pretty neat worker placement game with interesting dice management mechanics. It seems to have more interaction than some other WP games I know, though I wasn't crazy about it, since there was some targeting. The dice tie-in didn't make sense, but I didn't mind much since it was still a very lively game that I enjoyed playing.

Alien Frontiers is plain-old dull. By forcing each player to place all their Ships every one of their turns, AF removes all tension and the appearance of player interaction. Paying attention to other player's turns is boring and strategically useless. A player only needs to assess the board when their turn arrives.

AF has a runaway leader problem. Although the issue is potentially mitigated by the randomness of dice rolls, if a player rolls at least one 6 and a pair of any number consistently there is no way for others to keep pace. Basically, whoever is last to the Shipyard location will lose the game.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A strategic, area-control dice game.  Come up with different sets of rolls to be able to use different action areas on the board that will allow you to do different things during the course of the game.  One action gives you resources, another action gives you more dice to roll, and another one allows you to place your pawns onto the planet everyone is trying to control.  Like most respected dice games, no matter what you roll you should be able to contend for the win with smart play.

One of my bigger qualms with this game is that when someone takes the lead in an area that someone else was in the lead in, the new leader gets +1, and the person that just lost control gets -1.  A 2 point swing would not be such a big deal, however the game is played to 4 points, which is huge.  

The game is fun and enjoyable, if a little on the lighter side, and I would certainly play it again.

Wish I could give this game a ratings range (to wit, 4-7). It can be awful and it can be fun. On the low end, as expansions are added, it gets so Ameritrashy, and as player count inches up from 3, it loses fundensity rapidly. With 3, and with a limit on the extra modules, it can play fun and fast.

A nice dice-allocation game, not too heavy. At the beginning, luck can play quite a factor but once you get more ships, it's not so bad. Unfortunately you have to get lucky to get more ships!

The criticisms I read here about the dominance of takedown effects, and lack of area-control feel, ring true, though I suspect it would take a few more plays (than 1) to get tired of it.

Even with the luck aspect of the dice, I think this one is pretty good. It can be a bit too long to be enjoyable sometimes, but that may change just with more familiarity. I don't think you're ever completely out of options, most of the time, but some turns can seem unsatisfying.

Dice rolling and allocating worker placement space game. I love dice games and worker placement games, and sci-fi is my favourite theme, this game was must for me.

The game is nastier than it initially seems, you can be stolen, and the area control feature is very flimsy.

Adding lots of workers is not the only way to go. The game seems to be very balanced, with several paths to victory.

On the bad side, the game drags a bit, because:
- You can't plan moves in advance. You have to wait until you roll your dice to see what are your options -> makes turns longer.
- There's nothing you can do during off turns. 
- Things can change very fast, you can be denied the control of a couple areas, stolen, etc., especially in the lasts turns.

Alien Frontiers is a decent, lightweight dice-roller. It’s pretty quick and the luck of the dice shouldn’t put people off, as rolling high isn’t necessarily good (though not rolling any doubles throughout the game could be a problem). There is a fair bit of tit for tat in the game and plenty of opportunity to have a pop at your fellow players - all good, however, I felt the gap between winning and losing was rather too slender, so that the mixture of area majority and ‘take that’ meant the outcome could be a little arbitrary. You only get to place a maximum of six colonies throughout the game, so the territories don’t change hands very often. When they do it’s a two point swing. With an average winning score of 8, deciding who to knobble can quickly lead to bash the leader (I’m OK with that) or king making (not so much). Still, I’ve only played it once and my worries may not be as prevalent as I imagine.

I am very impressed with [i]Alien Frontiers[/i]- my initial rating is a 7 and it is likely to rise. The game seems nicely balanced and luck is minimal. The dice mechanics are really interesting - using up dice to gain colonies creates a sometimes difficult decision. The art and graphics are excellent too.
[i]Several plays later[/i]: one criticism is that there is little to do between turns (except maybe heckle opponents) because there is no way to plan until the dice are rolled. This does slow the game. Rating unchanged (7).

OK game.  Uses dice to control worker placement (doubles, triples, run of 3, minimum values, and higher values get more resources). Lots of "take that" player interaction in occupying work sites so others can't use them.  A bit of area control on a planet.  Controlling the area grants the owner a bonus when using the adjacent work site.  Resources are the dice (3 ships to start, 6 max), ore, fuel, cards (gain benefits when use), and colonies.  When a player plays his last colony the game ends and the winner is the one with the most points (# of colonies + # of controlled areas + any card bonuses (2)).

After many plays I like this one a bit more (bumped from 7.5 to 8).  Plays better with more but even with 2 is good.    Does have a bit of a run away leader problem.  Some combinations of cards/planet zone powers are "too" powerful and take combined action from other players to stop.

I love the charming 60'ies look, and love the the game even more! Of course, dice as space ships seems a bit odd, nevertheless it's very interactive and tactically demanding.

I also enjoy the various "take that!" actions which add salt and pepper to the game.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (6):[/COLOR]

[i]I really didn't enjoy my first play, especially since my kids really weren't having fun. A buddy of mine really wanted to play so I tried it again and enjoyed it a bit more. The design itself feels dated and really doesn't do anything that makes you want to keep bringing it to the table. I love the area control aspect of the game, but I don't enjoy the resource management since the decision space is so limited. This wouldn't be a deal breaker if the game was quick, but it can go long and begin to feel quite repetitive. Definitely not a game that I need to play again.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (6):[/COLOR]

[i]I have been wanting to play this for years and my buddy Mat let me borrow it to play with my kids. I really thought they would love it and I thought I would like it a lot more than Kingsburg.

After playing for over an hour I could tell that my kids were getting bored (mind you long games are not an issue with my kids, they'll sit and play Agricola with me). In the end nothing about the game grabbed them and they felt like they were repeating the same actions over and over and I kind of agree. There really isn't much variety in the actions you can take. Also waiting for each person to place all their dice gets old fast, especially by the time my daughter had 7 dice. I much prefer Kingsburg because there are a lot more choices you can make when placing your dice (a total of 16 advisers versus maybe 8 - 10 spaces in AF).

I would play it again if someone requested it, but it's not a game I would consider adding to our collection (I am grateful that I got a chance to try it out before buying it).[/i]

Worker placement with dice (or sets of dice) used to claim action spaces. It's an ongoing worker placement - there's no end of round where you take your workers back, you just pick them up at the start of your turn, roll them, and then those spaces are blocked until your next turn.

Sometimes a low roll is good, sometimes a high roll, or a set or a run etc., but you have no control over what you roll so you're largely at the mercy of the dice, and then it's a case of puzzling out what your best move is., often there's only 1 or 2 good ways of using your dice.

I also felt that there was not enough asymmetry between the players positions - everything was about the same value to everyone. The game would have benefited from more/stronger special powers.

A jazzed up To Court The King with some resource gathering stuff to get you into the area majorities race to earn the VPs needed to win, with enough "take that" to keep things level throughout until someone sneaks over the line. It has the same downside though, pure downtime, but here's it's magnified because the game takes 3 times longer. Your own turn is interesting though and that can save the game. Roll your dice. Allocate them to boxes on the board worker-placement style (blocking spaces from other players until you retrieve the dice at start of next turn) earn resources, steal them, or pay those resources in various ways to either get more dice or to parachute meeples onto the board into the area majority areas. Or go for tech cards which will allow you to manipulate dice rolls, acquire resources, etc, in all sorts of different ways. If you've acquired smartly, by mid-game your turns should be a pretty interesting turn of dice manipulation options and hopefully you've developed a means of getting meeples onto the board more efficiently than the other players. If you can do it under the radar so that you're stolen from just as much as the others, all the better. Towards the end, you can also discard those tech cards to move meeples between areas, which can be devastating to your score if you're a perceived or actual leader and you're the one hit. So the game all levels up, and hopefully your engine is still intact enough (after card stealing as well) to get you the win, getting your last meeple out there faster than anyone else at a point when you're in a position to manipulate the meeples / score to get you over the line scorewise. It's decent enough on your turns, but pretty boring watching analysis paralyis develop on other players' turns as their decision trees broaden. No story, no tension arc, no drama, this is just a long dice game. I'd like to think you can do clever plans towards the end to get you the win in a rush, but with all the take-that (which gets more prevalent as the game develops and people have more dice to spare, particularly in a 4 player, less with less), you can't take any planning too seriously. Having said that, I'm pretty sure this game doesn't want to be taken too seriously anyway and I'm generally happy to play it because I know my own turns will be interesting.

A bunch of sci-fi literature geeks get together, and brainstorm ideas for a game:
- must be a tribute to great sci-fi authors.
- dice become ships in space.
- it's a worker-placement/area-control game that can feel a bit like Rummikub.
- lets throw in cards and trade goods.
- have rocketships as scorekeeping pieces.
The result would be much like this awesome game. 

This game fired Settlers of Catan for me as my "go to" game. Alien Frontiers is also great with and without the expansions.

Okay for 2 players, but can have a runaway leader problem.

Quite complex, with multiple card powers, and multiple base powers. Possible AP when trying to compute the optimal moves for a turn. Must be played quite cutthroat. Lasted too long (our 4p game was well over 2 hours, and with AP-prone players could be way longer).

Don't like waiting for people to allocate dice, don't like swingy area control, don't like being unable to plan my turn in advance - in large games, any amount of pre-planning you can do is nullified by a combination of multiplayer chaos and dice that have to sit on the board as you rolled them until your turn.

This is the one game in my collection which I cannot decide whether I like or simply tolerate.
It's so much meaner than what I normally enjoy and the play time balloons greatly with larger player counts without much to show for it (I tend to limit colonies more tightly with the larger player counts than what is suggested in the rulebook to overcome this issue).
The artwork is some of the best in the business in my eyes and pokes the same part of my brain that Race for the Galaxy does.
I feel I need to play it a few more times with some different crowds to see whether it stays or goes.

Played once. There aren't too many interesting or difficult decisions to make here, but the game is enjoyable as the game moves along quite quickly. I think the winner will often be determined by luck---not because of the dice, but because the scores are so close that someone can jump ahead with the last move of the game.

Although I'm not dying to play again, it's the sort of game that you could bring to the table with a wide range of people.

Played the game twice last night with 3 other friends. We were addicted quickly. It's one of the best game mechanics we've played.

The game is phenomenal fun. Some interesting (and positive) aspects of our games were:

* The fact you rely on the luck of the dice, makes it very difficult to hold grudges against other players.
* The final rounds of a game are tons of fun because everyone is calculating each and every move to ensure maximum VP upon game end.
* The 'tie' rules were a great help in aiding us to determine how many points we receive for our tournament system.
* The game contains top notch components and is a solid design with more than enough plastic bags for storage.

Props to the designers, artists, play-testers, and manufacturers of the game.

This game has received the highest rating I've given a game on BoardGameGeek!

RATING: 8
A nice sci-fi game on building your economy by acquiring ships, constructing colonies, and competing for region control.  The use of dice as ships is a new mechanism (for me, anyway) that works pretty damned well, with different available to the players with different rolls.  Technology cards provide you ways to modify die rolls, affect the map, and otherwise influence play.

The one potentially valid shortcoming this game has is that the use of dice does mean that someone is likely to encounter the "If I'd only rolled a total that was 1 higher."  Or "If I'd only rolled another 6."  This is a potential problem, but not a large one since every player is likely to encounter it at some time throughout the game.  If these types of issues bother you, focus on acquiring technology that allows you to manipulate your ships (dice).  Or find something else. :)

Nice, light, perhaps a bit long for some.  But easy to teach and play and fun with excellent production values.

I have soloed through a game and played four with real opponents.  So far, I really like it.  Hits a sweet spot in terms of strategy/tactics and playtime.  Very smooth, intuitive gameplay with a lot of choices to make each turn.  Game is deeper than it looks at first glance.

12/18/12: Downtime is a potential issue, I'm finding.  There is little to do between turns because until you roll your own dice, you cannot do any meaningful advance planning while other turns are happening.

Your ships are dice and you use them to try and populate a planet. Based on the dice roll combinations, you can use your ships to get other ships, set up colonies and get special abilities. you can also block others or even attack them with some cards. An very cool mechanic that works well, but since the points are visible, the leader is always getting attacked.

I'd play this if someone else really wanted to but I've just found the game a little boring when I've played it. I like the idea, using dice as workers and also using different combinations for different actions, but I found that because of that you aren't really left with many choices per turn, there always seems to be an obvious way to go. I'd take The Castles of Burgundy over this any day.

I like the dice rolling and allocation aspect.  I like the theme and artwork.  I don't like the fact that the difference between winning and losing can come down to stealing a card or discarding a card to switch a couple of colonies.  If such actions were reducing scores by a couple of points when the scores were in the fifties say I would have no problem but when a winning score can be 9 points its too powerful.  I hate the way the the game ends immediately a player places their last colony - to do so is very likely to give the player the game.  Thinking about it the game may play better as a pure race game - the first to build all their colonies wins (strip out points for holding cards, owning the positron field or points for holding the majority in a planet area).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Only off of one play (with 5 players).  A lot of take that in this game with direct attacks, being really screwed as last player due to all dice being allocated at once, and A LOT of AP.  It was a really long game for a game with kingmaking in my opinion. It could be better with fewer players however.

I'm usually not a fan of the "roll dice and assign them" sub-genre, but this one really stood out as a winner.  I really liked how the dice-rolling wasn't all done at once--each player rolls his dice on his turn, and the spots he takes with those dice stay "blocked" until his next turn.  The flow of the game worked well too--you can get more dice to be able to do more things on your turn, but often to secure points you needed to give up those dice.  The various options on the board were varied and fun, and provided a good bit of interaction between players.

Comment: What a simple, yet entertaining game. The special power cards really bump this game up a notch and I like it more than Kingsburg. I do think that you need the expansion for this game to have it really stretch it's legs, but it's solid on it's own for a few plays. I like this game with more players, but the problem is downtime. Now it's not as bad when you have a beer on hand and the other players know the game, but playing with all new players can really drag the game down. You literally can't do any planning until your turn. This is my biggest knock against the game and what would bring this up to an 8.

Optimal Player Count: 4 > 3 > 2

Extras: Sleeved all the cards in FFG Silver sleeves. The upgrade pack is also included to make the game that much nicer looking. Mind Control Promo also included.

Definitely a better game if played with the right analytical minds...players that are engaged and know when to keep succeeding strategies of other players in check. One bad seed can break the balance of the game. The game can be a bit too long for what it is if played with AP prone players.  Could perhaps benefit from a player turn time limit/egg timer. Players that hoard cards can slow down the game...especially if new to the game and unfamiliar with abilities. As a new player variant, perhaps a  5 tech card limit of active cards ... .with cards in a player's play area (of a players choice) >5 being buried in one of 5 piles (buried card actions can not be actioned. Buried cards may be still be stolen by opposition).

One of my favorite worker placements and harder to obtain.

It's fairly interactive with the blocking, stealing, and area control.  I like how you have more options with your dice over Kingsburg.  I think how they have the dice implemented and times you can go down dice and have to do things to get them back.  It's easy to learn, plays fast, and has some depth.

The power cards and area control aspect may have some chaos and different than standard worker placement games.

Good example of American board game design.  Clever gameplay with lots of interesting decisions, plus a giant kingmaker element so that none of your strategy matters: it's just a question of whether someone decides to screw you over.

This game is beautifully produced and has very nice choices, shame the game is limited by your dice rolls. The problem is the massive down time and AP that ensures. For me it is a light fun game, which depends on how players react to the area control aspect. To wait for 5 minutes per player after they roll their dice is just unacceptable, shame it happens with players who are not AP prone. Unlike other dice game of this weight, luck is too important. I might as well go to the casino and play some craps.

Didn't make the cut due to the down time and other dice games out there which are just more fun and yes strategic. 

On another note the recent Kick starter for the third edition with the space ship dice just saddened me. Dice=Cubes :) Happy time;)

Very nice art though, that 50s sci-fi theme is very appealing. The scoring is also very well thought out, it makes it easy to counter moves and keep the game tense. Kind of mitigates the runaway leader issue of some games. But finally sold it to make room for other games that are more to my taste.

Fun little dice-based resource management game. I like it more than Kingsburg due to the variability added by the alien tech cards. You're basically collecting resources to colonize a planet-- using bonuses from the colonies and alien tech cards to give you a little boost when needed. I would definitely choose this over Kingsburg every time.

With the addition of the Factions expansion (which makes deciding to end the game a little more tricky and adds replayability) the rating goes up half a point to a 7.5 for me.

Not sure about this one. The first few turns I tried to plan ahead, that doesn't really seem to work. A purely tactical approach works (just do whatever seems optimal in your own turn), but that means other players turns aren't very interesting... and for that the game has a few too many options. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A major problem with this game is that each player rolls his dice at the start of his turn, so any forward planning is impossible. Hence, the game has a ton of downtime during which players are doing nothing and cannot plan their next turns...

That said, I like the game well enough. There is opportunity for clever play. The length is about right for a game of this weight. 

There is one potential fix I heard proposed: Each player gets a 2nd set of dice in his color and a player screen. At the end of a player's turn, he rolls the dice behind the screen. While it would require a few tweaks, this would mean that players could largely plan turns in advance. I might even bump up the rating on this if such a system worked.

RATING: 7
I would play this again, but to me it doesn't beat Kingsburg.  I think, as with Macao, dice-selection and game-changing cards don't go very well together.  And mixing in area-control really doesn't help.

I also think that the dice rolling wasn't tense enough.  Because there's not a wish to roll a certain thing.  You hope for doubles or hope for a straight of three, but somehow that's not as exciting as rolling for high numbers or something like that.

The board is brilliant and makes the game easy to play. Rolling dice is always fun.

Alien Frontiers is certainly a fine worker placement game, light to medium heavy with a wonderful 1950's style science fiction theme splendidly applied. But the gameplay is tactical rather than strategic which irks me somewhat, the impossibility to plan out your next move in advance also makes for some dull moments as you are waiting for your turn. But in spite of the strategic shortcomings I don't mind playing the game and am looking forward to try out some of the expansions

I get to play this game at my local meetup today. As expected this is a good solid game based on the video reviews I've watched. The dice aspect feels like Kingsburg, but rolling high doesn't win you the game. (unlike Kingsburg if you roll high you usually can win) This game packs a lot of tension. The winner was really determined in the last 2 rounds of the game. 

To me, this game has too much of "take that" in the game. This is not a point salad Euro where everyone is off making points and compare their result at the end. To do well you will have to be willing to battle it out. The guy next to me felt my attack was personal but it is actually not. So we attacked each other and at the end he lost the game by the tie breaker.

I will be happy to play it again but don't feel I need to own this game to play with my family.

A space themed worker placement game, where the workers are dice. Challenges are raised through the dice as you can only place certain ones certain places, depending on what you rolled.

For me, this is one of the best worker placements in the genre.
Its easy to explain, even to non-gamers and they cath the strategy right away.

Play this with fast paced gamers though, cause once you get 5-6 ships (dice), the game becomes very AP prone.

Lastly the components are gorgeous with tuckboxes to put everything neathly away!
This one is a keeper

Easy Kingsburg-like mechanics meet a tactical game. You can explain the rules in 10 minutes, but then there's several layers of depth such a blocking, leveraging powers, and dominating territories. The end game is a bit dodgy in that someone can rise from the bottom and end the game as victor by setting up several colonies at one turn. However, the game is analytical, fun, and with just the right amount of player take-this and defend-that to it. I can't think of anything I would add to it to make it better.

RATING: 3
Horrible game for 4 players. Lengthy downtime, and no preplanning is possible as you can't roll until your turn.

The only way to reliably have less reliance on luck is to gain extra ships (which takes luck) or to buy the artifacts that allow for some mitigation. (which takes luck) The players with extra ships will get more actions, and have better odds of ideal roles. The fourth player is liable to be shut out of getting a new ship for multiple rounds. 

The game has a problem with runaway leaders, forcing players to pile on the leader or king-make.

Any combination of bad rolls and blocking players will ensure you can do nothing useful on your actions.

The Pirate Raid is game-breakingly overpowered. If your dice allow it and you can steal one or more ore, always take this action.

The "balancing" mechanic for going last in a four-player game is absolute rubbish. (Be the only player to take your first turn with all of the best spaces claimed, to get a pittance of fuel that helps with next to nothing. Seriously? I would recommend that you give the 2nd player one fuel, the 3rd player one ore, and the 4th player starts with one of each, except that it would just be that much MORE of a swing to the first player that rolls a straight and raids on his first turn.)

This would be a 10 if first player didn't have such a disadvantage in 2 player and it wasn't quite so brutal. I think factions will make this a 10 tho.

RATING: 8
Simple, fast-paced (particularly if played with 2 or 3 players) game, that is a mix of worker placement and area control with cool components. The workers (thematically called "ships") are actually die, that are rolled each turn and used to activate different spaces in the board. Rolls can be modified via cards but nearly all rolls are of some use.

Gameplay feel changes as the game evolves. In the early game, with few dice and few or no cards to change the rolls, you have to make the most out of limited choices. By the endgame players have more dice and roll-changing cards to boot, so you can turn almost any roll into anything you want - and it becomes much more an exercise of finding the most efficient allocation for the dice among several promising options.

I'm curious to see how factions with special powers alter the game.

Really great game. Lots of tension, very simple game play, and many meaningful short- and long-term decisions to make.  Plenty of tools for player interaction and being reactionary.  There is certainly a king-making component toward the end, thus you do need a smart group of players.

RATING: 6
This game suffers from some glaring design flaws that prevent it from being the great medium-length filler I'd hoped it would be.

Inability to plan for your next turn makes AP and downtime horrendous. It's not so bad in the early turns where players have few dice and Alien Tech. But as those increase, so does the downtime.

The game is simply too long for its weight. Our 4p game took roughly 2.5 hours plus explanation.

There is too much bash-the-leader such that the winner can feel they got there by being lucky or not being picked on as much as the other players were.

Early ships are too important, meaning there is really only one correct strategy--gather more ships early, establish colonies late.

What prevents this game from being a 4 or even a 3 is that it has a cool theme and very nice graphic design. It is a pleasure to look at and interact with the components, even if the game itself is mediocre.

A ok dice-as-workers placement game, but I'm not sure it wins against it's cousins Kingsburg and Troyes.

The game has an area control aspect, but very few bits to area control with, and it's also the game timer, so it feels strange to be unable to realistically take a district that has only two tokens in it.

RATING: 7
It has the dice-as-workers of Kingsburg combined with the theme, special powers and chunky scoring of Cosmic Encounter. I like it a lot more than Kingsburg because there seem to be more ways of using your dice, and low rolls don't seem to be a problem at all (oh, and there are no effing Orcs). I enjoyed how you could put creative strings of actions together involving the colony powers and alien techs, and how you often seemed to be 'just one short' of the perfect plan. This could allow AP to set in once players have lots of dice, but this really isn't the sort of game you should be agonising over. After one play, Alien Frontiers seems to be the great middleweight dice-based worker placement game that Stone Age should have been.

No ez megosztó volt. (kis mértékben)
Végig izgalmas és kicsit konfrontatív a játék, sokat lehet mérgelődni ezen, de olyan nagyon mégsem volt komoly befolyásoló tényező, hogy végig én szívtam.:)
De a végeredményt mégiscsak befolyásolta, mert a folyamatos kirablásom miatt lettem végül második. Szerintem. :D 
A megosztást az váltotta ki, hogy a vége feltétel olyan mértékben volt a kockadobásra utalva, hogy ez befolyásolta a megítélését a játéknak és mivel azonnal véget ér ilyen esetben a játék, még javításra sincs esély. Igaz, de én úgy látom, hogy a kártyák, területek birtoklásával a kocka dobás megfelelő időben kívánt eredménye létrehozható.Ha akkor azt dobják meg, amit szerettek volna, abban az esetben utolsó is lehettem volna. De épp ez adta azt a kellemes izgalmat, hogy mikor dobbantson az ember. Hasonló ütemjátéknak látom mint a power gridet, igaz ott a kockadobás nem feltétlenül befolyásoló tényező. Mert kb nincs.:D Itt bizony ezzel is számolni kell.

RATING: 7
I probably rated this a point below what I should have, but I didn't want to enter a .5 rating so I made a choice. Oh well.

Alien Frontiers makes worker placement with "variable" workers actually function in an entertaining way. Unlike a game like Kingsburg, where higher rolls are genrally better, you can still make relevant plays with low rolls.

Also, the components in the game are great. At least in the 4th edition, there are tuckboxes for individual player components and the other game materials. This is great, and more game manufacturers should implement this if they're too pressed to make custom inserts for games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.75
Alien frontiers took the Kingsburg mechanics and propelled it into space. Alas, in my experience, making the players use all their dice at once (instead of taking turns as in Kingsburg) generates way too much downtime and AP. That being said, I do prefer Kingsburg.

Pros and Cons as a 2-Player Game

Pros:
- Just plain fun. I love rolling dice.
- Fairly quick setup.
- Your options are controlled by the roll of the dice, but we almost never felt stuck.
- Beautiful game with a fun theme.
- Lots of "take that" options without feeling like you're getting picked on.

Cons:
- While still fun for 2, it lacks a lot of the struggle to control regions on the planet. See below for some (untested) ideas to improve this.
- The "Factions" may not work well for 2. There's already too little competition for docking stations; wouldn't want to add even more.

Unsure:
- Kind of a money sink. My completionism required I buy the upgrade pack, Factions, Factions#1, AND the kickstarter rocket dice AND the 4th printing.

== 2013-03-03 - R:8.9

I wanted to play this a few more times before giving it a rating, but given how much time I spend just thinking about it, I think I'm going to go ahead and prematurely admit I love it. This is what I wanted 'To Court the King' to feel like. Played once with my wife and once with my brother.

== 2013-04-07 - R:8.9

Have now played about six times, all 2 player. There's something missing in a 2p game; there's nowhere near enough competition for regions on the planet and some of the agenda cards are hard to satisfy with only 2. I've been thinking up some [article=12269837]variants[/article] to help.

== 2013-04-20 - R:8.9

One of the more common criticisms of dice games where you can increase the number of dice you can roll is that the first person to luck out and get an extra die has a pretty big advantage. This is an even larger issue in Alien Frontiers because when you get your extra ships, you also hinder the ability of others to immediately catch up. Here's a variant I haven't tried. "Everyone starts with six ships". This would also make for a pretty quick game.

RATING: 1
Pros:
1. Dice placement is always fun (or so I thought)
2. Decent amount of player interaction

Cons:
1. Take that is very strong in this game and allows you to pick on one player
2. The best spot in the game is the outpost that allows you to steal 4 resources from another player. It can take upwards of 5 turns to gain 4 resources, but they can be taken away in 1 turn.
3. No difficult decisions. There are very few decisions to be made in this game making what to do with the dice very easy.

Summary: Honestly, the alien outpost breaks this game. Anytime you can play that spot, you have to play that spot. That spot has 3 positives, you gain 4 resources (the most efficient way to gain resources), you protect yourself from that spot, and you severely injure another player by taking all his resources. The player who is able to play that spot the most will win this game the very large majority of the time. This classifies the game as broken to me. The people who love this game are the people who haven't done the math to see how badly the outpost breaks the game. Even ignoring the outpost, there are no tough decisions in this game. The majority of the time what you need to do based on your dice roll is very clear meaning this game would still be below a 5 even without the broken mechanic. There's so many better dice placement games to play, so just skip this one.

Un jeu agréable à regarder, avec des règles simples. J'y ai joué à 4, il devient difficile de trouver des actions disponibles. Beaucoup d'attente, surtout vers la fin quand les joueurs combinent leurs technologies (leurs cartes aliens) et l'ennui se fait vraiment sentir puisqu'il est impossible de planifier quoi que ce soit. Le jeu était un peu trop long (environ 2h). Un peu trop d’agressivité à mon goût (surtout si la moitié des joueurs a une carte protection).

I played a two player game. I think this one needs three to four. Also, it just wasn't as great as what I thought it was going to be. My own fault for hyping it up so much in my mind. This rating is definitely tentative, as it could go up after a play with 3-4. But for a 2 player game, this just feels like rolling dice and screwing over the other player. It would be nice to spread some of that luck and meanness out across more players, and to have different players at different locations to make the board a little tighter. If I had a good three or four player experience, I could easily see this one going up to a 7.5, but I don't think it could get any better than that.

I picked this one up initially because I thought it would be Kingsburg in space.  Turns out that I like it a lot better than I do Kingsburg. There's more player interaction, the decisions you need to make seem more important + I really dig the theme. At times the game can be cut throat which wouldn't appeal to everyone. This is by far my favorite dice rolling game.

Update: I've now played it 4 times and although I still really enjoy it I have lowered my rating a little bit.  Just starting to feel too repetitive.  Perhaps I need to mix up my strategy more.

Great use of dice workers mechanic but some things get annoying for me. Stealing resources is realy huge, you need to like it very much, Settler of Catan are not even close in this menner. I would love more variety of cards as well, almost every game you go through whole deck and there is double of every card i guess, and many are not too different at all. Moreover everytime i play, game drags a lot, it might be due to a fact that each time it was late and with somewhat the same group of people with AP in one case.

A very solid dice game. I especially like the variety of actions on the board and all the different alien tech cards. This is a game that is easy to learn but take times to master. It's common for players to jump the gun and run for the finish, just to wind up getting pummeled by the rest of the players. There's a strong sense of "take down the leader" in this game, which can sometimes turn a 1 hour game in a much longer affair. A good game of Frontiers is very entertaining- so learn the right time to make your move for the win!

UPDATE: With the expansions this goes from a good game to a GREAT game. Now one of my favorites.

Similiar to kingsburg in that you roll dice and asign the as workers to various slots/actions. While there is much more to do with your dice (even low rolls) than in kingsburg, it still relies on dice. At the end of the day, it just takes a lot of meaning out of the strategy for me.

The most analytical dice game I've ever played.  Just an excellent way to utilize dice without the dice roll completely screwing you.  Each turn plays almost like a puzzle.  Though there are some strategic directions overall it appears how you tactically use you dice that is most important. Just a great thinking game, however, this game can be slowed by analysis paralysis thus extensive downtime is not unusual.  With two players it's not bad I imagine 4 players it can be really bad.  This is because there is not much to think about while others are playing because you need to know you dice roll and you don't know what spots will be taken before the start of you your turn.  Very unique but not as fun as the hype  for me but a very good game.  Update:  played with Factions and this changes the game a little from a pure tactile same-y type game and adds more a strategic element as you try to optimize your factions powers.  Game is an 8.3 with Factions which is really the only way I'd play from now on.  It give the game some tactical/strategical balance.

Just a great thinking game, however, this game can be slowed by analysis paralysis thus extensive downtime is not unusual.  With two players it's not bad I imagine 4 players it can be really bad.  This is because there is not much to think about while others are playing because you need to know you dice roll and you don't know what spots will be taken before the start of you your turn.  Very unique but not as fun as the hype  for me but a very good game.  Update:  played with Factions and this changes the game a little from a pure tactile same-y type game and adds more a strategic element as you try to optimize your factions powers.  Game is an 8.3 with Factions which is really the only way I'd play from now on.  It give the game some tactical/strategical balance.

Really well made worker placements.  Love the use of poker like hands but with the use of dice to be placed on boards.  Also has area control too.  Art is also great.

Gorgeous game- great production quality.  One play so far, though it only arrived tonight;)  Learning game was enjoyable, and we're looking forward to trying again now that we have an idea of what's going on.  

I like the fact that there never seemed to be nothing you could do with your dice- there were always options. Also enjoyed the alien tech- it wasn't too hard to get what you needed to make rolls more useful etc...

Several more plays in, this is a solid game.  Does tend to induce AP in my husband, but so does 'Go Fish'.

RATING: 6
Games with dice are having a bit of a comeback, which is good because I grew up with games that used dice and lots of them were very good games. The best ones, games like Kingsburg, have taken on board Euro sensibilities and use the dice to limit a players options while not having any one dice roll strictly better or worse than another. 
Alien Frontiers doesn't do any of that.When you roll the dice it gives a huge range of possible actions, because the dice can be applied in a variety of orders and can usually be manipulated in a variety of ways. And generally some dice rolls are just strictly better than others. 
This doesn't make Alien Frontiers a bad game, you have a lot of fun trying to get your six colonies placed (this is very much Cosmic Encounters meets Kingsburg) and building up your stock of special powers and resources. However, the game still hinges a lot on the dice, roll well and win. And the multitude of choices immediately after the roll means it is a bad game if a player suffers from analysis paralysis.

RATING: 7
At its core, this is a very good game, but it's marred by three main problems:

1. It's too easy to hog the two most powerful spaces: stealing and terraforming.  With the right alien artifacts, you can hold a monopoly on these spaces, and easily dominate the game.  

2. The game suffers from a version of middle child syndrome, where it's not quite a casual game and not quite a solid strategic one either.  It's too long to be casual, and it's too random (both from dice rolls and opponents randomly stealing what you have) to be strategic.

3. There's too much time between turns.  Since you won't know what you have to work with until it's your turn and you roll, there's nothing for you to do but sit and wait for your turn, and if your opponent's the kind to take his time, it can get really boring.

All that said, there is a lot of great aspects to the game.  The gameplay is streamlined, balanced, and a lot of fun.  I just wish it was either a bit deeper, or a bit quicker.

RATING: 6
This game has plenty to like about it, and indeed I really enjoyed it when we first got it. But my enthusiasm for it has faded so much that, while I still respect it as a good design, I almost never want to play it any more.

First, the good points: the basic worker-placement-with-dice mechanics, where each action spot requires particular combinations of dice (pairs, sequences, higher values than previously placed, and so on), along with the ability to manipulate your dice by use of the Alien Tech cards, are still very fresh-feeling, and allow for a good mix of randomness and strategy. It always feels satisfying to turn an unpromising-looking roll into a good turn by finding a good "combo" (involving cards and the right sequence of actions to take). The fact that each of the territories which you can control on the planet gives you a particular special ability - which can be taken away by other players depriving you of control - adds another welcome aspect to the game.

But for me personally, the randomness is a bit too much. In the early game - as in many worker-placement games - the biggest priority is getting an extra worker (here you do that at the "shipyard" spot, as workers represent spaceships). This requires you to roll a pair - but, even in conjunction with the dice-manipulation abilities on the cards, it can happen that one player is unable to do this for several turns in a row at the start of the game (of course, it's much harder when you start with only 3 dice), which tends to put them more or less out of the game. And in the late game, it's even worse than this, because the key spot then is the "terraforming station" (place a 6 to place a new colony - the things which basically you are racing to put on the planet in order to win the game - at the cost of losing that die, but that hardly matters if it's your last or second-to-last colony). The die placed there still locks everyone else out of that spot, as it doesn't actually leave the board until the start of your next turn - so if you can roll a 6 (or create one from your roll and tech card abilities) every turn at the end of the game, you can basically lock down a win.

In addition to this, the game is extremely AP-prone, because of the sheer number of different possibilities you have when you have 5 or 6 dice and 3 or 4 alien tech cards, not to mention that the order in which you place your dice to get stuff can be very important (you can place a couple first to get a new tech card and then instantly use it, for example). In combination with the fact that you only roll your dice at the start of your turn, thus not allowing you to really plan your turn in advance, this tends to reduce things to a snail's pace as the game goes on. And this is a particular flaw in a game which is clearly intended to be a very interactive "social" type game. (There are plenty of "take that" aspects, which while not especially vicious, can create plenty of table talk.)

Overall, I am really in two minds about this game. I really do admire it in many ways, but ultimately you have to rate a game based on how much fun it is to play, and, while I don't hate AF by any means, most of the time it isn't particularly fun for me and I'd never actively choose to play it any more. Hence I am reducing my rating - previously it was 7, but compared to a lot of the other games which I give that rating to, I think I have to make this one a 6.

Very fun game with a lot of fun decisions to make.  It can get a bit nasty, however, so don't play with someone that gets upset easily.  Also, due to the fact that you really can't plan your turn until you roll the dice and then have to figure out what to do with all of them  at once, downtime between turns can get a bit lengthy at times.

The alien tech cards provide an asymmetry that I like, but some of them are way better than others (resource cache, data crystal). I guess that's what the raiders' ability to steal them is for, but you still have to roll a straight and take an action to do that, and someone starting with the resource cache is getting a pretty big advantage.

An enjoyable dice-rolling game with excellent theme and artwork. 

It's not too heavy to start with, although as the game goes on and people start acquiring more ships (dice), Alien Tech cards and abilities granted by having control of a particular area of the planet, it can get more complicated with a slight risk of AP.

None the less, it's a great game.

Great game! Simple rules, easy to learn and fun to play. Component quality is amazing, I really love the artwork. The game uses a simplistic worker placement mechanic with partial player interaction but the game has depth and -not so easy- decision making. Every game is tight and I have never seen someone get the lead and win easily (probably because the others wouldn't let them). Always willing to get it on the table, even with non gamers.

Bought in perfect condition from FB trade group. Really enjoy the game, though your success is of course reliant on halfway decent dice rolls, especially early in the game.  The worker/dice placement provides interesting choices while trying to place colonies for area control and gather technology to help you.  I look forward to playing with the factions and expansions packs.

RATING: 7.5
Roll your dice (ships), then decide how to best utilize them in placement to accumulate resources and try to colonize the  planet.  But those dice remain on the board so you also have the opportunity to block your opponents.  There is definitely a "take that"/screwage factor in this game.  Besides blocking, there are cards that let you steal your opponents resources, do things such as develop or utilize the cards at a lower cost, and even cards to blast your opponents dice (ships) out of an area or block them from stealing. 

Planning what to do on your turn as play moves around the table is key - but be prepared to adapt as your options might not be available.  The right tactics are key.

Take that elements may turn some away. Also, AP could be an issue, as you don't roll your dice until your turn, so there isn't much ability to plan for your next turn ahead of time. These are not as big an issue with 2, but can be annoying with more players.

OK, so you've introduced your group, a bunch of designer game virgins to Catan. They love it. They're asking to play it over and over again. 
You know you need something new to pull them out of Catan before that's all they'll play. What do you get before your entire group turns into Klaus Teuber's howling swine?
Alien Frontiers, of course! This game plays slightly longer than Catan, with many of the same mechanics, plus with a cool retro spacey vibe.
It has dice, plus you can build more dice! It has areas to colonize and cool little snow-globe-esque future cities! And it even has (sort of) the robber mechanic from Catan. And it does all this without the equivalent of the trading system that makes Brenda from Mississauga ask if anyone wants her sheep every turn!
This might be the perfect game to wean your group off of Catan.
I played this with a total of three players, myself included. It played perfectly with that number, and I'm actually a little bit worried as to how it plays with 4, as the strategy of blocking off important parts of the board with your own dice gets invalidated a bit (then again, that strategy totally failed me; I finished in a close third place.)

Alien Frontiers is just what I thought and hoped it would be - it's what I wanted Kingsberg to be! I do like it, much more than I like Kingsberg. I suspect there are things about it I think could be better, or different, but I will certainly be playing it some more.

I played this with the designer at RinCon10, and not only was the game enjoyable, but Tory was fun to talk to as well. And he's just up the road (about 90 minutes) in Phoenix! I was glad to meet him, and as soon as he gets his copies of the game I will be trading him a copy of Terra Prime for one - and I'm looking forward to that :)

Had been wanting to try this one for a while, but it always seemed to get bumped to the back burner by something else.  I also have kind of an aversion to area-control, mostly due to being traumatized by El Grande.  Fortunately, this combines something I love - dice manipulation with area control to make an interesting game experience.  The theme seems a little pasted-on, but the gameplay is fun and once you know what you're doing, the downtime is minimal.  I can see why this is so highly rated on here.  I also like how the board gets artificially tightened with less than 4 players.  I love tightness.  I don't know if I would like playing it with two, tho.  It's a good game, that isn't overly long and plays quickly.  Despite this, my only knocks on it are that it seems like it goes one round longer than it should and there can be a bit of a kingmaker element to it.  A solid 8.

It's a clever design, without too much extraneous nonsense (although I've mixed feelings about the Faction expansion).  The criticisms about potential AP were right - I tend to make my moves quickly, but some players can take their sweet time.  Gives the other players an opportunity to chat and get beer, but it does drag things a touch.  Surprisingly cut-throat (in a good way) with the Raider's Outpost and the back-and-forth late-game area control. I think the slightly overly-long play time and the abstract nature of the game are the only things keeping me from ranking this higher.

A solid 3-player game to pull out, esp. for those interested in a a space theme.  I'll definitely be hanging on to this one.

The "roll and place" mechanic is a good idea, now copied by other games (maybe this one copied it from some other game, I don't know).

Update: I have had a chance to play this a little bit more and I have a slightly different outlook. I will be honest, I really enjoy dice euros. This game is good in my opinion but suffers from a few things that should be considered. First off, acquiring additional dice while playing the game can make or break your overall playing experience. Another factor that irritated some players that I have played with is the ability to steal resources and cards. This by itself can frustrate players to never play again. Finally, the leader bashing and king making aspect leaves me disappointed. On a positive note, the sci-fi setting as well as the layout/design are very good.

The problem is that this game has various minor irritants that affect certain types of players. When another player is not enjoying themselves and just wishes the game was over with it ruins the experience for me.

In closing, players prone to AP will have significant issues with this game. Players irritated by having resources and cards stolen from them will have issues. As I mentioned, I really enjoy the game as I am fond of dice euros. The problem is that I have yet to find anyone else in my various gaming groups that is really enthusiastic about this one, which is a shame.

This scifi game takes place on a solitary planet where various factions race to colonize the territories named after famous scifi novelists. Great looking board and the upgraded components are nice too. Ships as dice are kind of boring to see, but unavoidable as dice rolling is the main mechanic. Think Puerto Rico in space with a dash of Yahtzee, then imagine it being really good! If there was a bit more 'take that' this game would be an easy 9.

#76 on my Top 100 Games of All Time (2015)

Using dice as workers is something I like and this game does that really well. Players deploy their dice to various sectors on the board to acquire resources/ability cards and colonize. Each sector on the board has its own requirement on what you need to roll to place there. There is quite a bit of player interaction as you fight over colonization and can block other players from certain areas.

Worker-placement game with 'Kingsburg' dice elements. Players are rolling and placing dice to get resources to build more ships (aka dice). Object is to place colonies on a central board. 1VP per colony placed and 1vp for bonus tile (can be taken by majority in space on board). Special tech cards add chaos and options to the mix.

Clips along nicely but players can get effectively hosed if they are subject to the 'take that' raiders element. Not fun to sit through a game you can't win. Balance feels 'off'. The fact that downstream players after the first get extra resources should give indication of balance issues.

Good solid game.

A better game than Kingsburg, Alien Frontiers has better choices and offers a bit more variety. There's also more player conflict and interaction. 

There are some good mechanics and ideas here. I need to play this again.

Dice, Worker Placement, Area Control. I've had my eye on this a long time but didn't want to get it without trying it first. Played it twice at BGGcon and we all really enjoyed it. Good implementation of dice-placement, nice variable powers from the alien tech cards.

Someone in our group needs to get it; wouldn't mind if it was me, heh.

A game I really enjoy. This one has almost totally taken Kingsburg's place at the table. The interaction between the players is far more interesting in Alien Frontiers. I really like the look and feel of the game, and this one works well with three or four players. A good thing indeed. The cards in the game give you even more ways to tinker with your rolls and manipulate your options on the board. This one is highly recommended.

Szeretem a kockajátékokat. Kíváncsi voltam a Kingsubrg és az Alea Iacta Est után mit tud felmutatni az Alien Frontiers. A trónkövetelő sok mindent megtett, de nem változott a király személye. Nem sokon múlt a siker. Kiegyenlített játék, sci-fi téma, a kockák lehelyezésének, fennmaradásának mechanizmusai és az ikonozás nagyon jól sikerült. Az összképen a feliratos kártyák és azok kombinációs lehetőségének kisebb nehézsége csak nagyon kis mértékben ront számomra. Több játék után ez szerintem nem gond. Viszont a konfliktusforrás megjelenése rablásban az nem jött be. Sosem szeretem a rablás lehetőségét a játékokban. Ahogy az Endeavorból így ebből sem hiányzott volna egyáltalán, ha nem kerül bele. Ugyanúgy, mint az említett játékban ebben sem túl veszélyes ez a dolog, de azért több játékos esetén a királycsinálás lehetőségét adja meg. Kellemes, jó kockajáték az Alien Frontiers, amiben lehet kombinálni és jó szórakozást nyújt. Véleményem szerint ketten lehet a legjobb a játékélmény. Nem sokon múlt, de nálam maradt az Alea Iacta Est a kockajátékok királya. Körülbelül nekem egy szinten van a Kingsburggel, de nem hasonlíthatóak össze, teljesen más a két játék.

Great fun. Half point deducted for the "trashy" elements (alien tech, field generators... I hate card reading), but otherwise a solid game. I love how there are only two resources (instead of a gazillion), and one of them is harder to get than the other.

A worker placement game that uses dice as the main resource. I really like the concept BUT I find that whoever can get more dice faster will always do better. Especially since if no one else can roll what they need, then theres not much they can do to catch up. If you want a worker placement with dice game, check out Kingsburg.

Nice worker placement game where you manipulate dice to get the actions that you need to win the game.  It feels like someone played Mission: Red Planet and started this design by trying to figure out what would make M:RP fun; as a joke they said "dice" and then discovered they were right. 

There are a number of great things going on here.  I especially like that you get points for every guy down despite not having control, it keeps the game going forward.  But, I can't help but feel that you just kind of do the same stuff, until one player ends the game with more stuff.  Mid to late game can have more downtime as you get more actions and more abilities to manipulate your dice.

All in all it is a standard worker placement/engine euro. I wouldn't run out to get this, but I'd totally trade a game that I don't like for it.

There is such a thing as a game being TOO balanced, and I think Alien Frontiers is it.  The final few turns just seem too close, regardless of what has happened earlier in the game.  The more I play it, the less impressed I am with it.  Also, the Shipyard mechanic is just way too important in the game; if you roll no pairs for the first four turns, I truly believe you are screwed.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A good solid game.  I heard that the designer created this because this is what he thought Kingsburg would be like.  I like that this came from an idea of what another game would be like.

In our 4-player game, it ended up being a fairly close race at the end, where I was able to pull off victory because a few items went my way, including a good bit of luck early in the game.  Overall a good game, and a good item for times when you want a little strategy and luck with a game group with at least a little experience.

I think there's a lot to take in on a first play. The rules are simple and the game goes by quickly, but nailing down the actions plus the special powers for each region aren't going to happen the first time (for me, anyway). Also, since you pick up your dice at the beginning of your turn, you can't plan that much in advance, slowing the game down (although I'm sure this becomes much quicker/easier with repeated plays). I'll give this one a few more plays but I'm not convinced it is going to work well with my casual group.

"The sky is the limit only for those who aren't afraid to fly!"

I've always been a sucker for dice placement, Alien Frontiers masters the notion of pre-action luck but still gives you tons of way to fine control whatever you want to do, thanks to the plethora of cards that allow you to manipulate dices.
Even though i'm more interested in heavier stuff nowadays, i still enjoy this game.

Surprisingly good worker/dice placement game. I don't see a lot of depth in the decisions, but it works better than most worker placement games by giving players enough turn-to-turn variability while avoiding the missteps of others (e.g. the way Kingsburg penalizes players for unlucky rolls; the take-that quests in Lords of Waterdeep). And it's about as long as it ought to be.

Alien Frontiers is a decent area control worker placement game with some nice mechanisms. It's one of the few area control games that I've really got on well with but isn't one of my favourite games because:

1. There is a fair bit of down-time
2. Sometimes I resent the "take that" from other players. I am a non-conflict player normally so I don't always like this
3. Games tend to feel a bit samey

*Sold as it's gone down my list of priorities for play.

I really like this game and want to play it more often but I just don't like it with 2 people because you have to be mean if you want to win. With 3-4 you can spread the hate around a little bit when taking spots/stealing resources, but with 2 every action needs to benefit you and hurt your opponent.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A dice-based worker-placement/action-selection, area-control game: roll dice, place in allowable areas to use those actions. Pretty good, really; but:
- that one action that allows you to steal 4 resources is VERY annoying; if 2 people have the holographic projector, the other can get hit continually by that power!
- [b]too much downtime[/b]; it would be nicer if you could roll your dice and plan what to do for next turn; of course, that wouldn't work here since some spaces will be occupied. Maybe it would work, if you had another set of dice and kept your roll hidden (you could at least make SOME kind of plan)?
- the game seems to be [b]too long[/b] for what's happening here; if it really finished in 60min, I'd probably like it a little more.

--- Summary ---
The board shows a planet with several regions on it and several orbital stations around it. The stations are the Actions in the game; they give you energy or ore, allow you to build more ships (use more dice), colonize areas of the planet, by alien tech cards, or steal a card OR resources (ore, energy) from other players. Each colony placed = 1 VP. Having control of a planetary region (more colonies than any other single player) gives you +1VP and a special power associated with that region -- almost all of which improve an associated action in some way (e.g., better trade ratio for energy to ore, pay less to colonize, etc.). 

On your turn, roll your available ships (start with 3d6) and allocate amongst the actions as you are able (each has different rules for allowable placements: e.g., pair, triplet, 3-die straight, at least as many pips as highest die already present, etc.). May use previously acquired tech cards (start with 1; may never have duplicates; all are face up and public) as you like, each card once/turn. At end of turn, discard down to 8 total resources.

Game ends when someone places their last colony onto planet; player with most VP wins.

RATING: 7
I like this a lot, there are interesting choices when allocating your dice and lots of special powers to go for.  The only thing I'm not crazy about is the pirate fleet power, or whatever it's called, that can result in big swings and a lot of whack-the-leader.

A captivating early and middle game unfortunately bogs down with the dull, near-obvious endgame.  If the endgame weren't so poor, I think this would be one of my absolute favourites, period.

I like the mix of worker placement, random dice rolls, and area control/dominance.  The different elements feel very balanced and well designed and I like the amount of options you have each turn.  These options plus the random dice rolls offer an interesting and fun mix between strategy and tactics.

Pass that, I feel like the game is themeless and not very deep.  I don't feel like I'm playing a game of interstellar colonization and I certainly don't feel like my dice are ships.  There's an okay amount of variety in the number of action spaces, area powers, and alien tech cards but almost no variability and not enough variety to keep the game from getting dull after enough plays.

A new dice mechanic that unfortunately doesn't work for me. I like the way the game is organized but I think you have to be lucky to play the game. In other words if you're lucky you'll win the game for sure. There's no catch-up mechanism meaning that the player that is ahead stays ahead. First part of the game makes you go for more dice. It's an obvious choice. You need a pair of dice to go for it. Two things can happen here: you have a pair of dice which is great and you nail it. You don't get a pair of dice. Period! There's no way to turn around things unless you can get a special card that gives you permission to modify your results. But that's another way of putting luck working for you - or against you. 
So, since I've rolled the dice about 5 times before getting my first pair, and so did another player. And since the third player got that pair of dice early (not just one but two!) I guess we could all leave the table after those first 3/4 turns. The game was finished by then. I know this now. Unfortunately I didn't know it back then!

Another unfavored point to the game is the lack of real area control. A few stations during the game is what players get and these are supposed to be used to control a few regions in the planet. It simply doesn't work. One because they are only a few specially at the beginning. Two because there are too many regions to have a meaningful dispute specially with three players only.

Alien Frontiers doesn't even have a bit of suspense to the victory because everything that matters is open information.

A few changes in how players could modify the rolls and how to balance gameplay by getting a catch-up mechanism would improve the game IMO.

A worker placement game where dice are your workers, which makes both interesting and more luck-based. I don't like how it makes it harder to plan your next move because you need to know your roll, I do like how the dice block the different locations. So, not my favorite but I had a good time and would play again (though for me, without expansions, especially not with more than 4 players as the expansions allow for more players which makes things drag too much).

I've always felt that offering players too many optimization choices is not great game design, and when you give players the ability to change the pips on dice, you're inviting a level of analysis paralysis that is no longer so much about making tough, dramatic decisions as sorting through a large number of humdrum mathematical options to find the one that happens to work in that moment. Games like Alien Frontiers and Kingsburg suffer this.

Area majority, Dice rolling/WP, Card special powers, some where to place all rubbish rolls.

OK, but nothing new or original mechanics wise. What i do like is the theme (not a castle or guild in sight) and the production quality - the Dice are really cool.

What it is a great example of is how a small publisher can bat with the big boys - and hope that this is the start of a new trend. 

2nd play and I am not liking this game. Its so slow as every one has to rethink their options on their turn depending on the dice roll, plus the interactions with the alien techs. Too much downtime

Plus I won just by ramping my dice up which seems a little too obvious - since been told that there is a tech that kills dice but why would anyone sack a card that has other benefits to take one for the team? Lots of nice ideas but the down time is a killer for me.

A bit disappointed with this one. Game was too long for what it is, and has fair bit of downtime, with limited planning available ahead of your actual turn. It is also very random and quite grief-y. Would probably work better as a 2 player game?

Would probably be willing to try it again, though would want to see if it is enjoyable with 2 I think before trying again at a higher player count.

Another note: The packaging, components, art, mechanisms etc. give the impression this is going to be a less grief-y euro in feel, but to me it doesn't feel like that at all. Zoe and Jud thought it seemed like Stone Age (!). This mismatch of expectations to experience is a negative in my mind.

Beautiful "random-resource" worker placement game with lots of player interaction and cutthroat potential. It can be a tad long for what it is as there is nothing to do outside of your turn. Theme works great and the basics of the game are easy to pick up. Best played with 3. 2 players works well as does 4 but the downtime starts to show up if AP prone. Do not suggest 5 player unless a player timer is used.

My copy has been pimped out with custom ore, fuel, Relic Ship die and the upgrade pack with painted colonies.

This is just a great hodge-podge of various mechanics, but it REALLY works well.  Is it thematic? Nope.  Decent components, but not stellar (see what I did there?).  nods to the SF greats--lovely!  This is currently our go-to dice placement game, and has held up for a couple years now.

The take that is a bit too much for my taste and doesn't fit the worker placement mechanic.
I don't get people saying there's always something to do with your dice as if you never roll pairs or straights there's little you can do but stay behind.

Full of dice but they work well here; there are several ways to manage your luck and a few sinks so even really awful rolls do [i]some[/i] good. There isn't a whole lot of strategy (no engine building, no combos) and it all seems so well-balanced that it doesn't much matter what you do -- and this closeness compounds the luck factor. Throw in the possibilities for AP and downtime and there's just not much there to love.

It's a decent enough light game but there are better dice games these days: this is one I would never choose over Burgundy or Troyes.

The gameplay is more vicious and cutthroat than in other worker placement games thanks to the Raiders Outpost and the Alien Tech cards. Very nice components, I have the 4th ed with the little domed colonies but not the rocket dice. The retro-pulp artwork is fantastic.

Only downside for me, you can't really plan your turn ahead because of the dice mechanic, so there is a noticeable downtime between turns, I don't think I'd like to play with more than 4 players, so the extra player in Factions is really for more nice bits.

Expansions: Factions.

Some theme play.  Fairly easy to learn and play, may take a play or two to grasp strategies.  Not much downtime and little player interaction.  Cards can be unbalancing - don't ignore them!  Awful end game - massive kingmaker problems.  Components are excellent - mounted board with drab artwork, plastic dice and playing pieces, thick cardboard tokens & durable linen cards.  Artwork on cards is fair at best.  Game length is about 2 hours and seems to drag.

I was really looking forward to trying this game, given the reviews and commentary I've seen. So I was disappointed to finally play it and realize it was "okay". Perhaps my opinion would improve with additional plays, but luck seemed to dominate strategy and there were turns for all the players where, while you could always do SOMETHING, it wasn't anything that actually helped your position in the game.

Dużo fajnego kombinowania i możliwość ostrej rywalizacji. Worker placement z kostkami zamiast typowych "ludzików" + area control. Początkowo sądziłem, że to moja ulubiona gra planszowa, niestety po 20 rozgrywkach mój entuzjazm osłabł - z czasem stała się schematyczna a do tego uświadomiłem sobie, że mimo starań projektanta jest zupełnie pozbawiona klimatu.

[Clever Mojo Games 2010 edition] {Space; dice-rolling, worker-placement, area-control; scalable} Alien Frontier is a meaty game with dice.  Player races to build colonies at different territories.  It's fun and interactive.  A typical game runs around 60 minutes.  Yet, it is not as thematic as I expected.  Decisions are meaningful in Alien Frontier - players have to smartly place their 'fleet' to correct location to build up the engine, players have to decision which territory to control and which power to use, etc.  Competition of territory control and space ports is tense - it usually happens that you cannot get what you want because the docks are occupied by previous players.

The rulebook is very clear.  It is very simple to learn and teach.  The game components are as good as games from big publishers.

It is a very good game.  I am so glad that I own this game at the first print run.  And, I expect to see it being more popular in future when it is more accessible.

Even though the space theme is very intriguing, I think that KINGSBURG is just a tad bit more interesting and has a higher replay value, especially with the expansion, for two reasons: a) More variability with the different buildings; b) the uncertainty of the hordes at the end of each game year.

As noted elsewhere, there is some downtime between turns as players consider their many options. The final turn can be subject to some serious AP.

Nice artwork & theme; OK game. It's essentially a race to place your markers, with an occasional detour to reduce the VP of the leader.

Our first play left me a little underwhelmed.  It seems a bit too easy with no real decisions to be made.  Also, it felt like it was going to take way longer than it did which turned me off from the get-go.

I rate it a 6.5 after one play, but I don't have high hopes for this game.  I'd rather play Ra: The Dice Game almost every single time.  It's just a better game, no question about it.

RATING: 8
Very good space colonization game where the dice you use represent your ships. There are a number of options available to you, such as obtaining resources or technology, build new ships (gain extra dice thereby increasing your options), colonize the planet etc. Many of the options seem obvious at first as they all have conditions attached to them and the dice you assign to them have to meet those conditions. However, as the game progresses and you obtain more dice and more modifiers, the decisions you face and strategies you can adopt increase quite considerably. The gameplay also marries very well with the theme in 'Alien Frontiers', which can often be a failing in this type of game where the theme can sometimes feel like something of an afterthought.

Excellent game of dice rolling, worker placement, and area control.

Good light euro-game. Has a very nice cadans in game flow. What it does best is allowing you to enjoy yourself in a very easy going fashion. No really harsh decisions, no nailbiting tension but certainly no boredom and downtime either. Really nice game to play which will attract a great diversity of people.

For hardcore gamers this game will be on the light side, though. 

Only drawback we had is the really high-powered raiding action coupled with the Decoy, which in a 3 player game almost shut out a third player with decidedly less ships, who got raided almost every turn by his (inexperienced) neighbour. But this might be start-up problems. 

Still we feel the raiding action is a bit too powerful. We will tone it down to three resources of choice raided and get rid of both Decoy cards in the tech deck. This hopefully improves the game even more.

But all in all, nice components, good gameflow, not too heavy and enjoyable all around. Good, solid game.

I like the dice rolling mechanics, some of the other concepts here seem to mar the finished product. THe area control system seems tacked on w/ no relation to the dice rolling aspect. More importantly, the area control is rather simple and encourages leader bashing. So while the tactics of how to play your die roll are fun, and mildly interesting, the overall strategy seems rather simple and prone to being determined by fate (or king making) which is too bad as it mars a clever little system. A little long for what it is, but not bad; not very deep somewhat luck dependent. Worth checking out for the mechanics. I would rate it higher for creativity/mechanics, my given rating reflects the urge to play.

Game play is reasonably good and Ive enjoyed playing it so far. Gameplay essentially boils down to solving a dice optimisation puzzle each turn. Its a tactical game with little long term strategy. I want to play it again at the moment so it must be better than I am making it sound! (17/5/11)

Quite nice, plays along nicely, but did outstay its welcome a bit. And the spot that lets you waste a ship for a colony shouldn't be blocked a whole round. It lets the player who used it, be the only one to use it again the round after (if he rolls a six again), which really limits the other player's options in the last rounds.

The group of 4 I played this with (all first timers) really enjoyed Alien Frontiers.  It didn't quite have the simplistic feel that Stone Age has due there being so much more going on, but I don't think that's a pro or a con...just a different feel.

Update 9/18/2011: Played another game of this with three players.  the chaotic feel of this game is still there.  I really want to rate this higher, and I do like the game, but It's gotta stay where it's at (7.5).

Interesting game although I'm currently unsure of what exactly I think about it.

I like it for the most part, but only have a couple of plays with three players.  The card interactions seem to be what the focus is on, though it has yet to come to fruition in our plays of the game.

I missed a rule with the spaceship which made the first two plays of the game suspect and made the colonies at the bottom, and the fast colony builder at the six on clock position less used.  I'm dying to play it more.

interesting game with some very nice aspects
+ space theme with area control on a moon
+ nice twist of the dice worker placement mechanic
+ good materials
- seems a bit race-like because game ends when first player used up his colonies
- wants the factions from its first expansions for asymmetric player powers


I hate that the whole Kickstarter financing and distribution makes it quite unattainable and expensive. My impression is that they do it just to keep the prices high by selling one Deluxe Edition after the other while not caring about normal customers.

Also, rocket dice and the 6-fold board in the newer versions seem like a bad idea.

2015/4/25: Played it again a few years alter and this time it really clicked. The design holds up nicely and clearly surpasses the hype of a few years ago. The fact that you have lots of option and you never feel like you can't do anything with your dice really helps.

2011/6/10: Certainly one of the most polished games of the recent wave of "Dice-Games". It's easy to learn; frustration factor is low, since you can do somthing with any dice-roll and the artwork is gorgeous. OTOH, Alien Frontiers feels a bit overproduced and, for my taste, it takes a bit too long for a game of it's kind. All that said and given the hype this game has received on BGG, I feel kind of underwhelmed. Certainly a nice game and I'd play again anytime - but I don't need to own it.

Can be a very aggressive game which is why I love it.

Once you know the base game factions is worth adding.

Alien Frontiers is a nice little dice placement game.  Unlike Kingsburg, which it is oft compared to, I feel that rolling low numbers will not hurt you here, which levels out the game. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Alien Frontiers can be an enjoyable mid-weight worker placement game that uses dice instead of static pieces. Each turn you roll your "ships" (dice) and then place them at various stations around the board. The goal is to gather resources and build colonies on the mysterious planet in the center of the board. The game has beautiful graphic design and is well put together mechanically. The space theme is a bonus for me.

But all of these things cannot, unfortunately, overcome my two major criticisms.

First, the game encourages players to pick on the leader. Scoring is constantly updated to reflect your current status. So if someone attacks your territory, you lose points while the attacker gains points. The Raider's Outpost also allows others to steal your resources and Alien Tech (special ability) cards. While there are ways to mitigate the damage, there is almost always a way for the group to bring down the leader. The effect is amplified by the fact that, in most games, you are only fighting over 6-10 points total. The result of all this attacking is that your choices matter less. You cannot gain a meaningful lead, and so it is more important to ride the wave of group-think than to play well on your own merits. In a game of diplomacy or negotiation, I wouldn't mind the jockeying, but in a game that ostensibly emphasizes resource manipulation, the politics seems out of place.

Second, downtime is an issue. And downtime, for me, is the kiss of death. The player in Alien Frontiers is presented with a wealth of options each turn. For people who play slowly and want to work through each set of options before taking action, turns can drag on and on. In one recent game, I was able to play almost an entire game of Backgammon on the side while waiting for the turn to come back around to me. And what do the over-analyzing players gain from all this computation? Not much, unfortunately, because as soon as they gain a lead, a couple swift kicks later they are back in the pack.

As a two-player game, where actions are zero sum and downtime is minimized, or with a light-hearted group of fast-playing people, Alien Frontiers is still enjoyable. But as a game I want to play often, it simply doesn't measure up.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.05
The long downtime slightly hurts the game, but the many ways to do stuff means you won't be dependant on luck for long. Pair it with an awesome theme, a fun game with dice, and you have yourself a winner.

I love it how at the latter stages of the game, the question isn't CAN I put down a settlement this turn? It's HOW do I put down a settlement this turn? With 6-7 ships and a handful of Alien Artifacts, there's almost always a way. The question then becomes, can I put down TWO settlements this turn?

One of the better dice games, right up there with Kingsburg, Alea Iacta Est and so on. It's a good combination of dice rolling + resource management, but maybe just a tad bit too long and gets a bit over-complicated towards the end - still quite good if you want a dice game with scope and meaning.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.5
It's like the inverse of Stone Age.  Stone Age you place your men, and where you place the dice determine how you roll the dice / resources you get.  This one you roll the dice first, and then allocate them to get the resources you need.  

Very enjoyable.  I like!

Subsequent plays, I find its too random, even for a dice game....  Since it's so easy to steal stuff, there is too little "building" between turns.   Downgraded rating... 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
After one game I like it a lot.
The use of dice is very good here. A lot ways of confrontation. Many different ways to victory.
All in all a clean set of rather simple rules but a lot of gameplay.

Want to play again soon.

Played once.

Probably the best dice worker placement game I have played. It plays well even with two players (unlike say Euphoria, where the game really loses something without at least 3), and can be played in a rather reasonable amount of time. Excited to try both expansions for the game.

RATING: 9
Superb. Looks like they'll be a lot of life to this one. Kingsburg grows up with a bit of screwage and some nice innovations. Particularly like the snapshot scoring track rather than traditional accumulated VP's - means in theory that anything can change, but how true this is I'm unsure at this stage. But in our game the lead did change a number fo times. Far better than KB if you prefer the tension of player effect rather than multi-player solitaire.
Very promising - need more plays!

RATING: 6
Just OK. Too much downtime, since the dice prevent you planning your turn. Not enough fun parts to overcome this, and quite a lot of bash-the-leader chaos.

KINGSBURG ... IN ... SPACE (dramatic flourish here)! Before I start listing some quibbles, let me say straight up that I enjoy Alien Frontiers. I get the kind of kick out of this that I felt palpably lacking in Ad Astra, despite the similar themes. Now, that said, this isn't perfect. As with Kingsburg, there are ways to mitigate bad rolls to some extent, but just as with Kingsburg, if you continually roll low numbers you're likely to struggle here. Alien Frontiers also punishes folks something fierce if they're unable to roll doubles (or triples) - yes, you can eventually buy alien tech cards that let you manipulate the dice to make doubles, but by then if you haven't rolled natural doubles to get more ships (dice) early, you're in a deep hole. Alien Frontiers also has enough opportunities for screwage that kingmaking is a possible issue that I'll be keeping an eye on. But again, quibbles. Alien Frontiers is a light dice-rolling romp that doesn't need to be perfect to be fun. Update: Kingmaking and end-game weirdness continue to be an issue here, bringing this down in my ratings. I still enjoy the mechanics, but the end game is all about who you're going to take points away from and who benefits from that. Disappointing to the point where I'm likely to trade this.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Like Kingsburg, rolled dice are then placed on the board to occupy positions and prevent other players from using those spots. Seems a bit more balanced than Kingsburg, though, in that rolling low numbers doesn't disadvantage you as much.

This is a solid dice rolling game with great artwork, very functional components and fun game play. Seems like there are lots of options on one's turn. Too much down time when somebody is considering the Tech Cards on display and how to modify and/or separate the dice. Two player is a race to the first person who can get the extra ships as that person gets a distinct advantage and can continue to block out the shipyard for an extended period of time until it is too late for the other player, who can be crippled by poor dice rolls from three dice.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
The description as a "gamer's Kingsburg" is valid.  In fact, Alien Frontiers may be the most intelligent game based on dice placement.  There's none of the feeling that one is stuck on rails like other similar titles.  But, the reliance on alien tech cards to add spice also creates some mayhem.  It's a little long but very satisfying.

RATING: 6.5
Worker placement with tons of interaction. Definitely want more plays.

Fun, light worker placement game.  Using dice as workers to be placed is an inspired choice as luck mitigates the importance of turn order.  The game can flirt with wearing out its welcome because AP can turn its ugly head.

I don't really think the expansions make the game appreciably better.

Left a very good impression. Fast-moving pace in the game. The artwork is a great tribute to Perry Rhodan (I think). It's as if it was actually created for that universe. We didn't get to finish the game but I'm eager to play it again.Potentially my most favorite dice-based worker placement game.

RATING: 7
I've had one 4-player game so far, pleasantly surprised as to how accessible it was. I enjoyed it quite a bit and I'd like to play it again.

I'll probably change my rating once I've played some more.

I can easily see how you are at the mercy of the dice, though. For instance, the winner of the first game I played rolled no less than 3 three-of-a-kind allowing her to place one colony per turn. It was her first game too.

While I am not saying that this detracts from the fun to be had, it is still notewhorthy.

RATING: 8
Roll your dice, assigning various numeric combinations to different action locations on the board to collect and utilize resources, all in an effort to colonize the planet better than the other players. Special cards (alien tech) and colonial abilities provide variety and player differentiation, while the dice rolls require adaptability.

RATING: 4
Just really didn't care for the game. Maybe it was overhyped. Even though it can be mitigated to some extent, the randomness of the dice rolls play a big part in determining the winner. You can have the perfect winning move planned out, but if the dice don't turn up, you lose. That's not too bad in some lighter games, but this is an average-length euro.

I think this is a step up from Euphoria which I also like. Games can end fast and could be somewhat anti-climatic. But being light-medium weighted this is expected. A lot of admirable design decisions (e.g. plenty of repeated tech to step away from ameritrash). From just one play so far, everything feels just right.

This is a game that is a little less fun each time I play. It's very difficult to plan, as you really don't know what will be available to you on your turn, as, in addition to the randomness of your dice roll, you don't know what spaces will be open. This leads to long thinky turns. On top of that, this game is just chaotic. Nothing you do is permanent. Most gains are easily taken by someone else, which makes it even harder to plan future turns. And if I'm just going to lose everything I get within a couple turns, why bother?

The game is elegant and well balanced and the way the dice are integrated is quite clever. I am still impressed at the design and often use this game as an example for the interesting things that can be done with dice without having them dominate gameplay.

I actually like this game more than my rating may indicate.  It has some very good ideas but there are some flaws for sure.

You definitely want to get more dice, which forces you into that 'strategy'.
Downtime between turns can be significant.

How has this game flew under the radar for so long? Speaking to the publisher at GenCon, it sounded like it had been out of print for some time, that may explain it.

Worker placement with a strong theme. Scoring victory points brings you closer to ending the game as well as acquires special powers for your player. 

You gather your action cubes at the beginning of your turn, but your opponent's remain on the board, allowing you to strategically block others.

I'm excited to get more platys of this bay boy in.

First Impression:
An area control dicey euro with a working retro sci-fi theme.

What I liked: 
a) The theme is fine, and the retro graphics, namings as well as the clever cards all create a fine setting for the game. 
b) The components are also fine, and I really liked the little colony tokens. 
c) Contrary to early and late parts of the game, the mid game is sufficiently strategic, as by then most players have enough dice + cards to at least have some choices and they're not yet forced to bash the leader.

What I didn't like: 
a) The whole area control aspect in medium strategy games falls completely flat for me. That's a personal preference, as when there is area control in a game, I want it to be bloody and with negotiation. Or with some hidden information. Otherwise there is just too much kingmaking and bash the leader for my liking. 
b) The "steal" action makes the bashing-the-leader aspect even worse. 
c) The implementation of the dice is just plain bad. The classic high rolls beat low rolls applies here as well (with the exception of the trader which is not enough to counter this), and in addition there are many lucky rolls all around. It doesn't feel tactical at all, and you can hardly ever pick where you want to go, your dice usually lead you - especially when you have just a few of them.
d) The start up of the game is also ridiculsly random, as there are cards you want at the start of the game, cards for the mid game, and cards for the late game. This combined with the dice randomness leads to a completely random first third of the game, where some players will take the lead just because they had a better start and rolled better, and some will fall behind. 
e) The last part of the game is even worse though, and it reminds me a lot of Cyclades. Since one has to place 6 colonies to end the game, but not necesserily win it, once a player has put down 5 colonies he's bashed in any possible way from everyone else because he MAY win. Thus, the rest soon catch up, and the game ends up with most players close to winning, all bashing the next one ready to, until one succeeds. The 2h you played before that, with all it's randomness and strategy matters for nothing at the end. If you were lucky and good, the others will simply beat you down until they catch up. 
f) Finally and most importantly, the game really suffers from downtime, as there is absolutely nothing you can do, or even plan at the turn of any other player, and the dice rolling, and card searching, and special abilities reading only makes this worse.

This game uses a couple of mechanisms I really dislike (dice rolling and area control in a euro game), and adds downtime, randomness, bashing-the-leader encouragment and a terrible endgame. I can't see myself playing this ever again on my own, but I'll try to if someone insists just to give it a second chance.

I can certainly see how this game is not going to be for everyone and I can see where the idea of replay is slim as just a base game goes but I like it.

Similar to Alea Iacta Est, in that each player rolls a personal set of dice and places them on competitive areas of the board to build an engine, get special powers, and work toward victory conditions. Great components and very well presented. My rating may rise with subsequent plays, but this one did not really grab me like I had hoped.

RATING: 9
Excellent game. Very nice components and theme. This is a fresh dice game with a lot of different ways to build your "engine" and achieve victory. If you like Kingsburg, Alien Frontiers is the game that Kingsburg should had been. I love the nice touch where the different territories are named after famous sci-fi writers. It plays fast, and there is always tension until your turn comes up again. It does not get a rating of 10 because, there are some issues of king-making. Although the game feels like a game where you build up your resources and special abilities, it is actually a race game of how will achieve victory faster. Although there are dice, there is a lot of strategy no matter what you roll (opposite to Kingsburg where if you roll low you cannot win). the game plays best when you need 8 colonies to win, but the 6 colonies works extremely well to teach the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Placing all dice at once (instead of taking turns placing some dice as in Kingsburg) produces downtime and prevents you from planning your moves ahead.  You cannot decide what you will do on your turn until you roll the dice on your turn, so it is boring when it is not your turn.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Love the theme and mechanics of this game. Game came with tuckboxes, which instantly made it awesome. The idea of using dice as your workers - something also seen in Marco Polo - is interesting and adds an unknown factor to the game. I've seen people get put off by the dice, but I like it. 

Only complaint is I personally didn't like the colours of the dice. They looked a bit flushed. Replaced the dice with some of my own.

RATING: 7
The goal of the game is to get the most point, which is done by sending your colony ships to the moon (or possibly some other planet... I didn't really figure that part out). You get 1 point for every colony you send, and 1 point for every territory you control. Only there's an area control contest going on because there aren't enough territories on the moon, and all of them come with cool abilities.

On your turn you roll you dice and then place them on the board. Various actions have placement restrictions of needing high numbers, sequences, pairs, low numbers etc. Additionally, you only take your dice back at the start of your next turn. In the interim they stay out and block other players. There are cards you can purchase in the game, which let you do cool dice manipulation things, and a few other special powers.

Most of the actions in the game revolve around getting energy and ore, the game's two currencies, and getting more dice, or ways to get card, or launching colony ships.

The game ends whenever any player gets his last colony launched... which generally, but not always, will mean that player wins.

The game was interesting. There's some strategy going on. It's not a game I'd want to play all the time, but it was fun.

But I've yet to lose, and that's actually a problem, as I can see their enthusiasm for this game fall...

RATING: 3
In any game, I think it's infuriating to have to listen to other people talk through special power combos as they execute them: experience suggests to me that people (including me) cannot help but sound smug doing so. Something like Dominion can succeed in spite of this because you only ever have to be half-listening to your opponent: you can dedicate a good portion of your attention to planning your own turn instead. In Alien Frontiers, you can't really do so: because you don't know what your dice will let you do until the start of your turn, there's no meaningful planning to hide behind, and therefore you'll find yourself with nothing to do but listen to each and every bit of your opponent's self-satisfied monologue. The problem is that the natural reaction to this is to try and sound even more self-satisfied on your own turn by way of revenge.

This might sound like a group-dependent complaint. I don't believe it is.

Thematically excellent. Lots of fun to play, with a tight race to victory. Possibly a bit too much downtime, especially near the end as you wait for others to decide what to do, making it a trifle too long for what it is. But the enjoyment factor is otherwise high. I look forward to playing it again.

Not sure why I like this game so much. It has got all the elements I dislike about games: AP potential, kingmaking, lots of downtime near the end of the game and a longish playing time when played with more than two. Must be the interesting combos you can make with dice and cards. Or the looks. Or the dice throwing. Or the interactivity. Or maybe the thrilling endgame. Both our girlfriends liked it better than Agricola. Not sure why. I like Kingsburg a little bit better, even though AF offers more player interaction (in case you wondered).
UPDATE: Like it more with every play. The endgame can still bog down due to the interesting discard powers of the cards. Personally, I don't mind that. The game is even better (less balanced) with the Faction expansion.

Some nice ideas but overly long. Also some aspects of the game just didn't fit to my taste. I don't like the stealing aspect too much for example. Also, I'm quite worried about some aspects of the game - I think design-wise it was bad idea to limit the dices that can be placed in the action space that lets you place influence disks on the planet. In the game it feels that every turn was evolving around that action: can I get three grey cubes and take the action that allows me place the influence disks or not. If I could do it, my turn was over in few minutes, but if it was impossible the turn would take much longer...

The Dice management game  I liked the less between all this type of game i've played (Yspahan, Stone Age, Kingsburg, Livingstone...).
Way to long between turns.
The one that take the lead by taking his dice in first turns is in buisness to win.
If you are behind, you will stay behind cause there is no way to come back.
Only one realy bowring game. Give it a try before buying it.

Um dice placement clássico. Tão clássico que falta um pouco de frescor de novidade. Parece apenas algo que já vi diversas vezes em outros jogos de dados, como Roll for the Galaxy e Quantum, entre outros. Não que não tenha gostado, talvez tivesse amado se tivesse conhecido no início do hobby, porém conhecendo hoje, tenha pesado a falta de algo mais moderno e/ou diferente.

Although it wasn't the first game to use dice as workers (nor the last!), Alien Frontiers is still an excpetional game. My first playthrough felt fun but flat. However, additional play throughout have shown me the power and variety in the alien tech cards. There are also multiple paths to victory. The numerous expansions provide quite a bit of diversity.

Playing this with AP players can be miserable. I played a 3 player game that took 2.5 hours! The worst part about this is that there is nothing to do when it's not your turn, since you have to roll the dice before you can even start thinking about what you are going to do. If you are playing with fast players, then this game is decently fun (I would give it a rating of 6), but there is still little long term strategy.

RATING: 9
A total blast to play. Built on euro mechanics, but interactive to the point of being cutthroat. I will never turn down a chance to play this game. One of my absolute favorites.

It has solid resource management and dice placement mechanics, but also an extremely high level of interactivity. Not only the blocking typical of worker placement games, but stealing resources and cards, zapping your opponent's ships, cutting off their control of a region, and more.

You're rolling dice, and though there's no inbuilt chance mitigation system like the tools in Stone Age or the workers in Castles of Burgundy, you rarely feel screwed by the dice. Higher rolls can be used to block off the lunar mine, but low rolls can be used to get a better trading ratio at the orbital market. No matter what you roll, you can still use dice of any value to advance your colonies toward completion.

The retro-future theme really shines with excellent art, graphic design, and components. The factions expansion adds variable player powers, hidden agendas, and even more interactivity.

The game has a lot of depth and interactivity, but the basic premise is so simple (about the same complexity level as Stone Age or Lords of Waterdeep) that it's very easy to teach and learn.

Really I find very little to dislike about the game. It looks great, plays great, has enough depth and interaction to be replayed constantly but is simple enough to have wide appeal.

Edit: Upon subsequent plays, I've knocked this down from a ten. Kingmaking and leader screwage are the price of interactivity. I also can't think of a game of equivalent weight that has as much downtime. I'll be re-writing the above for a more balanced view.

Some good ideas, but pretty roughly and way too many annoying small details. Strategic seems way too simple. Just first collect dices, then couple of tech cards and then put counters to board. Game has horrible downtime problems and you can't even think your turn beforehand, because everything depends about dices. And game lasts definetely too long. Didn't like at all and was happy, when it eventually end. After all negatives, I have to say, that production values are excellent. Very good looking game.

Interesting worker-placement concept based on dice rolls. Has a satisfyingly large amount of 'stuff', but that also makes it hard to transport. Main shortcoming is it's strictly turn-based and there's nothing to do while you're waiting for turns. Also, hugely sensitive to player order.

RATING: 8.5
Worker-placement game with a retro science fiction theme that uses dice as the "workers" (thematically, the dice are "ships"). There is also an area majority element provided by colony placement in territories. Special powers are obtained for controlling territories and owning "alien artifact" cards (powers include more efficient actions, dice manipulation and colony movements). 

At its core, the game centers on an engine for conversion of assets (energy, minerals, ships, colonies and alien artifact cards) into points, the goal being to end the game with the highest score - scoring is simple: one point for each placed colony plus one point for each controlled territory with the possibility of three additional bonus points obtainable from cards (two single victory point cards and cards that allow placement of a "positronic field" in a territory, giving a bonus point to the controlling player). Game ends immediately when a player plays his last colony - meaning that as scoring is open, the player ending the game is generally the winner (unless, unfortunately, a kingmaker is in the mix).

Game play flows smoothly and is fairly intuitive. There's a clever mechanism wherein placed dice are maintained in their spot until the player's next turn, causing action spaces to be continuously blocked. The game also has a significant level of interactivity as one must keep track of his relative score and can raid other player's resources and reposition colonies to improve his position. All of this result in a tense and tight game where the leader is often continuously changing. The bottom line is that Alien Frontiers is just plain fun. Best for 4 players in my opinion.

As an added bonus, components and retro sci-fi art are superb.

Great dice as workers game where your options depend on your rolls for the round but early game activities can be used to limit the effect of randomness in your planning process.

RATING: 4
30 Minutes of fun. 85 minutes of pure boredom. And wrap it all up with a final 5 minutes that presents an absurd level of potential kingmaking.

There is way to much downtime between turns and nothing to think about when it isn't your turn (you don't know what dice you'll roll.) The idea of the game is awesome, the actual experience: bleh. The game also lacks an arc. You roll dice, get stuff, place stuff and wait and wait and wait until it is your turn to do it again. It never builds, never grows into different types of decisions. If the game took thirty minutes I think I'd like it, but the last 20 minutes felt the same as the first twenty with a whole lot of tedious waiting filling in the middle.

Originally started playing this game on iOS. This might be one of the best iOS board games that I have with maybe only Stone Age or Carcassone being better. It's a pretty basic worker placement game that is way more difficult to learn than it is the play.

Having to explain the what each location allows you to do and the special powers of each location once you have the majority is a pain to new players. Games like this are a bit annoying because they really are super simple and quick to play once you understand everything (like 7 Wonders). However, I've played so much now that I can really give a good rating on how much I like this game. Although simple to play, there are many different paths to victory. Whether you go for cards or for more dice or for lessening resources,  you really can win any way. Can be a bit nasty as you can target certain players when stealing or placing communities, but this is mainly used to combat Kingbuilding. 

TL;DR - A much easier to play than teach worker placement game with a Sci-fi (fairly transparent) theme. One of the favorites in my collection.

Two 3p plays, both came to a close result.  I like many things about this game, but I can't love the package as a whole because of the "interaction" offered by the Raiders' Outpost.  I understand that many people will consider this the best element of the design, but I don't enjoy stealing other people's hard-earned resources, and I for sure hate it when people steal mine. Without it, however, it does seem that rolling high/doubles in the early turns could guarantee a win.

This game really hits it right with me.  Not too complex, but lots of tactical moves and combo's you can pull.  Little randomness with fun dice rolls, plays in under 2 hours.  Mix of worker placement and area control, and I love the frantic race at the end to dump colonies.  Tons of expansion content to keep it fresh, and I have it all.

This was one of the first games that I fell in love with after Settlers and Carcasonne.

While this was my first perfect 10, it's starting to show it's age as my tastes mature, it's still a game I'd  happily play.

The game continues to slide down my ratings, still love my worker placement, but some games can be better than others.  Recently played a game where someone just cycled ships constantly on the planet, there was little time to build up fun alien tech cards and it just felt dull.

great mechanics, great theme.  the board takes a few minutes to digest, but it makes sense soon enough.

update: Folks usually gang up on the leader (and why wouldn't they), and it can drag the game out.  In quicker games I don't mind that, or when it seems to be by design, but here it feels like an unintended dynamic. Don't love that part.

This is supposed to be a good light game, but it takes a significant time to play if you have new players.  Once you have played a time or two, then decisions are a whole lot quicker.  A new player has to think through each option thoroughly in his head and read them all each turn, and this makes it fairly long.  I think Puerto Rico was similar, but it is even more pronounced in this game.

As such, it kind of kills it for an intro game.  It will still be worthwhile if you play in a small gaming group that is willing to play light games repeatedly.

RATING: 6
Excellent game.  The theme and gameplay mesh beautifully in such a way that you hardly ever think about the mechanics in terms of abstract game movement.  Although I am not a huge fan of dice, I love the use of dice in this game.  Instead of being good or bad, the options around the board give whatever you roll a viable strategy.  Would rate higher, but the mechanics make planning almost impossible, so there is a correspondingly high rate of AP.  Pair this with the fact that the lack of planning makes for noticeable down time, and the game feels like it drags at points.  I still rate this an 8.5, so those issues are not necessarily all that bad.  Or, it could be that this game is so much fun, I don't mind the drawbacks.

*Edit - I have changed my rating of this game.  After many, many plays, I have decided that the game loses a bit of its luster after the first couple dozen plays.  Although I still believe that this is a very good game (and an excellent introduction into this style of game), the general same-ness and the downtime have gotten to me.  Perhaps it is a growing collection of very high quality games that has poisoned the well for me (Dominant Species, Dungeon Lords, 7 Wonders, Troyes, etc..), but this is no longer a game that I look forward to playing, when there are so many more dynamic and exciting options available.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The only thing bringing this game down is the large amount of down time between your turns. It's impossible to plan ahead since you don't know what your rolls are, and all the modifications with the Artifact cards can lead to AP. Outside of that it's a fantastic game with many strategies to pursue.

As a lover of dice, I love this game. The game gives you a little bit of yahtzee while diving in deep enough to not feel heavy, but also not feeling like it's only about dice-luck.
The result is something really fun that allows for a light kind of player interaction with dealing heavy blows to your opponents but leaving out player elimination.

Not enthused.  I am really tired of worker placement games.  There are so many, it makes me yearn for a good old auction game, the last mechanic I noticed that was overused so heavily.  The dice are a nice touch, but lead to an annoying amount of analysis paralysis.  Exaggerating the problem is the fact that it seems like the best strategy is to get as many dice as possible as soon as possible.  And then you get more choices on every turn, which slows down the turn even more.

Just not seeing why everyone likes this, especially when compared to other dice games. It's *way* too long, the game has no preset length, and you can literally do nothing but sit there until your turn arrives before you can even roll your dice and start planning something. 

It's just bash the leader over and over again until someone manages to slip through and win, either because someone doesn't get the dice roll to block the win, or just gives up and decides to hand the win to someone, such as happened in our last game.

Ultimately, it's just a race to spam those colonies as fast as you can, and hopefully the dice and metagame will let you do that.

i own about a hundred board games, and Alien Frontiers is my favourite one of the bunch. i love the retro future art, the little domed colonies, and the unbridled ADVENTURE that the whole theme evokes. i love that the game switches halfway through from worker placement to territory control. i love all the fiddly manipulation the alien tech cards allow you to perform. 

i do NOT love how slow their second Kickstarter was, nor am i a fan of GameSalute and their obvious drive to produce a Big Box version while grinding their current fans under their wheels. It annoyed me tremendously that they announced a new Kickstarter campaign before they had even begun to fulfill the first one. i paid a bunch of extra money for ship-shaped dice that don't roll very well and weren't a good upgrade to the game. Love the game, dislike the company. The Kickstarter experience left a bad taste in my mouth, and i play Alien Frontiers almost begrudgingly now.

Commented after one game, which took 2 hours with almost newbie group. With four players that is too much, especially when there is quite a lot of downtime. You can plan your next turn, but if the dice do not co-operate or the previous player blocks the needed locations, you need to start planning again. This could be better with two or three. Not enough to do for such a long game anyway.

Dice game set in space, but the theme is quite thin. Lots of randomness (because the dice have a big role) and blocking others. It's mechanics are quite like Alea Iacta Est, if you are familiar with that game. A small reminder to Alhambra considering the downtime, because the previous player changes the board. :)

I'm not saying this game is bad, but it needs to played faster and may be with fewer players to be enjoyable.

Due to the bash the leader element, the same strategy will never win this game twice in a row. For me, this makes the game BETTER, as you need to adapt your tactics to suit the current situation.

The people who say this game get repetitive are simply not creative enough to see their mistakes or not playing with people of skill.

The end game is always exciting as you must put yourself in a position for a home run move while at the same time manipulating the board to ensure you cannot lose if someone else ends the game.

One 3p play and... its great! I love assigning dice, that's one of my favorite mechanics in a game, but I hate when the dice assigning doesn't feel like... dice. 

In this game, it lifts a few parts of yahtzee and blends in worker placement to make a very satisfying game. You want to roll high (Mostly) and you want duplicates or straights. Then it's just about how to assign those, with enough options at any one time that you don't feel like there's one obvious choice for every dice roll and you're torn in multiple directions. I felt like I had 2-3 avenues to go down in my play of this game, and each one seemed equally tempting and viable. That's a mark of a great, engaging game. 

I expect this to go to a 9 or maybe even 10 with more plays and/or trying the expansions.

You have to give the game credit just for capitalizing on the recent fad of "dice management" games by marrying it to one of the most revered and underused themes: space! Regardless of the actual game play it was destined to be a hit. 

For me in the end the decisions just weren't nearly interesting or varied enough. To quote my geekbuddy Ben (chally): Good rolls lead to certain default decisions; bad rolls lead to different default decisions. I felt like I was along for the ride rather than steering the ship.

I guess I get the whole "Kingsburg in Space" comparisons, but really, this is a game that's separate enough from Kingsburg to be considered in its own light.  For one, the blocking element of Alien Frontiers gives it its own character; for another, the timing and flow of the game is very different.  Yes, it uses dice, and yes, you can place them at different places on the board based on what you roll, but the similarities end there.  Why dilute the effectiveness of a game by comparing it to something completely different?

Do you have what it takes to be a deep space colonist? An alien frontier awaits the brave and daring! This new planet will be harsh, but if you have the skills to manage your resources, build a fleet, research alien life, and settle colonies, the world can be yours.

Roll and place your dice to gain advantages over your opponent and block them out of useful areas of the board. Use Alien Tech cards to manipulate your dice rolls and territory bonuses to break the rules. Steal resources, overtake territories, and do whatever it takes to get your colonies on the map first! Don't dream it'll be easy, though, because the other players will be trying to do the same thing.

I think Kingsburg was the first game to bring dice into a worker placement game, but Alien Frontiers was the first to give this concept some teeth. Dice are your workers and every turn you roll them, to determine what their capabilities will be. Unlike Kingsburg, the choices here are not always obvious and more importantly, taking a space does not mean you have blocked it. Better rolls can knock you out, which adds a nice bit of push your luck to the formula. Obviously, there are means to mitigate and manipulate dice rolls, so as a strategy game Alien Frontiers works in much more interesting way than Kingsburg, right out of the box.

Dice filled Euros are all the rage right now, so this game seems a little less special than it used to be. Still, it remains a solid entry in the genre and there is a lot of fun to be had with it, even if you have played a dozen other dice placement games.

A relatively quick game where you select your actions based on your dice roll. Ultimately it is a game of area control and you're trying to get a system going to get your colonies on the planet. I liked the mechanics and the economic aspects of the game.

There is an aggressive element to the game, where others can really beat you up. But I guess that is true of any area control game. Also, being the one to finish the game (by rolling correctly and placing your last colony) is extremely important since you have such control of the final scoring.

I have played it with Outer belt expansion not long ago. there is a brilliant  mechanics with dice. Easy to learn. In turn or two you know what to do. I love the design and retro, ray-punk, space theme. But there is a drawback. Firstly it is an AP prone game. On each player's turn you throw dice and then even if you are fast decision maker, it takes too long to place up 6 or7 dice on to action spaces. That starts to drag down a fun a bit. I can't imagine having a AP player in a game. It would take more than 10 min to complete his/hers move.
 And the last thing... The raiders outpost... that is mean action place. The idea to steal resources from your opponent, that he is so much struggling to get,  is a bit too much for me. Let say, when you initiate those  actions it just drags players into a neverending retaliations which is a nerve-wrecking waste of time and resources. It might be for some people but not so much for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.25
A simple but mean dice placement game with the potential for clever play. Finding ways to gather and immediately spend resources, so as to not have your hoarded resources stolen, is an interesting puzzle. A puzzle that can have various solutions depending on the special abilities you have accumulated throughout the game.

great worker placement game.  I love the aspect of having dice and picking them up to roll them each turn to affect your allocation.  I didn't really use the alien tech cards my first play, but I see their value in the game.  I like that this is a pretty simple game that I feel confident enough to teach to non-gamers, and it won't just blow over their head.  has some great strategy, and I like the randomness of the dice.

Similar to Kingsburg in some ways, and different in plenty other.  It plays fairly quick without of a lot of detail to bog you down.  I feel that you need to watch the leader and whack them down while trying to balance your own objective to win.  Overall, I find this a very good dice placement game.

If Castles of Burgundy and ... maybe Kingsburg had a baby (Kingsburg would be so lucky if CoB even found it attractive), it would be this. The best of both. Your dice are the action selection, like both - but they don't determine the QUALITY of your actions as much as in Kingsburg, so it's more like CoB there. And you get the resource juggling of Kingsburg, but better. And I'm FINALLY going to own it - preordered through the 4th Ed. Kickstarter.

RATING: 8
Very good dice placement game that smoothly combines elements of area majority with special card abilities. The rules are very elegant and the iconography is clear and easy to digest. I was surprised by the amount of player interaction on the board - the game is full of "take that" moments so it definitely won't appeal to everyone.

The overall enjoyment is somewhat diminished by significant downtime between turns that gets longer and longer as the game progresses. There are times when you just get bored when your opponents try to figure out a perfect way of placing all of their dice (but I guess it all depends on the players - just try not to overthink your actions). 

Still, Alien Frontiers is a super solid, interesting design, check it out if you can. I would love to play it again, my rating will most probably go up with subsequent plays. I enjoyed this game a lot.

This game plays in a similar fashion to Kingsburg but I like it better.  There are less chances to get blocked and more options if you do get blocked from what you want.  Great game.

RATING: 8.2
What I Love- 
Manageable dice luck. Most rolls have things you can do,choices. Cards to manage dice luck. Competing for your engine with colony bonuses. 

What I dislike-
Some rolls, the best choice is to just block resources your opponent needs, instead of furthering your goals. I have effectively denied an opponent ore or vice versa, while systematically building new ships, leading for a near insurmountable advantage in the 2-player game. More ships=better chances of useable dice rolls. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A solid first effort by a new game company.  Some people will love it, but it is just ok by my account.

In it's scoring, it is an area control game.  But, there isn't a lot happening on that front.  There really aren't enough pieces going on the board/moving around to really move control around very much.

So, what you really have is a dice based resource collecting/building game. My problem is that it takes a relatively long time to play what is fundamentally a pretty light game.  

Here's the problem.  There are about 10 places you can put your dice.  Some need high numbers, some low, some pairs, some trips, etc.  If you put dice in one place, you might get something that impacts your ability to use dice in another place.  Plus, everyone will ultimately have 2-4 cards that possibly let you manipulate the dice.  

When the game starts, you have 3 dice, so decisions are relatively easy.  However, later on, you have up to 6 (and possibly 7) dice to roll and place.  Which, of course, you really can't plan until you roll them.  So, when you roll all the dice, you need to stop and think about how to place them, add pips, get resources, etc. in a reasonable way.  Even for "fast" players this process can take a few minutes . . . while everyone else waits. 

Also, I think there is a bit of a rich get richer problem, where people who get additional dice early can really pull away quickly.

I love everything about this game. It is just so satisfying placing the dice on the docks and placing the colonies. So satisfying!

RATING: 7.5
This is probably my favorite game in the "worker placement" genre. Everything from the application of the theme to the excellent array of options for player interaction make this game fit my tastes just a bit more than other popular choices like Lords of Waterdeep or Kingsburg.

There are many different ways to strive for victory and, unlike some other games of its kind, if you find yourself constantly blocked by other players, there are a variety of ways to deal with it.

I like it over Kingsburg for the ability to grow your dice pool and for the variety of much more interactive cards and abilities and I like it over Waterdeep for the larger variety of ways to score your points.

An excellent game.

this is a genre of gama that i like, even if there are many dice. rules are simple and most of all the game flow is simple: throw dice, place dice, do actions, repeat. many interesting decisions, several paths to victory.

After two games am still a little disappointed. First game was a bigger disappointment as it took sloop long to complete. 2nd game (with 3 players and one less station than the rules suggested) it played quicker. I guess might need to try one further game to solidify my opinion..rather shakily sitting on the 'might hit the trade pile' list.

RATING: 8
Fun game.  Nice mechanics, where the dice roll dictate your possible actions.  Downside of this mechanic is that you cannot pre-plan your strategy with any certainty, so players must be able to adapt to Plan B or C.  Lots of interaction with blocking actions and stealing resources, cards, and territories from other players.  Because territories can switch possession, there usually isn't a runaway leader problem.  The game has a nice 2-hour length with 4 players, but AP-prone players can extend this by another hour.

RATING: 5.5
Some weird timing issues and feedback loops, and the need to roll doubles early in the game is paramount.

I'd play again, but my magic 8-ball (or six-sider, in this case) tells me that my rating will likely drop rather than improve.

Dice represent your ships. The more you have, the more you can do. Similar to Kingsburg in that you get to choose which combinations of dice you want to use to gain more stuff. Really drags after everyone has more dice. I like the first 2/3 of the game.

This used to be one of my favorite games. I really like the variety in strategies you can have and how the score constantly goes back and fourth. This is a very competitive game, not recommended if you can't handle direct confrontation.

Although I love this game, I'm afraid it won't hit the table as often as I'd like to. Mainly because it has a decent amount of AP, downtime is horrible and usually is either snowballing or a constant bash-the-leader exercise. Not the kind of game people are usually willing to play.

Very solid game. Really scratches the "assign these dice" itch extremely well. Unlike To Court the King the decision tree is not too bushy by the end of the game. All of the things I like about Kingsburg but with more flexibility. Really a fun game both with gamers and kids. Yes there is some leader bashing near the end but I feel it adds to the suspense.

Outstanding artwork. This game deserves extra credit for having a SCFI theme and not defaulting to some historical trading theme.

Tyler's favorite game. I enjoy it from time to time, but I really prefer it with 2 or 3. I think 3 is really the sweet spot. Four takes way to long for my tastes (unless you severely reduce the number of colonies from the suggested amount, which isn't very fun), since I can't spend my time between turns planning out my own turn. I never want to play this with 5 (or god forbid, 6 )

Intoxicating dice placement champ.  Can't play it enough!  Played a terrible game of this last night where I was unable to roll doubles (and then was blocked by all three opponents) or get cards to modify my rolls as my three opponents upgraded to 4 and 5 ships in the first two rounds.  Timing allowed me to grab some ore, which was promptly stolen from me.  FUCK THAT.  Hadn't realized the game could be SO harsh and lopsided early.  Dropping score from 9.7.

Alien Frontiers can be as aggressive or passive, depending on the players. Even with 4, it is not too difficult to avoid other players, especially in colony placement. Different strategies and development tracks all seem equivalent, which can negate the disadvantage of being blocked. The rules are very well done with examples that address any ambiguity.

Very solid game. Starts off slow but picks up as players jockey for highest score. Plays extremely well with 2 or 4 players.

5 of the games I've played, I've gotten the Resource Cache card to start. Just weird, but it's an incredible boost to your first few turns.

More plays are leading to very close games, indicating it is very well balanced at least at 4. 2-player games can lead to runaway leaders but it's not as prevalent as other games.

A very solid Worker-placement that oozes theme.  Great dice to placement mechanic with a lot of both strategic & tactical decisions.  You will be bumping up against other players very often - stealing their goods & taking their land, so you need to have a heart for that type of game.  

I personally really dig it, but it doesn't quite get the top tier of its category.  Analysis paralysis in this one is huge with people often wanting to "redo" their turns once they figure out the math in their head of what other possible scenarios are.  With this, the downtime between turns can be a bit frustrating.

Overall a solid B type of game.

Excellent dice rolling game. Far better than Kingsburg for example : more control, less random, good flow... and an excellent thematic.
A must have in this category.

This is a really excellent multi-use dice game. I enjoy the player interaction and sense of build-up. The victory condition is a bit lacking though.

an actually fun version of Kingsburg.  maybe it's the theme i like better.  But the dice placement also seems to be more fun.  one potential problem, though i'm sure some might not think of it as a problem, is that the game is so well balanced, that everyone's ending score is within one of everyone else -- or as a friend of mine might say... a statistical tie.  i would prefer a little more gap.  it's very cutthroat too.

after more plays, the closeness of the score seems just built into the game, and there's no workaround.  it is actually fun though, and very strategic.

In my one play of this game, I was turned off by the way it ended. It seemed abrupt and unfair to all eventhough I won.I really want to like this game more, but seem to like other "dice" games better.

Currently own 4th edition with plastic and wooden colonies (from earlier version). Includes: [gameid=161118], [gameid=161120]. [gameid=161121]

Decisions can be quite obvious based on the dice rolls. And once one is behind, it is quite hard to catch up. Reasonable player interaction and is still quite fun.

Came to this one late. Dice as workers has been done in better games since and Alien Frontiers hasn't really stood the test of time in our view. Played once and moved to the trade pile.

love me some dice games...this reminds me of Alea Iacta Est, with the dice placements (straights, pairs, three-of-a-kinds, greater than, etc.)...space theme, cool art, fast playing...my only gripe would be that it ends so abruptly!...8 colonies fixes that a bit, expansions will help it more...

I'm very happy that I fell for Clever Mojo Games' "games remaining" countdown and placed a preorder. The publisher confirmed that I nabbed the 2nd to last copy. Phew! :)

Alien Frontiers is a blast to play. Sure there is some inherit downtime, as is common to dice games of this type (games where you roll all your dice at the start of your turn, then look over the board situation to see what you can do with them), but it's not too bad. We're a group prone to slow play, and we still easily finish this game in 60 minutes including rules explanation, and with repeat play ~45 is the norm.

When Alien Frontiers is played with players that embrace its competitive nature, its area control aspect, the worker placement nature of tactically placing your dice on the board, all seasoned with a good heaping of "take-that", then you have yourself a winner! This game delivers in a very satisfactory manner.

Even in defeat you always feel good about yourself, since you almost certainly pulled of some amazing combo during the game, that left you feeling particularly clever, and you can always blame your defeat on your poor luck, other players' good luck, or just them conspiring to keep you down. ;)

I consider Alien Frontiers a gamer's game, but it is still light enough that you can chat it up while playing. Normally this entails cheering for people to roll poorly, groaning as they block the space station you were depending on to use next turn, etc. This more than makes up for any downtime between turns.

In my opinion the game is not good with 2 players, it's great with 3 as long as you avoid double-teaming the 3rd player, and it's also quite good with 4 players. When playing 4-player games, I keep telling everyone to play as quickly as possible, otherwise the downtime can become a bother. I will never play the Long Version, where each player starts with 8 Colonies, again, it just drains the fun out of the game, and you can play two games in the time it takes to play the long version.

[b]THE KING OF THE MOON:[/b]

1. Great space exploration theme.
2. Tight scoring. This leads into 3.
3. Well balanced.
4. Nice Dan Dare style art.
5. Subdued graphic design compliments the bright chunky dice extremely well.
6. Component quality is high.
7. Fun and interesting decisions. An enjoyable game.
8. I happen to like rolling and placing dice - this game does that by the atomic-shovel load.

[b]THE CHARCOAL BURNER ON THE DARK SIDE OF THE MOON:[/b]

1. Severe kingmaking. A few further games in and this is becoming even more acute - it's a real "ganking" experience.
2. Very tight scoring. Very tight.
3. Initially bewildering array of options on your turn, what with having to read the tech cards as well.
4. High screwage factor. Yes, you can bare grudges, crippling other players, possibly also losing the game to anyone involving themselves in grudge-wars.
5. No meaningful strategy. You simply cannot plan ahead as there are too many variables involved - other player's actions, and also the simple action of rolling dice each turn, adds considerable chaos.
6. Could be prone to AP - purely because you are unable to plan your turn in the downtime periods.
7. It seemed to me that as the game progresses, your tactical options narrow considerably. Funny when you consider that you will probably have more dice (spaceships) to place. This might be particularly acute when you have 5 bio-domes on the surface of the unnamed planetoid, and are unable, due to victory point standings, to place your last dome. It felt like there was little to do at this point, except go for alien technologies.
8. Straight away it is blindly obvious that the optimal positional plays on the planet is to only put 1 more bio-dome down than anyone else. There seemed no reward for concentrating on a region.
9. Dicefest and all that that entails. All the optimal play-thinking will do bollocks if you never roll any doubles - unlikely, but possible. Also, through no fault of your own, you could easily be blocked from doing any meaningful actions, rolls depending. Not fair to trash a dice game for having dice, however.
10. Space-Euro. When will somebody resurrect the AT-space genre?
11. Space Raiders might be the best option most turns, if you can roll a Yahtzee. This appears to be the case on repeated plays, as you elevate your position by using space pirates to steal from your opponents - whose position is lowered (it's a double gain). I tried this strategy out last game, using a tech card that altered a pip - which was good for creating straights 2-3-4, etc - and won fairly easily. Not sure if this is a good thing. It felt good.

I jumped on the kickstarter pre-order for this game and had a lot of fun keeping up on the updates... but I've found the game is just not for me.  As a fan of "purer" worker placement I never really fell in love with relying on the dice to make my moves... though puzzling out the best moves could be enjoyable.  In the end it seemed like most wins are not in the hands of the winning player but very reliant on the moves of other player's king-making.  I'm sure a lot of people would be very happy with this game... but it just wasn't a good fit for me and was traded away.

This is a great dice game that includes cards, two resources, and a cool map. This game is great with 3 or more players. 2 players is not as intriguing but it still can be fun. This games lasts about 1 to 1.5 hours for experienced players. For newer players count on at least 1.5 hours or more.

This is a wonderful game! The mechanics are overall pretty simple, but offer much depth once you manage to understand what every section of the board does. I'm also a big fan of how the various spaces on the planet interact with each of the stations. The mitigation provided by the tech cards is a big plus as well, and helps players who go in that direction to feel less helpless when they roll their dice and don't get what they want. Nice, simple game, but with a great breadth of strategies to explore!

Kingsburgian, in that you roll your own personal set of dice and place them in different locations based on value and need.

The attack space is game-breakingly overpowered in my opinion.  Like the Settlers robber on steroids and pcp.  Might be a better game if it gets nerfed in house rules.

The rest of the spaces are creative and varied, with a couple valuable dumping grounds for bad rolls.

The area-control regions are all named after old scifi authors, a neat little easter egg.  The generic six-sided dice are rather ugly, and the game as a whole has a prototype look and feel.

I rather like the various applications for the dice.  There are good mechanisms that interact well; however, there's more tearing down of opponents than I tend to prefer in my games.

Great worker placement game. I love that there's always somewhere to place your dice and another player is not able to *completely* block you off from an action. I also love that no matter what you roll, there's an optimal action to do. Theme is well-executed down to the names of the colonies.

Medium depth, and the existence of the raiding party allows for direct interaction.  To a certain extent luck will sometimes force you into a corner (eg if you roll 1,2,4 for the whole game and you didn't start with a die manipulation card you're not going to win) but this is rare.

Dropped from a 7 to a 6.5 when I started playing Castles of Burgundy.  The latter has similar mechanics and is just more fun.  I will grant you that the theme of Alien Frontiers is way cuter than CoB though.

Owning the board game almost becomes superfluous with the iOS version available.  I traded it because owning the board game for fifty bucks isn't worth it, but owning the iOS version for five bucks is.

I enjoy this game a lot. There are always good actions to be taken with your dice and lots of way to manipulate them into something good.

Excellent graphical design. The game has issues though : analysis paralysis is huge during turns. You can not plan a strategy since you do not know what dice you will roll. The raid location has been discussed in my group for being too strong, but you can learn how to block the spot and develop a strategy to spend your resources before they get stolen, so in my opinion it's fine.

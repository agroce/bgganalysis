Very impressed by this little game. It fulfills what it promises: A fast game, but not without strategy, that gives a sense of a race against the opponent to get the best booty. The two player option that forces you to destroy a treasure plus steal one adds one more component to the strategy and certain malice that my wife and I thoroughly enjoy and add flavor to the game theme: There is no honor among thieves! The cards are of very good quality as well as the score tiles but the stands of characters are somewhat small and tend to fall. The art is very well done. Colorful, detailed and with a style that feels very good to the game. The graphic design is another aspect to emphasize, that without being dazzling, it helps the readability and gameplay. Surely this will be a game that will hit the table often. Glad to have backed it up!
Muy impresionado por este pequeño juego. Cumple lo que promete con creces: Un juego rápido, pero no carente de estrategia, que da sensación de una carrera contra el oponente por conseguir el mejor botín. La opción de dos jugadores que obliga a destruir un tesoro ademas de robar uno agrega un componente más en la estrategia  y cierta malícia que mi esposa y yo disfrutamos mucho y agrega sabor al tema del juego: No hay honor entre ladrones! Las cartas son de muy buena calidad así como las losetas de puntaje pero los stands de personajes son algo pequeñas y tienden a caerse. El arte está muy bien logrado. Colorido, detallado y con un estilo que sienta muy bien al juego. El diseño grafico es otro aspecto a remarcar, que sin ser deslumbrante, ayuda a la legibilidad y jugabilidad. Seguramente este será un juego que golpeará la mesa a menudo. Contento de haberlo respaldado!

Light drafting game with an "open-market" format, which mercifully makes memory far less of a requirement when deciding what to take (though you still do have to keep track of cards your opponents acquire). It also does play in 10-minutes, so the game does exactly what it promises.

I've found decisions to be a little too obvious, however, and the game is just a little too short and simple for my liking. I like the card powers, and would like to see more of those or more complex/interesting scoring mechanisms added to the core rules. As it is, the game is just "okay."

RATING: 6
Filler game in which players take on the role of a burglar trying to collect a number of objects (cards). Points are gained for most cards of a particular colour and of a particular value, for leaving the tower first or second, for having least cursed cards, and points are lost for having most cursed cards and leaving last. Some of the cards are multi-coloured or multi-valued, and yet other cards can be used to perform specific actions, like removing a cursed card from your collection or adding curses to another player's collection.

Very nice looking, colorful game, with simple and clear rules, set up time of 3 min, and play time of 10 min. On your move just go and pick a treasure, but beware of what other players are collecting. Quite brainstorming for such a small game.

A cute, super short filler that takes about, I don't, I'd say 11 minutes to play. ;p)

Each turn you move your guy/gal to a spot and take a card. You're trying to collect the highest total value in as many sets as you can (realistically 2). Cards score for endgame majority (only most; no second/third place scoring). The catch is, you can never move back once you move forward. 

It's short and there are some nice decisions for which cards to take vs skip over as well as when to get the hell out of the wizard's tower and end your game as the last player out loses 3VP.

Cute game that works well for what it sets out to do.

A fun little set collection game. It uses the mechanism where you can go as far ahead as you want, but you cannot go back, like Tokaido and Glen More. It's simple, plays fast and looks good.

RATING: 10
This is exactly the type of game that I enjoy playing. Decisions are deep - yet not guaranteed to give you the results you want ;-) This game will be a filler for many a gaming table, but I appreciate the simple mechanics that effortlessly lead to complexity. It is a lot of game in a small box. That makes me happy. If you like the elegance of Kingdomino, or the addictive replayability of Star Realms you will like Nick Sibicky's little gem. 

If you are an educator or a parent of children learning addition. This is exactly the type of game that should be brought out every week in your classroom or home. It is fast and graphically stunning.

The artwork on this game really stands out. Setup and gameplay mechanics are very simple but there is some strategic decision making in the game. This would probably be more fun with 3-4 players. A good filler but one I may not get to play very often.

This is a featherweight game, so my rating reflects an attempt to rate it for what it is. Naturally, it doesn't compare to the best strategic games, but it has a lot going for it: very elegant, respectable, minimalistic design with some twists; superb art, theme, and humor; standees!; super easy to teach. All in all, a quality package.

Set collection via drafting in a nice 10 minute filler. Every card begins revealed and players take turns simply choosing which one they want. The twist is that you can never choose from the row above. All draft selections will move further down the tower. This introduces an element pushing luck to see how many drafts you can sneak out before an opponent chooses a lower-leveled card that is powerful. 10 Minute Heist checks all the boxes for a nice filler. It doesn't have the depth to stay forever, but I look forward to playing it again.

RATING: 6
Fun, light, majority-collecting game that is pretty close to ten minutes per game.  As a two-player, it is easy to look at what majorities the other player has and try to strategize, and players are always taking a gamble with each move that the other person will take the card they need while they are busy collecting one they want.  The cursed item powers add a great element to the game, balancing end-game scoring, set collecting, or other aspects of gameplay.  
At a higher player count, there is even more strategizing, and gives far more interesting player decisions.

Kickstarter. Easy to learn. Can be set up, explained and played in less than half an hour. Good filler. Light game with simple strategy and a fair bit of chance. Play for fun, but not with a competetive calculating player. Two player variant is not that good, and it gets "crowded" with four (or five), so it works best with three.

Its not very common to have a short, yet strategic game but this one does it well.  Set up 2 Min, Teach 1 Min and 10 min to play (Maybe 15 if you have 4 players and some have AP).  Its a great filler game, and for once its not really a luck based game. (Insert dice chuck game here).

One of the things that I love are the tough decisions you have to make as you travel down the tower.  Do you focus on a few types of treasure guaranteeing your points or do you risk hoping to win majority.  Do you strike a balance between type and numbered treasures (3,4,5) .... the specialty cards always add a twist. I think its simple, unique and strategic.  I like it A LOT. 

Played it about 15 times now and I'm not sick of it yet. 

GREAT JOB! GO KICKSTARTER!

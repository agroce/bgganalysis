This is an excellent add-on for The Unexpected Journey or as a stand alone game.  It is a little easier than the first game but the addition of the Smaug token and the dwarves coming out of the barrells is fun.  The components are excellent quality.  If I was going to just get one of the two games I would get The Unexpected Journey but given the fact that buying them both together gives you free Amazon shipping it is well worth it to get both to play together.

**Update**

Four and a half months later from my first game and this is still my favorite game!  I finally defeated both games cojoined at the highest level finishing with 17 points after surviving a final roll for three rabbits on board 3 that would have eneded the gane.  It took 4 total plays on the hardest level to finally defeat it.  Great game!!!

This should have been a $20 expansion to [thing=140612][/thing] instead of another $40 game.  80% of the components are identical to the first game.  That said, if you liked the first game you will enjoy this one since the gameplay is the same.  I lost interest in it quickly.

I really enjoy playing this.  Quick co-op light enough to carry on a conversation but enough decisions to keep me engaged.  I think a very good balance and underrated by BGG.  If you see this available in your local store pick up a copy.

The sequel to The Unexpected Journey, which continues the story onto boards 3 and 4.

Players guide Bilbo and the dwarves through the second part of the Hobbit trilogy.  Pleasant cooperative die roller, where players must work together to get through two adventure boards.  The boards contain events from the book/movie, and consist of icons that must be rolled to pass.  A basic turn is a roll of four dice, plus one reroll, but this can be seasoned with the abilities of the dwarves, Bilbo, and/or with precious resources (which keep you moving but cost you final victory points).  

It all sounds rather basic, but a deck of event cards ramps up the tension, putting hazards in the path of the players, or even worse, upgrading challenges to tougher variants.  So tempo must be maintained before the game overwhelmes you.

Very nice cooperative game in an increasingly tired genre.  All the players are engaged, and the levelling system offers a serious challenge to experienced players.  The new boards offer good challenges, especially board 4, with the dwarves appearing out of the barrels, and the Smaug track adding pressure to the players.  

Good game, but we expect no less from Knizia.

Never buy ANY games based on a movie, book or a television show, you are certain to get screwed!

Also, this game is kinda boring. It also feels and looks like all the other LotR games. Made in a haste to make a quick buck.

Wouldn't buy and would get rid of it if someone gave it to me.

I was looking for a game like Elder Sign, mostly for solo play.  I don't have the first Hobbit Game in this series, but the game seemed to play fine by itself (and has rules for continuing from the previous game or for starting with this one).  I found it to be just the right level of challenge.

Fun movie tie-in co-op. I works better as the second half of a two game set. I'm a little disappointed they never came out with the third game.

"sequel" of the first episode of the Hobbit board game - the game cut in three pieces and probably made longer just to fit Peter Jackson's tied-in monster of a movie trilogy. The gameplay is the same on the first side of the board (maybe a bit harder than the previous ones, still rather easy to win) and things get different with the dragon side which adds a little fun variety to the game. This side makes it slightly superior to the first one.

Got this as a (sort of) surprise gift from my mom. I'm quite happy with it because it is just the correct weight and style of game to play with my parents. Oh, and my wife liked it rather well too so there's a couple big plusses!

My opinion is that it's a fine little game, but perhaps the sort I usually don't buy myself because I only want games I love. However, since I really did enjoy playing, and it's a good one for family/friends who aren't really gamers, I think I'll keep it and bring it out in that sort of setting. Having the license to a well-known theme with recognizable characters is a plus for this use as well.

It's pretty well discounted in most avenues now, I would probably recommend picking one up for ~$20 or so, but I wouldn't have wanted to pay full retail for this. There are big creases in the boards (as many have noticed) and overall the components feel a little... not exactly flimsy, but definitely "budget" level.

Much better than Knizia's previous Hobbit games. Kind of annoying that this is a game of scores rather than winning or losing, but the game is enjoyable regardless. Along with Unexpected Journey, this covers the best parts of the story, and this feels like a good companion game to his LOTR cooperative game. This version of the game is far less difficult than Unexpected Journey, however, which makes for a campaign that gets easier as you go along.

I enjoy these games and it's a shame that the third game doesn't look to be coming out.  Not as good as Knizia's earlier LOTR game, but this one is lighter and nice for playing with the kids.  The dragon track and character card acquisition changes on the 4th Board are nice tweaks to the gameplay from the other three boards.

----Preliminary thoughts----

I just saw Tom Vasel review, but it seems very similar to the previous game (2 new boards, same mechanics). I'll add what I posted there. To be confirmed!

Quite similar to Elder Sign, many of its mechanics are here. Maybe a bit less random, a bit more cooperative (still feels like a Solo game that can accomodate several players), more difficult, but also a bit more abstract (Knizia trademark).

It's also based on scores besides winning and losing.

Replayability is in question?

It will have a part 3 after the respective movie.

RATING: 7
Probably close to the same quality as the first game, but I felt the difficulty was lessened. I beat my first game of Desolation of Smaug without much trouble, whereas the first game took me many plays. Just not quite as brutal. I do like the dragon track though.

RATING: 5
A simplistic euro-game with a paper thin theme. Unfortunately the high-quality components are not enough to make you want to play this game a second time. You can either easily beat this game or go for a high score, neither is very rewarding and "winning" feels more like you just completed a puzzle than won a game. This game appeared to have worked its way onto a major retailer's shelves at some point but was quickly demoted to the bargain bin when customers likely felt conned by the nice box art and abstracted game play.

Pros:
* High quality components.

Cons:
* Low replay value.

RATING: 7
A fairly decent continuation of the first instalment, with no real major twists, but at least some echoes of the subject matter. A third one most likely not coming, which is a good thing, since this feels complete enough as it is, and would not deliver anything significant in terms of gameplay. Got plenty of games covering the 5 armies alone anyways!

I bought this game for less than $10 on a lark, figuring I couldn't lose for the price.  It has turned into one of my favorites.  As a cooperative game, it's a lot of fun to play with the kids, and unlike many cooperatives, we really have to discuss sometimes how to sort the dice, or whether to burn a resource, or whether to share company cards.  Also unlike many cooperatives, we've had the full range of results from losing to winning big.  Randomness does play into the game, not only with dice rolling but in what order the event cards turn up, but your strategies and team play also play a role.  We do not have the first game and it's quite fun just with the sequel on its own.

A stand-alone game but plays best as a continuation of the first game in the series.  We'll have to wait another year before the final one is released.  Good co-op mechanism from Knizia involving dice rolls and resource conservation.

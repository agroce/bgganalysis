GAME: BANG! The Dice Game
RANK: 461
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3.8
I think maybe this could be fun if I was drunk enough. The rating seems about right. Worth another chance if it's the only game in the room and I'm at least buzzing.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Rating based on one 6 player play and a great fun play it was!
It was fairly obvious who the outlaws were quite soon, but we couldn't tell who the deputy and renegade were for a long time. That and the shock ending, when Indians killed the sheriff when two outlaws were dead made the game. Not sure if you'd get that every time.
The game did seem a bit longer that I expected, but I far preferred it to the card game.

Played a few more times now and upped the rating to an 8.
Fun, quickfire and want to play again feeling.

3 more games and upped rating to 8.5 - can't quite bring myself to go to a 9. Seems to rely on having 6 players to hit this level of consistent fun.

7 players and still very good....

RATING: 5
Mercifully shorter and simpler than Bang the card game. There really isn't too much here, but what else can you expect from a 15 minute hidden role game. 

Needs 6 plus, but it squeezes in to those precious few minutes before you are serving dinner.

It would never be my game of choice for an evening with gamers, but for quick brain dead fun? Sure!

This is such an improvement to BANG that I don't think the original will come out any longer.

Very good components make this my filler of choice and probably as well my party game of choice.

Cool game that feels like Shadow Hunters meets King of Tokyo.  I've had games drag a bit near the end which is a big no-no for a player elimination game.

I'm also not a big fan of hidden teams because it makes the first few decisions rather contrived and formless.

I just do not get it. Why does the Sheriff have to reveal his identity? This takes all the fun out of the game. Outlaws know who to target, and so do the Vice and the Renegade. Anyways, plays fast and the dice mechanic is just the right choice for a game like this.

Played this with friends on the 4th of July.  In the first game I was an Outlaw, pitted against my husband, who was the Sheriff.  It was a fun game, and on my first turn I managed to gattling the group!  Needless to say... I was identified as an Outlaw fairly quickly and taken out long before the end.  But it was worth it.

The second game I was a Renegade and played it much better.  I went with the strategy of healing the Sheriff, keeping him alive from the Outlaws... though eventually I was taken out by one of the Deputies.  And I'm pretty happy at how I managed to figure out what role everyone had before I was taken out.  I managed to damage the other Renegade too!

RATING: 7
A quick to play, fun 'spaghetti western' dice game. The three player game can be very short (too short) and might benefit from allocating players more 'health' (bullets) or perhaps using the 'Old Saloon' expansion's 'Coward' die? The abilities of two of the female characters (Rose Doolan and Calamity Janet) are useless in the three player game and these character cards should be discarded in this situation.

I'm a little conflicted about this one.  It has a little more luck, sure, but not that much more than cards.  You can't really guard against shots...and that's what keeps the game short.  You can get 2 games of this one in for the time of 1 original [b]Bang![/b].  (Kinda my same dilemma about [b]Forbidden Island[/b]: if you can get 80% of [b]Pandemic[/b] in half the playing time, what would you play?)  It also fixes some of [b]Bang![/b]'s problems, like the no-turn-kill.  Sure, it lacks some card variety, but still has interesting decisions.  I'm impressed that they kept so much of the original ruleset!

I played this game just once, so these are mostly impressions that may change after multiple plays.

I'm not a fan of social deduction games, especially when they rely too much on reading other people's faces and they don't provide solid mechanisms to base your bluffing on.

This is yet another dull social deduction game for me for this very reason. I just don't see where the fun is and how you're supposed to back up your arguments. I'm getting very tired of trying game after game in this genre just to find that they all feel the same.

I know that there's plenty of people who enjoy this game for many reasons. I'm just not one of them. Boring, uninspiring, repetitive and shallow. A pass for me.

1st plays: I got eliminated quickly in the first round and almost won in the second round. I'm not at all a fan of Bang! but this one plays quickly and has variable player powers. There isn't much strategy here unfortunately, outlaws attack sheriff, deputy helps sheriff, renegade dies early.

Great party game. Apart from some bluffing skills, and some small amount of strategic thinking, you need a lot of luck for this one. This doesn't hurt the game much, because it's quick, fun, and also: shooting your friends never gets old.

I love this game, I think it's perfect for a party or people who don't want to think too much. I like this version a lot more than the original BANG game because this one is fast and snappy. It makes me feel like I'm in the Wild West! There's bullets flying, beer is free flowing, some dingus is chucking dynamite around... it's crazy and the dice rolling fit perfectly into the theme. Risk it all in the Wild West! Even better with the expansion.

I love this game. It scales very well. Its easy to teach and its a fun theme. At first the hidden roles aspect seemed simple and obvious but the more I play it, the more I see ways to play it smartly. One big negative is its possible for one or two players to get eliminated very early. I try to mitigate this during the rules explanation by recommending that you only weaken a player until youre absolutely certain they are your enemy or you risk losing a much needed ally. I also highly recommend the Old Saloon expansion and dont play without it (though the game is still excellent at the base level!)

My group absolutely adores this game and as of writing is our go to party game.  It helps that we've turned it into a mini-drinking game where you have to take a drink whenever you gain or lose life (beer).  The hidden roles can be somewhat tricky to determine by people playing the opposite of how you would expect at the beginning and switching at the oh so crucial moment.  The renegade doesn't win that often, but when they do it makes for some of the most memorable games we've had.  I've had success teaching to both gamers and non-gamers and almost always play multiple games back to back.  Highly recommend!

My initial impressions are positive although it's heavily reliant on luck and dice rolls which will give it a lower score for me. I enjoy the characters and their powers are creative and fun.

A really fun, fast dice game with some smooth reroll mechanics. Basically this is King of Tokyo set in the Wild West, with some caricatures of classic cowboy and outlaw characters. Not quite as fun as that other game, but it's great if you have a few minutes with friends who dig Westerns. Would be nice to have a few mini expansions, and until that point, contrary to popular belief, I prefer the BANG! card game for its added variety. But this is a nice transfer of that feel onto the dice.

This is not really my type of game, but for a party game it is pretty fun. I wouldn't want to play it all the time, but if if I have a group of non-gamers together, then this is a pretty fun and humorous game to pull out. My only complaint is that a person who doesn't totally get the game can make everyone's roll obvious right from the get go.

The BGG hype says this is game to improves and replace Bang! (the card game). Is this really true?

Well, it does remove the most annoying parts of the game and makes it shorter as well. It adds some more push-your-luck elements like the arrows mechanic (roll arrows and get arrow tokens; once all tokens have been taken, Indians attack and all players lose 1 life per arrow, with arrows returned to the center).

But it don't think it really improved the hidden roles part of the game. Once the bandits figure out who the deputy and the desperado, they gun them down and then go after the sheriff. Not much there.

So while I will play, I wont seek it out.

Great secret identity game with plenty of variation and RNG. I have played both the original card version and the dice version and prefer this one more due to the RNG nature of it. It's a nice little product, super easy to pickup and it's always fun to bluff and call out your friends or strangers for that matter for lying about being the deputy. I'd suggest this game if you like social deduction types of games, that move quickly between start & end times.

Bang! Express.  Can Bang! be fun?  Yes, [i]right crowd, right mood[/i] & Bang! is fun.  Is this a good implementation of Bang!?  Yes, this system works very well as a dice game.  I especially like the arrow mechanic where you have to take the hit, but you can still reroll.  No, it's definitely not as good as the [u][i]very[/i][/u] similar but meatier King of Tokyo, but try explaining KoT to my non-gamer family.

Shortens the play time of original Bang!, but at the same time, takes away your ability to choose who to shoot, which is a big part of Bang!. Still a fun game though, can be played in a very short amount of time, so that's a big plus when you just want to roll some dice and trash talk your opponents.

RATING: 7
Fast dice filler that makes the player elimination not that obnoxious since you will be playing soon enough again. Slightly on the luckier-based side than its card-game brother which is totally fine since there are surprises each turn for all players.

Though much faster to play than its predecessor, the game ultimately lacks the deliberate actions of the players due to the randomness of the die rolls.

Because I don't know the original game, it's difficult to compare. We played it with four players and I think this is not enough, therefore I don't know at all if my score is right.
Raised my score from 6 to 7 : this is definitely a multi-player game : this game asks for 6 players or more.
I reaaly like this game in a big company : it becomes better by every play : It isn't very balanced, but it is always fun. Score increased to 8.

Lots of folks stated this replaces the original card game but I have to disagree. This removes what little strategy the card game has and turns it into a boring dice rolling affair that essentially plays itself.

Wow!!!! Fun, fun, fun! It takes all of the cool parts of the card game (secret objectives, partnerships, etc) and gets rid of all of the crap as well (complex rules regarding objects, range, etc).

Bang! is a fun conflict-based Yahtzee-style dice rolling game with the added dimension of secret roles.  A short game which doesn't overstay its welcome but always has players interacting and thinking just hard enough but not too hard.  A perfect party game.

Only downside is the minimum 5 player count which keeps it from the table sometimes.

RATING: 8
We recently played this game with our family of 6 individuals ranging from 27-60 in age and everyone enjoyed it. The game is easy to transport and setup and takedown takes no time at all.

The game moves quickly enough to keep everyone's interest and is involved enough to make it so no one feels like they are left out.

The only real drawback I have with this is the balance seems to be skewed in the favor of the outlaws quite heavily. I would say that 4/5 of the games we played were won by the outlaws and everyone seemed to think it may be a little unbalanced.

The game is great for getting people into boardgames and deception games with the rolling of dice which keeps everything interesting and random but lends a hand with the special abilities of each character. All-in-all this is one game that will be broken out when we need a filler game and have a couple beers to drink.

My first game of BANG: TDG was with four players and was extremely disappointing. In fact, saying that the game plays 3-8 seems disingenuous on the part of the publisher, as it was barely functional with four. Further games with six at the table proved much better, but still I feel like the game lacks meaningful decisions. I like the yahtzee-style dice-rolling, but the hidden role part of the game feels limited and superficial. In the end, the outcome of the game can be decided without much input from a significant chunk of players, and it all feels extremely lightweight.

When I first heard about this game I knew it would be perfect for me. I love hidden role/goal games, and I love dice games. Once I tried it I was hooked. This is what the card game should have been from the very beginning. It's fast and it's fun and it cuts right to the heart of what you want to see. Adding in the arrows to help weaken players is great at keeping the game rolling, and it actually adds another strategic decision to make. I think the roles are pretty well balanced and, while the renegade always seems like a tough role to win with, it actually happened in our first game and almost again in our fourth. I've even seen this game come down to those exciting single rolls where the whole table erupts in cheers and gasps as one die brings someone a surprise win or loss. It is a game that is just pure fun, and I'm absolutely delighted to own it.

If I’ll ever have to play Bang again, I’ll take care it’s this dice game, as it takes the best of the card game and plays both better and shorter than the original. [i](November 2013)[/i]

[b]Update[/b] - One of the goals I set for my Fall 2015 rating revise was to limit half-point ratings to a handful of games: since Bang Dice isn’t one of those, I rounded down my rating from 7,5 to 7.

It’s still better than the card game though!

RATING: 8
Needs at least 5 players to shine. Quick, fun hidden role game with some strategy and lots of luck. I wish the player powers were useful more often, it seems like some of them are rarely used. I enjoy the strategies that can develop around taking/giving arrows, esp. with certain player powers.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I had exactly one turn between starting the game and losing. 10/10

Seriously, though, there is an interesting phenomenon I see play out on BGG:
* Classic game exists and is popular, but hobbyists complain about length and randomness.
* Newer, updated or alternate game is created, that is even more random and chaotic, but much shorter.
* Hobbyists praise newer game as "better", even though for the vast majority of reasons the old game was bad, the new game is even worse.

I noticed this too with Monopoly and Hotel Tycoon. (Not that Hotel Tycoon is [i]praised[/i], per se, but in comparison to Monopoly...) People seem to ignore that Hotel Tycoon is much more horribly imbalanced and random than Monopoly — people are just focused on how much shorter it is, so it's "better".

In other words: Hobbyist hates old game, and hates new game too, but at least new game is [i]shorter[/i] so you suffer for a shorter time. That's not praiseworthy, guys.

Bang: The Dice Game is worse than Bang in all ways except for game length. 

bad + short ≠ good

Great game, the hiden role is a minor thing in the game but the dice play is nice, good party game.  Simple game, not long to play, I play 2 or 3 games in a row when i get it on the table.

This is a quick dice roller that I want to love. So far, the games haven't been that exciting. I bought this to play while camping, and it's a good travel game/filler. I need to play it with a larger group to see if the hidden roles make a bigger difference with more players. But so far, it's just try to kill everyone else and survive, vs. spending much time trying to suss out who you need to kill and who is your secret ally.

Bang Dice has the big weakness of being too slow for what it offers. The excitement is never particularly high during the game, which is the death blow to a game with player elimination and no big decisions, bluffing or tactics.

It's not bad though. It offers some tactics, some bluffing, some decision-making, just not enough fun.

It can be pretty swingy with how the roles are distributed around the table which can make for some pretty mediocre games. But when it's a good game, oh boy is it good! 

At 5p, everyone can hit everyone else which makes for a really tight game. It kinda of gets progressively more chaotic up to 8p but that's not an issue for me because the games are usually pretty short. 

There isn't much lying or bluffing compared to other social deduction games but I like that about it.

Dice Game version fixes the problems that plague the card game (too fiddly, too long, too much down time.) Every die face is different and so you actually have meaningful decisions to make.

It's still a light game where your die roll will guide the way moreso than your own strategic decisions. Play it a time or two as an opener, closer or in-betweener.

Half game half activity. A quirky time-waster which will have different rates of success depending on the group of players. The hidden-role-mechanics and the intrigue of subversion really only kicks in at a higher player count. There is some potential for manipulation and diplomatic discourse but it's heavily reliant on the players themselves (whether they fancy a bit of role-playing) and not so much on the game mechanics. 

The most controversial dilemma the game will ask of you to act on is;

Do I... 

A: "Act according to my faction." 
or 
B: "Act obtuse, potentially in a self sabotaging manner, just to create a bit of confusion resulting in a long-term gain of manipulation." 
or 
C: "Act so the Renegade won't win!"

[b]BANG! The Dice Game[/b] captures the feel and flavour of the original [i]BANG![/i] card game, and condenses it into a simple dice rolling game. But some things were left out of the original B!, like the differing weapons.

I've played B! many times, and I'm actually a little bored of that game. B!Dice is a refreshing change of pace from the original, especially because it only takes minutes to play, but having less options than the original makes me think that I would get bored of this one even faster. However, I do think B!Dice is the better of the two games.

I have loads of fun playing this game with my in-laws, but it certainly requires a crowd. The first time we played it with 6 was subversive and strategic--we were guessing to the end. But with 4, it was easy to deduce roles the first round of the game.

For the best experience, I recommend playing this with at least 6 people.

RATING: 2
It's almost exactly like Bang, but plays in half the time.  I can't stand Bang, but was willing to give this a shot on the basis that at least the misery would be confined to 20 minutes.

I made a mistake.  Unbelievably, they managed to make the game even worse with the small tweaks for the dice game version.  One face of each die has an "arrow".  Arrows do nothing except give you damage, so you never want to roll this face.  They exist to penalize you for rerolling, effectively punishing players for exercising the modicum of agency the game allows.  Truly awful.

I really want to like this game.  And I do, though I've only played twice and while it was fun, it didn't quite match my hopes.  Still, my rating may go up when we play again and don't have to slow things down while consulting the rules.

On the subject of rules:  I fear this game may fall into a no-man's land of sorts.  The rules are not too complex for gamers, but the game play may be too simple to hold gamers' interest for long.  And non-gamers may find the rules to be trickier than they are comfortable with.  (I typed up an [url=https://www.boardgamegeek.com/filepage/127890/bang-dice-game-rules-clarification-faq]FAQ[/url] to try to help dispel any rules confusion.)

Fun game that replaces Bang! the card game for me. Most memorable game went something like this.......7 players and I end up as one of the three Outlaws and stick to a strategy of helping the Sheriff sitting beside me every chance I can to prove that I am her Deputy. One of our 3 Outlaws goes after the Sheriff, he is then pegged as Outlaw and nearly killed off and the other Outlaw gets found out and they both get eliminated early not knowing that I am the third Outlaw. I bring up the concern that there are 4 of us claiming to be one of 2 Vice Deputy or a Renegade......there is concern at the table and the blame game starts. The Renegade ends up getting killed off and I was able to turn both Deputy's sitting side by side, against each other in a stand off. They kill one another and flip their cards, positive that each other was the last Outlaw.........After starring at the cards in bewilderment, they both looked up at me accross the table and I give them a sinister grin. Just me alone with the Sheriff. I fooled everybody and the eliminated Outlaws were suddenly overcome by excitement when they realised we could still win this thing.......But my victory would end there because of the special role card of the Sheriff being able to take arrows instead of wounds and the fact that I had topped up her health throughout the game.....I was no match and found myself at the mercy of the Sheriff's swift justice. It was all the making of a classic western movie, played out at my kitchen table. One of my all time favourite moments from game night :)

I've never been a big fan of Bang, but the dice game managed to improve on it a bit by taking the meat of the game and distilling it down into a more streamlined experience. You still get the Sheriff, Deputy, Renegade, and Outlaw roles, and a special ability for each character, but now you just roll dice to heal and deal damage without some of the tedium the card game has.

While I won't play this game much either, it probably means I won't play Bang again.

Was hoping I'd enjoy this one more than I did. It's a decent enough game and it probably is better than Bang! as most posit, but it's not markedly better and you can still get eliminated quickly in bigger games.

This is definitely better than the card game. Mostly because it is over quicker. I also appreciate that dice rolls can force you to attack even if you don't want to.

Due to the short nature of the game, one good bluff is sufficient, making it so that role confusion is an actual possibility.

This was actually a quite nice filler – and definitely better than the original Bang. Sure, the secret teams don’t really work well as it’s pretty obvious early on who is on what team, but it doesn’t matter too much. It’s a fast and funny game in which every player can win despite the odds due to the dice rolls. I think in my first game the sheriff got like 5 arrows and was heavily wounded and killed soon after… I like the “push your luck” mechanism concerning when and which dice to reroll as you can get punished if having too many arrows or dynamite. Pretty good filler as it’s relatively fast yet still have some room for decision-making. And it’s one of those few filler games in which you’re actually attacking each other (so it’s very unlike my favorite fillers No Thanks/For Sale etc.), meaning trash talk is bound to happen!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
An improvement on the card game because it's simpler and quicker which is important if someone is eliminated early on. The arrows and Indian attack are an interesting idea but can be quite deadly. It's still quite possible to be eliminated before your first turn!

Hmm... 

I was hoping for a good lunchtime with coworkers filler. But, after playing half a game, they seemed only mildly interested in this one. And after one proper play, I'm not sure. There's better hidden role games than this (The Resistance, One Night Ultimate Werewolf, Shadow Hunters) and there's better dice filler games (King of Tokyo, Liar's Dice, etc.)

I'm not sure this has staying power in my collection.

Update: ...and my prediction came to pass. Traded this one away, and I don't think there's a single fellow gamer or coworker that's going to miss it.

RATING: 7
A good party game that uses a very familiar Yahtzee mechanic on each player's turn. Roll dice, shoot other people, drink beer, and hurt yourself seems very thematic and it all ties together in well. This plays super fast, and in a way almost too fast as I got 1 turn in our 5-player game before I was eliminated. Yes this makes the game luck based, but it was still fun trying to figure out who is who. I would definitely play it again, but don't see a need to pick it up as it is unlikely I will have 5+ often enough to play it.

Main Positives: I love dice games that does lots of things. 

Fun Factor: High - love the shooting and chugging beer

Main Frustrations and Caveats:
You have to play this with fun people. Nothing negative about that since I do have friends who are fun to be with.

This game is the perfect length in terms of time for what it is.  I also like the amount of luck in this game as it keeps it lighter than a more argumentative bluffing/deduction game.  The game can become a dice rolling fest when it comes down to the sheriff against of an outlaw/renegade competition to win.  I think it plays best at 5 or 6 players, okay at 4 players, and not that great at 3 or less.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Last standing against the Sheriff as the Renegade.  I had the health, I had the turn, I had the experience (the Sheriff was a little girl) but fate had other plans for me and handed me four dynamites on my single roll.  The Sheriff had an easy time gunning me down after that.

Love the fact that the hidden role mechanic doesn't dominate the game, it rather acts as another layer for players to utilise if they wish.

Comes with lovely custom dice, and a nice array of characters with unique abilities for replay-ability.

Very light and enjoyable. Player elimination isn't an issue due to the fast play time.

Love it! One of the game that I bring to office to play on lunchbreak & instant hit with coworkers.
Best game was as solo renegade with outlaws dead while both deputy & sheriff alive. Trick n kill both deputy, then duel the sheriff.
They rarely trust me in this kind of game again..

Truth be told, I had the original BANG! card game, read the rules, and traded it away because I suspected it wasn't right for my gaming group. Playing the dice version I felt the same way, but it was still an OK experience for me.

It's good that the dice streamline the experience and you can just focus on the symbols and what you really need - some beer to heal, watch out for the dynamite, etc. 

I think what doesn't work for me is the randomness that comes out of the hidden roles - it often felt to me like choosing who to attack was a (pardon the pun) shot in the dark. While I still think it's a perfectly fine game, there are just other hidden role games I'd rather be playing, like Shadow Hunters.

Very solid party game. There is much randomness but it is still pleasuring :) The game seems to be expensive for only 5 dice, 30 cards and a bunch of tokens but its replay value is huge. We always laugh when playing the game.

Some things (like equipment) are missing when compared to Bang the card game. Nevertheless it keeps the game simple and quick.

This is a really fun game if you have 5-7 people over and are looking for light social deduction.  People willing to do just a little role playing add to the flavor and fun of the game and is an experience which pairs nicely with good drinks.
The dice are chunky and high-quality all around with the pictures engraved into them.  The few remaining components are all good quality as well.
Ultimately it's a dice game based on luck but there is some opportunity for social deduction with unique characters adding a little twist.  The 3 teams adds some fun decision making as well.  Quality game, I recommend this.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a fun game to play!  Mostly entertaining due to the deduction aspects of the game, and people being falsely accused in their role.  Having played original Bang!, I like how, in this version, turns move quickly and if you are eliminated, you do not need to wait too long for the next game.  Everyone seems to have fun playing this and the game will see the table often because it is easy to learn, short to play, and quite fun.  
My only knock on the game is some of the variable player powers are imbalanced (One of the characters gets double life points when at 4, or below, life ~ that's crazy good! - while another player only gets +2 life if someone is eliminated - which may or may not happen when you need it).

It's BANG! the card game but without the length that makes the card game so frustrating and exhausting. I like the new rules for Indian attacks. But it still suffers from the weak role deduction and arbitrary actions of the original. For the kind of experience this game hopes to provide, I'd pick King of Tokyo or King of New York almost every time.

This game reminds me of a quicker playing King of Tokyo. Games play quickly and the hidden roles is a neat idea making people try to figure out who is who while taking shots at people. I feel that this game gets the same rating as King of Tokyo as it's fun, but if I have more time to play, then I like the feel of building up my monster therefore I'd choose King of Tokyo over this. As a high count quick playing game, this game will remain in my collection.

RATING: 7
Not a lot of depth to this but as a quick fun filler game it is ok if you are prepared not to get too annoyed when you get 'picked on' and killed off quickly. The role cards work ok but there are better 'secret role' games out there.

Update - Having recently played this this as an 8 player game I have to say it worked so much better than the 4-5 player games we had previously played. +1 VP!

The dice version of the popular social deduction game Bang! Yahtzee style dice rolling. Each players each secretly get a role card that assigns them to a team. Sherif, deputy, outlaw, and renegade. Each role has a different win condition. The Sheriff and deputies need to kill the outlaws, the outlaws win by killing the Sheriff, and the renegades want to be the last players alive in the game. Each player also gets a character card with their own special ability.

RATING: 5
I was quite disappointed after playing this game a few times. The social deduction part of the game is almost pointless and so the game is basically just a dice chucker. That being so, I feel like there are way better dice chuckers out there. I would say maybe play something like King of Tokyo over this unless you just really really prefer the western theme.

RATING: 7.5
Brings a very similar feeling as Bang! the card game but plays MUCH faster.  15-20 minutes with six players is doable.  Six players with the card game will probably take an hour or so.

One negative is that it is not as thematic as the card game.  You don't upgrade your weapons or jump on horses, etc.  However, the quickness and getting just enough of the Bang! experience more than makes up for that.  This will make it to the table much more than the card game going forward.

We didn’t play the regular card version of Bang – even though the large bullet case looked tempting. Due to the guys at the Dice Tower going on about this game, we tried it out. It is a pretty easy hidden-goal game to introduce new players. It is quite streamlined in play and plays pretty quick and fun.

Great game, since we all knew Bang! the card game we caught on quickly. At 1st we realized that the initial 1st turn was way different. 

It is a great game but it will not replace the card game. I think the card game is slightly better, probably for a few reasons. One, I prefer board games over card games, I prefer card games over dice games. Two, Bang! the card game is so darn fun in the way I have it tweaked, and especially using all the bling I have. Just sitting and playing the game with family has created fun times and memories, its a blast. Don't get me wrong, we are gonna play the Dice game, we love it, everyone said it doesn't replace the card game (not just me) but is a different fun game.

A distilled edition of Bang!, retaining all the characteristics of the original game, but distilling it down to a frothy, 15 minute package.

Nice art. Nice dice. Plays simple and quick. The strategy may be a little more subtle than I was expecting as well. I have heard several players complain that they don't understand what it is they should be doing. I understand that sentiment, but it is coming from my casual game group (and by "casual" I mean, they don't pay attention to the game while playing).

The theme doesn't shine through as much as I hoped, except for the Indian arrows which I think are awesome! However, it seems that the best chance outlaws have for winning is hoping that the Sheriff takes a lot of hits from the Indians.

May completely replace Bang! (the card game) because this only lasts 20 minutes, and you won't be eliminated before you have a turn.   Probably.   Still retains the Bang! flavor and goals, and functions as a good alternative to King Of Tokyo if you need a break from that.   Probably best with 6-7 players, however.   Below that, it's somewhat dull.

It's BANG!... Dice! Quicker, simpler, faster way to play the game of BANG! I actually enjoy this more because eliminated players don't have to wait long before the next round/game. I heard the expansion(s) are good and actually allow the first eliminated player another chance... I'll have to give it a whirl. Anyway... looking for a quick dice game that goes over well with most people, grab BANG!: The Dice Game!

I didn't feel much tension to keep secrets, but the dice keep things more structured than a pure social deduction game. The character powers introduce ambiguities in the order of executing events, so the game often stops for a rules or FAQ lookup. Players can be eliminated pretty early. Overall I found it very sloppy. Gave away.

1. Fast player elimination is - I suppose - still possible, but requires a bad luck (not only other players' decisions)

3. Dices makes it more exciting in the moments when You're waiting for other players.

Have enjoyed the majority of my plays and like the quick games. The player elimination can be a bit of a bummer in larger games, but you don't have to sit out too long. I find the hidden roles to be a bit thin... it's fairly easy to deduce alliances within a round or two and with the exception of the Renegade, there's not a lot of benefit in bluffing.

A great filler that is always up for some big laughs. In my opinion, much better than the original with cards. Components (especially the custom dice) are top notch, and the game is easy to get and to play. It is so quick that player elimination is hardly a problem. The game only starts shining with five players and more. You can play with less but the experience is just not the same.

While never having played Bang, most people agree that this is the definitive version of Bang.  My play of it was enjoyable being that it's a cheap game, it's quick, and fun.  The only reason I didn't keep this in my collection is the fact that I try to avoid games with player elimination.

This has become my favourite group filler. It lacks the claws of a real hidden role game, and is very luck dependent too. That just makes it more approachable for everyone. It's also very hard for a single player to 'ruin' the experience, you can play around them (compare to something like Resistance, which can be terrible due to one dick player).. And a great theme, well executed. Great especially if playing with unknowns or newbies.

I enjoy this sort of deduction where you try to kill each other slowly as oppose to just outing someone and killing them on the spot (aka Mafia-esque games). Plus, dice.

RATING: 7
Another entry in the line of dice games that seek to offer a portion of the game play experience present in "the other game", but it a faster playing time. This one succeeds, and like most of those others, doesn't completely replace it's bigger brother, but shoehorns its way to the table as a filler that'll give you a taste of a larger experience.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Pros
--Hidden identities mechanism that has players guessing at others’ motives
--Very good play time for a filler
--Easy to teach, so able to get any group going

Cons
--VERY restrictive combat system, potentially eliminating the possibility to hit your desired target at all with higher player counts
--The sheriff goes first.  “I rolled 3 1’s, so I guess I’ll shoot the person to my right, who may or may not be my one and only ally”
--Kiss your hopes of meaningful strategy goodbye

Overall, this is a game you can get tired of very quickly.  Too few choices, too much randomness, and the identities and factions is irrelevant.  There are lots better games to fill into this time slot.

This took everything I liked about Bang (hidden roles, theme, characters) and streamlines it into a faster game that brings eliminated players back into the fray in a reasonable amount of time. This version fills the role I tend to assign to the game, that of a large group opener or filler.

Lots of fun! Great filler, gateway and party game. Played it with different groups of non-gamers and they all just wanted to play it again and again. Works really well as a gateway game and has overtaken [thing=70323]King of Tokyo[/thing]'s spot for this. Having such a sure shot gateway game at your disposal is huge and this is where my rather high rating comes from.

The deduction element is almost nonexistent (unless you play with 7-8 players), but that's more of a bonus than the core of the game. Best with 5-7 players. It's okay with 8, but the player elimination can become more of a nuisance then. It's possible to be eliminated after one or two turns, in extreme cases even before you get a turn and then you have to wait for 15 or so minutes.

RATING: 8
The hype is real on this one!  I was expecting to enjoy Bang! The Dice Game, but not to the extent that I do.

This game avoids the pitfalls of the many social deduction games out there in that it is near impossible to have a system or formula because of the use of dice.  Dice also add the slight odds of a Hail Mary return from near losses and even if you are going to lose, at least you can take others with you!

Bang! The Dice game played ok with four people but I can imagine it be amazing with bigger groups.  Never a dull moment.

Az első néhány játék után leírtam, akárcsak az eredetit, aztán egyszer csak kipróbáltuk heten. Így jött ki a „zamata”! Ez tényleg partijáték, a tipikusan minél többen annál jobb fajta. Ötletesek a karakterlapkák és nagyjából kiegyensúlyozottak is. Azt tapasztaltuk, hogy két seriffhelyettessel a játékban, hét főnél szinte esélytelenek a banditák (esetleg akkor, ha időben felfedik kilétüket egymás előtt). Jó kis játék, gyors, pörgős, kiszúrós, nagyszerű ár/érték aránnyal!

Very smooth and short hidden identity game. It is a good game for filler, key word being filler. It is easy to explain and gets in and out of play quick. I generally really enjoy a game or two, but playing more than that and I just can't wait to die first. This game is highly dependent upon who is playing. I've played games were someone took 5 minutes just to decide to roll again. If you play this game like that I will always shoot you, no matter what. Maybe I'm just being too hipster and growing to dislike games that everyone can't get enough of...so hip.

A pretty enjoyable, stripped-down, quicker-playing version of Bang. It gives me almost all of the tension of the original game in 10 minutes.  The addition of the Indian arrows works really well (a player accumulates arrow tokens when an arrow is rolled on a die, but they don't hurt until all of the arrows have been taken from the central pile, and then they give one point of damage each).

Excellent filler game. Only lasts about 15-20 minutes, so even if you're killed off you don't have to wait too long for the next round. I like all the different roles; almost all the roles are pretty helpful, and because there are so many you can play a few rounds without any repeats. The amount of interaction is great too. Recommended if you need a light, quick game that plays up to 8!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is a great filler game, especially with 5-7 people playing. It rarely takes that long to play, but when you have at least one deputy helping the sheriff there is nice balance between the roles, the characters, the luck of the dice, and the strategy of the game. For a fun game with light strategy this is a great addition to anyone's shelf. There is a significant amount of luck, but since the games are short and the strategy component does make a difference in how the game plays, the luck adds to the fun of the game, rather than detracts from it.

This game truly deserves the rave reviews it's getting. I think it's the perfect filler for 6 or 7 players. The base mechanisms are simple enough for everyone to be able to start playing within a minute and yet the bluffing and double bluffing provides enough depth to keep it interesting. If you have 20 minutes to kill this is what you wan't to be playing.

Great game that is silly fun and strategic mayhem at the same time. We always play 3-4 games at a time. The Sheriff has one of the harder jobs going first since that first turn is almost literally a shot in the dark. I once had the character that turns 1's into 2's and vice versa. And I shot the guy sitting next to me 5 times as my first turn as sheriff. He was dead two turns later. Ended up being my deputy. We all busted up laughing. Including the murdered. Fun. Fast. Western. What more do you want in a party game. Definitely better than its older brother.

It's fun, but I wonder if it will hold up to as much repeat play as its father.  The cards added much needed variance, and in big games, not being able to shoot more than 2 away (in the dice game) is kind of a bummer.

It feels like there should be...I don't know, just a touch more *there* there.  Like maybe the 3x Dynamite needs an event deck where some crazy stuff happens?

Super fun! Played many times, even my parents love it.  For me, it may be a little too streamlined/simple to allow for getting into the role.  At least with the people I play with, it's pretty obvious who is on what side after one or two turns.  This makes it more a unique dice game and less a bluffing team game.  Still, it's hard to argue when so many have enjoyed this one.

One my future mother in law killed me when i was the sheriff, and she was the deputy!  It was great.  The perfect weight for a game for this type of game.

A very fun twist on BANG!, making the gameplay significantly faster than the card game version. It's a lot of fun, especially when you have 5+ players. Unfortunately, if you're playing 2-4 people, it's quite obvious who is who, so concealing identity is fairly difficult, if not impossible. 

If there was a way to make the 3-4 player games more interesting, this could be a much better game, that's for sure.

Rating based on 2, 8-player games.  Too much downtime and it seemed like you might only get 1 or two plays per game before you got out. Seemed like just random decisions being made all the time.  Maybe it was because it was so many people.

Fantastic game that's always popular. Having played the card game version, I appreciate the simplified approach that keeps the whole table engaged while the game moves at a good pace. Not a fan of the player elimination, but I hope the expansion will remedy that.

RATING: 7
Not too shabby! This is a VERY straight-forward game, especially easy to introduce to new-comers to the hobby. It has a lot of interaction, back stabbi---err, backshooting, and a quick deduce the secret role portion. The game plays quick, under 15-20 mins, and you're likely to play more than one round. Lots of characters, press your luck, and it'll play up to 8! Top tier filler. Some low points because there really isn't deep strategy involved.

It's a quick simple game that's just fun. It kind of manages to be a super fast traitor game, but it's usually not long before the roles are obvious. It of course has lots of luck and some of the roles are unbalanced at certain player counts, but it's so fast and carefree that it doesn't matter. The special characters are very important to make the game more interesting and the game plays best with more players.

I have now played this game with lots of different people and have come to really enjoy it. It is a quick game. I would say it is a party game. The first time is slow for people still learning the rules, but it really gets going the more you play. It does have its weak points, some character cards have pointless abilities and you could potentially die before you even get a turn. Despite those weaknesses, it is a great family game or party game, easy to learn, and has lots of replay ability.

Take everything that's awful in Bang, and multiply it. Remove everything that's interesting from Bang. Shake it, throw in some dice a la Yatzhee. That's it. Its only virtue is that it plays itself fast. Otherwise it would be a 1.

Its ok. Its light hearted, some of specifics which are meant to add strategy are easily forgotten. No one says "i gotta play this game!"

 Its what you play while you wait for the rest of your friends to arrive to play your real games. Ive played it a few times with different groups and no one remembered who kills whom to win or really cared. Often devolved into a last man standing gotcha kind of game. Meh. I have a lot of Meh games. I appreciate the effort they spent making it. Ill probably give it away.

I really enjoy Bang! The Dice Game. The hidden role mechanic is cool, but it's hard to win as the sheriff or renegade. The outlaws have a serious edge, and the deputies and renegade have to be very aggressive toward them if they want to have hopes of winning.

RATING: 7
I'm generally not a huge fan of dice-based randomness outside of co-op games, but BANG! feels like it's just doing everything right to make me want to roll. Re-rolls and the risk/reward factor with Dynamite and Arrows is a large part of this I think. The two sets of roles and resulting uniqueness of plays would be the other part, very high replay value.

Larger games can make the player elimination feel really rough, but in smaller games it's usually quick enough not to be a problem.

RATING: 7
Look, it lacks the bite and tension that characterises ‘The Resistance; Avalon’ but we had fun with it for an evening.  It’s better than ‘Werewolf’.  To win as the renegade is more challenging than with the other characters.  Maybe there are subtleties yet to be uncovered.  Whether we discover these will depend on how far Avalon falls out of favour - not likely in the foreseeable future.

Love the dynamic of the opening salvos of the game as players try to figure out who is who. Lots of fun. Grab this game if you have five people or more and five minutes to kill. It's very, very easy to learn and new players are up and running in seconds, literally.

As of rating this (Dec 2015) I have never played the game's parent, the original BANG! card game. But I had played the "Usurper" variant of Magic: The Gathering many times, which is essentially multiplayer Magic with the hidden roles from BANG overlayed.

Bang! The Dice Game is a huge hit with my wife's family, and I think it works perfectly with any group of players from 5 and up to the max. With 3-4 I'd rather play something else, which is the main reason this gets a 7 rather than an 8. 

Really, I'd like to give this a 7.5 if I could.

Többször játszottam a kártyás verzióval, így van összehasonlítási alapom.
Számomra nagy előnye, hogy gyorsan tanulható és maga a játék is gyorsabb. A szerencsefaktor a kockadobások miatt nagyobb.
Ha a Banditák nem kezdik meg a Sheriff-et időben lőni, nincs esélyük. De még így is nagyobb, mint a Renegát(ok)nak.
5 játékos felett van igaz hangulata.

Same basic mechanics and gameplay goals as the original, but dare I say that it's the better game!! The dice rolling brings down the play time a ton and makes you focus more on the allegiances and less on the card play. Only downside is that, with only a few players the teams become obvious a bit more quickly. At this point, I'd play this before the base game on most occasions.

RATING: 8
Bang! The Dice Game does an admirable job of translating Bang! into something quicker playing (which is a plus already) while still maintaining the spirit of the original. As in Bang!, it is possible to die before you even get a turn. As in Bang!, there is much more emphasis on "take-that" than actually figuring out anyone's role. But those aspects seem to fit better in a quicker-playing game like this. Sure, it is possible to crap out on your first roll, and in a game where you may only get a three (or fewer!) turns, this could be viewed as a negative. But it's very easy to hop back into another game as soon as it is finished. 

With the existence of games that do what Bang! is trying to do, but better (such as Shadow Hunters) along with games like this that give you the Bang! experience in a shorter time frame, Bang! may simply be outclassed at this point. Yes, the higher complexity of Bang! gives it more tactical choices, but the trade off for the time it adds is not worthwhile. As surprising as it may seem, I would rather play this game than Bang! itself.

Great game, the more, the merrier. I like a lot this game. The hidden roles are sometimes "easy" to know who is everyone because of the actions but it's not always a guarantee. You may end up shooting your partners without a clue. Quick to play, characters are balanced, easy to learn how to play. The only problem is that sometimes people forgot that their character have an ability and they don't use it.

--------------

Excelente juego, entre más, mejor. En lo particular me gusta mucho este juego. En ocasiones es "fácil" descubrir los roles ocultos de los jugadores basándose en las acciones que toman; sin embargo, no es garantía. Es posible que termines disparándole a los demás miembros de tu equipo sin que te des cuenta. Fácil de jugar, personajes balanceados y fácil de entender. El único problema es que los jugadores en ocasiones olvidan que su personaje posee alguna habilidad y olvidan usarla.

Sadly, this is the most perfect version of the [i]Bang![/i] experience.  

It bums me out because I really love the original card game—the rich narrative that arises from the interplay of various Spaghetti Western tropes, the sheer volume of options and interactions, as well as the physical nod to poker.

But everyone I've played this with—[i]everyone[/i]—says they prefer this to that.  I will admit the designers have done a brilliant job of distilling down the raw experience with very little loss of fidelity; it really does feel like [i]Bang![/i] in less than 15 minutes... but I do miss the cards held close to the vest, the bluffing, the flurry of bangs falling to the table like the fanning of a Colt's hammer.

I've played with 5-8 players and it works well.  Also, it's really easy to teach.  I actually own two copies because people want to borrow it so much.  Still hits the table regularly.

Frequently played at social gatherings because the rules are easy to teach and it's super portable. The hidden teams are conducive to party settings. It can be over very quickly, which isn't necessarily a bad thing.

+Plays quick and up to 8!

-Imbalanced at some player counts
-You can be eliminated before your turn

Very light on the deduction part of social deduction, especially as the bullets fly from the beginning somewhat arbitrarily. A quick filler game, and easy to explain.

Like: The dice-based action system is fun, with some control over the randomness in a risk/reward way. When the teams do appear to emerge, the dynamics around it are interesting.

Dislike: The initial round or so feels very random, and with information only coming through action that's probably a necessity of the game, with the initial round being played around the revealed sheriff role. Not really a fan of player elimination, although it plays out quickly at least.

What would seem like a fun dice chucking hidden roles game is totally destroyed by the meaningless decision to force the Sheriff to reveal himself at the start.  This means that all the other players effectively reveal their identities from their opening actions and the game turns into a simple competition of who rolls the most damage dice first.  The game does play quickly, however and has nice dice so that's something positive.

There are much, much better hidden role games for your money than this one.

When first I researched this game, I only saw it compared to Bang! the Card Game, but I was more concerned that it might be too similar to King of Tokyo. I went ahead and bought it and I'm glad I did. It definitely stands on it's own. The dice work similarly but still feel different. The different starting abilities and hidden roles are a big reason for this. Also, I really enjoy the Indians and gatling gun mechanics.

RATING: 5
Better than the original, BANG! The Dice Game still suffers from some of the same issues its parent game has: early player elimination (particularly bad in larger games), a weak hidden role aspect (there isn't a lot of room for clever bluffing opportunities, especially when playing as a Sheriff or Deputy), and too much randomness (now in the form of dice rolling rather than card drawing). The single improvement - the game plays much, much more quickly - is almost enough to overlook these issues, but for me, there are better games in the hidden role genre than this one.

RATING: 7.5
Light party game.  With the decision being dice-based, the hidden roles may have a lesser impact on game play.  Never, AP is greatly decreased and the parcheesi style dice rolling means you still have a bit of decisions to make in expanding your choices or to have a chance at getting the actions you want.  Faster gameplay still yields a fun time for all.

If you are looking for a fun little filler game for 5-8 players, this is a good choice.

Really needs at least 5 players for the hidden roles to make an impact.

RATING: 1
Terribad. Pointless dice rolling. No push your luck fun factor such as other roll, keep X dice, roll the rest. Just randomly spraying bullets at everyone at the table. No strategy to try and figure out who your teammate is (if you are one of the bad guys) and to slyly coordinate with them like any good traitor game.

The bullets just keep flying and you have no control over who they hit (I guess aiming is not a prerequisite in the land of Bang!). 

When you are not busy rat-tat-tat'ing your gun in random directions, you are getting shot at by unseen indians and fumbling with dynamite that only blows up in your face. The level of incompetency of the characters begs to question why they chose gunslinger for a profession.

One of the characters is immune to gatling gun. Pick that one, you will need it to keep from turning to swiss cheese! That is my only piece of strategy for you.

From a thematic standpoint, I could MAYBE buy into this if it were revolutionary era since muskets and what not were inaccurate and sprayed ammo all over. Bang 1776 would have been more fun a theme then just another wild west send off.

There is no game here. Stick with the original card game, if you must.

MUCH better than regular Bang!, but still falls short of a keeper game for me. Bang! The Dice game is very fast paced at that is its main advantage, however I still feel some downtime for such a simple game. 

The dice are gorgeous and the components very good, however the game is way too light for my current tastes and it still can drag. It has even more luck than regular Bang! 

Bottom line, the best Bang! variation I have ever played but not enough to appeal to me. I already sold my copy of the game but I would play it if requested. If you like regular Bang! You will probably like this edition, both games are very similar. With more plays, I guess the rating will go down.

Current Rating: 5.0

Not sure what it brings to the table versus other hidden team games.  On top of it. The wild swings of damage make it possible to kill in one or two turns.  On the other hands, plinking for 1 or 2 damage is often negated by healing rolls.  Tedious at best....

(2014-06-17) I've only played this once so far, but I already feel confident in saying that it is a big improvement over the original. I would also compare it favorably to King of Tokyo, as it uses a similar mechanism, but there's a little more going on. Fun dice game, I look forward to playing it more.

Update: I've played Bang! The Dice Game quite a few times now, and it's still an improvement over the original game. It plays faster while still having all of the better elements. It can still run a little long for my tastes, though.

I liked Bang, but was never in love with it. The dice game however, is fantastic. You get the flavour of hidden roles and unique player powers in a package that doesn't overstay its welcome.

As it is, it's easy to crank out a couple of quick games in a half an hour - spectacular filler.

Easy to learn and play dice rolling/social deduction game. The social deduction element isn't too significant, but some games it comes out more. Can end up in an awkward situation with two players at the end hoping for luckier dice rolls.

I honestly can't decide whether if this or BANG! is better. The game is simple, and play fast. However, the hidden identity mechanic is very meaningless other than giving you a direction in the game. You're essentially playing on auto-pilot, hoping you roll the right icon at the right time.

I would say I've had more fun at times playing the card version than the dice version (partly because i have played it more), but the dice version streamlines the game, making it quicker and easier to teach. It makes it more of a filler game, which I like. This gets me my Bang fix in a shorter amount of time. Plus there's nothing like rolling a bunch of dice.

I usually dislike Take That, Yathzee-clones, and social deduction, so I don't know exactly why I give this one a pass. Very quick, and doesn't really delve into pointless and endless "is-he-or-ain't-he" like many other social deduction/traitor games do. Further play might make me realize what about it makes me enjoy the game while I hate every single aspect of it.

I really adore this game for many reasons.
Before i got into boardgames i already played a lot of Bang! but was put off by its long downtime/playtime and early player elimination.
Bang: The Dice Game solved this problems by providing a very similar feeling of the original Bang! but in a much smaller time period.
It is easy to teach and the combination of dice chucking and deduction is perfect.

The game is quite fun. Rolling the dice is satisfying and at the start of the game you don't know who to trust but as the game goes on you start to form little alliances even if you are on the opposite teams (Renegade is the role that does this the most). I quite like the game and I see myself playing it many times in the future.

A light and fun filler game that's very easy to teach and entertaining for most parties at the table. Games are usually short given that most players will die based on the randomness of the dice rolls. Most games are not long enough for politics to come into play too much, but it doesn't detract from the fun.

THIS is the true party game. Bang! dice game improves on the card game in so many ways.

Turns are Shorter since dice are rolled
Iconography are limited resulting in ease of play for casual players.
Since dice is open to view, veterans can help new players as they play.

ITS the best and I will possibly NEVER play original bang! again!

On the positive side, the game is easy to each and easy to play. Kids like shooting at each other.

Captures the essence of the card game and simplifies it, in a good way, streamlining the experience. Everything that worked in the original is here, what didn't has been removed. Thematic, fun, fast and easy to teach.

For those unfamiliar with the card game, it's got some bluffing along with a strong push-your-luck component. Rounds are fast and furious, and it has a built-in timer which prevents it from dragging. It's also very easy to teach, as players will grasp how it works with minor explanations, just requiring watching a couple veterans play their turns. Great conflict-heavy dice game.

Great party game. Has only been played twice in one evening but to huge success. Will definitely play again.

UPDATE JULY 2015: This has become the second-most-played party game (behind The Resistance, of course). I find that I'm growing tired of it, though, as each time I play it it's with a new group who has never played it before. Roles are understood, but not acted on and most players play very passively. Once I start to play it with returning players who understand how crucial bluffing is in the game, I may begin to enjoy it more.

05-05-2014 - So sad.  I thought this was going to be a ... "blast".  :-/  Anyway, I feel like something is missing.  I'm not sure what or how you would fix it.  It just seems like 3/4 of a game to me that's not as fun as the hype might suggest.  It was still ok though and I'm sure I'll pull it out again.  The fact that it plays so quickly is probably its only saving grace.  Not a huge fan.

Very similar to King of Tokyo in terms of mechanics. The only difference is the variable player powers and hidden roles instead of upgrade cards in King of Tokyo.

[House Rule] Deal 2 character cards per person (choose 1, discard 1) so players can have some choice.

I think the Renegade win condition should be eliminating the Sheriff after all Outlaws and other Renegades are eliminated... regardless of whether Deputies have been eliminated.  Last-player-standing requirement is too difficult.

Minor quibble: wish the cards and rules would replace "Indians" verbage with "arrows"

Player elimination is still a bummer, but the game running shorter than the card version helps some.

Bang! The Dice Game keeps the core of the Bang! card game in place. At the start of the game, players each take a role card that secretly places them on a team: the Sheriff and deputies, outlaws, and renegades. The Sheriff and deputies need to kill the outlaws, the outlaws win by killing the Sheriff, and the renegades want to be the last players alive in the game.

I find this better then the card game BANG, and think it will replace it.

I am not a fan of the original [gameid=3955], but I must say this one takes that overall game and reduces it to something sleek and pretty fun. Whereas the original game seemed to be more complicated than was necessary, this one seems to be exactly what it should be. Its almost as if the game has been reborn into a truer form. Granted, I am rather partial to Yahtzee style dice games. I would definitely not mind playing this one a few more times to see how much depth is in the game.

If only it wasn't as random, then it would be one of the best games ever.

still, a really good party game with fun rolls and my favorite dice in any game--maybe tied with King of Tokyo.

I guess the little cardboard tokens for arrows and bullets for health could have been better.  Love the character cards though.

There's chaos to not knowing who's out there.  It's also clearly unbalanced for the renegades.

Great pace and action.  A fast game, and everyone had a great time with it.  It will take a few more plays to figure out the best way to use the character traits.  I probably wouldn't play this with less than 5 people, but for a game with 5-8 players, it's good fun.  I also like, but do not own, the card game.  I think I like the dice game better.

At 4 is a bit boring.
At 6 it gets better but the sheriff and deputy will have a very hard time.
At 8 is the best. We had so much fun and laughed alot.

Very quick game, it does lose some of the theme that the card game have. If I had the time I would still go with the card game.

This works great over lunch at work. Get people into it, it's not long, and easy to teach non-gamers.

Feels a little too random to ever make good deductive choices. People also seem to just roll the dice, and attack random people with very little deduction. The player elimination also hurts the game given it can go for longer than I'm happy with.

While I like this game more than regular Bang, as it shortens a rather light game that especially with non gamers overstays its welcome, the dice abstracts the theme too much for me, as it is basically you lose 1 life and you lose 1 life and I gain 1 life every turn rather than feeling like you were actually shot (I understand why the health totals are so high because then this game would be even more of a luckfest than it already is as someone could be burst down quickly, but it isn't good thematically). The gatling gun seems underpowered unless you are out of range to target who you want and some other niche scenarios. I do like the arrow mechanic though. The dynamite can be terrible if you just get horribly unlucky.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
There are two references you will hear almost every time you play: banging innuendos and "I shot the Sheriff but I didn't shoot the Deputy". This is a more compact version of Bang! that introduces a different kind of randomness by using dice instead of cards.

In this game, there are three teams: the good guys, the bad guys, and the renegade. The Sheriff is known, and he might have some deputies helping him out; they're trying to kill everyone else. The Outlaws just want to kill the Sheriff, and the Renegade wants to make it to a 1v1 with the Sheriff and then kill him. On your turn, you roll the 5 dice. On a 1 or a 2, you shoot people that far a way. On a beer, you regain health. An arrow makes you take an arrow from the center, which is basically delayed damage. Three gears, and you shoot everyone else for 1 and get to put back your arrows. Three dynamite, and you blow up, losing 1 health and ending your turn. You can reroll up to 3 times (though dynamite can't be rerolled). Everyone has a special ability, ranging from "you can use 1s and 2s and 2s as 1s" to "beers count double if you have less than 4 health".

RATING: 8
After one session, I'm ready to replace my copy of Bang with this one. B!tDG is recognizably Bang in atmosphere, but avoids several of the shortcomings of the original:

- No more interminable turns. None of that Stagecoach-General Store-Stagecoach-General Store thing.
- No Missed action. That sounds like a major loss, given how important they are in Bang, but the key is that B!tDG ends up hitting players far more quickly than they can drink beer to recoup health. End-of-game two-player deadlocks are avoided.
- Mandatory shooting with limited targeting. From turn one, everybody starts shooting, improving the pace of the game.

In larger tables, it's easy for someone at the back of the turn order to die before getting a turn, but this was an issue in Bang, too. The shorter game time for B!tDG helps mitigate this.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Improves over Bang! by taking the pressure off of players who don't like role-playing or being lied to, because every turn you are going to be shooting *someone* in range, no matter who you think they are. In general the dice make it much less stressful, because you can't always control the outcome. The role reveal at the end is often hilarious.

RATING: 8
Each player is given a secret role where you are an outlaw, Sheriff and Deputies or Renegade.  Depending on the number of players winning can be a little odd.  Roll 5 dice up to 3 times.  If you roll dynamite you cannot reroll those and if you roll at least 3 your turn ends.  You can attack players 1-2 spaces away from you.  Or you can roll 3 gatling guns and have everyone lose a point.  If you roll arrows you take on of the 9 in the center.  Once they are all gone, all players take that much damage.  There are personality cards with special abilities and you starting health.  

Overall this is fast playing version of Bang.  It is very simple compared to Samurai Sword which is actually a good game.  But it is longer.  But the social deduction is there as well.

Game got better with repeated plays.  Good game, with good mechanics.  Curious to try again the card game (which I played about 15 years ago and have forgotten) and see how it compares.  Was disappointed to get the impression that there is little room for bluffing.  Open dice rolling, limited actions.  Roles become fairly apparent fairly soon, but this perhaps might change as one becomes more familiar with game mechanics (Hoping there may be more ways to play that don't immediately reveal roles but not sure how that would be possible).

It's like really fast Yahtzee, if Yahtzee was like a shoot-out in the Wild West. The Sheriff and Deputies want to kill the Outlaws and Renegades, the Outlaws want to kill the Sheriff, the Renegades each want to be the last man standing, and the indians want to kill everyone. Thing is, everyone's roles are hidden except for the Sheriff, so everyone knows who the Sheriff is, but no one knows what team everyone else is on.

A social deduction game with Yahtzee like mechanics.  I find this game far more enjoyable than King of Tokyo with its mechanics because it's straightforward.  It can easily play with 8 people with not much downtime, plus it keeps the players engaged since you want to observe everyone's actions.

There is player elimination, but due to the short playtime, it is not much of an issue.

My only problem with the game is it can tire itself rather quickly.  There aren't many interesting decisions to make as the game is either "Attack another player" or "Heal"

This is a fast-playing, fun little dice rolling and bluffing game.  In it, players get special powers and secret identities.  On top of that everyone has different win conditions:  The Sheriff (the only known character) and the deputies want to kill off the outlaws, the outlaws want to kill the Sheriff, and the renegade wants to outlive them all!

It's great fun, and the short playing time means that if you're out early it won't be very long until the next game gets going!

Constantly engaging and almost never suffers from wasted turns, a must have for long time gamers and newcomers alike.

3p isn't very interesting.  The game really should be 4p+, and the more the merrier.  It plays fast which is great, but the hidden role element is pretty weak.  Within a few turns of starting the game the roles are basically all out in the open and it's a chaotic dice-rolling gun fight to see who is the last standing.  Not a lot to it but I can see it being a fun filler for a big group.

02/24/15 Played three four-player games, 9 to 14 minutes each. 
I'd played Bang! (the card game) in 2003 and was not a fan, rating it a "5" here on BGG. All the Italian text and the non-intuitive icons put me off. 

This dice version is better, quicker, and more fun. The components are good, and the player aid was sufficient.

RATING: 8
This is a fun dice-chucking game, it can easily be compared to King of Tokyo. I've never played the origional Bang! so I can't compare it. All I know is that when Bang! is mentioned most people grown, this game is apparently nothing like the origional except in name only.

This is a terrific social game.  There is a small element of social deduction, but mostly this is a party style game with some teasing, banter, light smack talk, and laughs.  It can be pretty random, but there are just enough decisions to make you feel like you have good agency.  It often comes down to a roll off between 2 players, which is thematic and fun.

So long as people understand that this is a team game, and they understand that healing others is often more important than healing yourself, this game usually goes over tremendously.  I have seen it falter once, so it is slightly group dependent.

Also, it's really best with 5 to 6 players.  4 and 7 work.  3 is to be avoided and 8 isn't great, though much better than 3.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
A huge improvement over Bang! Replacing the card system with dice streamlines the whole process and allows players to focus more on the diplomacy of trying to convince the Sheriff everyone is the Deputy. "I'm the Deputy!" has almost become an in-joke for my group in other games with traitor or deceptive mechanics.

BANG! The Dice Game is one of my favorite hidden-role games. It's quick, its easy to learn, and it always energizes the crowd. I love making blind accusations, defending myself against blind accusations, and blindly attacking other players which often leads to outbursts. It doesn't drag on too long, so although it does have player elimination, the game ends quickly enough so that it does not bother anyone playing. This game is definitely a keeper.

A fun game where you're always trying to find out who the other players are, whether they're you rallies, enemies or none at all. This makes the game a lot of fun and its relatively short duration adds to the fun so that you spend a big part of the game finding out who the other players are. At the beginning some players randomly shoot each other while others tend to give away their  identity immediately - or bluff and seem like being a sheriff's assistant while actually being a bandit. There are tons of ways to play this game so that it never seems to get old.

This is everything I wanted Bang! to be, except so much more streamlined, exciting, and fast. It's easy to finish as game of Bang! The Dice Game (BTDG) and immediately start up another one. It's true that BTGC is not particularly deep, but I feel that one of BTGC's greatest strengths is its simplicity. The secret goals and slight uncertainty of the dice rolls give it all the excitement that it needs to be a hit with just about ANY crowd at just about ANY game night, family night, or social gathering in general. Also a great lunchtime-at-work game.

Első alkalommal is és azóta is mindig több (4-5) partit lenyomunk egymás után (egy menet kb 10-15 perc). A szerepek is tök jók, és mivel rögtön jön egy új játék, nagyon élvezetes mindig új speckó képességeket használni. A kockák szerelmeseinek erősen ajánlott!

This is a pretty cool hidden roles game with variable character powers that are truly meaningful and differentiated as to how they impact gameplay.  

There's some serious luck in the die rolling, but the powers allow approached to mitigate that luck.  Still, if you roll poorly, you'll probably lose.  But at 15 minutes, who cares?

This is a good filler that supports up to 8.  I'm not sold on the low-end player counts.  I think 5+ would be best and we've only played with 4 players to-date.

The 3 player variant doesn't really interest me as the roles are essentially known at the start as everyone is gunning for only one other person.

This game is like taking Bang the card game and putting it on fast speed. My first game ended in one round!
To me, a player elimination game has to run quickly to avoid players sitting around waiting for the game to end once they have been eliminated. Bang the dice game delivers in this respect. There is still enough going on that you need to think carefully if you will re-roll dice and which ones are worth the risk.
TREMENDOUS FUN!

RATING: 7.5
Another card game that tries to distill the original version down into a dice format.

Here it is done pretty well. The players are still using hidden roles and trying to figure out who is who. 

It does it all pretty well and the Indian attack mechanic introduces a 'push your luck' element. It is much easier to be eliminated in this version because range is easier to attain for players only 1 and 2 spots away. 

The main negative is that a handful of dice can't replicate the variety of cards in the base game so there is less variety. 

The main plus is that this version offers about 75-80% of what the card game does but it can do it in about 10-15 minutes...so it is very time friendly.

Overall a nice production.

This game is a blast to play with a group of 5+. 4 is fun, and 3 is boring. If you have enough players though, this game is a winner. Of course it's a lot of luck in the dice rolling, but for a party game I don't think that's a bad thing. You also get the chance to re-roll your dice you don't like (for the most part) and I love the bluffing game that goes on during the rounds. Great game that I'd never turn down to play.

I am not enthusiastic about this game, but rolling dice is fun, and deduction is fun as well! Plus, seeing the indians come and wrech everybody's life points is great. 

I'd suggest you only play with large groups, since with 4 the game is too easy in my opinion. But then the little problem is that you don't get to roll dice as much as you'd like to!

Based on the card game, everyone is dealt a secret role (deputy, renegade, outlaw and sheriff). Players are also dealt a character card with special ability. Players then roll 5 dice, Yahtzee style. The symbols on the dice are : arrow, 1, 2, gatling, beer, dynamite. The arrows mean you take an arrow, and when all arrows are gone from supply everyone takes that damage in arrows. The 1, 2 means you deal 1 damage in the direction of your choice. The gatling symbol only works if there are 3 of them, you deal 1 damage to everyone else and get rid of your arrows. The dynamite locks the dice (no reroll) while a beer restores a hit points. 

It's an okay filler. It plays better with some numbers than others. For instance, 4 players has less variety, since a 2 means you always shoot the same person and it is pretty easy to figure out the roles. Fun and quick, if you are in the mood.

What an exquisite dice game! I LOVE action dice system (like pandemic the cure or war of the ring) where you stil have a choice with HOW You use each die but each die has a TYPE of action you can do it with. Combine that with a push your luck element (like pandemic the cure) and coupled with the fact that it gets rid of the slow (but still good but too slow/sluggish) analysis paralysis that comes from hand management and slow turn taking that you get with pandemic original as well as Samurai Sword, you have a fast paced fun but still strategically deep hidden identity game. More like shadow hunters of course in terms of figuring out whose on whose team instead of "we are theoretically coop but someone is a traitor" like in Battlestar gallactica or Shadows over Camelot. This is a great intro, fillter, and light dice game that covers the niche of hidden teams/identities in an interesting way and to me, coupled with the fact that I have Samurai Sword, Shadow Hunters, Coven, Dark Moon, Resistance Avalon, One Night Werewolf, Shadows over Camelot, and possibly a couple others, the original Bang is left completely obsolete and there's no need to play it furhter (despite its virtues)

RATING: 5.5
I feel like I really don't understand what other people see in this game.

The dice make bluffing really difficult seeing as everyone can see the choices you make as you make them, and shooting someone who is on your team causes so many problems it's not worth doing, so who is who becomes obvious really fast. Then it's just whoever rolls best wins... now I don't expect the depths of strategy or anything but this just seems entirely brainless.

I'd take King of Tokyo is a much better dice game, and Resistance is a much better hidden role bluffing game, and Love Letter if you want something brainlessly light, so I can't understand wanting to play this if you have any of those to choose from.

It's quick I guess at least.

Play 3-player. Light, quick to play game - about 20 minutes.  Originally an 8. Now a 7, nearly a 6, because I constantly can't remember who I am attacking, I'm more of a fan of clockwise or anti-clockwise play.  The game is good and dice are fun with a different game twist with the card dealt to you.  Our 6-year old son finds it fun.

RATING: 7.1
Fun, short hidden role - it feels like a shortened mix of King of Tokyo, Shadow Hunters and Resistance kind of. That said, I'd say the game isn't well balanced since some roles are just better than others IMO. Its a pretty enjoyable filler/party at 5-8P ish, but I really wish there wasn't player elimination (I'm just very much against that, even if its short). Overall, I'd rather play this than Shadow Hunters, but given the choice, I'd play One Night Ultimate Werewolf from 4-7P and maybe Blood Bound at 7-10P than Bang! The Dice Game.

I also dislike the mandatory shooting at, say, 2 distance away. I was in a 4P game where my partner was 2 seats away, so every 2, I shot him, despite not wanting to. Perhaps I missed a rule about this? If so, please let me know!

Still, overall decent though the player elimination makes me dislike it a bit.

Character powers are really cool and make you feel special.

Rolling dice a la KOT is fun too.

Giving it a lower rating due to not being great with 2 players.

I think a stack of ability cards or extra dice or weapons would be a cool addition in an expansion. Such as adding a loot die if you roll a combination of dice and drawing a loot or ability card. Just my two cents.

Never played the original card game (reviews I've read seem to agree that this is superior to it), but this is a fun and fast yahtzee-style game.

Really lame, exceptionally stupid, but at least it's simpler to explain than Bang! (no it isn't), induces less AP than Bang! (no it doesn't), and takes less time than Bang! (bingo). I'd almost rather play Bang!, except that this one takes a fraction of the time, and therefore of the boredom-torture (but that fraction might still be greater than ½--ymmv).

Contrary to other dice game conversions, BANG The Dice Game not only keeps the theme, but also the spirit of the card game. It also features the "take that" spirit of the game, but no it's fast and furious, there is no player elimination and most important, it's fun. Rolling dice, deciding what to keep and what to reroll is more fun than drawing a card.

The only drawback is that the hidden roles use to become evident quite soon (not always). That was also the case of the card game, so it's all improvements for me.

Said by a BANG hater.

Certainly I'd rather play this than most other social deduction games.

I really liked this implementation. I enjoy these type of re-roll games, with their cheer and groan factor, and the concept of secret teams works much better in this quicker format, doing away with the rather labored (and still random) card game. I mean if you're going to hit people semi-randomly until teams become clearer, you want to do it in quick format, not long format. It captures the essence of the theme, a shootout. There's no defense, so die on your feet like a man. I'd rate it higher, except I have my suspicions that too many games will be hurt by hitting the wrong people accidently, but it still screams out potential for fun regardless.

RATING: 7
Very basic at lower player counts and definitely much quicker than the original card game. The expansion is supposed to add something to partially fix player elimination and add more characters, so looking forward to that. This captures the spirit of Bang, though I didn't like it as much because sometimes you want a showdown that lasts more than a few turns just to add suspense.

Based on one play: Similar to Bang! yet you roll dice to determine who you can attach and whether you get life. I'm not a fan of Bang! and this was quite similar just replacing cards for dice. You get a role and based on your role you must kill off another group but since the roles are hidden you must first find out who is who which is really easy. So it just becomes random dice rolls.

This is a very fun, fast-paced, quick dice game that can be pretty addictive with the right group. This is an easy game to teach gamers and non-gamers alike, it could be used to introduce the hidden identity mechanic, it also has character special ability and is a lot of fun. For a quick dice game they really added a fun, unique feel by adding in the mechanics they chose I would recommend picking this up to include in your game night. GREAT choice to start a game night or to play in between two longer games.

I have never played the conventional version of Bang, but this game is just as insipid as I had always imagined that game to be. A game of secret roles where the secret is about as difficult to figure out as a four-piece jigsaw puzzle if people play logically or utterly impossible if they don't, this game consists of people rolling dice until everyone dies (of boredom). It's like shadow Hunters if you took out all the cool victory/loss conditions and replaced them with an ill-conceived alliance system and brain dead dice play. The sole bright spot here is that you can have the Indians fill you up with arrows really fast and then not have to take any more turns.

Colt Express replaced this game for our Cowboy fix.

Lots of fun for the kids. Really tough to win as the Renegade. I think this works best with 5 players so that you can shoot any other player if you role a 1 and a 2.

This plays very quickly, which is nice. Sometimes you can get eliminated before you even get a second roll of the dice, which is not so good.

This comes in a small box. I bring this to the cafe to entertain the children while my wife and I finish our coffee.

great game. Hidden roles, special powers and take that in 15 minutes? That's a definite win.

edit: After a lot of plays it feels a little bit too randomn. Even for a dice game. I still enjoy it, but if I want to play a hidden role game, I'd rather play something different. If I want to play a dice game, I'd rather play something different.

Bought this for the 2015 Christmas party.

Played 2 rounds of this at the Xmas party.
While it is true that this gives the same feel as Bang with less downtime due to mechanical improvements to the game, the feeling stays the same. If you've played Bang to death, this probably is a skip for you. I sure had my share of Bang on my iOS phone. The game was fun for the first few weeks and then it dropped off hard.

This game reproduces the same feeling as the card version, only it is faster.

Bang the dice game is an interesting take on Bang the card game. In a lot of ways, it's actually probably better than Bang the card game -- Bang the card game took a bit too long to play, and had player elimination... at least the dice game is quick! This really just does everything Bang does, but better and quicker

This game comes out all the time at work. I play about 6 times/week. I've illustrated some new role cards. The game is fast, fun, easy for new players, has emotional highs and lows, and is extra rewarding when the renegade pulls out a win. The hidden role/deduction aspect makes every game exciting. For 7 players, I've considered shuffling the deputy and renegade cards and randomly selecting 3 to mix things up a bit.

New Roles:
Calvin Costmore: (8) can shoot arrows or bullets
Bones the Mystic: (8) can change the face of a die by sacrificing another die (dynamite cannot be flipped, if 3+ dynamite, those die may not be sacrificed)
Generous George: (10) can give half his life rounded down, to another player
Salacious Sandy: (8) can block an opponent's ability for one round
Cross Dressing Bob: (7) at the beginning of each turn, select an opponent's ability to copy
Straight Laced Sally: (9) end your turn with no duplicate die to regain full health - lose the effect of all die rolled
Crazy Jeremy: (9) roll 3 dynamite, all players, including yourself, take 1 damage
Frank the Mercenary: (8) lose a life point to shoot any opponent with an arrow
Demon Dan: (9) at the beginning of each turn, you may select the ability of a dead player to use
The Horse: (8) ignore the first damage dealt to you directly (excludes Gatling gun)
Nancy the Necromancer: (8) at the beginning of your turn, you may resurrect a deceased player to one health
The Leech: (7) at the beginning of your turn, you may take one life point from another player
Kingmaker: (7) you may kill yourself and any other player other than the sheriff
Loudmouth Larry: (8) you may see the secret role of an opponent, but must disclose your role to do so

Dependent on the players, this can be good fun; especially if a little incompetence creeps in. It is - yes, I know it's a dice game - very dependent on what you roll, so even if you play the social deduction side of it well, you may still not have a chance. But it's short, too, so just play it again!

RATING: 7
This is a cute and quick playing hidden role game where sometimes you get arrowed to death by your own rolls. Each role has slightly different victory conditions, which can lead to some bluffing. The different player powers give the game good replayability. The general idea is, you roll the dice and then decide where to spread the damage. One player has the role of sheriff, and they are known to everyone. One player is secretly the deputy who wins if he and the sheriff both live. Two players are outlaws who want to kill the sheriff. One player is the renegade, who only wins if he is the last man standing. When you roll arrows, you collect tokens and when the tokens run out, everyone takes damage equal to the arrows they took. This functions as the press your luck element, discouraging people from using all their rerolls. The game CAN be rumpus fun trying to figure out who is who, and stay alive... with a group that is up for it. I've had some groups love this to death and others absolutely hate it. I'm never completely clear why, or who will take a liking to it.

A great, fast dice game with some light deduction and hidden roles. It's a lot of fun both for people who are very familiar with games and people who have never played any modern games before. It's always well received at parties and people usually ask to play again when the first round is over. It does have player elimination, but it's fast enough that it's not too big of a problem.

Player count note: It's not great at four, and three is ok but feels like a different game without the hidden roles. Five or more is where it really works. There's also a 2-player shootout variant on the BGG forums that is pretty good.

So I used to like and enjoy Bang! But as I got into gaming more and played many more games, I began to see more and more flaws. The dice version though manages to make me love the game once more. They fixed practically everything--the game now plays quickly instead of dragging, player elimination is bearable now since rounds are 5-10 minutes, and they still kept the hidden roles and shooting other players that make the game so fun. 

It's still a light game with limited decisions and bad rolls can occasionally screw you, but overall Bang! The Dice Game produces some high tension and fun as the outlaws try to gun down the Sheriff, the deputies try to earn the Sheriff's trust, and the sly Renegade is always watching out for himself. I'll gladly play this as a quick and easy dice game or hidden role game.

Another game with hidden roles, Everyone knows who the Sheriff in town is, but there are outlaws and renegades all around, and there may be a deputy out there helping enforce the law.

Why oh why it doesn't play well enough with four?! That's the player count we play most often and with four, it's only ok. Adding just one player more (deputy sheriff) bumps it to 8 for us, four players is closer to 6, so a 7 as the final rating seems fair. 

For me, this one surpasses Bang! The Bullet card game. It's a lot quicker, so it works better as a filler (and playing a handful of games doesn't take an entire evening). If you're out of the game early, no biggie - it will end soon anyway. Lots of dice chucking (love dice), fun and interesting special powers, simple rules... Works very well with newcomers, but experienced gamers will also enjoy it after a long gaming session, to finish the evening with a bit of laughter.

If BANG! the card game isn't appealing or fun, then the dice game is the one to play. It plays much quicker than the card version which is the big plus. The variable player powers are mostly good and add a nice element to the game. The deduction is all but gone as you are simply rolling dice but this also removes analysis paralysis from the game. The press your luck feature can create some real fun moments and the games typically do not exceed 20 minutes so even if you have a run of bad rolls, you will not be sitting out for long.

Player elimination + Dice = Hard Pass for Me

I really want to like this game because it has a nice theme and allows plenty of interaction, simple deception and gunfights!

The problem is that there's almost no tactical play and the strategic choice you make is quite arbitrary. Your only key decision is whether you want to create confusion by sometimes shooting at your (secret) allies, or whether you instead want to shoot only at your main foe(s). Depending on what others chose, you may not know who your friends/foes are for a while.

The result is a fairly pointless pea-soup of people rolling dice and allocating the resulting damage to each other. But it's still a bit of fun guessing who's friend or foe and finding you've been harming the wrong people etc.

The renegade character has a slightly more challenging role (they only win if they are the last person alive apart from the sheriff, then kill them). But even their gameplay will be pretty basic.

I'm keeping it for now just because it a fairly quick knockabout game where you get to choose roles, so has a niche.

I think this is a better option than the card game and I like the idea overall but I think there are a couple things that hinder it:

1) It has a short play time. This is a blessing and a curse. It's great because the game lasts about as long as a game like this should but we have also had too many instances of people getting killed or only having one turn before getting killed. Since the game is so short, it's not the end of the world but it definitely can bring down the enjoyment factor.

2) It's certainly more random, as one might expect with using dice rolls each turn. Once again, I think this trade-off is worth it to keep the play time lower but I did miss the option to set up my deck for a future turn by managing my hand in the card game. The dice game is more of a "do whatever I can in the moment and hope for the best before my turn comes around" affair. The card game had this as well, just not as much.

3) This is a very minor gripe and it goes away once everyone at the table understands the game but why don't they put the role's objective on the role cards? There is plenty of space so why not just say on the renegade card that your winning condition is to be the last man standing? It seems I am inevitably playing a game like this with new players so this would help.

4.14.14 This is a great addition to the base Bang! game. In ways, it's a bit better than the card game. The only downside is if you don't like the randomness of dice rolls. 
Played with four and it seems the Sheriff had a hard time living and wins rarely. Played with 6 players and it added a lot to the game, but the sheriff won most of the games. Still, I want to play this game each time and I do enjoy. Initial rating of 7. I'll give it some time and plays and see if that goes up or down.
5.27.14 Played this at my Ron-CON and the game really shined. Had some great games and I have bumped up my score to 7.5

10.12.14 I have raised my rating a full point to 8.5 this game has seen consistent table play and I think it will continue in the future.

VASTLY better than the original bang, but that is saying little from my point of view.  There is still player elimination, but the game is shorter so it doesn't matter much.  There is a lot of luck, but the game is short.  While the randomness of the dice doesn't bother me too much, the lack of choices does.  There is an illusion of choice with the rerolls, but mostly you are stuck doing whatever the dice tell you.

The game claims to work with small player counts, but I think it really falls flat 4, and I wouldn't go near the 3 player variant.  With 4, the game is almost pure mindless luck, since 2 of the players are just out for themselves, and the social deduction element is almost entirely absent.

So, I am holding out hope that the game works will with more players, but I'm losing confidence with every play.

15-03-2014. Downgraded back to 7 after another 6 plays. I like it, it's better than King of Tokyo with 5-6 for sure, but it misses part of the deduction from the original Bang.

14-01-2014. Upgraded rating to 8 after another 3 games with 5 people (of which 2 new players). This time, there was more thinking and guessing. I actually played as sheriff and was puzzled to choose between my deputy and a renegade. I chose correctly and blasted that renegade to dust. So, the game actually gets better and my initial worry of too much randomness is alleviated a little!

02-01-2014. Rated 7 after playing the game 3 times with the same group of 5 people.  

I like the game, compared to the old Bang! this games takes significantly less time, which is good since the old one took too much time.

Downside of the new dice mechanic for me is that the thinking aspect of the original Bang! did not appear in several of the games I played of the dice game. The arrows damaged everyone heavily, so the time for deduction was limited and the game might have been over too fast in our first 2 games. It worked fairly well in the last game.

RATING: 7
I think the original Bang! (the card game) is fantastic; however, this to me has become superior for my group. The classic version of Bang! creates some interesting strategy and combos based off of the number health points and cards you may have; it should be stated that there are a variety of modifiers for your character and weapons too. The dice version does not have any mechanic that works this way, but Bang! The Dice Game clears out a lot of fluff and keeps the core mechanics in tact. The games go fairly quickly and prevents downtime for players who are killed off in the game. The dice rolling mechanic is like Kings of New York/Tokyo and Yahtzee. The symbols are much easier to understand/explain to newer players as well. This truly makes Bang! The Dice Game a great party game. If you are looking for more content (expansions) and mechanics the original Bang! will be the better choice.

Na itt ez nem fordul elo... adva van egy poros utca, ahol 3-8 marcona alak pisztolyt rant! Csak a sheriff kilete a biztos, a tobbiek szandekait majd abbol lehet kifurkeszni, merre lonek! Minden karaktertipusnak mas a celja, de modszer azonos. Egy marek kocka eldobasa, ketszeri ujradobas, majd az eredmeny vegrehajtasa. Lovessel csak a melletunk, vagy az egyel arrebb ulore vagyunk veszelyesek (persze ahogy kiesnek a jatekosok, szukul a kor, vegul mindenki lo mindenkire!), kiveve, ha beulunk a gatling moge, es vegigrotaljuk az egesz placcot. A dinamitra figyelni kell, mert alank robbanhat, raadasul idonkent az indianok is megbatorodnak es tuparnava valtoztatjak a jatekosokat!

A titkos karakteres jatekok minden izgalma megvan ebben a kis dobozban, de konnyedebben es rovidebb ido alatt! Egy jatek csak 10-20 perc, igy idealis filler! Persze a gyorsasag nem mindig elony - van, hogy mire leadnad a jeleidet a feltetelezett tarsadnak, az mar halomra lott teged is! :D

I just haven't been able to get into this one.  Yes, it plays faster than the original Bang!, which is a good thing, but it's missing the tension that the original game provided.  I'm also irked that you can give beer to any player to heal them.  In several games, the deputies team was able to win by constantly healing the sheriff with beer--something that couldn't have happened in the original game.

It's okay, but it's a bit too random to control your own fate and a bit too long to not care. At least so far -- really need to play it more. I want the expansion to hopefully fix these problems.

A huge improvement upon the original card game in so many ways. Mainly a faster game means less waiting around for knocked out players. The 20 characters add some welcome spice to proceedings. I'd still rather play Coup up to five or six players, but Bang! The Dice Game provides a viable 10 minute opener for ideally five to eight players. Rolling dice is after a fun activity in a light game and this is just the right weight for dice.

Pros:
- hidden characters are an excellent mechanism to many games but here it turns up in a small quick game, which is unusual and very nice 
- the game goes with almost any person and age group. Hey Grandpa, you like those Charles Bronson movies? Sit down, I got to show you something...
- taught in ten minutes, fun for hours
- we usually use it to end a game night with and almost everyone is leaving smiling after it. Noone I know ever had hard feelings for loosing in this.

Cons:
- It's a filler. Use with or between larger games to sweeten up the mix. A whole night of it might get a bit dull.
- I put mine in a dice bag to take it to the park or biergarden. Hive had its Carbon edition in a bag, seems obviously, really. Give us a "Bang!" bag already! :)

There is no way to predict how the dice will roll, thus true strategy is out. I can do more with cards on my hands and a little bit of time to think everything through, than with constantly changing dice.
Also the hidden roles, which were the base mechanic in the card game, in this game seem superfluous...

RATING: 7.5
This one came as surprise. I played it, found it ok, then I've played it some more, then I've never played it less than 3 times in succession. 

It's an accessible, easy to get into hidden roles game - part of accessibility being it's quickly obvious who is who. I kinda miss slow build up and psychology of Bang the card game, but maybe the dice game is something else: less psychological, more of a  partnership game (which is nice as I could always use more of them). It's like a film that starts at the final showdown. You go in guns blazing and hope it will work out. And while it doesn't have the rollercoaster ride dramaturgy of King of Tokyo it does a lot story-wise in 15 minutes. 

As in the card game, meta-rules are the same: first kill an outlaw, then deputy, then outlaw, etc. Simplicity and shortness with more or less the same amount of narrative as the card game made it a huge hit with kids/teenagers. It's our dice game of choice and our partnership game of choice (nice one for teaching kids to think outside their habits of preference for certain friends)

Game is alright but less strategic than the card game. Prefer the card game with expansion a lot more. For a light game there are many (most) others I'd much rather play. It still takes a decently long time to sit around rolling dice without any significant decisions to make on a turn.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Played once with 8P and 7P, and a couple of times with 6P. I have never played the original Bang! before, but this is a fairly harmless dice filler. Each player is given a secret alignment – either Sheriff, Outlaw or Renegade – which determines their objective for the game. During each player's turn, he or she rolls 5 dice, and is allowed to reroll them twice, Yahtzee-style. The outcome of rolls include damaging other players, healing players or even damaging oneself. 

Gameplay-wise, this plays like a light toss-up between King of Tokyo and Werewolf. There's not a lot of meat to it as most of the decisions revolve around whether certain dice should be rerolled. In my experience, it's very easy to deduce alignments in smaller groups, but difficult doing the same in larger groups. Only three die sides actually help in deducing alignments, so those looking for a solid role deduction game could be disappointed. The saving grace is that the game lasts roughly 20 minutes, which feels just right given its fluffy gameplay.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a great party-sized game.  There's a small element of bluffing/deduction, but only just enough.  It's typically no great mystery who the Outlaws are but the asymmetrical abilities add some strategy/fun to an otherwise game of chance.

[12 plays] Better than the original Bang because it is fast, there are dice, and because you always have something to do each turn until eliminated.

Good family fun.

A fun game for 5-8 players (a player count that we don't often get the chance to play with or have many games that occupy that space). The game play is super quick, and the hidden roles are done well. I'm also still a pretty big sucker for Yahtzee and this game checks all of the same boxes while also encouraging the mind game aspect that I love.

BANG! The Dice Game is one of those party games that I can always play with ANYONE. It's so simple, yet so fun, I don't care about the player elimination, it's so short that once I die for shooting the Sherriff first, I don;t mind sitting for 5 to 10 minutes smack talking the Sherriff and cheering on my fellow outlaws.

RATING: 8
Yes, this is another Yahtzee-style dice game, but this one is thematic, works well, plays quickly, and is FUN! Each player gets a role and character.  The role determines the winning condition for the player and the character provides a unique ability.  I don't think that individual player abilities are always necessary, but they work well in this game and are thematic.  The role and character combination also helps provide a strategy for each player.  This game reminds me of streamlined version of King of Tokyo.  Actually, I think I like it a bit more since it plays faster, has more player interaction, and the character abilities and roles don't just seem tacked on like in King of Tokyo.  I wasn't expecting much from this game, but I was pleasantly surprised and hope to add a copy to my collection at some point soon!

BANG! The Dice Game can easily be played solo using the 3-Player instructions representing the Deputy, Renagade, and Outlaw. The Deputy tries to eliminate the Renagade; the Renagade tries to take out the Outlaw, while the Outlaw tries to shoot the Deputy. Each player, in turn, rolls 5 dice, and gets up to 2 re-rolls. The dice facings represent: arrows, dynamite, bull's eyes, beer, and gatling guns. Arrows, dynamite, bull's eye and gatlings cause you to lose life points, while beer can heal you. Each player randomly draws a character card that gives him/her special abilities. Basically you roll the dice and apply the results with some opportunities to go for 3's (gatlings or dynamite) to effect results, or risk taking out your opponent for the win instead of trying to heal yourself. Whoever succeeds in eliminating their target first, wins. Its a very quick, very light filler.

Quick filler game. Mindless fun. 
I like the dice game better than the card game. It is a fast-pace, interactive, press-your-luck game. Lots of laughs and gotchas.  It plays best with 5 to 8 players - because then you have one or more Deputies included, and the Renegade can keep everyone guessing about who is which character type.  Play time is 15 to 25 minutes for 5 to 8 players.

The theme and characters are a lot of fun. and all the game elements and mechanics work well together.

RATING: 3
This solves the length problem in Bang, but there's a lot more luck, and I don't like the incentive structure. While the Yahtzee-style mechanic gives players some control, they're effectively punished for exercising it because with each reroll, they risk sustaining damage and shooting the wrong players, and there's no way to mitigate the risk aside from forgoing rerolls. As a result, it's usually advantageous [i]not[/i] to make decisions, except the obvious. But take away the choices and what's left?

RATING: 8
A fantastic filler. I was very skeptical about this game but I have to admit I was wrong. It fixes the flaws most players found with Bang! like the excessive length and the first turn player elimination which is still possible but very unlikely. Also, while there is still player elimination, the game is so short it is never felt as an issue. My only complaint is I wished for more interaction during other players' turn. Besides that, great filler game.

This game does a great job of streamlining Bang! into a dice game.  Each die has the following symbols:  A '1' or a '2' which indicates you shoot someone at range '1' or '2'.  A beer which indicates you can heal a player one life point.  An arrow which requires you to take an arrow token whether you re-roll it or not, once all the arrows are distributed the Indians attack and each player takes damage equal to the number of arrows they have.  A gattling gun, collecting 3 of these hurts all other players and clears your arrows. And finally, a dynamite, these can't be rerolled and collecting 3 hurts you and ends your turn.

The rest of the game is played the same as Bang!  Each player has a character with a unique power and life total and The Sheriff and Deputy are trying to kill the Outlaws and Renegade.  The Outlaws are trying to kill the Sheriff.  And the Renegade is trying to be the last man standing.

The dice game resolves some problems with Bang!  Mainly that the game can drag, this one is a fairly quick jaunt.  However there can be some situations where the more chaotic nature of this game can kind of dull the experience.  The game is all about hidden information and bluffing but sometimes the dice tell you to do something whether you want to or not.  It might be against your plan of action and it certainly ruins the whole bluffing and deceitful nature of the game that you can seemingly have no control over your actions which means other people can't interpret or gather useful information from them.

Once upon a time I loved Bang!, now there are very few hidden role games I like at all.  This game swaps some issues with Bang! for new ones but at least it plays quickly and isn't completely unenjoyable.

RATING: 6
Yahtzee's Wild West cousin. Not as good as "King of Tokyo" but better than "To Court the King". I am not the biggest push-your-luck with dice fan but the secret identities which give the game an edge of werewolf-type games (but only an edge) make this fun. For me, one of those that I am willing and enjoy playing but never suggest and seek out myself. Nice that it can accommodate up to 8, though with so many it gets more interesting once the first few players get eliminated and the choices get a bit more strategical, but then again I don't like player elimination.
Decent filler.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Definitely made for higher player counts. Most of the game is in figuring out hidden roles. Rest is just some light push your luck. It's very good at covering up its flaws with its lightning quick play time.

RATING: 9
The thrill of a foreboding spaghetti western shootout is captured beautifully.  You can almost hear an Ennio Morricone score play in the background by default.  Works in just about any group and is a blast in party situations.  Unlike the Resistance, the tension comes from the chaos of the fog of war during the gunfight - it is the primal urge of survival, rather than suspicion per se.  A must own.

Simply the best fun, fast, team, deduction, fighting game I've ever played.  I would call it a hybrid of King of Tokyo and Resistance.  There are teams, deduction, dice, and fighting. This is the highest score I've ever given out on BGG.  I generally lose more than I win this game, but it is just as much fun to win as it is to lose.  Can't speak to the original, but the dice and arrows make the game go quickly. Speaking of the arrows, it is the most unique in-game-timer I've ever seen and it really works with the theme and game.  Brilliant.

After 300 plays, the cards and arrows are a little frayed and dirty. That's less than $0.07 per game so far but I'm sure we have to retire it soon.

The first time we played this game, it lasted 5 minutes. The next time we played, it lasted about 7 minutes. After a few more games, we had a "long" game that lasted all of 12 minutes. "Bang!" is a very apt name for this type of game. Clearly, this game is not going to occupy a large portion of your game night or provide CONTINUOUS hours of fun; however, as a light filler, this game accomplishes its goal well: fast-paced, chaotic fun.

Simplified hidden role party game with the rolling of dice to cause player elimination. The different character cards add enough of a variant to make repeated play fun. As with any player elimination game, play length can become a factor if eliminated early.

Took three turns; each time rolled 2 dynamite, re-rolled three dice and got a third dynamite. That stopped being fun really quickly.

So, in summary, Bang is still rubbish. The dice version is mercifully quicker, but with perhaps more downtime.

There are many in my board game group who thought this was a waste of their time, and to just get out the card game.  Having played the card game, however, I feel like the dice game is a bit better, primarily due to the randomness and the fact you can be forced to carry out actions that mix-up the bluffing by causing innocent players to look guilty and guilty players to look innocent.  It also sets up quicker and plays quicker.

I really did not like [thing=3955][/thing].  It has player elimination and the game takes way too long.  [thing=143741][/thing] is better in every way and you should never play the original again.  But, it's still a [thing=2243][/thing]-derived dice game, so the ceiling is pretty low and competition is high.  I'm pretty sure I would rather play [thing=70323][/thing] (which I'm also 'meh' about), but at least this one has variable player powers.

Update: After playing again and getting eliminated totally arbitrarily after 1 turn, then waiting 30 minutes for the game to end, I will probably never play this again.  At least not with more than 4-5 players.

Decent social game with dice rolling. The first game might not play out to its fullest. But give it a game or two and it will finally click. When you have a good game, it's really good; really fun. It took 24 plays to finally have someone win as the Renegade. It was my personal goal to make it happen. And I finally did. It's definitely fun when you get to that point in the game and there are only a few players left, and the Sheriff doesn't know who to trust.

RATING: 6.5
This one can miss at times. Even with the same group. If the group is lower energy or the dice just don't provide many exciting rolls the game can be procedural. This rarely happens and overall it is one of the better dice conversions in boardgaming.

That this is quick to teach and accommodates up to 8 players, and does it well, makes it an invaluable game in my collection.



Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 5
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 5
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 4
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 5


Overall - 5

I'm really warming up to Bang! There's a very specific niche that this game fits. It works great as a party game when you've got 6-8 rowdy folks and you don't want to bring the energy down with a more structured hidden role game (say, ONUW or The Resistance).

I wish I get to play this.  But every time that we get over 5 people in the group, this is not the game people want to play.  Bang the card game was well loved back in the day.  But it played too long.  The dice version should fix the problem, but I guess everyone else in my game group is jaded with Bang and there are also other better multi-player games out there.  It's a shame.  I really like this game.

Quick, simple, but - most importantly - fun! I like the hidden roles. The cards being both Italian and English adds a lot of fun to my group, because we keep referring to the roles by those names and put up fake accents. The dice-rolling is what keeps this game so high on my list. It's, as someone in my group said, King of Tokyo with hidden roles and spurs on your boots. 

I've seen some games go by horribly wrong, mostly because of sheriffs accidentally gunning down a deputy in the first round. Luckily, games don't last that long and it's quick to set up for another round.

Shooting your friends/family is fun!

The 1st couple games we played we didn't really know what we were doing or what to look out for but this game really does grow on you. The more you play the more you are likely to find clues from your opponents on who their identity truly is!

The only problem with the balance of the game is the Renegades... how are they supposed to win?! 

Epic game though!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Bang! The Dice Game is essentially the same experience as the card game... simplified. The things that you lose in the dice version don't actually detract from the game. Instead they just make the game less fiddly. And it helps avoid the situations that would make the card game draw out longer than needed.

All in all, the dice version is better than the card game, but not significantly so. I wouldn't really care to play either. But if forced, I'd choose this over the other.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Take Bang! the card game, then make it WAY easier to shoot people and you have it! It's shorter, the turns go faster, it's easier to understand what to do on your turn, and rolling those dice is far more pleasing. Also, it's so satisfying to see your neighbor watch in anticipation as you throw those cubes of fate upon the table all while knowing the fate they determine is probably their own. Oh yeah, get the expansion ;)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Good little game of hidden roles and elimination.  Short, so you never have to worry about being out long.  Lots of different character roles too.

Can fall flat with some groups though...need people to have an idea of what is going on (i.e. that the Renegade is essentially fighting for the Sheriff early doors).

But that could be said about most games.  A good laugh, and a push your luck with the Yahtzee dice mechanic.

RATING: 7
I picked up this game thinking it would be a social deduction game, but it really isn't.  It feels more similar to King of Tokyo than to a social deduction game.  Sure, everyone has a secret team, and at the beginning of the game they are trying to make the sheriff think that they are the deputy, but pretty early into every game I've played it turned into a dice rolling battle where the lines were clearly drawn.  There can be situations with deception as a component, but it just doesn't happen as often as I'd like.  The dice game itself is a rather fun one, to be fair, and I like the special powers each player gets.  Overall, it is a fun and silly time, but the social deduction part is weak.

Good:
-Plays quick
-Plays a lot of players
-Easily explained
-Hidden roles
-Gateway game
-Good for shy people
-A deduction game for people who feel uncomfortable lying

Bad:
-It's too hard to win as the renegade
-Some special powers could be better explained
-Special powers are not balanced
-When certain pairs are left, the game can drag
-The first to attack the Sheriff almost always dies first

Overall:
When The Resistance is becoming formulaic or making you feel exhausted, this is a great choice to change the pace.  Thinking is light and quick with less finger pointing.  This is especially good when your group contains a lot of shy people who disappear in games (like the Resistance) where strong personalities dominate.

Good game that has replaced the cardgame version of Bang in my collection. It offers the same level of drama in a shorter time. I mean, there is still a lot of laughing and shouting going on, but it can never outlast its welcome as some plays of the cardgame did, dragging out for almost two hours. Especially recommended for players who like King Of Tokyo and have the opportunity to regularly play with a group of 5+ people.
Two ratings: a 7 when played on its own, but an 8 when played with Old Saloon. Never play without it.

RATING: 4.5
Purchased Bang! The Dice Game 2 years after Bang!, in the hopes that it would alleviate the pacing issues of its parent, but it has even more problems. Interactions are so limited that the hidden information aspect is almost irrelevant, and the game is all luck/no strategy.

Despite the simple mechanics, I have still seen games drag on, and as there are no out-of-turn actions like in Bang!, there is even less to watch while waiting for your next turn.

The overabundance of healing encourages the game to be longer than it should and further undermines the hidden roles by making it extremely obvious when players help each other.

Having played it a handful of times, have no desire to play again but will still kill time with it occasionally when other players request it. Rating: 3

Update as of Nov 2015: having played this ~10 more times with more casual groups, my antipathy has waned a bit and I now view it as a more tolerable, laugh-about-it time-killer. Updated rating: 4.5

A fast-paced take on the classic card game. My group typically busts out the Bang! Card game whenever we have our extended friend circle around, since our typical gaming group only consists of 4. Bang Dice has been taking the card game's place as of late, as it feels less laborious. The random dice element does leave a bit more to chance, and the hidden identity element isn't quite as important anymore, but a solid party-style game.

I was very disappointed from this game. I usually love those hidden roles, hidden goals games. But in this, you don't really have a real chance to influence your opponents at all. You roll dice and can do your actions according to the result. 
There is no possibility to "disguise" your role, in each and every round we played, it was soon clear who's who and then it was only rolling dice and that is not really interesting.
All in all I cannot recommend it

Want to say up front that this game really shouldn't be advertised as playable 3-8.  3 player and 4 player don't even feel like a game, might as well play Zombie Dice at that point.

If you get a big group though, ideally 7, this game is pretty fun.  It can move very quick but you can still get surprises as you try to figure out who is on your team, you may end up healing the person that wants to kill you.  The randomness of the dice actually help a lot in making people unpredictable because sometimes people can act out of character just by how the dice fall.

For whatever reason though, I've just never had a particularly great game of it.  I've tried with multiple groups and it always just feels a bit flat.

RATING: 4
Same pointless drivel that is the card game.  This one's slightly better, as at least there's no language independent cards to decipher.  But the same problem is present with the wild imbalance in goals for the different factions.  The renegade is never going to win.  If there's more outlaws than good guys, the good guys will never win either.  The only way to get away from this is if somebody wants to play not in their own best interest.  This doesn't even do spaghetti western right.

RATING: 8
It takes everything that is good about BANG! and condenses it down to a 15-20 minute experience.  It's fun to play this 3 or 4 times in a row...and you can play that many times in the amount of time that 1 game of BANG! would take.

Na itt ez nem fordul elo... adva van egy poros utca, ahol 3-8 marcona alak pisztolyt rant! Csak a sheriff kilete a biztos, a tobbiek szandekait majd abbol lehet kifurkeszni, merre lonek! Minden karaktertipusnak mas a celja, de modszer azonos. Egy marek kocka eldobasa, ketszeri ujradobas, majd az eredmeny vegrehajtasa. Lovessel csak a melletunk, vagy az egyel arrebb ulore vagyunk veszelyesek (persze ahogy kiesnek a jatekosok, szukul a kor, vegul mindenki lo mindenkire!), kiveve, ha beulunk a gatling moge, es vegigrotaljuk az egesz placcot. A dinamitra figyelni kell, mert alank robbanhat, raadasul idonkent az indianok is megbatorodnak es tuparnava valtoztatjak a jatekosokat!

RATING: 6
Commented after two plays, a quick and easy to teach game. Quite random and might get a little bit chaotic, but it is short enough.

If you know the original BANG! and Yahtzee, then this game is simply a mix of these two. The cards of BANG! are changed to five dice, which have different symbols (shoot a player next to you, get one health and so on). It is possible to re-roll the dice two times, then the dice are resolved and turn ends. Players have hidden roles (sheriff, deputy, outlaw, renegade) and visible character roles, which give some special abilities, so each play is little bit different.

Updated after third play, this time we got all the rules correct. There's no much control in the game, quite random, but fast and fun.

Fifth play behind, feels more random than before.

Three plays with 6, felt better than before, but was still quite random. A lot depends on the sitting order, I think.

Nice and quick filler. Sitting order might affect the play from time to time, but these latest plays (6) didn't feel that random. They were actually quite clear.

Grim hidden role game where no one bothered to deduce hidden roles, but just rolled dice to try to kill the person with the lowest hit points. 

Player elimination added to the grimness, and it seemed to go on forever, with players giving each other hit points and healing the Sheriff.

I far prefer One Night Ultimate Werewolf and the Resistance. 

[Played with 7].

RATING: 7
RNG heavy entry/filler-type game of hidden roles. Pretty good for 6-8 players and super easy to teach.

For some reason this game has a tendency to cause a reasonable amount of trash talk around the table. More than in other hidden role games. This trashing often ends up being the most enjoyable part of playing this game rather than the game and its mechanics itself.

I quess that's a merit of the game design but it's hard to tell.

This game is super quick. It is extremely fun. The dice randomness takes some of the strategy out of the game, but so did the cards in original BANG! This could definitely use an expo. Notably absent are the barrel mechanics, knives, mustangs, and jail. These would greatly improve the game if they could be cleverly implemented in an expo.

An expo is coming, it doesn't appear to have any of these features.

Fine for what it is but not my type of game. I like the idea that the roll of the dice mitigate your choices causing the hidden roles to be better obscured but ultimately feel hidden roles can be done better in the same time frame without player elimination. The other element, dice chucking isn't really my bag.

Light, fun, and ultra-fast "deduction" dice game. I put "deduction" in quotes because the roles usually shake out pretty quick. Occasionally a Renegade can throw you for a loop though, and those are usually the most fun games.

Takes everything that's fun about Bang! (puns, bald-face lying, shooting your friends, neat character abilities, winning as the Renegade), cuts out the stuff that sucks (long playtime, turtling, bad/confusing iconography), swaps out the cards for dice and calls it a day. Sometimes simpler is better, and Bang! The Dice Game is one such time.

great game similar to good cop bad cop but I like the randomness of the dice.  So far the game feels a little outlaw heavy depending on the number of player and feels like the sheriff has no chance in hell to win, but still over all a fun game.

The game I hate the most is Bang. How can I like the dice version of it? Well, simply put almost everything I hate about Bang is fixed here.

- the game is way faster so player elimination is less of a problem
- instead of the cards that just don't really give you any combos or decisions, here you get a pretty clever push your luck game. arrow and dynamite symbols make rerolling a real decision.
- hidden roles don't make much sense in Bang, but here, - again, because of game length - it's not a problem, and also because you must use the shots you rolled it gives place for some interesting i only did it because i had to tabletalk

Great filler. Takes everything that made Bang! great, and slims it down to 15-20 minutes.

BANG! was a huge dud for me (pun totally intended). It was slow, clumsy and full of a sense of "rubber-banding". For a game named after perhaps the most violent onomatopoeia there is, it really didn't deliver on the thrill of a six-gun shoot-out.

Along comes the dice game and it's pretty much everything that I was hoping the original game would be. It's fast, dirty and in-your-face. Guns are blazing, arrows are flying and somebody's about to die. Hopefully they're not one of your own.

I've heard some deride the dice game for being more chaotic/random because of the dice. My response is: "That's exactly what I want from a filler game about cowpoke shootin' each other!" I personally feel that the Yahtzee-esque dice mechanisms add just the right amount of control, coupled with a delightfully-tense push-your-luck element.

If that's all the game were, it'd be good for a few yucks but it's the hidden role/team aspect that gives it legs. Combine the social deduction bit with a furious dice-fest and you've got an experience that almost always ends in a good time.

Not really a fan of Bang! but I found this slightly more tolerable. I prefer the dice over the nonsense of the cards in Bang! but I don't like the randomness.

Bang! The Dice Game may or may not be better than the original. It just [i]seems[/i] more fun, I think, because players roll dice rather than slap down cards.

Case in point: The same flaws still exist, and they're just as dumb as they were before. Players can die without having a turn, for example, which is exactly as fun as you might think.

And like the original, there's no way I'd play the dice version with the maximum number of players.  It's possibly best with six, since with five or fewer players anyone can get hit with a 2-range damage roll.

My unsurprising conclusion is that Bang! Dice isn't worth owning, and is possibly not worth playing again. King of Tokyo is the far better game, so if dice are on your mind consider shelling out a few extra bucks for the higher-quality product.

Faster version of Bang!, but obviously more random with the dice. Good for a quick, fun version of Bang! Strategy is obviously compromised in this game, as compared to original Bang! However, it is fun, and doesn't drag on. Some groups I play with prefer the dice version, while others prefer the card one. I would suggest to at least try it, before you buy it. Personally, I am willing to play both versions, although I still like the relatively stronger depth of the card version (with Bullet expansions) better.

Dice + temporary bluffing + cowboys

Enjoyable enough as a quick filler, the bluffing doesn't last very long, as it becomes obvious who everyone is after 1-2 rounds. That being said, the player count is nice, it's easy to get into, it's great when the native Americans just kill everybody, you have a team mate (NOT YOU RENEGADE.... unless you have max players) and you have an ability.

The hidden roles and different agendas for each role make this game good. Every player is involved all the time to keep an eye on what the others are doing and that keeps the game interesting, even when it is not your turn.

I never want to play the original again. This scales well for large player counts, has a lot of variety, and is a fun dice chucker. It's not always balanced, but it plays so fast.

It's a pretty fun take on the basic Yahtzee! dice mechanic, and indeed plays a lot better than the original game of the franchise. However, it's only really good between 5 and 8 players, and it does snowball once the first player is eliminated from the game.

Too fast & furious. The game has lost a lot of tension as everybody reveals themselves quickly and just attack their targets as fast as possible.

Meh. Played a bunch of times but just doesn't interest me as much as I'd hoped. I can see this dropping. A 6 is generous courtesy of the crowd I played with.

A good filler but best played with the higher player counts.

It's an exercise is semi-random victory. Your fate is obviously highly controlled by the players, and you are very rarely going to be able to dictate the flow of the game around you. Entertaining with a lightweight-game favouring group, but not something I would pick up for my collection.

Acquistato da GamesAcademy Palermom finalmenre il 1 novembre 2016 lo abbiamo giocato. Non male anche se in tre perde parecchio appeal.... voto 7 per lo spirito western ma gioco poco adatto ai gruppi poco numerosi. Aggiornamento, provato a dicembre 2016 a casa di amici. Bellissimo in gruppo di 5 / 6 persone uno dei miei giochi preferiti che purtroppo non posso giocare essendo sempre in tre in linea di massima quindi scegliamo altri giochi.

My partner ranks this game 8.25 I rank this game around 7.50. Her family liked this game her mother won 3 out of 5 matches in one. It's fast, easy to learn, not all that much memorization. Even my family who like just basic card games, even monopoly (with no trading or auctioning) liked this game. We played another 5 rounds this time every one won 1 time but my father one twice.

Pretty good for what it is. The player elimination doesn't seem to bother me.

Quick dice game suitable for beer and pretzels, but that's about it. Player elimination not really that much of a problem because of how quick the game is.

This game just clicks for me. All the elements are things I typically enjoy in games: lightning fast, neat custom dice, character roles, hidden partners/teams. Excellent stuff.

My love for bows and arrows seem to affect this cool card game, as the arrows from American Indians seem to have taken a liking to me. :(

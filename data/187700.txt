This is a well produced game. Loving the quality ;) 
I've played a few games and it's the most strategic skirmish game I've played in a long time.

A great mech combat free-for-all game. Rules are straight-forward, and game play is well paced and exciting. The not-so-small miniatures are beautiful. Add-ons give the game more depth and variety.

I had the privilege to play this at Wellycon with pretty much the final production copy. And this game fully realised my wish for a tactical robot combat game.

Components are jaw dropping. When you see the board all setup for the first time, you just pause and stare. My inner 10 year old couldn't be happier.

Gameplay is where it's really at though. The dice chucking element gave me trepidation at first. But as the game progress this just added dramactic moments in the game. Sure the odd occasions you could get really bad dice rolls, but this isnt nearly important as tatical planning,positioning,flanking, and reading your opponents.

This is like a multiplayer chess match, with dice.

This game is actually a really good game, and the chrome is a bonus.

A game involving giant robots, which means it's automatically great in my eyes. For a more certain evaluation, though, we'll need to wait a couple months.

Been following this game since the Kickstarter launched and have watched lots of demos and thoroughly read the rulebook.

In the post apocalyptic world  of GKR you pilot of a corporate sponsored Heavy Hitter - a giant salvage mech the size of a skyscraper and outfitted for war. Supported by Recon, Combat and Repair drones you face off against another corporate team tryng to tag the most buildings to earn salvage rights and claim sectors of the earths ruined cities for your corporation.
In a world where corporate greed is par for the course you'll need to wow fans to unlock sponsorship boons giving you the edge against your opponent.

The health of your heavy hitter is represented by the strength of your deck. Players start with 25 cards which can be played to activate weapon systems or startegies in the game. As you take damage you discard cards from your deck giving you fewer options to use. Once you're  out of cards your rigs out of the fight. Push your rig too hard and you burn through your deck even faster.

Gameplay is very tactical - 1v1 games take about 45 minute to play 4 player games take that up to 90 minutes. Rules are straightforward with a good dynamic activation system so players wont get bored between rounds, and lots of unique features that should make this a success.

2/12/18 - Kickstarter arrived, first 2er game was interesting. This game features a build your combat systems deck, dice roll combat with potential modifiers. It's fun and not overwhelmingly complex.

RATING: N/A
This seems like a game that would exist in the "Chappie" (terribly dystopian) world - model scale too big for board and "building" minis. Helper bot mini bases extremely overbuilt. Upgraded dice should have been stretch goal not add-on. At least the aesthetic is consistent. Don't see why the pilots are so specific

Great light miniatures game with strong table presence. In 3/4 players, player elimination can be a drag as someone may be knocked out early. Great fun, highly recommend.

Friends KS version from NZ release event. 

Played our first game and thought it was a blast. Interested to see how the deckbuilding works as we pretty much picked random cards and pilots for our first game. 

Solid fun, and vicious on the "leader". Going first sucks

This is an initial impression.  The success of the game is heavily based on your dice rolls.  There are a few cards that you can play to manipulate the dice rolls, but not too many.  Since both attacks and defending is only based on a single roll.  I feel the game is a bit too random.  I am going to give game a few more tries before giving my final verdict.

This game really struggles to decide if it wants to be a miniatures game or a deckbuilder. It was surprisingly clunky even though it is supposed to be very approachable. Maybe I'm not the right crowd for this game.

Got to demo at GenCon...  and WOW what beautiful components!!!  Game was fast and easy to learn with lots of action!  Just wish some of the support units were a bit more useful... but the game is being developed.  I will review and alter the rating once it's released!

The game is a little shallow and has a bit too much luck in it.  Models are excellent and it is fun.  I don't think it has legs and though it will get to the table in our gaming group I doubt we will be playing it much come the fall.

Waiting for an official FAQ or errata on the game to clarify a few points. But overall very well thought out, great materials and fun theme. Not sure whether Weta or Cryptozoic is taking the lead as far as updates and expansions go. Would love updated PDFs to be available online, but at time of writing not all kickstarter backers have received their rewards. So probably not for a while :(

The game looks neat enough... until I saw that it is from Cryptozoic (or Craptozoic as they're more commonly known). The designer has made the awful Ghostbusters game, the awful Walking Dead board game, and the lazy (but admittedly mediocre) DC Deckbuilding game. Craptozoic is also responsible for bringing an awful Cthulhu Monopoly clone into the world when it would have just died off otherwise.

Player elimination, dice-fest combat, and take-that cards. Oof...

It's too bad Weta didn't choose a better publisher and designer to work with.

Pass.

This game has an amazing theme and production, however has issues of runaway leaders and king making. 

It feels like there is a bit of a runaway leader issue. Getting support bots into play is important as each one allows you to get an additional tag into a building. 4 tags on a building of your colour and you destroy it. Also the more buildings you tag in a round the more special ability cards you draw. However, if your support bots get destroyed in combat they won't tag. 

Combat is a dice rolling affair. Roll 7 or more on two dice to hit a support bot. Then the defender rolls 1 dice per attack value, needing 6s to prevent damage. Also different attacks have different speeds meaning your support bot will always attack before mine. A lucky roll or two can knock me out before I can respond, meaning I can't attack back and am down a unit to tag buildings and get a card.

In addition to this you move up a track for reaching achievements such as flanking a heavy hitter or tagging more buildings than anyone else. As you move up these tracks you reduce the roll you need to hit your opponents. So, to carry on the example, not only have you knocked out my bot and tagged an additional building, you also make it more likely that you will hit me in the future!

I knew half way into a 3 hour game that I had no chance of winning. But then in the final round of combat I had an orbital strike that could do 4 combat damage without the chance to be prevented. Both my opponents were in a position to tag their 4th building and win, but I could take out either of their bots leaving the other as victor. Not a position I was happy to be in, especially 3 hours in!

Giant Killer Robots, mech vs mech, miniatures wargame. Card driven action programming.  Very nice production quality, insane primary mech's, and 3D buildings to tag and destroy.  I like how damage is taken by losing cards from your hand or deck. What a great thematic way to represent malfunctioning/inoperative systems.  Preferred and more interesting than the traditional points total that serves no other purpose than determining the end.

This is a really good skirmish game for all ages, there is a reasonable amount of customization out of the core box and if there is support for this game after launch I foresee a very healthy competitive scene building around it.

The production quality of these minis is OK (by normal standards) However since this is Weta Workshop's I was somehow expecting something above par. 
We know that it is possible to have extremely well produced minis based on other games, it's just a little disappointing to not see Weta live up to it's reputation.

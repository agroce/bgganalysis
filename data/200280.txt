So far I've only played it once. I feel like we played it wrong since there was just little going on. Have to give this another try

RATING: N/A
The game drips with theme.   The mixture of fantasy, magic and beer brewing is a lot of fun.  The reply value is very fun and each race feels very different.  The game is very simple to learn, but the depth really shines after a few plays.

Surprisingly good game. The fantasy beer drinking theme and jovial artwork are deceptive as this game offers a lot to the strategic board gamer. It's got a pretty hefty footprint with all the cards and some of the gameplay seems chaotic at first, but rest assured you will enjoy this if you enjoy resource gathering and a sort of crafting aspect.

Excellent game, many different ways of playing and winning.
Looking forward to many more brewing hours.

Got a chance to play with the designer over Tabletopia and had a blast.  There were three of us, and we all played with really different races that led to different play stayles.  We went in a lot of different directions to get points and all managed to be pretty successful.  I came in second! :D

I loved using my little guys to go around and gather the ingredients I needed for my many beers.  There's a lot of planning involved--the order in which you take your actions really matters!  I also loved the judging phase, because there's some light creativity involved with pitching your beer.  Really enjoyed it!

Tried this game at Kublacon last weekend. I was very impressed with the mechanics and fun player interaction. Who wouldn't love to be a fantasy character race that competes to make the best beer brew!? The game looks easy at first but I quickly learned how complex and challenging it was because there are so many options to choose from. This game seems to have many different ways to win, I loved that aspect! Scores were close and the winner unclear until the very end.

RATING: 8.5
First Game last night with 4. Quite intimidating at first, but after the first year in the game, everyone got it and rest flowed really well.

The brew and judging phase produced a lot of laughs, which is a great break from the puzzle you are trying to solve up to that point. Really tight score at the end with the top three players with two points of each other.

Production quality is very good and rule book easy to follow. Cards are a bit small and tricky to read, however, that was an understandable choice given table space restrictions. 

Possibly a bit long with 4 and I'm not sure I love the art. Other than that, one of the best Euro Games I've played. Thumbs up from me

I played a demo of this at Kublacon.  There is a lot of resource gathering but the planning on how to manipulate the voting of the final beers so you can capture the high point judges without losing your strong entry to a minor judge first, that was entertaining and challenging!

RATING: 9
Excellent game with a ton of replay. There are so many combinations of races to play as and the judges alter game play based on what types of beer you need to be making.

2017-10-16 : First play. Bog standard worker placement placement engine building game with no special features or nifty new mechanics. A bit puzzly. No real challenge. Good artwork and components. The sort of game where one year from now you totally forgot you played it..

I have been play testing an pre-production test copy of the game.  Dragon Brew is simple to learn, but has quite a bit of depth and strategy that will offer a vast amount of replayability.  A player takes on a fantasy character race, managing and building resources to create different Beer brews.  The brews are judged by various character each with a preference of beer characteristics.  This is one game to look out for.  A definite purchase for me when it is released.

Great game!  Thinky with lots of strategy.  Also has a ton of replayability with so many different races to choose from.  Highly recommend.

Still unplayed, the art and theme isn't helping me get it to the table. I'm intrigued, my regular group is not into beer, so it kind of serves as an obstacle. I will play a mock game and see if I can justify trying to get it played.

RATING: 8
After playing one or two rounds the game is easy to grasp, yet still many choices can be made, and your race gives you a nudge in a certain direction. I like the playful art, and creating your beer which leads to super fun names is a surprising fun factor in a worker placement game like this. This can easily be played will drinking some good beer, because while the thinking part is there, it is not overtaxing.

I played this game at Kublacon and it was the favorite thing I've played this weekend. You can draw comparisons to Viticulture(which I enjoyed) but this game does booze making better. The pacing and mechanics I felt were super strong, and the theme was fantastic.

A seemingly simple worker placement and drafting game, which gets more intense and needs an increasing amount of attention without mapping your brain.  There are some very clever aspects to managing the races and goals which gives this a lot of replayability.  Ironically, on my first play through I knocked over a beer on the board so now it is scented appropriately!

Had a chance to play this game with my friend Toby at 2016 Geekway to the West. It was supposedly still in development but as far as I can tell there is very little, if anything, to improve upon at this time. 

The game itself is a solid mix of worker placement and resource gathering that encourages a consideration for order of operations. Players choose different races, equipped with their own unique style, and brew beer for a yearly judging contest. The game is deceptively simply with a lot of depth.

I can't wait to get my hands on a copy to play again!

There was nothing that this game did very well. It was a fairly generic worker placement game, with fairly generic resource collection/exchange. The theme was almost non existent past the initial race selection. They only part that I enjoyed was the names of the created beers, but that wasn't worth the 2 hour play time.

Kickstarter. Generic worker placement for 2-4 players (best with 4). Use your meeples to harvest crops and turn it into wort, then beer. Spice with some magic to please the judges in the yearly competition. Looks complicated at first, but the engine and rules are really simple and easy to learn. Plays in about 3 hours. I like worker placement games but this one has to much luck for my tastes, and it lacks interaction between players. It's a bit of a party game and should have lots of player interacton to be funny. But it's limited to snatching good cards from the draw pool and competing for the judges. You play the rest of the game by yourself. Slightly boring if you get the "wrong" recepies and realise you won't be able to win any competitions. Variation is quite low despite numerous races. They're all played roughly the same way (it's the recepies that count anyway). In the end it's an okay game, but not great. Will play occationally if in the right mood. Score 6.

Cute recipe fulfillment game that may be a bit too long and dry for what it is. Will play more to make ultimate judgement.

A brilliant card draft/worker placement game with more subtle strategy than first seems.
Very high quality production, clear and simple rules and an awesome theme; this is actually better than Viticulture in my humble opinion and easily much more fun (especially when it comes to presenting the beers to the judges!)
* upgraded to 10. Honestly - everytime this hits the table it is a hit!

I don't play worker placement games a lot, but this one could be one to be played more than once.
Every player has an estate which contains his possible actions, where he can place his workers. With money you can expand this estate or buy one time actions which (should) help you. 
With the available actions you should gather ingredients and recipes in order to brew beers which you then show the judges to earn points and money.
The ultimate goal is to make the most victory points.
At the beginning it seems quite complicated but you soon get into the rules and realise that it is absolutely simple to play.
I was surprised how little downtime it produces, you can always plan your turn ahead, except for some cards that may be taken away by the other players.
Thanks to the many many many races the replayability is guaranteed... I really liked this and can surely recommend this

RATING: 6
Fortuitous draws of recipe cards seems to be (perhaps too) key to success in this game.  

This is an action selection game where you use meeples to denote your used actions.  Actions are only available on your own tableau, which means that there is no Action Drafting.  You will still find people referring to this as a Worker Placement game - it is not.
Despite some races seeming worse than others (or at least having bonuses that seem much more difficult to use well), I have seen players not take advantage of their racial bonuses and hindered by weaknesses and still win - again recipe cards seem key.

Just arrived via Kickstarter. Great theme. Ultimately simpler to play than it initially looks once you get a few rounds going (didn't play with the corrupt judge option yet). Lot's of different races would seem to add to re-playability. 11 year old daughter enjoyed it and would play again.
Edit, turns out 11 year old loves the game and consistently wants to re-play (likes the different fantasy races she can choose and strategizing with the recipe cards)

Played at KublaCon and really liked it! I'm generally a fan of worker placement games and this one does not disappoint. Great artwork too.

I played two games of Hero Clix with a member of our gaming group. We were the only ones available for our Wed. night sessions and I thought it would be fun to do, as he really likes the game and competes in tournaments quite succesfully. As a former 40k player (2nd & 3rd editions mostly) I thought I could handle it. I was wrong!

The mechanics themselves are very simple, but the crazy amount of special rules and changing conditions made the game quite difficult to keep a handle on. Needless to say, I got slaughtered pretty badly. I can see how the game could be fun, especially if you're into comics, but I just have no desire to commit the amount of time and money required to make it fun for me.

RATING: 3.5
I own about 100 of the older miniatures (many from the original Marvel set) and several maps. Seeing the quality of the more recent minatures makes me tempted to by a few new boxes however I'm not into the collectable aspect. If you take the theme (and liscences) away, the game would still be somewhat enjoyable but there really are manybetter alternatives.

Please note, the Rules may have changed significantly since I last purchased any around 2006 x

The collectability of the figures is fun (and lucrative for the companies involved!), but the gameplay is too simple to involve much strategy, and very dry.  Not a good evocation of the colorful, fast-action nature subject matter.

Points for characters, group them together, put them on a map and let the battle begin.

Wonder why they need a map. They eventually will meet beside each other and fight it out anyway.

Breaking from battle are seldom possible till usually one side is defeated.

Thematic, simple and fun.

Good for comic-book lovers, interesting strategy factors, simple rules. Abusive prices, but interesting game even if you have only a few figures.

EDIT: Player of the first edition (DC Hypertime). The newest edition makes unnecessary overcomplicated rules, just to make sure you will buy more and more figures. But the worst thing is that gameplay is boring. At least, the old one was funny.

Yeah, its collectable... but I love this game. It has strategy and planning in team building and execution on a game map, and then the element of luck to ruin the best laid plans.

I've only played this once and it was over really quick! I should really learn to play as the miniatures are amazing and I keep buying more!!
Actually playing this now. I suck as I haven't gotten used to whats the most useful when picking pieces. But quite fun even though I suck at the 'try to roll a six' play.

Played it one time with my son. All of this "collector" game makes you buy more and more to get to the figure you want, like gambling it is additive, but you need to spend some money to have something playable. Better spend on German games. Plus the figures are not that great...

RATING: 9.4
Simply one of those evergreen games that continues to add value with the more characters and IPs its swallows up. I played this over a decade ago using the old Mage Knight figures and thought it was neat, but only recent caught the bug to collect it, and decided it was more fitting to the superhero theme, so I mash up a lot of DC and Marvel as well as the other properties that mix well with it...Indy Clix (Hellboy, etc), TMNT, and so forth. The dial clicks are neat, but where this shines is as a straight up customized miniatures duel game. Some of the sculpts look wonderful, some not so much, but they're at such a small scale that you'll soon forget about that as you're putting together themed teams, etc.

Rules are fairly easy to grasp, and once you're used to them the strategies start to unfold. Many ways to play the game, many maps to use, and I really enjoy the scenario aspect and hope to see a lot more with that. One of the most fun games of its type, giving you all the thrill of more expensive miniatures systems at a fraction of the cost, since you don't 'need' to collect much of it to play. I enjoy this so much that I bought all the Great Lake Avengers...process that.

Own:
Blackest Night starter set
Watchmen Fast Forces starter
TMNT starter box
100s of single figure purchases
Stack of map purchases

RATING: 6
Fun game but requires sizable investment in "decent" figs to be competitive.  Hard to find enough players so I became more of a collector.  It's not boring but if I want to play a miniature game, there are better options out there now like X-Wing, Attack Wing, or even the one based on tall ships (which looks really cool).  I'm burned out on the whole "collectible" side of gaming from MTG so I didn't want to ride that roller coaster again with HC.

Poorly written rules. (Even the "getting started" quick play rules required reading the real rule book to understand.)  Little to no thought put towards how powers would interact.  Little to no thought put towards what expansions would introduce.  Some poor color coding choices.  Little consistency between colors between expansions (such as "light blue" in one set being identical to the different "blue" power in another).  Errata doesn't always have the best track record itself.
Play only if you are part of a gaming group.  Or you just like collecting the figures.

Bit of an obsession for me, I have to buy myself some 'plastic crack' at every opportunity.

There are plenty of flaws, of course. The barrier to new players, now that there are so many powers, mechanics and errata in play, is staggering, if I was just getting into the game now I'd find it incomprehensible. There are exploitable combos and cheesy teams that are no fun at all to play against, and you're relying on your opponent not to be a burke to get a good, fun game. The production values of the figures is poor, with frequent defects, and rules changes occur all the time. The collectable aspect of the game means that you will spend hundreds of pounds a year to keep current, get frequent duplicate figures, and have figures in your collection that you never get around to using.

Still, with an experienced umpire, and a group of fun-focussed players to play against (I am lucky enough to have both), even competitive play is a blast. I get a game of clix at every possible opportunity, and enjoy it every time, so I can't give anything less than a perfect rating. Be vary aware though, that to play requires heavy investment and someone experienced to teach you how, and your mileage from poorly painted superheroes with bent and folded stat cards will vary.

The idea of Heroclix is one of the greatest innovations in the entire gaming industry. In this day and age of instant gratification and dumbing things down, Heroclix is the perfect solution for the miniatures industry, and gaming in general. I've liked playing the game, but there are flaws due to all of the extraneous fluff rules like breakaways, the interactions between characters of various altitudes, and so much more. We've found these rules to add little to nothing to the game, while requiring us to constantly refer back to the rule book for clarifications on technical and petty differences. Overall, superhero Heroclix would be a very enjoyable game and get a much higher rating if it weren't for these superfluous rules.

Great game for comic book fans and, although the rules change frequently, they usually change so that they are more balanced and make more sense. Not too expensive to simply start and get a few good figures (Fantastic Four starter is very playable and will set you up with good 300-400 point teams for about $20), but there are a ton to collect if you want to.

Cool minis skirmish game. Just keep your teams thematic and withing their universe and superhero battles were never more fun!

As a newer player, there is a bit too much info for the first 2-3 games, but after you assimilate the different powers it turns into a fantastic experience.
The fact that MANY different heroes and maps are available makes this a very replayable game.

The bad side? Collectible, blind-buy boosters, can get expensive fast.

Got swept up in how cool the minis in this game are, and bought a bunch of singles, along with a few starters and a couple of extra maps. Played a few games and found it really annoying trying to keep track of each character's ever-changing abilities, and the action token mechanic is so stupidly fiddly. Add to that the competitive collectible aspect, where rarer characters are often better and... The game seems a bit of a mess, but I still think the figures are cool. I kept the NEXTWAVE characters just 'cause they're so awesome. (I kick your face!)

I love table top miniature games.  Really any game with great pieces can catch my attention.  Out of all the Clix games, this one is my favorite. Probably because it involves Marvel and DC characters.  Really enjoyable game, but like most games of it's type, there is quite the learning curve and expense to enter it.  So chances decrease of finding anyone worth their salt who wants to play you.  

As my kids have gotten older these mini games are seeing more play. Good times!

HeroClix is probably the best minis game playable in an hour. It has a semi-steep learning curve, as the amount of customization and abilities is pretty high. In an apparent effort to balance that out for its general market, the attack system of rolling two d6s is elementary at best. That being said, it keeps the game moving. Balance issues plague the game as new sets are released, but if you can agree with friends on models to use then it can be an enjoyable experience. It has a lot of synergy and interaction between both friendly and enemy models, which a lot of minis games lack.

RATING: 6
Action figures that are a game--I wish they had this stuff when I was a kid.  The character production is well done, and the detailed rules / variety of characters give you a lot of options.  As with most collectible games, the real strategy is in building your force--which is a lot of fun in itself.

I was quite into this game for a stretch (I was a Judge too).  It is as much fun as you are going to have with superheroes on a tabletop.  Not a bad approximation of comic book battles.  I haven't bought figures since 2005.

A fun game of super-powered combat, but, unfortunately, it has its flaws.  Collectibility makes it tough to get all the pieces you want, and rules anomalies seem to crop up almost every time something is clarified (only to be reversed or reclarified later).

It's pretty much a dicefest.  It's not only random due to dice, but it's really random depending on what figures your opponent brings.  Many games are decided before they even start due to matchups where one player happened to bring figures that can exploit the weaknesses of the other.

And it's collectible which means it's VERY expensive.

We mostly got it for our 4 year old son who loves super heros and is almost getting to the point where he can play games with rules.  Currently, we either simplify the rules a lot or don't play with any.  Sometimes we just move or have races by roling the dice.  Good practice with numbers.

I sold this one in a recent "Clix" purge (though I did keep MechWarrior for now) and it's probably my second favorite to MechWarrior.

I sort of loathe the collectable aspect and I think I'm done with all the collectable crap in general (though I still by those @*#! D&D miniatures).

A good fun enjoyable strategy game if you have the right opponent. All too often if your opponent has the money or a vast enough collection of figures, the game simply becomes a whitewash with no fun involved. The rules are ok but need a serious overhaul.

RATING: 8
Good game, but it has some flaws. If you like not too complicated strategy games, with rather cheap figures, it is good for you. 
Nowdays you can purchase the figures one by one, online. 
But, back in 2005, when I played this as a child, it was VERY hard to get the characters I wanted, because in my country only one shop had this game, and they only sold it in those random booster packs.
It has so many PREPAINTED figures with different abilities, so it has great potential, even If you don't buy too many figures.
The main flaw is, because it is a game with figures, it requires much greater space than the card games, but If you have a big room, or a club with a normal player community, its OK.
I'd like to play with it again, even if I like card games much better.

Luke, you don't know the power of the dark side. I can stop collecting anytime. I haven't bought a heroclix for 6 hours straight. 

I now have almost 800 unique figures with no duplicates out of a possible 1250+ . I have bought all these in about a month and a half. I just bought single figures no boosters. 

But now on to the positive side. With some few exceptions the pieces are properly balanced by having a "game" cost/value associated with each one. This means that you can be very competitive without buying all the pieces. Unlike MTG even if you own all the figures you still have to put together a team based on the point level decided by the players.

But even more important than all that is the fact that it is a very interesting and enjoyable game. That coming from someone who doesn't have any collectable games and is not a comic book fan.

Bottom line for me. There are tons and tons of strategies and tactics. Bonus 1: It is fun to play a game based on superheroes. Bonus 2: It still retains the fun of assembling a team somewhat like MTG. Bonus 3: My son who is coming up on 7 will play this game with me. Bonus 4: This game makes for a excellent display... must find a nice display for it.

The one con is... this game will throw your budget out the window.

Note my experience with MTG is limited mostly to a computer game that came out a number of years ago.

Lopsided figure stats.  My Ultra-Rare Spiderman costs more points to play with, and has worse stats/abilities, than the regular rare Spiderman.  Some abilities are simply too powerful, and even with a high points cost, they tend to mop the floor too easily.  A flying character with a good ranged attack dominates almost all the time, in &quot;sealed deck&quot; play.  :P

I like tactical games in general and this has a nice simplicity which makes it easy to get new players into it. Placing all the stats on the pieces is good, but the real beauty and innovation is the way those stats can change as pieces take damage. Very cool.
The multitude of special abilities can bamboozle beginners, but this is manageable by starting with limited and simple figures. Ultimately, these special abilities bring out the other nice aspect of this game - the pre-strategy of putting together a team which works well together, has complementary abilities and suits the battle terrain. In some ways, I enjoy that part more than the simple dicerolling and maneuver.

RATING: 2
This game has almost no tactics what so ever.  Due to the fact that the tactics of movement are reduced to the mind numbing dichotomy of "close in quick and punch" or "stay away and range attack', the ultimate resolution to any game ends up with a cluster of figures and a half hour of die rolling.  The only real strategy the game provides lies in building your "team." Admittedly, there are occasions where combining the heroes special abilities can make for powerful attacks and defenses.  But because those abilities come and go, the chances that you can use the combination you've designed for are rare if at all.
However, the little figures are neat and the collectability aspect I'm sure is appealing to many.  But the game itself leaves me incredibly flat.  The comics I admire the most contain heroes that display characteristics such as intelligence and chess like tactics and those traits aren't represented here. I will stick to reading comics rather than trying to play them.

Great theme, long list of available characters.   Gameplay is like Mage Knight but with all the cumbersome stuff removed.   The sculpts are generally okay but the factory paint jobs are quite poor, sadly.  The game also tends to end a bit abruptly, but that's fixable.   The rules are a mess, and get muddier with each expansion - this thing needs a clear, concise re-write.  Lots of chart reading and some very poor color choices to look up the powers can make this tedious.

RATING: 4
Fair.  Used my typical CC* approach, which is to get a friend who's really into it to make me a deck/team/etc. and loan it to me.  Played one game so far and thought it was okay.  Definitely had that CC* feel, and it was painfully obvious that I was coming into it late in the game -- i.e., the sheer number of powers made it obvious that (like keywords in  Magic ) they had been gradually added over the course of the game to keep veterans interested.  Unfortunately that made it really hard to keep track of what was what for a n00b like me.  Tons of powers to try and keep track of, none of which were terribly obvious or thematic.  E.g., Batman can only outwit people after he's taken a couple of hits.  (What?)

Certainly from a game-design perspective I can get behind Batman or Superman not having access to everything all the time, but thematically it made it feel super-gamey.  And why play a comics-themed game if it's not thematic?

The touted advantage of the Clix-system is that you don't have to have a bunch of cards (etc.) to keep track of all the changing stats over the course of the battle.  My initial impression is that I don't buy it.  I have the most experience in the D&D CCM game, and I found it much easier to just have all the cards in front of me than to constantly be picking up my figures and peering at the numbers on their bases.  And then picking them up again to see if they still had the powers they did last turn.

That being said, I had an okay time playing the game and I'd play it again, although I'd never spend my own money on it.  I do prefer the spread of HeroClix's 2d6-based system to the 1d20 system of D&D minis.  Theme-wise it's a toss-up.  Do I want to feel like the Dead Alewives ("I cast ... MAGIC MISSILE!") or Comic Book Guy ("Worst. Analogy. EVER.")?

RATING: 6
[1 play]  I wasn't that impressed by the clix figures when I first played with them in Mechwarrior.  The whole niftiness was supposed to be that they have the stats on the figure base so you don't have to perpetually look stuff up in tables--but you can't actually SEE the base with its tiny little numbers.  At least I can't.  This became much much better, though, when I realized Heroclix was going to happen on a grid map.  If a character has a defined location in a particular square, you're free to pick them up and look at their stats.  It's not one of those freeform minis games where accidentally moving something a millimeter can change the outcome.  

So Heroclix was actually pretty fun.  It's sort of RPG-like in that you have a team of characters with different strengths and powers who have to work together in combat, but here you're playing them all yourself.  This definitely struck me as a game that would become more fun as you got to know the characters better.

My biggest problem with this game is it addicting and expensive.  Don't bother with the first 10 sets.  Most of the pieces, in those sets, are not very good.  A few are and cost way to much.  
  If you like comics, like my son, then you need this game.  It has it's problems but it is always getting better.

Nothing spectacular here, but some of the minis are way too cool to pass by. And they can be used for custom scenarios in other games, which is just great! Comic geeks might also take a look...

RATING: 8
The basic Heroclix mechanics encourage careful shrewdness without being too complicated, and the miniatures themselves are just fun to handle and make zappity-zap noises with when no one's looking.  That said, it's very difficult to keep in mind the *dozens* of individual character powers in the middle of the game, even with an obligatory cheat sheet handy.  

For casual fans, Heroclix might only deserve a 6 or 7.  But for fans of comics, collecting and battling Heroclix is a delight. Nothing gets my DC fanboy heart a-fluttering like setting my team against a friend's squad of Marvel characters!

I grew up on comics and, in fact, wanted to be a mutant. Sadly, it never happened (unless weight gain is a power). So when Hero Clix came along, I was elated. Here was my chance. The rules are simple.  The play is exciting and imaginative.
Then DC's came out. Then the Indie's. Suddenly, I'm in CCG hell... the money pit vacuum.

RATING: 5
I got caught up in the collectible nature of this at one point. It was great having so many awesome classic super hero and villian figurines. Sadly, the game attached to it all got tiresome quickly, and I can't stomach the thought of ever playing it again. The clix concept is actually really cool, but the dice-fest that's attached to it all is utter garbage. Plus, all the frustrating line-of-sight disputes completely ruined any hope of a fun gaming experience.

Well Heroclix isn't really a board game it is played on a map but its really a figure game. That being said it is may favorite game ever and I have almost every figure that has been printed! Hooorayyy!!!!!! If you have any questions on this shoot me a message.

Lots of good and bad qualities.  Little room to outplay the opponent when either of you has only 1 piece, no matter how powerful it is.  Can devolve into dice throwing fest.  Best when played casual and with house rules to keep it fun.  This game can be an absolute blast with the right people.  The way the game is designed encourages a lot of flexibility, variants, and messing with rules to do fun things.

Bonus points for being able to have Gandalf and Frodo team up with the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles to take down Superman and a Kaiju.  C'mon... that's cool.

Miniatures are variable in quality, but hot damn... some are AMAZING.  Good enough to perch on your desk.

RATING: 4
Played 1 time. My initial impression is good. The theme of a miniatures game, but a simple and efficient (and sufficiently thematic) combat/powers chart right in the fig itself make this about as good as American gaming gets. Not -quite- mass-market (you won't find them in the big stores), and prices for individual figures is outrageous (it is, after all, a fad), but it is an okay game. I don't like the restricted grid maps. Tournament play sounds boring and expensive, but to play themed sets and scenarios friends is fairly fun. [Orig]

This was the game that got me into the hobby of gaming.  I bought my first booster packs in 2002 when it began and collected until WizKids was bought out by Topps.

Fine if you have friends that can get into it, but it really is just an excuse to collect little plastic pre-painted toys, because rules-wise the game becomes a fruit-salad of "green square means this, now red circle means that, unless you use this guy's special ability which means something else, wait you clicked so now it all changes!"

I loved comics as a kid, and this game rekindled my interest in gaming back in 2001 or so when it first came out.  While at the game store buying Clix, I ran into some guy who started talking my ear off about some weird game called Warhammer 40,000.  That guy became one of my best friends, and thus began my full-fledged descent into miniatures and gaming in general.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
Very fond of this one--all your favorite heroes do battle in the streets!

Balance problems abound in the game...and Wizkids has "rotated" old, popular figures out of the tournament environment...so my passion for this one rapidly died off.  Still like playing casual pick-up games but I try not to support companies too heavily that sell you figures or cards and then after a period of time tell you they are unusable.


EDIT:  The Heroscape system with Marvel figures obsoletes the need for this one.  The collectibility (plus the general intolerable arrogance of Wizkids) bumps this down a few notches in my book.

You want skirmishes?  Wait and get Marvel Heroscape.  You want some adventure/storytelling in your game?  Pick up Marvel Heroes.  


EDIT:  I played this with my son not long ago.  I completely forgot how kludgy and sloooow the gameplay is, where only running shot and charging characters are any fun to play.

Even then, the game devolves into, "Let's meet in the middle and punch it out until one of us falls."

I love these figures, man. I really do.  And it's the only reason that I still own these.  Eventually, I need to print out the Heroscape custom cards for some of the heroes I have and permanently graft them into my Heroscape stuff.  Much, much better use for them.

Another, "I have all these great miniatures, but don't really know how to play with them" game.  We've used them here and there and have had some fun, but it's too tedious having to constantly refer to the wordy "special powers".  There's got to be a way to make a reference system that is way more user friendly or a descriptive "card" for each hero that will make this a much more playable game for those of us that love the comic super heros!

RATING: 4
For me finding someone to play is hard. The "blind collecting" and "arms race" is a turnoff.  I have already wasted money on Magic for a lifetime.  CxG & TxG are not viable for me.  The theme is great, luring my son to play.  Mostly go to Gencon and get the cheap pieces we like and try out the game. I have lowered this games score, I want to like this; however now that Heroscape has gone Marvel it plays smoother, looks cooler, has visible boosters, and is less fiddly.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
The rules are a mess, a poorly designed tactical game. It's saving grace is the super hero theme but many aspects of the rules don't reflect comic book battles so I don't know who this is aimed at. 

The complete randomness of the many, many, many dice rolls needed to make an attack, the crit misses, the collectibility, and lifestyle elements of the game just make it more of a headache to get into and play than I think is worth it. More than 2 players often means someone is a kingmaker. Most games don't end so much as both players decided to stop playing. Runaway leader problems. I could go on. 

Seems to be a game for people who first and foremost wanna collect and display plastic. Very shallow and complex gameplay, no real depth. Impenetrable to new players, so much of the meta is accidental (hidden info of the dials) there are more powers available than anyone can reasonably remember. You can't possibly keep track of everything that is going on so you don't really make informed choices in battle. 

Set decay makes older pieces irrelevant, constant rule changes make the errata impossible to follow unless you're a lifer specifically dedicated to playing just this game. The game is a house of cards, built on quicksand and slowly sliding downhill, constantly trying to iterate and change all of it's rules on the fly, in vain attempts to save it from utter collapse. 

I think it makes  just enough money to justify it's existence and force out any better super hero miniature games from entering the sphere.

Played a couple of times and thought it was interesting and so bought a 100 figure mix pack on e-bay and have never had a chance to play since.  It's super-hero theme seems to be too "childish" for the adult gamers I play with so it doesn't get played even though I think there is some fun to be had there.

This game is not only a lot of fun it is very simple to get the basics. Skip all the details about throwing, super powers, and the like and this is fun for all ages. It's been helping my kids get faster at simple math and adding in their heads. Short adding and subtracting and when it comes to building a team we pull out an abacus, they read the point values, and we tally it up. It's great, simple, a lot of fun for us all and they love the models for toys too.

Purchased/Played Nov 08 - My first foray into Heroclix.  I enjoy the changing powers as heroes are damaged.  Similar to D&DM, but probably superior due to this and also the fact that you don't need to track stats or damage separately.
Nov 08 - Picked up a case of Icon Boosters, Sinister Boosters and Indy Starters and Danger Room.
Dec 08 - Expanding my collection and greatly enjoying this game.  Opening boosters is fun.  Collecting is fun. Making a team is fun. Playing is fun.  Just goodness all around.  I've also managed to pick up a lot more sets on the cheap.  Great game. 8.5/10

Not really bad. I actually like the whole pre-painted miniatures approach, and the sculpts are good in general. The game system itself is not very deep. I suppose this may be a bit unfair as I played a lot of the original MageKnight, which was a much more interesting system.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Overall it seems to have less tactical depth than sister games Mechwarrior and MageKnight did.  Yet, with newer sets from NECA more possibilities arise from the Special Powers on the cards.  At first I did not like the printed grid maps.  It seemed to limit strategy, but I can see where it makes adoption by new players easier than a blank table top.

Powers, as with all WizKids clix games, are of variable utility.  Outwit, Psychic Blast, Probability Control, and HyperSpeed seem to be of much more use than most other powers.  This seems to make tactics nearly the same every game.  Heavily armored pieces are easily countered by cheap pieces with the Outwit ability, for example.

In any game collectibility stinks.  I just can't stand the format.  I'd love to able to buy a prepacked box of X-men, Avengers, Justice League, etc. with a few appropriate villains maybe thrown in to the mix.  The Fast Forces packs are decent move in this direction.  I'm hoping for more in this format.

Since NECA has taken over the line, sets seem to show improvement.  They have also released a small number of non-blind packs like I mentioned above, but not nearly as much variety as I would like.  Another improvement over the Wizkids line is that there aren't 3 different versions of every scuplt just to pad set figure count.  Scuplt and paint are also much better than most Wizkids sets save for a few notable sets like Fantastic Forces.  Quality has gone up, as has price per figure.  At least they seem to have kept pace.   

Where the game starts to be enjoyable for me, is if you can play for fun, and if you have a fondness or nostalgia for the characters/teams, etc. Playing in theme, with known alliances against arch enemies was actually pretty fun, surprisingly.  For example Fantastic Four VS. Doom and henchmen, or X-men vs. magneto was much more fun than each person playing the same munchkin min-max super rare figures from the latest set just to dominate a tourney. Those past experiences with other WizKids games almost kept me from ever giving this game a real chance.  I say all that to say it really is heavily group dependent.  If you're with a bunch of whiney cheating dinks, I suppose any game would stink, though.  I'm very fortunate to game with who I do. 

It's worth playing for casual play with friends who can be good sports.  Whereas, it's a near complete waste in a tourney setting, and it only gets worse with whiners, cheaters, rules abusers, etc.

This was the first miniatures game that I decided to buy into. The concept was good, but since I was coming from an RPG background, the rules seemed awful to me.

RATING: 2
I have played clix from the very beginning up until about 4 months ago.  I've finally had enough.  The rules have become extremely complicated, often having to refer to a 200+ page "player's guide" to decipher how abilities interact with each other or verify figure errata.  Since the addition of resources, the game has become all about playing these under costed, over powered game elements on EVERYTHING.  And you can't simply ignore them because 90% of the players use them.

The collectible model that WK is using has become unsustainable.  The current War of Light chase figures go for over $100 each on the secondary market... and there's 8 of them!  It's impossible to be a collector of this "collectible" game anymore thanks to the company's love of artificial rarity schemes.

And WizKids themselves are a complete joke of a company.  They have ZERO customer service.  There's no phone number or email where you can contact them.  Questions or comments that aren't high praise of their products are immediately deleted from their Facebook page (and the user banned from posting).  They refuse to replace things like LEs and chase figures (the only figures of any value) when they are broken or incomplete.  The company treats it's customers as nothing more than open wallets, but have no desire to interact with or listen to their customers.

It was a nice ride for awhile, but the game isn't worth it anymore... for so many different reasons.

The best way to simulate comic book slug-fests that I've seen.  My only issue with it is the move or fight mechanic, but other than that, the game has few flaws.  I'm not really a comic fan or a mini's battle player, so I can't really rate it higher.  If you are a fan of comics or want a mini's rule system that fast and fun, this is a good bet for you.

This is a good game with not too complex rules to simulate the battles from the comics. It moves quickly as the heroes and villains use their various superpowers in combat. A modest number of core powers come through in a way that makes them seem uniquely suited for each individual character.  If you like comics (or maybe just the idea of comics and superheroes if you're no longer reading them) you really should try this game out. Can get pretty hairy at tournament level.

I really wanted to like this game. I love the figures and the idea behind the game. After Mage Knight, I was excited Wizkids could pull this off.

They haven't. The gameplay requires more errata than is reasonable. Figs seem poorly designed (stat-wise) and the same problem that plagues Mage Knight haunts this game - the rare ultra-powerful-game-breaking figs are to difficult to get!

This is absolutely my favorite game, and I have a hard time playing anything else in its place these days. Being a superhero fan since childhood, this game is the perfect combination of my two favorite things: superheroes and gaming. The addition of more properties (Lord of the Rings, Yu-Gi-Oh, TMNT, etc.) only adds to the depth and variety of a game that already has an almost infinite array of combinations. The fact that I can play a team of Batman, an Elvish Archer, and a Pacific Rim kaiju makes me happy in a way I'll never find anywhere else. Love it!

RATING: 6
 I've had two plays so far.
 Love the theme. But unfortunately the game suffers from some quite a few issues. First of all, the minis are just ok, with some of them having casting issues (Storm from X-Men was literally faceless, as if she had an argument with a speeding train or something...), or paint issues. The maps are made of paper and the premium ones cost around 18-20 euros. I understand that they are made of paper so that the cost remains low, but the artwork on the maps is AWFUL, I'm sure they could have come up with something much better.
 Gameplay wise: The rulebook is really badly written, the simplest thing is explained in the worst way possible, and I have to say that I am a wargamer, so I am acustomed to complex rules, but these were some poorly written rules. The gameplay itself...hmmm... the idea of clix bases is wonderful but... characters constantly changing special powers is really confusing to say the least and you cannot plan a strategy. It is also not thematic and the fact that only in the post 2016 (I think) version of the game they decided to include all the different powers on the character cards so that you know what to expect-until then the powers were revealed to you only when you turned the dial-, is game breaking. In my plays, we ended up face to face, rolling dice trying to figure out what power had changed and what didn't. Also the different itterations of characters just for the sake of the collectible format just doesn't make sense. I mean, I have a version of superman that costs (a measure of how strong he is) 90 points, and you have Rhino with 128 ??? Seriously ??? I also didn't like the lack of interesting scenarios.
 All in all good idea, but poorly executed. I was pretty disappointed, I might play it again just because I like comic heroes, but I will try out the much superior from what I've seen, Marvel and DC miniature game from Knight Models.

The rules are utterly incoherent, confusing & counter-intuitive. It does have a fun factor what with all the powers and superheroes but the design is really turning me off.

This is a great game. The new design of the dials makes them easier to turn and is a massive improvement. 

The lack of starter sets these days makes getting into the game difficult. Also, the superpowers can be a little annoying having to check the table to see which colour in which slot does what, especially when no starter sets means physical copies of the stat sheet are hard to come by. 

Otherwise, it's a great game.

My most-played game for many years.  The company puts out too much product, and occasional pieces are ridiculously overpowered or undercosted, but there is still great fun in bashing little plastic superheroes against one another.  Playing with keywords and without vehicles and equipment is recommended.

I've played this since 2002. The game has changed so much since then; the addition of special powers, traits, prime figures, vehicles, special game-breaking objects, switch-clix (?), and team dials (?) have bogged down what was once a really fun and straightforward collectible game. I forsee another hiatus in the next year or so...

I really like this game.  Lots of strategy involved in building your team, while being highly tactical in the actual play of the game.

It's amazing how well the Clix system causes each character to play like their comic book representation.  This fact alone will make any comic fan want to go out and buy a ton of figures (must... resist... urge... to buy... more). 

With the game being as old as it is now (though still active), it is really easy to buy only the figures you want, instead of making blind purchases through "booster packs".  I've found a ton of older figs for really cheap on both ebay (for lots) and miniaturemarket.com (for singles).

NECA has taken over production of the game after the downfall of the game's creator WizKids (though they still call themselves WizKids). I'm really excited with what NECA has done so far and for the direction they're taking the game. The quality of the new figs that are coming out is insanely good. My only hope is that they give their HorrorClix brand the same love they're giving HeroClix.

RATING: 5
This game is better then Overpower CCG ever was. It's a fun game that can at times capture the comic book experience.  However, the game just drags because you're constantly looking up powers and looking at how powers interact with one another.  I just became too cumbersome, especially as they added more and more and MORE figures and powers. I can't bring myself to play anymore.

I have hundreds and hundreds of these clix, they were truly addictive to buy. At one time they were pretty cool to look at but miniatures nowadays are vastly superior looking.

RATING: 4
A comic store I went to shortly after college used to give these figures away loose...one per purchase of 20 bucks or more.  I had a comic habit of about 20 bucks a week, so I got one every week.  I have a whole bunch of them now and I've only played the game once.  I have no starter set so I don't know the rules offhand, and the way they were explained to me made them seem very confusing.  I couldn't keep track of what all the color-coding meant and had to consult a chart repeatedly.  Ah well...I really WANT to like this game since the pieces are so cool.  I'm TRYING to put aside my collectible game bias, but its hard to do, especially after Heroscape released a Marvel Expansion.  The 'scape figures make 'clix look like crap.

Update: the continued rules changes, addition of new game mechanics, and additional rarities for pieces have made this an unbalanced mess.

Original comments with 7.5 rating: Originally this was a fairly straightforward game that allowed surprising depth in the teams you could build and the strategies you could use.  Subsequent sets have made the rules increasingly more complicated.  The vast proliferation of "exclusive" figures that require you to attend a comic convention, buy a subscription to a magazine, buy 12 boosters at a time, etc. will make you cringe at the amount of money it costs to keep current with the figures.  Tournament play has exposed how easily exploited the rules are, and only a handful of strategies are viable in that type of setting.  The collectible nature and potential for "power gaming" keep this otherwise great game from getting a 9 or 10 in my book.

RATING: 6
Way to damn expensive. I HATE blind buying!

A decent superhero battle game though. Worth it if you can find good deals (the only way I'll buy figures for it).

I love, LOVE, the idea of the 'clix' wheel, but find it to impractical from a user interface standpoint when playing (and, I have great eyes). It just doesn't function all that well, but it's a brilliant idea.

This really is a decent, but light, game to embark upon if you want to square two heroes (or a hero vs. villain) off each other.

A brilliant idea that could have used a bit more playtesting/balancing and a better user interface (just a bigger dial that's easier to turn in truth).

The best super hero battle game I've played since the battle royals we used to have in the Marvel Heroes RPG back in the day.

3D game based on hero vs hero combat. Abilities change with damage, and you track it by turning the base. It's a decent game that doesn't quite match the level of excitement it suggests. More importantly, there were too many characters to collect per set, many in three levels of strength, and that led to game burn out.

BIG PLUS: DC/Marvel/Image/etc are all represented, 3D
PLUS: decent mechanics (not great but decent)
BIG MINUS: not super exciting, cost heavy

Being a comic book fan, I had to get them for the minis. An incredible range of characters from the Marvel and DC Universes. You'll find the biggies like Spidey, Supes and Bats right along side with b-list heroes like Moon Knight, Dr. Midnight, and Havok.

The detail on the minis range from mediorce to incredible.

I had a lot of fun with this when it first came out. You had to make up a few house rules to avoid a few hassles but once you had a set of rules everyone could agree on, this was fun. Unfortunately it got a little ridiculous with the different sets and some of the heroes stats being so strong. Then it turned into a "lets bring in the same guys every time and kick butt". If you can manage to avoid the collect everything and only play with the strongest, in other words, try playing themes, you can have a lot of fun with this.

I didn't care about this game until I started playing City of Heroes (MMOG).  When I finally started playing I got hooked and so did my friends.  Deducted a point for neglect/lack of Indy expansions.  They are currently making Indy tournament illegal but I don't see signs of a new set.  There are SO many possibilities out there that need to be implemented (The Tick, Blade of the Immortal, any cool manga characters, Conan, Spawn, etc.)  I only play for fun, though, so their capitalistic retiring of old lines doesn't affect me.

Love the concept and love the genre. The only dissapointment is that it is strictly combat so it makes 'super intelligent' characters very weak. Reed Richards and the Beast really don't resemble the characters since they are primarily super in their intelligence. I like the push system too to recognize that characters have the ability to use mind over matter. Great afternoon filler but not sure the collectibility is needed after a certain number have been acheived. Also, the colors make color blind people suffer and limits the ability for expansion in the future. Wish there was a way to incorporate symbols without confusing the issue. This game would benefit greatly from an RPG style campaign book. I'm amazed that one hasn't been created already since marketing is the number one talent of the collecting industry.

RATING: 6.5
A fun game that I just can't seem to really get into - at least not in the way i'm into Axis and Allies Minis (and I even read comics). 

I feel the game is best (and the most fun) when players stay true to the comics and only fight battles that would occur in them - though a foray into the "what if" is nice once in awhile.

I would not play this competetively.

To be good at this game I think you really have to have an understanding of your opponents characters, and know what powers they'll have further down their dial (wich has been made somewhat easier with the introduction of stat cards, see below). 

Because each character is unique the game can get more complicated then I feel a superhero game need be. The variety of powers leads to some rather interesting (and sometimes complex) interactions between figures. This tends to lead to slower player turns, and gives the game a very tactical, brain burning feel. Variety of powers does tend to put an emphasis on building a balanced team - but at the same time you can still do a lot of cheesy power combos.

I dislike that powers are represented by a color. It is to hard for me to remember what each means. It is also hard to analyze a character at a glance since you have to click through the dial.

In the newer expansions, Wizkids includes stat cards that go with each figure. These cards basically list a character's powers so you don't have to look up a color on the generic power chart. Figures also now have their own unique "white" powers (as they're called). White powers are explained on a figure's card as they're now specific to that character. Often a white power will be a variation of an existing power (extending the range of a certain power or letting a figure use two of the generic attack powers at once) while other times they are powers that reflect what that hero or villian is really all about. The white powers are great from a thematic standpoint (a plus in my book) but could lead to some complicated interactions between other powers as discussed above.

I also dislike how each character is represented by 3 different pieces with varying point costs and sometimes a 4th Unique piece (I believe they have stopped doing this in the newer sets).  The collectibility of a game in which you are essentially recieving multiples of the same Hero annoys me greatly. This is contrasted with a game like Axis and Allies Minis where having multiples of the same figure is a good thing, because the figures represent generic troops and vehicles, and not a single specific person. I am aware that you can have multiples of the same non-unique figure in a match, but frankly that is unthematic and in my opinion lame. I'd prefer if all iterations of a specific hero had a single piece with one cost value. I do not want multiples of a specific iteration of hero with varying stats based upon the figure's point cost. 

I have no problems with having various iterations of a figure. For example I like how their are versions of Superman that focus on different aspects of his strengths based on what Comic the figure is based on (Kindgome Come or JLA Superman for example). This is fine since they are essentially representing something different, and unique (and given the state of the DC multiverse I suppose it makes sense thematically)...

From a gameplay standpoint, I don't know if I like the pushing mechanic. I'd prefer if the game was faster paced and had no pushing like Horrorclix. Pushing leads to interesting tactical decisions though (Should I push, and take damage to pull of this attack, or wait and try to set up a different attack? etc). Regarding pushing: One complaint I have with the game is that no tokens are included in the game to mark what figures have taken actions. I'm sorry, but that's lame. 

Still I wouldn't call this game bad and I enjoy the matches my friend and I have.

There are several starters sets out there that are pretty cool and some other boxed sets from Horrorclix that are cool as well. Hellboy and the BPRD, The Legion of Superheros, the X Men/Danger Room pack, the Aliens Pack, Predator Pack, Alien Queen, Sentinel, etc...

The figures from the newest sets are light years ahead in quality from some of the older stuff. The new figures are pretty nice.

I hope Wizkids does an Avengers team starter. 

One day i'll write a review of this game.

There is a lot to like about Heroclix. I really like all of the abilities, slugging it out with your favorite superheroes, and the team building.  What's not to like is the collectibility. I dropped too much money on this game, and ended up giving away all of my figures for a few board games, because I just couldn't do it anymore.

RATING: 9
Super fun, but it can be a money pit. I researched the game first, and realizing it was a minis game somewhat similar to Star Wars minis, I decided to enter cautiously. These games are designed to evolve over time, with ever changing rules, with fairly expensive expansions that lose their potency over time, and suck your money away quickly if you try to keep up. Having fallen into the endless pit before, I opted to jump into this game with a new approach. I would buy a few different starter sets, and expansion packs, buy some additional minis online that I really wanted, a slew of maps to play on, then call it good. Essentially I purchased a 'snap shot' of the game, based on 2013 rules, and I don't plan to expand beyond that. Great game to have a 'sample' of with maybe a 80-100 decent minis to pick from, but otherwise a vast money pit.

The collectible game that currently has ahold of my wallet. It's fun, innovative, and frustrating in equal parts. Power creep is a thing, cheese players are a thing.

Changed my rating to a 6 from a 10. The 2017 Rulebook totally hoses this game; power gamers and rules lawyers have ruined it for the rest of us. The rulebook contains an entire page describing the difference between "can't use" and "lost". You need to be a post-graduate English student to properly parse the rules. Any game which requires a paragraph in the rules defining the phrase "for the rest of the game" is irretriveably lost down the rabbit hole (or stuck up its own ass - ass as in rectum, not donkey. See clarification of differences on page 27).

The game plays much like a miniatures game, but without the measure-and-move system or the constant consultation of hit charts. Rather, most of the vital statistical information is directly on the base of the characters, which can be rotated as characters take damage from hits.
Since we're talking super heroes here, each character has special abilities and powers, which give the game its 'comic' book feel. While these powers are listed on separate charts, sometimes the interaction of these powers can cause confusion. Official FAQ can be found at the Wiz Kids website.

I rate CCGs and their expandable cousins (LCGs, etc.) on this basis: "I will likely never invest in one again, but assuming that someone else hands me a deck here's what I think of the game."

I've played this exactly once, and I found it to be similar to D&D Miniatures: flavorful and enjoyable, with solid mechanics (especially the tough choice of how to use your limited actions), but unlikely to capture my interest since it's collectible.

On pure gameplay, it's more like a 6 or a 7, but the CMG aspect, plus the fact that WizKids minis generally have much poorer paint jobs than WotC minis, pulls it down to a 5.

It was a wonderful concept and executed so well in its earlier sets, but the powercreep caught up to it and the many many times they had to change the rules was terribly frustrating.

Great game concept. It seems each expansion is better sculpted, better painted than the preceding one. My wife actually enjoys this game. I think this game would rate better personally if it weren't collectable.

Maybe the most complicated rule set of all time. The amount of randomness makes the best player only win slightly more than not. Also since you build your own team, the majority of the game is decided before you make the first move. It's not awful to play casually, if all your opponents only have a handful of figures so there's a lot less metagaming.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
I only collect \ play the Street Fighter clix, and a few others.  I got the complete SF set only because the figures looked amazing(!), and I grew up with SF.  I didn't even plan on playing the actual game, but then I read the rules and gave it a shot.

The rules are very simple, but surprisingly they can emulate a pretty thematic battle (at least as far as SF is concerned).  I was hoping to branch out more into the Marvel \ DC clix, but I find that certain rules \ set-ups are a bit too simplistic, and that they break the theme a bit, at least for me.

If I am going to play with superheroes, I want them to be as thematic as possible.  For instance, I find it a bit odd that superman has super strength one minute, then he loses it, and gets it back again.  I also find it odd you can have 2 (or more) batmans on the same team, etc.

As far as the SF set is concerned though, I think it is well balanced and fun to play with.  That, and the models are amazing!  I rate the SF set an 8.5 probably.

Could there be a better concept? Who doesnt want to have a free-for-all, comic-book style? When played as a friendly game, this game is awesome. On a competetive level all the bad things about this game stand out....where people build teams around gimmicks (FEAT cards). Too much of this game is about the alpha-strike and gimmick combos where teams are built to exploit the rules. Again, this game can be great or a total mess, it just depends on who you play with.

[COLOR=#FF3300]The biggest flaw for me is not being able to explore this game on a deeper level. This is an extremely complicated system with probably the most convoluted rules I have ever encountered. But it's also amazing how much creativity it encourages. I probably shouldn't have gone off and bought so much stuff, because really, we don't often sit down to play it, so most of the time it feels that luck is the biggest factor, which is untrue, because there's a community out there that shows how much of thought process can go in to build a good team that tries to balance between strategy and luck.[/COLOR]

Ahh miniature games. I usually don't like them for so many reasons. I hate movement and line of sight. This one used a grid so that was fixed! Although hexes would have been better. But it still had the problem of dullness. Your opponent sets up his 5 or so figures.. all of which you have seen before and know exactly what they do. Then he starts playing and does exactly what he always does. Yawn. Fun for a while.

This game being collectible means the gameplay is fundamentally broken.  The process of figuring out what combinations are better is a puzzle not a game.  Sitting by yourself constructing a team is the definition of solitary play (a puzzle).

Beyond that the business model of collectible games is deplorable.  It is a form of gambling targeted towards children.  It adds no benefit to the gameplay is done specifically to milk as much money from people as possible.

Heroclix can be lame and expensive, but having giant power battles with crazy heroes from every universe is too fun. Up until the white square rules started to be printed on the dials the mechanics of heroclix were super tight. The game is still fun now, but I find too much of those rules are now caught up in their own explanations and often seem mystifying.

Lastly, I understand wizkids has failed at preventing power-sinking, or what ever the term is for games where older figures become weaker in comparison to new ones. That and old figures are removed from tourney play which is unfair to less affluent players. Rares and Super rares also make the game unfeasible for casual players to have their dream teams.

Aah, another complicated game where the rules are incredibly simple, but there are a million add-ons which make the game incredibly hard to learn properly and follow. 

I like playing casually, although I understand that the cool combos require the cool characters, which I do not have. I do not mind the luck factor at all, since it can be mitigated a little by the powers. Also, there is the team-building aspect which I think is cool. The characters have different roles, which makes for interesting decisions.  

This game has one of those "haunting" qualities, which makes me go back to it from time to time as expansions are released, and it's usually a fun time!

My love for HeroClix fluctuates. The bits sure are neat (even if the paint jobs can be somewhat embarassing) and the powers interesting, but the whole  "deathmatch" premise of the game is just pointless. This is especially problematic for the Indy set (my favourite): the miniatures mainly represent adventurers, investigators, agents, not super-powered fighting machines. Having them fight to the finish on an arena is not only silly, it's bordering on blasphemy! Lobster Johnson wouldn't just stand there, blasting away! He'd do something clever!
To really make it worthwhile, HeroClix needs a fair bit of extra work: designing maps, orchestrating set pieces, coming up with variable victory conditions, that sort of thing. I've just finished designing a set of modular 3D rooms and corridors (drawn by hand and coloured with Photoshop) to make more interesting maps, and I'm currently dreaming up all sorts of clever scenarios for the little plastic guys.
It takes a bit of commitment to squeeze the fun out of HeroClix, but in the end I think it deserves the effort.

(OK, I lied. It's been months since I started 'upgrading' HeroClix, and I haven't played a single game. I guess I must adjust my rating...)

Superheroes represented as minatures, with a rotatable base to show levels of hit points and abilities. Very neat concept, but too much luck in rolling to hit and inflicting damage. However, I have only played once, and it was a team game, so I'm willing to give this another chance.

Played couple games only. Rating not definite. (As Collectible game it gets better the more money you invest in it. Seems too expensive for me.) Game mechanics also didn't seem very good.

RATING: 5
Very simple skirmish with average quality miniatures. You probably have to be a superhero fanboy to enjoy this. There's just no substance at all mechanicswise. 

The basic idea of the Clix system is nice, though: If you can memorize the color coding system for the special powers, all the information you need can be found on the bases of the miniatures. Also, there's no need to keep track of hit points, since the dial handles all the bookkeeping.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
A very satisfying game system not without it's difficulties (collectible, seemingly unplaytested rules, endless needless clarifications and errata, horrible editing, nepotism, etc)  However, it portrays Superhero combat better than any system yet.  The figs are nicely sculpted and painted.  Deep, multi-layered strategy.  And most importantly to me, the players are 99 44/100% great to play with.  We're all just comic book geeks who love superheros.

 I used to be an avid comics reader, so I really liked the game at launch, but the limited depth of the mechanics (it was quickly obvious what the useful figs were, and what the useless figs - and there was a lot of them - were), and most of all the collectible aspect of the game made me give up.

Great game for comic fans!  There are thousands of characters to build your force with so you can create a limitless variety of teams & strategies.  The figures use progressive dials which is a great way for characters to show injuries, rage, new powers, lost powers, secret identities, etc.  The newer sets brought some very cool special abilities but also some very annoying power creep.  It's a collectible miniatures game so it can be expensive to get into.

Purchased from 2002-present for an amount that I am wary to even ponder...

I can take or leave the basic Heroclix combat system, but it's plastic models of superheroes! And with some great sculpts. FWIW, I am confident that I have the largest DC Heroclix collection in Tunbridge Wells  :-)

De todas formas lo que yo puntúo es el juego en sí y como tal le doy esa puntuación, que seguramente le subiré. GRANDÍSIMO JUEGO, UN JUEGAZO.

RATING: 8
Unfortunately, this game doesn't receive the love I think it should on BGG.  When this game came out in 2002, it was essentially a super-hero themed Mage Knight.  The game has evolved dramatically since then, far outliving its predecessor.  The character and power combinations allow for limitless combinations, and the core mechanics have been refined to the point that this is now a premier competitive game.

Loved the figures and got uite a collection. The game seems a tad predictable though: most to hit rolls are 5/6/7 which is usually very achievable with 2d6.

Plan on trying the game again using a d12 for to hit and 6 on a d6 for a knockback, may revise score if this leads to a less predictable bots of combat.

RATING: 7
Pros- great selection of various mainstream comic 
characters to play with. To some degree it manages to
replicate the abilities of the various heroes and villains.
Cons- sculpts are hit or miss, with just as many horribly
ugly characters as well crafted ones. The rules are
cumbersome and you'll find yourself constantly looking up
the powers correlating to colors on the dial. If you
don't memorize your characters abilities, you'll often
have to lift them up to determine which color is on the
dial. Newer clix are much better than older ones, making
the older sets mostly useless.
*update: A lot has changed since my original 2009 comments. I've increased the Heroclix score since the game has become more fun in some ways. Sculpts got way better, the new bases are nice, tons of new sets and special powers add so much to the game. I also love the Star Trek Clix...

A good miniatures game that isn't too rule heavy. There are a lot of rules but it's not as bad as the usual mini-wargame. There are a huge assortment of characters to choose from but mainly superheroes. More sets are to come out and your "ultimate" battles can come to life.

Bought Heroclix X-Men box with a Sinister Booster pack to start the boys collection.  Basic game is simple and fast-paced.  The Special Abilities take time to learn.

  Lots of strategy and Lots of figures to choose from. The only downside is the learning curve on how to play the game especially to beginners. With a bunch load of powers, abilities and rules, it could take around an hour or more to learn and understand the mechanics of the game, which can be stressful to kids and the like. But once they get a hold of it, the fun is unlimited.

Loved it for a while, then they kept changing the rules. And you always felt like you were going to break the pieces turning the dial.

The Clix innovation (building a unit's chart into its base in the form of a wheel that can be clicked down as damage is taken) is clever.  The powers are fiddly, with tiny splotches of color cross-referenced on a chart to find what the ability does (and a different chart for Marvel, DC, independents, etc.).  The whole chart lookup is what the clickable bases avoided, why impose it anyway?

Geez, how to rate Heroclix? I have an abundance of love for the subject matter, and I spent an insane amount of money on it with a really good friend when it first came out. The 'clix design is super nifty and we had a blast playing with the starters and a few boosters. As others here have stated, though, I liked it a lot better when it was a small, quirky set. The insane collectibility aspect, incessant rules bloat, the endless clarifications and errata, the lack of real, comic book-y scenarios (every stock game is a deathmatch), the game-breaking chase rares and promos... this could've been so much more. The fact that themed superhero teams (e.g. the X-Men, the Avengers, etc.) still underperform mismatched but min-maxed teams is another red flag that the designers care little about fidelity to the source material and more about their Clix-ian Empire.

The figures themselves aren't totally awful. The newer sculpts are more elaborate but just as crude as the old ones and the paint job quality still ranges from "Hey! Not bad for a pre-painted collectible!" to "Did you pull that out of your nose?" That said, larger models like Galactus and the Sentinel are crazy cool and it's a shame that Wizkids opted for quantity over quality.

I ended up giving my (still) really good friend all of my figures, but picked up a starter for $3.00 at an EB ust for old time's sake. Who knows? Maybe I will break it out again someday. (Although with Monsterpocalypse's stranglehold on my tabletop right now, that's unlikely in the forseeable future.)

This might be my favorite game ever. The collectability of it always drove me nuts as well as the power creep and some inaccuracies of characters. With that being said, not having played heroscape it remains a fantastic game. Over the last 5+ years the errata and FAQ and expansions have grown to where I'm not sure of all the rules anymore. The meta game I find to be no fun as it isn't as accurate as the scenario and themes. The feat cards allow you to "adjust" a character to what you feel they might really be like. Wonderful system with all the information on the base.

While I enjoy the basic premise of Heroclix, the deluge of new sets and the overly competitive nature of the game now (it seems like the only time I play is in a tournament, so I'm only going to record the non-tourney plays), I'm losing my interest. Fast.

Love this game, love the fact that there's broad-based organized play.  The community of players is great.  It seems like a major cross-over for players that play Magic The Gathering.  Especially great if you like comic book characters.  Also great if you like 1v1 tactical battling with lots of depth.

Infinity Challenge and Hypertime picked up at a thrift store.

Ok, so maybe this game IS actually better than a 6 but its collectable nature is a big problem for me. I love the sets I have and will probably not pick up more. A game that is always full of laughs.

As a game really it's about a 8. If you're a comic book geek, it's a 10. If you factor in the cost of a collectible game, and the rate of expansions, it's a 5.  Also, it seems they are cleverly amping up the power on the figures so that the older ones are useless.

On a casual, or controlled competitive level, this game is a blast to play, fulfilling all your dream combat matches between heroes and villains. The rating goes down for hardcore competitive play, where the player with the best figures, not the best strategy or tactics, usually wins the match.

En un nivel casual, o de competencia controlada, este juego es muy divertido, cumpliendo todos tus enfrentamientos soñados entre héroes y villanos. La calificación baja en modo competitivo hardcore, donde el jugador con las mejores figuras, no la mejor estrategia o tácticas, usualmente gana el enfrentamiento.

I've been waiting a really long time for a truly GOOD superhero game...and this is almost it.  The minis are nice, and the game plays well.  However, the pacing is very slow, and it really doesn't have a good comicky feel.I think I'll just be converting all my HeroClix figures to Heroscape!

Fun game if you want some super hero action. I get out of most collectable games when they have their first expansion as that’s the best time to cash out usually. So I don’t know what the game is like these days.

Much better than when it originally came out. A lot of strategy and feels more like a board game than any other collectible game.

It is just so expensive to collect and hard to teach compared to other games.

Excellent balance of theme and strategic gameplay. A must have for fans of comics. Criticisms: Some characters just arent as playable as others and the gameplay sometimes feels too "slow" for superhero game. Recommend playing for the fun of it and not get too caught up in team building or the perfect combo/strategy.

RATING: 8
If you are into comics and you like a game where stategry, use of skills and suprise comes into play - then Hero Clix is for you. Never two games alike, the figures are detailed, but clearly mashine-painted.

The beauty of this system is that the rule for the figure is on the base - no need for books and tables to figure out what any given figure can do.

The overall rules of the game are very simple and easy to learn - and once you know the skills for each symbol you can play for hours and hours.

Only real drawback is that it will eventually cost you alot of money, because you will want to expand your collection and have to buy random boosterpacks to get the ones you need.

This was fun for a while, then it became "collectible" (I suppose it always was, but when that aspect started to hit me, I lost interest).  It was always more fun with a comic-accurate theme (to me) instead of KC Green Lantern plus a bunch of feat cards.  Everyone I played with, however, saw it as a money pit and wanted the expensive or gimmick teams.  It wasn't fun for me when KC Flash teamed up with Ultimate Iron Man and Deathstroke.  I think this is a better game in "real" terms than it is in my world.  I just personally got burned out with it and the tournament crowd.  I imagine that with a group of fun gamers playing casually this could be fun again, but I'm not likely to ever test that theory.

Building your team is half (or more) the game. Sometimes it's even the funner half. For the same amount of tactical play, length, and dice-reliance, I would rather play Blood Bowl. But when I don't have a choice, this makes a good substitute.

Furthermore, you can complain all you want about collectible games being cash-sinkholes (and I don't have to, because a friend with some connections has pretty much every figure ever and I play for free), but if this wasn't a collectible game, there's no way they could ever put out anywhere near the thousands of figures that they have. And we'd never know who'd win in a fight: Ambush Bug or Stilt Man.

I've been collecting this game off and on since the beginning.  I don't play it anymore though due to issues in the gameplay.  When it played like a comic book battle, it could be an awesome experience.  Unfortunately the game is cursed with heavily imbalanced powers and abilities as well as an overemphasis on the company's part on competitive tournament play.  To make matters worse, there are no limits on just what figures can be used together which tends to make the average game less about comic books and more about maxing out your piecemeal "teams" to the Nth degree.

The game still produces some awesome figures though.

RATING: 9
The best superhero miniature combat game ever.  I think the early years were better as the game was nice and streamlined.  Later elements can bog it down, but some do still add to the game.  Overall a great game.
I have some that I might be willing to trade or sell if interested.  Mostly older sets and mostly Marvel.

Being a comicbook fan is probably the reason I bought my first pack.  I am predominately a DC fan, tho my husband likes Marvel better.  If I wax poetic about heroes this would be a really long comment.  Have played a few times, but this really needs a block of time set aside and people who can get into the spirit.

RATING: 8
I've been interested in this game since it was announced.  Had promo figures before it was even released...  I think that to really enjoy the game you need to like (maybe love) the theme of comic book heroes.  I think if I stripped that away I'd call it a 6 or so, but because the theme is very much integral to the enjoyment of it for me, it is an 8.  It is just plain fun to play Hulk v. Superman.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
I wasn't as impressed with this system as with Heroscape. I have limited plays with both so I'm no expert but the Heroscape landscape adds more to the game than the paper maps of Heroclix. Having your own characer sheets for powers and such is also a big plus. I do like the collectible and the details of the Heroclix figures though. I would pick a set up at a good price for that aspect alone.

I like superheroes, some of the models are great and I really like the dial idea. However, the gameplay is not very dynamic in that the optimal strategy is often a very dull one to play out and people I played would struggle to remember all the powers so felt I had an unfair advantage and they couldn't get as much out of it without constant reference to the rules sheets.

I started playing Heroclix about a month ago (as of writing this on May 14th, 2012) and I was surprised at how much I ended up liking it. Partially, the environment in which I first played was wonderful. It was at my local comic/game store Wizard's Asylum during their Heroclix night. Everyone was super nice and patient and would explain things to me during the match. One guy even told me what to do on the last round (timed matches) that would give me a really great chance of beating him. And I did. Then I was given a bunch of HeroClix from various people who like to help new players get a start on their collection and because their super community-focused. Every week, people will give up prizes if they know there's a new player who they would rather have the prize or etc. First, they're concerned about having fun. It's like the tournament aspect is just to add flavor to something they'd be doing no matter what (with the exception of the official Infinity Gauntlet tournaments. Which they're still super nice and helpful, but take more seriously as far as rules go. For obvious reasons.)
But I can definitely see this game being meh if you play with the wrong people. Luckily, I have a good group of right people.

It is admirable that they've managed to streamline four-colour combat to this very simple system - but it is too streamlined, in the end, and feels restrictive to anyone who has played Champions or DC Heroes.

I grew up reading nearly every Marvel comic that came out in the silver age (an age when every comic had a new villain and story -- and when there was a battle in every issue).  This beer & pretzels slug-a-thon is exactly what I would have lived for as a kid.  However, (1) collectability, (2)the dreaded underpriced/overpowered figures that an expansion will surely introduce, and (3) a constantly changing set of ruling (what non-historical BPV system doesn't constantly change it's rules in a futile attempt to balance the un-balanceable?) will ultimately ruin it for me. But until then I'm pushing around little men and making sound effects again (and drooling over the potential 100s of Marvel characters the expansions will add to the game).  Update:  with enough expansions the game has reached the point of unbalanced figures.  You can still play by yourself for fun (design the teams and let the other players pick sides), but competitive team building is narrow and boring now.

Loved this game when it first came out. One of the games most played with my friends. All of the changes and different things to the game made me quit so I will rate it a 6. Not to mention the outrageous prices on some of the figures. I have not played since they started introducing cards into the game. I am not sure now what set that was. 

Actually I forgot how much fun I had watching my friends get into a fight over some of the rules. It was almost like a comic book in my friends kitchen. I was getting ready to use my invulnerability power just in case I got hit with any foreign objects. The only game where I thought my 2 friends where going to throw down on each other. So in good memories that I can really laugh about now I got to raise this up to a 8.

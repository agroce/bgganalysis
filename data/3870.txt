[First impressions]
The "epic" flavour is of course present, along with a thousand details that make you feel all the sheer volume of the world that this game wants to depict. Nevertheless, for the same reasons, the gameplay can become fiddly and some elements (combat, different unit sets and some leader and artifacts rules among others) made us consider if more straightforward solutions could have been more rewarding, probably taking something away from the "simulation" side, but definitely paying off as far as pure fun and playing time are concerned. Luck is present and, considering the number of ways by which it can influence a game of several hours, someone could rightfully complain about it being even too much present. All in all, I think I can sense the perspective that drove the choices made by the designer and really appreciate some of them, not to mention the epic aim of this game, but probably 7 Ages comes with too much details and some questionable aspects (like overall card balance) for what it really delivers, at least to me and so far: this is only a first impression, after all.

The artwork is good, but not without imperfections: some cards, due to the colourful background, are not well readable and some of the counters share the same problem. The two sides of every counter have sometimes a completely different usage, a detail that can be really annoying. The map is made of card stock (of good quality but still card stock) and a plexiglas panel could come in handy. The rulebook is exhaustive and well written, but some kind of playing aid to sum up rules and exceptions is absolutely needed.

RATING: 8
A grand scale game in every sense of the word. Replay factor seems as good as anything else I own and although the length is prohibiting there are options to cut it short - main concern with doing this would be the ability to catch the initial leader who is determined from a card draw. However, it's all about the experience of playing rather than winning.
The combat system is way too drawn out for this scale of game though.

Epic, sweeping civ game. Although a little unbalanced in the long run (some Civs seem particularly able to score a lot of VPs each turn), this is a Civ game with rich emergent stories, as various cultures rise and fall over the game. Definitely a full day's gaming on a big table.

Played 7 Ages at the club for the first time. I started with the Phoenicians and the Minoans, plus two not very useful third empires, which was a powerful advantage that won far too easily from the beginning against experienced players. Seven players took 4 1/2 hours to enter the Third Age. The combat system is clever but much too long-winded, as a private battle may take 5 mins despite the result being predictable. There was one major engagement during our play time, where the stronger side eliminated the weaker without loss in three rounds. This must be sigificant commentary on the impotence of empires in this game. Combat can and should be executed in a far more efficient manner. I was also wondering if combat gets boring, for example if you win your ancient battle 17 to 6 is it much more exciting to win your Aquarian air battle 80 to 60? The events are more Take That! than Gary Barlow. Players may not have an empire, and this may persist for more than one round. The effects of the Civilise action, such as leaders, governements, artefacts, and state religions are unclear, boring and probably often an irrelevance. It seems the Civilise stuff could be happily excised by those who don't wish to use it at all. And we do need to cut the play time. We thought the game has not been distantly tested either because many elements of gameplay [not the FAQ] gave a strong impression of being better understood at ADG than they are explained by the rules. Although empires are restricted to one action a round, making their development very slow, events may extend [or reduce] this until the fruits of these turbo turns are brought up short by a balancing measure. All this and the 12-year rush to publication begs comparisons with the much simpler Mare Nostrum.. Even if I come to appreciate the Civilise action, the other more basic criticisms seem unlikely to go away and I wonder why such things are still present in new designs in 2004, decades after they first appeared to be undesirable. However the idea of an improved and more interesting version of HotW is excellent, and this game seems to be a good start.

This is an absolutely gorgeous game. The map is huge, the cards are great to look at and the gameplay is well thought out. 
As I hate dice for battle resolutions(battle sequences are the most important game features in my games I play), this game elegantly resolves it by drawing a card from the deck and then the modifiers come into play. This is just great; easy but complex. 
You should not be too attached to your empires you play, because they can  sometimes vanish from the map quite easily, if you getting picked-on. 
I just can recommend this gem!

My impressions after four game sessions: The rules need rewriting desperately. They are badly organized and barely relay the designer%u2019s intentions. Looking up specific rules is difficult. The game can not be played without several cheat sheets. The startup rules need revising because not everyone may be able to begin the game. Nations may be wiped out on the same round on which they begin. The gameboard is ugly and barely functional. Huge ocean areas remain unused while counters are crammed into tiny spaces in Europe. The game can%u2019t be finished. To win is to survive. However, the game is worth playing at least once for anyone who has even a fleeting interest in the subject. I recommend having someone teach this to you.

Outstanding game, one of the favourites in my collection. I really enjoy just the experience of playing this game.I don't mind losing civs to cards played by other players, as you just move on and start a new one. Players who place more emphasis on winning a game for their enjoyment might want to avoid this one as you can end up losing in the end due to bad luck/cards played by your opponents.

RATING: 8
After first game yesterday, my impression of the game is quite favourable. Played with three players, meaning each player has up to five empires. That seems to be a bit much to manage, the game is probably even more fun with more players. Like History of the World on steroids! Best thing about the game: If a catastrophical event occurs (such as my Huns ALL wiped out in  their first battle), you just discard that empire and start a new one. So while battles and events are important, they never put you totally out of the game.

RATING: 6
A large sweeping game that provides for more game play experience than game.  Players can play for some period and drop out and others can join in the middle of a game and somehow it all works out.  Good design balance to handle this, but it also makes it feel like individual actions don't really matter.  Still, the design is innovative enough and noteworthy enough to try the game at least once.  [GTI TGSD]

Awesome historical civilization game that is much more interesting than other games of this genre. It has just enough complexity to be challenging and the length gives it that epic feeling.

RATING: 10
This game is huge. I've yet to finish 1 game going through all the ages. I think we've atmost made 3 during the 7 hours of gameplay we could fit in a single day. If you decide beforehand to play a certain amount of ages to limit the game it really does not matter to not fit all 7 in at once. I'm looking forward to a marathon session sometime in the future but for me this game combines so many great elements in gameplay that it will be forever fun. It doesn't hurt that all my friends are great strategists and really get into games like this. 

Since it takes so long time I guess one of the great lures about this game is that I almost never get to play it. I will always have the desire to play this game again and when I do it is always greatly enjoyable. The combat element is a great deal more tactical then Risk and it's a great challange to keep your tribes and civilizations alive. 

It's a ton of rules and will take alot of time to get into aswell as play. There are however games that are even heavier then this one which I feel is not past the borderline of what is enjoyable or too much to remember or take in.

Great game! This is an initial rating after one 2 player game(2 ages, 8 hrs) and a few solo efforts. I look forward to try this with 4 or five at the table, it will be easier, and probably more fun, to manage three or four empires than seven. The game requires a lot of work just to get it on the table for the first time, cutting, clipping, bagging, labelling, printing out playeraids... Time consuming and absolutely necessary, beware casual gamers! The production flaws lower my rating. This could be a ten after my next playthrough, when the memory of countercutting has faded, and the  five player game reached up to my expectations. (Rating 8)
UPDATE: Have tried it a couple of plays more, three players, and I still enjoy it immensely. I think that you have to love civ-games to love this game, it is certainly not for everyone...but for me it is an "always wanna play".

My favorite mechanic "the cards" are so multpurpose.  This is an excellent civilization game.  The cards used in this game are genius.  There is one deck of cards that are the engine for this game.  The cards are unique in that they habe multiple uses.  In some way they are very much like Magic cards.  They can be used to start a civilization, or act as a permanent with a special attribute or they are an instant that can interrupt moves by others.  The cards are used for scoring, leaders.  The cards with their multiple uses provide difficult choices for players.  This game is very balanced and alot of fun.

Player Aid: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/fileinfo.php?fileid=11365 is a comprehensive summary of everything a player needs to refer to during the game, including clarified Start Empire, Combat, and Trading rules, terrain effects and costs, unit build costs, and sequence of play all in the first 4 pages, plus a further 8 pages listing the effects of all artefact and leader types.

After a fiew plays, numerous analytical discussions, and no fewer than 7 beers, this game has dropped off my "want to play again" list. I have no objection to long games; I have no objection games that rely mostly on luck; I object quite strongly to a game that is both. This game is *very* long and *very* dependent on luck...toss in some downtime between turns and the result is a 2 rating (this game gets a 4 because the systems are fun as hell). I'll play again if there are 6 players, each of whom has played at least as many games as I have, and the entire weekend is devoid of other interesting alternatives...I'll bring a few 2 player games to fill the downtime.

 I really like this game, if you want a game that takes a while and is lots of fun, then I very strongly recommend it.

7 Ages plays differently every play; it is 'chaotic'but also gives a lot of chances for players to come back.  Different empires will be in play in each of the plays, and the ability to stick the leader  can be strong.  
But the victory point 'glory' system really helps; if your empire does well, attains glory, the points it scores are yoru for good.  

It maintains these very nice game features while really giving historical 'flavor' to the empires and events in play.  

So for me, I get history and fun.  However, it is a long game so I wouldn't recommend it to people who want to play a game in one day.

THE big multi civilitation game. Depending on number of players this can be a rather peaceful game of building and whiping out civilisations or a free for all massacre. The fact that you can just quit underperforming civilisations and start new ones keeps players in the game. While it can be hard to catch up, when you are behind it´s still fun to get a great civilisation running and kill of your opponents favourite one.
The rules are not as bad as some people make them sound. There are some errata (not too bad, if you ignore them the game willl still work) and combat is confusing at first read. But well meaning players should be ableto work out rules trouble peacefully.
Main problem is the huge ammount of space and time you will need for this game.While the rules claim, that a turn can be done in 7 minutes, 20-30 minutes will be more realistic for most groups. Depending on the Age it will probably take 5-9 Turns per Age, this means you will end up with 3 hours per age. To really enjoy the game you should at least play 2-3 Ages or somthing like 6-9 hours.
The map is roughly 44"x36" (120x85 cm) and will therefore not fit on most standard tables. There should also be space for up to 15 cards + markers for the empires and a lot (150) counter stacks.
But don´t let this scare you. You can start to play after a couple of minutes and the time will fly.

Played it once, enjoyed it, and would like to play it again soon.  The amount of time necessary for a meaningful game prevents it from being rated any higher for me.

Rating downgraded from 7.5 to 6 after 6-8 2-hour sessions of a game that only got us about 3/4 finished.  Lots of fiddly rules and exceptions resulted in regular consultations of the rules and multiple FAQs, slowing down the game and adding to the already copious down time.  If a group of people knew the game well enough to make decisions quickly, it could be fun, but the time investment to get to that point would be huge (and I don't see myself making it).

Very very bad rules.

The idea is fantastic. The execution doesn't quite manage
what is promised. Between the rules and the components'
lacking any devices to help remind you of what some of them
actually do (mainly artifacts here - but leaders too: they
should give what phase they affect at least; ah hell, the
cards are too cluttered to quickly grasp as well, and at
least one is nearly unreadable), this game is a real chore.
On top of that, some illogical seeming (under any interpretation
of the rules) results seem to occur (in terms of spread
of technology especially - this should be more detailed).

Overall, it looks like the base idea for what could be a
much richer game on the same subject as History of the World,
but one that has nearly as many flaws, without being 
anywhere near as accessible. Pity.

Great game. A real monster...took us 40 hours to play. The game can be a little repetitive at times and has a lot of downtime. The rules are full of exceptions and detail and it has a massive learning curve.

Each culture has it's own way of scoring points though, and in order to do well in the game you must play to that culture... of course, being able to select you culture means you have a range of play styles/objectives to choose from when selecting.

So I was going through, revising some ratings, and I saw that I gave this game a '6'. What on earth was I thinking? This is horrifically awful game by any reasonable critical standards. The game is ludicrously random and the cards are rediculously unbalanced. The rules and play aids (or lack there of) are cripplingly awful, and you will have to provide. The trade & progress action is laughably broken. Some interesting ideas are executed with breathtaking incompetance. The folks who rate this game a 10 are delusional. Obscene game length plus virtually unlimited "take-that" hoseage plus broken event cards is not exactly a recipie for success.

My feeling is that this game really wants to be less fiddly and - yes - less complicated. Constantly referencing charts and tables to ascertain what a particular leader or artifact does does not appeal to me. Not even World in Flames features that sort of fiddliness (unless you're playing with Leaders in Flames (not a good idea anyway IMO)). 7 Ages could have well done without the fiddliness of Leaders in Flames. I believe the game could have done well without the generic leaders and a streamlining of the historical ones. Napoleon and Caesar having the same features, Leonardo and Picasso as well, etcetc. Basic types instead of all this variation.

Combat could have also been made shorter. Perhaps the artifact use of a card could have also been done away with. Instead, trade might have given you - next to the civilization advance - a choice of a tech along a tech tree. More strategic choice and less dependence on card draws.

Counters... Man, I don't see why the counter sets should be differentiated. One chariot less here, one trireme more there. Umph. More general differentiation of counter sets - more navy, less cav etc would have been preferable. Having to reference such a detailed play aid in order to make out those marginal differences isn't exactly my kind of fun. Too fiddly.

Bottom line: More attention should have gone into removing the more fiddly bits in order to shorten play time. Also, card draw luck could have been reduced say by removing the artifacts from the cards and making them generally available on a tech tree. As it is, it has too much gratuitous complexity typical for games from the 1980s.

Oh man, I was really looking forward to this game ... It's long, but I don't mind that; the feel is very Chariot Lords/History of The World.  But say hello to the MOST ANNOYING COMBAT SYSTEM EVER!  I have never seen a more weasely combat system in my life.

Also, encourages EXTREME kill-the-leader play--don't think that if you've got the lead most of the game that you have ANY chance of winning:  you will be bashed into oblivion at the end, and someone else will play some weasely event or two to come from outta nowhere to win ... so ... there's that.

When I started to play this one I found it fun, but long and luck oriented.
Now after 7 game sessions, after lowering the rating time after time I guess I got it right. This is just the 1st edition, I think Rowland will get it right on the 3rd or 4th after he will get the feedback from all the buyers - playtesters. 
The game has a definite appeal and that is found in human history not centainly in the game itself.
I once wrote bad press for Empires of the Middle Ages, at least that was a good simulation, 7 Ages is a bad and long game and an awful simultion.
Its veeeeery long playing time, with a lot of dead time between players turn, rulebook is confusing, there is a lot of over-discussed stuff especially in the civ-phase, the cards are ridicoulosy overpowered and bad draws can screw one's game.
In spite of all this the game a friend of mine still found it fun to play.
BEWARE: the more I play this game the less I like it, it cames out as one of those game that you can get out of the shelves once in a three years and have some fun. You can also say to have played the beast. The amount of time is far too much for the enyojment it delivers.
I'm not going to actually search out games of this.

I have known Harry Rowland for many years and I believe he is a great designer. I also think that his rules are extremely hard to work out and work through.

I owned this game for four years before I played it. I couldn't understand the rules.

I was taught the game by friends who also couldn't understand the rules. They actually had to get Harry to come and spend the weekend with them so he could teach them the rules.

The game is actually fairly simple mechanically.

Great game, but way too long if you want to play all 7 ages. One 3-player game I played took 46 hours!

Se trata de un juego de civilizaciones dirigido por cartas un poco especial. No juegas con una civilización, sino con varias. Las civilizaciones van apareciendo en la partida y desapareciendo a medida que los jugadores las van jugando.
Las cartas tienen un valor (cuanto más alto mejor suele ser la carta), una civilización, un evento y un artefacto. Artefactos son de todo un poco: maravillas, religiones, formas de gobierno, guerras, etc. Los eventos suelen ser muy potentes si se juegan en el momento adecuado. Las civilizaciones las hay mejores y peores, aunque todas pueden ser muy buenas dependiendo de la situación de la partida.
Cada turno de juego consiste en ejecutar una acción con cada imperio (civilización) que controlas. Las opciones son: mover y combatir, comerciar, civilizar, producir, etc. Hay que pensar bien qué quieres hacer con cada uno, ya que si produces no te mueves, si te mueves no comercias, si comercias no civilizas (construir maravillas, adoptar religiones, conseguir líderes, construir ciudades, etc), etc.

Se van ganando puntos de victoria en la medida que tus civilizaciones de cada turno sean capaces de cumplir con sus objetivos (que vienen descritos mediante iconos en la propia carta). Estos objetivos suelen ser bastante históricos (Los Egipcios ganan PVs si son los que más maravillas construyen, los Hunos los ganan si se extienden por el mundo sacudiendo a todo el que se cruza en su camino, los ingleses si dominan los mares, etc).

El juego se hace algo lento al principio (en las dos primeras edades de un total de siete). Después mejora esta sensación (normalmente en la segunda sesión de juego).

Me da la sensación que el juego podría mejorar con algunos cambios en las reglas que permitieran más maniobrabilidad, y tiene algunas cartas con eventos claramente descompensados. Por lo demás me parece un juego divertidísimo, lo mejor es la sensación de ver como estas construyendo una historia paralela del mundo. Lo peor los primeros turnos que pueden provocar de hecho que la partida no continue hasta los turnos en los que el juego brilla de verdad.

En definitiva: me encanta este juego!!

RATING: 7
What a great game!  You get to control multiple empires across the years.  This game is not as complex as it may appear at first glance.  The rules are only 12 pages long after all.  Our first two playings didn't take as long as I thought they would (we only played through one age each time).  The game's designer responds very quickly to any questions posted here.  I was so moved by this game after playing it that I went out and bought an extra for archival purposes, and I have never felt the need to own two copies of any game.  I will say that relatively speaking it is pricey for the quality of the components, but I still feel that it is worth it for the gameplay alone.

RATING: 8
This is a really fun, tense and immersive game. Yes, it takes ages to play. Especially since playing less than 3 ages worth is just an open luckfest. But when you hit that fourth age with a wide spread of empires crowded onto the board... every hour of play is amongst the best hours of gaming I've enjoyed. Our recent game of Total History (all Ages 1-7!) is an experience I'll never forget (or often repeat). The fiddly factor is significantly decreased with the abundance of play-aids and using blocks for disorder, forts, etc.

RATING: 6
Interesting. Experience game. Too much randomness to worry too much about winning and losing. Too much bashing the leader. Too much game length. Just plain too much.

But playing an age or two is a fine way for a group to spend the day.

You want exactly 5 players here to deal with the fact that there are 15 race tokens to be divided amongst the players. Or at least you don't want 4 or 6.

RATING: 2
One of my biggest disappointments ever. I thought and hoped that this would be the CIV game we had all been looking for (Capital letters and all). Unfortunately it wasn't so. And to make things worse it wasn't even an ok game but a travesty of a game. Avoid. 

The idea behind the game is cool but to be honest it doesn't work at all. There are just too many things that could have been streamlined or made better. Why have differences between the colours for example; does it really add that much to the game? To me it was just added confusion. The combat system is very odd as well, I'd prefer some sort of dice rolling instead. Would cut several hours of playing time as well.

I also think this game is too luck based. There's very little strategy involved as I see it, just have to draw the right empires and events and you'll win 9 out of 10 games.

Actually this game deserves a "1" rating but I raised it a bit due to good intentions at least.

RATING: 5
An intriguing game where players can found, nuture, and ulimately discard any of 110 different civilizations throughout the game.  Players are dealt a hand of cards and can take a certain number of different actions each turn.  Actions include found empire, discard empire, produce, civilize, move and so on.  Each empire can only take one of these available actions, so you have to get into a certain tempo in how you juggle your actions.  It's all about grabbing glory by reaching certain goals specific to each empire (think Britannia), and glory is how you win.  This really doesn't do the game justice - there is so much here crammed into the (relatively short) rules, counters and cards, and it's stuffed full of civilization building flavour.  It seems very open ended, you can join a game at any time by dealing yourself in, and declare the game over at any time also.  I'm keen to play more right now.  A note of caution - this game has a large footprint.

- My first outing was a 4 player game, and we started in the 4th age.  After 4½ hrs. of play, we were about 3/4 way through the age.  I really like the game, and the concepts it presents.  I walked away feeling like we just barely scratched the surface.
- My 2nd play was a 5 player game, I joined the game in progress and started late in the 1st age.  After 6 hrs., I had progressed to late 3rd age.  Even though this game allows for late arrivals, I think it is best to start when everyone else does.  I certainly felt at a disadvantage where the scoring was concerned.
- Confirmed: Starting late puts you at a disadvantage.  I was waiting to join in on the 'next' round.  As the round was coming to a close, someone played a card which doubled Glory scoring.  Needless to say, 4 hours later, I was sitting at 33 points, and the point leader was at 80...you have to start the game when everyone else does!

RATING: 7
I found this game quite interesting although my other 5 colleagues didn't quite fancy it. My only gripe, other than the game size, is the fact that your carefully built civilisation can be razed or irrepairably damaged by a single action card. Got to bite the bullet and play through all the ages to see if this is a significant problem. Otherwise, this lengthy game appeals to me.

RATING: 6
Played this game a several times. It didn't bought, but I could play it from time to time. You need to plan on several meeting to complete a full game.

Advantage of the game is that empires can rise and fall at any moment. So in one turn you could harvest 10 victory points, and in next 0. Thus, it is hard for players to get far away from other players. Especially since, when you are leading, most players play against you.

Disadvantage of the game is that it is a bit more complicated than it is needed. It takes really a lot of time to play. And you need to know "combo" cards with which you could destroy any civilization in a turn.

I predict this will attain classic status. The design is very elegant, the only problem lying in the fact that the playing time is somewhere in-between "History of the World" and "Advanced Civilization" (but the downtime is MUCH less than in these 2 games). This is the best attempt so far that tries to emulate world history on a grand scale. Harry Rowland can be applauded, the long wait was worth it!

There is a lot of downtime to the game; but it is well designed.  Not certain with the set of rules there is a solution to the downtime as is.  Pressing for alacrity is required.  The game is long.  With myself being the least-played player (and trying to move fairly quickly by pre-planning, etc.) We had an age 2 - age 3 game take 2.5 hours with four players.  I am not certain how the game would behave with more/less.

7 ages sets the standard for bloated, epic, empire-building games.  It is very ambitious and succeeds in what it sets out to do.  The rules are akin to a wargame rather than a eurogame, however, in play it is a hybrid. There are many interesting strategic and tactical choices, Lots of player interaction and high replayibability.  However, for a game of this lenght and complexity, the "take that" factor seems way too high.  

The playing time is insane.

The purchase price of the game is probably worth it simply for the map - it is gorgeously amazing!  The map alone makes me want to design a game that is actually playable on it.

The game could have been made less detailed and more accessible, but it is pretty clear that that was not the goal.  Not something I will every play again.

far too much luck for a game that takes 8-16 hours to play.  the game really needs a play aid for terrain, events, etc. to avoid constantly flipping through the rules.  Combat is over-wrought, and having the winner take no losses really removes tension from the game.  In the three ages played, events and what empire you drew mattered far more than any decisions made my the players.  Would try once more if the gaming group really wanted to play, but I think History of the World is about the same arc of history for far less time, and Empires of the Middle Ages is more interesting for an epic (i.e. long) empire building game.

RATING: 9
Has elements of both a Euro and an AH classic i.e. innovative and yet fiddly. 

At it's heart it is a card game, military campaigns are of limited value while an empire can be destroyed with the right combination of cards. So use the empires while they perform and dump them when they don't.

Its a very looong game, but with a nice tempo, takes about 30 hours to play all seven ages, so somewhere to leave it between sessions is a must.

Having been introduced via one of the shorter scenarios I'd really love to set aside a full day and play all 7 ages.

VERY rare misfire by the outstanding team at ADG. Epic misfire. 

I had massive hopes for this game, after EiA and WiF/DoD masterpieces. Cards just didn't work for a card driven wargamer like me, with players saving up for perfect killer combo's. Scale/time didn't work at all for me; felt like operational scale battles nestled in a strategic level game (I hate battle boards in strategic/operational games). LOTS of downtime for players. And, way too many other issues. 

Applaud the idea of the game, but a loud "booooooo" to the execution. 

Having said that, I'll buy the next ADG design sight unseen.

Some of the mechanics are a little bit like Vinci or Barbarian Kingdom & Empire. Lots of interaction between the various empires and a nice twist with the different colours having slightly different combat strengths, numbers and unit mixes. Combat and trade involves a good deal of bluff and luck.

Unfortunately due to the Combat and Trade systems this is hard to play solo. It looks like it will have a bad bash the leader problem as you can harm your neighbours a great deal either with cards or your secondary powers. Also having many neighbours appears to be a big disadvantage. A lot of Glory is from having the most of X,Y or Z and thats much easier when you have room to expand.

But it got some great ideas and the right feel. 

Update after 3 Player game: Combat is good despite my initial reservations. Grouping up your Civs can be an advantage. We all thought the random events were too strong vs other players and will probably house rule this. Some cards very strong. One allows the PLAYER to get half the difference in Glory Points to the next highest. This could be a huge number. Due to luck of the cards and playing time this game is more of process / activity than a competitive game (though there is a lot of skill in it). Loved it though and upped rating to a 9.

A game that is seriously hard work. Around a simple and elegant core lies all the fussy rules and mechanisms of a hex-and-counter wargame (or in this case province-and-counter). The rules are poorly written and it's a shame that a couple of sorting trays couldn't have been included in a game in which counter management is essential. There's a good game in there somewhere, but personally I'm not going to spend the time and effort needed to find it.

Outstanding.  Horribly Long.  

When at a con, this game is always VERY HIGH on my list to try to put together.  An all day 7 Ages marathon is just too much to pass.  Sadly, its nigh impossible to get this one going any other way

--------------

2011 Bgg.con.  I'm convinced this game's military combat is its only downside.  I think I'll suggest eliminating it and going "all-in" for all future games...that's what ancient military did, anyway.

The luck factor is extremely high, in occasions even absurd. There is a lot of randomness, as drafting the better empire will make you score a lot more points than your opponents, while an event card can literally raze an empire.
The game is ludicrously random and the cards are rediculously unbalanced. 
Other problem is that the game can be incredibly long (minimum 15 hours), much more than Civilization, with which has been wrongly comparated. 
The combat procedure is weird and not much useful. IMO a quicker one would have been better. Results are often dramatic and extreme, as loser is wiped out while the winner lose nothing. More rounds are very useful just with big stacks.
The game can be quite fun but it will be difficult for me to complete a even single match and on the long run is repetitive 
Genial and very ambitious idea but the poorly explained and insufficiently detailed rules. It is one of the few games that has the faq but extensive and bigger that the rules.

I played this game through one age so far as a sort of practice game. It was just two players so we could get a feel for what it was all about. Since I haven't played a "full" game, I can't give it a rating. Given how long it takes to play, I'm not sure I'll ever get a chance.

I'd like to play again with multiple players sometime, but I'm not particularly interested in sitting through another hour of rules explanation.  Unfortunately finding an experienced group to play 7 Ages is...difficult.  There are too many great and simpler Civ games out there, unfortunately.  I doubt I'll ever finish a game that started at Age 1.  My latest attempt took 16 hours and made it to the start of Age 6 before we got sick of it.

I'm finding I just don't have a great desire to play this again.  There's more rules chrome than Civ but I've never been a part of a group that actually knew all the rules.  It's sad, there's so much potential in 7 Ages.  I'd consider buying the long-rumored computer version.

I highly recommend the 3-player game - minimizes downtime and removes the "factor of 15" imbalance that arises from trying to divide 15 token sets among a number of players that is not a factor of 15.  It's also not as easy to get stuck in a production-maneuver-civilize rut with five different actions on one's turn.

It was a 9 for me until my 4th play.  On my 4th play we started in age 1, and a card eliminated my only civ.  Then I sat out for 2+ hours because I didn't draw a card for 3 or 4 turns with a civ. that could start in age 1.  (I got two cards that could start in age 1 if another specific civ was in play, but those civ's were not, so the cards couldn't play.)

After the game I proposed a rule change: If someone did not have a civ. and did not have a card that could start a new civ, then they discard and redraw their hand until they found a startable civ.

But I couldn't convince my buddies to allow this rule change, so I'm lowering my rating.

Somewhat fiddly but very fun game of humanity thru the ages. See 110-civilizations come and go as the game runs from approx 4000bc to the present day. Harvest Glory (VPs) but be prepared to kill off your civs when they become non-productive, then move on to newer, more advanced civilizations. 

Although the game plays with 2-15 people, it is best with five. Six or more tends to slow it down, but if the game begins on or after Age-2, it speeds up. For those interested in playing this one, player aids are a must. I have several that I have found on the 'net and will be posting them shortly. Expect an expansion to 7 Ages within a year or so. Highly recommended.

All of the great designs in a good game are in this one.  Lots of player interaction and decisions, and combat is not the way to win.  There are no dice rolls to contend with (although the single card drawn for combat is a bit chancey), but you get to see it before committing units.  Now we can play the 2 best games ever - 7 Ages up to WWII and then decide the winner with World in Flames.

Compared to other Civilization games very historical, as the "real" civilizations appear in the right time in the right places. The game simulates really well how the nations rise, prosper, then decline and finally disappear into the dust of history, just to be replaced by other ones. 

While the main outline of the gameplay is clear an simple, the game seems a little bit too overburden with single rules for leaders, events, artefacts, etc.

Huge scope to this game. Human history from beginning to end basically. It's up to the first player which of the 7 ages you start in and up to the group which age you play to. Playing all 7 ages would take absolutely forever. Despite the plodding nature of the game it is quite a good time with each civilization having their own way to score points. Some are very handy at scoring but usually only in certain ages. Others seem to be stopgaps to net you a few points while you search for a more worthy civilization to lead. Getting hosed by the cards is possible but there are opportunities to catch up later.

As I think when I see this game for the first time,  I played it for a very looong time. The trouble is that this looong time was for the same match. During this time nothing really appens: when I draw bad cards I fall down in VP, when I draw good cards I rise up in VP. In that time I can play Enemy at the Gates and my decisions can have some impact on victory... This game sucks.

The game is completely ruled by randomness. 
Besides, the cards are wildly unbalanced and the lenght of a full game (seven ages) can be immense.

RATING: 9
Astonishing. This is THE game of civilization, evolution, history. It's the game I was waiting for, my kind of game.
As for the components: the map is huge and goodlooking, it's cardboard -it's true- but it's glossy cardboard and NOT the Ambush-like paper maps. So it seems reliable and durable. The counters are difficult to punch, so beware: you may have to cut them with a cutter sometimes. But they are big, goodlooking and on glossy cardboard, so this compensate the cutting work. The rulebook is clear, there are some errata to get here on BGG, but for a game so huge in scope this is natural. The cards are extremely good in material and even if there are lots on info on them they are quite usable and with good graphics. The overall quality and appearence is excellent.
As for the gameplay it will be long, but this is the goal of this game to represent the whole human history and it succeeds. You will not play this game every night like Settlers, but when you'll play you'll be satisfied.
In few words: if you're looking for a Civ/Empire building game 7 Ages is the one to get, there are no alternatives to this between Euro games, and it beats other US-kind of games like History of the World. As for me, I'll probably get another copy the next month... you never know but for me this in the future will become a classic so better have one more copy.
UPDATE: rating go down to 9 'cause of the production values. It's a pain in the a$$ to have to cut all the counters with a cutter, and the print in some of them is not centered and some text is slightly cut.

RATING: 7
pros: The game really gives you a feeling of rising and falling empires - the huns and mongols are nicely done - really being a pain to mankind, tossing quite a few empires back in development. It's good fun to play with a couple of beers and the right "not overly competitive" playerscons: It really takes AGES when the games starts in an early ages - nobody is REALLY interested in trade and progress and everybody gets stuck consequently in dark ages - so far we have play about 20 hours and advanced only one age! Side note: If you are in for _competitive play_, 7 ages is certainly not the game of choice - it is way to luck dependent and as soon as a player advances too far the rest of all players teams up on and shatter him. With all the wild events that's easy enough. Basically that means an early wild lead, that would certainly bring you victory in other games means almost nothing in 7 ages. But if you want to sit down with your friends, have a couple of beers and have a great laugh or wonder how nicely Harry Rowland incooperated special features to make every people behave the way they really behaved in history - go and get this game - it really is a gem in making you feel history - but gamewise it is broken in many places..!

Essen '04- did not expect it there.  Decent price.  Cards are gorgeous.  After a three-hour session with 4, and another with 3 players, I am  giving it a high mark, expecting it to hold.  Nice mix in the game, nice evolution of culture... good compliment to the game Civilization.  Takes a while to explain, but nice order of play gets everyone involved.  Glad I decided to go for it.  Anxiously awaiting the creaking treadmill of ADG to bring out the expansion.

RATING: 5.5
Pros: I like the combat system, for the most part. Great theme and you do feel as though you are guiding civilizations through the ages. Epic in scale -- no other game that I know can compare to the experience of playing 7 ages. Multi-use cards can generate good amount of angst indeciding how/when to best play it. Same for action tokens (only one of each action allowed).
Cons: High randomness factor. Battles in the initial ages can go either way, regardless of tactics. Getting a civilization of the right age to start off with can also be problematic; I've seen a player wait 6 turns (4 hours)before being able to start playing the game. While there is some ansgt in deciding how to play cards, it is always better to have high-rated cards than have low-rated ones; yet another random factor comes into play. Same goes for civilizations; a player that manages to draw Egypt, Rome and Japan has a much better shot at winning the game than the one who draws the amazons, inuits and aztecs. Considering the theme, that wouldn't bother me for a game that takes, say, 3 hours, but this one can easily take 20-25 hours to play...

RATING: 6.9
Played 10 times now. Lowered the rating from 9, because the game can be FRUSTRATING when playing with slower players. Lots of math, sometimes too powerfull cards, game can be decided by luck. But anyways it is an excellent history simulation. You need to be a warmachine playing with Mongols, naval power with the Engligh, progress oriented with other empires... Very fun. The way some artifacts work, like Jihad or United Nations are very interesting. The problems of the game are the LONG playtime, lack of player aids and some details on rules not covered on the rulebook. Good replay value (if you can convince players to join you).

Should have liked this one because I really like AdvCiv, History of the World, Age of Renaissance ... I was not able to get into.  Seems to me that there is too many little things that does not add much to game but complexity (combat for example)

I find the production, well... Ugly map, busy cards difficult to read, counter mix is messy for markers, forts & leaders.

Make no mistake, if you want to play the whole thing this is a LONG game. However, playing one age takes approximately 2 hours. I suspect that playing one or two ages at a time will be the majority of game sessions (2-4 hours). Excellent replayability. The number of empires, card effects, leaders, and permuatations is staggering. Not overly difficult but the myriad of interactions make the strategy quite complex. A Masterpiece!

Some neat ideas for a Civ game. One that could really shine in today's gaming climate if it wasn't so damn long. The combat, in particular, could use some streamlining, though I really like how different leaders/civs can crop up. A second edition of this would be really neat to see. As it is, I prefer Nations and Historia for my civ board games. Even Through the Ages clocks in at a shorter time frame than this does.

A truly epic game that is looong but the player is rewarded with a fun and varying experience where civilizations rise and fall through the ages. I particularly like the action mechanism, where you have to choose different actions for your different empires (and never have enough). Perhaps a bit too chaotic to play strategically but still a game that every civilization game fan should have played.

Great game, but should have more rules or at least suggestions for shorter and more competitive play (automatic victory).
Best way for one session is to play 2 ages. That allows cancelling the luck due to the strength or weakness of the start empires and can be played in one day.

OK. This is it!!  The ultimate game in my book.  Have played 11 times already  and just absolutely had fun (a bit on the wild side), but extreme fun.  The exhilaration of drawing a new destiny card hand is like the moment when you meet your soul-mate, starting a new job or moving to a new town.  Wow!!  Will have to get another copy so I always can play this one.  What a game.  I will wear out my first copy for sure.  (I actually now own four copies of this game, one of which is still in shrink for posterity.)  If I was stranded on a deserted island and only could have one game with me, this would unquestionably be the one I would choose due to the amazing variability and sweeping historical grandeur.

I even played one game on Vassal with 4 other players from Ireland, Switzerland, Norway and Germany and we played by e-mail for over one full year.  I played the Romans in November and had Jesus come into play on Christmas Day, somehow amazingly.

Being an ancient Japanese/Chinese History/Asian Studies major in college, this game paints on a very broad and sweeping canvas as the players re-crease the rise and fall of over 110 different civilizations from ancient times to the modern day over the course of 7 Ages.  The players have control in which age they start the game through the first card play or they can simply start from Age 1 for the full experience.  Pretty amazing flexible experience from this unusual and never before seen variable start mechanism.

The way the cards interact and the tough choices you have to make with multiple purpose cards really make the game challenging and replay value is nearly endless.  Incredible how map comes out about like real history but with slightly different twists...7 Ages is a race for “glory” by cycling multiple empires. I had the Early Finns controlling most of Europe before someone Forest Fire/Rebelled them!! You can't ride an empire too long...need to be nimble and find quiet spots on the map to do your own thing if you can..but someone will come along and whack you...lead changes many times, we've found.  Good balance to the game due to harsh events....always need to carry protection!!  110 unique empires to manage and nearly that many unique leaders--including Jesus, Buddha, Confucius, Picasso...not to mention the obvious Alexander/Napoleon/Elizabeth...I repeat, this game has Jesus in it!!  He let's you draw cards from the discard pile for your destiny action!

Playtime variable from 7 minutes (opening card play & set-up only) to 24 hours but realistically you need 3-6 hours to really enjoy the true depth and flavor of this amazing game.  All 11 games I have played have been over 8 hours for very good reason and every player in the game was sad when we had to stop.

Here is to 7 Ages as Game of the Century!!

It deserves it!! Thank you, Harry Rowland.

Revised downwards from provisional 4. Second evening devoted to this dog convinced me it has serious problems. Game time scales make a nonsense of movement and especially battle mechanisms. The limited action per Empire per turn encourage planning but the random "take that" events and the very high luck factor in the cards you draw make it virtually impossible to implement many carefully laid plans. The game effectively plays itself with the players are rather uninvolved observers.

A slow, clunky and inelegantly old fashioned design loaded with useless chrome - gave me a splitting headache after each evening of play. For an epic also strangely uninvolving - the game is not sure what viewpoint it is trying to place the players in but as their influence on proceedings is marginal compared to the general randomness ultimately this hardly matters.

Extraordinary what some geeks seem to like, but this is a real dog.
In almost every way Civilisation seems a better bet - and not sure even that has aged well.

Excellent game. Goes all the way through human history, but without following it in detail. Empires come and go, which makes it stand out from the usual approach of 'build-up-your-(single)-empire-during-the-entire-game'.

RATING: 1
A twelve hour war game disguised as a civilization game, dominated by the luck of the draw.  With its exciting premise and admirable attention to detail, 7 Ages is, hands down, the most bitterly disappointing game I've ever played.  And, I played a full game, not a partial one like some of the other haters here (not that I blame them).

Note:  I've taken some heat for calling this a war game, but I stand by the statement.  At the end of the day, 7 Ages is all about squabbling over territory.  You earn VPs by occupying areas, and you occupy areas by fighting anyone who happens to already be there.  That, in and of itself, is not necessarily a bad thing, but remember, this is a game where a single card can negate three hours of work.  The impact of luck in 7 Ages simply cannot be overstated, and for a game that takes so long to complete, that's inexcusable.

Yes, it takes long, very long to play this game through. But there are so many elegant mechanics built into it and there really is not much downtime with experienced players. Watching Empires rise and fall, sometimes like in actual human history, sometimes the other way around (etruscans beating romans) is great fun.

Got a quick demo of this at Essen 2004. I'm a big fan of big Civ-type games like this, and I dont know if it was the demo that was bad, but the game just didnt work.  We had some players who couldnt even start playing at the start of the game.  Combat was on dice and was "I win: you lose *all* your armies, I lose none"
Was looking forward to this game and horribly disappointed.
Prepared to be convinced otherwise if anyone buys it, forces me to play it and tell me that we were playing it all wrong.

I so wanted to love this game. It has lots to attract - the multi-purpose cards, the differing empires, the balance betwen build and expand forced on you by action limitations. But then there's chrome too far - the unnecessary unit variety, the elongated war resolution, the leaders, the artefacts - all of which just add minutae and length for little to no added enjoyment and consigns the game to the shelves.

RATING: 5
For what is essentially a card game (albeit with a board and chits), this is an incredibly long and intense game. There are few games where when I got done playing, I needed to take a long break but this was one of them. An intense brain-burner that takes hours and hours to play to conclusion. Is all this time and effort worth it? I would say probably not but others might disagree. Some folks are into that kind of thing and once in a while I can be talked into such a game but not often enough to consider owning a copy.

BTW, I disagree with the complaints concerning luck. Too long? Definitely. Too procedural? I agree. Too fiddly? Yup. Too much luck? I'm not seeing it. Especially since you can take an action and replace any cards you want during a turn. The only real "luck factor" is at the very beginning of the game when the player who chooses an era goes first. If everyone else has a civ in that era to start and you don't, you are screwed. Other than that, I'm not seeing the overwhelming "luck factor" in this game.

Big and ambitious, but overly so - convoluted, confusing rules makes this game difficult to approach. The board is so big, and the cards so difficult to read that it is almost impossible to tell what your opponents have in front of themselves. It feels like a solitaire exercise with other people getting in your way. I really wanted to like this one - maybe I'll try the second edition if they make one for me.

7 Ages is a long (LONG!) civilization game, where you take control of multiple civilizations, and can put them in decline in order to take up new civilizations as the game progresses.  Each civilization you control is like a mini point engine--you get a number of points for it each turn, often depending on how that civilization compares to others.  It has the usual civilization game trappings, with technologies, leaders, combat, etc.  I have yet to play a full game of this (which I've heard takes more than a day), but I'd like to at some point.

One of the most positive multi-player aspects is that there is very little down time for the players.  Not a huge fan of the combat resolution.  All the leader counters and varied types of religion and governments makes the game rather fiddly.  The extras, provided on BGG by the players of the game, have made the game much easier to play.

I've played a few mock rounds with some friends - I haven't really delved into the deep mechanics of the game.  Gamesinabox.com delivered a good product and was about 20 bucks less than listed price. So far, the game is awesome. For the list price, I'd expect better 'bits', the cards are beautiful, too.  Nice, big map. Update:  Still haven't played much.. The game seems a bit too much for my for my immediate circle of friends, but I'm sure I'd enjoy it with experienced gamers.  My rating reflects my desire to give this game a fair shot, given the time required to play all 7 ages.

Update:  I really don't know when I'll get the chance to play this.  It really will take a long time, and I think I'll have to trade it away.  For shame.

When do I play this?:
Although I haven't played it completely yet, this game is only played when I can find gamers who would be interested in a 16-hour civ-fest.. which so far is never.

UPDATE:
This game has now been traded - It's on the way out the door.  Goodbye, 7 Ages.  I wish I played more of ya.

UPDATE:
Definitely not for me... maybe in a different life, different time, different situation... but right now - it's fun to just talk about.

I played this (unplayable) monster two times (the second time only, because I thought I must have missed something in the first play). Although I like long games, especially with a good topic like this one, this game is in big need of a good developer. Great basic ideas, but too much unnessessary detail, ugly components, and I became bored after the first two hours.

RATING: 9
Excellent game.  Kind of reminiscent of History of the World and Civilization computer game.  You can do a lot more with your Empire through the Ages than with History of the World.  It is a little wild, but this helps maintain game balance and means that people behind can often have a chance to catch up.  You really get attached to some of your Empires, others you toss away after a few turns.  Can be a long game, but you can resonably play it for a set period of time (such as one Age).

There are a number of interesting mechanisms in this game - the map connects as a globe (left to right, top corners to each other), the cards facilitate many options, the progress chart and military mix relationship. However, the downtime is brutal and the number of rules and components that play a minor part in the outcome is enormous. This has all the feel of a heavily chromed two player wargame but can put many more than two in play which only contributes to the downtime. Running multiple civilizations contributes to the sustained interest but also to the downtime as there are really up to 15 seperate decisions going on and each player has to refocus on the civ at hand as that civ's action comes up. Mind you we printed out all the charts for everyone (bound and sorted) and played for two days. We had fun but wouldn't do it again without modified rules to keep the pace and interest up.

This game needs a variant set of rules that greatly simplifies the various components and mechanisms so the rules don't need to be referred to or adjudicated so often.

Potentially very interesting, but falls totally flat in execution. Interesting use of the "rise and fall" mechanic, but completely undone by the scoring and poorly balanced cards. For example, one game witnessed a player leaping from last to first place by bring the Polynesians into play. No one had an empire in the region to oppose him nor any meaningful way of countering his scoring categories for a good length of time. While empires in Europe slugged it out for a few points here or there, Polynesia continued to reap an enormous harvest without any considerable effort. 

Ultimately, there is the kernel of an interesting game here, smothered by a heap of development problems. A strong candidate for a heavily revised second edition.

After about 10 hours of game play under my belt, I feel like I can finally give this one a score. Overall, this is an outstanding epic game. I think they really hit their mark with this one.

Back when all I really had to do was eat, breath, and play war games. Oh, how the times have changed.

RATING: 4
Played twice, but this is really the sort of game that only gets played multiple times by those who love it.  It works, barely, but would be much improved by some stream-lining to focus on the interesting stuff of spreading civilizations, government systems and religions.  Terrain effects for movement are crazy in a game with 50-100 year long turns, and they don't make sense for combat either.  The fiddliness is just too high for a game where everyone needs to make an effort to keep it rolling: it is easy to miss a leader (yours or someone else's) or a card-effect that you needed to play at a particular time. The way each empire may act at a different time actually increases downtime as there is no consistent rhythm to how the turn order moves which leads to pauses...  However the game does manage to give different empires objectives that can generate some interestingly different empire types to play.  The card-whack factor is far too high a level of randomness in a game that runs as long and requires as much thought as this. The game is a soup pot of stuff with the kitchen sink thrown in - the flavour is OK, but it is too stodgy to digest.  Playing this game convinced me to go out and buy Vinci: if Seven Ages were distilled to an easily playable game it would be Vinci, all the extras add flavour but at too great a cost.

Has a nice looking map - but the paper could be heavier.

Nice cards, good stock, but some of the text is hard to read when it is over a very colorful background.

Lots of chits - good looking, and are manageable in the game.

The game system works well for area control bit aside from that the myriad of special powers rules for artifacts and empires are a bit overwhelming and are easily not remembered.

Aside from planning and attempting to control areas, the other choices to make during a turn are not that interesting. In comparison, Pax Britanica has area control and lends itself well to diplomacy, plus it the ability to control an area is not just through conquest - and the game is a lot quicker to play.

All in all I like sweep of history games and every game of 7 Ages is an interesting exploration of alternate history, but it has too many special rules that tend to frustrate.

7 ages is a brilliant game. I really admire a well designed game. In the past few years only two other games have impressed me as much. (Puerto Rico and Europe Engulfed). It is true that it is a long game (if you play 7 ages) and it has tons of detail (this is an understatement). So some will say that it lacks elegance but this is not so. The basic game system is reasonably clean.The details are in the cards, artefacts, and leaders. 

But the best is how the limited number of counters in each age interacts with money available and the geography to make the empires come out roughly right. In one game (the Romans did not appear) the Etruscans grew to be roughly what the Romans were historically. (Wonderfull). You get get a real feeling that this game is showing you a reasonable history without completely preprogramming it. It is extremely hard to design a reasonable simulation that is also a great game. 7 ages succeeds in this. 

7 ages is fun. The first time out is slow but after that it speeds up. After each turn, I want to see how the next turn will end up. I don't really care if I am winning or not, it is just fun to take a new empire from its birth and see how it will grow up.

The only flaw is that there are perhaps a little too many bells and whistles. A leaner game would still have been fun.

Great game !

Only played this once. A friend of mine who played it with me said, "There are some games you play, and they are really great. Then there are some games you play, and then they end.

Quite fiddly, but reasonably fun. It soaks up a lot of time and although I'd like to try it out again and again I see myself choosing other games over this one due to the time required to find out how everything is done. If I could just get over this learning curve my desire to play would probably increase. I wonder if the designer would contemplate issuing a basic set of rules without leaders and quite so many modifiers - this might speed things up a bit. I like the cards a lot - fantastic ideas and great system. The overall game system is also a clever one - just a bit too long for me.

Own but never played. I'd prefer a mounted mapboard, and by preferred, I mean that I need one. The game comes with two very large paper maps that must overlap. I used to think I have a good sized table, but I literally have no room for these maps. If they were mounted, it could at least hang over the edge. Anyhow, I'm a huge fan of Civilization and 7 Ages looks like Civ on steroids. If I could only play...

I'm really conflicted on this one.  I feel like I should be just loving it, as it's like the logical extension of the Britannia-HotW family of which I am particularly fond.
All of those games sport some significant playing time, to the point where if HotW gets a bit draggy, you can be staring 6 hours in the face. And here's 7 Ages, where a 6 hour game is but a crazy dream.  An all-weekend game doesn't scare me off in and of itself, but I'm not convinced there's really enough here to justify it.
I also had some minor concerns about fiddliness (sp.?), mostly from feeling like I was constantly flipping counters to find what I wanted.  This will probably fade with time, but is annoying now.
All that being said, I definitely enjoy how the game plays, so I'm leaving my rating at 7 pending further investigation.

I have tried many civilization-building games. This is the one I enjoy the best. I really like watching the changing global landscape and the rise and fall of various civilizations. Controlling a single civilization for 6000 years always did feel a little peculiar.

Played at GenghisCon 2007.  Very nice production, cool cards.  I can tell a lot of work went into this.  But it just was not that fun. Kind of like History of the World on steroids.  A lot of time investment to learn, a very long game to play.  We did not finish, but I did not really care if I did finish.  I can see this taking 10 hours to finish a game.  Not worth it.

Hooray. A game where you can be condemned to basically watching the others play for three hours just because of some event cards and not so lucky card draws. 

I will very likely never touch this again.

If you like a mix of conflict and civ building (I do!), you will likely enjoy this game. 

It is long - if you prefer games that you can finish in a single session, you may not enjoy this.

I keep thinking that this could be speeded up with some modernization of the action markers, similar to Race for the Galaxy or Puerto Rico, where the action chooser gets to do lots of things and the other players get to do some minor version of the action.

I love Civilization (the computer game series, not the board game) and this is a great offline-adaption of Sid Meier's stroke of genius. What I particularly like about 7 Ages is that no player ever falls behind without a chance of catching up again.
If you're looking for a large-scale strategy game with a lot of depth that also appeals to the "average gamer", this is your game!

RATING: 9
Brilliant game but too long to get played often. Or sometimes. You really need to have a space to 'stow it away' until the next session (which may be months later).

Also, it's not a strategic wargame, it's a tactical economic game. Don't start with the wrong impression ;)

We played for about 10 hours, got through about an age and a half. I will not say that the game length is a drawback. If you don't like long games, you should have stopped reading many reviews ago. I will echo what previous people have said about two other drawbacks. The cards drive victory, and combos can have a huge impact. The other point may or may not be a drawback. You must bash the leader. If a civilization is getting 7 or 8 glory each round, it has to be reduced or destroyed. I don't see this as a drawback, because the leader can start a new civilization when one starts to fade.

My gaming group attempted an all day Saturday play of 7 Ages recently. It was shocking how long it took  to progress in the game. Most of the time suck involved trying to lookup rules in either the rulebook, a player guide, or the errata. Many of the rules were pretty ambiguous, and I've got to say that the rulebook is not very helpful (and yes most of us had multiple readings beforehand, and we'd done an short test of the game on another occasion, so the mechanics were known). It felt as though 7 Ages was never play tested by an independent group, as the rules, errata, players guides, and faqs left just too many unanswered questions. Another annoyance was the duel use of named leaders and other types of tokens.  That kept us constantly digging through the leaders sheet to find an appropriate token. Many of the events seemed to be much too powerful, and overall I think there's too much luck to the game (with too much power to change the course of the game). It was too easy to overlook leaders abilities and artifact abilities. Overall, an interesting game, but ultimately frustrating. I think it could be salvaged with a lot of refinement, but frankly I don't feel it's worth it.

I think people are going overboard about this game, maybe the long lead in time has created unrealistic expectations. As a games is not bad but a 10 rating!!!!

The rules are not very clear and it was a few games before my group were playing it right.  The empires all appear to play more or less the same - You create and empire, spread out as much as your countermix will allow, then it gets battered by a new empire. Repeat many times.

Still I prefer it to history of the world and 6 rating means it isn't a bad game and it's one I will play again

RATING: 6.5
Can be a very long game. However, fairly straigh tforward and I've always found that it moves fairly quickly. It's biggest flaw (IMO) is that the card play gets too vindictive. Many of the cards have bad events which you inflict on another player and I've witnessed some very bad feeling because of this.
With the right people this is a very good game, in fact I'd score it 9. But without the right people it's down to a 2 or 3

Got talked into an "accelerated" game of this with the gentleman who came up with the game parameters because he was going to run it at a 'Con that weekend.  Also played with two other people who had never played the game before.  We were promised that we'd stop after 4 hours - which I knew was already too long for an "accelerated" game.  Spent most of the game asking "How does this work again?" and having absolutely no clue about combat, movement, production, or even when to play cards.  About an hour in, he started apologizing for the game, which, to me, tells me that if you have to do that for the remainder of the game, then you should give it up.  Even game designers know to give up once you bore your players to tears.

RATING: 3
Great Cards! Thats the best part of this game. The bad part is the game is brutally slow to play. I sat for 35 minutes and all I did was move 4 counters into adjacent territories! That was not an exception either, many of the turns took over an hour to play. The other thing I found hard to swallow was new civs popping up in the middle of another well established civ. To start a turn with nothing on the map, then birth, expand & demolish an already established civ before they are able to react in any way is simply goofy. My other complaint is the balancing of the civs, 3 folks in our game had 3 civs each and 3 had 2 civs...no suprise, the 3 with 3 got so far ahead that we quit playing. It also has a serious "Gang up on the Leader" side to it that I dislike in games. Summary: Some really great components, some good mechanics, couple really bad mechanics that spoil the whole batch.

WORST GAME EVER. If I could rate this a zero, I would.

For a game that takes so freaking long to play, it relies waaaaay too heavily on luck of the draw, with few chances for countermeasures.

There are civilization actions that make not a lick of sense. As a Civilize Action, a Christian civilization can force a pagan civilization on the opposite side of the globe to convert to Islam. WTF?!?! What nation has EVER mobilized its citizens to convert ANOTHER NATION to a religion the mobilized country does not have a strong following of?

Broken: Trading. Period. Numerous times, every player felt that if he chose Trade as a civilization's precious action, there was a 50% chance the other civilization would benefit, and the one who chose Trade would not. Even with Trade-boosting cards, there is a strong chance you get zip, the other civilization benefits, and you lost a card from your hand you might have been able to do something else with.

Gorgeous components, simple and elegant mechanics with the variety that a card game provides, and huge replayability.  This is packed with flavour and fun.  I especially liked the concept that the internet ends history and the game.

The huge maps will limit ftf play opportunities but pbem via ACTS might be an option.

The BIGGEST game I own to date, in regards to length of play. I really like the feeling of empires rising and falling through history, although the abilities of some of the cards feel oddly disconnected from the theme. This game requires a huge time commitment, but I still like it when I can rally the troops, so to speak. I always play with the "Redemption" optional rule.

RATING: 8
This game is what happens when you take [gameid=224] and made it into a sprawling, weekend-long affair.  This is a beast of a game that takes forever to play, and yet is surprisingly fast-flowing and easy to grasp.  It does an admirable job of simulating history, though there are awkward holes in it occasionally for the sake of gameplay.  Managing your empires is an agonizing affair, as you have to manage options.  You'll always be wishing to do three things simultaneously with your empire.  If you are looking for a truly epic sweep-of-history experience, this is a great choice.

(After 4 hours of 3 a player game with 2 newbies - got to end of Age 2)  There are meaningful decisions to be made, but there is a lot to keep track of and looking at player aides.  I am not interested in super long games.  At this point in time I prefer shorter games and if I want a Civ game, then I'd lean toward Vinci or Tempus.

Thought the idea look great.  Actual gameplay was meh - never really feeling like there was a flow and getting several of my friends to play was a non-starter.

This game is just too overwhelming for me. If I ever find fifteen hours that I can spend on one game and six other players willing to put the effort, I would much rather play b{[b]Civilization[/b]}b than this. There is just too much going on from the start, the cards have too much information in them, there are too many different units with too much information. This game is just too much.

Too long game ( > 30 h)
The game needs the errata/clarifications (good support in the Consimworld forum). The living rules (March '07) is not completed with all this documentation and still is necessary very much clarifications written in other sources.
With a perfect rules set and correctly written my vote would be a 9.
To ignore the fog of war rule (very bad and uncompleted rule and the game does not need it).
Is not a historical/simulation game but it was not the designer's target.

The History of the World game I have been waiting for! Not for everyone, as it has a considerable dose of complexity and length (although nothing like WiF). But well worth the effort. Currently working on a polished Cyberboard gamebox for it.

This is a provisional rating after one play.  We started with seven and two dropped out right away.  We (read as "I") got a couple of rules wrong but it didn't detract from the overall experience.  We played for 4.5 hours and got through two ages.  I'm dying to try it again.

very good idea. I was entusiastic to play the history of the world with rather a lot of detail (religions, government, leaders, military ecc.).

Beautiful. This game is...
Deep: you'll need some practice to fully comprehend and remember all rules, even if there are only 12 pages, but almost anyone will be able to play with some effort
Elegant: gameplay mechanics are just plain good, with almost no glitches, and allow 3 to 7 players to enjoy an interesting and challenging game every time
Beautiful: the cards are evocative and well drawn, the map is very nice and counters are just good.
The only improvements I could think of were:
1) SINGLE-SIDED counters, just for not having to search some counters on the backside of those already in play
2) and some more unit types
3) an included unit-organizer, I mean some sort of box to store units in by type... It takes a LOT of time to prepare a new set of units to be used with a newly started empire!
Bottom line: if you like history based and conquest games, you'll love 7 Ages. Otherwise, you'll probably start to like the genre...

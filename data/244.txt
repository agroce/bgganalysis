Mayhem! What a great multi-player game especially for game conventions and tournaments.  Lots of action, lots of tactics and lots of strategy.  Fast and agile to dodge the big boys and pull away or a wheeled dreadnought or something in between.  Whip your horses? Whip your opponent's horses?  Whip your opponent!?!

This game is a hoot with the right group of friends. But it falls into that uneasy category for me - style (theme) over substance. There is scant little to decide in this game - and so it's more an experience with friends than a game wherein you try to win. That takes away much of the fun for me.

Swift horses or plodders? A racing machine or road warrior? Such choices even before you start.The old style dice rolling charts slows it down until you know what's what. But a good friendly game of maim your opponent is always fun.

Circvs Maximvs is a 2 to 12 player game of low complexity. It's a fast-paced, action-packed, of ancient Roman chariot racing. Each player takes control of their horse-drawn chariots and compete against one another to be the first driver to make 3 labs around the Circus Maximus track. You customize and decide the capabilities of the driver, chariot and team of horses. Do you opt for a light chariot and fast horses, an experience rider with a heavy chariot, or is an evenly balanced team of driver and horses your best combination? There's pro and cons to all options. It all depends on your style, friendly race or an all out 'take no prisoners' match to the death.  As in Ben Hur, be wary of your competitor's ram and lash attacks. 

Expected playing time is about 1.5 - 2 hours.

One of my "old" favorite games from the 80ties. Played it quite often.
I made my own print and play game by using a xerox machine and colored paper, which I laminated. I still own this version.
It is a horse car racing gaming in the circus maximus. Durinh the race it is allowed to wipe your opponents from their cars...
Yes that was a lot of fun!

RATING: 7
It's a high luck game, so if you're serious and methodical, you probably want to run a series.  However even a single game is a lot of fun and can be pretty vicious, because it really does make sense to go after everyone else and try to bring them down.  This is a game that you want to play mean.

The tension does grip you as you're trying to make your way around the track.  Definitely better with more players.

With more than 3-4 players, this slows down quite a bit.

Rating may go up with more play.

This game can have some truly wonderful moments - my opponent attempts to ram my chariot, but his wheel comes off, his chariot flips, and lands on another chariot....  But once the chariots have spread out, you can tell who's going to win with half the race left.

I heart this game.  I have had a blast playing it every time, except when there are not enough players to make it crazy fun.  Added some rules about young boy stretcher bearers that moved onto the track to cart away fallen riders, made some chits for them too.  Great fun running them over.  Fun!

This is one of the games that seems to have stood the test of time well. Sure it is ugly as hell and the rules have errors and ambiguities in them. But the game itself, while being somewhat random, is a higly interactive and immersive experience. After two turns you forget you are pushing chits around and feel you are in the arena hearing the crowd yell out for blood. As I've only played the basic game yet, I can only imagine what the advanced rules will add. But the basic game is a blast. A real old fashioned dicefest blast! Highly recommended!

I was trying to get the experience of what it would be like to be Judah Ben-Hur riding his chariot during my first play of this game. What I got was the feeling of being an accountant studying for his final exam to get his CPA.

 With all the resolution tables and math, it felt clunky and overwrought. Due to it's chaotic and random nature, the game should have moved along a little faster. I'm sure that with subsequent plays it would be a more positive experience and shine for me, but for what the game brings I'm not sure I want to invest the time or effort to make it happen.

Maybe if the components were better produced it would capture my interest a bit more.

RATING: 7.5
With two convention plays (one w/ 10 players, one w/ 18), I found this one of the more exciting games around.  Very, very long, though (10 players went for 5 hours to complete 3 laps).  Winning strategy seems to be enemy horse-bashing, and ruthless whipping of your own horses.  The campaign rules we used (variant rules?) allowed for runaway leaders whose 5- & 6-speed horses broke quickly from the pack and were uncatchable, so I'm hoping a new edition might fix that...  someday.

RATING: 8
My favorite racing game so far!  Lots of decisions, and more control over movement than games like Formula De or McGartlin.  ...And so very, very dark -- should you ram your opponent's chariot, or would it be more fun to lash-attack his horses in the corner to push them into a possible chariot flip?  Best played with somebody who knows it well, otherwise the session turns into a series of rules consultations.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I've faded a bit on this one.  The initial die role for team speed is a big factor.  The balance seems off.  Seems that the "waterbugs" (light and speedy) win the race.  Those driving heavies don't go after the waterbugs since they can't get near them, so there is no targeting the leader, just those who could possible get near the leaders...

AAArgh! The rules require a flow chart or you are forever reading the text.

Once familiar this is a great wargame, masquerading as a chariot race. This means it can be played at two levels either a tactical race game or a destroy-the-opponent challenge.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Ugly as mortal sin, plagued by fiddly old-time AH rules, enough charts to make an actuary sigh blissfully -- but by Jupiter, is it ever fun!

The rules, long and messy though they are, are really pretty simple once you get going, and the choices!  Take a light, fast chariot and just try to run so fast no one can catch you?  Take a slow behemoth, load it up with scythe blades, and try to chop up your opponent's horses with 'em?  Take a highly skilled driver and try to avoid trouble while everyone else takes each other out, and then amble to the finish line over the corpses?  All these choices and more are open to you; any style of play is possible, if not necessarily successful.  But you can have as much fun losing this game as winning many others, so it's all good.

The amazing thing about this game, with its great age and horrid graphic design, is it manages that most Ameritrash of concepts -- immersiveness.  You are IN that race, YOUR horses are being trampled, YOU'RE the one flying through the air as your chariot flips (to the chants and cheers of your opponents.)   The adrenoline rush is astonishing.  Just got a new copy of this (to replace my badly beaten one), and can't wait to get it on the table again.

I have only played this game once. It was at a sci-fi convention in Winnipeg.  I remember not knowing anything about the game when sitting down to play, but the guy in charge just said to tell him what I want to do and he'd do it. I think I managed to complete one lap before my beasts where killed. I then jumped onto a passing chariot and completed another half lap before I killed those beasts and then myself. It was lots of fun.

Alright, let's take Ave Caesar.  It's a decent game- easy to play, fun if you're up for something light and sorta dirty in that Euro "not really all that dirty" way.  Yet it could really be about any kind of racing (such as say, race cars or "Q-Jets").  There's nothing in the game that really makes it a Ben Hur-style chariot race other than the art.  Now let's look at Circus Maximus.  It couldn't be anything other than a Ben Hur-style chariot race- it creates a vivid, cinematic, and detailed experience that's likely as close to the subject matter as we're likely to ever get.  It's easy to get scared away by the god-awful board (which has more CRT-style charts on it than it does actual play space) and crude components but it's also easy to get into and easy to play once you've taken a turn or two.  It is _very_ old timey, what with the crazy rules that will have you trying to remember whether to roll 2D6 or 3D6 at a particular point and all, but the tradeoff is that it's very specific- you can get your right or left eye whipped out, chariots can be rammed, horses killed, and you may find yourself running across the lanes on foot to try to escape the track!  It can also run a little long- usually the kiss of death for most race games- but with so much drama and destruction going on the time melts away.  This is a real classic; sure, it could use some cleaning up here and there and that board is practically an argument against old-school games in and of itself but if you're interested in confrontational, dramatic games that create a sense of narrative then your patience with it will be duly rewarded.

Ancient ameritrash as it worst with die-hard fans.

Aesthetically disgusting and mechanically boring. It has a tone of rules, but the game is at the same time repetitive and random. Everything is resolved on die rolls but usually the tables make no sense and the outcomes are puzzling. 
Many things are flawed in this game, even the racing track design becomes obviously flawed after running one lap on it.

The first game was quite fun as a grupal nonsensical experience, but it is nothing I will try again.

Some of my fondest gaming memories are associated with this one. It always reminds me of that old ABC sports commercial featuring "the thrill of victory, the agony of defeat" bit. From such glorious heights have a stumbled! Then again, to win against such odds is a thrill, especially in a tournament environment (Origins 1998 baby!). Heck, any game where you can achieve victory while being dragged by a team of frothing horses is just golden. Too bad it is so damned ugly out of the box.

Avalon Hill.  FLIP, FLIP, FLIP!  I'm not so much into playing this game for the campaign as I am for playing a big race BEN HUR style!!!  If you've ever seen the movie, it is a great description of the chaos and crazy race nature of gladiator charioteers racing laps in a big oval Roman style dirt race track.  This game is fun to play and sometimes is not about winning but seeing how many "victims" you can take out with your chariot before the end of the race.  Even though this is an Avalon Hill game, it is fairly easy to play and fun for teenagers through adults.

Oozing with theme and loads of fun. The AH redesign of the original Battleline version used the Speed Circuit mechanism of allocating points.

Exceedingly entertaining game with large groups. A game that inspires the Roman in each of us to cheer at blood gore and excess. If it was not for any of this I think this game would fall flat on its face. The game play itself is a bit mechanical I find. This often discourages me from playing, especially since the infrequent game play it receives entails reading these typically obtuse old school Avalon Hill rules everytime we play. Too much verbiage for a game with this little of complexity.

Great entertainment with plenty of players. My daughters have taken a liking to the 'combat' aspect of this race game, so it may see a surge in the number of plays. A relatively easy game to learn. Made even more enjoyable with some additional rules in an issue of The General. (Vassal)

As realistic as racing chariots can get. Offers: Ramming other chariots or horses, whipping their horses/drivers, taking sharp curves over safe speeds, cutting loose dead horses, drivers getting knocked silly, driver getting knocked out of chariot and dragged behind it and more!  What's not to like?  There is practically every possible outcome of a chariot race simulated in this game.  This game is chock full of theme.  That said, it has so much going on, that it can drag as you spend time trying to figure out what to do.  Also, most outcomes are solely the result of a dice roll   modifier.  So if you don't roll well, it will be a short day at the races for you.  Only played once but look forward to next play.

The game seemed fine enough, but the numerous tables that you had to cross-reference in order to do anything kind of took some of the fun out of the game. Maybe this is due to my pre-conceived notions, but if I am going to play a racing game I want it to be (no pun intended) fast and furious, not an exercise in accounting.

The Grand Old Man of horse racing games, only *more violent*!  What&#039;s not to love about this venerable old title?  Crashing wheels into your competitors, trying to whip the driver blind while taking the corners at break-neck speeds - it&#039;s got everything.
Of course, you haven&#039;t really played this game until you&#039;ve gone to DonCon and used the big tracks and lead miniatures!

RATING: 6.5
This game tries to simulate Roman chariot races in detail. Each player has a sheet marking the endurance of the chariot, the type of the chariot, whether your driver carries a whip and a list of data to be used in the race. A light chariot gives speed but has no defense to bullying from others, a heave scythe chariot has a lot to envy but does not guarantee a winner. For some, after reading the rules, this game might sacrifice playability to so much detail. Still the results are accurate and the race is interesting. The more players the better. The winner of course is the one crossing the finish line after 3 tours of the hippodrome field.

Played long ago, and remember the great laughs I had! Chariots losing wheels, getting destroyed, turning upside down flying on the air and killing the horses of the chariot ahead when landing... Good fun!! I won several races by way of sacrificing one of my chariots while doing all the damage it could; and finishing first with the other one.

RATING: 8
Great fun when it first came out 20+ years ago, but it's far too rules heavy and takes too long by modern game design standards - especially considering the subject matter.  But therein lies an interesting conundrum.  There have been several attempts to design simple fast-playing chariot racing games in recent years, that have all delivered disappointly lackluster results.  The magic of Circus Maximus lies in its extreme level of detail, which of course, is why it's so rules heavy.  So if you're willing to make the intellectual and play-time investment, you'll be generously rewarded with an extremely engaging and entertaining game.

I can see it working as a convention game where the fun is not so much in the playing but in the social interaction. It captures the cinematic flavour and that is good enough to get some laughs. 

But as a race game, not so good. The key to winning is not to get involved in combat but there's all these rules about combat which is meant to spice up the game! Apart from this contradiction, the game is way too long, which can get repetitive and has the situation where players can be effectively eliminated but still have to continue playing (not very fun). 

Also room for gamey tactics, which detracts from the so-called "realism" (so-called because it's not really realistic but a Hollywood version of realistic).

[2 plays] Ultra fabulous day at the Roman chariot races!

How did I ever convince seven of my highschool friends (some of them girls, even) to play an entire season of this? The rules are extra-fiddly, and, in fine Avalon Hill style, there are a metric baggyload of tiny cardboard chits. On the plus side, the player interaction is great, with lots of chariot-bashing in-race and skullduggery (horse doping!) pre-race in the stables. Works great as a one-race-a-week marathon with wagering. Enjoy the theme and let one person geek out on the fiddly stuff for everyone else's sake--who knew going around a turn required sooooo many rules?

 As a matter of time spent playing games in my teenage years, I must have played this game 60 times solitaire. I named the drivers of the chariots, kept win, place and show records and kept records of how much money the factions had. I had so much fun I used all the logs, I wore out the counters and the game board ripped 1/2 a part. The current location of my prior copy is unknown but I suspect it ripped apart in so many places that it disappeared or Mom threw it away not realizing it was a game. Cannot really blame Mom under the circumstances and cannot prove it, but it is the most humorous explanation consistent with the facts.

A decent game with great theme but somewhat tedious gameplay.  It suffers from the fact that the optimal strategy seems to involve very little bloodshed - and the fun of this game is in the bloodshed.  The mayhem is ramped up dramatically if players play two chariots each, but that also ramps up the tedious bookkeeping and space-counting.  One other issue: some forms of attack are clearly superior to others, leading to less variety.  It's a game that shows its age, and a perfect candidate to be republished in a streamlined and updated edition.

RATING: 4
The Ur-Game from which all other chariot games are derived. Lots of grit in the system and plenty of charts, but worth soldiering through if you're interested in the subject matter. Always seems to play itself out as two races, between the rabbits at the front of the pack actually trying to win the race, and the destruction derby at the back, between the guys in the heavy chariots bashing and lashing themselves into oblivion. The campaign game looks intriguing but I can't see as I'll ever play it -- even twenty-five years ago when I first got this game, I didn't have that kind of time.

Great multiplayer fun...for one lap.  Does anyone ever make it beyond that?  It's always one we drag out for a quick play when we're together as a group (GenCon once a year?).  Heavy Chariot with a +2 Driver if you're in a combat heavy group.  Endurance...what's that good for in a bloodfest?

Ah, nothing like the smell of fear on the track. Circus Maximus is the game of Roman Chariot racing. Wheeling your little buggy around the track simultaneously trying to beat your opponents and          trying to...er...beat them is very entertaining. Razor sharp cartwheel hubcaps, cutting dead horse flesh from your rig, and being dragged across the finish line sans buggy are all part of the fun.

This race game needs a lot of players to make it fun. But a cornucopia of fiddly rules means it's not easy to teach, so there's a serious chicken-and-egg problem.

The gameplay itself is chaotic, with player elimination a very distinct possibility. At least one of my games has ended with a single chariot trotting sedately over the line.

This game...really needs a good polishing to the rules to hold up to the modern standard of boardgaming. As is, it is far too complex for what it should be. It's a racing game, but it has this old-timey wargame feel to it thanks to the mechanics involved with attacking and going around corners at certain speeds. It's hard to imagine why I would want to play this over Formula D...other than you get to whip people as you pass by in this one.

Played with three two chariots each ( rules say 3,3, and 2)

I had really bad modification roles. Rolling ones on speed and sixes on endurances for both my teams.

For this reason I will use the following house rule for my next games. the first modification roll you do is free. You decide after you have rolled where to assign it to. Reason for this is that it is a lot less fun if you have to play a game with a  non competetive chariot. Second reason is that because it is more competetive there will be al ot more chariot fights and I think that is what the game is about.


Wasn't sure i wanted to go full speed from the get go. But I think it is not a bad decision to do so from the get go.

Decided to take some risks while the race was progressing and had quite some fun.

I can see this being even more fun when there are 8 chariots in the race. 

The one problem I had with it is that all meaningfull combat occured only during the first lap of the race. And we had one run away leader, followed by a safe second spot and even the third place was confirmed after the first lap.
The real battle occured at the end of the race where I got trampled just before the last corner

I think that this is one of the more enjoyable "old school" Avalon Hill games.  It has a lot of die rolling, too much downtime, a few too many charts and plays a bit long, but, unlike many games of its era, it retains the hard to quantify "fun factor" despite its flaws.  The combat greatly livens up this racing game and raises it above most games of that genre for me.

RATING: 6
The game can be said to be realisitic but I am not fond of its gamey mechanic (particularly the random going). The method of turning in the racing ground corner also appears to be arbitrary at first. But soon I found it a simple simulation of how you must keep your horses tight in a corner to turn. For a 3-round only game turn, it turns out to be the inflict of loss is less than I would have thought. Bascailly it is more like a race game than a killing thing as I originally imagine. Overall, it is a fun game for some laughters.

Did a demo in the local shopping mall back when I was in radio, using a huge 3D track and HO scale Airfix chariots; I got to stand on a chair (to be able to see the board) and do play by play for the spectators. It drew a gigantic crowd. Great times!

Destroyed my brothers, and then while he was attempting to run out of the arena, I ran him down! LOL! I went on to win with my light chariot. Was a fun night! I recently bought an unpunched shrink wraped Circus Maximus off ebay for $40. Can't wait to play again!

Very much a realistic-complexed game for advanced gamers. The only thing that I'm disappointed in, is the cheap little counters, almost laughable, that take away from the realism. I made custom horses and detachable chariots made out of wood to make it more realistic. one half of what makes a game fun is the components.

An absolute riot - there's nothing more fun than whipping some other guy's horses around a turn to push their speed above the limit or riding down some crashed driver, who is desperately running for the edge of the course.

Classic chariot race game, and a very typical race game of its time. (i.e., very much out of the classic '70s AH/ SPI mold, although it's not that hard to play. I would say a fair amount of rules overhead, again, typical for the time)

Can be very cutthroat, but hey, it's Rome.

Would really like to play this one again soon, it's been a long time.

A decent game, but a bit slow and clunky for chariot racing.  Certainly doesn't conjure up the feeling of being in a fast paced race.  Players who want furious excitement should probably play something else as this is a little dry and geeky.  Formula De is a much better racing game.

Keep the numerous charts handy while you play - I'd be lost if I hadn't made my own player aids as each form of attack is resolved differently. This game needs to be streamlined.

Probably best if played as an ongoing campaign where you can sabatoge, bet and level up your racing teams over the course of several races.

I would probably rate this game higher if I were using painted miniatures as some players do.  The components are rather dull.

Caveat: I have only played solitaire and 2-player.  Considering this is a multiplayer game my opinion may have less weight?

A very good game that can handle a lot of players.  Of course the problem is finding enough people to play.  Not to good unless at least six people involved.

Really no other options to catch up once your behind.

Sheer, unadultered chaos with horses, whips, and chariots.  We love playing this game when everyone's in the mood for some creative destruction for a large number of players.

However, the game does suffer a bit from length, and can encourage some strategies that irk many players (like the heavy chariots purposely holding back to knock the lights that flew ahead out).  Throw in that it's an elimination game and it can be hard to go with this over other games for a similar number of players.

Sure, it's clunky, a little long, and could use mechanical and cosmetic updates, but it's still a great play. Spend points to set up your chariot (light, medium, heavy), team speed, driver, endurance. Plot your speed then get ready to ram your opponents on the way by. Prefer Speed Circuit overall, but then you can't whip a rival driver.

A really fun, "take that" game. Who doesn't love a game with four kinds of attacks, scythed wheels, getting dragged behind your chariot, and crashing out and landing on your opponent? And oh yeah, there's a race too.

Bought it from Germany through Ebay... Played a 6p game recently, and the game is FUN!!! We'll have to see how many times this game will get played, but the rating will likely rise.

BTW: We only played the basic game. We almost always skip directly to advanced games, once we've found them somewhere in the rulebook, but this amount of text needed to be absorbed more slowly...

Grandísimo juego de carreras en el que además de correr te tienes que pegar.
Dependiente mucho de los resultados de los dados, pero con dosis de estrategia y planificación, transmite muy bien la tensión que se produce durante la partida.
Perfecto para risas y piques.
El aspecto añejo de los materiales me gusta mucho, pero no es lo más sobresaliente del juego.

I've only played it once.  I knocked over another chariot on essentially the very first turn.  This type of player elimination could be a big problem, if there is nothing else for the eliminated player to do.  There are lots of charts.  It would probably be best to learn this game from an expert.

Chariot racing.  Just the subject implies a fun game.  This game must be played after watching the chariot race in Ben Hur (the greatest scene ever filmed IMO).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Unpunched.  

A local convention has a large scale copy of this that you play with Lego chariots.  It usually gets played more for mayhem than for racing.  Of course they have incorporated a bunch of house rules for weapons and combat that now make this only somewhat resemble the original game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
I've played twice.  once, it was nothing but an argument.  The second time, we played with a house rule where you aren't allowed to attack horses.  The game actually became fun at that point.  Go figure.  Certainly not a great game, but not a waste either.  Still too many dice rolls though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Good rules for single races and league play.  Also some cool expansion rules in the Avalon Hill house magazines that are worth looking for.  The one downside is that it's entirely possible to get eliminated in the early goings of the race, leaving you with nothing to do for the rest of this long, long game.

I cannot understand the low rating for this game.  This was one of the first wargames that I ever played and then owned next to my A&A.  I love this game.  Very bloody, lots of action, many of ways to win!  Also, fairly easy to understand and explain to first-time players.  On its content, I'd rate this a 9, however, due to sentimental reasons and fond memories, I've gotta rate it a 10!  If you can find a copy, buy it and enjoy!!!

One of the games on my short list of games to get just in case we ever find the right group.  Although I think it's because of being able to destroy chariots, laugh as the rider desperately tries to cut himself free, and then when he finally does so you run him down.  Not exactly an accurate simulation but that is covered in the designers notes.

I really enjoy this game.  I have the 1980 AH version (not the earlier one that included Gladiator), so this review is for the racing game only.

I love racing games, and I enjoy the quirky details with this one, which allow you to whip or cut other horses or other drivers, or to damage lighter chariots, etc.  There's even rules for such things as cutting loose a dead horse from your team or cutting yourself loose if you're being dragged after your chariot flipped.

This game is fun to play at home with a group of friends.  But it gets even better at game conventions, when it's played on a custom-built large edition with miniatures of chariots as game pieces, and a couple of dozen players all chanting "FLIP!  FLIP!  FLIP!" as someone rolls to see if his chariot can continue unscathed for another round.

This game is dripping with Theme. The most random aspect of the game is the Steward draw on each round for the horse order. But since the game is played 'simultaneously', this is really not so much randomness. The dice rolls for everything are based on probabilities with some really exciting results. And all the tables are laid out for everyone to see and scrutinize.

Quite possibly my favorite racing game that I've played thus far.  Although the rules were daunting at first, they really do serve to bring out the theme of a chaotic and violent chariot race where anything goes.  While I'm no fan of confrontations, the ability to ram and attack the other players definitely added a lot more to the experience than just your mundane roll and move type of gameplay.

Even though downtime seemed to be unavoidable as the number of participants increases, the repetitiveness of each turn could be remedied by shortening the session to 2 laps.  I really do wish there was a more elegant way of determining the play order instead of drawing those chits over and over again.

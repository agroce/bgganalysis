Picked this little gem up on a whim at the friendly local game shop. Looked like it could be fun and was less that $20 bucks. But there is definitely more than $20 worth of game in that little box. A tight , short resource management game with combat. I can hear the Eurogamers now. "Combat in a resource management game! How dare you?!" 
I jest of course. We are coming to enjoy Euros now but that's beside the point. 
The component quality is ... random I guess is the best word. The cards are medium stock and ought to be sleeved. But there are these awesome metal coins in the box as well as tiny little meeples. Grab it up if you see a copy. It will surprises you.

Lovely little two-player game that's basically a 4X distilled down to the "Exterminate!" portion. Has some legit strategic and tactical depth, and forces you to move fast; punch your opponent in the face and punch them often, or they're gonna cruise to an easy win.

Your strategy is largely dependant on the cards you get, and I wouldn't mind if the game played a bit longer and had more room to breathe. Still, it's fun, it's fast, and it's gonna show up on our table very frequently.

Only played twice, but game development seems to the same.  One player takes the lead in settling (which is easy to math out) and forces the other player to attack two to three turns before the mathematical end of the game.  This attack is either successful, giving that player the same lead in settling, or unsuccessful, in which the original leader wins.  The variety of cards influences your choices somewhat, but there does not seem to be long term strategy.

Kickstarted - 4 player Version

Expansions:
- Island Siege: Coquina 
- Island Siege: Rampart

So we played 4 games of this with two players... In every game the player who went first won. There doesn't seem to be a high enough percentage of boats in the deck for it to mean anything.

I'm off to look through the geek to see if we were playing this wrong.

Update - 4-8/2014
Played this using the correct rules (you can always attack even if you don't have a ship built). It plays much better this way. I'd actually play it again if someone brought it to the table or saw it in my collection and wanted to play it. Although I'm not sure I'd ever bring it to be played.

RATING: 6
This is actually a fun little game that is marred principally by the win conditions, which can create a "tug-of-war" situation that drags the game out past its welcome. I like the theme, I liked the drafting and the various abilities of the cards, and the "leveling" up engine that you build as you place colonists out was very elegant and simple. Since the game basically requires constant attacking, it was not a game for me and my husband, but I may look to reacquire this in the future if I could find a regular person to play it with. Sold.

This fun little game is filled with some unique mechanics and back and forth strategy. It's compact, the dice are big,  and the cards are pretty nice. As you build stuff you gain  points and abilities, while trying to maintain what you have and preventing the other player from advancing by attacking their stuff. Everything works nicely together and the two ways to win are very clever. It's a filler worth playing.

Island Siege is a fast-playing game of fort-building and colonization in the Caribbean Sea. Players build shore-side forts to defend their colonists from attack and to score points. Forts allow you to put colonists in play, which in turn can safely build ships and buildings which provide abilities and points. Attacking allows you to chip away at your opponent's fort while gaining cubes which are used to build forts of your own. Your goal is to score 20 coins or get all of your colonists in play!

Cool ideas and great components but the few games we played had serious issues with pacing. A couple games ended in only a few turns and other games took WAYYY too long. Would like to see this design refined - the "cube" building wall mechanic is intresting. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.5
Based on four plays with two players:

This is a fun, fast, interesting game with a really good combination of mechanics. My only criticism of the game-play is that in the later stages of the game you often have no choice about your action; you have to attack in order to stop your opponent from winning. However, the push-your-luck, dice-rolling attack mechanic means that this is still an engaging process.

In short, I have really enjoyed all of my plays of this game so far and look forward to playing it more, I would probably rate it at least a 6.5 BUT my rating is tempered by the price-point, contents and production values:

In UK shops the game retails for £25. For a fast, light two player game with relatively few components I would expect to pay around £15 - perhaps £20 at the outside. Yes, it does contain 13 very high quality metal coins - and yes, they are awesome - but they're not £5-10's worth of awesome. The card-stock is cheap, the player boards are flimsy and low quality, the dice are self-assembly and the sticker sheets for them are poorly printed.

Finally; though there are rules available online to make this a two to four player game, as shipped it is only for two players. In the rules you are recommended to combine two copies of the game to add more players. £50 for a half hour filler? I think not.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A nice, quick 2-player duel with neat little metal coins. It's not especially deep, but it offers several interesting decision points. It can get stuck in a back-and-forth, but not for long due to the economic win condition, which cleverly puts a timer on the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
After 2 games, I'm still not sure about this game. The rules are simple and I get some of the feedback loops that are built in, but I'm not sure how to play well. The game seems to thrive on people making minute mistakes and ending almost right away.
I'm still thinking about it, so that's a good sign and I'll definitely play again at least 4-5 games. There is something there, here's hoping that it's really a good game.

Very very enjoyable but the Pirates of the Caribbean game gives the same feel, and in trying to trim the fat in the collection I have to give this one up even with the shorter play time and the smaller footprint. We love the Pirates films, and associated memories, and can't part with that one. Thanks to BGG user Ackiatta for an amazing trade experience.

A super fun cards and dice game for 2 players only. At first the rulebook was incredibly difficult to decipher and it took a while to get going, but once you get the game it's quite intuitive. Lots of thinking in which actions to take next, and I have to say that for 2 people who are very peaceful and in no way warlike, it is surprisingly fun to blow the heck out of each others' forts :angry: :D Contains cute mini meeples :meeple: and ships  and the most awesome metal coins. The price is quite steep for the size though. It's a filler with the cost of (especially with the expansions) a big box game. Bought from one of my favourite online game stores.

RATING: 9.1
A stunningly good game!  If you want a truly engaging, 2-player, 30-minute slap-fest filler with meaningful decisions and just a sprinkle of luck, don't think twice: Grab it hot off the shelf.

It's the best two-player game since the likes of Kahuna, Starfarers of Catan, Perry Rhodan, Jaipur and Aton.  It's like a more involving Court of the Medici.

If you liked any of the games I've mentioned, I'm all-but-certain that you will LOVE this one.  I would always play it and always recommend it.  Well done, Dan Manfredini!

P.S.  I've looked at the 3-4 player rules expansion and don't think it's a good fit.  For me, this will remain a delicious 2-player experience.  I have, however, designed my own new ship cards (I keep all of the cards in sleeves, so the backs can't be seen) to enrich the game further.

Check out the VARIANT forum for my free 9-card expansion!

How can a game this small be this good?  The fort configurations and gameplay are so well thought out and interesting!  The production value is off the charts too; I have never played a game where the money was this impressively made.  It has been a long, long time since I've felt delighted immediately when playing a new game.

Looking forward to possibly playing a 4-player game with two copies.

This game is easily playable in 20 minutes.  For games under half an hour, this is near the top of the heap!

After a bunch more plays, the game feels fairly flawed in that it's extremely hard to catch up once you fall behind.  I still think it's fun, but the initial shine has worn off a bit.

I played my PNP Version and there came some rule questions up. I am not sure the pnp rules are really final, as the resulting impression was mixed. It is a thin line between that rules make a short and spicy game or they make the game drag. I found it too easy to actually destroy a fort. Neither player was able to build more than one building because forts were that quickly destroyed. This is a set back for the players and game goes on for longer.

I almost kickstarted this game but finances were really tight and I could not justify spending the money at the time.

I have played this with 2, 3 and 4 players and it scales very well. I really like the decisions that the dice offer, and the balance between building your own forts and attacking others. There is a lot of interaction with other players but it does not feel like a "take that" kind of game because of the many different ships, forts, and other buildings that you can build. Also, having two different ways to win adds a lot tension and excitement to the end game.

[b]Impressive, quick playing dice and card game of building and attacking colonial forts in the Caribbean.[/b]
r{[i]Great art and custom coins enhance enjoyable back and forth struggle of this two player gem. [/i]}r

SYNOPSIS
Players alternate building, drawing cards or attacking opponent’s forts in this compact dice and card game with the ultimate goal of achieving either an economic or colonist victory. Forts built from players' collections of varied cubes defend colonists which are added each turn to unlock benefits over time and possibly achieve victory. Drawing cards provides new forts, reinforcement buildings and/or ships to add to your fleet along with the decision of which one of the three drawn cards to pass to your opponent. Attacking by a Yahtzee-style roll of dice targets your opponent’s cube defenses to ultimately destroy their forts and fleet, sending colonists away and slowing their growth, while also providing the means of collecting resource cubes for building new forts of your own. Players may alternately claim economic victory by gaining 20+ coins from putting cards into play.

COMMENTS
I enjoy the ebb and flow of Island Siege which usually proves to be a quick exercise in balancing attacks with growth. There’s a charming quality to this impressive design that shines through in its great artwork, balanced game play and short play time that begs for repeated plays. The game has just the right amount of randomness with its sometimes anguishing and sometimes exhilarating dice rolls and card pulls. Plus, there’s room for clever plays and surprising outcomes. As an added bonus the expansion cards integrate very well with the base game, adding a tad more variety and a new type of resource cube for building forts.

PROS+, CONS- & NOTES*
+ Except for starting forts, all cards are unique and provide different abilities.
+ Great artwork enhances the theme.
+ Lavish custom coins included with game.
- Stickered dice while serviceable don’t measure up to game’s other quality components.
* Expect a “take that” nature of attacking and randomness of die rolls.
* Two expansions add more cards and new defense to forts.

There are many games that claim to pack a lot of game in a small box, and this one can boast that as well. It's dead simple to learn, it plays briskly, and yet offers up a satisfying game. You build stuff, you attack, you experience setbacks, you have different strategies. It's a really nice little game.

Game in a Nutshell: Roll dice, build forts, then destroy your neighbor's...

Played as: 3 player

Pros: Has a few nice tricks to limit turtling and keep the action moving. Definitely a cool theme in the same vein as the old Rampart style of video games where it's fun to build but way more fun to blow stuff up.

Cons: I lost what was initially the biggest draw, the theme, in the abstract-ness of the game mechanics ("what are my options?", "how do I repair?", etc). After that, it felt like I was rolling to match dice. There's ways to gain special abilities but unfortunately they only seem to slow the pace and further abstract the experience.

Other: This all is based on a single demo play with prototype artwork. For as simplistic as it might sound, there must be something more to it because the designer just flat destroyed us. I'm full well willing to admit that it might be unfair to rate the game given I never fully grasped the details of it; but I think, for a game that should be fast, uproarious, and fun, it shouldn't take more than one play to get there. I'd be happy to try it again, because this is a theme and game that has been begging to be made.

Best Use: Players who thought there was something worthwhile in King of Tokyo, but found it too simplistic and cartoon-y.

Some interesting ideas in this little box- the use of colored cubes in various combinations, for one.

Very poor dice ...labels missed cut and too small for dice face ...which has totally put me off the game ...what a shame but dice quality is an important aspect to me especially when they integral to the game and can't be replaced with better quality dice ...should have spent money on dice not coins !

I have since got four blank chesses dice the same size as the labels ...the white bleed on the stickers blends much better against the white dice background ...the dice cost me $1.50 ...these dice would have been better in this game if the publishers insisted on using sticker dice ...for a small two player game that retails at $29.99 some one has pocketed a lot of money somewhere along the line ...

The game itself rates a solid 8 for game play  but rightly or wrongly  I am so upset by the dice I am not going to lift the rating ...

Plus asked the publishers for new labels ...not heard a thing ...I will be very careful  and really check out components of any future Ape games before or if I buy ...

After years of owning this game, it's still my favourite two-player game. It has a little bit of everything - dice rolling, card drafting, building, battling, and it plays in about 30 minutes. There is a lot of fun and strategy in that little box - we've now had to sleeve our cards. My only complaint is the shoddy quality of the dice - just black cubes with stickers that we put on ourselves. If Ape games makes some new dice we will be the first to buy them! Don't overlook this little gem of a game - my partner and I stumbled upon it by accident and are so glad we did!

A nice filler with great coins.  Even though there is luck with the dice, there are interesting decisions to make early in the game.  Giving a card to your opponent every time you get cards is one of them.  When to build forts when you are short on resources is another one.  Towards the end of the game, the decisions become more obvious, but the game is quick enough that it does not drag.

Played one game and we liked it quite a lot. I like the 2 paths to victory and you really need to keep an eye on your opponent's money. The combat system is interesting and I like that you are forced to combat when you see your opponent is only a couple of meeples to victory.

I normally don't include price value in comments but the game retails about $10 too much for what you get. The metal coins are awesome, but the cards are a bit thin and for the price I would have liked to have seen bigger meeples and bigger ships and too bad it only plays two. (But on the flip side the compact nature of the game and small box is kind of nice.)

I was really not expecting to like the game, but it is brutally fast while being full of hard decisions.  The small amount of luck is in the form of "reroll your luck" with quite a bit of control, and the cards are very well balanced.  So, there's just enough uncertainty to avoid computation, but skill is dominant over chance.  A gem!

Fun light game that's easy to carry around. It has a pretty well implemented "take that" mechanic that doesn't make the game last forever. Basically, it comes with an alternate win condition that's slower than the main win condition but isn't affected by any part of the game's "take that" mechanic.

Edit: Played a few games where the luck elements impacted the game way more frequently than they had any right to. Probably not going to hold on to this game for long. Did consider keeping it around for new gamers, but text on cards slows things down a lot.

Played a prototype recently. Island Siege has very clever mechanics. The highest praise I can think of is to liken it to For Sale and Puerto Rico - two other games that give you plenty of *meaningful* decisions. I only played it twice, but IIRC on your turn you can choose one of the following: draw cards (and choose two to keep and one to give to an opponent), build a ship, build a building, build a fort (usually lots of choices on how to build the fort) or attack an opponent's fort. If you attack you get to choose which dice to reroll. Unlike other games where you just reroll misses and keep hits Island Siege's six die faces all have meaning even if they aren't hits and frequently it isn't obvious which dice to keep and which to reroll.

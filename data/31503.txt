1st play: Our first game was a bit chaotic as we didn't have all the rules right.  Once we did get the rules right, I actually had fun playing this game - but that was mostly due to the table talk.  Everyone was laughing and having a good time, but mostly because we kept screwing each other with lots of points (bad thing).  Quick and harmless, fun with the right group.

This is sort of the same game as Category 5 or 6 Nimmt!, but frankly the cards in this version are VERY hard to read (66 and 99 not marked well) due to the font chosen by the developer.  The theme really does nothing and actually takes away from the game.  If you have a choice, pick up Category 5 or 6 Nimmt! instead.

A quick filler which can be easily taught to non-gamers.  Plays fast and has some interesting decisions to make in terms of card value choices.  Is a bit random, but that's just part of the fun.

RATING: 7
Rating based on just one play.  

I liked this a lot and I could see my rating increase.  It has an interesting tension trying to figure out which card will avoid you taking a hit -- or when you should intentionally take a small hit so you don't take a bigger one later.

RATING: 7
Fun game.  I like the mechanics a lot.  I've only ever played 6 nimmt! on BSW, but this is exactly the same.  I'd give it an 8, but the cards are pretty flimsy.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Flimsiest. Cards. [i]Ever[/i]. The game definitely loses a point for that. And what was wrong with the old scoring rules ("game over when someone gets past 66")?

Still, a hell of a lot of card-sliding fun. Lots of laughter.

Received from Daddys_Home as part of Chain of Generosity.  Thanks Adam.

My 10-year-old daughter looked at the cards for 1-2 minutes and had the card number vs. skier scoring pattern of the cards figured out.  I hadn't even noticed that there was a pattern yet, only that the colors matched the number of skiers.

RATING: 7
Not a big fan of card games, but this is a nice filler for groups small and large.  Strategy is difficult to create and more based on luck of the selection of others, but you still feel like you have some control of which avalanches you can effect from time to time.  Easy and quick to learn.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Slide 5 (after only a few plays I admit) just doesn't seem to click with my group.  It has some advantages in that it plays quickly and can engage 10 people without feeling broken.  It just doesn't feel like your DOING anything.

Either the strategy is too subtle to grasp or there's just nothing to it except random results.  It's not as bad as LCR but it just doesn't seem to excite.

**update**
Played with the right group (aka LOB) this game can be highly entertaining.  I'd get kicked out of Britain if I didnt update my original raiting of '5'

This game has absolutely no strategy to it at all that I can see. But boy is it fun! I have played this with as little as 2 players and as many as 7. And although the game plays out slightly different with different amounts of players, the end result is a fun, fun game. I think any more that 7 would get almost too chaotic. Good game for non gamers also.

My copy was bundled in a tin with [GAMEID=1446] and bought for 75% off at the annual (?) Barnes & Noble sale. The cardstock is pretty low-quality, but I got both games for $2.50, so it's not much of an issue, especially since it was subsequently stolen after I'd played it just once.

RATING: 4
I had read so many good things about Category 5 that when I saw this I decided to give it a try.  It was a dud.  There are a lot of simultaneous bidding games that are just more interesting than this one.  Maybe I'll try it with 8 to 10 players sometime to see if it works with a really large number of players.

I had it up for trade, but now I've played Category 5 and Take 6 with some gamers and my opinion of the game has changed a bit.  I'm thinking I might hold onto this game and try again with a large group.

Man... this game requires the right group.  The wrong group makes it a complete flop!  And, the right group makes it an okay filler.  All in all, I'm not impressed but it is fun with a group that gets into it.

After further review, it is okay with the right group and really bad with the wrong one.  The Slide 5 cards are poorly done as the 6's and 9's can be confusing to differentiate.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Pretty much identical to the game 6 Nimmt!, but you play a fixed number of rounds (5 to be exact) instead of playing until someone is the biggest loser with 66 points.  

Very accessible game.  Doesn't offer a lot for strategy, but it works well with non-gamers.  Too chaotic for my tastes.  Check out Hornochsen or Tanz der Hornochsen for more strategic versions of this game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Quick filler type game with a chance to guestimate what cards other players are likely to have, but also a fair dose of luck. Notwithstanding the luck element, although part of the luck is that another player might do something you didn't predict.

This one has a loosely nailed on skiers and avalanche theme, which is forgotten as soon as you're explained the rules.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is definitely more "fun" of a game than "strategic" of a game.  You can definitely make plays that are more safe than others, but it still feels like a crap shoot in the end.  And it appears that the number of people playing really sways the "feel" of the game (which isn't a bad thing... just interesting to note.)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Decent game still - works with a large crowd.  I don't like playing 5 rounds when some people had scored way too much, it started to take a bit too long.

Major error in font choice on the cards:  6s and 9s are identical so you have to be careful when looking at the cards.

I enjoy this little filler (and its basically identical cousins 6 Nimmt and Category 5.)  Tried the tactical variant for the first time, and found it TOO controlled.  I prefer the wide-open chaos of the "regular" version -- but not the "profi" version, which just gives me a headache.  This is one of those games I want to play as a light, social game; not a serious, card-counting game.

Slide 5 should really rate the same as 6 Nimmt, but the cards here are rather poor quality and the graphic design is rather busy and sometimes confusing between the 6's and 9's, so I'd rather be playing with a 6 Nimmt deck.

Fun mechanic. A bit dry, but with the right group can elicit many groans and much chest-beating triumph. Also allows for some screwage, though it takes a while to figure out how to achieve that and much depends on luck. This is one of those games that rewards inspired guessing about what your opponents will (and can, depending on what's in their hands) do--whereupon you try to ensure that their move will cause them to take a bunch of points (like Hearts, the scoring is "reversed," with fewer points being better). I love that guessing element in a game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Not at good at "Category 5" as it takes longer to play.  With "Slide 5" there are five hands played but with "Category 5" the game is played until someone breaks "74".  With "Take 6" (and other versions) the game goes until someone breaks "66".

Also the graphics SUCK!  It is easy to read the card wrong and after a time one's eyes start swimming.
It is worth the extra few dollars to pick up the other versions vs "Slide 5".

Good game, usually willing to play.  It is a fun diversion.  Very simple to learn and great for non-gamers.  Anyone serious about finding a winning strategy will be driven to madness.  Some hands seem so obvious what you need to do to get rid of your cards without picking up any pile.  The next hand, you seem to be picking them all up. Some I have played with find this frustrating.  You just can't put your finger on how to succeed every hand.  Oh, and the cards are really cheap feeling.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
(This is the exact same game as 6 Nimmt!, the game splits that are currently being allowed are insane)

The legendary Kramer filler...and, as filler goes, sub-mediocre. The game is a pile of blind action selection that almost has bidding like aspects because the card number also determines the order they will be resolved in. With the defined number set in the game (i.e.: 1-34 for a 3 man game) and a smaller number of hands on deck the randomness generated is actually decently controllable because it is fairly easy to track important cards. With more players or with the standard randomly generated deck the chaos is through the roof and it is almost impossible to play with any degree of foresight.

This is filler, and it is very, very light with few meaningful decisions in the sense that you can actually make an informed choice. Most damning to me is the fact that it's not compelling in the way that a Diamant, a Fairy Tale, a For Sale, or a High Society is and it takes a good 20-25 minutes to play, in which time it starts to wear out its welcome. Way too basic and random.

Slide 5 is a fast and fun game that has a small dash of strategy.  It becomes increasingly chaotic as the number of players increases, though with this game, that seems ok.

The rules are confusing as to what a "round" is.  Basically, you play out all ten cards in your hand, which constitues a round.  A game is 5 rounds, or however many you choose, and points are tallied cumulatively from each round.

Classic game similar to "Baker's Dozen / Poison" involving some bluffing that's all about playing your cards on the right hills at the right time, avoiding being the person to trigger an avalanche.  It can also help younger kids with their two-digit number recognition skills, giving them plenty of opportunity to learn that 59 is greater than 40 but less than 60, for example..

Yes, this is a fun game that is mostly luck of the draw. We had fun playing it, but I think many gamers will be put off by the level of luck involved. That being said, you basically have to play the hand you're dealt, just as in most card games. I will say that the group was very lively and talkative as we played this one and had a good time. I think that was a combination of not having to ponder overly much about strategy and of simply having a good time. I'd certainly play it again. It's a good game for larger groups, as up to 10 can play. I would rate it higher, but, as I said, I believe some will not enjoy a game that involves the luck of the draw to such a high degree.

Nice light filler that accommodates a large number of players.  Low numbers seem good until you start playing; turns out they are actually pretty evil.  As with any simultaneous action game, unexpected things will happen; that is kind of the point of the game. More fun with more people. Rules are poor.(3 plays)

First played October 29th, 2007. Taught in <5min, played in ~45min w/ 5 players. This card game has more strategy than first appears making it a decent luck/strategy ratio. Deck consist of 105 cards 1-105. Most cards have one skier on them, however there are others with more skiers on them. Cards divisible by: 5 has 2 skiers, 10 has 3 skiers, 11 has 5 skiers, and 55 has 7 skiers. Each player gets an initial hand of 10 cards and one card is placed face-up for each player in the game. Each of these face-up cards represents a "hill" and can support 5 cards, with the 6th causing an "Avalanche" and the player placing the card takes all of those cards and his new card starts then new hill. Each player selects a card hidden and turn face-up after all have selected. The lowest card gets placed first and must be placed on the card that is the closest lower numbered card. The next highest card is played until all have played. After all cards are placed, each select another card until you have played all cards ending the round. Score the number of skiers on each card taken and a new round begins. A round is played for each player. Lowest score wins. I recommend this if you know someone who has it, however I wouldn%u2019t bother with purchase.

One of the more enjoyable family card games I've tried.  With more than a handful of players it's too chaotic for any serious strategy, but it's still a lot of fun.  With four it's possible to play more competitively but it's still simple enough not to be intimidating for non-gamers.

I purchased a copy of this game for the office as my copy of Category 5 was very popular at lunch.  The game itself is the same (we played by the Category 5 rules) so my official rating the same (7), BUT I would dock the overall rating of this version because of the badly written rules and poor cards.  The color scheme and number style is bad, and the card quality is worse - the cards are not coated at all and are flimsy.

RATING: 3
Horrible. Why is this so highly rated? The decisions are obvious (90% of the time your best bet is to play the lowest card in your hand). The options are highly limited (often there is only one or two rows available for placement). And luck plays a huge role. The reviews for this (or really 6 Nimmt) sounded so good... what a dissapointment.

Initial Rating: 8.0 (October 2010)

Very good game, (in theory) it plays equally fast if you have 2 or 10 players as the game is simultaneous. You can explain it very quickly, but the game has a surprising depth, also it is very fun to play. I don’t know anyone who hasn’t liked this game. I prefer to play it with 5 or 6 players, with more I feel the game has more luck than I want to but either way the game is FUN.

On the negative side, it has paper thin theme, also the theme sucks (for me). The card quality is very low, I had to sleeve them ASAP. The game art also leaves much to be desired. 

Bottom line, a good game that I always bring to my gaming sessions, as it can accommodate a large number of players it sees a lot of play.

Own both 6 Nimmt and Slide 5.  Thought Slide 5 would be a cooler "theme", but there really isn't much "ski" stuff on the cards -- just skiers instead of bullheads at the top and bottom.  Still have issues with folks with the typical "6" and "9" confusion.  Given that this is the 3rd reprint, you'd think they would have gotten it right this time.  

Comes out with big groups (8+).

I've enjoyed playing this and it has been a success with some students I've taught it to.  I enjoy playing it but I'm still haven't decided if the gameplay is totally random or not.  I'm sure you have a little control over your destiny, but it feels so chaotic.  I always like the simultaneous action selection though.  Having played with 10 players (the max), I think I prefer it with 4 or 5.

Comment copied from the Category 5 entry, since it's the same game:

Another of these elegant German card games, specifically simultaneous card selection reminiscent of Turn the Tide. If it has a problem I think it's the part where a player playing a low card selects a row to take, with all other cards visible. This open calculation - and potentially choosing a player to target - seems at odds with the rest of the game.

So, I REALLY like category 5.  Light, nice fun filler.  The production of this version is so bad it is actually less enjoyable.  The numbers are very difficult to read, and the cardstock is flimsy.  The game is still mechanically fun, but this version is just sad. =(
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A crazy card game where you play numbers, hoping to add to four rows ascending without being the one that adds a sixth card to any row; if you add the sixth card, you have to take all cards in that row and add the points on each card to your score.  You start with a hand of 10 and everyone plays a card simultaneously.  After hands are exhausted, the player with the lowest score wins.  You can also keep score and play to a certain amount which will then trigger the endgame.  Very easy to teach/learn.  A nice filler game.

[Re-themed "6 Nimmt!"; my comment is the same.]
With 2-4 players it is an interesting game of decisions.

Simple rules and no dead time (everyone chooses the card to play at the same time).
Fast paced. Quick.

It's the same exact game as 6 Nimmt! just re-themed.  Great filler.  You need to understand the odds and try to keep track of what cards may still be available (many cards are left out intentionally).  Every once in awhile you're going to get the bone and when this happens just suck it up and try to learn by my your mistake.  The only real issue I have is it can be very tough to catch the leader since you mostly have control over your own cards.

Great game with the right boisterous group.  One of the nice things about this set of similar games is the wealth of variants and variations to try - 6 Nimmt! and Category 5 both have some and Slide 5 has some new ones as well.

The same eight players tried a couple of games of Slide 5 before Panic on Wall Street!. I played it later with four, but enjoyed it far more with a larger group as it really makes predicating things more difficult, but so much more satisfying when you do. The theme is pretty much pasted on, and I’m not sure a game like this even needs the pretence of a theme (No Thanks! doesn’t and is a fine filler game).

That aside, this fun filler is well worth considering especially if you have a large group of players to accommodate (it takes up to ten), for smaller groups I’d probably choose something different but with a crowd this is surprisingly fun.

If you have a choice between this and the other versions, pay the extra money for the other version.  Aside from the inferior card stock, the graphics on the card make the numbers confusing (the 6 and the 9's are guilty of looking identical).

RATING: 7
A simple yet fun game. The rule set is blessedly short - players will learn the game in about 5 minutes - but there is still enough depth to make it a rather satisfying experience. Sure, there is some luck - the card drafting is obviously randomized as well as the simultaneous selection of cards makes you unable to plan too well - but other than that there is just enough tactical decisions - [i]"Do I attempt to play on 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th row? Do I play on a row hoping another player with cause an avalanche before I do? Do I purposely force an avalanche to take only a few number of points now so I don't suffer later?"[/i] - to make you feel like you have control over your situation. Also, the fact that it's playable with such a wide range of number of players - 2 to 10 - is outstanding! Given it's cheap price, ease of play, depth, and player accommodation, I think it's an essential purchase despite being moderately reliant on luck.

I like this filler. I know that there's a bunch of luck involved and often, you get stuck with some lousy cards, but it's fun to watch it play out. Certainly nothing for an extended session, but a great way to pass a little time.

A very light blind-bidding type game.  Don't play with more than 4 or all Hell will break loose.  You don't have much control in this game, but that's okay because it's a filler, not a main event.  I'd play if asked, but I'm in no hurry.

5-10 players, Fast Play time, Easy Rules, Fun time. I always get the feeling of "IMPENDING DOOM" when playing this. My copy is wearing out fast, and I'm considering making a custom deck.

Rules used:
Number of cards to use is (Players*10)+4. This means every card will be in the game. Downplays the luck and ups the strategy a bit.

Um, what? This is a chaotic luckfest, and it puzzles me that this has even any strategy gamer cred whatsoever. I suppose it helps that it's designed by Kramer, but there's very little strategy to this, or at least the decisions seem to be rather obvious. This feels like it has a lot more in common with light trick-taking games like [gameid=6887] than it does with anything that's worth attention.  The strategies are generally pretty easy, and can be picked up within the first game, then the rest of the games are all simple extended resolutions of who gets lucky. Maybe there's some kind of advanced strategies, but I'd have to see somebody demonstrate an ability to win reliably before I'd think so.

(Aug 09 - after 1 6p game)   This one had us laughing many times throughout.  It is light and it is random/luck based.   You can read the players and board -BUT only so much.  This game is great to close out a night of game playing when you need a 30-45 min filler for a large group.  I can also see this as good for "non-gamers" and will be given as gifts this year..

[Comment and rating taken from those for 6 Nimmt!]

There are some games that I hate because of the chaos, and then there are other games that I love because of the chaos.  This game falls into the latter category.  I don't think this game is meant to be played strategically, or seriously (though there are certainly tactics that will help you win), but even if you do play that way, I think you'll enjoy the game.  If not for Geschenkt, this would probably hit the table a lot more.

Fun game. I usually play with only my daughter, but I rated it for more people, where it is better. It's really neat how the card play is done by very strict rules, but it the player's card selections makes it become chaotic and difficult to predict!

Great as a tool for teaching about double digit numbers to young children! My daughter didn't understand how they worked at all, but after playing this game a few times, she understood them perfectly.

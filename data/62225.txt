I've enjoyed this game a lot so far. Lots of action and interesting tactical choices with a varied set of battles. Great fun. Setup is a pain and could easily been improved by more visual setup instructions and an overview of what battle(s) the various unit counters belong to. I don't care much for the rulebook and think it makes what is a quite simple game harder to learn than need be.

Works well solo. 

Ascalon solo was an easy Crusader victory. 

Antioch solo turned out a very close, exciting result. A very narrow win by the Turks. 

Harran solo was a reasonably close Crusader win helped by a large Turk roll on the victory check. 

Aborted 2-player Ascalon, still close. 

2-player Antioch was a complete blow-out with an easy Crusader victory. Muslim player (me) just struggled to activate his units.

This game introduces three important new elements in the series: bigger maps and larger scale of the game, overall commanders, and the possibility of moving the standards on the map. The core rules are the same as Men Of Iron. The Overall Commanders do not influence the game that much and thus do not introduce a great novelty i the game. What is new, is the scale of the game. The maps are now very similar to those of GBoH. The game suffers from an unbalanced design all in favor of the crusaders: their cavalry is devastating and the free facing allowed before  counter-charging makes it very very very difficult to eliminate knights. 
However, the challenge is in learning how to make the most of the special ability of mounted archers and light cavalry which have little fighting power but more tactical flexibility. It takes a while to appreciate the complexity of this game which is, overall, not difficult to master in its general lines.

My first play was the Montisgard scenario (played both sides in quick succession) and it seemed very scripted with very few meaningful decisions for the players. On that basis, I wouldn't want to play this again, even though the theme draws me, but I'd be willing to have another go with another scenario and hope it might win me round.

Decepcionante wargame sobre las cruzadas.
Sin haber jugado a Men of Iron, el sistema de juego de Infidel me ha parecido bastante flojo. El método para las activaciones no me convence en absoluto dado que da lugar a situaciones absurdas donde gran parte de los ejércitos no se mueven turno tras turno mientras ciertos grupos se activan una y otra vez.
Los cruzados son prácticamente invencibles, mientras que sus rivales son masacrados inexorablemente uno tras otro.
No dudo que los escenarios son realistas, pero el jugador que recibe los palos no se divierte en absoluto... 
Para mi eso es un handicap enorme.

Un jeu un cran au dessus de son prédecesseur Men of Iron grâce à des batailles moins linéaires dans leur déroulement.
Par contre on retrouve la difficulté à maîtriser les interactions entre les différents types de troupes, et c'est encore plus flagrant dans cet opus : cavalerie légère musulmane et chevaliers. Chaque arme ne peut l'emporter seule. Il faut passer un peu de temps à comprendre ces subtilités pour que le jeu donne toute sa saveur. Nécessite donc d'avoir des joueurs d'un niveau équivalent pour ne pas avoir des parties à sens unique...Un bon jeu dans l'ensemble néanmoins.

Initial impressions were not that good, but may have been the result of exposing weaknesses in the system when there's too much cavalry involved. When you combine high movement rates with an activation system and units that can't react in an i-go-you-go system, things can get silly very fast. I suspect the game would do better in infantry heavy battles where cavalry is purely auxiliary. But, in a module that heavily features cavalry, that kind of kills any hope for the game.

The system itself, which was originally designed to be a simpler GBoH, has ballooned from a 12-page rulebook to a 16-page legalise monstrosity that is probably [i]more[/i] complicated than GBoH once you factor in the cavalry charge and counter-charge rules. If there was any doubt in your mind that Berg sucks at writing rules and designing elegant systems that don't rely on chromy bits to fill mechanical failings, this should cement it.

On top of that, I think the system itself has problems, with a rally system that is too easy and a movement system that is too simplistic and susceptible to abuse. Thumbs down.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
A nice simple system with more depth and 'sim' credibility than C&C but not so much that it is difficult to get to the table. 

The activation system is clever and poses the players some agonising decisions and the combat rules capture the flavour of the period - cavalry may be a little bit too manoeuvrable and responsive. 

It loses a mark for the single dice combat resolution throw, but I'm tinkering with using 2 D6 numbered 0-5 and 0-4 respectively to make the extreme results a little less frequent.

I would also like to have seen a few more scenarios in the box - historical knowledge of the battlefields is fairly scant so the designers tend to leave the map largely blank to the extent that I wonder if one completely blank map with a few terrain overlays would not have been better and more flexible in terms of providing future scenarios via C3i. 

I would like to see a Middle Earth/Fantasy battle version using this system.

Even though the narrative was easy to build with Crusader knights smashing into the flanks of Turk mounted archers and dealing mayhem and destruction, there are just so many minor details and exceptions to the exceptions to the caveats that it's difficult to enjoy the game. Granted, this would get better with experience, but this seems far in excess of what I consider normal "exceptionalism". It's unfortunate that it detracts from full enjoyment of the game. I still have hopes for it though, and can see the fun of the game even through the excessive rules caveats.

RATING: 6
The Men of Iron system is guilty of being dynamic and totally bogus.  Basically, despite the hundreds of die-rolls per game, the key rolls are all about command, either keeping it (via continuation), or taking it.  If these rolls go against you or for you, you with occasionally win or lose not because of skills or abilities, but rather just because of luck.  However, that's not the greatest problem.

The greatest problem with the system is that down-time is hopelessly down.  There is no use planning your move because you may not get the next move.  So, your moves cannot be pre-planned which means downtime is worse than it might otherwise be.

The actual clash of arms...one unit against another, is excellent, easy to calculate, and fun to resolve, but loss of initiative can cause whole flanks to become extremely porus without there being any effect to the unit.  Not enough redemption for fun.

Infidel is my favorite game of the series so far as there are lots of fast cavalry movements and slashing and counter-slashing.  Things get bogus when cavalry cut holes through a line and then the remnants of that line turn and attack the cavalry, but it's still a fun enough game to see Knights attacking. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
With small formations and battles with a miniumum of missile and cavalry units, Men of Iron somewhat works.

Infidel, however, has very large formations of cavalry and mounted archers and the simple system falls apart with tons of gamey things happening - massive formations rallying in a single action, a half-dozen units firing at a single unit trying to get a lucky hit, and units charging in a circle around their opponent to hit them in the rear.

Very approachable system that carefully models the warfare from this era. Lots of cavalry makes for very quick moving battles that look dramatic and, you know, battle-like. The horse archers are by far my favorite units, but the knights can put together a really powerful line-breaking punch too.

RATING: 10
Infidel is the second volume in the Men of Iron series. It still uses the Men of Iron system with some rule expansions to reflect the nature of warfare during the Crusades, but the clarity of the rules has improved significantly. Certain sections have been reworded and more examples are included. However, be sure to download the most recent version of the rules and the FAQ from the GMT website. 
Cavalry plays a much bigger role, resulting in a much more fluid game. Infidel introduces mounted archers. These units can move (even through an enemy zone of control), fire, and continue moving, as long as it has enough movement points, simulating the hit and run tactics of the Saracens. Mounted archers can reaction fire in both frontal hexes (effectively firing twice when both frontal hexes are occupied). The light mounted archers cannot shock attack, but they can retreat before combat against any unit. Medium mounted saracen units cannot retreat before combat against mounted units, but they can fire and shock attack in the same activation! On the Crusader side the mounted men at arms have been upgraded to knights. When knights charge, they become medieval tanks, crushing all who stand in their way. Knights never need to be in command to charge, treat Retire results as retreats, and never roll for charge reluctance. In fact, knights must counter charge when attacked unless they are in command and succeed in a resistance roll. Suffice it to say, if you were frustrated by the lack of opportunities to charge in Men of Iron, you should be very pleased with Infidel. Some who are new to Infidel might think that knights are too powerful, but play balance can be achieved once the Saracen player learns how to take full advantage of the mounted archers. Encircle the knights. Block their retreat paths with zones of control. Fire on their flank and rear and cut off retreat. If you liked Men of Iron, you'll love Infidel.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
The most dynamic of the Men-of-Iron series with the focus on the tactics of the Crusaders and Middle Eastern armies. Most battles are fought on wide-open terrain with a large quantity of cavalry. This opens up a lot of tactical decisions but with it added complexity due to the higher percentage of battles that use the charge/counter-charge rules.

Infidel plays very differently than the other entries, and is a great volume in a very good series.

I played it only solo, and it works wonderfully!
Rules are not so complicated: the game is suitable for unexperienced wargamers (like me...) too.
The maps are good, but the armies move often in a clear terrain: by my experience, there is not a great "terrain strategy" to do. But I think that this reflect the period warfare.
All scenarios are very different and show always a new and particular situation: so every one is interesting. And the continity/seizure system assure a new game experience at any time.
And it's really amazing to pass from the crusader side to the "infidel" one, each one with his specific warfare!
Want to play!!

While the games are fast and furious, there's something not quite right with the system as a whole.  Entire commands sit around doing nothing for several turns and you're left with the sense that more could have been included.  It's the kind of game that you throw out on the table every once in awhile when you need something that sets up and plays fast, but it's not something that you could play week in and week out.

We did the toughest battle first, Harran,and the Crusaders were destroyed.  Have to discover how to stem the rain of missles...

Next play was a solo Montgisard.  What a wipeout for the Crusaders.  Al-Afdal and Al-Adil were both killed in the action, and not a crusader was lost.  Mind the missing '47' mark on the flight point chart!

August ;17:  Played this one again...and these two died again!  Another complete crusader wipeout with no losses.

Ascalon was quite a messy one: units everywhere.  The Crusaders carried the day.

After playing Dorylayeum, I have decided that this type of battle, relying on the peppering with arrows and hit-and-run tactics of the Selyuks is not really to my liking.  There is an awful lot of moving and few actual hits.  This battle went eight or nine turns, and took a long time, mainly because I was a bit aggressive attacking the knights for little effect, and kept avoiding encounters by skipping backwards, the crusaders rarely able to follow up a disrupted retreating counter before they re-organized.  A lot of maneuver, but in the end somewhat static lines as the sides slowly attrit each other.  I prefer the more straightfoward toe-to-toe fights of Men of Iron and Blood and Roses.  Still, have about one more battle in the box to try and more than willing to play if someone has a hankering for eating some sand.

Update 2: the Ascalon scenario as written works and is great fun, provided the Fatimids get some decent rolls. Upping my rating, but some of the things the rules don't address continue to rankle.

Update: The Antioch scenario was disappointing and needs some developer love: the Turks have a tough row to hoe. Since we have been playing the more recent battles with the muldoon house rules, I'd forgotten how easy it is to turn flanks and how easy it is for archers to fire on the run. We'll try another scenario next time, but the rating could actually go down.

MoI was good, but this looks even better.  Hopefully the scenarios are more balanced.

I love the counters, but they're small. Thankfully there's no stacking, but there is facing. The rules are about 90% simple but there's some trickery related to counter-charges and special situations.

I also love the scenarios and the variety of units. It's fascinating to approach each new battle. But I found the battles didn't always play through quite so well. It's a nice combat system, but the outcomes are too often determined early on. Not a lot of tension. And there's perhaps too much dependence on lucky continuation rolls.

Definitive hex&counter tactical wargame of the Crusades era. Enough complexity for hardcore wargamers but still very fluid to play and streamlined enough for opposed play.

[thing=62225][/thing] is a medium to light wargame that uses the system [b]Men of Iron[/b]. I won't say much about the mechanics, since I only played one scenario - the Battle of Montgisard, thus many of the rules wasn't used (like terrains, a number of units, and so on). But the basics are:

- in your turn you can activate one leader, and that leader can activate the units of his type up to a number of hex away from the position of the leader;

- the units then can: became ordered (if they are disordered), recover (if they are retired), move and/or attack;

- after the type of units under the command of the activated leader, you can try to actived another leader on your side, rolling a d10 - you will have to roll equal or less the level of command of the said leader. If you success in this, the next leader you try to activated will have -1 penalty, the next -2, and so on. Therefore it will became increasingly difficult to activated leaders. Your opponent can try to block these activations by rolling a d10 to try activate one of his own leaders, but if he fails, you will succeed automatically in the activation of your leader. Once you fail (or is blocked) in your activation of leaders, the turn passes to your opponent. The game goes like this until someone wins.

The combat uses charts (with modifiers) for almost everything, from charges, shocks, melee, missales, and other situations. It is really simple once you get the hang of it - and this doesn't take long, because usually the same modifiers and the same chart will be used for the same action of the same unit you just activated, therefore if I have +2 in my missale roll with me light cavalry against knights, it will probably be the same for all the attacks I made with this unit against the knights, so you just move the units and roll.

[thing=62225][/thing] plays fast, with little downtime between turns. It can be a really good starting point for wargamers-to-be - the scenarios take around 2 hours from start to finish, and they give a nice historical feeling, with some notes about what happened. I thoroughly enjoyed my play, and will be seeking more.

****

After a year+ without playing, I can't justify to myself the 7 rating, so I lowered to 6.

If your a GBoH player than this system will take some getting used to. Detail sacrificed for playability, but for someone who wants to sit down and get a game in a couple of hours, drink a brew, and chat with your opponent about other things besides the rules, this is a really fun game to play. Mind you I like GBoH, but getting a complete game in a short time and still getting that period feel is what I like most about this system.

A very clever game, with attractive artwork and good quality components. 

Everything works well mechanically but for me there were too many moving parts to make the first half of the game any fun.

It took an hour for the rules to be explained and at the start I felt rather baffled by the plethora of options. 

In a three player game as player one at the start of each round you are faced with choosing one of 15 dice, being three in each of five colors. The die chosen is placed on a matching color space of your player board, giving you three options of what to do with it. 

One of those options is to place a marker on one of the three slots beneath each of the 5 die locations, meaning that on subsequent turns when you place a die then up to three additional actions will be activated for you. So you have 30 options to choose from on your player board. It takes quite a while to look at them all, check the reference sheet for some of them and then consider the impact of choosing one over another. A lot of time is spent doing that.

We all forgot rules here and there, and more than once someone would spend some turns setting themselves up for a rewarding payoff move only to then have it pointed out that they had overlooked a rule and the tile they were aiming to acquire was not actually one they were entitled to take.

It took 3 hours to play our 3 player game excluding the hour of rules explanation and game setup.  There's not too much point in planning ahead a great deal, as during the turns you don't know which dice will remain for you to take. So I tended not to dwell on looking at the dice too much until my turn came round.

As we progressed into the game we got quicker on our turns as we'd started to learn the 30 action spaces on our player boards and the wealth of options on the large main board. So it got to be more fun as the time passed.


Rules we forgot at some point or another:

If the total pips on the dice you have chosen exceeds the base threshold of 13, you won't get the reward at the end of the round.

Workers placed into the assignment spaces are returned to the general supply except those placed to take the threshold adjustment which are instead returned to the player supply.

Men taken from a career path to be placed onto a diplomatic mission space must (a) take the tile from only the right hand space above the city and (b) the tile must be placed against the matching career space on the player board.

Women placed onto the marriage space of a city go onto the lowest available value space, rather than matching the number of florins you spent to place her there.

Looove the dice drafting mechanism! Love the tough decisions we have to make every step of the rounds and all of that will affect the outcome of your game... Super-interesting choices!

RATING: 5
1 play / 3 Players

LIKE: Fun mechanism drafting dice and figuring out how to add helper powers for a points-engine. Colorful, and relatively easy to explain. Interesting combos.
DISLIKE: Dry theme, difficult to get players excited. Game felt not properly play-tested, as it needed variants. DO NOT PLAY 7 ROUNDS. Even for 6 rounds the game seemed a bit long. Lots of iconography slowed the game down.

OVERALL: The game needed variants, just to enjoyably play. I don't know how I feel about that, other than they should have play-tested a bit better. It feels lately that WYG games seem to a bit rushed and could use some fine-tuning. Overall I feel Signorie to be too unrefined for what it is, but it comes close.

I've only gotten this to the table 3 times, but I really like it.  However, I'm the only one who really likes it of my friends.  It is going to be really hard to get it played.  To be fair, it is repetitive and long, but the mechanics are fun and I get a satisfying brain burn from it.

RATING: 9
A really great game. The player interaction happens through competition over the various available dice, and competition over the available tiles. Keeping track of what tiles which players need and what workers they have available to take them is a hefty task, even for somewhat experienced players. The game is still enjoyable without this level of awareness, first time players will have plenty to hold in their minds trying to figure out how to optimize a very interwoven and interconnected system of upgrades (via hiring helpers) and planning out how to best use the available dice (and praying no one takes that blue 5 [yeah right] ). 

Concerns about the game being one round too long are somewhat justified (though I think planning for this and finding points on that last turn is a part of the game). The static boards (apart from differences in family plan) might also lead to build orders. But its a damn fun game, for sure.

Pleasantly surprised by our three player Signiore game, I found the decisions in this game fun to consider.  Admittedly, on first play, I had a strong desire to analyze the "whole picture" of game options in front of me, leading to some surprising, though pleasant, brushes with AP.   I was fond of the upgrade fever in the this game (lots of upgrades!), reminding me somewhat of Goa, that old classic "upgrade fever" euro.   

The distinctive Signiore "three option decision," at least on the first play, felt interesting.  Should I take a good direct action, a costly meeple-spending action, or an upgrade? I also liked the dice drafting decisions:  which dice should I take...at this time?  Interesting.  Nicely done.

As for the male/female meeple issue, I expected to really dislike this feature, but surprisingly, upon playing the game, found it to be well implemented.  The general game design idea is fairly non-controversial:  the designer wanted to have two different types of meeples which could be used to score, and activate, selected actions, in different ways.  Many games do this, and it can be an interesting mechanic.

Admittedly, choosing to accomplish this design goal by designating certain maples "male," and certain other meeples "female," is playing with fire so to speak.  Raise your hand if you are offended...that sort of thing, and I appreciate that. 

However, here, at least half the "game uses," for designated male and female meeples (turning them in to take a special "meeple costing" actions) is randomized by a tile draw such that in no way was one meeple gender "better" than the other, at least in this half of the game.  

The other half of the meeple uses were somewhat traditional/sexist (though thematic).  I think it is suggested in the rules that in the middle part of the board the female meeples are paying dowries and earning VP's and tiles, while the male meeples are going on quests.  As I saw it, though, in the middle part of the board, both genders were getting married there, requiring money on the female side, and fame track movement on the male side.  (Additionally, I might have changed the "having kids" mechanic such that higher rolls produced female meeples, rather than the reverse.)

All in all, Signiore felt like a distinctive euro gem of sorts, different enough in its game feeling, that it likely merits at least one play by anyone who likes euros.  On first play, I give it a 7 of 10.

On second play, again a three player game, I think the game probably warrants an 8.

This is another great What's Your Game title. There are always tough decision to be made each turn and it always feels as if you could just do one action more... The dice drafting and changing tiles makes each play unique enough to warrant multiple plays. I love the theme and the mechanics support it quite well, but even if all the mechanics are quite well tied to the theme, I'm left wanting just a little bit more immersion to the theme. I would have liked to see more thematic flavour overall, in the different career paths, different cities and different houses etc. Now it just strikes to me as a well streamlined dryish euro, which is not bad, but there could've been much more potential to explore. The art is maybe one reason for that, as it is perhaps the most bland of all What's Your Game games. The components are otherwise fine, but the game board was badly warped and there is a definitive tear line across one of the folds. These little thematic shortcomings relegate this game from being excellent to being just very good. Still, very playable, great mechanics and lots of strategic fun.

Initial Impressions:
----------------------
I was pretty excited going into this one.  I like games that use dice as workers that have some meat to them, and the overall dice mechanism in this one is definitely interesting.  Not sure what the heck the designer was thinking by making this game 7 rounds (we played 6), which works, but the game seems very 1 dimensional, as you NEED to put large value "men" workers onto the map as close to 13 points as possible.  Wouldn't mind trying again, but overall this game disappointed, but I wouldn't mind trying again.

RATING: 8
I really enjoy this game! The dice drafting mechanic is full of tough decisions and the players are constantly trying to balance short term goals with long term. The money is very tight and this creates many tense decisions in the game. I really think this is a special heavy Euro.

With 2 players we found the alliance tiles could get stagnant. We play that one of the 3 cities will be emptied each round, and all players know which city this is. We just mark it with a spare white disc and rotate this clockwise each round.

A very nice, quick-playing dice/worker placement euro. Needs a couple plays to intuit the synergies in all the different action selections. End game bonus achievement has a bit of luck tied to it, but still, you're generating 90% or more of your points in-game. Absolutely an AP machine.

One of those games where every move you make in the game scores you some tiny amount of points, and there are a billion different choices of actions available to do so. Pick a couple goals you want to head toward, and select actions to best get you to those goals.

Overall, I liked the game alright, as I kind of enjoy these "spreadsheets in a box" where you try to find some sort of engine to sync up.

However, I'll likely rarely play it. I've been finding more and more that I rarely head back to these games where there are a bunch of unintuitive things to learn (in this game, you have to know what a ton of different actions are and how they interact). The game is pretty good once you put it all together, but unless you play it again soon after, you'll have forgotten how to play, and you'll be back to learning from scratch again. I much prefer games where the ruleset is more intuitive, which helps the rules to stick in my head better for future plays.

Really great game. Love the dice drafting and it creates a really interesting dynamic between having to pay extra money for low dice and wanting to stay low to get the round bonuses. I'm a big fan of variable setups so I enjoyed the shuffling of the sons/daughters actions as well as the random sigils coming out on each cities. The game is simple enough to understand and play but I definitely need a few more plays to optimize my strategy, especially how to best add the extra actions on he player board. A lot of people complain that the game runs too long but I thought each round was short enough (without AP-prone players) that I didn't mind the overall length.

Dull game that plays by the standard engine-building playbook. Spend first half of game building engine (getting additional actions) unleash engine in back half of game. It is obvious that extra books and money actions are required in the first moves of the game. I felt like I was following a script playing. No interaction to speak of (race for initiative and spots, and taking dice only). No decision tension in this one at all as points come from everywhere. Meh.

I guess I really like dice games, because many of my high-rated games use dice in some capacity or another.

This one blends dice with actions and bonus actions and points accumulation.  It is also visually pleasing to look at, although some may think the artwork on the cover is hard on the eyes (I am looking at you, small little baby person).

I like the fixed ending, and the fact that you can manipulate your actions to gain or forgo the "bonuses" at the end of each round without letting it set you too far back from your opponents.

Book track is strong but the tiles selection strategy should also be heavily involved.  The yellow track with workers on the book track seems to be a very good strategy to achieve high score.
Gray tack with +$3 is also important to gain money in order to provide more flexibility to select low value dice.
Hope to try the following variant:
Next game we intend trying out the following simple variant: during the set up phase return all "unselected" alliance tiles to the bag*, then restock all locations from the bag.

Solid Euro game with an interesting dice selecting mecanic.  Yep, dice in a Euro... and it's fantastic.  Game rewards tight management and long term planning as well as quick opportunities and adaptation to changing environment.

I do prefer the game with the exhaustion of the assignment action variant, even though it is a really small change, it makes for another layer of decision and makes the experience plain better.

A wonderful game, I suggest it to any Euro fan.

I liked this game but Rhonda and Gregory were not big fans.  Possibly due to the long first play, but their stated complaint was too much unnecessary complexity.  Personally I really enjoyed the thematic consistency and need to manage family members (number, gender, training) as well as taking advantage of missions to other cities to pick up influence with desired families.  I hope I can convince them to try this game again soon.

RATING: 7
A clever dice drafting game with an interesting cornucopia of point salad mechanisms that are surprisingly thematic. I enjoyed the drafting mechanism as well as the action tethering one, however several other mechanisms left me a bit cold. There's bonus chits everywhere, too many actions to choose from, and several currencies involved. But the major flaw of the game that hits hard towards the end is simply that the game runs too long and overshoots its natural development arc. With 4 players, play 5 rounds only, not 6 (according to the official variant) and God forbid not 7 (according to the rules)! The components are top notch and the board and iconography is for the most part clear and pleasant, like all WYG productions.

This could have been a great hit. As is, it is flawed, but nevertheless enjoyable and fun. Keep it away from AP-prone players..

First off, I was a bit surprised that the component design quality seemed to be a step down from previous WYG games. But that's not a huge deal. As expected, there's lots of interconnected stuff. And like Madeira, there are rolled dice for which impact everyone (to some extent). Unlike any previous WYG game, I had a really hard time connecting the systems in brain with any sort of thematic fabric. And that's even compared to Madeira, which some people find dry, but makes perfect sense thematically to me. Only one play so far, but I'm a bit concerned about there being an optimal build path, in terms of the white discs on your board (again, thematically I have no idea what that is). FWIW, turn order is insanely important. I'm open to being wrong, but the compensation for starting turn order doesn't seem to be enough. Or maybe players just need to be warned that turn order is critical. Oh, and the luck of the dice on rolling for offspring can be really annoying. I rolled nothing but males for the 1st 80% of the game, which is frustrating. Also, not for the AP prone, as especially toward the end there's a lot of min-maxing of options. Overall, I admire the design, but it grabs me less than other WYG games so far.

Euro con mecánica de draft de dados. Es el típico juego de los que me gustan! Me encantan los juegos que tienen tableros individuales para cada jugador! Buenos componentes, aunque todo son colores planos en tablero algo pobre y feo que no entra por la vista. 
Creo que este juego da una impresión inicial de ser muy complejo; no por la dificultad en entenderlo, que es fácil, sino por el cantidad de acciones y abanico de posibilidades que se te presentan en tu turno y que parece que te puede explotar la cabeza. Pero es sólo al principio de la primera partida. Con el paso de los turnos, todo es más sencillo de lo que parecía. Hay algo de Análisis Parálisis, pero puedes reducirlo pensado tu jugada entre turnos si ves que nadie puede quitarte ese dado que te interesa. Hay interacción, pero baja, y en mi caso, eso me gusta. 
Hay quejas sobre la duración de las partidas (no me extraña si hay mucho AP), y del más que posible estancamiento de losetas de Alianza y meeples en las ciudades, por lo que han tenido que sacar variantes oficiales (y no oficiales) para paliarlo. Las variantes de una ronda menos es obligatoria; las demás le quitan algo de chicha al juego.
La rejugabilidad no parece mucha ya que siempre querrás empezar las partidas de las misma forma que hayas probado que te funciona adaptándote un poco luego a las recompensas de fin de ronda.
A mí me ha gustado mucho! Y encima se monta y recoge en un periquiete! Sobresaliente!

Signorie is a great action selection game, using dice to determine the action. It has some wonderful Euro-style decision points in it, and some good ol’ fashioned engine building.

The rules as published are not ideal as they suggest 7 rounds when the game is clearly so much better with 6 rounds. If you are playing I advise you check out the 6 round variants. 

Even with 6 rounds it is over long: our first game ran to 4 hours. Whilst this will come down the game does have some major AP potential in it so playing time will always run long.

Overall it is too long for what it is and will probably head for the trade pile.

Von den WYG-Jahrgangsbrüdern NIPPON und SIGNORIE finde ich SIGNORIE geschmacklich den etwas hirnverschwurbelteren Arbeitsnachweis. Die typisch italienisch-portugiesische Handschrift dieser Art von Brettspiel ist auch in SIGNORIE die gleiche geblieben: ein abstraktes Mechanismen-Monstrum, indem Grübler in die Ewigkeit diffundieren können. 28 Würfel-Worker-Aktionen im gesamten Spiel bilden den Betonboden, auf dem man effizient Engine-Building betreiben möchte und früh in die Denkklemme von Prioritäten gerät. SIGNORIE ist für Freunde von WYG eine sichere Bank, für Verlags-Hasser eine selbsterfüllende Bestätigung, dass Gesellschaftsspiele "Catenaccio im Kopf" sein können und die Schwächen des Spiels ausmachen: Themenferne, fehlende Skalierung, nachgeschobene Regelnuancierung. Barfüssige Leichtigkeit werden die Leute von WYG nicht mehr erfinden. Die rein funktionsorientierte Art Direction von SIGNORIE findet nach dem zu kühl geratenen NIPPON wieder in den wärmeren Goldton von ZHANGUO zurück.

Clever dice placement game, evokes the theme well.  I particularly like how they have created the complexity in the game by the key dice-taking decision point - simultaneous pressures to pick high, pick low, get a key number before it is gone but do them in the most efficient order too.  May need a timer for the AP-prone!  The more you play the more you appreciate the depth and different strategies available.

Overall, a good game, and the dice drafting is interesting.  I would gladly play again, but I would not request it.  Because of the theme, I found myself wanting to play Village, which is more engaging and much more immersive, creating a bit more narrative about my family.

There are a lot of cool things going on in this game. Great choices. Do you upgrade your player board (and pay the cost to do so?) or take an immediate action that may give you a 5 point tile? Do you play for the end of round bonus, or do you just take all the high pip dice so that you can do every action cheaper? Which main action do you take? What if you have too many of one sex and not enough of another? With all this great stuff, there does seem to be a huge advantage to going first each round that can lead to a runaway leader problem and there was a bit of "fun factor" lacking for me. I want to play it more using one or more of the variants to see if that makes a difference as the tile layout can really affect what players can and cannot do, almost unfairly it seems.

Two plays, three players, six rounds. The design is formulaic, and it feels a bit abstract and overwhelming with all its different moving parts, but having said that it does all work well and it kept me interested and engaged. 

Having a helper strategy going into it will probably make a big difference in one's score, so in that respect the game is going to be a bit more fun for a veteran than it is for a newbie.

While I liked the use of the dice the rest of the gameplay felt rather dry and mathy.
 In the end of our three player game all players got over 100 victory points only 3 VP apart of each other.  So a lucky dice roll decides if you won over or lose .

Wymagające euro, z gatunku raczej cięższych. Kierunków rozwoju i możliwych strategii jest naprawdę od groma, co z początku zdecydowanie przytłacza. Dość świeża mechanika, całkiem nieźle współgra z tematem. Zauważalna interakcja, głównie na zasadzie "kto pierwszy". Szczypta losowości wprowadza taktyczny element dopasowania się do sytuacji. Jedyne zastrzeżenie to podatność na paraliż decyzyjny, co prowadzi do sporego downtime'u. Wykonanie solidne, choć bez żadnych fajerwerków.

Amazing!!

It sounds incredibly complicated during the explanation. It's not, it's only quite complicated.

The mechanics are brilliant and the game lasts exactly as long as it should with all the spaces only just filling up.

I think strategically it's probably best to split yourself across 3 of the end game points streams not four. If you split yourself across just the three men routes then it may be difficult to sustain the amount of men required AND will leave you with a ridiculous amount of surplus money.

I tried the above in my first game and came second with 24 coin left over. Had I taken 3 women and payed 8 each I would have got 48 points, plus a bonus 12 for 3 women on the board in different regions, plus a bonus for the tiles. I would have probably had to cut out going for one of the other three streams but it would undoubtably have won me the game. I learned for next time!!

Excellent game. The balance between saving money on actions and getting the end of round bonuses is really nice. And the decision of when to build up bonus actions versus when to actually do things is cool too. And finding the right combination of bonus actions will be important; there's some good potential for finding nice combos and customizing your family. The envelopes are really interesting, they're a good way to make use of the kids of the gender you're less interested in. And the theme is something we found pretty entertaining though I could see it being bothersome to others. When I was explaining it, it was dubbed Patriarchy: The Board Game. It is effective and evocative at getting you into the mindset of an Italian noble patriarch, and the way you have to use your family to make connections to become more powerful.

Also, it seems like the official six round variant, at least in the four player game, is a must. But seeing as it's an official variant I see no reason to knock the game too hard for having a seventh round where there's not much left to do.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (July 2016)

What’s your Game? is perhaps my favorite boardgame publisher. I have liked every one of their games (that I have played) and Signorie is no exception. Every game they publish is a ”must buy” for me.

The rules aren’t complex, but there are many rules so you can explain them under 20 minutes. Playtimes is around 2 hours. The art is ok.

The dice aren’t of the best quality, they look cheap. The gray dice are the worst because you cannot see the numbers clearly at a distance. In general, it feels that game components decreased in quality from previous What’s your Game?´s games.

The theme is ok as well, nothing really exciting, but there are some game mechanism that support it through the game. 

Signorie is a medium weight dice drafting game with lots of interesting decisions (which die to take having into account the color and the value, which helper to choose, how many actions play per turn, should I win a reward this turn?). I LOVE the tension when you are choosing the die, the value determines the discount of the action (and money is very tight) and the color determine the action itself, so at the same time you want to choose a high/low value die and you have to balance this situation to win. Also, you need to carefully read your opponent’s intentions to help you in the timing of when to pick the dice available. The decisions aren’t obvious in any way!

As with many What’s your Game?´s games, perhaps it is best played with 3 players, otherwise, the downtime can be excessive.

I particularly like the female and male meeples (I have only seen this before in Helvetia), you use them to do diffferent actions, but I somewhat dislike that it is luck that defines the sex of the meeple. In general the game has some luck but I feel it is controllable so it doesn’t bother me much. The player who plan the best will win most often than not, luck has a limited impact in the game other than deciding if you have a son or a daughter. 

Signorie definitively has a What’s your Game? feel. It is reminiscent of Madeira (because when you choose and play a die you are actually choosing 2 or more actions, that is, every decision is pretty deep and multifaceted) and Zhanguo (because both games have triggered bonus actions if you plan accordingly).

Bottom line, Signoire is a good Euro game and a keeper for me. It offers tension through the game and it is very deep (although not as heavy as Madeira). I need to try the variants soon, I still don’t know what they are because I wasn’t the one who read the rules.

Enjoyed my second play, but not quite as much. I wonder about the replay value here, and I really want to try it with 4 players.

For as long as the game is, I would probably always choose something else like Nippon or ZhanGuo. It is definitely a good game, but I prefer other games of a similar weight/length.

Engine building and action selection with some original scoring goals.  Selecting an action consists of taking a numbered die for that action type (based on color).  Generally, low dice are more expensive to use and high dice can be more powerful, but you get substantial benefits for only selecting dice that total 13 or less, creating some good (and frustrating!) tension in getting the dice you want before they're taken.

RATING: 5
[floatleft][ImageID=2684003][/floatleft]It pains me to rate this so poorly, but the game made me do it. I adore the use of dice in this game but the dry game play and horrific endgame left me with no desire to play again (at least not with the RAW, more on that later). Let's start with what I disliked and try to end on a positive note. The game is very dry, and is themed in an incredibly sexist time period. Men get to advance on career paths and women get married off to forge alliances with other lands. When not being commodified women get to be baby machines (which is actually a pretty interesting mechanism for getting meeples from the general stock). It's not that I can't look past the theme, or that I'm upset or incited by it, it's just that the theme is hard to engage with. I can't get excited about this theme at all, it doesn't help elevate the gameplay, it actually hinders it. This is the least of my worries though, I'm quite accustomed to dry themes, or ones that I must get past (I'm vegan so all those games steeped in causing unnecessary harm to non-human animals are not exactly filling me joyful encouragement).

The biggest issue I had with the game is the pacing and specifically the endgame. The final round was a stark landscape of marginal scoring opportunities. The board had filled up completely with diplomatic men and oppressed women. The goals I had initially set for myself were completed, all that was left was scrounging for a few pity points. I much prefer when games put the screws to you, for example like [thing=154809]Nippon[/thing] does. Signorie lets you get too much accomplished by the end of the game, and the result is an utter lack of tension in the final couple of rounds. 

[center][ImageID=2729335 medium][/center]

My final complaint is a bit involved and perhaps hard to understand if you haven't played. There are six different family crests with points ranging from 2-5. You have 4 different set collection goals, one for each of the men's career paths and one for marring off women. That is, you must collect specific crests for each of these paths. The crests in a path will only score if you have at least 3 collected for that path. There is no bonus for fully completing a path, which makes sense because if you had to complete it that would put too large of an emphasis on collecting the correct crests which would case the random method that these enter the game to overwhelm your options. Mitigation of luck here is taken a bit further as you can easily gain wild crests which score only 1 point but help towards the minimum of 3 needed to score them. Moving men into cities is a huge source of points, often between 7 and 13, you also may collect the crest if it corresponds to one you need for that path. However, since the crests are fairly easy to score anyway and the points they offer rather small compared to the points for moving the man in, it can make perfect sense to build an engine with a single career path to churn out men and take crests only opportunistically. The set collection is an afterthought and there is no tension in trying to complete sets. This all leads to a predominant strategy of cranking men out. It's not quite as simple as all of that, but it does feel very samey, especially since all three career paths are mechanically the same.

Finally I want to say that the action selection mechanism in this game is wonderful. Four dice (standard d6's) are rolled for each of 5 colours and on your turn you select a remaining die, place it on your board and choose one of 3 options which depends on the colour of die you took. The pip value of the die matters for two reasons, 1) if you take a low value you may have to pay precious coins to use it and 2) at the end of the round you gain a bonus if the total value of all dice you took is less than 14. This leads to agonizing and tense decisions and lots of player interaction. I would highly recommend anyone play the game once just to experience this aspect of the game. I just wish the stuff they built around it held up to the same standard of quality.

I would like to play this again and I think that if the first round of the game were skipped and the final two rounds combined (forcing players to choose one of two bonus scoring tiles on the last round) the game may have better pacing and a less anti-climatic endgame. I'm not big on making huge changes to games that should have been addressed in development, but I like the action selection so much I will probably try this out when I get the chance. It has been pointed out that one of the official variants chops the first round off the game, so that may be a sufficient change.

RATING: 7
The WYG title that flew under everyone's radar. A few critical voices in the forum kept me from seeking it out. Unjustified, as it turned out. While not groundbreaking, it's a solid game on par with other more popular titles. Though mechanically not as sound and replayable as e.g. Nippon, my personal enjoyment was a bit higher. 

Initially, the game requires building up the engine by improving the five action areas with permanent benefits. Choosing the benefits and finding the balance between continued engine building and using the main actions of each area is nontrivial. The strategic aspect is complemented by the tactical puzzle of choosing and attributing the action dice each round. 

With repeat plays, the luck of the crest tile distribution could prove to be annoying. Some of the tiles are stuck in the display, being of use to no one or a single player who can choose to keep them for the last round, reducing opponents' choices. The action tiles constitute another weak spot. Until the last rounds, they rarely will be chosen except for the one tile raising the allowed pip count. Except for this action, they are too expensive to be a strong choice. Having to use one of them is a notable efficiency disadvantage.

The tactical challenge of selecting the dice is the reason why I would probably choose Signorie instead of most other WYG titles notwithstanding its mechanical weaknesses.

Basic info:
1 play.
4 players.
7 rounds.

2 players and 3 rounds too long.

Personally, i would give this game a second chance, provided that i know the people in my gaming groups are not AP prone, AND with house rule variants! Firstly, it was WAY too long, sitting around doing the proverbial "staring into space (read, career path tracks in Signorie)" after the first 4/5 rounds was painful.

Continuing on with the trend of the negatives before talking positives, the players who had the gumption to place extra workers on the career paths track just literally walk away with the game from the second round, was also a mechanism that i did NOT like. This was hugely compounded by the seeming lack of playtesting that occurred for this game.

Perhaps i am being harsh, but i'd appreciate someone explaining to me why the objective of this game seems to be gain influence in the region to strengthen your claim to be the eminent family of the time and region! And yet, the corresponding VP from gaining alliances (through marriages or diplomatic actions), were 3/4/5. While sending a girl to get married with a hefty dowry could net you 8 VP. How does that make any sense? It gets worse, when you look at the VPs earned from sending the male meeples to "be trained", and subsequently sent out to earn a whopping 13 VP for being sent out. That one male meeple has now earned more than the sum total of the average 3 tile set (assuming you took NONE face-down.) You would be lucky if you were to get 3/4/5 as your 3 tiles, in which case you would earn a potential of 12 VP from successfully solving sufficient diplomatic missions of that type. (Why is it that the mechanism to earn VP from the diplomatic missions feels like, you've had to think about and plan your way around and strategise how and when to send out your people at varying levels... all good and positive things, and yet, you successfully complete your set and feel a sense of accomplishment from it, only to realise that your opponent sent out 2 people in that time, not caring about tiles and has twice your vp?

Which brings me to the most scathing part of this, why give so much bonus VP at the end, for people who are sitting around doing nothing at the end. The objectives are not accomplished, they have not assisted the house or family in any way, yet, they earn you a whopping 6 VP (assuming they are at the end of the track, and let's face it, playing 7 rounds, everyone is at the end of the track), Each character sitting there earns you more than the tiles you worked so hard to obtain?

The positives.
The dice mechanic. Feels like it requires planning and strategy to maximise each turn. However, was "easily gamed" by one at my table, who just took a 5/6 die on both of those that had extra workers for the track, every turn. Which ended up being equalling 6 turns of 10-12 points plus other actions... No prizes for guessing who won!
When trying to justify the mechanics that were part and parcel of the game, i put it down to this: In order to make the early game relevant (in terms of points scored) and being able to send your people out earlier (both male and female meeples), females in the early game, you send out with 1/2 coins dowry which converts to 2/4 VP, they give you 3/4/5 extra VPs, to then make it roughly equivalent to the end game meeples you're sending out at 8 VP (4 coins), without any tiles! Similarly for the male meeples, the 3/4/5 extra VPs, is there to make it so that the 1/2/3 VP you earn from sending out male meeples at lower levels is not completely irrelevant. However, that begs the question, is that, the best design? Would a more streamlined game with fewer points to earn not make the game run both faster and smoother? Without most players running into the problem of filled cities?

Lastly, a note about the turn order play at the end of the round. The rulebook seems to suggest that turn order is settled first, prior to the rest of the round order being concluded, as such, free actions at the end of the turn, are actually resolved with the NEW turn order. As such, specific actions that you get to take on turn 2, are resolved in the upcoming turn 3 order. :) Highly counter-intuitive that was!

Mechanically solid mish mash of a eurogame. Everything works together smoothly and you are building a small engine which starts producing points from here and there. Then it just keeps going on and on without much drama as even the competition for dice isn't too harsh. Towards the end you start to optimize more and more and the game starts to freeze accordingly.

This game has a lot of upsides: it has a cool and strong theme, the helper mechanism is great, so is the dice mechanism: both the drafting, and the "Rule of 13", where you balance your need for low numbers for a reward, and high numbers to pay as little as you can. That being said, the game breaks down for me in two places: one, the needless randomness of the family tiles, which adds nothing but swinginess to the game; and two, the fact that the game lasts a turn and a half too long, and that there are no moves left by the last turn.

I like this game.  I like the mechanism whereby players select from a common pool of dice to allocate and use the available power(s) all the while managing the total pips consumed in order to participate in end of round bonuses.  The various powers or actions available are plentiful and fun too.  Because the game can be long-ish and is somewhat complicated, I hesitate buying it only because I'm not sure how often I could get this played in my limited gaming opportunities.

Marrying off your women and schooling your men in different career tracks. This game is a solid euro, but I just wanted more out of it. The dice drafting mechanic with the reward is nice, and keeps you in check, but the point scoring mechanisms aren't as interesting as I'd hoped, and some don't seem nearly as good as others. Just get men, get them to the top in their field, and send them on a diplomatic mission for huge points. The game also has some weird aspects with the mission spots filling up and becoming inaccessible. I wanted the design on this to be a little bit tighter.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

I wasn't blown away and was hoping for something more. There are still interesting aspects to this dice game, particularly in the dice selection aspect where one aims to often have a sum of their dice = 13 or less so one can take a bonus action(s). DEFINITELY play only 6 rounds in the game - this should have been a standard rule as you are not likely to find much available space for diplomats or marriages in the 7th round...and often barely in the 6th round as this is where the majority of points are present. This is basically a 2/3 currency game where money, man meeples, and woman meeples are all valid forms of currency depending on the action selected. I also enjoyed the aspect of purchasing helpers that will enhance future actions.

I've been thinking about this game since I played it last night, and not necessarily in a good way. It's a perfectly fine game, perhaps a little too fussy, with some interesting ideas and decisions. But the theme just utterly kills it for me. 

Renaissance Italy, nobles, marrying off daughters, the whole thing is like a hamburger except the buns are white bread and the meat is also white bread. It's exactly the kind of "theme" I can no longer stir myself to care even a little bit about. Actually, it's worse, because the presentation of women in the game, while I guess historically accurate, isn't really something I think we need to make sure to render "realistically". It's worse than not caring, it's kind of off-putting.

"But surely you can get past that to look at the gameplay itself!" To some extent, sure, though while there are some neat things happening here, it's also got some of that current-trend bloat where if we can squeeze in one more thing let's squeeze in one more thing. 

I didn't hate it or anything, but it didn't do much to appeal to me.

The best of the What's Your Game games. It can be explained in 10 minutes and it's mildly fun. It doesn't overstay its welcome, but it's pretty random when it comes to the crests that come out.

The dice drafting has been so polished to avoid bad problems that it almost doesn't matter which dice you get. Still, better that than being infuriated by getting locked out of actions.

Good game,Nice puzzling certainly, but not a super score because: not enough interaction (do you watch the other player if he does everything right?), a dry point salad, so (too?) many choices... and did we count all the points correctly during the game? 
After playing more times... Very good with 2 and thx to the official variant good score for 4 players also

Played once (plus half a demo game). Action selection based on dice, plus some engine building in that you can attach bonus actions to each dice colour.
A bit of a point salad and the interaction is limited to taking stuff that others might want (but it's certainly felt). Still, I enjoy the engine-building aspect and the way high dice values are both good and bad. Good game, hope to play it more often to discover it further.

Cannot get enough of this game. The choices are great. Choose an action by grabbing a die , but you don't want to go over 13 with the value of dice or you don't get a bonus but like to pick higher dice so you don't have to pay money for it. The track for the male worker works very well which has a good push your luck feel to it. You want that shield and stay on the track as long as poss but could get beaten to it by an annoying opponent who won't let you win. Maybe I just love collecting different shields and that's why I love it so much . I need to get a life really !

Wow, this game is great. The use of dice and the helper mechanism is a very clever design. Sometimes i do not really know wich is the best option for my turn - i do enjoy this. I like to play Signorie as a two player game. Four player is too long in my opinion (i recommend the 6-round-variant). Warning: Do not play with AP prone players! Components and iconography are well done.

RATING: 7.5
Pros: 

+Fun color scheme with matching dice
+Decisions are interesting, if not grueling 
+Rule book is well-written
+Bonuses are fun and add an engine building feel to the game
+Theme makes historical sense

Cons: 

-A bit long (our first game took about 2 1/2 hours, and that was with the short game variant--rules explanation not included). 
-Some of the choices, despite being some great options, seem to be underpowered. So, there might be some balancing issues here. 

Overall: Another solid Euro by What's Your Game. I'm not sure that you'll love it after the first game. I think there are several layers to peel off in this one.

A lot of choices to make (and explain) but it really is one of the lightest What's your Game's euro offerings.  Each action is basically choose a dice, do one of three things with it.

Dry run: 4/18/16.  Game could use player aids to help with beginning and end of turn upkeep.  Rules: easy/medium.  Rule book is disjointed.  Not horribly so, but enough to make finding specific rules problematic.  Iconography helps.

Used short variant.  (Dropped round 7)
Used house ruled variant to clear one city every round.  Marker moves clockwise. 

Seemed to work well.  Short, but not ridiculously so.  Crest tiles seemed to move pretty well.

The action selection mechanic is quite interesting. Do I try to stay at 13 or under to get the round bonus or do I go high to avoid having to pay for my actions and to get my helpers to move my males up the tracks quickly?

Knowing which helpers to go for is unclear and as such there is a lot of space to explore different combinations. What concerns me is that the best helpers will be eventually determined and they will not change much from game to game because their relative usefulness doesn't seem to be dependent upon the random round/VP bonuses. I'm hoping to be wrong about this.

The balance between getting a lot of points for each male versus sending many into the towns to ensure getting the end game set collection bonuses is compelling. In the first game, I got the marriage set bonus, but for the males I had two sets of two, which cost me many points. For many of the men I scored the full 13 points, but maybe I should have sent a couple to the cities sooner to ensure getting the 10-12 points each for those two sets.

I don't much care for shuffling the envelope tiles each round. I think they should be randomized just once for the entire game.

We played one round fewer as suggested by many (this worked well), counting the final bonus tile as an endgame tile that scores for everyone. We also cleared the tiles in the cities each round.

This is a solid game overall, but I'd rather play Zhanguo by the same publisher, or for a dice based game Macao, Troyes, or Grand Austria Hotel.

Very well designed game. Choosing coloured dice. Particularly the helper-actions are useful. It is an investment in the future. To make future actions of that dice colour more powerful. There is much more to it, it is a very involved game. I want to play this game again.

RATING: 7.5
I love the idea of dice pool selection games, and this is a contender for my favorite.  The fact that all dice colors are always available keeps players from being blocked, but the possible cost involved and the bonus for staying under 14 adds a nice valuation balance.  The ability to upgrade actions with the helper discs is great, and allows for some tough decisions early in the game.  The process to get flag tokens through male/female meeples works well, but planning ahead for a longer strategy is tough since the flags come up randomly.  It's also not uncommon that the board will get clogged with unwanted flags.  Players have developed variants to address this, but nothing in the base rules really deals well with it.  Overall, it's full of good decisions, nice engine building, it rewards good planning of sequential events, and allows for different focuses to earn points.  It plays a bit long, especially with any AP due to the varied options, but players generally stay engaged.

A fun and interactive dice-drafting engine builder!

It's a lot of fun to improve your engine by getting new powers when activating certain areas, but you can spend the entire game doing so and you have to focus on the scoring before it ends as well.

Another dice drafting game but in this one all players will have access to a dice of every action, so that normal tension of having to go for a specific die before it's gone doesn't exist in this one...
the tension comes from the values on the die, they serve to discount the cost of the action associated with it, so you want some high dice, but at the end of the round there's a reward for the players that have the sum of all the dice they used be equal or lower than 13! So you can't just grab all the 6's 

That tension is different than normal and it's pretty cool...

the game offers plenty of choices in each dice pick and planning is very important in this one.

Some caveats, play with the official "one less round" variant, otherwise the game will be too long and a bit boring because that last round really isn't needed!

SOOO close to being really good. I REALLY wanted to like Signorie more than I did. It's just a bit too long and repetitive for what it is. There is a bit of an arc from beginning to end with what helpers you recruit and how much more expensive cities become to enter, but otherwise you're mostly doing the same thing you did on turn one at the end of the game. In many ways, this game reminds me of Trajan. Not necessarily mechanically, but in feel. There are a tremendous amount of avenues to go down to score points, even if some are more obvious than others. Unfortunately, it just didn't work that well for me.

Gran bel gioco, molto stretto e dalle regole lineari che però necessita di un paio di partite per poter essere padroneggiato con cognizione. Piazzamento lavoratori e gestione dadi sono alla base di Signorie, il gioco dura 7 turni (esiste la variante 6 turni) e ad ogni turno si possono fare fino a 4 azioni, per fare un'azione bisogna scegliere il dado corrispondente tra la dotazione comune ed eseguirne le funzioni. Forte interazione, pochi spazi e tattica a breve termine fanno di questo gioco un puzzle da risolvere. Promosso a pieni voti anche se solitamente la spiegazione abbastanza lunga fa storcere il naso.

Dice mechanic is great, but theme is weak. Can't engage with it. The boring art design doesn't help. Iconitis takes a while to understand. I won my first game and didn't even really know what I was doing, which is not satisfying at all. The massive amounts of pts to be won by sending your men on missions seems unbalancing. I read the game had not been playtested properly and that kept me from purchasing it. Played someone else's copy and once was enough. Played two hours but lost interest half way through. 

After two really positive experiences with heavy 'what's your game' games, zhanguo and madeira, this doesn't come close to competing with those two, either in strength of theme, artwork, consistent engagement, or gameplay.

Signorie was a very interesting dice drafting game in which drafting dice with low values costs money and may result in a less powerful action, and drafting dice with high values might push you over a threshold beyond which you don't get valuable rewards. The dice were also colored according to their action, but you could only do each action once each turn. You can also buy techs that give you bonus abilities with each action, which was neat. I really liked the core dice action mechanics, but found the end game to be pretty wonky--players got to the point where many things were already maximized, making many actions useless. It's almost as if the game should've been at least one entire round shorter.

This one feels totally like a WYG?-game, by whom I mean that after reading the rules, you have a general feeling of 'how-the-hell-do-you-have-to-play-this-if-I-wanna-win?' :-)

It's a very abstract game, with totally pasted theme and apart from the box art, I'm not that keen on the art inside the box. 

But the main question is off course: is this a good game, and answer is for sure 'yes'. You wanna do X-moves, but can only do X-2 and in this game is the order in which you chose your dice and perform your actions of extreme high importance.

You can't do everything but you also can not let someone run away with a path either. We let that happen in our game. No one was stopping another player from getting all the high value point tiles and there was nothing we could do by the end to stop him from winning. I will do a lot differently next game. Takes a few plays, I guess. 

Interesting and different. I look forward to playing again soon!

On a player's turn they draft a die, then place the die into the matching slot on their player board, and resolve on of the three actions associated with that color. The higher the value on the die, the cheaper that action is, however, if the sum total on all your dice is too high, you'll miss out on the cool event at the end of the round. One of the most fascinating things about the game, is one of the action options for each color is to add an additional effect to a different color of action, which allows you to build a real engine.

Although I enjoyed this game a lot in plays 1 and 2, I think 3 plays is as much as I'm going to get out of this game. A lot of the game is about when you get those kicker actions unlocked and where. The problem here is that not all the columns are equally compelling, and after a few plays you sort of figure out the ideal upgrade paths. There's a little variability between plays in terms of which events come out at the end of the game, which can fluctuate your strategy between two focuses, but once you've seen both, there doesn't seem to be much else for you to experience.

I'm not thrilled about how the city spots (where most of the points come from in the game) get completely filled up in the round before the final one, or best case right at the start of the final round. This leads to a really anti-climactic final round. I'm also not completely sure about the design decision to limit the shield tokens you can pick up by color, and then additionally vary those tokens with different numbers of printed points between 2 and 4 for the same shield token. This creates somewhat artificial point differentials between players for accomplishing the same sets.

I found the dice rolling to be an interesting way to implement randomness into a euro without making it players-specific (every player gets the same choices).The game had a lot of good mechanics integrated into it which I found to be enjoyable.

I really did not care for the theme--at all. The game ran long, mostly due to analysis paralysis more than anything. This also noticeably caused less table discussion to take place which kind of impedes on fun. As a result I think I'd prefer playing another Euro that feels less mathy and flows better.

[u]The Positive[/u]
(+) Very streamlined rules: easy to teach and learn, but hard to master.

(+) The dice-action-selection mechanic in which high numbers make for cheaper actions and possibly more powerful helper abilities but also make you reach a certain max cap related to obtaining a significant reward more quickly, creates a good tension and balances the game nicely. This mechanic leaves players in control while still limiting the options, creates interesting decision making and ties the whole thing together elegantly.

(+) Game mechanic in which at the end of the game you only score rows of favor tiles in which at least 3 tiles are placed works nicely.

(+) Signorie offers some really nice engine building aspects in which you can place 'helpers' (I call them 'advisors') in order to upgrade future actions. Careful placement of these advisors early on in the game offers meaningful strategic considerations. There are also some engine building aspects in maximizing careers of your sons in order to open up opportunities to obtain the right favor tiles and score big points. I appreciate the elegant implementation of such mechanisms into the game: they increase replayability and offer different paths for players to build up their own game.

(+) The game keeps spawning interesting choices and offers interesting decisions: Will you spend money in order to try to use 4 action dice in stead of only 3 and still get the reward? Will you simply ignore the reward and enjoy the freedom of using the dice you want? How will the sequence of bonus tiles determine your strategy? How much are you willing to invest in getting advisors out? Should you focus them in order to upgrade one or two specific actions, or should you spread them out? Should you go for a favor tile early or can you wait for a better opportunity to pop up? Will you be 'spending' your children to activate assignment tiles or do you need them for carreers and marriages?

(+) The game overloads players with points. Players will continiously race each other on the points track and if all play reasonably well, it is unlikely that players will be left behind too far, which keeps everybody engaged.

(+) Rolling the dice to see wheter sons or daughters are born is actually quite exciting :) Overall, despite this game being rather mechanical, it is easy to have fun with the theme nevertheless: there is some harmless 'simulated' fun to be had when 'politically incorrectly' deciding to send off your son to the monastery or the army, to marry off your daughter just for the sake of opportunity, to send out two sons in order to promote your ugly daughter so you can get rid of her in marriage too and it even seems like it was possible as the head of family to decide to turn some daughters into sons or the other way around without their approval. Some might take offence to this, but it still remains a game and I appreciate the occasional laughs to be had around the table while playing a rather deep game which involves a lot of thinking and planning.

[u]The Negative[/u]
(-) The board, while being functional in displaying the necessary information, looks bland and boring. It almost looks like this production got rushed?

(-) Downtime is an issue here, as players will often only be able to think about their move when the player before has selected an action die. This game involves a lot of waiting and that's why it might last a little longer than it should.

(-) Over all the game is rather balanced, but some chaotic moments may cause some frustration. It is a lot of fun when an opponent already having a bunch of daughters and deperately needing a son rolls 4 additional daughters (or the other way around). When it happens to you - and believe me, it will happen to at least one or two players! - not so much fun... The way the favor tiles and especially assignment tiles get distributed is also prone to some chaos: a small and unmeaningful unanticipated decision of an opponent unawaringly effecting a city may totally srew over your plan for the favor tiles and an assignment tile offering you a much needed action landing on the wrong spot during round set-up can be rather devastating. Those elements make that, while the game sometimes pretends to be strategic (with the sequence of bonus tiles, the plan from the start to collect the right favor tiles, placing the right helpers in order to aid you in the rest of the game), it might actually disappoint strategists, but it will appeal to tactical players.

(-) And now for the real biggie: the end game of Signorie is flawed. In stead of a climactic finale to determine the outcome of the race on the points track that has been going on from the start of the game, the final round or two falls totally flat when (in a 4-player game) the cities get filled by meeples eventually locking out at least half of the interesting decision making, leaving players behind with trying to find unsatisfying stupid ways of scoring marginal points by uninspiredly moving up on a few point tracks. [i]Edit: This is a real problem, which however did get solved with an official variant published on the 'Whats Your Game'-website. After having tested the game with [url=http://www.whatsyourgame.eu/downloads/Signorie_rules_VariantsENGlow.pdf]these alternations[/url]: 'Open Gates' and especially 'A shorter season', I can confirm that this issue has been dealt with and the game runs much more smoothly until the finish. 

[u]Conclusion[/u]
Signorie is a wonderful tactical game which has some really neat mechanics in its core, captivating players with meaningful and interesting decisions from the get go. The game is remarkably accessible due to an elegant rule set, but it is sure to challenge even the most experienced game veterans. All those elements add to the potential of this game to become a favorite, but unfortunately, despite the easy and intuitive rule set, the game suffers from downtime issues and takes a longer play time than one would expect from such a title. The game offers some cool strategic options with different approaches to try out, but turns out to induce a little too much chaos to stay true to its promise of real strategy. The standard game suffers from horribly flawed end game situations leading to a disappointing finale, but this problem has been efficiently dealt with with the publication of two rule variants, ensuring a good gameplay experience until the very end of the game. When using the variant 'A shorter season', the game performs well benefitting from being a little shorter, yet still offering plenty of depth and avoiding a disappointing finale in which some important game mechanics will likely choke up.

My view is that this publication likely got rushed with the need to publish variants to fix some serious issues and a rather bland graphical design, but do not make the mistake of letting these issues leading you to the conclusion of letting this game down. With the rule fixes there is real gameplay-beauty to be found in Signorie which offers a very clever game engine which runs on an elegant and limited rule set everybody can understand and enjoy.

This game takes longer than you might think from a game consisting of 6 or 7 rounds with max 4 actions/player in each round...

Approx 40 min / player


[u]Tips[/u]
(*) In order to avoid a situation in which at the end of the game all interesting opportunities to generate points have vanished, make sure you use the official variants 'A shorter season' (and maybe 'Open Gates') as described [url=http://www.whatsyourgame.eu/downloads/Signorie_rules_VariantsENGlow.pdf]here[/url]. Concerning 'A shorter season', I am a fan of the suggestion of Paul Grogan to skip round 7 in stead of round 1 (as described in the official variant). In this interpretation of Paul Grogan, after playing round 6 you immediately score the 7th bonus tile as an unconditional end game bonus open for every player.
(*) Invest in some helpers early on, they will aid you considerably
(*) The rewards (including opportunities for marriages and more offspring!) are very significant, especially in early rounds. Try not to miss more than one of them!
(*) Using diplomatic missions with sons who have progressed greatly on the career tracks is a very significant points generator - more so than obtaining the favour tiles themselves. The career tracks also are a significant source for money.
(*) If you are going for favor tiles, try to get some high scoring tiles early in the game, they could run out more quickly than you think.
(*) Money in this game is tight - especially in the beginning, but having a lack of sons and daughters will get you into trouble even more quickly, be mindful of this (get your sons married by obtaining rewards!).
(*) Turn order is important in this game: being able to pick the most contested dice early is a very significant advantage, just as getting first dibs on favor tiles is. Moreover, you can score significant points on the initative (book) track: do not ignore this!

Signorie has a very cool dice drafting mechanic, but it feels a little too long, and there's not enough tension. You have time to do pretty much everything you want, and the game starts to feel repetitive by the end. Combine that with the uneven strength of the helpers, and I don't think this is something I would want to play very often. That said, it was a lot of fun the time I played it. Playing with a variant where you play fewer rounds would help though.

RATING: 7
Played once with 4P. As with the earlier Zhangguo, Signorie is about taking the preset number of actions allotted to you and improving on them as the game goes by. At the core of it is a neat dice mechanism which pushes you to draft either low or high values, depending on the game situation. A strength of Signorie is that it has fairly short and accessible rules. Yes, the dependency on a multitude of icons – as typical from the publisher – is still present, but it is more constrained here and I didn't need to repetitively flick through the reference sheet. There are also fewer hoops to jump through to get things done, which can only be a welcome thing.

On the downside, the AP at the start of each round is considerable as players mentally work out the optimal order of dice to take. This is also possibly the driest game thematically and graphically from the publisher, who is already not well-known for making thematically engaging games. Finally, I would agree with the other users that the game lasts a round too long, as a good portion of the last round saw all the cities filled up and players mucking about for a point or two. I think the variant of having a round less could be implemented with little detriment to the gameplay.

RATING: 5.4
Too complex for its own good, without adding any real value from the complexity.

There also are several options that I barely used because they hardly seemed worth the price, but that still made thinking about the next move even harder. For example, the 10 special actions that need to be shuffled every round seem to make sense almost exclusively towards the end game when you don't know anymore what else to do with your meeples.

Most people in our group also were at least at one time or the other quite confused by the symbols, especially what number means what, the special meaning of "..3" and "3...", et cetera.

Perhaps my rating here is a bit overly harsh, as there are a number of good things going on here. I really like how you have to manage your money and which dice you select very carefully to get bonuses at the end of each round. I enjoy how you can get helper actions to make you more effectively when you take a given action. I like the sequencing of the actions, which makes you have to decide whether or not you want to take a given die on a given action early or late. The only thing that is pulling it back is that I think the game goes on one round too long. After the sixth round, a couple of players had very little to do, and the others could only eke out a couple more points. I think it would be far more interesting if you were forced to make some more difficult choices, knowing that you had only six rounds and your actions were more limited.

Solid, neatly balanced (vs. actions) dice-drafting game, with lots of options/point salad. Fun to play, but it kinda overstays its welcome (plays long).

I really like how women/men are separated and function differently (that was the historical time, after all). 

I enjoyed the game, but was not engaged as thematically as I would have liked because our decision-trees (while mechanically sound) were slightly dry.

tl;dr: dry as a desert but very good

This is definitely a What's Your Game? game. The graphic design gives it away, but other than that, it is yet an other deep strategy game that is very dry and has dice.
After the explanation of the rules everything was clear, except I had no clue of what to do to be successful in the game. By the second round things started becoming clear though, so it was enjoyable to explore those options.
There is a certain amount of luck. The flags for the male and female members you can send to the board can come out in a very unlucky way, and the dice can screw you over if you're out of a certain gender and really need those, but strategy is certainly what the game is all about.
Very solid, but very, very, very, VERY dry!

The first play melted my brain, but it could have been just because I was so tired.  Lots of things going on.  I understand that we played some rules wrong, which I think extended the length of the game.  I'd try it again.  

Update after a couple of more plays:  Really good dice selection / light engine building game. Lot of moving parts but they all mesh together well. The balancing act of wanting to use high numbered dice but also wanting to keep your total low enough to get the end of round bonus is really great.

RATING: 6.9
I've been thinking of adding this one to my collection for a while, and there are two big things holding me back. The first, which I am addressing in this order primarily because it's faster, is the replayability. The mixing of the various symbols and the reordering of the assignments and bonuses for each round just doesn't change enough. I've played this game twice and I expect it will wear out within three or four more plays.

The second, which has probably been argued out thoroughly in the forums (never read the comments!), is the sexism inherent in the game design. Yes, it's true to historical convention, at least to the layman's understanding (and again, there's probably a whole pile of well-actually that goes on top of that and I don't care). Yes, it's really just theme and I could probably rearrange things so that 1's produce tomboys and 6's produce fops. But there's really no getting around the fact that the feeples (?) in this game are intended to be married off or consigned to produce heirs (and that's putting it delicately). When I explain rules to the table, I'm going for an amused or hyped up reaction, not "...really?". And that makes this game a hard sell to my group -- the best pitch I can come up with is that we're all playing as Tywin Lannister (or equivalent), and so our callous disregard for our progeny can be explained away.

I still think it's a good game, but these two factors mean that I'll likely be playing out the rest of its lifespan on someone else's dime, rather than acquiring it for myself.

A fine, somewhat new use of dice that nicely creates ambivalent strategies (Discounts vs. rewards) with a Goa-esque techtree to make your basic actions more efficient during the course of the game. Add two types of "workers" and off you go. Like with any other good Euro style boardgame, a monochromatic strategy won't make you succeed whereas taking too many paths will see you failing just as well. The game delivers a solid fun part and it demands some thought, although I definitely wouldn't list it as a medium - heavy game but rather a  medium weight game with minor tendencies to being a "lightish" medium game.

Decent design, fairly deep decisions to be made. Familiar action selection mechanisms with a bit of competition for the victory point tiles. A bit long between turns, a bit AP prone at times. Not a luck fest, but for a game this long the luck of the tile draws and dice rolls played too big of a role.

RATING: 7
Signorie is a game that I was on the fence about. It looked interesting, but I haven't always loved "What's your Game" games. They tend to feel like they're being complex for complexity's sake. But I took a chance and decided to pick this up.

Signorie is a dice drafting game which is largely about sending your children off to gain you alliances with other families. There's five colors of dice, each tied to a different set of actions. You roll as many dice of each color as there are players. Then in turn order, you all take a die. You can do this up to four times a round, but you can only pick a die of a particular color once. So no one is every screwed out of a die because someone else took the last one. However, someone can take the die with the pip value you wanted and screw you that way. And in fact, that's almost guaranteed to happen.

There are two reasons that pip value is important. First, all the action spots have a different cost (Yellow = 1, Red = 2, Purple = 3, Gray = 4 and Teal = 5) and if your die value is below the cost of that action, you must make up the difference in coins. Second, there's an end of round bonus that you only get if your dice values total 13 or less. So often, there's a dance to see who can get low dice values first in order to be able to take 4 dice and still qualify for the round bonus. But taking low dice on the higher cost actions means you pay more money which can be tight, especially in the early game. Plus, getting the right value dice may conflict with taking the actions you want to do, or at least the order you want to do them in.

Each action spot lets you either a) do an assignment b) hire a helper or c) do a signorie action. There are ten assignment actions. They are randomly assigned to different colors each round. So each color will have two assignments tied to it each round. These generally allow you to spend sons or daughters to do variations of the main signorie actions. The hire a helper spot allows you to spend money to put a helper disc on a spot in the column to the left of the column you're in. So if you hire a helper in the red column, you'll place that helper in the yellow column. Helpers are permanent additions that trigger whenever you take an action of that color and give you some bonus ability.

The signorie actions are get 3 money (yellow), marry a daughter off (red), have offspring (purple), send a son on a diplomatic mission (gray) and 4 advancement points on the various tracks. Getting 3 money is pretty self-explanatory. Having offspring means you roll a die for every married couple in your family (you start with one and each round you have a chance to marry one of your four sons) and get children (1-3 = girl, 4-6 = son). The advancement points can be spent to train your sons in politics, clergy or military. They can also be spent on an initiative track which can give you points and/or improve your turn order.

Marrying a daughter and sending a son on a diplomatic mission are tied to gaining alliances with other families. Alliance tiles are randomly placed on the board each round, with one marriage and one diplomatic mission alliance tile put in each city. You have four "plans" for alliances. A plan for gaining alliances through diplomatic missions by sending your sons from the politics, religion and military career tracks, and a plan for marrying into the other five families for your daughter.

You can always send a son or daughter to a city to marry or do a mission, but ideally you want to also claim an alliance tile. The alliance tiles are tied to a family (shown by a family crest) and range in value from 2 - 5. If the tile doesn't match your alliance plan, you can't take the alliance tile. Additionally, any plans where you don't get at least 3 tiles won't score any of those alliance tiles at the end of the game.

In order to take a son's alliance tile, you must send a son from a career where the tile he's taking matches an unfilled niche in that career's alliance plan. If your plan for military, for example, doesn't include any Medici crests, then your son from the military track can't claim that crest for his plan. Additionally, if it did include one Medici crest, but you've already taken one, you can't take more. As cities fill up, your sons must be trained more and more in order to qualify to go into a city. But you get victory points for sending out sons, and the more trained your son, the more VP's you get.

Your marriage plan includes one crest from every important family. So you can only claim the marriage alliance for each family once. However, you must pay a dowry when marrying a daughter, which will score you double that number of points. As cities fill up, you have to pay a larger dowry (up to 4 coins). You can always choose to overpay up to 4 coins just to get VP's.

There's a lot of special abilities in the assignment tiles, helper actions, and end of round awards, but they're pretty much all variations on the main actions or ways to break the rules (like allowing you to qualify for the end of round bonus even with 13+ pips, gender swapping kids, scoring points, etc.)

I really enjoyed the game (despite doing poorly). There's a ton to think about every turn. There's a lot of interesting decisions to make. Enough that it's a little overwhelming on a first play.

The game does have some randomness in what alliance tiles come out, what those values are, and whether they match the alliance plans you've aimed for. It can be a little frustrating when there's no alliance tile you can build, or if the alliance tile you wanted comes out on a turn when you aren't first in turn order instead of on a turn when you are. That's my one big criticism of the game, although it's probably not a huge one at that.

Weird theme of marrying off women and sending men to be successful that is highly abstracted.  For some reason it took a long time for it to click with me when playing.  There's some neat choices from making upgrades and choosing dice, but also a lot of weird mechanisms that didn't make sense.  Some rough edges that I wish were sanded down and game could feel a bit more fluid.  

Also the turn order thing is really annoying, you have to constantly fight to not be last.  If players are farming books as their point engine, by merit they're also getting first place repeatedly, the only way you can trump it is by passing on an action and defaulting to first.  Just weird.

Tweaks to the turn order rule, more intuitive symbols or words on the board, and trimming the fat and I think I could have liked the game quite a bit more.

Fun dice mechanic, but a lot of the game seems unrefined. While the game seems like it should have multiple paths to victory, I think that this is a bit of an illusion.  Helpers are incredibly powerful if taken early (some even more than others), so there is no choice but to spend the first few turns grabbing them.

Game feels like it could have been much improved by tightening up the reward criteria and limiting some of the helper actions.

Dice draft worker placement where Heads of noble families in 15th Century Italy position and scheme for dominance. Draft color dice for actions and value determines cost within a 13 point cost constraint--cool. The juicy aspect of the game is hiring as many helpers with what's available in pool that still trigger the bonus actions. Marry your daughters and send them with dowry's, educate your children in military, diplomacy, and clergy to settle regional conflicts and create alliances. Build influence and succession with childbirth. Money is tight so choices count. Family missions, end of the round bonuses, and all your decisions need to match the objectives of your family plan.  A lot of intrigue packed in an elegant system. If you dig this theme you dig this game. With daughters myself, I wish the girl family members were more than just to be married off and baby factories.  Though historically accurate it's just unfortunate.

Solid game. I felt rearranging the envelope tiles every turn screwed up the flow of the game. I also felt like the game went on a little too long - 1-2 fewer turns would have made this feel much smoother. Again, overall solid but lacking a wow factor. 

Update with second play: I again feel like this game is solid. There’s a lot to like here but it’s just overshadowed by other games with more visual appeal, less downtime at four players, and a shorter playtime. Given the time this one takes, I’d just rather play something else.

The mechanics in this game provide me an outlet to use my imagination for theme.  When I marry people off in the game I mentally give them names and a reason to marry them off.  When children are born I name them and create a fake destiny profile for them.  After the male family members complete diplomatic missions I secretly praise their success and thank them for their servitude to the family name.

Reasonably middleweight Euro game about sending your family members sons/daughters to either diplomatic missions, marrying off your daughters or making your sons working their way up the chain in 3 different tracks (military, clerical and political)

- Quite abstract, dry
- Theme isn't that great
- I felt the 3 tracks didn't really do all that much; its just a route to get your sons on the board.
- Too easy to fall behind if you are unable to get your sons from the 3 tracks onto the board.

I think it was an okay game, its probably not for me though

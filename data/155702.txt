GAME: Quarriors! Light vs. Dark
RANK: 2703

RATING: 8
if you are used to the old rules you need a couple of plays to get used to the the new ones. Still unrated because I need to try with the old sets.

RATING: 6.5
The weakest set yet. The new light/dark mechanic doesn’t really fit with the rest of the game.

I love this game!  It's just so...quirky.  I love randomness in games, so this is perfect for me.

RATING: 7
Like some of the new mechanics like using the larger quidity dice but do not like the reduced number of spell and creature cards in play and the removal of the rule where only culled dice are scored. May end up blending the new dice into the previous rules but will try the rules as they are first.

I'll admit, I like the quidity approach in this version is quite a bit better than the original. The problem is that Dice Masters is actually better, in my opinion, than any version of Quarriors.

More variety for the basegame

As an alternative you can use the new light/dark mechanism for an even more diverse gameplay.

Nice update of Quarriors, a number of systemic improvements over the classic version make it more playable and a little more interesting and less swingy, in a good way. Sadly, it's still all about getting huge creatures early by rolling a lot of Quiddity, so it's not enough to convince me to get Quarriors back into the rotation (I sold off all my old sets a while ago). Plus, disappointing quality control and usability - dice are almost worse than first printing Quarriors, which is shame, because a) that's really not good, and b) at one point they had this right, with much clearer dice and larger and more readable numbers and burst symbols.

Fixes Quarriors to be a bit more better. The new Quiddity dice allows you to roll a guaranteed amount of actual dice.

It is a whole new game. No culling when you score. Light and Dark and regular Quidity. You can cast spells on any card on the table if you have the right light or dark Quidity.

I love the original Quarriors. I love Dice Masters. This version is not for me.
Out of my collection.

Same a Quarrior! but the light and dark powers on the cards are not needed, hard to integrate into the core set. I do like the new rule set, I play it with the original game.

RATING: 8.5
Light vs. Dark is a standalone base set in the Quarriors gaming family.  It can also be used as an expansion to the original base game.  LvD offers many big changes such as Light and Dark Quiddity, as well as 2 large basic Quiddity dice to replace the 8 smaller ones.  I personally prefer using LvD as an expansion and play with culling variants with the 8 smaller basic Quiddity dice as it retains the flavor of a "deck builder".  Even so, LvD still offers more creatures, more spells, and even 3 different types of Assistants.  Same rating as the original game.

Sort of a reboot of Quarriors, and for me it's not an improvement. This would be a good starting set for a new player, but for experienced players it makes things different enough to be a little awkward (and removes portals!). I think it's meant to be a leaner, streamlined version that can play by itself with a fair amount of complexity compared to the now bloated original whose complexity lies in all its piled on expansions, but give me the piled on (and customizable) expansions version any day!

It's an ok game but I think it's too random. Ok that it's a dice game but when you buy expensive dice and then only have 50% chance of actually using what you bought it gets to you.

Cluttered with a lot of text on the cards and you don't really feel like you are doing something.

RATING: 7.6
Better than normal Quarriors. The new quiddity dice makes the game a lot more fun by removing the quiddity dice drawn from the bag. More fun with the creatures. Will never play with the old (normal) quiddity dice in the future.

However, like most Quarrior expansions, the Light/Dark element is very diluted when mixed with base game and other expansions. The global abilities on some of the new creatures are great (but only work well with Light/Dark creatures).

Plays of this is logged under ordinary Quarriors.

This is a standalone game but all items in this game can be used in combination with the entire Quarrior family, 
the biggest change in this expansion is that they added 2 big dice you have to roll with everytime.
Upside : This reduces the cost of the game causs you don't have an abundance of white dice. 
Downside : Due to this change some tactics will not work anymore.

Stand alone expansion for Quarriors that can be played on its own. Has a light and dark creature/spell mechanic that is pretty interesting. If you like Quarriors its just more good stuff to play with.

This is an interesting expansion/base game of Quarriors. It treats Quiddity dice differently, which is interesting. The light and dark aspect is interesting, too, but I think will require more plays to realize it's potential.

I like the streamlining of using 2 basic quiddity dice each turn.  The variety of assistants is also good.  Removing post-scoring auto-culling also seems good, if it works, which I'm not sure yet.  Biggest downside is compatibility with the rest of Quarriors.  It seems like you probably can't use just a little of the Light and Dark cards.

They changed things around here and not for what I think is the better.  While I was expecting more of an Add-on, I got a "revamp".  They changed the quiddity dice to generate more per turn on average and in a sense it picks up the tempo of the game as well.  I actually like the period of time it takes while everyones dice collection starts to build up steam so this change isn't something I like.  Actually it reminds me a little bit of when Magic changed to pick up the speed, or when D&D changed to make it more like a video game.  Faster is not necessarily better.  The Ladies will back me up on that one. :-)  Anyway, they also split the quiddity into type (light/dark) and while I can say, OK I get it.  I'm again, not a big fan.  I like Quarriors and while I might consider adding the dice to the pool, I don't think I'd go so far as to change my game play to the new rules.

While this is fun on its own it basically changed the core mechanics and doesn’t work with other expansions. Would have rated higher if it would have mixed.

Works badly all around. The Dark/Light mechanic doesn't work with any of the existing sets. Weak creatures were already bad purchases in Quarriors; with D/L you'll be drawing your whole bag every turn or two, so there is absolutely no reason to add the weaker creatures. Get a few big creatures, stop modifying your bag entirely.

This expansion added a nice starting dice variation, but the light and dark dice themselves do not play as well diluted with all the other expansions. Still a nice stand alone box that plays more similarly to Dice Masters than the base Quarriors.

Hey, you know how deckbuilding has a bit too much luck generally? Let's add some dice, so that you will have zero control over what happens! Also take away the building part, just buy some more dice and roll them. I think people will realize this isn't a great game, so let's make it so short nothing really happens in it!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
If you're hoping to mix this version with the base Quarriors set or any of its expansions, dispose of that thought immediately.  This expansion doesn't play well with others due to the light/dark special requirements.

If you treat the game as a stand-alone variant, which is exactly what it is, it's OK.  The oversized and overpowered "starter" dice are interesting, though a pair of fuzzy dice would have been preferred.  After all, I did grow up in the 70s.

Not much new here, so probably not worth the time/money overall.  Unless you get it for half-price, which is likely given how unpopular this expansion seems to be.

Offers more to the game and strategy than just some new cards/creatures. The anchoring spells are great, the light and dark mana keeps things fresh, and the the new larger dice that don't go back in the bag was a much needed change. This expansion plays very well with the others but also as a stand alone.

The updates to the game rules are nice refinements.  Keeping the blah Quiddity dice out of your bag means that every draw will be interesting… and that Corrupted Quiddity dice are much more annoying, as they should be.

RATING: 10
Have only played once and already I'm only deducting a point for all the maintenance required. Could rise higher depending on how subsequent plays go. 

This is a sandbox full of violent weapons. I couldn't help but grin as the array of ways to use others for your own ends slowly unfolded, and I'm sure I'm just scratching the surface. Just from my first short game: 

- The B&O player stalled early and I bought shares to force it to float, so that he'd be shoved into buying 2 trains, because I wanted access to the 3s without buying any more 2s.

- I narrowly avoided having the NYC dumped on me by what felt like sheer luck as the president wasn't sure it was optimal for him 

- I picked up the C&O to complement the PRR as it seemed sensible (and that does appear to be a common pairing), they co-ordinated station placements and shuffled money between them via train purchases as needed. Probably very basic 18xx stuff but it's a layer you just don't get from games like Imperial 

- One of the experienced players showcased a bit of turn order manipulation via share price management. I believe my response was "jeez, like this game needed more layers"

I fear I shall soon go the way of the "18xx Master Race"... another round?

RATING: 7
There are tons of decisions to be made for the finances, but the biggest trouble I had was with the rail tile placements and figuring out optimal routes.  The game really drags in the last few rounds, because choosing routes and totaling incomes can take for damn ever.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Classic and still fun to play despite being way too long and quite boring in the later rounds. For all 18xx games, I find the stock rounds are excellent and intriguing while the operating rounds are boring and tedious.

RATING: 7
Very cool system! Retains a good amount of historicity while keeping the level of uncertainty needed to make it an interesting investment game. 

Probably will move onto other 18xx games - even after one play - as many seem to offer more instability in the companies, which leads to a fiercer and more dynamic stock market.

I have only played this 2 player, so can't offer an accurate opinion of the game at its best (4 players + I believe), but I saw enough over those 6.5 hours to know that this game isn't for me. I love Poseidon and thought that I could sustain playing a similar game for that long, but just got bored. No doubt, it's a masterful design, but I won't be hankering to play again. I can get a short stock-market fix with Black Friday. For network building, I can play Power Grid. Friedemann Friese ticks both those boxes for me and leaves me with little need for 1830. 

Traded away for Tigris and Euphrates.

This is a /long/ game but I imagine it gets shorter with time. Listed scenarios also give some variety beyond the players choice. Still a great share game although I'm unsure of a couple of rules (e.g. Bank only holding 50% of shares and ability to tank a share per share round).

RATING: 8
I imagine that, for the typical board game geek nerd, 1830 is the Platonic idea of a board game. Not in that "normal person" way of describing a good board game. You know, board games that are easy to grasp, that take a reasonable amount of your time and that are actually fun to play. 
1830 is nothing like that. 1830 can be mind-mindbogglingly difficult, takes ridiculously long to finish, and, let's be honest, is not very entertaining PER SE. But for me, in a very abstract way, it is still the epitome of board-gamy-ness. It teaches patience for the complexity of board games. It requires you to become - not necessarily a better person - but definitely a better board gamer.

It is fun to play in the same way that a marathon is fun to run. Not at all PER SE, but you're still happy and proud you did it (once it is over). 

Even though it is hard to admit, I DO love 1830.

RATING: 5.5
Mostly played via the DOS game and now found a few players for real life games, looking forward to playing it.

After multiple plays I'm tiring of it, I much prefer more modern 18xx games with streamlined track, half the game is laying the right tile at the right time and it's too subtle for my liking in a 4 hour game. Most of the companies are poor and i'm bored of 3d stock markets where all you do is buy and sell shares to cripple prices and mess with operating order, then the player to their left gets priority so one player in a game dominates turn order.

The gameplay is excelent (I'm very fondof luckless gameplay), and the old computer version of this was one of my favorite PC games, but the problem with the board game is that to enjoy it you need at least 3 completely ruthless oponents - do not play this with people that do not appreciate and enjoy treachery and backstabbing!  Playing this as a "friendly game" would knock it down to a 6 or 5 for me.

You need to be a 18XX fan to really enjoy the game and others in the series.  Can be quite cutthroat, you can end up to be the president of a rail company with no cash and need to upgrade the train which will require taking cash out of your own pocket.  Very devastating strategy if done right.  Probably why some of my friends rate it 1.  This depicts the Robber Barons aspect quite well.  You need to lay the right tile and place your station in optimal location to generate the most profitable run for the company you control.  Most common complaint is the stock selling since there is no restrict on amount whereas you can only buy 1 share per turn.

I didn't like this much at first, preferring the smoother edges of its nearly identical twin 1889, but it has definitely grown on me. 

After a few more plays, this is my favorite 18xx. This is a 10 if playing computer assisted.

RATING: 9
A classic game that I played a great deal in the eighties and early nineties. 1830 is a network building game like Poker is about cardplay; despite appearances, they are both games of money management.  1830's great innovation over its 1829 predecessors was a much more fluid stockmarket, with the value of shares falling as they are sold.  Stock manipulation is a key part of this game.  Despite the absence of random elements, 1830 has so many strategic and tactical possibilities that each game is different.  1830 is also unforgiving; small misjudgements, typically around the pace at which trains are upgraded, have a way of snowballing.

The endgame too often resolves into a repetitive series of operating rounds, with minimal track improvements, waiting for the bank to run out. That aside, 1830 is a near perfect design, albeit one that I burned out on.  It has been ages since I played it and it's about time I blew the dust off.

Demasiada expectación con este juego llevó a una lógica decepción en la partida que jugué a su reedición.

No acaba de convencerme el sistema de estos juegos de trenes. 

En partidas de muchos jugadores son extremadamente largos y en el momento que se rompe la partida es muy complicado remontar (quedando aún mucho tiempo de de juego hasta el final).

Son vistosos y a priori interesantes, pero luego en la práctica se me hacen un poco aburridos.

Aún así no discuto que tienen una legión de fieles seguidores que avalan el sistema.

This is certainly one of the greatest rail games ever designed.  Age of Steam might be seen as a "lite" version, and that's no insult to either game.  Sadly, I've only played this game with live opponents once, though I have played the excellent Simtel port dozens (if not hundreds) of times.  

A bit long by modern standards, but oh, the detail: stock issues, sales, and trades.  Operating lines for fun and profit.  Recommended.

RATING: 8
Lots to consider in this brain-burning and highly influential game.  Yet it's also a somewhat dated and flawed masterpiece.  The pre-game auction of the private railroads helps to "seed" the game but is also extremely important and a poor bid there can affect the entire game.  So it's not exactly newbie-friendly.  Whets my appetite for playing other 18XX games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The first of the 18xx games with a heavy focus on stock manipulation and agressive play.  There is a remarkable amount of variability in the game, even though the development of the map centers around a few key hexes.

This is better than many of the games that followed it due to the fact that it's one of the cleanest and simplest games in the series.  This is one of the better places to start with 18xx, though it's not very forgiving of mistakes.

After trying out several other 18xx, I still find this one to be king of the hill. While not having as many twists or innovative ideas on the standard formula as some others, this is where the standard formula comes from... 

I think it helps that it has just the right level of complexity, just enough to have plenty of depth, but not so much as to make it hard to play or overly long. There's basically nothing that is there just for the sake of being different, and the whole works like a well oiled machine where it's easy to see the role of all the parts, but hard to understand how to make the whole work properly. On the other hand, it helps that this is the one I've played most, so my opinion might change as I get to know other games better.

The rating reflects my opinion of 18xx as a whole, beyond just 1830. For the moment, though, this is my favourite game of the series and the standard against which the others are measured, so it is appropriate for this particular game as well.

Röviden: a játék nagyon jó, de túl hosszú! Életemben először el kellett jönnöm játék közben, és más szállt be helyettem, mert nem kalkuláltam azzal, hogy reggel 10-es kezdéssel nem fog beleférni este 8-ig! A szabálymagyarázat bő két óra volt, a tiszta játékidő pedig bő 8 óra (végül este 11-ig tartott), amit sokallok, bár a hivatalos 300 perces játékidőből sejthettem volna, hogy alulbecsülöm (4-5 órás tiszta játékidőre számítottam).
Pozitívumok: vitathatatlanul a legjobb, legéletszerűbb, legmélyebb részvényes mechanizmus, amit eddig próbáltam. Mintha egy magasabb szintű Imperial lenne... És egyben a legbonyolultabb vonatos játék is, a Steam emellett elbújhat összetettségben. A részvények árfolyamainak mozgása apró részletességgel ki lett dolgozva, a nagyobb vasúttársaságok kialakulása a kisebbekből valószínűleg történelmileg megalapozva került a játékba, mindezek együtt átélhetővé teszik az egyébként száraz mechanizmust. Nagyon jól eltalált dilemmák vannak belekódolva, a legfontosabbak: mennyi pénzt szedjünk ki a társaságokból, hogy azok még ne menjenek csődbe..., illetve mennyire törekedjünk vezető szerepre az egyes cégeknél. Tetszik a korszakok változása, a játék dinamikussága: ha nem figyelünk, gyorsan háttérbe szorulhatunk a térképen, vagy elveszíthetjük mozdonyainkat, ezáltal hanyatlásnak indulhat a cég, magába szippantva az összekuporgatott magánvagyonunkat is. A vége feltétel nagyon érdekes: addig tart a játék, amíg ki nem ürül a bank. És mindez egy nagyon szép játék is ráadásul. Szinte teljesen nyelvfüggetlen. Különböző variánsokkal még feldobható, mi a lapkák felét nem is használtuk kb.
Negatívumok: a hosszán kívül a nagy holtidő nem tetszett, és a megfelelő sínek keresgélését (a három féle szín ellenőrizgetését) kicsit körülményesnek éreztem néha, a játék ereje inkább a részvényes része, és nem az építgetés.
Összességében nagyon ajánlom vonat fanoknak, és a keményebb játékok kedvelőinek: a hosszú szabály és hosszú játék garantált.

new edition:

component quality great at first glance, but at the second glance several issues:
  - reusing train cards with private companies, with some of the variant trains/privates used on one side and classic on the other makes the result fiddly and feeling 'cheap'. 
  - it would've been a lot nicer if the stock market tokens where not identical on both sides, to mark which company has moved..
  - stock market is graphically badly designed. the flatter spaces, with no space to place the tokens without hiding the price underneath, and with the irregular diagonals of this title together sum up to really hinder play.
  - I would be a LOT happier if the extra money for thick tiles (which do not add anything to the experience) went towards wooden tokens (especially for stock market) which would ease the play a LOT
  - why doesn't the classic side use old style graphics? it makes the old style tiles a joke - the publisher knew they will be useless, and is just making fun of the old timers by half-including the old look. 

all in all - I hope the new scenarios are worth it. I am very likely to play classic 1830 with the old edition rather than this new one, which quite frankly is shocking me. means that the new edition is quite fucked up afterall... [edit: once you try reading into scenarios number of unanswered rules questions that come up suggest the variants weren't playtested]

Initial Impression: This is my first 18xx game and I enjoyed it. The stock manipulation is what I enjoy most, and I find the track laying is a bit boring.

I think I would like this game more if it was a few rounds shorter.

The best of my "10" games, my #1. Incredible gaming experience. It's not too deep--I've had heavyweight players play 1830 (they'd wipe the floor with me in the big AH brain burners, but I had them on equal footing in 1830). Our weakest Rail Baron player quickly grasped the stock market and how to max revenue from the rails; he ended up beating the better RB players in 1830. It has balance, excitement, great decisions but surprisingly little analysis paralysis.  A real masterpiece.

My first 18xx game. I used to think this was a good place to start learning the 18xx system but I now find it is too much an outlier on the "nasty" side and recommend 18EU/18AL/18GA instead.  So many decisions and options, nice interactions between Action A and Result R which at times are not obvious.  Bringing a strategy to fruition in this game is a thrill seldom seen in other games.  We played this to death, to the point that it doesn't get played much anymore, and we've moved on to some of the other 18xx offerings.

Bought on impulse and ended up being sold due to the unlikeliness of it being played any time soon. It is likely it will be bought again sometime in the future if I devote the time to learn 18XX. I suspect 1846 will end up being the first.

Wow.  This is quite good. My rating could go up by playing it with more than 3.  We all were noobs and had no idea on how to really get moving early but we worked our way through and had a great time.  It was one that I thought about for awhile after...what I could have done different, etc.  \

Not as bad as I feared it would be. I'm not a math or stock market guy (I still prefer Railways of the World), but I had to dip my toe into the deeper end of the railroad game pool.

- They're too long.
- They typically have openings that aren't randomized at all.
- They're too long.
- Their tiles feature the colors puke yellow, puke green, brown and grey.  Are you kidding me?

Played a five player game.  There is definately a lot going on in this.  We had one player that was definately going to be bankrupt as he was going to have to buy a train.  By the time we got to him, he was the last company to run, received enough money, by $23, to keep the game going.  The game ended up going many more turns.  There are many swings in the game and you need to keep track of the position of the Priority Card, this can make or break you.  Very good game that will get many plays.

RATING: 9.5
The quintessential Railroad game and best known of the 18XX series. A combination of adroit railroad operation and timely stock market exploitation is needed to be successful at this game. Of the extensive 18XX family, this game is perhaps the most cutthroat - buying and selling stock to manipulate stock values, raiding companies, and deliberately laying track/stations to impede others are hallmarks of the play style.

There is not a single bit of randomness beyond the initial determination of player order, and player experience will be solidly rewarded; hence, the best games will be among those whose experience and mastery of the game is at a reasonably even level. Novices will find the game extremely challenging and unforgiving, but persistence will provide an increasingly rewarding gaming experience.

However, this game is quite complex and fiddly to keep track of all that needs to be recorded and calculated. It can best be learned on the computer in the solitaire mode, and is a great multi-player game when played in the "hot seat" mode, via the AH PC computer game released in the mid 90s. The computer takes care of all the fiddly book-keeping and track management letting the players concentrate on playing. One of the best strategy games ever designed!
++++++
With the release of the long awaited 2nd edition from Mayfair in 2011, this game should be finding a whole new generation of gamers looking for a deeper and more rewarding strategy game experience - particularly those whose love of rail games includes Steam or Age of Steam. The 2nd edition is lovingly crafted but yet again is plagued by careless editing and proofing, perhaps in an attempt to put too much into what was to be a simple reprint of a well known classic. Mayfair really needs to pull up their socks on this sort of thing, but one can't help being impressed by the scope of what had been attempted. Too bad some careless errors marred what could have been a really marvelous resurrection of a classic boardgame.

One of the best 18xx - certainly one of the shortest and best to show newbies. Only problem is it's still fairly long by today's euro-game standards. Wish I could play it more often. ** Update: 18Mex is now my favourite 'short' 18xx game, and probably just as good to show to newbies.

After one play, I still have no idea what's going on.  I need to play it again when I'm not exhausted.  I enjoyed my one play and hope to get to play it again.

2012-08-15: After several more plays, I completely get what all the fuss is about.  Currently my favorite 18xx, although they're all great. 

2013-0-18: In my opinion, the best 18XX "game".  The most player interaction and opportunities for screwage (other than 1817) with very little chrome.

Mar-2015: Burned out on it after 20ish plays.  Still like it and still need to see more aggressive train-buying and yellow strategies, but it's not one I'm excited to play.

Rating based on one five-player game.  Like a combination of Age of Steam and Shark -- heavy and LOONG (particularly since two of us were first-time players), but I see why it's a classic.  Didn't think I'd ever find it for a reasonable price, but YAY for the PrezCon used game auction!

RATING: 5.5
Unfortunately not a fun experience. Seemed like it would be a blend of Steam and Imperial, two games I love, but it just didn't execute well at all.  Obscenely long, we played 6 hours and ended up calling the game before we finished, and I didn't feel I planned a juicy strategy or had great choices to make. The game also crawled to a slog about 4 hours in, where better games (like Imperial or Steam) have more natural game engine progressions that heighten excitement as you get into the final third. Disappointing.

If I understood this one better, I'd up the rating. It's a magnificently devious game. When your corporate partner decides to bail out of an agreement suddently, leaving you destitute, you will find it achingly difficult to get back in the game -- and sadly, because it's a very long game, that's a few hours of unfun for the victim. Now, I LIKE that it's brutal, but I would have preferred if it was easier to get back in the running, or that the game were shorter so the suffering at least didn't last too long. (Can you guess who gets hosed most often when we play?)

After two games, I still don't know how to rate this game. The first turns are great, but then it begins to drag on until it becomes unbearable. I do not like the incredibly limiting set of tiles and catching up once you are behind seems impossible. The funny thing is that I think I enjoy talking about the game more than actually playing it.

The classic train game of all time. Such fun gaming moments with stock market and company dumps. Only minor gripes would be the diesel costs, perhaps lower them a bit and the fact that there's possibly no incentive to save if you can keep ramping up share price and rather pay in from your personal cash. Excellent game.

We got this because it was supposed to be the "most accessible," "most beautiful" 18xx game. We love many heavy Euros, and my husband loves most train-themed games (Railways of the Road, Russian Railroads, Chicago Express, etc.), so I was sure this was going to be a hit.

Oh My God. I knew it would be long, but this game DRAAGGED. After the second or third turn, as rail lines began to intersect, the counting and recounting of optimal routes, the calculation of income, and the counting and dealing out of the paper money took FOREVER. The longer the game went on, the longer each turn (and the interminable counting) took. Never since Outpost have I been so annoyed at having to count my income.

Now, to be fair, we were playing a two-player game which many on BGG don't recommend. With only two players, the burden is too high on two people to buy out all the stocks, and it is exceedingly difficult to maximize actions when you are invested in so many companies: some scaling mechanism should have been implemented to limit the board and/or companies for 2 players. 

The game isn't bad: there are interesting decisions, and I can certainly see getting better with experience. It's just too tedious, convoluted, and fiddly for my taste. Sold.

This is a wonderful gamers' game if you don't mind the length and complexity and what can be a painful learning curve - playing against experienced gamers means you're most likely to learn by your mistakes and there's no safety net available. The track laying is similar to its pre-decessor 1829 but it's the rich dimension added by the stock market shenanigans which make it really zing for me.

Played the D scenario once. It was pretty good, I think it'll be fun for hardened 1830 players to try something new, or for long-time players who haven't played it before to introduce the game to new players with. It didn't quite feel right to me with 4 players though - it felt like there were just slightly too many mid-game trains (3s and 4s mainly, perhaps 5s), and the classic endgame crunch takes too long to start - resulting in a slightly over-long and somewhat attenuated game. With 4 anyway, it means the winner will come from the player who starts and runs 3 companies instead of 2. I think with fewer players, it might help to remove some of those trains. Easing up a bit on the rough endgame in 1830 isn't a bad idea, but I think it pulled back too much. But again, I can see it might be quite different with 5 or 6 players.

The 'D' scenario does have a rather different feel from the classic scenario, which is good.

I also can't help but feel like the scenarios might be a little bit too much. What I would have liked to see is a minimally intrusive scenario that helped rebalance things a little bit and mix up the geography: some new or different private & public companies, some rebalanced geography, and that's about it. The new scenario chrome - coalfields, different certificate mixes, different off-board box rules, new tiles, new promotion rules - all strike me as too much. 1830 was great because it was spare, it did what it needed to do then got out of the way. It frustrates me the endless need to add chrome to 18xx variants (I particularly despise '+' trains) when simply changing geography and perhaps slightly re-parameterizing existing structures would be more than enough.

It's also slightly annoying that 1830+ has stuck to the anachronistic tile mix of the original, a mix that was defined by production, not gameplay issues. Some important plain-track green and brown tiles can run short in a very frustrating way. We always played with a double set of plain track (no extra cities or towns), because being screwed because there is only one green 'Y' track in the mix is silly (my '10' rating is based on playing with a doubled plain track mix, I might have to dock it a point if you play with the needlessly constrained mix that comes in the box).
---
Just got the new Mayfair edition, and I have to say that out of the box, it looks really great. I love the customization and scenario options. I bought the new edition because I am a big 1830 fan, but as I mention below, because I've played the basic game so much I wasn't sure I'd actually play the new one. But with the enticing scenarios I can definitely see this coming off the shelf.

One warning, though: the many variants enumerated can have really profound effect on the game, not all of them good. For example, the rules that allows 50/50 dividend splits and delayed obsolescence are both huge and not in my opinion in a good way. Tastes vary, of course, which is why they're there - but I would make sure you are familiar with the game and understand the implications before picking and choosing. Your intuition on what "makes sense" can definitely lead you astray. When I first started playing 1830 I played with the delayed obsolescence rule; when I finally played correctly, I thought "wow, that's a lot better", and understood why the original rule had to be. Anyway, the variants are just a smorgasbord of how people play 18xx, don't assume that because they are in there it means that they make sense or are a good idea (or work well in combination with other variants).

The sole exception I would make is to recommend the extra track tiles. I haven't done a comparison to the original 1830 manifest, but we always played with a second set of "plain" track because there are a couple configurations that were needlessly short (UPDATE: Sadly, the extra track does not address this issue, and there are some needlessly complicated configurations in there, so just grab all the plain track tiles and don't use the rest unless you're playing a scenario that calls for them).

My personal preference is for open corporate cash and closed private cash - I'm actually not sure this is one of the options suggested. I think this is the best mix to provide the key tactical information required to play well, while blocking any decent into needless AP. I think it's clear that given the game is what it is, open corporate cash should be the default preference. People will have different preferences on private cash though.
---
Awesome game, if one with a limited lifespan as it will be eventually "discovered", at which point some of the edge is lost. Nontheless, there is a very long gap between the first play and that point, esepcially if you wisely try to get to that point yourself rather than reading all the online advice :) Another big win for 1830 is that it really isn't that long, about 5 hours after the first game or two, and is just the length it should be. This is one of the best of the 18xx games, and of the longer multi-player games in general. An important caveat, though, is that this game really can't be played with players of significantly differing experience with the game. For this reason, I think 1830 is essentially "dead" at this point for me, but I had a *lot* of fun getting there.

This game, and the 18xx series more broadly, seems fresh and vibrant despite the game being 30 years old (and the concept more than 40).

While the Mayfair edition has some tile misprints (rectified with an errata sheet) and a rulebook I find a little difficult to find my way around, the components are very nice and overall I'm happy to have the extra scenarios, with the one I've played beyond the base game working well in 6 players.

The game itself is a great mix of interesting and interconnected decisions in varying guises: track lays and train purchases, investments and payouts. Once the basics are grasped it's pretty easy to know how to play. What to do, that's more difficult. Trying to spot value is the raison d'etre, the alchemy at the heart of the game.

I only have the PC version that I bought on ebay because all the hype on bgg.

1830 very different from other econ games because you goal is to make your holding company money by investing in rail companies.  Initially you will be tempted to think that your goal is to run a successful company but your goal is to make money by having a highly profitable portfolio of rail stocks.  In essence, you are a portfolio manager of a rail holding company.  You may become a controlling owner or a silent partners of one or more rail companies.  If you control a company you must balance giving money investors, like yourself, or reinvesting funds back into the company for research and development, as well expansion.  To win you must give your investors lots of money but if the company does not expand or at least keep up other rail companies, then you will be holding stock that are not worth as much other companies.

What I enjoy most in this game is the fear. The fear of having a company I'm running ruined by someone else's station or track placement. The fear of having a company I'm invested in ransacked and then dropped in my lap. On the flip side, there is massive money to be made if people don't do that. There is so much potential if we all play nice. Which is where a lot of the tension resides, in predicting the play of others, to determine whether or not they consider a situation to be mutually beneficial or if they will freeze you out.

The game's three biggest problems are its length, its complexity, and its savagery. It's a long game, so every time I play I end up thinking about all the games I could be playing instead. There just doesn't seem to be enough there, for me, considering just how many hours the game takes to play out. In that time I could easily play four or five of my favourite games. It is easily the most complicated game I know. We made rule mistakes most times we played and while some games can survive a rules error, my experiences are that this game can't. One error is like the flap of a butterfly's wings and ends up distorting the whole game an hour or two later. Finally, the brutality of the game means I have to be very particular about who I play with, as some people just don't enjoy having a bankrupted company dropped in their lap or having their money making route blocked off and a profitable company turned into an albatross around one's neck, and you need to enjoy that if you are to play.

I have mostly played this AH classic on the PC. Looks very dated (as you'd expect from a mid-nineties computer game) but has the advantage of taking the work out of the bookkeeping and speeding up the game.

The Mayfair edition is nicely produced but the rulebook isn't great. In my one face-to-face game of this we were left with questions regarding the auctioning of the private companies, bankruptcy, the definition of 'round' and a few other issues causing the (unfinished) game to run over six hours. It felt like a lot of work for not much reward.

My old highschool game group would have freaked over the combination of stock manipulation, empire building, and screw-your-buddy possibilities. I realize this has now largely been "solved" and the hardcore 18xx folks are on to other things... but this sure rocks.

I'm a big fan of long lasting, bidding, commercial, no luck games. 1830 is everythig I look for when it comes to play such a genre. Avoid it if you do not belong to this category else you'll get bored in 10 minutes and propbably will ruin the game to the other players as well.

While certainly a good and very respectable 18XX design, I prefer games which more strongly balance track building and planning with market manipulation.  1830's near total concentration on market manipulation makes for too narrow and skeletal a game for my preferences.

Update: With experience and repeat plays, it is growing on me.  I remain unfond of the very constrained tile set and resulting obsessive patterning of board development.

Update: More plays are relaxing my previous views.  yes, the patterning is extreme, but they are only meta-patterns.  There really is incredibly variation and expressivity in how this game develops.  It may gain another full point with further plays.

Update: Okay, I'm reverting.  The range of variability and patterning in this game is large and wonderfully intense, especially across player counts.  6-player remains my ideal player count.  I'm now elevating this to the heady heights (for me) of a 9.5.

Update: 6-player 1830 is my sweet spot.  The game is good with other player counts, but 6-player is where it really shines.

Update: Demoted a point to 8.5 as a few other titles (eg 1849) have been more interesting.  1830 still holds the crown however for variability and range.

Classic game which is one of the better of an entire genre of games.  Came to this after really liking games like Imperial, and I really enjoyed it.  There is so much going on with the markets and the routes that there is always something to think about.  It is certainly on the longer side, with lots of money changing hands, but it's a great game despite the length.  The computer game is a pretty good way to get a few plays under your belt to learn the mechanics and such.

[UPDATE 1/2016]: Maybe not my undisputed favorite game. But incredibly, amazingly good.

:coffee: :( :what: :) :D :) :) 1830 is an extraordinary game, my favorite game, really, and a useful introduction to the world of 18xx and other complex economic games. It's not for everyone -- it's long, and fairly high complexity, there's some math involved, and while it's a viciously tough game with lots of opportunity for direct confrontation, it's not confrontation of the orc-stabbing/starship-battle variety that people groove on. And you really need to play it a bunch to see what it has to offer, which is tricky when games are 4-5 hours at a go. So you gotta want it. But if it gets under your skin, it gets a hold of you.

How to describe it in a non-hysterical manner? In terms of the games that were influenced by it, 1830 combines the track-building mechanics familiar from Steam/Age of Steam with shareholding/partial ownership mechanics similar to Imperial and Chicago Express. Unlike (Age of) Steam, track is not owned by individual railroads, but railroads can place station tokens in major cities to prevent competitors from tracing routes through them. And the revenue-generation aspect is an abstracted count of connected consecutive cities rather than moving a physical bit on the board. As for the stock-ownership side, shares in the railroad constitute partial ownership, a la Chicago Express, but share prices are on a floating market that respond to the actions of the railroads, and can be sold back to the bank, which is one of the ways the stock price can go down. Sell enough shares, and ownership of the road will change. And also, unlike Chicago Express, stocks are liquidated at the end of the game and sold for their current share value, so increasing share prices of stocks you own and depressing share prices of stocks your opponents are long in is essential for victory. 

The genius of 1830 is that these two dispirate elements (the spatial struggle for ideal board position and control of critical chokepoints and the stock market side which provides at least half of your money [read: victory points] at game's end), combined with a few other game mechanics like the market for locomotives and the disposition of the private companies all must be balanced and all affect one another, which makes a game that starts in the same position every time and has no luck element stay fresh and surprising with every replay. Unlike a lot of games with complex, multi-dimensional board positions, 1830 rewards an analytical approach without making that analysis a task beyond human comprehension.

I have no experience with the original Avalon Hill version, but the Mayfair edition is top notch despite the grumblings. The errata are trivially fixable and the components are beautiful, head and shoulders above the standard 18xx production. The revised "base" version of the rules is largely superfluous -- doesn't seem like a timesaver and it'll just confuse anyone reading the 30 years' worth of strategy writing on this game. This split between "base" and "classic" 1830 has an unfortunate effect on the rulebook, so you're better off learning from someone with experience or something like the How To Play Podcast.

1830 is a brilliant design, a compelling experience that will keep you interested for many years, and a landmark in game history. If you're at all interested in this sort of heavyweight economic boardgame, you owe it to yourself to at least give it a try.

10-04-13 - Played this game at BGG Con 2012.  It was a newb game.  I came in second after the teacher of the game who was well-experienced smashed us newbs under foot.  But, I had great fun.  I realized how much I enjoy 18xx, but as with so many of my games, finding opponents who enjoy it are few and far between.

Now I see what everyone is talking about.  Yes, this is a nasty game, and it's impossible to play it 'nice' and escape its nastiness. Does this make it inherently nastier than other nasty 18xx titles? Not so much, but this one does it very, very well.

An absolute classic, years ahead of its time. Hunt down either the Avalon Hill edition, or wait for the new one from Lookout (hopefully this will be well done, unlike the Mayfair one). If you are a boardgamer, you ought to play it. A masterpiece.

+ compelling, emergent gameplay
+ highly thematic
+ easy rules, once you get a game under your belt
+ phenomenal replay value
+ tight and restrictive, in terms of tiles, space etc
+ works very well with all player counts 3 and above 

= highly confrontational, you have been warned
= takes several hours to play, do yourself a favor and play with chips or spreadsheet
= more stock manipulation than train operation game

I really like the way the moving parts come together here. Yes, its a stock manipulation game...but there is a lot of room for clever play. I really enjoy watching the narrative unfold. 

Update: With more play...I'm really falling in love with the 18xx system. 1830 still stands as the king of the genre. What a brilliant game design! It requires a good block of time to play, and there is a learning curve as new players begin to understand how the stock manipulation works, but its well worth the investment of time and effort.

RATING: 8
Nasty and austere.

Really, there's not much I can say about this game that you can't read in the numerous other reviews here: this is one of the venerable grandparents of the family where you invest in public companies, build rail, and most importantly, make money, often via stock market shenanigans, which are front and centre in this entry in the series.

In comparison to many later games, this one lacks bells and whistles: there are some basic privates that have easy to deal with special powers, the track mix is fairly easy to deal with, and there aren't any special things going on at the end of the game. That said, there's also a certain value in having something that is so boiled down; the game is easier to teach and pick up, and fits into a manageable afternoon or long evening type of session. Of course, if this is your first 18XX period, the game will go longer, probably quite a bit longer simply because you will not be playing the game effectively and money will not come out of the bank as quickly. This is the main reason why I do not suggest this as a beginner game in a completely raw group, through having at half of the table familiar with the system is, I think, enough to tackle this one effectively.

Though recent state-based games in the system like 18AL basically copy 1830 in 2 hours or so less time, I think the grander sweep of full games like 1830 is part of the appeal to me: you need to plan not just for a few turns, but for the long, rust-encrusted haul and juggle multiple balls at once...always on the lookout for scheming opponents looking to dump your stock, or to leave you holding a gutted corporation.

As I said, I definitely like it. I definitely would like to play again, on almost any given evening. I owned an AH edition of this for a while when it was expensive, but I ultimately decided to sell it because of smaller scale worthy replacements (i.e.: 1889) that were available using a fraction of the selling price and fit my collection better. I'll probably pick up a copy of it again when the new edition rolls out, though I don't care much one way or the other if it's a new edition or another old one.

Aside: The PC version of the game isn't half-bad, but I'm surprised how many people advocate it on here. I think it's serviceable, but the interface is extremely clunky and it's difficult to see what the heck is going on most of the time. I couldn't imagine trying to play it hotseat because of what a PITA it is to access data that is usually easy to see at a glance in the real game.

I've only ever played the computer version. So don't put to much weight on this rating. I played the comp version many times and as I understand it, its a very faithful recreation. It only takes about 1/2 to 1 hour to play so that makes things so much easier. The long playing time and lack of committed opponents makes the board version hard to try especially with my true german gaming group. Anything over two hours for them is almost off limits.

There's almost nothing new to say about any 18XX, the dynamics and mechanics are well known. I love the absence of luck and the stock market system and this is a very nice edition of an all-time classic. Probably the only issue with this family of games is that they usually take very long to play, but that's never a problem for me. On the top of the list of favorites.

Players attempt to invest in companies, suck all of the profit out of them and leave them a empty shell. Timing this either with the end of the game or the opportunity to dump a bad situation on another player. The game alternates between rounds in which the players can alter their stock holdings (Stock Rounds, or SRs) and in which the railroad corporations invest in infrastructure and perform runs (Operating Rounds, or ORs).

In one way or another, good stock portfolio management is the main premise behind 18xx play. (Obviously, strengthening/weakening yours/your opponents' portfolios can be done in both SR and OR.) 

Beautiful in its simplicity. This one gets the 2D stock market just right in a very no frills way. ([i]Many other 18xx games manage to bastardize the stock market in some fashion, making the game less brutal to the detriment of the game.[/i] [i]Steam over Holland uses a 1D market that manages to do many of the same things[/i]) Very tight, no real room for error. The tile mix is fine.  As my first 18xx play this game sold me on the whole family of games.

EDIT: Having played several more games in the family, I've removed my objection to the tile-set's complexity. They just take getting used to. In fact, the tile set is better than in some games.

EDIT: fleshed out after plays of 18GA, 1861, and 1870. (And 1841, 2038, and Steam over Holland.)

I was finally, at long last, able to sit down at a table with 1830 on it, and give the game half a whirl. We couldn't play to completion (learning the game takes its toll), and while the teacher kept saying we hadn't even scratched the surface in that time, I think I'm going to respectfully disagree here. Oh, there's undoubtedly tons of ways to screw, threaten and cajole us newbies haven't even thought of yet. But what the game was [i]about[/i] was something we got a reasonable sense of. I'm not particularly sure where this game would end up, as I think it represents some sort of limit I'm not willing to cross when playing board games. The game becomes fiddly, and the bookkeeping is beginning to scream for a computer, something I've seen plagueing all Tresham games I've played to date. Also, even though the game isn't very unforgiving (upgrading track seems fairly easy, for example), there is the not-insignificant problem of long-term planning to be dealt with. If you find out you've made an irrecoverable mistake, you'll already have played about 3 to 4 hours, and that is not something I would like to happen on a regular basis. The long playing time also means that I'd rather play something else twice (or even thrice!). This means that playing 1830 will not happen on a regular basis, and that time invested to learn the game is effectively wasted.

In the end, I think 1830 made me realise more than any other game that I am not one for long, deep, strategic games which last beyond 3 hours. I am enough of a gamer to appreciate their design, scope and appeal, but the result isn't really for me. Tentative rating based on some generous extrapolation of my experience: 5. The game is cleverly constructed, but the length just kills it for me. If it were 50% shorter, then I would certainly play it more often, and probably up the rating too. But then it wouldn't be 1830 anymore, would it?

18XX is a series of train game about economic, and it has span out to it's own genre, separating from other games. While not the first game in line, 1830 clearly the trigger for the great many variants of 18XX family, a point of explosion in the history of train games. 

The game puts you in the position of rail barons, the investor in train industry. There is stock market mechanism that really captures the fluctuating price of shares, and not by random. When the corporations operates, it will be run by the president (who has most of the shares), but will pay (or maybe not) the dividend, giving the investors in those corporations more money to buy other shares. At the end, as all economic games, who has the most wealth wins. 

- An economical game about trains
- Simulates really well about stock market and price changes
- Quite realistic track making that gives satisfactory feeling at the end of the game.
- Simulates progression of technologies by the trains availability and special rules, making a progressive gameplay.
- Has many lots of opportunities for making clever play, either by stock manipulating or running the corporations. 
- No luck, all are player driven situations. 

There is a beauty in thinking and player interaction. This game sums it well, and I mean really well. From managing into speculating stock, into the decisions of running the company, and at last the subtle negotiations. Beautifully elegant.

The computer version of this game plays very similarly and it does so in Solitaire mode. It is DOS. Runs very well on my Win XP system using DOSBOX. There is a security check, you need the computer version game manual to key in passwords in order to play. I been playing it since the DOS days, Windows 3.1, 95, 98, XP. 

Plays fast with the system doing the scoring and determining which moves and stock bids are legal and overseeing the auction etc, less than 1 hour for complete game using all options and deseils etc.

Would prefer the box card and dice version if it did solitaire, but it don't.

Players are seeking to make the most money by buying and selling stock in various share companies located on eastern United States map. The stock manipulation aspect of the game is widely-regarded as one of the best. The board itself is actually a fairly abstract hexagonal system, with track tiles placed on top of the hexes. Plus each 18xx title adds new and different elements to the game. This game features private rail companies and an extremely vicious, 'robber baron' oriented stock market. A game is finished when the bank runs out of money or one player is forced to declare bankruptcy, and the player with the greatest personal holdings wins.

A great game. One of the greatest feelings in gaming is gutting a company in 1830, selling your stake in it and dumping it and its imminent financial crisis on one of your opponents (and now chairman of the company). A bit long when you first learn it, but with experienced players you can actually move this along at a good clip. This was the first "gamer's game" I ever played and holds a special place for me.

A tough game to get into - the mechanics are fairly straightforward, although there are some fiddly bits with regards to particular tile placing, however knowing what to do on a first (or second) play is intimidating - which are the good private companies and why, which are the best railroads and how much to float them at...get any of these wrong by much and you could easily spend the next 3 hours without much to do and being squashed by those more experienced.

But even when blundering through the game as a beginner you can see this is a classic game design for those with the patience to persist and put up with some of the maths - engages with it's theme brilliantly in a game of constant decision making and player interaction with no chance elements.

RATING: 9
Has a bit of everything...theme, strategy, tactics, skill, balance, replayability, bidding, stock market action. A gamers' game.  Highly recommend!  Had to downgrade it just a bit from a 10.  The paper money shuffle gets to be too much towards the end.  Definitely use poker chips.  Also it is a bit too heavy on the calculations (routes and dividends) in the last few turns.  It can leave players brain-dead by the end.  I used to think it was best with 4, but now believe 5 is even better.  The 5 player game is less symmetric in terms of corporation and stock certificate ownership.  There are still enough players w/more than 1 corporation.  So there are still plenty of the loot-n-dump shenanigans.  However, the players w/only 1 corporation allow a safer option of investing (assuming their trains aren't about to rust).  Still, a great game for 3-6 players.

1830 is a titan among economic games, serving as the inspiration for an entire class of games that have followed in its footsteps but have failed to exceed it. 

While it is longer than is palatable for many modern board gamers, 1830 packs quite a bit of game into that time period. Every single part of the game provides either a way to undermine your opponent's position while advancing your own or to force your opponents to advance both your position and their position at the same time. Combined it creates an entertaining game experience that is never quite the same and has never been completely replicated. 1889 probably comes the closest to it, and is in many ways almost as fulfilling as 1830.

I have actually sold my copy of 1830. Not that I think it is a bad game, but I think I appreciate 1889 a little bit more. I am going to get 1830 again once it is reprinted, but for now 1889 fills much the same role in a shorter time slot.

1830 is a genius design and an all-time classic, and my rating here only reflects my hesitation to play such a long game. It is very brittle and sudden powermoves can cripple other players in a hurry. 
 
There is a certain amount of groupthink here: you can help others fund their IPO's or leave them in the cold and boycott them. You can build track to help out others or to shut them out of big cities. You can hold onto shares or dump it and trash the long-term value of their shares. Negotiation / persuasion is definately a factor that people underestimate in these, and I'd prefer to keep it to a minimum myself.

Has a reputation for being nasty, unforgiving, and brutal.... but I wonder if that's just gamers glamorizing a design which is fundamentally fragile, unstable, hyper-sensitive, and borderline unfair.   There is a big discrepancy in the values of the private and public companies, and you can be completely shut-out by the turn order (Priority Deal).  You cannot control the PD, and really can't even completely manage it because it is impossible to rely on other players.   Thus, the rail-building element of the game is diminished and it largely is a game of gaming the timing.   Not my cup of tea.   I think I prefer the "softer" and more sandbox-y 18XX games.

This is one of the games that really got my brothers and I hooked on board gaming. The only negatives I have are that it takes a REALLY long time to play (5-6 hours), and there aren't enough $100 bills in the game. We always have way too many $500 bills and not enough $100 bills to make change. The version I have has much better components than the version my brother has - not sure which one was produced when.

After being introduced to the 18xx game system by playing Poseidon, it was now time to play 1830. And what an experience it is! Brutal, unforgiving and lots of fun.

Of course I have to play this again for better judgement but I like it already. However, the endgame seems to drag on a little, it's quite clear who's going to win a few rounds before the game is actually over. Nevertheless this is a solid 9 in my opinion. Time well spent.

great game with a lot of group control of the pace. the stock chart is dizzying at times, but the underlying concepts of the profitablity vs. the viability of a company adds strees to the puzzle on the route building phases.

RATING: 5
I have played this again after an interval of at least 20 years and it's still only a '5' for me.  There's too much focus on abusing the system.  I don't actually object to the fact that it's a mean game; I enjoy some mean games, including my second favorite game, Taj Mahal.  I just don't find that the way it plays out in practice leads to a game that I enjoy.  I have now played it at least 5 times, and none of those plays was enjoyable, though I recognize the value of striving to do well.

I used to think I didn't like 18XX, but I just didn't like 1830.  I love 1846 and 2038, and I really enjoy some of the other games in the series.  I tend to prefer games in which the main focus is succeeding in business, with an incidental focus on hindering your opponents.

I actualyl enjoy 30 with varaints more - it's not as tight a gmae, but I find the extra companies and expanded map board makes other companies a lot more interesting.

Notes from the one torture session of 1830 I suffered through, written during the downtime:

1830 - Long. Tedious. Downtime. 

A game without an entry point. Watching other people have fun. Gave up. Would have flipped table otherwise. Nothing makes sense. Track building is painful. I hate this and everything else it has spawned. I never want to play another tresham game. One of those few games that makes me seriously consider if I like board games. And obviously, I LOVE BOARD GAMES. But from where I am standing playing the game, I cannot see the light at the end of the tunnel. I cannot IMAGINE FUN. This game is a fun black hole. Fun cannot enter or escape. Is that how black holes work? I wish I knew more science. I wish I had an astronomy textbook to keep me occupied between turns. Somehow it gets longer and longer. I can't really imagine how turns get longer.

Did you know you can end the game early by going bankrupt? Also, did you know it is REALLY FUCKING HARD TO GO BANKRUPT, even if you try? Like victory, failure requires planning from the initial auction, and the rest of the game is just working hopelessly against the system, grinding toward the inevitable conclusion, making decisions that quite clearly have massive consequences, but whose consequences are not apparent. That's interesting in a morally ambiguous RPGS, but not in a forever-long board game.

This game makes me feel thick. It makes me understand a lot of things about non-gamers: the desire "not to think." Being overwhelmed by choices. Asking people what to do every turn. Recalculating everything every turn. JUST NOT GETTING IT. NEVER FEELING LIKE I'LL GET IT. The lack of hope is palpable.

I can do better, for sure. But that would involve starting a new company, and starting a new company means three additional operating rounds every turn, and I could be spending that time reading articles on my RSS feeds, or biting my nails, or napping. Or counting my blessings. I'm going to count my blessings.

The map looks nice. The iconography is fairly clear, except on the private companies, where nothing is written out. Apparently that's just the Mayfair edition, though, so I'm glad there are other editions. And other games. Even other train games that take the handful of interesting elements in this game and make them into games that are actually fun and playable. It eventually ends, I'm told. It could be sped up with spreadsheets, I'm told. Someone is here to tell me these things. Trains make fun noises, like "chop choo" and "chugga chugga" and "EEEEEEEE" and "kabloom," sometimes. This is way better than a legit train wreck.

This game can certainly be nasty, but paying attention and adopting a few simple preventative strategies can help you avoid this (like buying only one stock in a company that you are not operating).  Helps to play with people sensitive to novices the first play, but who are also experienced enough to give you advice on avoiding calamity.  The game length is from a different time, but the game keeps you surprisingly tense and engaged most of the game.  Love the ebb and flow of the company's stock over the course of the game and the eureka moment when you realize that a stock sell or buy, or floating a winner company could win you the game.

I still enjoy a lot of the "fun" elements added on to many other 18xx more, but 1830 is just tight and I think I'll always be coming back to it.   

I guess I'll include my overall thoughts on 18xx here as well.  I really enjoy myself when I play it.  There are a ton of different ways to play each game and you never know when the game will be turned on its head.  Probably one of my favorite things is how the last third or so of most games that don't end in bankruptcy, it's just time to see if a longer term strategy can catch up to the early leaders.  That's sort of the way I lean, so I always appreciate when a game really lets you explore that kind of play.  It's just always so tense when I can see the gap but don't know if I can quite make it up in time.

On the other hand, that last third, you're just doing nothing. Even if you run the game out on paper most times, is a big part of the system's problem.  It's just too long.  Is it too long for what you get?  I don't think so, but I just don't know if I need *that* level of depth in a game.  There are so many games coming out every year, and so many of my favorites that don't see enough play, I feel like there is still so much to explore.  Games like Planet Steam, Imperial, and Indonesia still fully satisfy my desire to explore new things and be creative and they do it in much less time with less risk of getting thrashed and having to play on many more hours even though you're out of the competition.

This is not to say I don't want to play 18xx from time to time to time, but it just doesn't seem like I'm truly going to suggest it that often until I'm old and crotchety and tire of anything but the most unforgiving of games out there.

[Stock Market Manipulation, Economic, Train/Rail] {6P:9, 5P:8, 4P:7} Deterministic, maddening, exhiliarating, scheming. 1830 is a quintessential asset manipulation game, going beyond the train game theme and into financial gymnastics. While it's all about buying stock in companies, and occasionally being a railroad operator, this game is about making the most money for yourself regardless of how your companies and trains do. Those who regard corporate ethics as sacrosanct will balk at the strategies and tactics one should use to his advantage, but in the end, the game is FUN. Every serious gamer should try this game at least twice. Highly recommended.

I enjoy the first 2/3 of the game, but the last 1/3 usually drags on for an hour too long. Probably because I know I can't win at that point. However, I still enjoy playing because for the next 1-2 weeks I can think about how the game may have played differently if I had done x and y instead of z.

====

My gaming over the past few years has lead inexorably to 1830, though my attempts to get into games were initially fraught with peril. Before finally playing with my game group I had lined up no less than three games of 1830 with various groups in the DC area, all of which fell through for various reasons. The gods were against me as my most promising game was derailed (hah!) by an epic snow-storm. In any case, it finally happened and took us around 6 hours to play and wow was it an amazing experience. The game's reputation as a no-holds-barred economic slugfest is true! I've since played a few matches against the old DOS computer version (thanks Russ!) and even got into another at a convention. Even though I may actually objectively like a couple of other 18XX games over 1830 (e.g. 1825, 1817), there is one huge advantage that 1830 has over them -- history. That is, part of the draw of games like Chess and Go to me is the fact that there exists a record of their matches, their strategies, and even their histories. Of all of the 18XX games, non can touch 1830 in that regard. I could spend years studying the game before exhausting its tangential depths -- never-mind its actual depth of play!

And, what's very important to me, I find it dripping with theme. You really feel like a stock exchange shark preying on those little railroad companies to gain the shark crown or something. The rules take a little time but it actually flows pretty well. Very good experience for my first try at an 18xx series game. Hope to play it more (and try 1861 that I bought but have yet to play).

[b]1830: Game of Railroads and Robber Barons[/b] [i]Francis Tresham 1986[/i]
1830 is a game of stocks and operations, that takes many hours to be completed and many games to be mastered, but it worths since the experience is fantastic if you like economic systems. There is absolutely no luck involved in this game, no dice, no cards, nothing, just your skill counts. A good idea to reduce its playing time is to use poker chits and a calculator, or even better some excel charts that are available for download in the game´s profile, since playing it with its paper money drags it out a lot. There are some other excellent entry games to the system, shorter and easier, so try them if 1830 is too heavy for you (Steam over Holland is my favourite one).

Personal: love the 18XX family, this one has easy rules for them but, probably, is one of the most aggressive. The stock market can become really cruel for players not used to it and can be out of the game in the middle of the game with a company with no future and no cash to revive it

While I like economic games in general, stock market manipulation is not what I consider as fun. I was therefore a little bit surprised that I liked 1830, but in hindsight I think there are a few reasons behind it. I have been longing to play more historical games. During the game, I did many mistakes, but I also realized after the game what mistakes I did and will play better the next time. I felt the end game to be a little long though.

Brilliant game, only its length prevents me from rating it higher. Multiple paths to victory, deep strategy, and a bit of history. Awkward to learn as it pushes you directly into a Bermuda Triangle of special rules and critical decisions in the first minute of your eight hour game ... but so what? They don't make them like this any more. Classic.

1830 is a very well designed and developed game, with no luck element (except seating order). It has stood the test of time, and spawned the 18xx series. I don't know that many current players of 18xx games realize the degree to which Bruce Shelley's development collaboration with Francis Tresham on this for AH moved the system from it's 1829 incarnation to a well tuned masterpiece.

(For several years Bruce and I were in a game club that played 1829 before he went to AH. But that's for a historical posting sometime...)

Mayfair edition is nice because they included many options and scenarios and expansions all in one box. Also there is a choice between an updated artwork or the mostly traditional version. The rules book also identifies the various interpretations of the rules that have evolved over time. This provides a great help in clarifying or resolving differences among folks who previously played in different groups.

RATING: 10
One of the best 18xx games IMHO.  Not much chrome here, just the plain 18xx mechanisms with a tough stock market and competitive track laying.  Good to learn 18xx although it has the typical playing time of 4-7 hours.  Everyone playing this should consider using Lemmis PC moderation program: http://18xx.de/download.html#1

Edit #1:
After 2 plays of the new, revised edition:
Raised rating from 9 to 10: The new, revised 1830 with the 1830+ ("plus") scenarios is as good as 18xx gets.  It fixes all the minor problems with 1830, namely that track building was more or less focused on the New York area and that certain companies (Canadian Pacific, Chesapeake & Ohio) were somehow sub-optimal.  The scenarios balance all this quite nicely, open up the entire board and make all companies more or less equally attractive.  I recommend to play scenario #2 which adds companies in the south (Norfolk & Western), in the west (Pere Marquette) and makes the company in the north (Canadian Pacfic) far more attractive.

Furthermore, the new edition has gorgeous up-to-date components, tick cardboard tiles and a double-sided map.


Edit #2:
For 1830 I'd recommend to switch to the new "Rails" moderation program ([url]http://rails.sourceforge.net/[/url]) which is, IMHO, much more user-friendly than the old software from "Lemmi".

Joc econòmic de compra-venta d'accions i de gestió de companyes ferroviaries. El tema està molt ben aconseguit, i la manera com es gestionen les companyes i la compra-venta d'accions també.

És bastant llarg, i és possible que els últims torns puguin resultar repetitius.. Hauré de fer més partides per comprobar-ho...

Actualització després de més partides: efectivament, els últims torns es tornen desesperantment repetitius i aborrits. Fins a aquest punt, el mercat d'accions m'encanta, i la fase de les accions de les companyes també. Altres problemes que li veig son que hi han pocs canvis de presidents de companyes i que el tema de la col·locació de losetes es fa pesat (haver de buscar la loseta que conecta el que vols, etc...). Tampoc m'acaba de convencer que les fases s'apliquin automàticament (perdua de trens, noves losetes, ingresos de localitzacions externes...), em sembla més elegant al estil del Power Grid, al final de fase s'apliquen tots els nous canvis...
Potser un altre joc de la mateixa serie i que elimines aquests defectes m'agradaria molt més, tot i que no se si existeix...

Amazingly good game with a ludicrous amount of depth and fascinating mechanics that unfold differently on every play. The game plays very differently with 3-5 as compared to 6 - some people like the strangeness 6 presents but I'm not sold on it and prefer 3-5.

I believe I have played this more than any other game of this length now and the longevity of it is truly astounding. Every game plays out differently and features a plethora of interesting, challenging, and game-changing decisions.

Finally got to play the "grand daddy" of the 18XX series. Sure, 1829 was the first, but I've never heard of it (or played it). :-) It is very similar in terms of rules and special exceptions to 18AL, so I was very comfortable playing this. I suppose at this point, it is a matter of personal taste as to which variant is the "best", but it is a pleasure to play a watershed design, and see how far the 18XX system has come. It is standard AH fare, where the components are definitely from another era, so I can appreciate the production values of the latter variants. This board seems more open and expansive than 18AL or 1870, plus there seems to be more interaction amongst the players being in the northeast. I am looking forward to playing it again, and this time for the length of the game (we had to cut the first game short).

Update (07/15/11) 2nd play: It seems the sweet spot is with 4 players. Played with 5, but there was too much downtime for some of the players, and not enough action due to the limited number of companies. Two of the players had only one company, so there was very little room to maneuver.

Business at its most basic and brutal. Make the most money by destroying others. Defraud stockholders, buy companies and then use them up leaving an empty shell for someone else to deal with. 1830 depicts the Robber Barons in all their glory. Yes, as Randy reminds me to mention, its a *train* game.

RATING: 9.8
I don’t know what people expect when they first play 18xx, but I expected absolutely baroque rules, a byzantine play sequence, and less emphasis on the board. I didn’t even know trains made runs on the board.

So I was pleased to find out that 1830 was less abstracted than I had anticipated, more pleased still to discover that ‘stock shenanigans’ in fact summarizes the core gameplay very well.

My first game (a solo play, broken off at 6 a.m.) I discovered the importance of setting appropriate IPO prices, and I got to watch some good and bad private company choices play out. I sat down for 20 minutes with 1830 on DOSbox, and when I finished with that I had straight what I’d got wrong in my solo play.

I have the original Avalon Hill edition, and I found the rules straightforward and clear enough. Some concepts seemed to be assumed that I had to puzzle out later, but I’m not sure it was so much that the rules were unclear as that I assumed things about how the game was going to work.

1830 itself? I regret the time I waited before sitting down and making myself learn 18xx. It’s a little long, and if you don’t have a handle on the economic engine it can even seem a little anticlimactic if you came in with expectations; but it’s a game I want to play and then play again. Just conceiving of a turn involving a private buyout, a train rush, and a stock dump makes me want to drag my wife out of bed to play 1830.

It amazed me how much of what I’ve read about 18xx was crystal clear after one solo half-play of 1830. It’s not as hard to learn as I assumed, nor as hard to play adequately as I guessed it would be; but it’s hard to play well, especially when others are playing well.

1830 is one of my least favourite 18xx titles. Reasons include:
a) Bankruptcy ends the game
b) Poison train(s) i.e. you can buy a train & never get to run it
c) You cannot play a portfolio game - buying more than one share in another player's company is an invitation to go bankrupt
d) Nurturing a company doesn't work - the robber barons will depress your price and rush your trains into obsolescence
e) The map - laying tiles and stations - is almost irrelevant. The game hinges on manipulating stock prices and buying the right trains
f) The game spends far too much time in the stock rounds and too little in operating rounds
g) The game is totally unforgiving to beginners playing with the sharks
h) With more than 4 players, not all can start a company at the beginning

I'm sure this game will always be the touchstone against which other 18xx's will be measured. Overall it has the best balance between route building/tokening, portfolio management/stock trashing, the train rush and timing of any 18xx I've played. And it all comes in a relatively simple ruleset. Prior experience at the game is rewarded big time as not all the companies are equally valuable by any means (try winning with the Canadian Pacific). There is a chaos element that you can't overcome (and more players=more chaos), you can be prevented from winning in spite of optimal play or at other times you can win without feeling that you did much to deserve it. At 5 hours, this has a very reasonable playing time for the number of options available. Looking forward to trying out the new 'scenarios' in 1830+.

The developers seem to have thrown every possible variant into the mix, including subtleties like variant tiles and N+m trains. What the effect of these will be is too early to tell, but there's enough packed into this box to keep buyers entertained for years. The main attraction for me, however, is the scenarios. So far Scenario D "A Level Playing Field" and Scenario G "No One expects the Canadian Pacific" seem the most interesting. I've long been banging on about the terrible weakness of the CPR, these ideas go a long way to making the companies more even. A good thing for game variety.

Ferroviario d'altri tempi, che provato in altri tempi mi avrebbe probabilmente convinto maggiormente.

Rating after one learning game.

Hmmm...I can see the promise in 1830, but I'm not sure I can commit the time to it that it needs.  The game I played had a few interesting moments, but it was surrounded by a lot of grinding and somewhat monotonous bookkeeping.  I'm sure repeated plays would make it much easier to execute the vicious and cutthroat play that this game is known for, but will I ever play it enough to get to that point?  Doubtful.  

UPDATE:  After playing ~5 rounds on the old PC version, I am starting to appreciate what 1830 has to offer. Automating the bookkeeping and train operations really makes this game fly, allowing the meat of the game to really shine through.  Though the PC version has some serious drawbacks (the map is basically illegible if you don't already know it which makes it next to impossible to be sneaky in your tile laying, the stocks move too quickly to keep track of and it's too cumbersome to see what your opponents' stock holdings are) it's still very enjoyable to play.  I just hope I can progress to a point where I'm not handed my ass every time (on Easiest no less).

What a strange occurrence that this classic title jump starts a genre about stock management of railroads. Definitely one of my favorite genres though!

That's a small gripe in an otherwise fantastically compelling system.

There's nothing about an 18xx game that provides me any form of enjoyment, and so the prospect of spending another three hours(at minimum) per session at least half a dozen more times just to progress past the conscious incompetence stage is unappealing.

2017-03: I'm coming around on 1830. There's a sharpness to it that I've not seen in many other 18xx games. There's some amount of scriptedness to some of the track and to which companies are better/worse than others, but there's also quite a lot of variability in there as well.

2014-08: I like 1830 and will play if it's the 18xx on offer, but I'd much rather play any of a number of others.

This was a really cool one, I was a bit nervous at first that I'd make a mistake and go bankrupt, since apparently this one is on the more aggressive side, but I played carefully and made sure to not do anything stupid, and I even got the opportunity to surprise everyone and really hurt another player's position. This actually made one company go down into the colored section of the stock board, which is another really cool thing about this one. If a company has a particularly low value there are some new rules for how its stocks are treated, which can lead to some really cool plays.

The most vicious of the 18xx games that I have.  There's definitely a stress on the "Robber Barons" part of the title. 1829 preceeded it, but it seems like most Americans started with this more widely distributed version.

Initial Rating: 6.5 (November 2014)

1830: Railways & Robber Barons has a big reputation and I wanted to play the game for a long time. I’m glad that now I have the friends to play long games like this one :D. When the game was explained to me, I was thinking that it wasn’t as hard as I thought it would be rules wise (easy to get rules), however it is certainly a heavy  game due to the long play time and the decisions are far from obvious. I didn’t know that the game was so old, so it was a tremendous game for 1986.

In a nutshell, I like the game, but it has some issues that prevents me from rating it higher. The game components are ok¡, the art is regular.
 
On the good side, I really like the market phase, choosing which company to start or to invest in is not a trivial decision. The operations phase is also very interesting at the beginning, but as the game progresses it becomes slower and slower so it began drags. Only the company presidents play this phase so other players can get bored. Fortunately all the players are very focused on the game so the time passage isn’t felt. Love that the game is virtually luckless.

On the bad side, the game has lots and lots of downtime, furthermore if you don’t operate any company. Even though I love long games, I feel the game is long just for the sake of being long. What I mean is that the game could easily be much shorter without losing the tension or the interesting decisions. Making the end condition that the bank is out of money seems very extravagant. Just tweaking with this variable should be enough to customize the playtime. I also don’t like much the fact that you can do very well without be the president of a company, this means you only play in the very short market phase and you sit out the very long operations phase and still win the game. When a player is the president of a company, it seems very hard to take that away from him, there are a very short amount of shares. Finally, I also feel the game can have a “rich get richer” issue as it is hard to catch up with the early leaders. I think the obsolescence of the locomotors help a lot in this regard.

Bottom line, I like the game system and I feel it has a lot of potential. I would love to play other games in the 18xx universe. My main concerns so far are the high downtime and the high (unnecessary) playtime but the positives far outweigh the negatives at this point. For now I won’t be buying the game but I’m keen on playing it again. It has a very good chance to get higher on my personal ratings.

Fantastic, fantastic game.  It's easy to see why 1830 is considered one of the gems of the 18XX series.  The game is not "balanced" in the way we commonly think of today,  which I mean as a compliment.  The variations in private companies, railroads, par values provide a robust decision space which allows the game to retain what seems like endless replayability despite an utter lack of randomness.

Certain tactics in the game can be vicious, but it seems like the only one that a player can't defend against is stock trashing.  I didn't see much of this in the FTF game I played, but it gets ponderous in the PC game.

RATING: 7
Only 1 play, rating may go up.  Played with experienced players -not a good idea; they helped as much as they could but I got a lot of knowing smiles as they set me up or I made some naive play.  Slight worry that the game may prove to be one for learning all the tricks of the trade rather than formulating an overall vision/strategy.  Continual counting of money started getting irritating especially when I had to use all my own money and sell most of my shares to buy a Diesel!!!  Hard to pick up the strategy after 1 play.
Well after 10+ years played again.  5 players, all relatively new to the game - much more enjoyable experience despite still going bankrupt from a winning position - at least I know where i went wrong.  Upped rating and quite keen to play again.

RATING: 9
I'm not sure what it is about this game that makes me rate it so high... it's a lot heavier than the games I usually enjoy.  It's still the best introduction to the 18xx series of games and it's more of a stock manipulation/money game than a railway operations game, so that's probably the reason I like it.  1830 provides a lot of flavour... just make sure that you put aside at least four hours to play.

basically the grandfather of all 18xx, very complex and interesting, amazing game.  the 18xx games are like 3 different interlocking games of track development, share trading, and timing purchases of trains.  the learning curve is enormous of course and the calculations are no doubt tedious so these games definitely aren't for everyone.
the new Mayfair 1830 edition has some errors and is perhaps more nice to look at rather than purely functional but I appreciate that quality, and I was able to get corrected tiles easily.

Having thought about the game a lot since I played for the first time a month ago I finally broke down and got a copy. Might not get the opportunity to play that often but really enjoyed it so worth having a copy. The misprints in the new edition are slightly annoying but didn't affect my enjoyment of it so would be a shame to pass on the game just because of that.

RATING: 5
I enjoy 18xx games from time to time, and this was the first one I bought and played.  Will not play it these days if other xx games are available, mainly because of the stock market manipulation aspects, which seem to introduce an artificial tactic into the game.  Usually the best strategy is to get to permanent (5) trains ASAP, but timing to get the 300 discount on the first diesel can be important but also too much of a tightrope-walking act for me.

It was a magnificent leap from 1829 to 1830 - like going from a low-budget flick to hollywood blockbuster.  This game set a standard against which I have measured so many others over the past 20+ years.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
18xx looks familiar and approachable on the surface: buy shares, manage companies, connect cities, upgrade track, upgrade trains, profit. Beneath this surface lies a game almost entirely about conniving and underhandedness. You claw your way to the top, interfering with the value of other players' stocks, dumping failing companies into their laps, buying up the only trains their companies can afford, and generally manipulating the raw forces of the game to pulverize them. What sets 18xx apart isn't the inherent meanness per se, but the fact that if you remove the shenanigans, there isn't much left to talk about. It's a rules-set designed for sudden, sharp, and unexpected plays.

So, where should you start if you're curious about 18xx? Well, you really ought to learn the system from an experienced player, and if that's not possible, I suggest going with Indonesia, which is a cousin to the system, incredibly deep, but also more accessible up front. If you can learn from a pro, 1830 seems perfectly doable. Certainly no more or less doable than any other lengthy iconic game (Die Macher, for example). 18GA slims things down a bit, but not to any noticeable benefit. I'd rather play more 1830 for a while before sampling the idiosyncrasies of its kin.

I should say that I have an unusually hard time seeing the possibilities while I'm playing an 18xx game. 

Update: Second play, and fifth or sixth play of the series. Definitely making a lot more sense. Seeing more to dig into. However. The train rush could end up feeling overbearing. A big part of 1830 is maneuvering so that when the Diesels enter the game, you are not kicked out of contention or into bankruptcy. Everyone plays knowing that the dam will break, and only a couple of players (?) will make it out of the way in time. 

[b]Rating Downgraded[/b]: Perhaps everyone is supposed to play with pen and paper and keep notes and role-play some kind of warrior-accountant, but I feel like oversight and clerical errors play far to big a role in the 18xx series. Is that a fair criticism? Maybe, maybe not. Consider the difference between writing and proofreading. In the former you concentrate on clear, distinct, well-crafted expression. In the latter your mind runs entirely passively and you hunt for error. I spend far too much of my time hunting for error in 18xx.

My third 18xx after Steam over Holland and 1856. Initial tendency is that I like 1856 better but 1830 is faster and has less special rules, i.e. less complexity. It bothers me that with experienced players it will be seldomly seen that somebody possesses more than a single share in a competitor's railroad. Newbies will learn this the hard way.

On a side note, use of a moderator makes 18xx games far more playable in an evening and hassle-free ("how much is 30% of 260?") but you should know what is happening. Otherwise, the moderator can make the game feel like playing an excel sheet and inexperienced players will have a hard time following.

With the release of the Mayfair second edition, this original Avalon Hill edition becomes a purchase for collectors only.  No need to sell your AH edition if you already have it and are comfortable with the game as is, but you are limited in your game experience in comparison to the new edition.

For 2-7 players, best with 4-5.

I especially like the fact this edition has multiple layers of the game for a range of experience from beginners to advanced.  This opens up the game to a wide audience.  The game's complexity can be tailored to the participants' wants.

route building / stock market 
this game has a lot of pieces that is the reason I rated it an 8 if you play it on the computer it is prob closer to a 9.
the reason I like this game is there is not much luck if you win you know how you won and the next game is never the same.

Although very long with a typical Avalon Hill rulebook this is quite literally a rewarding game. A good mix of building and stock market stuff but i suspect that it is best not played with the same people over and over again for the most fun.

*All Comments Based on Solo Play*

The only 18XX I've played.

I like the mix of different systems that influence each other. The minor companies, the trains, the track lays, the tokens, the stock prices, the priority deal. The curvilinear hexagonal track system is really cool, and leads to enchanting visuals later in the game. Overall it comes together to create a very interesting dynamic system. It is an incredibly well designed game in my opinion with interesting balancing factors placed in the layout. It does, however, have a lot of overhead for what is really a fairly abstract, competitive game with only minimally salient historical or narrative value. This makes it less appealing to me for solo play.

RATING: 6
I've only played the SimTex computer game, and the rating reflects my respect for the innovative and mostly robust design as well as my reservations about cardboard play. I've probably played the computer game many more times than most people could practically play face to face in a lifetime; this is not the same thing, of course, as there's some serious idiosyncrasy and bash-the-human going on with the bots, but in itself it illuminates the game's potential issues: total playing time, spending too much of that time staring at the board to work out optimal runs and waiting for others to do the same, and the non-negligible prospect of a bankruptcy ending. I would have expected the last especially to be a source of trepidation, even derision: a five-hour game that can abort after four and effectively spit out a winner at random could in fact be said to be broken. Obviously you can mitigate these things to some extent by computerizing the board element at the very least.

Tremendous game.  The down side is the length.  Doesn't quite fit into a weekday evening of gaming.  But with experienced hands we are picking up speed.  I figure this for about 4-5 hours anymore, depending on who and how many are playing.

I have a perfectly nice 1st edition.  I've played on the new edition, and found it had a couple negative attributes which pushed me into selling it in preference of playing on my 1st edition.  But the new edition is fine, and you should buy it if you don't already have this most excellent game!

This is a LONG game, no...seriously.  If its your first time playing you might want to dedicate 8 or so hours in which to complete it. 

We spent a bank holiday monday playing it, and it was my first time.  I wasnt overly interested in it when I looked at the box, but it did surprise me.  It was wonderfully well thought out, and it can be quite brutal too.  There are so many strategys you can go for, some obvious and for the slow but steady players, and some more fun and risky ones with your trains and stocks.  If you fuck up on the stock market you really wont recover easily during the rest of the game.

One of my favorites, hands down. This is truly epic and keeps you on your toes the entire day it takes to play this game. No randomness makes this a clear winner. The downside is of course the 10-12 hours playtime which isn't a bad thing but makes it quite hard to find gaming buddies :-)

My first 18XX and taught myself. Though it will take time to learn it, it is well worth the effort if you like games with stocks, trains, negotiation, and my favorite genre-
cutthroat. This game is ahead of it's time. Print off some of the lovely player aids on this site. And well your first, second game may be a little rough but once you get the hang of it, you're playing a masterpiece. 18XX is definitely a niche market, but if you can find players interested you're in for a treat. Looking forward to trying other titles in the genre.

played it about 60 times, never gets old. Our house rule is we always play 4 person 1830 classic from 13:00 to 18:30, when at 18:30 alarm goes off, and if the game is in an OR we play until the next SR, and if the game is in a SR phase, we play another 3 OR.

-2 because compared to other games this one just takes too long. The bank never goes bust. The stock market, the train obsolescence, the hex availability and replacing with more advanced all make for a perfect game.

There is a Conventions page somewhere on the internet that all players would have to sign to so you are clear on all the little corner cases, we did, and refer to it each time. 

Comparing to 1856, 1830 is simpler, 1856 with the Canadian government thing and the loans and harbors, feels too contrived so we always prefer 1830.

Reprint 2010 by Mayfair. Absolute must have
They better keep the stocksystem the same otherwise it would be a 6. I absolutely love the brutalness of the stock


If only....

Well only downside to this game is the playing time.

If I was able to play this more I'm sure we can finish a game in under 4 hours. Now we took 5 hours to see my attempt to bankrupt the host of the evening backfire and that action cost me 1310 of my personal cash.
Because the game would last now another two hours we decide to cash in our stock after finishing the operating round.

James beat me by a two hundred or so. But after each round things could change dramatically. and the cost of my action was 1300 remember.

I had 80 % share of B & O and 60% share of another company and 40 % share in the company where I had to buy another Diesel for That stock was evaluated at 175. I would have been able to buy three out of five of th remaining stock in the bank pool for that company unloading some stock that was valuated at 100.
Not sure if anyone is allowed to have a hundred percent share because I could push it to three fifty rather quick (two rounds equals 6 operating rounds and i had a train running)

as I see it the stock market overvaluates stock and you as a player have to pick a time to burst the bubble and cash in.  If you decide to hang on to the dream you'll be able to cah in at the end of the game if the bubble bursted at a high price. So one should not be to greedy cashing in and wait very long IMO as we did. Companies went at 250 and 275 a share. Which makes it worthwhile to keep them around the 200 mark.

got the 999 games reprint but apparently there are more than 20 mistakes in the reprint...

The "basic" game of the 1830 branch of xx holds so many little intricacies to learn and master, that despite wanting to try out as many xx's as possible, I feel I would probably at the moment be just as happy trying to only perfect my skills in '30. I usually rate games only based on "how much/often do I feel like playing this", but I'm feeling the need to give 1830 a +1 as a honorary mention of opening the floodgates for all that is 18xx.

An updated version of the Avalon Hill version.  The map is dual-sided.  One side is conceptually identical to the AH map, with only the artwork changing.  The other side includes a few variants and some tweaking to make what were weak railroads in the AH version stronger.

Also includes dual-sided tiles.  One side identical to the AH tiles and intended for the AH side of the map.  The other has updated artwork and a greater range of tiles such as the #5 and #6 tiles, which greatly changes gameplay on an 1830 map.

18xx are railroad wargames with financial themes.  I like the ideas and mechanics of this and several 18xx games, but I find the gameplay not very fulfilling.  The learning curve is too high for my preferences as there's a lot of screw-your-neighbor nuances to learn or watch out for.  I just simply don't have the inclination to invest all that time into 18xx to get decently good at it.  I prefer Age of Steam as a railroad game much, much more.

My first ever 18xx gaming experience was an interesting one and definitely makes me more interested in trying more of them out if time and players are available.  Doesn't hurt that I won!  There's definitely a lot more options available in playing the stock market than we took advantage of in this game but with 3 newbies, we were mostly interested in trying to develop "our" companies and not play the market nearly as much.  The track play wasn't too vicious either, but I see possibilities for making life rough on opponents if I play this again.  I'd definitely make a different opening move as well in future plays as I got off to a pretty slow start initially due to a poor decision where I fell $3 short of being able to start a railway on the first turn.

RATING: 7
Wow. I really admire this game and would rate it higher if not for the length. I love the combination of stock market manipulation and track laying.  The playing time is definitely edging towards my upper limit although I could see the game going significantly more quickly with more experienced players than I have experienced so far. I have also played and enjoyed the shorter game variant ($4500 in bank and no diesel trains).  It cuts the time nearly in half and still offered a very satisfying game to me.  Played the original version again recently and was really disappointed in the grind that the endgame became.

All my plays were online. It's probably quite early to say so, but at the moment it seems less interesting than 1856 and 1846 (with the latter having the great advantage of being playable in a regular game night). I guess I can only understand the appeal of those market shenanigans oriented 18XXs when I play one in person. I'm always up for an online game, especially because it is pretty clear I'll need many many plays to start playing reasonably well, and I guess there are many things  I can learn with 1830 that may be useful in other 18XXs I prefer.

I got the new edition of game in bundle with 1865 Sardinia. Till now I haven’t tried it but my expertise on the previous version make me confident to give an evaluation just upon looking at the content and the booklet.
My opinion is that Mayfair has made a good work. The game is beautiful in each of his component and also the introduction of variants makes it possible to try different gaming approach. I’ve loved 1830 since is mi first railroading game and I like also the cruelty that some strategy consent: dumping and downgrading share values are my preferred activity. I give a good vote reserving to change it upon playing.

RATING: 10
This game has high level of tension, Many decisions to make and most likely you'll make a mistake during the game. One of the better designs to date...
I like the stock market aspect of the game. Trying to make your company very efficient and then dumping it with nothing left!

This game is pretty much about pure economy with a hint of 'connection' to go with it (nothing significantly spacial). This is another 'longer' game but the play's the thing and this game has some serious play. I don't think I've ever played 2 games that were even remotely the same.

The new Mayfair Edition is excellent with lots of extra tiles for the various variants that have been developed over the years.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.6
An astoundingly nasty game (a plus, if you’re in the mood for it).  And it’s a very clever design.

But it’s unforgiving to new players, since it rewards a close analysis of the board and a good familiarity with the train buying sequence.  This can be compounded by the market, since a player familiar with the game will likely provide investors a better return on investment.  And it takes a long time to play.

A great, classic train game. There is a reasonably steep learning curve even for experienced gamers as it is an old AH title.  You are looking at game times of 4-7 hours unless you play will folks who are very experienced with 18XX.  I really like this game but it is hard to find folks willing to play games this long.  

The new Mayfair edition has some introductory games without the Stock Market to help newbies.  

If you like complex, train games with a stock market element and no luck, this is the game to play.  This is not a game you play with your 8 year old kid.

Played once, and that is barely enough to scratch the surface of a game like this.
But I enjoyed my play, there are a lot of strategic and tactical possibilities within a relatively simple rules framework (the framework is relatively simple, but of course there are a ton of exceptions and one-off rules).
The end game (last hour out of six) was rather dull though: when all stocks are held by players and nobody wants to sell anymore, you're all just going through the motions of runnng the trains and emptying the bank.
Would love to play again because I think there's a lot more to discover in this game.

An unforgiving game in which an experienced player will beat a novice just about every time - also extremely long and slows down at the end just when the players are usually beginning to run out of energy.

I have owned this since not long after its release in the mid-1980s.  There is a lot to like about the game:  I like the mechanics of buying stock and floating the railroad corporations, and the mechanics of laying track, placing tokens, and the increasing level of complexity that that involves.  So I enjoy a lot of the play of the game.  The reason I rate it as a 4 ("it doesn't get me but I could be talked into it on occasion") is that I find the lack of transparency about who is winning, and how long is left in the game, to be things that take away the sort of tension I look for in a multi-player game.  I want to know who is winning, and how much ground I need to make up in what time period.  I also think that it can be the case that the shape of the game solidifies quite a long time before the end, so that a reasonable proportion of the end game feels like processing rather than competing.  On the plus side, my nine year old daugther loves it - because of the aforementioned attractive mechanics, even though we tend to play it for the experience rather than to the end.

Plays well PBEM using a Java-based programme called (really) "Rails".
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Wonderful game of planning & timing. Full possibility of creative play, rich thematic ambiance, and steep learning curve - you should know each private company's worth, each stock company's specific character, flow of whole game, what your opponent can do to screw you, how train rusting impacts on each railroad.

It do have some flaws : An early mistake can virtually kick you out, it is hard to catch the leader, and late game comes repetitive. But because the game is so rich and pleasing to play, I don't mind them much.

Large portion of playtime seems to come from managing game money. I expect PC moderator could cut it down.

(Having no opponent to play, I've played only on PC. I'm logging only FTF plays.)

Much meaner than 1825 but far more direct. Less about running trains and more about financial shenanigans. 

I like it more the more I have played it. 1830 has a unique feel within the family. It is razor sharp, which is neither good nor bad -- it just makes daring play all the more daring. It also makes it harder for new players, who are liable to have their companies blow up in their faces.

Played it once. An acquired taste, I suppose. The stock machinations are more of game than the tile placement is, and a tricky/unforgiving one at that. It&#039;s a game that rewards repeat play. I know it&#039;s for others, but it&#039;s not for me.

A neat game - includes building track by tile-laying and a stock market in which players can invest in railroad companies run by other players. There is absolutely no luck - no dice, no events, no random generators of any kind. I'd rate this a 10 but for its length and for the problem of the 'poisoned 4.' Essentially the game cannot progress until the last 4 speed train is purchased, but there is little strategic reason for doing so. This can lead the game to bogging down for a few rounds until someone finally bites.

An excellent game for 3 to 6 players. There is no luck (except the players starting order) and it is a good game to develop your tactics and strategy. Although a bit long, guarantee you will have a great time. I love the possibility of playing both in the stock and the terrain...

Wow, after one play I am impressed, but it is unforgiving.  I made an early, beginner's error, and it really cost me, and, unfortunately, also my fellow players, so we didn't get to really experience some of the stock market manipulations the game promises.  Next time, I certainly will play better!

Dec '17:  I finally won this game!  Went for controlling 2 companies, bid high early on B&O.  Made some enormous routes and got by with my 4+4 train, while the 'down South' route earned the big bucks with the route, although its stock was worthless.  Great game despite two major spills: coffee and beer, neither by me.

My 18xx experience is limited, with only about 15 plays to this date. I was taught the format by playing 1830 and I'd say that it does that job beautifully. I think that the existence of several fairly obvious track builds (or at least small sets of choices from which to pick) help take pressure off of that aspect.
The stock trading and the initiative tricks are not that clear to me yet. Similarly, I'm not that comfortable with ruining companies that I cannot dump.
Nevertheless, this game has hooked me to the family. I am sufficiently comfortable to play, but there is still plenty to explore.

Update:
Using Lemmi's moderator program in dosbox is a nice way for soloing and testing some "strategies" or poking at some bad decisions made in a FtF game. Otherwise, just handling all the money and shares would quickly become too much.

The other 18xx titles in my collection are certainly appealing (1856 and 1846 especially) but there is something to be said for just knowing all the rules. Also, the other players, having less 1830 exposure, might be less happy with learning a new variant.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
This is the actual version that I learned 18xx on. It's not necessarily more beautiful than the new Mayfair edition, but I have some kind of nostalgia for it (discounting the fact that I only learned the game about three years ago).

I'd say that usability of this version is better, cause there are no double-sided components that are used for different things. Similarly, I need not sort out stuff that would be needed for other variants. (Then again, this version does not have the materials needed for the latter.)

Update:
Usability becomes less of an issue when using computer support. Via Lemmi's 18xx program, all you need is the map, the tiles, and the station markers. It is a shame not to use all the components but it is such a reduction in boring overhead (distributing dividents and counting money, in particular).

I appreciate the depth of the game but there is just too much (time) at stake and the impact of a skill divide is too great.

RATING: 10
The greatest of all the 18XX railroad games, and one of the best multiplayer strategy games ever designed. No luck factor or randomness whatsoever. Can be classified as an Empire building simulation that combines elements of finance, stock manipulation, track laying, route building, and the effects of rapidly changing technology. In addition, players can fully express their &quot;Robber Baron&quot; tendencies by raiding corporations and laying the remains onto someone else.

RATING: 10
The first game system (or game for that matter) I have ever rated as a 10.  My group has been meeting monthly for 8+ hour games sessions for years, tending to play the same game for 2-3 sessions in a row, then moving on.  18xx has been at our table now for 20 months in a row, and I expect it will be for many more months to come. These games are insanely addictive.  

18xx in general offers a fantastic amount of decision space for a relatively simple rule set.  It offers a healthy dose of screwage ability, while not succumbing to the gang-up potential present in most multi-player games.  The physical aspects of track laying and station placement, coupled with plethora of financial manipulations/decisions in the game, offers the largest variety of meaningful decisions I've ever seen in any game.  

1830/1830+ offers a cut throat stock market aspect, and much of the game is had here.  1830 consists of a tight tile set (i.e. limited track options), which can make for an unforgivable game if an early mistake is made.  1830+ is really a compilation of all of the variants made over the years.  It offers a much wider variety of tiles, making the game potentially more forgiving, but also offering much more strategies.  1830+ also offers up to 4 more RR companies, so one's money has more places to go, so getting a company dumped on you is potentially less likely.  Using 1830+ rules/components is pretty much like playing a different game.  While 1830/+ is an older game, it is as entertaining as any 18xx I have played.  I would recommend the Mayfair version, as it comes with the 1830+ option, and fantastic components (the track tile material is by far the best I have ever seen).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A good game, because 18xx games are good. This one's not my favourite, though. The tile mix is awfully limited (what do you mean I have to run straight through towns?), the dit towns are horrifying and the component quality is not up to  current standards (everything else is fine, but I'd like proper cards and better tokens).

But sure, it's a good game and I'd like to play more to figure it out better. I do prefer 1825, though - I like the way better performance leads to swiftly raising market value and the way small towns can be upgraded to cities.

Suggest.

RATING: 8
Just finished my first game.  I've only played 18AL before this and it was several years ago.  Played the new 2011 Mayfair edition and it is beautiful.  I want to hang the board on my wall as a work of art.  

I'm a little disappointed to hear (and see) that there were several mistakes made to the board itself.  It's hard to understand how these things happen so commonly, but at least Mayfair has been quick to correct the errors with tiles to cover over the mistakes.  

I came in last out of 5, although there were 3 of us within several hundred dollars of each other.  There were a lot of little rules I don't quite have a handle on yet but all in all I can tell it is a wonderful, deep game that I think I need to have for myself.  How often I will get to play it is a good question but it doesn't matter.  This is a great game and I want to take some time to delve into this game and possibly others in the series.  Obviously I have room for improvement and the allure of learning how to play well, or at least better, is what draws me to this game.  It's a little long (at about 6 hours for us) but it was fun and not boring and most of us were new to the game anyway. If it were a little more accessible, or shorter and therefore more playable, I would rate it higher, but as it is, I expect that my rating may go up.  I expect the game should be shorter after experience and 4 hours, give or take an hour, is not really so bad for a game of this depth.  I can appreciate why this series is lauded by so many.

There's actually a very good game mechanism buried in the 18xx games. I found this out by playing the AH computer game version of 1830 (and I would still be playing this, if it wasn't broken under recent versions of Windows ... if anyone knows how to get it working under XP, please let me know!). What stands in the way of the 18xx games being more mainstream is length and complexity of the record keeping. (And that's why it worked so well as a computer version.)

Fantastic game, though it does take too long for me to play it often anymore.  This one has staying power, though- when my kids are in college and I retire, I plan to buy an engineer hat and overalls and then find other geeky railroad nuts to play this with for hours on end.  When I'm not building a toy train empire in my basement, that is.  (Okay, forget the goofy outfit and the toy train empire- I'll just play this.)

I found a copy of 1830 for $11 in a novelty store.  Best value/cost ratio I've ever found.  1830 was my introduction to the wonderful line of 18xx games.  The strategies for this game are endless.

Build a business through route expansion and avoiding technological obsolescenc, manipulate (and be manipulated in) the stock market, negotiation and screwage - this game has it all. And best of all, no dice! The Reading variant is excellent but the Coalfields variant is awful because it takes all the tension out of the game. 1830 is hard on newbies but worth the investment in time spent on learning strategies and tactics. Early mistakes are difficult to repair, which always puts newbies off. The PC version makes a a very good trainer and reduces the game duration down to less than 60 minutes! The face-to-face board game version is quite long, with the last few turns dragging out as players try to squeeze the last bits of income out of their diesel trains. Suffers from a small runaway leader problem.

RATING: 8
It was the idea of manipulating stock markets to enrich yourself in a completely luck-free environment that drew me into the 18XX genre. Of the many games, 1830 Railways & Robber Barons is often considered the best in this respect. So how does it deliver?

Well, the first thing to bear in mind is that 1830 has a high learning threshold. The rules are not always intuitive and the gameplay is fiddly compared to modern games. And when you do know the rules, you have to understand which track tiles fit where and how they can be upgraded to avoid choking yourself, not to mention the critical decisions about when to upgrade to which trains and when to buy and sell shares to avoid being stuck with a worthless railroad.

But for the player prepared for this agony, 1830 promises a fierce gameplay full of negotiations and backstabbing. Although precise return on investment calculations will help you, your fate is determined by the other players and you must know when to treat them as partners and when to treat them as competitors.

I don't expect to ever master 1830 but I do expect to have a lot of fun on the way.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I enjoy the general concept of this game - the stockmarket interactions are fun and in particular I enjoy trying to be the 'baron' in this game.  However, the proportion between game length and interesting decisions is not appropriate.  The end-game is largely spent trying to maximize your train routes which is more a lesson in arithmetic than actual decision making.  Plus, if you are running away because you have the best companies there's not much others can do.

BGG user clearclaw has good advice on everything 18xx.

Strategy Guide: 
[q="clearclaw"]Surprisingly sound:  http://18xx.net/1830/1830c.htm

Which is not to say that it is without some glaring flaws (eg just flat out ignore all the silliness about starting companies for high pars early).[/q]

----

[q="clearclaw"]In '20, my current project, I use [i]open cry[/i] auctions extensively.  In short: any player may bid any value at any time, with ties broken by priority.  The result is that auctions are sprightly: rapidly seeking to approximate value with little wasted time.  However some players find the lack of player turn order...unsettlingly anarchic.

It may also be worth noting that the resolution auction among bidders for a private in 1830 is often done, not as a strictly ordered sequence of bids, but as an open cry auction (this area is one of the many undefined gaps in the AH rules).[/q]

----

[q="clearclaw"]And now I argue with myself: While it is clearly worthwhile getting the Avalon Hill edition, the Mayfair edition is not so greviously terrible that it should keep you away from the game.  It is just...irritating...and often.  But it is readily available and that's worth something.

If you do get the Mayfair edition, three things to make that process better:

1) Discard everything other than the bits needed for the "Classic" game until you're at least a dozen plays into 1830.  Just pretend they don't exist.

2) Do not use the side of the track tiles with the fancy art, use the side with the simple line art.  In the early days this won't make sense and the inconsistency with the map will be annoying.  Stay with the simple line art anyways.

3) Don't bother with the Mayfair rulebook outside of identifying what components to ignore.  Use the Avalon Hill rules, [filepage=131517]such as the copy I posted[/filepage].

And no matter which edition you end up using, read [url=http://www.18xx.net/1830/1830f.htm]Steve Thomas' article on rules ambiguities[/url].[/q]

It's definitly a good game, but it's not for everybody:
-> Very mean; whenever a player controls 2 companies, it's quite easy for him to attack other players. The only 100% safe to prevent this is to hold only 1 title of companies not controlled by you; but this will make you unable to win; and there are many other ways to attack players
-> Snowball effect; it's not definitive, because players can be targeted by a dumping or simply do not invest wisely, but chances are neither or those will happen to any player smart enough to take an early lead
-> The end phase drags a lot; 
+) calculating the best routes for each company takes a lot of time
+) planning what tile to take can also take a lot of time; there are many possible choices
-> The game takes a lot of time; you need to play relatively fast to finish it in 5 hours.

I guess all of the above will be less of a problem (or not a problem at all) for expert players, but becoming expert in such a long game requires investing way too much time.

I would rate it as a 8-9 if it were shorter.

Still, trying it out is a great experience that I recommend to everybody, at least once.

Uno dei migliori ferroviari che abbia mai provato. Piazzamento tessere binario e viaggi dei treni occupano solo un minimo aspetto delle dinamiche del gioco. I meccanismi dell'asta, delle azioni, le scalate alle compagnie e i dividendi risultato avvincenti e coinvolgenti. Il gioco simula anche l'evoluzione dei modelli di treni, da quelli più storici fino ad arrivare al treno diesel. Un gioco completo, con molta interazione, zero fortuna, che ripercorre le tappe salienti dell'evoluzione ferroviaria nel nord-est degli Stati Uniti. I principali difetti che gli si possono imputare (soggettivi) solo la durata complessiva e la complessità (specie per nuovi giocatori) del regolamento. Personalmente invece ci giocherei sempre!

Because the 18xx games have such a devoted following I jumped at the chance to play one. Fortunately our game had one experienced player to lead us through. Like ASL, I can't imagine learning this from the manual. I loved this game but I can't tell you why. To describe it, 1830 sounds like a snooze-fest but the strategies are so deep that it was entirely engaging. Our three-hour game (we didn't finish) flew by. I cannot wait to play this again. I'd give it a 10 but I'm not yet ready to put it on par to my favorite Advanced Squad Leader (not that they are in any way comparable.
Edited - I've had a couple opportunities to play this since my initial plays but have passed on them. Not one I have a strong desire to go back to now. Down-rated from 9 to 7.

What can we say? It's the grandaddy of all 18xx series. It is very well done and its stock market mechanics work very well. If we want to find some problems, these are due to its age:
- it can end 3 turns earlier simply tripling the income of the last round
- materials are poor
- you need a lot of experience to try to be competitive.

Another great 18XX game. This one I found a little less cut throat and easier to teach. But the intricacies are still tough for a new player. Stock price is a huge part of your ending value, but the trains can go very fast, so the choice of withholding vs paying dividends is a tough one. There are less track options then some of the other games in the genre. The end turns get long, mainly due to the number of companies and routes being taken and the negotiation between players. Lots of interaction and team work.

Not my favorite, but I have a lot of respect for it and would keep on playing.  Specifically, I don't like the odd tileset. 0-0 tiles, B tiles, double town tiles to make the game more about specialized geography than I like.  I prefer the shorter games based on this system like 1889 and any of the Mark Derrick games.

Comments: Alright, well I still haven't gotten a full game of it in yet, but I have been playing a lot of 18xx over the last few months. 1830 seems like easy mode to learn and teach after playing much more complex versions. The only hard part to teach is the brown/yellow companies and the private auctions at the beginning. Worried this game may take "too long" for many of the players and be "too mathy". I rather enjoy it, but I can see how it's not for everyone. I'd really like to play this one more, but it seems like it's too vicious for older 18xx players and too uninviting for non train gamers. Bah, I just want to play it.

An excellent game. Complex economic game that requires planning and timing. Poor decisions can be quite harmful, and there's ample opportunity to screw other players. The money-poor environment keeps things tense and interesting throughout. One of the great masterpieces in gaming. I have the Avalon Hill edition and the Mayfair edition but only play with the Avalon Hill edition.

A difficult game where you have to make many hard and potentially devastating moves. I only played once and was chrushed by more experienced players. 1830 really had a strong theme despite the slightly dull board and components. 

Rating will probably change with more plays. I'm absolutley not lukewarm about 1830, but my feelings about it are still in flux. With more plays I think that I will either start hating or loving this game.

RATING: 8
Very restricted tileset and high number of station markers for blocking makes it feel more of a chess-like game than economic sandbox that I want an 18xx game to be.

Edit: variants are much more interesting..

Pretty much a day-long game (although in theory you can play it in less time I doubt anyone would have time for enjoying it!).  Entirely skill-based with absolutely no element of luck once the initial turn order has been determined.  Creating and running the railroads is fun and a very necessary part of the game, but the winning and losing is done on the stock market.  Lovely game and rightfully a classic.  I'm always surprised when the board turns out to be so small; I habitually remember it as a lot larger than it really is...

Bit of a heavy game for most and not a game you can relax in for one minute. Keeps you on your toes all the time. Best played with a good banker to keep the speed up. 5 players is optimum IMO as everyone can make the choice to have their own company at the start. With 4 each player has too much influence and almost forces you to play the game completely on the edge of going bankrupt, more often than not a quick game. With 6 too much is out of your hands, unless you like the cooperation in starting up a company.

It's my number 1 game. Combination of the game mechanics, the intensity of it, the memories and the cut-throat environment. Can really imagine yourself being a railroad tycoon, trying to outwit your competitors with the next dirty trick!

[floatleft][ImageID=573603][/floatleft]Avalon Hill's implementation of the 18xx system based on [thing=1823][/thing]. This is the grand-daddy of the entire financial prediction and stock market manipulation branch of 18xx games. 1830 was something amazing when it came out and it influenced the entire 18xx system. I have to commend Avalon Hill for being so incredibly ahead of its time. 1830 is an incredible game that started a 18xx movement. 18xx is extremely deep.

My 18xx experience is limited. I've so far only played 1846 twice. Since I loved that game, i've been really excite to give other 18xx games a try. 1830 is the other game I've seen recommended to beginners. We also made sure to play the Avalon Hill version, since I've seen people didn't like changes to the game that were made by the Mayfair edition, although I don't personally know what those changes were.

We setup to play at about 12:30/1pm, and the game ended at 10pm. The game started out fantastic, but once we hit the 7:00 point, the stock market element of the game stopped doing interesting things, as all the stocks were pretty much settled with their owners, and it felt like the game was just about to end. Then it went on for another three hours.

We did mess up one major rule, thanks to no help from the rulebook nor the player aid I printed out on BGG. The rule we missed is that if a company doesn't payout to the players, then it's stock needs to decrease, even on the first turn where it's not allowed to operate, because it has to buy a train. The rulebook passage, multiple players read multiple times, but we thought that this might just have been one of the differences between editions, or a difference between 1830 and 1846, but in fact towards the end of the game when things were feeling ridiculous, I did some bgg rules searches and found the answer. The really frustrating thing was I even printed out these nice player aids that only said the stock goes down if the company runs and keeps the payout for itself, and goes up if the company pays out. No mention of what happens if the company can't run because it has no train.

This brings me to the other issue I had. Twice in the game, a player sold off all the trains their company had, and then had turn order on me for stock selling, so they were able to dump their stock, leaving me with control of the company, and leaving me on the hook to buy the company a new train out of my own money. I guess that's the point of the game, and I was ready for it to happen once, but it happened twice, and really, once would have been enough to take me out of ever being able to win.

I'm conflicted about this game, because while I felt like it was far too long, I'm not sure I got the best sense of it because of our rules error. I liked a number of things about this game over 1846. I liked the small town rules, I liked the three dimensional stock market. I kind of want to give this game another chance, but really what I'd like is to play a shorter length 18xx game that brings these elements with it.

This game having three operating rounds, and infinite distance trains really drags down the time between turns.

Absolute classic 18xx. Can play friendly with friendly players for mutual gains or bloody with sharks for mutual stabs in the back. Either way, it plays suprisingly fast for an 18xx and despite the diesals allowing runs of infinite length, the limited track prevents analysis paralysis in the late game (or at least it keeps it managable).

First 6-player game. Looks like at least an 8 but I played it like a 7..... Not too much screwage in our game but knowledge clearly was power. Being ready for the forced train upgrades and having routes to travel on with the better trains are obviously essential. End game went on an hour too long but maybe there an be a better way to handle the repetition.

2nd play with 3-players. I've learned a lot about 18xx since my 1st play. Excellent game with a tight tile-set. I might need to rerate all the 18xx game up to 9.

A good 18xx game, but it can be very vicious and players can be badly hit.  Takes a very long time to play.

Newcomers to 18xx are advised to try 1825 Unit 2 before having a go at 1830.

In the last 1830 game I played I was badly hit by having a train-less company dumped on me, and so got some way behind the other players.  (However, I engineered an action that made myself bankrupt so as to end the game in half the normal time!)

The 18xx series has some staunch fans, looking for the perfect plan. 
There are several aspects I enjoy - the engineering to optimize a route. The share manipulation, which in 1830 is vicious. 
The early and mid games are the most interesting, as you jockey for position, force or avoid the train rush, trash peoples stock....

RATING: N/A
This one is a classic, and I don't throw terms like that around lightly. It is a monumental achievement in gaming, and it would be just as influential if it were released today. It seems to exist totally outside of the development of boardgames  in general, and that's a major selling point of the 18xx system for me: they are so unique, and 1830 is where that uniqueness really started, as the Avalon Hill development took it away from the route-building focus of 1829, the only other extent 18xx at the time of 1830's release. This gave rise to the Nasty 2D Stock Market. 

To me this is [i]the[/i] baseline 18xx game, and I internalize the rules to other 18xx games based on how they deviate from 1830. But 1830 provides one of my favorite things in gaming, writ large: the rulebook simply frames what the players are allowed to do on their turns, and everything is up to them to see how it plays out. 

Once you and your group know what you're doing, this is 4 hours and lasts 7 Operating Rounds. But the game plays out differently every time, which is no small feat considering it's a fixed setup. And I love how that's possible, how small changes in the early part of the game have major ramifications later. 

My opinion of 1830 is not uniformly positive, though. I still can't decide how I feel about how there are clear differences in the strength of companies (so the early and late companies are pretty much always the same), and I think Priority Deal is too important to have it come down to "I'm sitting next to the stock-trashing guy, so I always go first" kind of thing; I definitely prefer how PD moves in other games (18NEB, for one), which seems to offer more control and introduce another manageable decision.

Any game that allows you to make tons of money has an inherent aspect of fun.  The heart of the game is buying and selling stock.  The railroad aspect in no way provides for players to pick up and deliver goods.  Rather it is there as an alternative way of modifying share value (as opposed to buying and selling stock).  Suffers slightly from having too many rules that add thematic flavor, while taking away from game play.  I fear that with experience the first half of the game may get fairly scripted.  Wouldn't mind playing again if that's what the group wanted.

Not a game to play lightly as at least 6 hours are needed to complete a game. However if you have a day to spare and you wish to expand your horizons to a very deep and elegant game, then this is worth the effort. It is not difficult to play and you will not be out of your depth in your first game. Essentially a share buying and route building game there are many opportunities to undermine your opponents so careful planning and watchful play are required.

The upside:
-This is my favorite 18xx. It comes with all the sweat, blood and tears, and only just that. There's nothing here that does not contribute to perfection.
-I absolutely love what you can do companies you don't control on the stock rounds, and I love even more what you can do the ones you control.
-The operational aspect of this games tends to be more interesting when it's about trains than when it's about tiles. With that said, the way that trains can disappear in this game put David Copperfield to shame. And you know what? Toying with my emotions like 1830 does should be definitive sign of excellence.

The downside:
-Maybe it's one of those games who can only shine with players with similar experience on it.

[OPO] An initial auction round to kickoff the game.Then players alternate operations rounds and *stock* rounds (company shares are bought and sold through a stock market mechanism) rather than further auctions. Operating owners can buy and place railroad hexes with specific rails from a limited supply, purchase trains, and pick-up and dliver goods. Great economic game with simple enough rules to be a good intro to 18xx.

I've played the 18XX games a few times and always found them fiddly, over-complicated things. Essentially players invest in and develop railroads, a theme explored in so many other games - but with more complex rules and a lot of mental arithmetic. I think this is one of those older games that if streamlined and rewritten to improve the play experience while reducing the complexity would be a really great game.

18xx are great games. This is the grand daddy. Maybe not the best, but still worth a 10. There's no explaining why this game is so great, bc there is no comparing to other games. Takes up to 4 to 6 hours, even with an experienced gaming group (when no prior experience with this game, and even then..), no luck factor, just your basic economic sense, diplomacy, long term planning ability, people skills, long term planning analysis and knowing when to back stab and when it is *possible* to trust. And of course some hard core 'passing the initiative so the other guy has to take the crap' :p

RATING: 8.5
(+) Amazingly satisfying stock market game
(+) No luck dependence
(+) Different phases during play: playing this game feels like playing 3 different games at once - in a good way
(+) Tense timing, lots of exciting possibilities
(+) Structured flow of the game

(-) The game takes a tremendous amount of time to play. Our first game took us about 10 hours! This is mainly due to inefficiënt waste of time in bookkeeping (handling paper money, finding the most profitable routes in increasingly complex networks, finding matching puzzle pieces, ...). With some scrap paper, poker chips to replace the money or maybe a (tablet?) computer to assist with this kind of bookkeeping, the game might speed up considerably.
(-) The game starts out really tense and keeps this tension up until about 2/3rd of the game when engines need to get replaced. The final third of the game also has its unexpected moments, excitement and surprises, but an important part then boils down to standard network building/optimalisation and repeating certain actions in order to run the bank out. The game seems to end up in a less 'dynamic' flow compared to its start and middle-game.
(-) Game material is unhandy: some cards which are removed from the game re-enter it because the back of the card is reused for some other purpose. This makes setting the game up and clean-up a real pain.

[u]Tips:[/u]
(*) The final 3 operation rounds, it is well possible to get $5.000 out of the bank. Those final operation rounds are actually rather dry and dull as most tiles have already been placed. This makes a rather dull finale to an otherwile excellent game. For a shorter game which doesn't have this problem, I would suggest to take $ 7.500 out of the bank before starting the game (playing with $ 4.500 in stead of $ 12.000 - it looks like a dramatic decrease in play time, but it is not as the vast amounts of money only come flowing into the game when the higher trains come into play).
(*) Use the app 'Survey Party' (or something similar) to leave calculating optimal routes to the computer/tablet. This will strip off a considerable amount of time, certainly near the end of the game when networks become complex

Approx playtime: without means to speed up gameplay (such as scrap paper, electronic assistant, poker chips, calculator, ...): 2 - 2,5 hours / player

This was my first 18xx game.  Has the virtue of being relatively short.  The cutthroat nature of it is interesting too.  Downgraded to a 9 because given a choice of 1830 and 1835, I would always take 1835.

rating after 1 play (3pl 7hrs) - 6

some v interesting bits with the share and company management BUT am not keen on the railroad building bit and the route optimisation is VERY annoying - the last hour of the game is just abuot doing maths and counting out money

also there just arent enuff trains for the companies and the decay algorithm is so harsh it becomes farcical

i would love something similar that took ~4 hrs and simplified the track element - please let me know if u know of such a game :)

This is a game unlike any other, except, of course, the other games in the 18xx series. It is heavy and long, requiring patience, stamina and the ability to focus for hours at a time. It is one of my favorites although finding a few other players with a block of hours to commit to one game is perhaps the hardest part. If you are comfortable with running numbers through your head for hours at a time, then give this game a shot. The goal of the game is not to finish with the most money, it is to finish with more wealth than everyone else. There are so many ways to achieve this, no two games will play out the same. Be warned that your typical opponent will have an IQ somewhere around one million.

I believe I am destined to suck at this game. We shall see on Saturday.

Yep, I do. I can only hope the simulation value of this game as it applies to real life is poor, or else I am destined to be a day late and a dollar short. 

It flows better and is more fun than I expected given the tedious rules and subject matter. I'd be willing to play shorter versions of this game. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Amazingly great, as you would hope, and the time investment (4 hours, with poker chips) seems about right. There are only about ten pages of rules, so it's not as difficult to learn as the 18xx reputation suggests. (It's not as hard to fathom as, say, Bonaparte at Marengo).

The DOS game is quite good too.

Why is it awesome, one might ask? Mostly because it's a simple game system that supports a huge range of playing styles and strategies. And you've got to admire Tresham for not taking the easy way out and using a random setup.... this is a proper strategy game with opening lines, tesuji, tempo etc. Give it a try if you like heavy abstracts and / or wargames.

1830 is, in my opinion, the best of the series, both as an introductory game, and as a game for veterans. It's pretty low on simulation and high on game.

The print and play Reading expansion adds a lot to this game, if you've played the basic version to death.

Update: Enjoying it more the more I play. The tile screwage is rough.

Update: becoming increasingly addicted to this game and to 18xx in general. Promoted to 10 rating.

Long playing, but worth it.  The key to this game is to disguise your intentions, because that is the only "unkown" - there is no luck(randomness?) in the game.  If there is something an oppenent can do to screw-up your plans, he probably knows it and will soon do it - so keep your options open or screw him up first! A well orchestrated share dump is a thing of beauty.

The game which brought the very popular "18xx franchise" to a wider audience after the earlier designs featuring UK rails (1829). Along with his other design masterpiece, Civilization, the  brilliant Francis Tresham did so much to move boardgaming away from the Monopoly era and convert it into a more adult hobby. A design classic.

This one was something of a letdown.  While I seem to play 18xx a lot different from most of the folks out there, I expected to like this one a little more than I did.  As it turns out, it was extremely painful to play, slow to develop, and had an agonizing end-game.  It just really did not seem to stand up to several others of the series that I have played (1825, 1870, Steam over Holland).  Despite the rating, I really do hope to play again and expect to pick up a copy at some point in the future if I am able.  It just wasn't what I expected given how highly this is esteemed among the 18xx crowd.  [06/28/2009]

Played the game for my 3rd time this evening. Loving it! We are playing the "equal opportunities" scenario (D) with 2 extra railroads. The veteran player says about it that - although would not prefer this scenario - he certainly agrees with what it does for newbie players. It helps keeping everyone involved in one way or another.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I played this a lot back in the early/mid 1990s.  Mostly quit playing after 1856 and 1870 were published.  More recent games have left 1830 in the dust and I extremely rarely play it since the  newer games are so vastly superior in every way.  The excessive focus on looting companies, buying and then dumping shares to destroy share value, etc takes the game away from being a true economic investment game and turns it more into a economic war game.  That is fine of course if that is what you are in to, but it downplays much of the rest of the features of 18XX games that make them so interesting to play.

The failure of 1830 is that the game is built around very tight 'edges' where one small mistake by a player can result in huge gains for another.  I prefer games that are won via many good decisions rather than being constructed around one or two critical decisions.

Anyway, the game popularized the 18XX genre of games and for that I acknowledge it as very important, but the hobby has long since moved on.  New players should start with 1846 or maybe 18MEX.

Watched it played 3 times, read the rules, bought a good condition used copy. Cannibalized it for parts for other games, gave away the rest.

1830 is a vicious game of stocks and train routes. One of the better games in the 18xx family. 

A good mix of short-term and long-term investments, turn order manipulation, stock manipulation, cutthroat tactics, blocking, and really squeezing out every last dollar to get or stay ahead. It's not just what you do but when you do it and who you do it to.   
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I have played the game twice now, and find that I am really enjoying exploring the game! I like the stock market manipulation as it is provides a different twist than any of the other train games that I have played up until this point. 

Both of the games have been with 3 players. After 2 games I feel that we have a good enough understanding of the rules that we can begin to focus on how to make those rules work in our favor. For the next game, strategy will definitely be a big focus. 

Train rusting is an interesting mechanism for advancing the game, and timing when to buy trains seems to be a big deal. 

At this point each of the companies seems to have their own little area to work in and will interact with the same couple of railroads. Time will tell if this is a bad thing or not. I could see the game becoming stale to some due to the nature of the company interactions, but it is probably far to early for me to be able to tell.

Mayfair is apparently going to offer replacement parts for the errors found on the board and tiles. Hopefully, this will mean that the errors can be mostly a non-issue for me. It may still cost the game a bit simply due to the hassle, but I am not sure it is that big of a deal. During our two plays, nobody seemed to mind too much.

Talán a leghosszabb játék eddig, amivel játszottam. 2 órás szabályismertetés után 7,5 órás játékidő 5 játékossal. Ezért már elég brutális dolgot kell felmutatnia egy játéknak. Nos, ha objektív szeretnék maradni, akkor félig-meddig sikerült is az 1830-nak ez. A játék nagyon komoly, vasúttársaságokban szerzünk részvényeket és építjük az amerikai vasutat. A fő részvényesek döntenek a társaságok terjeszkedéséről és vonatairól. Osztalékot oszthatnak (amivel növelhetik a részvények értékét) vagy minden üzemeltetésért járó pénzt visszaforgathatnak a társaságba (amivel csökkentik a részvények értékét). Tulajdonképpen a részvények és társaságok jó menedzseléséről szól a játék. A játék végefeltétele a pénztár teljes kiürítése, ez rettentő sok idő, mert a társaságokat nem könnyű beindítani a nehézkes terjeszkedés, vágányépítések miatt. A játék végén már csak osztalékfizetésből áll egy-egy kör és nagyon unalmassá és számolóssá válik a játék ez nem túl szerencsés. Jó játék-e az 1830? Igen, főleg, akik szeretik a részvényes játékokat. Megéri-e a 7,5 órát? Részemről nem. Nehéz pontoznom emiatt, objektíven ez egy erős játék, szubjektíven viszont nagyon lepontoznám, mert nem igazán az én világom. A végső pontszámot ennek figyelembevételével tessék megítélni.

Shows its age in some relatively fiddly mechanical aspects (such as the repeated, fatiguing evaluation of the dividends) and requires substantial commitment (and time!), but will reward the willing gamer with a unique, grand experience. No system I came across captures the spirit of financial capitalism this well, with that elemental simplicity which is the hallmark of Tresham's designs. This system so deserves its strong retinue of followers.

Given the amount of accurate resources that may be found on the web, the sloppiness of Mayfair edition had me puzzled. All the same, the resources mentioned above and the errata countersheet that comes with recent prints make it a very worthy, and pleasant to see, product.

I'm a fan of the 18XX system, so liking this is no surprise.  Comparing 1830 to others in the series, the money is tight, likely if you are buying privates, you can't float a corporation right off the bat. With only eight corporations to investment in, the companies find themselves battered.   You constantly have to torque your portfolio to get ahead, it behooves you to drop a company into the yellow to buy more stock.  The market is very loose, and while that may put off people, there are other 18xx games for that.  If you want two companies, you have to get to it early, it is easy to get behind the curve and get stuck with only one.  The train rush can be a real bitch if you don't plan for the ones you need disappearing or hope that the next upgrades don't happen (rusting/losing privates).  All in all I love it, and would be more than happy to play it anytime I have time.

It's not that this is bad, but it's just that it's WAY too long for what it is. There is an interesting startup phase where you're deciding which companies to acquire and when, as well as establishing some routes, but it seems that then you're just playing things out. I guess that the bankruptcy element is to add some interest here, but I'm just not sure that this is my kind of game.

Our first game took about 8 hours. Awesome game though, I especially prefer 1830's stock market to 18EU. We also hope to be able to finish the private auction faster than the minor auction in 18EU and thus speeding up the game. Poker chips are in use!

If you asked me which 18xx game I want to play right now, I'd prefer 1830 over 18EU.

I only rate it an 8 because it takes too long to play and if you don't run any company it has too much downtime, especially when there are 2/3 operation rounds before each stock round.

Considering the economic simulation and how everything works together in 1830 this is far better than just an 8. I could probably (maybe even should) rate it better than this but the ratio fun/time of play, which is by far the most important thing a game can have, is not very positive.

I would like to play this game now and then, maybe a couple of times a year but I think it will be very difficult to convince my gaming friends to do it. The sad thing is that I'm sure that everybody, with a couple of games more, would like this game a lot!

My gaming group is not very fancy about 18xx games and that doesn't help me playing this kind of games more often. I wish I had that possibility. The thing is that this is a very particular type of game with a unique brilliant economic engine. This engine works perfectly no matter how players play and that's why is so common to newbie players get bankrupt. This is a gamers game and without any doubt one of the greatest games of all time!

UPDATE
I'm now in a phase that time of play doesn't matter much as long as you're making things. 1830 and 18xx in general are becoming my favorites so I can now state that 1830 is such a terrific game that it should be in my top 10!

This could go either up or down based on more than the one play I have and exposure to additional 18XX titles. My concern is that there seems to be companies you MUST start with based on how the board develops. Of course, you can challenge yourself by building in a different area and seeing what happens.

2/15/18 UPDATE: Got in three more plays of this yesterday. It was great to do that back to back, by the third game I was getting compliments on some of the moves I was making by the pros I was playing with. Man do I have a loooong way to go to be competitive in this game but I am up to the challenge.

In the past I had some amount of disdain for 18xx games.  I think it comes from watching the train gamers for years at GenCon.  They would play their games pushing money around all weekend and it seemed they would never leave their corner of the convention center.   Walking into that part of the hall was like entering a foreign country.   So for years no, decades, I stayed away from 18xx.  Then the new version of 1830 comes out and a freind buys it.  I figured, why not try a play.  And I have been thinking of that one play ever since.  The funny thing is, for the preeminent train game, the trains are almost the least part.  This is truly a stock game and a game of the harshest realities of buying and selling stock, aging trains and cut-off routes.  It is brutal and it knows it.  There are points in the game where it tries fairly hard to bankrupt a player....and it is awesome.

My first experience with the classic 18xx-title was a nice surprise. I expected to be more intimidated, but a few earlier experiences with other 18xx games and Baltimore & Ohio were enough to play the game with a minimum of rules explanation.

The game has some unique dynimics. Even when you think all companies have settled and seem safe, a minor action may suddenly shake up everything and have players scramble to dump dangerous stocks and acquire safer ones.

I would like to play more, but the playing time of about 6 hours precludes this from hitting the table often. It's just too long to play on an evening (for me anyway)

I wouldn't use 1830 to introduce someone to boardgaming, but it's good for experienced players.  The optimum number of players is 4-5--fewer than that and the stock-market skulduggery loses force, and with 6 players it's too hard to get going.

For me, they are okay games ... and a bit too long.  I would rather play something else.  I know I'm going against the grain on this game.  For me, it's just personal taste.

A very nice and very cruel economic game.
It gives you the chance to act like a shark and after ruining a company to give it to another player who happened to have shares in it.

Unfortunately the first 2 times we played it with most of the rules wrong.

Also the length of a session is about 5 or 6 hours so i don't expect to play it again soon.

Really great game. I believe this is the best of the 18xx series.  I would play this any chance I got, which is admittedly not very often given the time commitment. I still think about games I played over a month ago.  The "NO LUCK" and "PERFECT INFORMATION" factors are some of my favorite elements.

I used to play the old AH game on computer, and loved it. This Mayfair redo is a decidely mixed bag. 

First, this is not a good rulebook - it's a poorly organized smattering of rules, variants, dense sidebars, and a lack of attention to detail. Discounting the soap opera commentary, the examples can be very helpful.

Second, the game looks very good. But still, there are boneheaded production issues (e.g., the new tile numbering, the tiles being too small for the hexes, trains on the back of trains, etc.).

Third, there is a lot of variety here (including a scenario to somewhat match the old AH game). Not sure of the quality of these variants, however.

Fourth, the impression here is that Mayfair was rather careless and that there are multiple poor decisions (new tile numbering, why?) rendered throughout.

When all is said and done though, this is still a truly great game - one of the most compelling and intriguing titles that I've ever played! (rating is for the design, not for Mayfair)

18xx game. I find them too repetitive and mathy for little gain. Trying to eek out every dollar by calculating the most optimal run is just tiring, not fun. Wish there was some hidden information or randomness to spice the game up. Also, the games typically last way too long for what they are. Wish they were more streamlined, less mathy, and more about manipulating the stock market. Basically Chicago Express with a little bit more.

Believe it or not, but this was my first, fully fledged 18xx game. I had played things like [thing=4098][/thing], [thing=43307][/thing] and [thing=76417][/thing] though.
We played with 4, all of which had played either 1830 or Poseidon before. The game took 9 hours to complete. We weren't bored, but that is very, very long. And it's not like we were playing slow, but this is a long game. Now, I can see this game taking as little as 4 hours with experienced players. But that is still very long. It is a deep, fulfilling game, which might justify that length for some, but I get almost the exact same satisfaction from playing Poseidon or Age of Steam, and those games take 2 hours or so. So why play a game that takes twice as long? I wouldn't refuse to play 1830 again, I enjoyed it, it is a very good design. But it doesn't offer as much bang per hour.

Initial rating: 7.2/10

A longer comment is warranted. For now, let me say this. After numerous plays, I still have many unanswered questions about strategy and tactical stock manipulations that I want to explore.

This is a big classic game that has spawned a whole genre.  It's a stock market game, with plenty of ways to affect the market.  Company ownership, blocking, track-laying, and buying and selling are all important.  It has a longish time frame, but must be played many times to get a handle on all the moving parts.  That generally is hard to accomplish these days.

I had this ordered from coolstuffinc.com once, then I cancelled my order. I really wanted to have it, but after looking into it further, I realized that getting it to the table would be far from a reality for me. My family likes much lighter games. But lately I've gotten to know a group of players who like heavier economic games, so I think it might be a possibility again. 

However, I'm going to go with a friendlier 18xx game for starting out: 1846. I've got a copy coming to me very soon from a friend. If I like 1846, this will be the next logical step.

All time classic. As I hate capitalism, games which rely on money as motive I find hard to truly love. But it does actually give you a great insight into the ruthless nature of capitalism and the fact that running trains is secondary to making money. 18xx are great games just not my cup of tea.

This one was a beast to learn.  As it's an older AH game it really dragged on too. A lot of down time.  Wasn't too miserable of a game to play, it did create some fun in me but not enough that I'd want to try it again...I'd rather play Rail Baron.

UPDATE: So yeah. I've played a lot of train games by this point and I can honestly say...I don't like train games. You know the ones that are considered "real" train games like how grognards think about "real" wargames. I mean I like Ticket to Ride once in awhile but these 6 hours monstrosities that are a series of repetitious counting and recounting...ugh just shoot me in the head...I'm good with that. I'm not lowering 1830's rating to a 1 or anything but it does rightly deserve the 2 I gave it.

Too far at the accountancy end of the 18xx scale, too aggressive, and often too set in stone in terms of what the "right" strategies are.

I wouldn't turn it down - it's still 18xx! - but I can't really think of a situation where I'd choose this over another 18xx I like better.

Played long ago, the only 18xx game I've tried so far, but want to play more.  I used to play the PC DOS version also.  Still, it's hard to find players for such a long and cut-throat affair.  As for railroad themed games we usually play Age of Steam with tons of expansions, and others like Wabash Cannonball and Pampas Railroads and Railroad Dice are getting some play. Also want to try Stephenson's Rocket and Dampfross. 7/12/09 - I just reread the rules to 1830 and I'm ready to play!

Got to play again, 3 player with Francie and Brian. Took 9 hours. I Presided over only 2 Companies, and got hit hard when the first 5 train was bought. I ended up playing great but came in 3rd by a small margin. So glad to have played it again!

I've only played the PC version, haven't yet found the players and time to play face to face.  But what a game!  Like Civilization, it evokes so much theme and challenging play through its intricate play structure.  It doesn't resort to randomizer components and randomizer charts to create atmosphere and challenging play.  Like Civilization, 1830 is still light years ahead of most Eurogames in how it recreates its theme through the use of play structure and relatively simple or clean rules.

The first and, arguably, the best of this "branch" of the 18xx games (the loot your first company to set up your second company branch).

Play can get a bit stereotyped and the diesels can make for endless track laying for tiny effects in the end game, but the possibilities of winning by bankruptcy or playing a successful "backgame" (by running some companies into the yellow to generate extra shares and diesels for your other companies) keep 1830 more interesting than most of its later imitators.

One of the better games for learning the 18xx system.

Great strategic game with lots of room for different strategies and tactics. When playing, you really feel like there are many roads to victory, and playing the game more often really makes it better (games with veteran players are usually highly competitive). Because of the long playing time, however, it is still not a game for everyone. And it is really necessary to have your first play with a couple of people who played it before, because the rulebook definitely is a pain to read.

I was always skeptical that this was worth the cost. But I lucked into a copy at a bargain price, and I must admit it really is a great game, even worth the eBay prices it usually commands. The learning curve is brutal - you can read and understand the relatively simple rules, but you'll have absolutely no idea of what's important in the game until you see it in action (almost always on the losing end of things the first time). And the no-chance nature of the game along with the long playing time makes for some grueling training sessions for newbies. The availability of the old PC game can help there at least - I would highly recommend playing a few games on that before sitting down to a real game.

That being said, if you can get past that investment there's a fantastic game here. There are tough choices to be made from beginning to end. Vicious surprises lurk around every corner. And winning strategies are subtle and varied - no game ever seems to play out quite like those before it. I find this last point to be notably true even in the computer version, which of course can't compare to what you'll see face-to-face. Terrific game - I'd play it any time.

The abandonware DOS version is probably the only computer port which I prefer to the original (I've played both with AI and hotseat).  The implementation is very faithful, calculation time is slashed, and the random maps are a fun bonus.

I tried to prepare in bringing this to my gaming group, though I knew it would probably be too much. I played the old PC version and learned the rules as best I could. But we couldn't even complete the training scenario, abandoning it 2.5 hours in. The B&M player was at that point hemmed in (due to misinterpreting future track layout in New York) and declared he never wanted to see the game again. Our main problem was the tracks. How do you plan while accounting for X number of possible track changes that could leave your plans high and dry? Track tiles were inspected incessantly, and AP flourished.

With the group not being on board, I traded this away, but I still believe it is a very good game with more experience and a dedicated group.

My introduction to 18xx. Very good game of stocks, business and screwing over your business partners. Only real downside is that due to the tile-mix allowing building of complex crossings etc. and tight map layout on the east coast the route calculation towards the end of the game is hell. More plays of this has reveled that this game can be played a lot, it feels as if I'm still just beginning to explore the possibilities and strategies.

A classic, no doubt. But a lot has happened in game rules and mechanics since it has come out. While it's still fun and challenging, the endgame is really a drag. Just running trains and calculating income.

The one that started it all (or at least make it popular), this is a true classic railroad game.  There's no luck involved and it can run a bit long but the rules are straight forward for an AH game that's now over 20 years old.

Finally getting around to playing this classic. Lots of choices, great interaction extremely rich game experience. Everyone should at least try this one. Warning! It takes quite a few games to understand what the best options are.
(but it's worth the effort).

One of the railroad titles I do like. I'd rate it higher except I really DO prefer wargames. The stock trading and robber baron aspect really works quite well as both a game and a lesson in how the stock scams worked prior to regulatory processes.

A classic 18xx. This took a few plays before getting all the nuances down. A very rewarding game for those that love finance chaos. The volatile stock market is what, in my opinion makes the game.

Advice: Don't play this with an experienced player who tells you exactly what to do every turn.

In other news, don't hammer any nails into your forehead.  That's also not as fun as it sounds, it turns out.

1830 is probably my favorite at the moment, but only because it is the one I currently have the most experience with. It represents the 1830 branch of the 18xx games that I love (18AL, 1856, 1861, 1870).

Start a company sell the company. repeat.  See how many times you can do it on every turn.  Watch someone go bankrupt.  Most aggressive of the 18xx and still the best.

I don't care for the par value mechanic. This one is very bare bones and being fairly new to 18XX and playing this one with experts every week really shows me how this one has been "Solved" in a way. Most routes are predetermined, the NYNH is the best, the campac never works, so on and so on.

RATING: 8
Features a really restrictive set of tracks compared to other 18xx.  I am uncertain if that is better or worse, only that it is different, and as a result, sort of shift the focus away from the tile laying.  Granted the initial placement of tracks is still important, however, I found myself spending less time in trying to optimize my runs and more in the market manipulation.

Unfortunately, we made the mistake of giving out dividends to the company for shares left in the IPO rather than in the pool.  So there was too much money floating around which caused trains to be bought too quickly.  Despite that, I am interested in trying 1830 again because I imagine the game would have played vastly different.

this game is a myth. You start building railroad and you finish with a calculator to know your income and to buy the best company on the stockmarket.
Very realistic simulation. The only fatal thing could be the sequence of players around the table.

1830 a classic amongst classic tabletop board games.  The game is most famous for its near total concentration on market manipulation and fiscal assault, but you'll likely lose if these are your only concerns.  The game is Francis Tresham's baby, but the game almost didn't exist but for a herculean development effort by Bruce Shelley at Avalon Hill.  Indeed, in Shelley's seminal article on the development of 1830 in the pages of The General he discusses the fact that the game was built on Tresham's original substrate that was quite 1829 in nature.  It was during development that some features of the original prototype were relaxed (share availability ordering, no orange nor brown stock market regions, no PRR bypass, fixed par values) while others were constrained (e.g. private sell price) to find a balance that proved legendary.  1830 is often criticized because of the (perceived) incongruities in its tile set and its the map and the (again perceived) scripted builds that can result.  It is my opinion that the constraints in tiles and map actually bring a lot to the table in the sense that Stravinsky meant when he stated:

  > The more constraints one 
  > imposes, the more 
  > one frees one's self.
  > -- Igor Stravinsky

The game itself melts away and all that remains are the players at the table.  It allows the ultimate opportunity for flexibility and devilry in play within the confines of the game (and should never exceed such).  This is similar to the way that Poker plays out time after time, year after year with the same group of players.  When the game finally gets out of the way all that's left are the players and all of their habits, foibles, and biases.  It's the player who can work past these biases that will win 1830 more than not.  Imagine an early stock market "scene."  A handful of gentlemen would gather at a locale with a hand-written roster of the day's available stocks and their prices.  These men knew each other well because they met in these same places day after day.  That is, these men knew each others' habits, their foibles, and their biases.  Operating in such an environment at such high stakes must have taxed each man's resolve and stretched each man's intellectual capacity and imagination to its limit, but time and again the cream rose to the top and the most brilliant (and conniving) minds reaped their just due.

Play with no fewer than 4, ever, jump at the chance for 6 whenever possible as the opportunities for stabbing with a smile are plentiful and bankruptcy and 4-train disappointments are assurances.  On the other hand, the 2p game is something to try at least a few times in life.  The Avalon Hill ("Classic" in the Mayfair edition) rules are the only way to experience this game with perhaps an occasional tincture of The Reading and Coalfields splashed for occasional flavor.

Comprehensive intro into the realm of the leading stock holding games series - complete and accessible package, also great for railways lovers. Very long, playable in 2, but makes the game fiddlier, since you have to manage 3 or more companies to be competent. It can drag for hours Monopoly-style if you don't adjust the bank portfolio accordingly. Production value in Mayfair edition is very good when compared to 18xx standards, yet not great. Ultimately requests dedication almost close to the HIS standards, which is too much since HIS is hell of a lot better game. Yet I am keeping this "oldie-goldie" for those moments when economics fever hits me hard.

After 1 Play: My second stab at 18xx, and most likely my last.  I can see why some others like this, but it just isn't for me.  At heart it is much more a stock market game than a train game, and so while the actions on the board are secondary, they still take up most of the playing time.  If I'm going to play a game about manipulating stocks, I'd prefer to focus my energies on that aspect and not on a very complicated board situation that only really matters in how it changes stock prices.  If that makes any sense to you, and you want to try an investing game with more focus on the investing, try [gameid=5] or [gameid=94]

El juego rey de trenes, una leyenda reeditada con un tablero bellísimo, de colores cálidos y textura granulada, de los que  piden que pases la mano para acariciarlo. 

Si te gusta la economía, en este juego podrás ser tan agresivo, voraz y expansivo como desees. Invierte, produce, vende y gana dinero a costa de los demás. Es de los juegos que hace brillar a los jugadores.

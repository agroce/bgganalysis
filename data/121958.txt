RATING: 5
*Rating based on one 2-player game.

Positives and negatives for Sky Traders:

+Interesting market fluctuation mechanism.

-Two-hour game that only has enough going on to be interesting for maybe an hour.
-A whole lot of randomness with dice rolls in combat, dice rolls for the market, dice rolls for dumping sludge, and random events.

Only played once so far, using the official rules. It seems to have potential, but it took ages with 5 (beginner) players and some of the players gave up and went home. I can see why some people are complaining that it's imbalanced and next time I will try out the directors cut rules. I think that perhaps the strategy in the game is not really deep enough to warrant such complicated rules.

Really wanted to like this but was ultimately a big disappointment.  

Long, repetitive and lots of randomness. Really liked the concept so I'd play it again but glad I didn't buy it.

Another below average eurogame from Fantasy Flight Games. The components and the artwork are nice as expected but thats really the only possitive thing I can say about the game. It is a pick up and deliver game where players buy and later sell goods from port to port. The market system seems broken and completely random. There are random events happening all the time. Players can even attack each other. You just roll a dice and the highest number wins!! If you keep attacking the leading player the game can last for ever. 
Better stay away from this game.

RATING: 8
This does appear to be quite a long playing game (probably a little too long for its own good unless you are really taken by the theme). The dependence on dice and the players 'open' hands are not as strategically limiting as some have suggested as I feel there are so many options open to a player during their turn that there is usually a money-making avenue open even if opponents are trying to shut you down. 
The production and artwork are of the usual high FFG standard. Card stock could have been heavier, but sleeves will cure that issue. As I particularly like Planet Steam and Merchants & Marauders I think this game will be right up my street somehow.

Tactical game of commodity speculation and luck.  Probably too long for what it is.  One issue is that the market can "stagnate", whereby even with the forced bounce off of the high and low ends, you can consistently have little or no change in the value of certain goods... this leads to a slow and painful game for some/many players as they wait for the market to improve for their good(s).  Another issue is that sludge-running can be quite lucrative if you roll well, and it might be overpowered as a money-making mechanism (perhaps that's why the author FAQ says to pay 1 GP per sludge dumped in the volcano instead of the die roll payout).  A third issue is the "Boatswain" crew card is an awesome card for running sludge & grog... you can avoid the bad wind cards that would otherwise wreck you... then you can buy another "Boatswain" ASAP for only 10 gold to continue to protect your contraband (grog) until the price spikes... I guess in the end, if anything's broken in the game, it might be the "Boatswain"... but it's one of the only strategic ways to cut down on the randomness of the game so I'm a Boatswain fan.  The game is an interesting ride/romp if played fast and not taken too seriously, but it's not a game that I need to own.

2012. Others say: Light, long, repetitive, random (esp. the financial market). Interesting market fluctuation mechanism. Lots of randomness with dice rolls in combat, dice rolls for the market, dice rolls for dumping sludge, and random events.

This game was a little frustrating to get started, there's a lot to look over as a first time player. It took a few rounds of play but once we got in the swing of things we were enjoying ourselves quite a bit.

They weren't kidding about the three hour player time. I think we played for four to five hours and still didn't finish the game.

We had fun playing it but there were too many flaws in the game and we were having to make far too many house rules on the fly. The biggest flaw of the game is influence and needing money in order to get it. You win the game by being the first to get 50 influence, which is earned by getting and spending gold - which you earn by buying and trading goods - which prices will raise and lower based on the current rounds economy.

When a player's airship is destroyed they start over with a new ship... and here is where the game is incredibly flawed: If a player's airship is destroyed and they have no money - they receive 10 gold from each player, which depending on how many players can be a lot of money. They also start over as if it were the beginning of the game so they also receive an extra 20 gold from the bank. Players eventually stopped buying and selling goods and resorted to starting battles and getting destroyed in order to get payouts from players and the games bank which could be up to 60 gold at a time. At the end of the round they'd spend all 60 on influence and again go into battle and get themselves destroyed.

Players stopped depending on and caring about the games economy and basically spent the majority of it committing insurance fraud. We found it hysterical, mostly because it felt like such a huge flaw.

Played once, easily one of my favorite games.  It can be long, depending on how the group plays it, but the time goes by super fast.  It has a good deal of strategy, while allowing for tons of social interaction.

Only reason it is not a 9 for me is because while the game could be as fast as 60 minutes, in order to not rush the game you really should give your group a 3 hour period just in case. The setup takes a few minutes, too.

I think it also might be group dependent.

This was a tough one to rate... and my rating may change. The game as it is published is more like 5. Has some problems. With the director's cut rules it is better but still not there, so the rules of the house we made that made it a lot more fun were:

Starting positions for all ships are on the volcano; the price of Phlogiston is inverse to the price of sludge x2. SO when sludge is at 1 fuel costs 10. Crew and ship improvements are half cost, no refunds; get money when picking up sludge, but NO money when dumping it.

Sounds like a massive change, right? Well, it is, and it was needed. That change along with the director's cut rules made the game a lot more calculating in its strategy. And made the "map" of cities matter.

Update... Had to knock a point off as the game's biggest charm for me is the market dynamic, but the game is sooooo short once players play for the points (as they should). This means many dynamics just don't ever matter in this game. Took a few plays to figure out this weakness, though.

Played for the first time as a two player time using the Director's cut rules.
It was enjoyable and my wife had tons of fun playing it. I am not sure if the original rules caused the game to have such a poor reaction but I think it is a decent game.

Can't wait to play again.

Amazing theme, board design and playing pieces, however very poor game mechanics (specifically: market manipulation) make this game unplayable. The designer has since released alternate rules (Gioacchino Prestigiacomo's 'Director's Cut') to address some issues. (Dec 2013)

This game does not match my play style very well. There are several strategies to pursue in the game. Only one leads to any success. For instance if you find yourself rolling dice for combat then you've made some sort of mistake. Piracy won't make you rich. If you're hauling sludge or digging for minerals then you're falling behind. The winning strategy is going long on 'Buy Low Sell High'. That's it. Boring!

This exceeded my low expectations that I set for the game. It did drag on a bit too long but I see there are some tweaks that should improve the game time. The rules weren't complex and fairly straight forward. As printed the influence cost was just a bit too high and the market needed a bit more control/stability. So once again Dust Games gets their game about 90% there but then just can't seem to get it over the hump from fair or good to something great. Which also sadly puts all there games into this sort of limbo where I feel they are quality enough to want to keep but as I trim stuff down it's up against a lot that I consider great and almost very good just don't cut it.

OK shame on me for getting roped into another Fantasy Flight with cute artwork and random game control. Seriously, is this all they can do, or the target market so simple, it is all they need to do to sell a game. Sky Traders is something akin to Monopoly, where you make obvious purchases based on the spot your pawn is on. Unlike Monopoly however, the game can screw you over with unpredictable event draws and chaotic market pricing vs an just opponent landing 'next' to your property.

It's very light and random and seems built for people who don't want the stress of having to rely on their own skill. There's too much randomness with events and die rolls to justify the planning required and the two-hour play time. 

What especially annoyed me was that when you get knocked out, you're not actually out of the game -- which would at least be merciful -- but you have to restart. However, you're so far out of it that it's pointless to make a player restart the game as it just prolongs the experience for everyone, but they have no shot of catching up anyway.

Game I really wanted to like out of the box.  I love pickup and deliver and the game was fun.  However, the game is a hot mess of different mechanics thrown together in one game to try to make it more interactive and fun.  This game was rushed to print and you can tell because with adequate playtesting the current rule set would have never made it to print.

In particular, the rules covering smuggling and wanted levels are poorly developed.  There is simply not enough risk in the game to smuggling, so it is overly lucrative.  By the rules, there are only two cards in the entire event deck that actually punish you for holding sludge or grog.  A friend of mine developed a variant where any time a hold containing sludge is damaged while on a city tile it counts as a spill and makes you wanted.

Settlers of Catan plus high piracy and combat! Can run a little long, and might have a bit too much randomness for some (maybe slightly more than Catan). Winning the game is all about negotiating with the other players to manipulate the market.  So recommended for groups that like the trading aspects of Catan or Genoa, and would enjoy the added flavor and adventure of Sky Traders

After one three-player game I am wondering where they put the fun.  It seemed that you had so little control of anything that making any decision was just a craps shoot.  The only strategy that seemed to work was take on as much sludge as possible to get the money.  Then use the money to advance your influence and hope you don't get one of the cards that breaks any hold that has sludge in it.  Dump the sludge in the volcano for more money.  Rinse and repeat.

Small game I ran across in the dent and ding bin of a game shop in my hometown that I wanted to do some more searching on. I've seen many reviews that say the market mechanic is too... predictable and harder to manipulate than the game makes you think With forced die placement, it makes it harder to make prices where you want them, artificially increasing the game to 2+ hours. I think I'd like to give it a try before I made a final judgement.

Cool theme, solid market mechanic. I like the council meetings at the end of each round and how these foster interaction and discussion without slowing the game down unnecessarily. Combat is horrible though. Combat definitely slows down the game and adds very little. We had one player attempt a full on pirate strategy and all he did was pull down anyone he came into contact with, extending play time while never having a chance of winning himself. The actual act of fighting is slow and the effect is has on both parties is always negative. Very poorly implemented and it easily drops my opinion of the game by a good amount. 

The problem then is that if you ignore combat all together the game has so many parts and concepts that are never used. Want to like this, but I can't.

I'm okay with randomness; I'm okay with take-that screwage; I'm okay when the game mechanisms screw you... but this does all three to the point of parody and dresses it up in a ball of fluff. Ooh, look - kittens!

A desperate mash of stuff goes on in this game and the market is unforgiving in a way that just makes me hate the game. Challenging is one thing, unforgiving another, but the way that things can be manipulated in this open information dice fest is frustrating and infuriating. I've never before played a game where, after you play your turn as Start Player, it feels like such an age before you get your next turn (obviously because you're last next turn) and where you feel that any good you might have achieved has been totally undone by the other players. This is not about winning or losing - I play games to have fun and I resent it when I feel the game wastes my time.

Each to his own, but I can't see how anyone can find a game amongst all the fluff. I hesitate to say: "broken", so I'll just say: "garbage".

Good thing I don't own it or I'd be tempted to burn it.

I think that the rules for this game have been written wrong.

The Investment phase states that the each the Positive and the Negative boxes at each end of the market value track for each time can only contain the number of die pictured which will result being forced to fill in the Negative side if the Positive box is already full and vice versa which will lead to no change to the price and this will happen quite a lot for the expensive items.

Now if you play with JokerSmiley's variant (which is how I think it is intended to be played) where as many die can be place in the positive or negative sides (not limited to placing the number of dice printed on each box) but you only count for number of dice printed on each box when evaluating the market movements. e.g. So for the Class 6 goods, 5 dice could be in the Positive box and only 1 in the Negative box. This works much better and you get commodities swinging from low to high more often and you have be in much more control of buying/trading die from other players. 

Also (after 2 games) I think that the random Shortage/Surplus rule should be dropped as it does not do much for the game at all as it randomly changes the price of the 2 of the goods by +1 and -1

Another note is the Volcano plays better if the reward is not multiplied by the number of barrels of sludge dropped into it, but just what the value of the die. This takes the emphasis of buying a boatswain, loading up on sludge and dumping it as you could make 60 gold per run if your lucky. (tho with the adjusted Investment phase it makes trading the high value goods more attractive.) 

It makes for a better game as players have more incentive to buy and sell goods, rather than sludge running.

The designers Directors Cut rules, that are in the forums do work a much better. and I see they have been updated again recently (since I traded the game)

I would get this game again at the right price, I traded it as something popped up that I really wanted and this was not getting as much table time.

I'm unsure of how to rate this. A lot I liked about it and yes, we played with the Directors Cut rules which after playing them, confirmed that I would like it better that way than how FFG published it. Maybe with more plays, I might enjoy this more.

The market felt a bit too volatile and it was just random rolls of dice that affected it as well as the occasional card from the ill wind deck. We could never get Grog cheap enough to buy and piracy fell to the wayside. I'd happily play it again, and hopefully it sees some light of day through an expansion or some sort of fixed version.

Sludge also seemed potentially lucrative, but I'm unsure of whether to adjust the directors cut version or not. I'd also maybe change the fuel rules as well. We took that action maybe twice and each time felt like a huge waste. Maybe you also collect $10 when you take the action? Seemed often like a wasted turn.

RATING: 3
I'm rating this a 3 because a 3 on BGG means 'Likely want play this again, but could be convinced'. The convincing would be done within the second if someone could find a way to play this game within 2 hours or less. 

If I would have to rate this game for it's mechanics, I would give this game an 8 or even a 8.5. I really like them and it's a quite refreshing way for a pick-up-and-deliver game in combination with a fluctuating picemarket. I also really like that you can go for risky goods as Grog or Sludge, but that there is a risk connected to doing that, by certain Ill Wind - cards.

But what turns me off completely is the playing time. Our first game with 4, WITH THE SHORT VARIANT, took almost 4 hours. And it can't stay interesting for 4 hours, then it really becomes to repetitive.

I think this problem could been easily fixed if FFG of the designer would have created a double sided victory point track, where the backside would have a simliar structure (as I like the basic idea that the last points or more expensive to buy), but you would only need 30 points for a win (with nu sludge in your cargo). I don't understand that neither the designer, neither FFG saw this big issue with this game and could come up with such an idea. Really a pity and I hope some who is good with a computer (or even better FFG thereselves) can create something like that and post it here.

When you first look at the game, it seems like there's a variety of ways to win, but in actuality, you find out pretty quickly that some strategies are just flat-out better than others. This wouldn't be a problem if it weren't for the fact that players can't all use the same strategy, meaning some will always be pigeonholed into the worse strategies simply by virtue of turn order. Couple that with the fact that the game can easily go for three hours, and you've got a game where someone is losing, knows they're losing, and can't really do anything about it.

All that said, I do still have a good time with Sky Traders. The flavour is fantastic, and I'm always a fan of the little pawns. There may be only a few strategies that are efficient for winning, but there are many that are just fun to do. I recommend it if you don't care about winning or high strategy. It's just fun.

RATING: 3
Economy/pick up and deliver: good.  Events: Surprisingly not bad.
PVP combat: rage quit.  Just run away now.
The basic problem is: there is a high opportunity cost for entering PvP combat, which means you must make a high demand of your target in order to make it worth risking combat.  But with a high demand, there is no incentive for your opponent to bother accepting it rather than just dying and starting over.  This leaves the attacker with nothing, and the defender with a new ship and free money.

It has potential, but it's too fiddly and too long for so light a game. 

Second play: it's way better with more players, but still too long for what it is. It need different ending conditions like: one time through the ill winds deck, or something similar

24-01-2015. Rated after 1 play.

In Sky Traders -a steampunk trading game- you are traders that move on a board and can buy resources and fuel to power your ship. There are 6 city spaces on the board that each sell one type of good and buy the other 5. After all players have taken their actions, all players roll 3 dice. These dice can be used to decrease or increase the value of the goods by 1, for each die that is assigned. These rolled dice are commedities that can be traded and sold. This makes the game swingy, goods that are incredibly cheap in round 1, can be the most expensive in round 2.

In addition to trading, there is combat in the game. When you and your opponent are on the same hex, you can attack. Attacking means basically that both involved players roll a die modified by their defensive personnel (say, a +1 to +3 or so). Whomever rolls highest damages the opponent. Damage is assigned to a random hold number of the opposing skyship, damaging the tradegoods. When all your holds are damaged, your ship is destroyed and you lose half your resources.

It's been ages since I have been interested in this game. After playing it, I am not sure if it's a good game or not. I did enjoy my play of the game.. I wonder who would like this game though. It seems that it might be too random for eurogamers and to too mathy/trading-based for ameritrash gamers.. The 6 reflects this.

My GF likes this game more than me, so it likely remain in the collection for now because I'd gladly play it if she wants.

Far too luck based, the economic model is a little broken, and generally a pretty game with little substance. 

It's a pity, with a few house-rules, I'm sure this game could be great - which begs the question why they weren't implemented in the design process.

I need to give the game another chance.  When we first played we didn't necessarily understand the end-game goal.  So we spent way too long to get way too low of a score.

Thank you Secret Santa 2012 ... I can't wait to get through the rules and get it on the gaming table !!

Having brought it to the table, I am less than impressed - no reflection on you SS 2012 as I asked for it but clearly I did not read enough about it before requesting it.

The economics are very flat ... there is no real challenge or inpiration to want to do more when playing.

Sky Traders is a perfectly fine game about trading, market fluctuations and piracy in some sort of a fantasy sky world. As most other Fantasy Flight Games, the game comes with  beautiful art work and solid components. Gameplay-wise, however, it is nothing more than simply "ok".

Merchants & Marauders in fantasy space. OK. Not quite, but with a broad brushstroke description you could almost be describing either game.

Rated 7 after my initial 3-player game. Dropped to 3 after my second (4 player) game lasting 5 hours.

The original (in-box) rules can lead to an [i]extremely[/i] static market. An errata possibly helps to correct this (but I haven't played with these corrected rules).

One day, I'll try this again. One day ...

Relatively poor components for a FFG game: thin heavy-duty paper "boards" (both player mats and central boards). Cardboard goods tokens, where wooden pieces would have been nice (& colour issues are possible in less than perfect lighting). Player mats should have a bit more info on them - maybe possible actions, definitely phlogiston expenditure costs.

Played 2 player- no deal making to speak of. Combat was a non factor as we didn't attack each other and did not get caught by any cards. I can see more strategy will be needed with more players as goods won't be as plentiful with only 10 of most types. More plays will tell.

Sky Traders is a game, which will astonish you with its looks and theme. Who would not wish to become captain of an airship? Thanks to this game, you can. And you can use it to trade materials and sell them with profit in other towns. You are kind of speculants. Whole planet is dependent on fuel called phlogiston. But price of goods is altered every round by all players voting for some of them. But before you market through to the end, it will take more than two hours, which is quite long. Fortunately rules contain faster variant, which will speed things up a little bit, but you will still jump over 90 minutes per game in two. But you will not be bored during the match, there is development the whole time. Some plans might be interrupted by bad luck, when it comes to Ill Wind cards. But it has a decisive side also in battles. Sky Traders is a game of intrigue and trading and that is, how we should approach it. And it excels in both. Its fun. We used evalutaion with word GOOD, but its just a little bit under a GREAT tag. Only the bad luck threw it down a little. But if you like its looks and theme, then you should definitely consider buying it. It is worth trying. But do not forget - use corrected rules!

I don't dislike this game at all. The way the game plays is what I wanted from it with the exception of it being a bit more on the random side then I tend to like things to be. The problem is the length of the game. I don't want to do this for more than 2 hours and truth is with 5 players you are looking at 4 hours or more. It's not THAT fun. Nothing changes. You don't develop an engine that needs that kind of time you just keep doing the same sort of things over and over again. NOT a good game design in that regard.

Played once...meh...might have potential, but the more I think about the design the less thrilled I am. For instance: sludge removal essentially can mean that cities close to the volcano will be pristine and the far ones will be covered in sludge because it never gets hauled away. Cities should be producing sludge at rates determined by their production and the price they'll pay to haul it based on how much of it has accumulated. Also, is it mining or stealing? The rules phrasing is mostly "stealing", which suggests it should be a bounty-trigger, especially if you steal a jewel.

And what kind of merchant (or smuggler) buys at the current retail price? Buying price should be a set fraction of the current selling price, especially for Grog, which not a single one of five players ever felt was worth buying. If this is the game's cocaine, the margin should be enormous and it should be dirt cheap to buy in the bulk form.

I had fun with this.  The rules are good and I liked the way the game works.  I think this will be more fun with more people.

whether the game is really good I think is going to boil down to how well the legal and secondary markets function.  Volatility, controlled or otherwise is fine, but static markets are especially bad if you dont have control over the micro changes.  Will take plays with 4 and more thinking to make me happy one way or another about this 

I also like the understated colors and style.  Its not as over saturated and garish as 99% of games are these days.  Dont get me wrong, I can go for some neon glowing meeples and high contrast black light friendly boards, but its a nice change of pace.  The art and style are both very well done IMO.

update : Not a good enough game in there.  dropping to 6.5 and that might be generous..

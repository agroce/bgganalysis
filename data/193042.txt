This is a surprise hit for me and my group. Very simple, quick and funny little game. If you like stacking, this will definitely produce hours of fun for you. The larger the group, the better the gameplay since there will be a greater chance somebody will screw up their construction badly, which will induce tons of laughter. Love it.

LIKE: Fun when played quickly and silly.

DISLIKE: Player elimination, but it's usually quick to jump back in. Dexterity dependent, bumping the table is bad. 

OVERALL: A silly game, plays like Jenga. Some social gamer groups would love this, I'll play it when asked but I'd not request it.

Clearly a descendant of [b]Bausack[/b], this one turns all of the original's rules and variants into mini-games.  A very clever design and the games are all short enough that no one will be out of the game for long. The components and box itself are quite impressive.  Likely a good party game too.

RATING: 9
The best dexterity game I have ever played. The pieces are chosen so well for the game and the different game modes also makes gameplay so interesting as you are not just building your own art for example. And once you are finished the art looks great and definitely a picture should be in order. A must try and buy if you can.

Great game. It does a good job of moving from one tone to another, so that you get a smorgasbord of play styles, without getting bogged down in any one. If you like real time, great! It's got real time. If you don't like real time, great! It's only going to be for a few minutes and then it will move onto something else. Like strategy? Great! There are strategic games. Don't like strategy? Great! It will move on to something else in a few minutes.

So, you get a full game's worth of time out of the game, while still being able to satisfy everyone, of every interest.

I generally like heavy strategy games. I do, occasionally, enjoy a party game if in the right company. This game, though, might be the best lighter/party game I've played. This game is awesome for non-gamers, for family, and for a Friday/Saturday night. The variation of cities makes it almost inevitable that the group will find one city they want to replay for a while. The only thing keeping this from a higher score is the warping of some of the wooden pieces. I have requested that the publisher replace 4 pieces. 

**Edit, April 2017: replacement pieces received.

RATING: 9
Silly fun, but with a greater variety than Jenga and without the convolution of Rampage/Terror in Meeple City. The different towns you visit add just enough newness to the gameplay while still adhering to the basic game structure. Still prone to typical dexterity pitfalls (frustration of falling structures, sometimes over too quick) but for my money, this is one of the best you can buy!

Best of the recent stacking games I played so far. It works better than Meeple Circus  because it's more intuitive and it's more fun than Decrocher la Lune (Catch the Moon) because there's more variance. It's strikes just the right balance between light hearted fun and challenge.

It's the type of game anyone can play, gamers and non-gamers alike and which is explained within five minutes. In the right mood it can be an hilarious laughter filled 30 minutes. Perfectly capable to end a game night with.

For those who like stacking games like Rhino Hero, this is a more complex version of the same thing with fun pieces and 10 or so different play modes. Perfect for a light game setting and solo play (to see how high you can stack those pieces generally), but not a ton of intense strategy here.  Fun party game, even though it's a touch pricey thanks to the components included, albeit those are of very high quality!

Nothing super unique here, but a nice set of stacking mini-games that is fun to play. Every game, you'll get a different selection of mini-games to play, with various scoring and piece allocation methods to each.

My main gripe with the game is its over-reliance on the tallest structure scoring for so many of the different games. I wish more creativity had been shown in the scoring methods.

Otherwise, if you like stacking games, this is a fun one. Not sure it's necessary if you already have some stacking games, but it's worth a look.

RATING: 8
Bausack has the best pieces. Riff-Raff is the most strategic and has the best WOW factor. But Junk Art is [i]the best[/i] stacking game. The pieces are great and the replayability is endless thanks to the combination of the city cards (it's like multiple games in one!) and the piece deck. I love that a lot of the game modes have multiple ways to score, too. 

My one complaint is that because the game modes are purely random, you can get yourself stuck in a situation where it is literally impossible for players to catch up to the leader. More than that, some cities just have a MUCH higher amount of possible points, essentially determining the winner mid-game. 

With some knowledge of the cities, you can self-balance by designing the order of play - e.g., identify the "winner determining" city and always make it the last round. It would have been nice if the game had divided these into rounds for you, but in a game where most players (including yours truly!) aren't really going to care about score anyway, it's a small price to pay.

Is this from the guys who made Belfort???  They must have been under contract to produce  a game pretty quickly to have thrown together this re-hash of existing stacking games.   If you already have a dexterity/stacking game, you certainly don't need this one.  The game tries to be original by using pieces in shapes that aren't in other stacking games AND using cards to indicate building rules for the round.  The building rules on the cards feels random, but also forced.  Way overproduced packaging.  Too much money for just more of the same.  Disappointing.  Pass.

I'm not a fan of dexterity games.  But luckily this is pretty short and very light.   You build a structure without toppling it...using oddball pieces.  The rub is there are different rules for building it in each round.  Round 1, everyone builds their own. Round 2, everyone adds a piece to the central building.  Round 3, etc...

My kids may like this game so I could actually see buying it.  On the other hand, they may get frustrated when their tower falls and not want to play it again.  :)

RATING: 8
Clever dexterity game where players stack quality wooden pieces on a pedestal, making "art" from "junk".  The rules for the game are dictated by the current "city" the artists are competing in, and they inject nice variety.  Most dexterity games are hit and miss, but this one definitely hits.  The design of the 15 different types of pieces in the game is very well done.

Had fun playing this, but for the price there is no way I would buy this.  Way over-priced and over-produced... which means it is fun to play somebody else's copy.   It is essentially an incremental improvement in the stacking/dexterity category.   Like all stacking games, one bump of the table ruins it.

RATING: 7.5
In evolutionary terms Jenga is a primitive life form to Junk Art’s sophisticated being. The beauty of the game is the variety of games within the game. There are around 12+ rule sets and in a game you play three of them. For example the aim may be to create the tallest structure in a game where you have to play a piece your neighbour tells you to. Or it might be building on a common structure in the middle and avoiding being responsible for a collapse. All of the tasks are entertaining and enthralling.

The pieces fit together in interesting ways, a little like the wonderful way they do in Animal Upon Animal.

Downsides? I would have liked more task cards, I am sure they could have thought of a few more ways to play. And I got a little annoyed that a major section of the rules and the game is devoted to a set-up with Flick 'em Up!. I know in the bubble of a Publisher’s world this must have seemed a great idea. But in the real world where the overlap between owners of the two games will be minimal it just feels a waste, and I’d have preferred more time and energy going into more scenarios purpose-built for this game.

But that aside it is fast, great fun, and, along with Hamsterrolleand Animal Upon Animal, amongst the greatest of Dexterity games.

Junk Art is chock-full of variety. The competitions are mostly unique and allow players to shift their focus throughout the game. Unfortunately, not all of said competitions are created equal.

I like the mixed gameplay of the various cities in the world tour, and the variability of all the pieces, with some being fiendishly difficult to stack, thus you hope to force them on your opponents. 

Rules are not terrible clear and there is a lot of cross referencing which adds to the frustration as reaching for the rulebook can knock the table and thus everything comes crashing down.

There is a small frustration at the player elimination aspect as if you are knockout early you may have to sit and wait a while if the other players are stacking well.

Fun stacking game. This game has more legs to it then it first appears. There are 4 differently colored piles of wood bits of which you use to construct your masterpiece with making it really tall usually the main goal but the way you do that is through doing a world tour (mini games) so depending on the city you go to it could have a very different sub objective with the main goal at the end you get a victory point (fans) payout of 5/3/1 based on who is the tallest. My favorite city to visit is Tokyo where you have 10 cards and you select one for you opponent to use in their structure it can be crazy inventive to see what people will do to avoid build with pieces.

Length: around 1 hour
Mechanics: this is a dexterity game, combined with some speed and card selection
Decisions: not much, just what piece you force other to build, or where to put yours
Opinion: this is a dexterity game that have come to stay with me. The basic rules are really easy, just pick the piece you have to place and do that the best way you can, but you have several cities with different rules that make the game funny. Just pick up one of the three pieces ready to build, decide which piece the next player has to build (thinking that you will have to continue his structure son), build as fast as you can or as high as you can.... giving the game lot of variability and lot of fun

Oh, Junk Art.

Many of the rulesets are better than other balancing games, and the variety is nice, but the scoring seems designed for a 3 or 4 player game. With 5 or 6, I think you need variant rules.

This game makes me want to create cards for Bandu blocks so I can play Junk Art with more pieces. It also makes me want to just play more Junk Art.

But really, the scoring is terrible. Play them as minigames and enjoy them.

The scenario cards are what make this game enjoyable, and set it apart from something outdated, like Jenga. I'm not sure about the longevity of Junk Art, but it's definitely fun to play at least a few times.  Good production quality.

2-6 players. A stacking game. Some modules are real-time. Similar to Bausack/Bandu. Complaints about warped wooden parts and bad customer service (/thread/1777090, /thread/1835794, and redd.it/5wxb0f). Seems like it would get old fast (/video/129716 and youtu.be/IcDDcehEn9M).

Initial Rating: 6.0 (December 2017)

As is usual from me, when I bought Junk Art, I didn’t know anything about it. A friend read the rules and he told me it was a dexterity game so I thought I was going to sell it after playing it, but to my surprise, I really enjoyed it and I will (perhaps) keep it in my collection.

Junk Art´s rules are easy to teach, you can do it under 2 minutes. Playtime is around 50 minutes.

The game´s components are good.

Junk Art is a fun game, I really like that each round is played under a different set of rules (the best feature of the game). In each round you have to try to accomplish the goal to get fans, the player with more fans wins the game. You do this by stacking the pieces as best as you can. All players liked the game, I think I’m the one who liked it the least, but I do like it.

Bottom line, Junk Art is one of the best dexterity games I have played, I wasn’t expecting anything good from it, but it surprised me. Junk Art is an ok game for me. In general, I don’t like dexterity games that much but I want to play Junk Art with my SO to decide if I should keep it or not. Good game for the family.

A wonderful entry into the dexterity category. It is similar in ways to Sac Noir, in that it's a stacking pieces type of dexterity game. Junk Art takes that as a starting point and builds several mini-games around the core experience. Each mini-game has it's own feel adding a lot of variety and fun to the experience.

If you think Jenga sounds fun... then this is clearly the game for you. It's quick (maybe 10-15 minutes per round), it's hilarious (take that mechanics and big falls), and best of all it's both simple to teach and learn but also complicated enough to make you think about what you should do. I don't think there is a family dexterity or building game that is any better than this. You could get it out at a college party and everyone will enjoy it... and then you could play it with a group of kindergartners with the same success. Sounds like a 10...

Refreshing take on the balancing-stuff genre, dividing the game into three short and randomly-selected minigames, which play out quite differently. The scoring is a bit broken in that you can enter the final round knowing that whatever happens nobody can catch the leader, but scoring doesn't really matter that much.

Heard a lot of good things about this game but it did not click with me. The component quality was good but the shapes to me felt weird. I do however like the concept of having a lot of different game types in the box and I did like the nice and bright colors of the pieces. This is however the first modern stacking game I played so maybe I am just not a big fan of stacking games. Unfortunately a pass for me.

This game is "ok", but only if you don't have the classic "Bausack" (now also called "Bandu") at your disposal, which not only has far better (chunkier, prettier, funnier) pieces, but also vastly superior game-play, especially if you manage to dig up all those fantastic variations that used to be in the rules years ago, but have mysteriously vanished from recent editions.

(12/16) 8. While perhaps not the most unique game ever, unique nonetheless.  I like the mini game style which keeps it from getting stale quickly.  Very memorable second place finish in my first game to Franci. :-)

(9/17) Drop to 7. Well, maybe the limited number of mini games did it, but it seems to have gotten a bit stale.  Still a go to game for a new group, but those who've played it aren't necessarily dying for another round. Still, a very, very solid game.

I haven't played all the modes yet, but so far I'd say this is my favourite dexterity game (keeping in mind that I don't play many of those). It eliminates many of the problems I have with dexterity games: doing the same thing over and over again, annoying set-up, and taking too long for what the game is. The different shapes keep things interesting, and the final sculptures give the game a very nice visual look.

What a game! The pieces are great, the replay value is excellent with many game modes in the box but what makes it for us is our home-made No Thanks! (see card game) variant! Don't want that awkward piece? Best pass with a token then (you give everyone some tokens to start just for passing purposes) but if you run out of tokens then you have to take the piece so like the card game you need to know when it's best to pass or take a piece that you can place that ideally also has some tokens built up on it through people repeatedly passing. Winner is the person who doesn't have any pieces fall off their structure. Genius!

We were looking for a dexterity/balance game and it did not dissapoint us. Very fun to play, different modes, assure long lifeof the game.

+ Quality of items. Albeit in plastic, very good quality of materials used.
+ Quantity of items. A big variation in the "art" can make each one relevant in a different setup.
+ Variaty of cities equals to variaty in rules, so you have 10 (or so) different versions of the game.
+ Each play requires ~15 minutes from start to end, so in less than an hour you finish 3 cities.

- Rules are difficult to follow if you only read the cards. You got to have the manual next to you.
- Box. Seriously, why chose a box which doesn't allow the easy storage of the items? And also, doesn't have a different case for the cities and the junk. Its inside case is also made from light paper.
- Unispiring follower marker. We instead use pen and paper to write our followers. Why make only a simple white marker?

Fast, fun, very easy to learn dexterity game where you try to stack odd-shaped wooden pieces without having them fall. The game consists of a bunch of different variations that you randomly choose between for each session, and many of them have a card-drafting element that adds a bit of light strategy. The pieces are very well-made and well-thought-out; some of them interact with each other in interesting ways, leading to lots of possible workable configurations. This was a big hit with the family.

Bausack levelled-up in a truly great way. The problem with the original Bausack/Bandu is that the open ruleset left casual gamers struggling, which is a big issue if that's your exact target market. By providing a dozen carefully-plotted building mechanisms, Junk Art elevates the whole much more than the sum of its parts.

I'm a big fan of dexterity games, especially when they are well done and this is one of those. You build up a tower of awkward pieces but the best part is that the objective slightly changes round to round. Generally you want to build it high, but sometimes you also need to be fast, make combos or try to sabotage others. Lots of fun and plays really quickly, often requiring many plays.

The thing I like about stacking game is that is an exploration, assessment and challenging test of how to balance the weight of an object taking in factors of what will happen if I put the object here or there. In Junk Art the object cards and city rules allow simultaneous turns (dex games are generally boring to watch) and enough variety to keep each game fresh.

A dexterity game where you play three rounds. Each round has a randomly selected card that gives you the special rules. Each set of rules is a fun and interesting stacking game. The pieces are colorful, and the shapes are pretty interesting. The whole thing is quick, well constructed and really just a delight to play. Winning a round gives you some amount of points, but really points are meaningless, as by the second round it's possible for a player to be too far ahead for anyone to catch him with the reward from the third round. Really, this isn't a game about points, the fun comes from tackling the different challanges, the points are better off completely ignored.

Just doesn't work. Some pieces are obviously too difficult to stack and players will use them to bring the game to a screeching halt. There are many better stack games out there, especially considering the price.

I have hestitated to rate this game until it consistently passed a litmus test of widespread appeal, initially wondering if it was just a one-hit-wonder. It did just that, and with flying colors. Unless you possess a particularly sour disposition, one simply cannot resist stacking blocks. Each time I have brought the game out, players take to stacking immediately before the rules are explained. If I let folks stack blocks for the next half hour, I do not think they would have noticed the absence of a game. This does speak to its shallowness to a degree, as really, the points were almost always an afterthought. However, when conditions of the game were introduced, everyone maintained a healthy sense of competitiveness and engagement, and not without a rowdy dose of laughter. This is a wonderful dexterity-based party game.

(+) Immediately accessible. It has yet to fail to appeal to anyone I have introduced it to, be they young, old, gamer, or non-gamer.
(+) Beautiful and eye-catching components. Visually appealing in every sense of the words.
(+) Possesses just the right hint of strategy in line with the lighthearted tone of the game. 

(-) Some wood pieces have very minor warping. Silica gel packs recommended to avoid it become a serious issue.
(-) Contains player elimination. Games do not last long enough for this to be a major issue.
(-) Shallow "game" present.

We played this one evening at the Giant Eagle meet ups. Curt taught it. I liked it enough to buy it. The set I got was the plastic version and I didn't know if I would like it as much as we enjoyed the wooden version but it ended up being just as fun and sturdier than I thought it might ne. This is probably my favorite stacking game to play.

Played this at Spiel Essen 2016. Balked at the price so I didn't buy it. Got it later for Sinterklaas anyway, for even more money. It's fun (like it's brother Flick 'em Up), and (unlike its brother Flick 'em Up) super easy to set up. And it looks really really nice on the table.

What I do not like is that the box lid is warped, so it does not close all the way. Ironing it flat helped temporarily, but it warps back again. Will have to see what the store can do for me.

Ugh this game. Ugh. This is one of those "How haven't I thought of this??!" designs where you're just having the time of your life playing it. It's so simple yet so much fun. I could play this all day and not tire of it. It's dexterity at its core, so if you don't like games like that you definitely won't like this, but I've played this with gamers, non-gamers, and even my 6-year-old niece, and EVERYONE has enjoyed this. Ugh.

This is a go-to party game for any family looking to introduce non-gamer relatives to the hobby.

It also includes a variant that can only be played with pieces from Flick Em' Up. Love it!

I usually don't enjoy dexterity games and in fact I wasn't a fan of Pretzel Games' other really popular dexterity game, Flick 'Em Up.  But I gotta say this may be my favorite dexterity game I've ever played.

The game is essentially a collection of mini-games.  Each round there is a different objective dealing with stacking assorted pieces of different shapes.  Sometimes you are giving pieces to other players to place, sometimes you are all building on the same structure, and other variations of construction using these shapes.

It is super simple but something about it really resonated with me.  It was difficult but pretty fair and a lot of fun.  There is friendly screwage as you give other players really difficult pieces and all enjoy the magic of engineering they manage to pull off.

Pretzel Games does unfortunately charge a premium for most of their games which is a shame because I finally found a game I would like and this is a fun for everyone style game.  I get that they are high quality wood components.  But they aren't 100 dollar high quality wood components...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
It was interesting dexterity/party game as the pieces have different shapes and each round had different scoring rules.  The wooden pieces were well made and despite seeming to be completely random shapes, they all kind of fit together with the other shapes. I liked how the game stayed fresh by having the players randomly select 3 different scoring rules (one for each round). 

We definitely had a lot of laughs at the table when playing this. Surprising stressful as you don't want your stack to fall. Overall, an interesting dexterity game, not typically a fan of these types of games though, but with the right group looking for a light game it's great!

I have to admit that this game is better than I thought.  It is not just building the structures as high as you can, there are a lot of different challenges which will keep the game fresh and interesting for every time you play.  But ultimately, this is just not the kind of  game that I seek to play very often.  I will not refuse to play it, but I will not be rushing out to buy this either, but nor would I refuse it if given to me as a gift.  Maybe I need to play this game again....

You have to build various sculptures as dictated by the particular "City" card. I stink at this game. I have a pretty steady hand and no caffeine addiction, so theoretically playing with building blocks should be a piece of cake. Not even close! Maybe it's that spacial perception issue I have. Oh, well. My daughter, however, is amazing at this game.

Junk art is a super fun game that anyone can play. It comes in a beautiful box and has nice wooden components. I have played this game with my family, drinking with friends, and even in my classroom with ESL kids. Everyone loved it. There are a lot of fun rules for each city.... often trying to build the tallest structure or be the last person standing. This game was well worth the price and I doubt I will ever get rid of it. I hope Pretzel Games continue to come out with more great games. I also own Flick em Up which is great but do not get it out nearly as often as Junk Art.

I gave  this game to my daughter for Christmas (2016) she likes dexterity games and I thought Junk Art might appeal to my wife and son.  As my son much prefers video games it has become increasingly difficult to find a game for all four of us.

Junk Art was a success!  Everyone enjoyed it and wanted to play a second time.  There is player elimination (for a round or two) and some cities have more downtime then others but I really like the replayability that the city cards add in.

Although we will probably be keeping Jenga and Animal Upon Animal I think Junk Art is the best of this type of game.

A excellent mix of tension,laughter, and art in a dexterity game - for 2-6 people. It is the opposite of Jenga in that you are building up a tower rather than taking away. There a 4 different colors of 15 different parts, which are intelligently designed to interact with each other. The excellent rulebook gives you ten or so different ways to play this game. My favorite is the 'Montreal' scenario, where you hand pieces to build to your neighbor, and you take over their structure after every 3 moves - try not to screw 'future you' with difficult parts! This is a surefire party winner.

I've only played with the oversized demo components Pretzel Games had at GenCon 2016. It seems like a novel push-your-luck dexterity game. Could be especially fun with the younger (or intoxicated) crowd).

I'm not sure if the smaller components that come in the retail box would be as fun to build with, though.

Don't expect a game that will make you feel smart, but DO expect one that will have your friends saying, "Wow, I can't believe you pulled that off." You won't look at your structure and marvel at its beauty, but you will probably marvel at the fact it's still standing, lol!

I haven't played many dexterity games (shaky hands) but the variability built into Junk Art is certainly a major draw for choosing this above others I'd say. Pieces are lovely and most of the different rules are fun. If only I had a set with the large exhibition pieces instead.

Imagine Jenga meets Mario Party; and all the hilarity, drama, rage, yelling, and straight-up fun that that thought entails. 

I cannot recommend this game highly enough. The components are beautiful, there is so much room for creativity/customisation, and you can get absolutely anyone around the table with this one. 

Do yourself a huge favour and grab this if you can.

Pales in comparison to the glory of Bausack.  Rounds are short which might suit some but I like getting invested in my tower and being proud of it.  Pieces aren't as clever as Bausack.  Pieces are also a bit wobbly and not as sturdy as in Bausack which makes it hard to build satisfying towers.

Otherwise the concept is excellent.  I like the variable rules and the piece drafting with cards works pretty well.

[b]Multiple sessions, ranging from 2p to 5p, plastic version[/b]:

Great dexterity game with a decent amount of variants offering lots of replayability and some light decision-making. Game pieces are unconventionally shaped, sturdy and high quality. Variable end-game conditions for many scenarios can be used as a strategic asset but can also be anticlimactic as things can end prematurely. Suitable for 2p but the more, the merrier. A bit of downtime can be present in turn-based variants at larger player counts, but it's always fun to watch the active player struggling to place their piece(s).

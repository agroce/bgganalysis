RATING: 8.55
A worthy successor to one of the best games ever created, but still not better than it's older brother. I like how tech tree now has a better integration with the rest of the gameplay, this is the best improvement. Variability of the board is a nice touch, although we never had a problem with the fixed map layouts in Terra Mystica. Gameplay is fairly similar, as it should be, with some nuances in resources and races - which is a good refreshment. Art is ok-ish, but the graphic design is subpar. The publisher did not listen to players that pointed out this early in the testing phase, which is not fine in my book. All in all, it is Terra Mystica in space, it can not be bad. And it is not - it is a great game, just not as good as it could have been.

RATING: 10
Takes the weakest part of Terra Mystica (cult tracks) and transforms it into one of the best, most interesting parts of this new iteration. Also the modular board is better obviously but not just because its modular it's also visually more appealing. I was also surprised by how better the space theme was especially since I'm not much of a sci fi fan. 2 more additional currencies in addition to power, money and workers as well. This game is about 75% old Terra Mystica but is shockingly different and better than the original despite all the similarities. Very complex I cannot imagine learning this straight out of the box, but a must have for hardcore gamers, Terra Mystica fans, and the game I am most looking forward to getting a copy of.

Terra mystica is already a very nice and neat game. In particular, the power token system is very interesting - too close high competitiveness over surrounding planets, too far away in general cannot use various common actions.

But as below, I would like to list the reasons why I prefer gaia project than terra mystica:

1. investing in research tracks provide resources, not only for scoring.
2. diminish slightly the competitiveness over tracks and tech tiles - opponent's promotion in a research track does not affect your scoring in that research track and no sold-out of tech tile.
3. never complete blocking, qics can bring off a competitive region to a less competitive region, towns can be formed no matter how far they are, provided that you have sufficient power tokens.
4. players can gain back power tokens
5. can randomize the map instead of play a fixed map every game.
6. every small variation give freshness and new experience.
7. Not yet identified any op fractions in general.

Of all the massive improvements they made to the Terra Mystica system, the new races stand as shining examples of how you design asymmetry. I doubt they're balanced, but the unique powers are exciting and generally don't force you down one path anymore. The rest of the game is excellent, with a technology track that is an absolute joy to explore game to game.

While the game is pretty much flawless, I will have difficulty getting people to play this I'm sure. I hope to get my heavier euro friends deeply invested in playing this with me.

Initial rating after one play. Really its an outstanding game and I think it will end up as a 10 for many people. 

I found myself having the same reaction that I did to Le Havre.  This game is all about planning. Not only are you thinking about your next few turns but your upcoming turns in future rounds, constantly planning ahead. Its taxing and sometimes I don't want to plan so much in a game.

For now though, I can't wait to play it more.

Best game I have played in 2017.

Pros :
 Amazing puzzle game play 

Lots of varied set up each game
           
Tech board is now the beating heart of the game and not tacked on like the temple board is in TM

Much prettier and better table presence than TM

Some very clever new and exciting gameplay mechanics

The plastic components are actually very nice and DO fit the theme well.

Cons 

Rubbish first played token

Rubbish turn order card

Curling up player boards

Curling up space sector tiles

Curling up end game points board

It's Terra Mystica with more stuff and in space. Some of the changes are really good and it is very similar to the original in a lot of ways. There are different races and you are terraforming planets in space so that you can build on them. You can only land on planets and you must terraform completely in order to land there. The planets are generally a space or two apart so there is more room on the board to get around. This also means that upping your navigation is usually more important than upping your shipping in TM was. The technology tracks are good and I like how the tech upgrades are randomly distributed between the tracks and interact with them in how you can climb a track when you get a tech. The advanced technologies are also an interesting extra scoring option. I like the idea about a map that can have a different set up from game to game, assuming it doesn't mess with the balance too much. Some of the special powers for the races are interesting... I played with a race that had a "brain" power cube that was worth 3 power and I gained an extra power regularly; this allowed me to trash a single power from bowl 2 to use my 3 power piece in bowl 2. The fact that players can gain power (add it to a bowl) is a nice tweak. The Transdim planets can be transitioned to Gaia planets. Anyone with a QID (resource) can land on a Gaia planet and Transdims can be turned into Gaia planets, but requires some developing your race first. I like that it took an action to form a federation (town in TM) because it made the timing even more important... and, I could choose how to create that federation with satellites.

All in all, this feels like a high quality game. I've played Terra Mystica a bunch and the problem with Gaia Project, for me, is that I'm not sure I can sustain playing both of them enough to realize the value they both bring. I still feel like I'm learning more about TM with it's expansion after 23 plays. BGG shows it as a "reimplement," so maybe my expectations for a new game were just off, but exploring the races and how the randomness of where the different technology tiles and advanced technology tiles are placed would be fun. This game does seem to scale between 3 and 4 players which is good because TM didn't do that well.

RATING: 7
Only played the printed out beta-test. After two games: It is a variation on Terra Mystica with more variable set-up and more clunky rules. I usually play about 10-15 games of Terra Mystica a year, since my usual game group has a few Terra Mystica fanatics. On my own I would most likely play a few games a year. Therefore I am content to own Terra Mystica and maybe at some point buy the Fire & Ice expansion. Additionally I feel that, if I would own both Terra Mystica and Gaia Project, I would always pick Terra Mystica from the shelf.

RATING: 9
Two personal gripes: 1. The dorky game name. It should have been called Astra Mystica, or even Gaia Mystica. 2. The dorky names for Ivits (instead The Hive or Der Schwarm) and Bescods (instead of Mad Androids). 

Terra Mystica on steroids! Lots to induce brain overload.
Even more infinite replayability because of the variable map, and variable technology set up; along with 14 new factions.

This one delivers! Essential for any TM fan, as this one ramps it up. 
Probably too heavy for anyone but diehard gamers.

The theme totally suits the game, as the original TM was intended to be in a sci fi setting. 
Glad to see it perfected in the sequel. 

We don't need the Agricola/Caverna debate here.
Both TM and Gaia Project are awesome in their own right. Both of these titles are worthy in one's collection.

Play time seems to be increased, especially upfront, assessing the random board and techs is essential to choosing your faction. There are a few new currencies in the game as well. The last 2 rounds can take a long time to play.

Terra Mystica really shined because it was that rare asymmetric game where the different factions didn't play the player. After initial play testing, GP seems to be that the factions play you more.

Update Dec 2017
A few criticisms that keep this from being a 10 like Terra Mystica
1.  Can be heavy to the point where it is too heavy 
2. Round 5 and round 6 can take a long time to play.
3. A number of the factions are lacklustre and unexciting. 
4. Too many of the factions don’t even have an innate ability. (Auren anyone?). They just start off on one of the six research tracks. Boring. 
5. The planetary institutes (like TM’s strongholds) as still red herrings. If you build them early, they will ruin your economy. The earliest you can build them is mid game. And so that means you don’t get to use their abilities that many times in the game. 
6. The research dependent factions have slow starts and just seem weak. (Very early impression). 
7. Most of the factions, you are forced to move up the travel track asap. This just seems so scripted that it is de rigueur.
8. The factions play you more than you playing the factions. That was hardly the case in TM.

Where GP is better than TM:
1. The techs/ favours are variable with track location. A lot more combos for setup. 
2. The six tech tracks are thematic and integrated better with the body of the game. 
3. The map set up is variable, creates for exponentially more combos. 
4. The factions are less map dependent. 
5. The map can be scaled for two players.
6. No apparent fav11/earth1 bias with any of the techs. 
7. Equal number of techs with the number of players.

RATING: 10
The solo game is great fun and a challenge! A lot of depth and many choices to make here - I highly recommend if you enjoy complex economic games, but recommend against if you do not enjoy facing endless difficult choices.

Update after 9 plays: I think this has become one of my new favorite games of all time! Excellent!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
The good thing is: it's very similar to Terra Mystica. The bad thing: the small changes make you have to rethink stuff all the time.

The additional randomness at setup, the possibility of building further away, and the fact that federations (towns) can be formed with more ease, all these give you a lot more options, which means increased complexity and increased time of play. I do like the races, and love the tech tracks, except...

After the second play I have one big complaint: the advanced techs & going to step 5 of a tech track can get pretty confusing. Spending 4 knowledge to advance on tech tracks but not getting a tech tile is pretty confusing too.

This is a straightforward quality euro. Relatively easy to learn, with great art and components, a must have for people that love resource conversion games. The various factions play a shade differently from each other, there's a new variable order variant, the board is modular, and the tech tree is interesting enough to not make me miss the cult track of Terra Mystica. The gameplay is tight and the races I have played seem well balanced. The Automa programmed opponent rules and deck results in a superb solo experience that's very hard to beat, and not fiddly at all. 

On the negative side, my pre-release Essen copy had warped cardboard mats, but nothing serious. Also, if you are looking for mechanical innovation, look elsewhere, this is Terra Mystica redux.  And the 100 USD MSRP of ZMan games is just Asmodeecally offensive...

A quality game that takes the TM formula as we know it, adds a few bells and whistles, and creates a fine new specimen . 

Recommended, one of the top games of the Essen 2017 crop.

Update: Three plays in and my initial comments still stand. The space theme is better suited to the mechanics. If I were given a choice between playing Terra Mystica or Gaia Project, I would absolutely choose the latter. 

After one play the space setting feels more evocative than the fantasy setting of Terra Mystica. Much of the latter is still present with multiple currencies and terraforming. Not sure why, but in some senses the game is more intuitive while in others not. More on that after a few more plays.

I love games with spatiality, and the spatial aspect of Gaia Project feels - on one play - much, much more interesting/satisfying than TM's did. I liked the tech trees better than the cult track, too.

It does share some of the dynamics from TM that I grew less fond of over time, but overall, a lovely upgrade.

Just the same game as Terra Mystica, with a few adjustments that make the game slightly better (the planets in open space offer more freedom to expand and the satellite net is also a good ideia).
The theme is also a little more integrated with the game, although it remains in (a very) second plan.
If you want to try Terra Mystica skip that out and try this one instead.

Managed to learn this at the Monday night meetup in the area. There were a lot of no shows and so had to only play this at two against someone who had a half dozen plays in. The game felt more engaging that TM and I can see how the random seeding of bonuses on the tech board will make each play less and less scripted. There's still a ton of stuff to do and keep track of. The federation rules were a bit tough to grok until we went through a game. Would like to play this one again and might at the next meetup.

When Gaia Project was announced as a Spiel 2017 release, I was sure that I would give it a pass. I do enjoy Terra Mystica (TM), but I thought I wouldn't need an upgraded version of it.  
After playing my first game, I knew that I would have to get it.  Gaia Project just feels more coherent. I didn't really care for the temple tracks in TM and always felt like there was something missing. By linking the upgrade actions to the science tracks (aka "the new temple tracks"), Gaia Project eliminated the one thing that always bugged me. Couple this with a variable setup and some interesting race abilities and you have a winner.
But don't get me wrong. I don't think that you will like Gaia Project if TM already was too much of an optimization puzzle for you. The core elements haven't really changed. It's still "just" an upgraded version of TM. But for me, the changes were mostly a step in the right direction. I say mostly, because what I really don't like are the plastic pieces. Somehow they give me a hard time reading the board state. I find it way more easy to see what is going on when playing TM. Also, I prefer having resource markers instead of the resource tracks. In TM, I would always set aside some heaps when planning my turns. I find it way harder to do this with the resource tracks. But this are minor nitpicks. Obviously I can live with them and I'm really looking forward to my next play. Two thumbs up!

I liked the idea of Terra Mystica, but things like perceived imbalances of races, and the nonmodular board had me worried that the game wouldn't have legs in our group. Gaia Project looked like a better fit for us.

After 5 games, I can conclude that this game is the worthy successor for Terra Mystica. The mechanics of this game has been refined to perfection from its predecessor and has been so elegantly implemented. I really loved the implementation of the tech tree that defines/shapes how you play the game especially each tech tree comes with its own perks unlike TM. The overall gaming experience is always fun, brain-burning and exhilarating. Definitely a 10 for me!

Early days - take the second best game of the 2000’s (so far) and make it better.  The production is let down by player boards that want to warp, despite many days of flattening, which hinders game play (they turn into spinning tops at the lightest touch).  

It’s 90% Terra Mystica, with a little removed and a little added.

First impressions: I traded away Terra Mystica after a dozen games or so because I began to feel like my strategy was just to do my race’s special power as much as possible. I have hope I will like GP more because the powers seem a little more subtle, and there is a lot more variability built in. The game clearly is better suited for 2 player play as well.

UPDATE 13Jan2018: Wow, so good and I think this blows away TM.  I love the variety and the multitude of strategic options.

I'm a fan of Terra Mystica so learning this game was not complicated at all. My comment will be based on how the two games compare. It feels much easier than TM, but I like that you have more options that what TM has to offer.

The graphics, arghh it's just lazy. The components however are stellar with the plastic miniature pieces.

RATING: 7
Unnecessarily complex version of Terra Mystica, and not as good.

Terra Mystica in space.  [thing=220308][/thing] has been labelled the Terra Mystica Killer.  I am not so sure. But then TM is one of my favourite games, so Gaia had a long climb to reach such heights.  It failed.

The main improvement Gaia has over TM is the tech tree (instead of the priest track).  It is brilliant.   Also the tech tiles (the favor tiles in TM) are more balanced with the removal of the TM Earth 1 tile (having only three Earth 1 tiles, which gives 2 points for every dwelling built, is a major issue with TM as it is by far the most powerful Favour).  
Oh, and the modular board gives this game more variety.

The downsides? 
To me the game just got unnecessarily more complex:
- the Transdim planets add an unnecessary level of complexity.
- The green G.I.C. cubes add another currency and so another level of complexity
- the Variable end-game bonuses will play into the strengths of certain races.  This can only be overcome by auctioning off the races.
- the way towns (now called colonies) are built is much looser and less easy to grasp.  Towns are so easy they become less challenging to build. Maybe this could also be seen as a good thing.
- adjacency is two spaces which is less easy to see.
- the plastic bits are...well, plastic. 

So at the moment I still prefer TM, which is much easier to teach and plays more intuitively.  The Tech Tree in Gaia is great, if only they had simply ended the changes at that.

[b]Terra Mystica in space[/b]. Extremely good, with mechanics much desired but not present in it's predecessor, mainly modular game board and technology track. Races are also more balanced and there are more types of resources. It also scales much better from 1 to 4 players (which is now maximum). However, I miss the tightness, struggle, resource counters and especially artwork of [b]Terra Mystica[/b]. So the rating, while still great, is not better.

If you like Terra Mystica, you will like Gaia Project.  If you don't like Terra Mystica, you will not like Gaia Project.  Rather than a retheme or a rebalanced version, Gaia is more like a sequel.  The core of the game is exactly the same, but almost every aspect has been made more complicated and more exciting.  There are more resources, more ways to score VP, more available actions.  There's also more depth to the cult track, player factions, and player interaction.  It's awesome, and most definitely warrants a purchase.

2017-01-04 : First play. Well, actually not as I've played Terra Mystica and its expansion a good number of times and this game is virtually identical. If you're an adherent of the Jones Theory you only need to get this one, which is slightly better than Terra Mystica, but not by much as it's better looking, and has the green neutral planets so you're not getting stuck as easily as in TM, but it also has warping boards, replaced money and cubes with a track on the player board and is somehow a lot more expensive.
2017-01-08 : Another rather enjoyable play with a very tight finish and close end-scoring. Approved.

RATING: 8
It's a good game. Better then Terra Mystica? Well... mechanical wise probably, for the rest, no. Yes, it does bring new mechanics and deepens the choices you make... kinda. But with it comes less fighting over space, only 4 players possible, harder to see what you get (because there are now multiple places where you get resources) a less colorfull board/boards and no fighting over the cult tracks.
Also in terra mystica, the races feel more in line with the abilities they have... with gaia project, it feels more like number crunching and fitting the mechanics... maybe also because the races aren't speaking to the imagination as much as the witches, gnomes or giants in Terra Mystica.
And though the terra forming circle is still present in this game, it's not on the player board anymore, which makes it harder to see/keep track of.
And although I sum up a few of the changes that are made... the game actually is a bit too much like terra mystica still and I really don't need 2 of the same kind of games in my collection, so I don't see myself buying this one any time soon.
It's a good game, but I'll keep at it with terra mystica a little bit longer.

Gaia Project improves upon the, albiet few, shortcomings of its predecessor, Terra Mystica. Most obviously, the bland Cult tracks and Favor tokens, have been replaced with a fabulous tech tree system, which equips players with various ways to customize their abilities, income, and point scoring methods. However, the biggest improvement is the variable End Game contests. Where Terra Mystica's end game was static and uninteresting, Gaia forces players to compete for new objectives, giving each game a distinct focus. Mix this with the myriad of races, and technology tiles, and players will have a new puzzle to crack with each play. The round scoring tiles are overbearing, but Gaia improves just about everything else.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
A truly stellar upgrade (no pun intended) to the already outstanding Terra Mystica.  

With 14 unique races, variable/modular board set-up, the new research areas and tech tiles, and various other new twists, this game really shines.  And the Automa solitaire system included is quite excellent, serving as the proverbial "icing on the cake" for me.

RATING: 9
Gaia Project has similar mechanics to Terra Mystica, and the comparison is valid.  The subtle differences, however, make for a better game:
-More 'space' means you're not blocked out from expansion(nor are opponents)
-Emphasis on Tech track (instead of cult 'ladder'), improves the game
-The 'power pool' is much more dynamic
-The VP turn bonuses/ end game bonsuses are more of a focus (due to non-blocking)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
After playing this a few times I think it’s safe to say it surpasses TM.  The technology track takes this game to the next level. Compared to the cult track it is infinitely more interesting and actually adds strategy to the game rather than just being a way to move power and get an end game scoring bonus. 

Also, the solo mode is excellent and will allow me to get many more plays with it compared to TM.

I wasn't a fan of Terra Mystica as I found its efficiency treadmill stultifying and boring. Gaia is a much more fun version of TM for me due to the variable endgame VP conditions and the wonderful tech tracks. 

Instead of just going up culture tracks for the sake of scoring, here they're tech tracks that give immediate or income phase benefits and focus your strategy for the game (and who doesn't love a good tech track in a game?).

after repeated plays, i see this game as the perfect step ahead of Terra Mystica, having just enough new mechanics and "in-between" actions to make for a super interesting puzzle. Even more options to achieve your goals than in the original game. 

i think anyone who liked the original, will greatly enjoy this one.

DEC 2017: It's Terra Mystica, first streamlined (goodbye fiddly end-of-round stuff and virtually meaningless cult track), then complicated (hello science and QIC cubes, and randomized techs tied to 6 progress focuses!) and it's basically amazing. Terra Mystica is still great (and tighter), while Gaia Project gives 2p play more interest, and nice ramp-up into expansion and development.

It's like having 14 new factions to play Terra Mystica with, and a better "cult" board full of techs, and a modular map. So does it replace TM? Not in my opinion. GP is good, maybe even better, but they are a bit different, and I plan to keep both for the time being. TM has more content (20 factions, plus the promo stuff), and has tighter map constraints that we really love; GP gives us more wide-open map, but tough tech decisions, and a modular map. And the factions play to the new things going on in GP, which means they aren't really analogous to TM's factions. All the more reason to keep both, I suppose.

TM and GP are both strange: it's obvious they are euros, and they ought to be very dry. And, actually, they are. And yet somehow the theme comes through, probably because of the nature of expansion, the faction differences, and the tight economy.

Played 11 new-to-me games at Bryce-Con 2018.  This was my favorite, (and followed closely by Anachrony, Scythe, and Heaven & Ale.  I also liked the lighter games Photosynthesis, Istanbul, and Lewis & Clark. )
I had played Terra Mystica once so understood the concept.  This is a much better game.  The different factions are so well designed and add so much playability to the game.  Very impressed with the creativeness of the designers.  The improved research tracks are much better designed--give rewards at every level and are more meaningful to advance upon now.  The player's board look very similar to Terra Mystica so it is easy to slide into this game.

RATING: 9.5
The same tight system as Terra Mystica with a new theme and a few improvements. The different parts of the game come together as a whole better in this game than in Terra Mystica. The plastic pieces fit the theme well and everything is very well produced.

I love the puzzle this game offers in each round. The rules seem intimidating at first, but once you know how to play it it's really not that bad. The game even flows pretty good for the heavy decisions everyone has to make.

It doesn't replace Terra Mystica for me, but it stands shoulder to shoulder with it.

RATING: 10
I didn't like Terra Mystica mostly because of the look & feel, the boring fantasy theme/take, the cult tracks (too uncorrelated with the rest of the game).

I found Gaia Project much more appealing to me because of the Sci-Fi background/take, the clean-shinny look & feel, the modular board but more than anything, the tech tracks. I really like the few other things like Transdim/Gaia Project and QIC.

"Terra Mystica in space" very much describes Gaia Project. Both games are pretty close mechanically, so close, in fact, that I don't think there is a need to own both unless you are a die-hard fan who just has to have everything. Probably the most important change from Terra Mystica is that the ex-cult tracks have been transformed into technology tracks that allow the people of the galaxy to develop in very different directions in addition to the racial advantages that still exist. These make Gaia Project the slightly more complex (and certainly the messier looking) game. It is just as challenging, however.

RATING: 10
GAIA PROJECT ist TERRA MYSTICA einerseits für diejenigen, die TM durchdrungen haben und in neue Welten aufbrechen wollen. Andererseits werden auch Spieler, denen TM zu unerbittlich war ihre Freude an dem neuen Projekt des sympathischen Helge Ostertag und seinem Kompagnon haben. Dabei wurde TM nicht einfach nur 1:1 ins All geschossen, sondern zu einem alternativen Spiel terraformt und die Grundidee mit neuen Zutaten aus der Bordküche des Raumschiffs garniert: Ideen, Ebenen, Ressourcen, Variablen. Zu dem aus TM bekannten knappen Ressourcenmanagement und den asymmetrischen Völkerspezifikationen fühlt sich GP freiräumlicher, breiter, optionaler, aber auch komplexer an als sein Bruder auf der Erde. Das liegt vor allem an dem neuen Fortschrittstableau, das die Kultleisten ersetzt und nun mit mehreren Leisten zum Ausprobieren von Wegen und Möglichkeiten im Gaia-Universum einlädt und innerhalb eines Volksvorteils diesen nun auf dem Fortschrittstableau auch unterschiedlich interpretieren und tunen lässt. GP ist etwas gelungen, was eigentlich gar nicht geht: die Vervollkommnung eines perfekten Spiels. Im Gegensatz zu TERRA MYSTICA ist GAIA PROJECT jedoch auch zu zweit ein packendes Abenteuer. Das Artwork von Dennis Lohausen ist preisverdächtig beim Art Directors Club und verleiht dem Spiel wunderbar viel Flair für eine um Grunde visuell langweilige Planetendarstellung im dunklen All. Mein anfängliches Missfallen über das ameritrashige Plastik, welches das schöne Holz aus TM ersetzt hat, muss ich revidieren: stimmig fügen sich die Figuren in guter Qualität in die gepflegte, farbkompositorisch nahezu perfekte SF-Atmosphäre des Spiels. Dafür sind die All-Legeteile, die ein modulares Spielfeld bauen, verrutschanfällig. GP spielt sich weniger streng, dafür aber eben auch breiter aufgefächert mit mehr Grübelpausen-Dangerzone. Die Fortschrittsleisten sehen aus wie ein Mischpult auf der Kommandobrücke: Technik-Overdose. Die Frage, ob man als Liebhaber der Ostertag-Komposition nun tatsächlich beide Spiele, TM und GP, unbedingt besitzen muss, bleibt natürlich im Raum. Dafür sind sie dann eben doch zu herzblutsverwandt. Aber warum sollte man sich als Herzenspieler in diesem Leben eines von zwei wunderschönen Spielen entsagen.

Squeal to Terra Mystica and this game delivers.  This game is like 80% Terra Mystica and has several new things, all of which improve the game.

The tech board is way more interesting than the cult. More tracks, more in game bonuses from the track. Regular and Advance Tech and a linear scoring system streamlines it a bit (vs 1st, 2nd, 3rd from TM)

The variability is huge right from the start. The new things are more endgame scoring goals, modular boards, advanced techs. The space theme also opens up the board more so people aren't blocked and there are 2 new planet types which are used for Gaia projects (which all races like). Also the new races were playtested by high ranking TM players so they "should" be more balanced

I consider Terra Mystica a perfect game (still only a 9 due to personal preference), so I had high hopes for this game going into it. Playing it has reaffirmed my belief that TM is perfect, because while I thoroughly enjoyed all of the changes that Gaia Project adds, they are merely complications, not necessarily improvements. The tech tree is the big new thing and it's glorious. The old cult tracks in TM are incredibly boring in comparison, there's just so much stuff you can do with the techs! The price you pay is an increase of both complexity in teaching and length of time playing, which I'm not sure is worth it. The other big change is the modularity, which is awesome in theory but I haven't played TM enough to feel like it needs it.

In summary, a great twist on TM that feels very familiar, but still new enough to give veteran players a lot to think about. I'm not sure it's worth it for all but the most hardcore TM fans, especially right now when it's both super pricey and has ridiculous warping boards. Shame on you publishers, for allowing this bad of a production to release!

A cool reimplementation of Terra Mystica. Some things are simpler; some things are more complex. In some ways this is harder to grasp because there are fewer thematic handholds--alien races with weird and novel names don't immediately conjure understanding the way "witches" and "dwarves" do. Still, eager to play this more. Solo mode is a great addition.

EDIT: six games in, I think this is at least as good as Terra Mystica.

EDIT: Played against other players. Yes, it's great.

EDIT: One player remarked that the game doesn't repay its difficulty, and I think that's a fair criticism if you're one and done. To me, this is the kind of game that repays (and really, almost requires) repeated exploration. (I think Terra Mystica has this problem too, although it's less pronounced there.) This isn't so much a problem as it is a "problem."

Played it two times now. It has all the mechanics to be a good game and the overall rating shows it. For me the world and its inhabitants feel a bit lifeless and sterile like a chess board. Somekind of action card system for enhanced interaction between players and with somekind of story text to flesh out the factions is missing for me personally.

None of the four players present in both playthroughs were gripped and like "i want to play again" like in other games like Terraforming Mars. All agreed that Terra Mystica has a better feel to it even though they are rule wise nearly the same and this has clearly improved mechanics.

While this is very much in the vein of Terra Mystica, it plays in a fresh way.  It's not just a sci-fi reskinning.  The most significant change is that the tech tracks (the equivalent of the cult tracks) provide powers and benefits and there are substantial victory point techs that can be won by the first person to reach the top of the tracks.  This adds a major strategy angle to the game, with different strategies associated with the different tracks.  Very fun!

This is Terra Mystica 2.0 with a new theme.

For me a space game wihout battles or some kind of take over is not a real space game.

Money feels a bit strange, it is only used to buy buildings, its not possible to trade money for anything else and in our game money was the resource that all of us hade most of at the end of the game.

Im also missing the planet circle on the playerboards, it made it much harder to keep track of where other players might expand.

The game feels more complex then Terra Mystica, more to keep track of.

But yes, it have alot of good things from Terra Mystica and the tech tree is a nice addition.

I have played some 2-player and solo games, and I am very happy with this game. It improves on Terra Mystica in many ways, most notably the research board and technology tiles, which are are big part of the game. I look forward to trying 4-player games. This seems like it will be very challenging to teach, but I have a feeling it will be well received by folks I typically play with.

The solo game is really compelling and challenging at the higher difficulty levels. I haven't played a game so much since Fields of Arle. Superb!

Multiplayer is excellent -- definitely worthy of a top 10 spot.

Gaia Project does the same to Terra Mystica what Caverna did to Agricola. More strategy, less dealing with what you're dealt. The hardcore gamers will love it. I still prefer Agricola by miles to Caverna and my gut feeling is that I will rather stay with Terra Mystica once the novelty wears off. Although the preference won't be as clear as with Agricola. 

The tech tree is one reason. The development path needs to be factored into the strategy from the start. Beginning one path and shifting midway is a sure-fire way to losing. The cult tracks weren't as punishing. 

Gaia Project ends up with a massive endgame snowball. Optimizing only tactically will leave you unprepared for the final technology / building / alliance / force rush. The need for long-term planning was present in Terra Mystica but failing to do so is more severe in GP. I can't remember a single Terra Mystica game where it was that clear from round 2 that I messed up and there's no way back.

On the other hand, the tech tracks are better integrated into the game than the cult tracks. Board positions are less prone to getting locked in. For now, every faction has the allure of discovery until the new fakirs and giants emerge.

RATING: 6
I suppose I'm in the minority on this one but in comparison to Terra Mystica I found the presentation of Gaia Project to be fairly ugly and its mechanics a little too convoluted. I guess if you could be woken at 4am and start playing Terra Mystica right away, knowing every rule by heart, then the extra level of stuff of Gaia Project isn't much of a problem and maybe it annoys you that the cult track doesn't do that much. But to me Terra Mystica is a much "cleaner" design. I don't want to juggle with all the different science tracks. I don't really care for the extra planet times. The plastic bits are okay but I prefer the wooden components in Terra Mystica. And (imho) Terra Mystica's artwork is far superior. Gaia Project is certainly a good game, probably even a great one. But I'm happy to stick with Terra Mystica.

Gaia project has rich decision making with complex design. The games mechanics interweave for an elegant production that has unbelievable polish. Gaia takes some time to learn, but once you have there wont be any need to check the rulebook. all the rules will begin to make perfect sense. I'm still just a tadpole in a large sea of decisions, but everything makes sense mechanically. Now its just about taking the time to improve my skills. The game is super competitive and the strategy pool seams endless. Every game gives you a new set of challenges to adjust to. My one complaint is that I'm not a big fan of the space civilization concept (the theme is not pasted on), its just not something that interests me. Just my subjective opinion on civilization in general. Other than that Gaia Project does everything masterfully and is a work of brilliance.

Pretty much replaces Terra Mystica for me, the original is still a great game that I'll play any time, but I don’t think I would request it over Gaia Project. This new version features many of the same mechanisms but improves aspects of the game, the variable map is great and the tech tree is well integrated into the gameplay, combining the favour tiles and cult track of Terra Mystica. But above all it’s the flexibility of the gameplay of Gaia Project that’s great, that factions are distinct but they don't shoehorn you into a particular strategy.

Early rating after my first play (2 player). Note: I am an Terra Mystica veteran.

Why no early 10? 
- The variability might be a bit too much for those people that play it the first, second, third, fourth time. It's really an expert's game that shines with a knowledgeable group. Having such variability on scoring and techs might cause serious AP with race selection.
- I hope BalTak, Firaks, Gleen are able to perform. Only read rules and hope we have no "Fakirs/Auren/Giants" issue where it's crystalclear which race is chosen for their colors: the other one. Geods, Xenos, Mad Androids seem to be better.
- Graphics ;) I like Denis Lohausen, but maybe not for this theme

Other than that, the game looks quite perfect to me. Streamlined rules while adding the Gaia stuff as an additional strategy to expand. Tech is agreeable better than cults, even though I miss priests (But QICs are neat looking and enable flexible tactics).

Streamlined stuff: connectivity for endgame, resource fiddliness, all races with the same building costs, no coins on bonus tiles, etc.

I like it quite much!

Update: Digged a little bit deeper and I am more satisfied. Upped my rating. Wrote a strategy post ;)

Hevijurókból talán tényleg a csúcs számomra. Nem a kedvenc kategóriám amúgy, jobban élvezem az ennél könnyedebb játékokat, de nagyon összeállt ez. Persze Terra Mystica alapra építeni amúgy sem volt rossz ötlet, szóval majdnem biztosra mentek a tervezők, de ettől függetlenül is tényleg nagyon jóra sikeredett. Az egyetlen hátránya, hogy kicsit nehéz elképzelnem, hogy innentől kezdve miért Terra Mysticáznék. :(

Terra Mystica reskin with a few new elements some good, some not so much. The tech track in place of the cult track is better because it gives game bonuses and not just for being about victory points. With that said, I would still rather play Terra Mystica. If you thought Terra Mystica was a kitchen sink point salad then this game is a clogged dishwasher. If you didn't like Terra you probably should stay away from this one. If you have the same dedicated game group for this enjoy, but with new players they might be getting some migraines from some of the obtuse mechanics. I'll stick to spading on land rather than colonizing the moon.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

While I can definitely see the influence of Terra Mystica, this one plays a bit differently because of the importance of the "cult" track to score points and build your engine. The different races certainly play differently and encourage different approaches. It is a bit easier to build and get around the map. I think I may like this better than TM.

This game ups the ante over TM in every aspect. There are more options, decision points, and ways to use resources. On top of that, the board is entirely modular as well. Play time was the same as TM, so in the end, I'm not sure (yet) that there is a reason to return to TM other than perhaps theme?

I'm VERY glad this met expectations; which were VERY high.

RATING: 10
After 3 games it does appear to improve upon Terra Mystica quite a bit. Technology tracks are a good addition to the game instead of cult tracks. Improving on each track provides not only points and certain ability improvements, but also grants much needed one time rewards, that help boost your early game. The power play is another important upgrade in my opinion. You start the game with considerably less tokens, however there are so many ways to generate power tokens and power cycles that you use them more often than in Terra Mystica.

Overall, I need to play it more and try different strategies as currently I feel that I've only touched the surface of this game.

RATING: 10
I've been hyped for this game since it was announced and it did not dissapoint. It builds upon the mechanisms of Terra Mystica, so if you're a fan of that game, you are going to pick up the rules of this one more easily, but at the same time there are so many differences between the two that they are very different experiences.

1. The board is modular and it also scales between the lower and higher player counts, which means you get much more variety, especially since all 10 individual boards can be rotated and placed however you like.

2. The Reserach board completely evaporates the cult track from the original. Each track here has an actual game function, like improving your terraforming or navigation, or giving you resources or granting you the ability to "gaiaform" an otherwise uninhabitable planet type. Instead of favour tiles, there are now tech tiles that in addition to giving you income/resources/abilities also sends you up one of the research tracks, as well as advanced tech tiles that you could obtain if you get far enough along on a specific research track. Frankly you are going to be focusing on this board a lot during the game.

3. The more dynamic way "power" works. I really love that you can obtain new power tokens rather easily, and that power has even more uses than in the original. You can still spend power for actions and you can burn power to get the necessary power to spend. But you also use power to "gaiaform" which more or less take those power tokens "out of commission" until after the next income phase. And you discard power tokens whenever you build satelites.

4. The different way terraforming now works. You can no longer partially transform, nor are you changing something into your own territory. And the game even encourages you to colonize different planet types, through powers and scoring tokens that rewards players who spread out between many different planet types instead of focusing on the cheaper transformations.

5. How distance now works. You can count distance through planet hexes and not just through empty space hexes, which completely does away with players blocking one another, as upgraded navigation and or spending of green resource cubes to temporarily boost your reach. You still need space hexes for building satelites when forming federations, but there are so many open space hexes that this is not a problem (especially since you can build satelites on hexes another player has built them on as well. Neighbour bonus is also more forgiving as it now is a distance of two (which makes sence with all the open space).

6. How forming federations is not as restrictive as forming towns. There is no minimum required number of buildings, nor do they have to be close together in order to be joined in a federation. Instead you build as many satelites necessary to connect the planets together (you discard one power token per satelite, so you are still encouraged to keep it to a minimum). Forming a federation is also an action, not something that happens automatically, so you can choose when to do it.

7. Gaiaforming is a really interesting new concept. Not only is there a planet type that all players can colonize at the same cost, there is also a different planet type that is uninhabitable unless you specifically gaiaforms it into an habitable planet. It gives you an alternative to simply upgrading your terraforming ability, and I like that there are different ways to go about expanding.

I cannot say too much about the different factions yet as I have only played the recommended three player starting scenario, but so far I find them interesting and vastly different from the ones in TM. I also like that some of them start out with the first level on a research track.

Component-wise I have to say the plastic pieces are fantastic, a huge upgrade from the wooden shapes of the original. I like that even the pieces that are merely shapes are shiny plastic ones instead. I'm not entirely sold on there being a resource track now instead of individual pieces. I managed just fine, but realize that for some people the tactile part of planning your turn can easily be lost by sliding pieces along a track. There is some unfortunate warping on the cardboard, likely due to high differences in humidity between the production facility and my home. It doesn't seem to be permanent as the board starts warping the other way around if I turn it, and though it was very noticeable it did not affect the gameplay for us.

This game definitely belongs in my top 10. It's too early to say if it will surpass the original, though it defintely holds the potential to do so. It seems to have a much more dynamic player count, while TM is at its best with more players. I'm doubtful I will do the solo play, but I like that it's an option. I really enjoy the changes it brings, aside from the warping issues the components are fantastic. All the variability with set-up, everything from board configurations to tech tiles is just wonderful. It will make games feel really different from one another. Massive thumbs up to this game, I love it!

January '18:  Boy, what a disappointment.  I am a fan of Terra Mystica.  While Terra is a bit convoluted, it plays relatively smoothly and cleanly.  I do not play it nearly enough to have memorized the required starting locations, or have any idea which factions are the ones to choose in order to win.  Gaia is Terra Mystica with enough extra baggage thrown in to bog it down to a slog.  It is brutal if you fall behind: with no way to catch up, you have to pass early while the other players in our game got six or seven extra rounds.  The number of actions players got kept going up and up, and each turn dragged on and on.  The tech track may be a good idea in theory, but it just kept the game going on for more rounds, and exhaserbated the rich-get-richer aspects.  The board is terrible to look at and the artwork hurts gameplay.  The plastic is ugly and generally awful.  The terminology is asanine, and a barrier to learning: quantum intelligence cubes?  Really?  The bonus scores each round unimaginative, the forming of federations needed so much explanation it felt very forced.  I am definitely one who prefers to original.

Like Terra Mystica, this action selection game has all open information style play that I love.
If you liked the previous game you will love this, my reasoning behind:
- Modular playing board adds variability -> choosing the right race can be even more important in this game than in TM (Terra Mystica)
- Scoring tiles for technology reduced to 2 -> No more race for Earth 1, maybe with more plays the scoring tile for building on Gaia planets gets a must, BUT placement of that tile could be in a track that you don’t have any interest in
- variability of races seems even greater than Vanilla TM -> adds to strateg thinking, all races focus in some technology aspect: ignore Gaia planets? Ignore resource track wich could allow build 3 big buildings easier? The most difficult track to ignore is the distance once, although the qic one could be enough, I need more plays

Solo mode is well implemented and challenging for TM veterans with different difficulty levels.
If you like to avoid similar games in your collection and own a copy of TM, I will excuse you for not getting this gem, otherwise it is a must.

Played once, but have many plays of TM.  I like it better than TM, and I rate TM as a 10, so....

I had to bump TM down to a 9.  GP is simply a better game for me.

This games many interrelated mechanisms just makes my mind feel really good while playing it.  This is how TM made me feel when it came out.  We played it to death.  The tech trees in GP are just so much better.  The flexibility in creating federations.  The QIC cubes for expanding one's reach and triggering bonus actions...an improvement in almost every way over TM in my mind.

Oh my! So good a game! It is Terra Mystica with a review mechanism which is simpler and much more efficient: the priest track is now giving technologies for every step. The map changes with every game. I could go on but now, I need to sell away my terra mystica to go buy myself a copy of Gaia Project.

The game forever fated to be called 'Terra Mystica in space'. I like TM, but I find that bolting on a daft sci-fi theme and tweaking a few rules is cynical publishing at best. The current trend of designers 'improving' games for re-release is worrying and illustrates the narrowness of the market sometimes.

I like the game changes compared to Terra Mistica. Modulair board is nice and the changes to power, the faith track and end scoring feel more balanced and lets a player who fell behind get back into the game. (So it is a bit less cutthroat/more forgiving then TM) The races look fun too. 

Dislikes the game bord design which was a bit clustered and I missed the wooden components which are replaced with a resource track.

RATING: 9.3
Only played once so rating is mostly a place-holder. I set it to 9 because that's where Terra Mystica originally 

Initial Thoughts:
- I REALLY like the Technology board/tracks much more than the cult tracks of TM
- Power is far more interesting now, with Gaia transformations and a lot more gaining and discarding of power
- Really wish it was 5 player
- Warped boards are annoying...
- No physical goods for workers/ore and money means it's harder for me to think several actions forward
- The above does mean there are less pieces on the table, which is nice
- A bit more open than TM and some stream-lining means that overall I feel like there is slightly less tension. This is a neutral for me, at this time.

So far, I really enjoy it (as expected, TM being my #1 game). I can't wait to play again and definitely see it potentially surpassing my love of TM. Definitely want an expansion that increases player count to 5!

UPDATE: 3 games in (2p, 3p, 2p)
Most initial thoughts are still accurate. Additionally:
- Really love the uniqueness of each race, I think they are more interesting than TM's races
- The "less tension" point from above stands and I'm going to put it as a slight negative now.
- Can't wait to try out more races and play a 4p game! Upped rating to TM's current rating, as I think they're equally good at the moment.

UPDATE: 7 games in (2/3/2/2/3/2/1)
Still waiting to play a 4p game... I think it will shine best with that count, personally. Finally every race has been played at least once! This is also the first game that I've actually played the Automa with. I thought it was pretty interesting, but ultimately lacks the tension and fun that playing with others has. Still a good addition, obviously better to include it than not.

Current thoughts:
- I'm not sure that Gaia beats out TM for me. I'm not sure that it doesn't, either. Only time will tell...
- I really want to keep playing and playing! I think I'll up the rating a tad, to in between TM and TM+expansion

UPDATE: 8th game played: 4 players
Finally got a 4 player game in and I believe the game is best with this number. It finally felt like there was enough tension, which is my main gripe with 3 and less.

Gaia Project is the sequel to Terra Mystica, but this time with a space theme. As we all know, space is mostly empty, so the game board is arranged a little like an archipelago--most of the hexes are just empty and can't be terraformed, and no more than two of the usable planet hexes are next to one another. To make up for this, there are some modifications to adjacency rules for both gaining power and trading house costs. They also morphed the cult tracks into technology tracks that include things like shovel costs and shipping. The faction powers appear to be somewhat less differentiated in this game, but include more power manipulation abilities like those that are included in Fire & Ice. On the whole, I wouldn't say this game is any better than Terra Mystica, but I'd be happy to play it more to mix things up. The limitation to four players is a bit of a ding here, as Terra Mystica is a game that I enjoy at five.

Terra Mystica in space. This borrows heavily from Terra Mystica, but differs a fair amount. Actually it's different enough that it was a pain in the ass to explain and remember what is and isn't the same. A few major tweaks to the game (how power sharing works, terraforming and most importantly the tech track [cult track]) really bring this system into a new light. No longer are you simply fighting over the cult track for points, but you're actively trying to improve your abilities through it. Less of a point of contention which really makes the game feel different.

I love Terra Mystica (and possibly more than this), but this is a different beast all-together. I love how it scales based on player count which Terra Mystica suffers from. Only time will tell which I prefer more. I'd be happy to play both though and space is definitely a more interesting realm for me.

Wow.  Probably shouldn't comment after the first play but here goes...  My head was swimming.  Read the rules and watched a 90 minute 'how to play' video before putting the game on the table but it was still a serious brain burner.  I want to try it again right now but I'm afraid its weight may have run off the two family members I played with tonight.  So many rules missed at times and discovered later in the game.  I think I can play a clean game now but will I find anyone to play with me?

This is clearly a further developed design of Terra Mystica. It feels cleaner, but also a bit harder and playing time seems to be a bit longer also. The big question is: Do you need to own both? This seems to be the cleaner one, but harder to master if you've never played Terra Mystica before. I also had the feeling that the race you play with really drives you in a certain direction.

This is a space themed points gathering game. Each player gets an asymmetric faction board and has the task of spreading out across the galaxy map with their structures and grabbing technologies with the goal of getting as many points as possible. Each round has a special VP awarding criteria that triggers for a certain activity, and at the end of the game you score for two special overall criteria that get randomly determined at the start of each game.

One thing I really like about this game is that despite being given player powers that push your towards a specific strategy, you still have a lot of freedom of choice as to how you pursue that strategy thanks to the openness of the map since you can always fly through the space hexes and thanks to the way the tech tracks work. The game has one large tech chart with multiple categories, and as you increase levels you get more income or cheaper abilities.

The components are nice, although my player boards are a bit bowed. The iconography is consistent and after about half a game you no longer have to look icons up in the rulebook.

This game if firmly built upon the genius of Terra Mystica. Many of the complaints of Terra Mystica are addressed here: The static board, the mostly detached cult tracks, the general lack of coins, the power economy. All of these things are fixed or improved upon. The addition of a solid solo mode is a welcome addition, as well as being much better at 2 players. 

I personally preferred the "theme" of the first one, but mostly preferred the graphic design and the wooden pieces. The plastic buildings coupled with the new design make the entire package slightly less visually appealing and some of the tactile fun of the original is gone without the wooden buildings and resources. 

However, the actual gameplay leaves me uncertain as to how I feel. There certainly is more to consider, and more variability in the starting set up. One would think these would be welcome improvements that would add to the game experience. Yet my current inclination is that they instead detract from the experience of Terra Mystica. 

Gaia Project offers so much to consider and so many things to do that it is nearly impossible to read the board state. Perhaps additional experience will help improve this (indeed it almost would have to), but does a game need this many decision points to still be extremely interesting and deep? Of course not, as Terra Mystica demonstrates. The chess player in me actually rather likes the fact that openings can be so studied and learned in Terra Mystica--Gaia Project seems like it may be very difficult to ever learn enough to feel confident in making great moves. 

More worrying to me though is actually the variable set up simply creating far too many possibilities, leading to some set ups that vastly favor certain factions. Balancing all the races so that there are always several competitive choices for any set up is probably impossible and likely didn't occur. Terra Mystica has done a great job ultimately in that there are always several factions that should be able to score well and be competitive--indeed top games seem to show that the differences between the top few factions are on the order of only a handful of victory points in almost all set ups. I suspect Gaia Project has no hope of achieving that level of balance because of the much wider starting set ups occasionally offering some factions very great positions. But without tons of data, who will ever know, and I don't think the game lives or dies by its top level balance anyhow. 

My biggest complaint about the game though is oddly the "updated" tech track. While it certainly is integrated more, I actually like it less. To be planning in the game, you constantly have to be referencing your dig values, gaiforming values, navigation values, and income values during various times. Instead of largely being able to plan your game out off of your faction board, you need to be paying attention to your board and the other board. The map is tricky with players able to reach and influence things in many more ways, making it ever harder to predict what may unfold or plan ahead for certain spots. 

Essentially the game feels like it just has too much going on, although I'm sure many feel that way about Terra Mystica. It's not that much more, but for me I don't think it's actually an improvement upon the game. Something about the elegance of Terra Mystica has been lost in this beast. Gaia Project is still a great game and I'll happily play and perhaps in time experience will show the game to be better than I think. But for me I think Terra Mystica is a much more worthy game of heavy analysis and repeated plays, whereas Gaia Project I think simply has too many options and too much variability where it's added more complexity and situations to analyze without really offering a more interesting or deeper experience than Terra Mystica.

Played about 4 times now.

I was skeptical at first, as the game seemed like it had way too much going on.  My head was exploding with the options and trying to find which would result in the most points.

After about 2 plays, it wasn't too hard to pick what to do anymore, and I just relaxed and enjoyed the game.

Pros:
2 hours for 3 people.  Thought it would be much longer, but this doesn't appear to be the case.
Passive competitive play lets almost anyone find this game enjoyable.
Fun for both people who like to plan out their actions and people who just want to do things.

Cons:
Game is overwhelming on the first few plays because of how much stuff is going on.
Upgrade paths are much less linear than Terra Mystica (the game which this one re-implements).
A little lengthy for people who dislike longer games.
Theme, while more apparent than Terra Mystica, is still not bleeding through, and not really that relevant to game play.
Income icons are right next to cost icons on player boards, which makes it hard to easily find them.
Some income is on the research board, which makes keeping track of your totals gains a little bit of a pain.

Although Gaia Project has made minor strides in streamlining its predecessor, it retains the core aspects of Terra Mystica which made it fall flat for me. Granted, there are some people who seem to be drawn to these aspects, so I can see it being a love letter to those gamers. For the unspoiled and uninitiated who are being drawn to the hype, heed these words: commit to this game and all you will get is a soulless button pusher with a few extra dials and knobs buried beneath a lackluster sci-fi-flavored finish.

Furthermore, though I am hopeful future print runs will fix this, it merits a complaint: An $85 admission fee to own a *brand new* game with warping player boards and tiles right out of shrink is inexcusable.

(+) Asymmetric player faction powers will, naturally, lend to more avenues to replay the game and try new strategies (see: exploiting the obvious). There are plenty of factions to choose from, and it seems far too early in the game's life to truly establish a hierarchy of unquestionable "best faction per color". The new modular main board also adds to replay-ability.
(+) There are plenty of proverbial dials, buttons, and levers (oh my!) that players can tune to their liking to further exploit the system. I liked the opportunities the new technology track provides for you as a means to gain income and new abilities. 
(+) The standard growth to points system is tried and true and easy to grasp.

(-) The amount of player interaction remains minimal. "Power" is still handled very much the same, a fleeting resource whose usage may differ but whose distribution is still very much contrived. It exists to give a sense of interaction but utterly falls short of the brinksmanship of other interactive euros. Once more, it incentivizes (see: forces) players to play the diluted area majority game on board, otherwise the game would lack any teeth.
(-) The system presented by the game stymies player creativity, presenting very straightforward goals to net you bonus points. Of course, you are free to ignore these at your own point-delta peril, but I assure you that experienced players most certainly will be (and are) trying to achieve them at every opportunity. Faction powers literally outline your best mode of play and bonus tiles each round are delineating the very actions you should be striving to intertwine among your own goals each turn. The "multiple-ways-to-victory (point)" syndrome is strong and unyielding. 
(-) It *still* possesses watered down area control. It has even *more* of a bloated tweaking and tinkering system. It *still* holds players' hands as to how best to proceed every turn. All this to say, Gaia Project boils down to a rather uninspired excuse for a sequel.

Great game but I feel TM is slightly better.  The game is a bit more simplified than TM but still have enough depth.  The research track is a welcome change but it doesn't feel as competitive as the old cult track.  It feels easier to do things in this game than TM but that's not necessarily a bad thing.  Overall, still a wonderful Euro strategy game!

Loved Terra Mystica and find every one of Gaia Project's innovations an improvement. The tech track in GP is vastly better than the cult track in TM. In the latter, it felt like it was just there at times, whereas in the former, it provides meaningful and hard choices. However, with the overall increase in the number of actions per round, the onset of AP is a bit more likely. Modular boards provide a ton of replayability.

--Dec2017-- A really nice mutation on the Terra Mystica foundation.  The cult tracks (there; now tech tracks) are a bit more thematically integrated; and there's some extra currencies to play with.  It's enough different to want to play both, I think.

This isn't a bad game. It's just not a game that I enjoyed playing. Lots of people enjoy both this game and its predecessor, and more power to them.

Apparently this is a game that you enjoy (and are better at) after multiple repeated plays. I just don't have the time to invest in that, for a game that I didn't enjoy the first time; I have plenty of other games that still have a large degree of decision space left to explore that I enjoy playing a lot more.

If you liked Terra Mystica, you'll like this. If, like me, you didn't, move on.

The title seems apt: A Terra Mystica Game. A lot of the mechanics are the same: Ores are workers; money is always money; knowledge contributes towards the science tracks similar to how a priest contributes towards the cult track; and the power bowl works the same. The dissimilarity is also very prevalent: there's 6 science tracks, hence needing you to either concentrate on a single science track to maximize your earnings, or concentrating on one in order to get to the advance techs. The various new factions and the addition of the Gaia Projects also introduced a new twist to the game, not to mention the range that applies for adjacency as well as the formation of federations. With more play, I think the rating will be much higher than it is right now.

I had heard about this game very early in 2017, but mostly dismissed it as unnecessary. Trying to improve on a masterpiece like Terra Mystica seemed to me a pointless waste of time.

Fast forward to January 18, and I am now forced to admit my original thoughts were completely wrong. This game is quite simply an astounding significant improvement on one of my top 3 board games of all time. How they managed to do it still totally eludes me. Hats off to the designers, you guys have pulled off what I had assumed was impossible. I am somewhat saddened though that Terra is most likely killed for me at this point, but Gaia is amazing, and sufficiently satisfies the same niche in my collection.

In any normal year, this would have been a slam dunk for my game of the year, but 2017 of course was far from normal. Gloomhaven exploded onto the scene, and made a mockery of the otherwise exciting contest for that honor. What a golden age we nerds live in ;)

Amazing sequel to my favorite game of all time, Terra Mystica.

It's more complicated than even Terra Mystica, an already complicated game. This makes it an extreme niche game, not one you can pull out whenever.

That being said, it does have some strengths over Terra Mystica. It has even more replayability built it due to the greater number of randomized factors (including the board itself). The board play also is more interesting and tense as it's kind of like everyone has shipping everywhere so everyone is racing around for the different planets.

Didn't seem any more streamlined than TM (some complexity edited out, some added in).  Still a difficult game to teach.  This is not an "elegant" game.  Once you get the rules down, there are interesting tactical and strategic decisions to be made. 

There doesn't seem to be any particularly over- or underpowered factions (a big problem I have with TM) and the initial board layout seems more variable which makes the choice of factions more interesting.

This is a fantastic heavy Euro game. I have never played Terra Mystica, and never anything as heavy as this. A three-player game takes 3-4 hours to finish.

Naturally, the rules take 30-45 minutes to cover for new players. There is so much replay value to the game; the board is modular, there are 14 difference races, and the bonuses for rounds, endgame, and advancement change every game...to name a few. The game does very well at building a complexity curve. The first round only lasts a few turns given the limited amount of actions available to a player. By the sixth and final round, players are faced with a enough deep choices to keep any player happy. Despite boasting no combat, there is a very surprising of interaction between players as they compete for publicly available actions, planets to colonize, and the set of turn bonuses.

I place an enormous value on theme and aesthetics in a Euro game. While the gameplay of games like Puerto Rico and Castles of Burgandy is solid, the visual aspects and theme of the games lead to a dry experience. Gaia Project has a great theme and acceptable art that keeps me interested for the entirety of the game.

Hmmmm. I love Terra Mystica but I'm not convinced Gaia Project is an improvement. The game has added complexity layered on top which IMO doesn't improve the game or make it more interesting, it just makes it more - random and complex. I found it hard to devise a decent strategy besides just playing to my race's bonus ability. Perhaps a few more plays and it'll all fall together. TBH I think they should have just left Terra Mystica alone as it's already a brilliant game and concentrated on somethign entirely different.

WOW!! This game is just a pure brainburner. Played three 4 player games in a row and everyone loved it. Practically no downtime and very tight rules. We only had a few issues but nothing big. What I like about is the feeling that this is a game of skill and by praticing and playing it you can hone your skills. Theres no luck involved. Normally I don’t like pure euro games too much as it can feel like multiplayer solitaire and that doesn’t appeal to me. But this does not feel that way to me. I’m selling my Terra Mystica as this feels like a perfect upgrade. Great job guys :D

This takes TM and fixes the problems I had with it - 1) theme feels better, 2) You can actually do something on turn 1, 3) the faction specific upgrades have been replaced by a shared technology track which is advanced in multiple ways, 4) End game scoring is clearer and trackable 5) You can't randomly terraform things into different terrains to block in other players 6) Power is more useful

You get the idea!

Very nice follow up to Terra Mystica, retheming the game while incorporating several elements from the Fire & Ice expansion and also doing some streamlining and adding some new stuff:
- coins/workers/priests —> credits/ore/knowledge, and now everything is counted on tracks instead of with tokens
- leeching now has range 2, but only your single biggest building in range can leech
- shipping —> range
- cult tracks now combined with digging/shipping tracks on a central board, with cleaner implementation of key requirement (town bonus tiles now double-sided)
- town —> federation, with simpler rules (7 puts, no other restrictions)
- favor —> technology, now randomly assigned to different tracks (so less associated with specific races)
- simplified Terraforming: mostly all (and build) or none, with New Gaia Project as the only multi step procedure (with its own twist).
- randomized end-game VP criteria (like TM expansion)
- power disc manipulation (gain/loss) included (like with some of the TM expansion races)
- modular board
- new power-type actions using new resource (Quantum Cubes) to activate 

Look forward to trying the other races!

A combination of overpricing and underwhelming visuals make a dangerous cocktail. Plastic material, tacky, psychedelic visuals, 125$ CAN. Sigh.
The game is heavy, which is fine, but actually over-complicated. So many people say that the game is better than the more elegant Terra Mystica because it took the original and added more layers of complexity. The result is a game that far too long (easily 4 hours with 4), clunky and to me, rather unpleasant.

RATING: 10
Terra Mystica has been in my top3 for a while now, so it was impossible not to like this.
The initial setup feels more interesting, probably because the meta in TM is kind of fixed
The races feel more assymetrical than TM and there are more things to think about. It is more complex for sure.
Don't like the theme as much, mermaids and forest-hopping-witches were cooler

This is the game that I wanted Terra Mystica to be. Very smooth and fun. Also, I was skeptical about the plastic components at first but they're actually very nice and chunky.

Rating 10 for now but it might just be the hype speaking. Very likely it'll just settle at 9 if I find something to dislike about it.

Initial impression from a 2-player game is that it's pretty good.  I think the systems make somewhat more sense than Terra Mystica, but it is still lacking in the kind of theme or even mechanic to make you truly invested in your empire.  You are making tactical and strategic choices in order to gain points, and it really feels like it.  That's not a bad thing, exactly, and I'm interested to try it with more than 2.

Fantastic follow-up to one of the greatest games. It takes the best things from Terra Mystica and adds another strategic layer in the research tracks and advanced techs at the same time as it offers a different feel with the new map.

RATING: N/A
Gaia Project was fun. It is VERY similar to Terra Mystica, but has a few tweaks that definitely make it more interesting and thematic in some aspects. The individual factions seem less different overall, but there's a lot more variety in the layout of the bonuses and ways to progress as you play. Gone are Priests and the 4 Element tracks and instead they are replaced with Technology tracks that also combine Terraforming and River technology from base Terra Mystica (so 4+2 for 6 Technology tracks). Instead of Priests you have Knowledge as a new resource which is essentially 1/4th of a Priest (so instead of all or nothing you can build it up). Also, the additional bonuses for each track are randomized each game (instead of the elemental bonuses you get for building a Temple or whatever being the same each game). Additionally, the energy circle cycles are used more as you can gain energy disks as the game progresses (instead of them being removed and never coming back).

Outside of that the other big changes are mainly around how terraforming and expanding works. It is all or nothing now (no steps or actually replacing locations with different types). Expanding to other places to build is harder because almost every location is surrounded by space (water). Finally, the biggest change is in regards to two new terraforming options which are the "Gaia Project" itself. You have a track that gives you Gaia-formers which lets you turn purple planets into green planets using a large amount of energy from any circle, but locking their use for the turn. Then you can then use a rare resource (Q-I-C / Quantum Intelligence Cubes) to settle green planets without needing to terraform using workers. It is interesting because it gives another path to expanding outside of simply basic terraforming with a single technology track (and was how I and Jared expanded while Logan did it the traditional route).

Overall, I think I like it better than Terra Mystica, but not by a huge amount. There could be some problems with how much variety there is that some people just get super lucky in their set up (Logan got lucky where everything on the brown terraforming technology track just worked well for his strategy). However, I think there's enough variety that if one person gets lucky in one spot someone else will get lucky in another.

Definitely want to play it again with a more crazy faction. My faction had a Braincrystal which was placed with the energy disks but when used for energy counted as 3 (so I kept leeching near other players to cycle it around... me and Logan synergized quite well). Jared's faction got bonuses when Gaia-forming and could use the energy spent to Gaia-form for small bonuses. Logan's faction got a jump on the terraforming track and could have gotten bonus knowledge every time he terraformed a new type of location, although despite talking about it a lot and setting up for it early game he abandoned that for a more traditional route.

I won but it was pretty close with me and Logan (I purposely didn't screw him over near the end b/c he missed seeing something). Jared trailed behind despite taking an early lead. There were a few bonuses he missed that I think could have caught him up a lot if he took them.

Very interesting twist on Terra Mystica and one that any fan of Terra Mystica should check out.

RATING: 10
Played about 30 or so games with two players, and a few games with three and four players.

This is improved in almost all ways compared to Terra Mystica, and we have been playing it non-stop since we got it.

First it is a lot of fun to set up the game and start thinking about what you want to do when you see the setup. Which faction would you like to be? Which technology-track looks interesting to focus on? It changes each game and is always a fun puzzle.

Then it is a lot of fun to play the game and see if you can make your plan work. Many times it does not work, but that is probably because you realized there was some other sweet thing you could do, and you ran off after it like a dog chaising a ball. When you do make your plan work, it is an amazing feeling, and highly rewarding.

After the game you would like to play it over again, just to see if it would be better to do something else.

Compared to Terra Mystica, this game has:
- Flexible Map, a big upgrade
- The favor tiles (now called technologies) are not related to a fixed track any more, which is also a big upgrade.
- It feels like there is a better balance for how you should upgrade your buildings early. In Terra Mystica you almost always should go for a temple first, but I don't think this is the case in Gaia
- Better rewards for upgrading versus expanding. Both might work.
- Better for two players!
- Even higher replayability, which is crazy given how replayable Terra was.

The only negative thing I can find is that Gaia is a bit more complex than Terra. It takes a few plays to get used to some mechanics, but once you do it feels natural and you don't have to think about it too much. Most of the brainpower is used for tactical and strategical planning. It is however not always easy to remember giving yourselves points for stuff (I forget it sometimes), and it is also some work involved in the income-phase, as you have to check a lot of places to see your income. This is a bit annoying, but you learn how to do it and it does not distract too much from the fun parts.

Almost identical to Terra Mystica. I don't like the space theme as much though. It offers even more choices and strategies than TM. But this doesn't make the game better. It becomes too complex and it doesn't play well at all unless all participants are experienced players. It becomes slow and boring. Would have been a better game with fewer things to consider.

Similar to TM which is my favourite game. The two player game is superior due to the adjustable space tiles and a smaller overall board. Terra Mystica is my only 10, this I'm giving a 9 for now but the finalized version will likely be higher.

tl;dr: the same, but different

Yeah, I know, everyone is asking how different this game is to [thing=120677][/thing]. I had the same question. A lot of it is very similar. But some things are significantly different. The 4 temple tracks are gone, and replaced with 6 technology tracks that give you benefits that are not to be ignored. The question is which ones to invest on.
An other big thing is that there is A LOT more 'water' in this game, and that changes the game in a way that should not be underestimated. Most races can do pretty well in Terra Mystica without ever investing in ships. In this game that will be hard to pull off.
An other big change is that there now are ways to gain extra purple disks that can enter the game in specific ways.
Oh, and there's more changes: you can not partially terraform. There are no tiles to do so, so you just pay the entire cost in one go and plop down your building.
And of course there's the Gaia Project part of the game: a new type of 'landscape' (planet) that doesn't 'belong' to any race that has to be terraformed with a new type of resource.
So you see, there's quite a few changes, most of them quite interesting and well integrated into the system we know and love.
Is this game (not) as good/better? I don't know. I really like the new elements a lot. One play is not enough to say, but they might help me enjoy this more. But it certainly is a very good game. Maybe better, but probably as good.
Do you need to own both? Dunno, that's for you to decide. I don't know yet, after one play.
One point on the components: I understand why they went with plastic bits for the buildings and such, but why oh why are the cubes and cylinders also in (ugly shiny) plastic? For this price they could have made those from some nice wood, as it should be.

Initial rating: 8/10

I never got into Terra Mystica. Perhaps I was exposed to it too early in my gaming life to appreciate the intricate complexities of the game. 

Regardless, Gaia Project has caused me to re-evaluate. This is a deep, complex, rich Euro. Equally relevant: Gaia Project improves upon Terra Mystica in some key ways.

The tech track feels totally integrated into the game, unlike the cults track which I've always taken TM to task over for feeling tacked on.

This game somehow elevates the resource conversion engine-builder to a higher plane.

The modular board creates an excellent 2p experience, along with legions of maps.

Like TtA, this is a game I want to work toward mastery. It is incredible.

an improved "Terra Mystica" in space
some things better, some things worse
still overly complex for what it wants to do
interesting races (that aren't just copies from TM races)

Plastic pieces suck (no matter if they fit the Sci-Fi theme better or not).
I don't like the look of the board and "Gaia Project" in general doesn't have the visual appeal that "Terra Mystica" has.

in short:
+ partly improved over "Terra Mystica"
+ many races with different properties
+ round tiles and bonus tiles make you think a little bit differently every game
0 luck-free strategy (not sure if I really like that)
- overly complex(!)
- not enough player interaction
- doesn't look good(!)
- very expensive
- not really fun(!) ?

First play impression: overall this is not as good as Terra Mystica, but it's still a great game on its own.

A few things that are worse than Terra Mystica:

The board. In Terra Mystica you just choose which board to use and you're ready to go. Gaia Project uses a series of tiles that take longer to setup and offer little in terms of gameplay value. It's variable setup just for the sake of variable setup.

The overall look of the game. Everything is just black. Unless you prefer the space theme, then the colorful look of Terra Mystica is much better.

The technology board can be hard to see by everyone at the table. In my one play so far, players had to keep asking what they would gain from the next step because they couldn't see across the table.

The factions felt less asymmetric. Most of them just have a slightly different starting resource and then a special ability. In Terra Mystica every faction has different starting resources, special abilities, different building costs, etc.

The purple planets (I forgot the game term) add needless fiddliness to the game. There's a whole extra phase and a bunch of rules for them and they only end up having a minimal effect on the game.

Power is more fiddly now. Instead of just gaining and using power, now you can additionally totally add and remove power from your bowls. This doesn't seem to add anything to the game versus simply gaining and spending power.

The good:

The player components are really nice. Terra Mystica just used Catan pieces, but Gaia Project has nice custom plastic pieces.

Better for lower player counts. I consider Terra Mystica to be a 4-5 player game only, but I could see Gaia Project working well with 3. In Terra Mystica you need enough competition on both the board and the cult tracks, but in Gaia Project the cult tracks no longer give points based on players' relative positions so the main competition is just on the board.

Variable end-game scoring. Terra Mystic added this in the expansion, but now Gaia Project has it right from the beginning.

Streamlined terraforming rules. In Gaia Project you can no longer partially transform a space, so that helps to keep things simple and easier to explain.

Because I prefer the theme and the overall gameplay is stronger, Terra Mystica is still my choice. But despite the nitpicky criticisms above, Gaia Project still has that great Terra Mystica feel and I'll gladly play it any time. It's just a weird product considering it doesn't strive to improve on Terra Mystica, but only to offer a similar experience.

Seems like it may be a slight improvement on Terra Mystica, but I have limited plays of each so can't really say. 

But when I play either (and this in particular) my brain is taxed on every decision and I'm really terrible at figuring out any semblance of strategy. It seems a well designed game, but just overly complicated for me. The game also took four hours (at 4p) which is a negative for me. I imagine time would decrease slightly after repeated plays, but do I really want to play several more times to get to that point?

Wish it was a little more different than Terra Mystica so that I could justify owning both.  There's a lot of really neat stuff that Gaia Project adds... but I still find myself missing the tension in Terra Mystica.  I like the fight over territory, I like the constant tension of pushing the cult tracks to get on top.  I like the constant pressure to make the best and biggest city.  Gaia Project lessens that direct competition some, but adds some really neat tech and more opportunities to do cool stuff with energy/mana.

This game is a heavy brain-burner optimisation game and very far from the gateway category of euro-games. Even for a quite experienced gamer like myself the Terra Mystica family of games did not open up immediately. My initial ratings were in the class of 5-6... But then that changed, after a few plays your eyes open up and you start understanding the game and suddenly we have a real winner. Extra credit for the fact that you rarely have to reference the rulebook after the first few plays since the rules are relatively simple, clear and have no exceptions(apart from faction powers).

Right now for me this is the number 1 heavy euro of all times and will probably stay there for a long time in my books. This is the game that should sit on the BGG rank 1 if you ask me. Terra Mystica was already a solid 10 and GP clearly improves the concept far beyond what it was. This comes at a small cost of increased complexity and gametime compared to Terra Mystica but the content and possible paths to take will simply always tip the scale in GP favor when selecting between GP and TM.
Before getting this I was skeptical, the pictures look downright ugly and give a cheapish feel for the game. Luckily the pictures don't do this game justice, the components feel "expensive" and sturdy and look great in reality, the plastic in particular. At the beginning there was a slight warping problem but it has resolved with time as the game has settled to the humidity.

After just a few plays, it feels rash to call Gaia Project better than Terra Mystica- I've played the latter well over 100 times and it's one of my favorite games. Yet, everything in GP that's different from TM feels like an improvement. I was particularly impressed with the interactive tension of my recent 2p game, which made me realize that contrary to my initial impression there might actually be more interaction here than in TM. The variability of setup is just through the roof, making GP arguably the quintessential strategic Euro game. I can't wait to explore the hell out of this one! UPDATE: 10+ plays in and I can give this a 10 without hesitation. Most of my plays have been with 2 and I must say I've enjoyed it at that player count the most; I think 4p might be a bit too much stuff to keep track of actually.

Game is Terra Mystica 1.1, thus a sort of rule update. I waited to get the game used at half price because i think that its unethic to buy a slightly updated game with material and artoword (AW were already quite bad on TM) Downgrade for 85 euros... Terraforming Mars was bad Q/P but GP is on a new Whole level. I don't care if games have minis or anything but i want a fair price. After some games (even with TM and GP veterans) i have to say i fear some balancing issues... Science right branch seems a little too powerful point wise as a strategy unless some particular random bonus changes the game...moreso science based races.. ( i won my first 2 games against veterans with science). Solid Eurogame though but beware of the awful production and excessive price.

Very good game, though compared to my all time favourite Terra Mystica, this one does not make it. There are certainly a lot of advantages like more flexible layout and more flexibility in general, also the thematic approach on the former cult tracks is good.

Though, Terra Mystica is such an elegant game whereas Project Gaia is much more complex and fiddly. I can understand why and how the designers changed the game to achieve the pros. But they bought them with a lot of cons:

-The cult tacks from TM might have been a bit dull and that's why the technologies got integrated here in PG, which means the upgrades (shoveling and seafaring) plus some extra thingies to make it interesting. Leading to more complex decisions in general, plus the fact that if you want to cross distances, you need to evolve THAT track. Of course, to stay flexible the QICs were invented. But for just crossing distances they would have been too boring and that's why there is a whole new action set mechanism around them.
-Same thing with gaiaformers, seems to be interesting to generate an advantage there on the skill track and therefore a complete new mechanism (including an extra power space) was created around them.
-Leeching power over 2 spades also is much more hard to read who gets some power now.
-There are much more locations where possible income can come from. 
-Every player has a resource track now, so it is not possible anymore to build small stacks of resources of what you want to build as it was in TM (and every player did that naturally).
-Building cities (alliances) over distances is neat on the one hand, but also leaded to absurd numbers of satellites and really weird and complex alliance building when the satellite scoring tile was active.
-Try not to explain Project Gaia to beginners. Explaining TM already is tough sometimes, Project Gaia left some exploded heads. Which means the mechanisms which make PG less punishing for beginners than TM don't pay out because beginners already capitulate before you even started playing. ;)

All the integration of these extra mechanisms makes Project Gaia interesting on the one side and MUCH more complex on the other side - thus for me less attractive to play. TM created this satisfactionary feeling of 'I figured out the next three turns, lets do it and see how it works out' whereas Project Gaia rather feels like 'I might have figured out the next three turns, but on the next turn already I have discovered three other possibilities of how to get something out of my strategy'. This extends play- and thinking time for every player a LOT and it feels more like playing chess.

What's left? 
Project Gaia is a great game which supports a lot of highly rewarding mechanisms such as the asymmetric layout and factions, receiving more income the more you build and comparable high scores. Also it made me think a lot why and how it is like it is. But it's not even close to TM in terms of streamlining and elegance. Would have rather liked a new expansion for TM with a few new factions, the two new boards and slightly more thematic cult tracks.

But it seems like everybody has his own cup of tea. ;)

Initial rating...only played once but makes me glad that I sold off my copy of Terra Mystica and its expansion.  This does everything better than Terra Mystica with the exception of one, maybe two things.  The things I miss from Terra are the bonuses you got after the round was over for meeting a goal on the current round tile.  This game does not have that which is a bummer.  Also, I like how the navigation system works and the satellite system too but the rivers were used differently in Terra Mystica and in some ways I miss how they were used but I think I mostly prefer the new system overall.  Kind of unsure as of now. 

I love the new advanced technology tiles but wish more weren't tied so closely to points and gave you some type of cool special action or just flat out ability.  I think this would improve on Gaia.  

Overall though, I would always play this over Terra Mystica though.

Bad component quality, extra rules with respect to TM without adding any depth, unbalanced races, complete waste of money, stick to TM.

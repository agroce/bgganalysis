Pretty cute worker placement game, with a nice positional element to it for the order in which you'll place your Vikings to take actions. Add to that the possibilities for betting on departing ship majorities, and also the ability to mess with all the boat pieces, and it's a little more confrontational and thinky than I would have thought. But these are VIKINGS after all! At any rate, a good way to introduce people to the basic concepts of worker placement, and still fun if you already know them and want a lighter experience.

Last I knew, Vikings used to be plunderers rather than goods carriers: yet theme isn’t your main concern when playing Vikings on Board as the game is so plain boring, pointlessly fiddly and devoid of any fun that your only interest is how long it will still take.

Nicely streamlined worker placement Euro. We played 4-players which seemed the right #, I don't know that this would be as good with less. Lots of interactive chances to mess with opponents, and a clever, great mechanic to keep things moving round to round with no maintenance between rounds. Also, fantastic board and boat quality.

Pour peu que vous suiviez un peu l'actualité ludique, vous vous apercevez qu'il y a des thèmes cycliques. Il y a eu une période Zombie (Zombie15, dead of winter, ...), une période pirate (Black fleet, piratoons, ...). Et bien en ce moment, on est dans la période Vikings ! On a le fameux "A la gloire d'Odin" (Rosenberg powwaa), Raiders of the north sea, blood rage, et maintenant ... Viking on board. Les vikings, avant leur étiquette hollywoodienne de pilleurs sanguinaires sont un peuple extrêmement organisé. Avant un pillage, il faut se préparer et surtout ... prendre la bonne place sur le drakkar ! Être celui qui a le plus de vikings de son clan sur le pont afin de pouvoir partir pour la gloire d'Odin. Placez vos vikings dans ce jeu de pose de vikings, fourbe et opportuniste. Avec un peu de manque de contrôle à 4...

Pour 2 à 4 vikings pour des parties de 40 minutes.

Vikings on Board is a family-strategy/worker-placement game in which your objective is to set sail with your clan of Vikings on board the ships best supplied for a successful voyage, while simultaneously placing bets on which clan you think will control each ship as they set sail.

Nicely designed.
Like seeing more games like this from Blue Orange
True to mission, it's quick to learn and not complex.
Some choices feel more like a gamble vs  skill -
sort of try a few things and watch your fate unfold.
Could imagine younger players enjoying this.

Based on the back of the box, it didn't look like something I would enjoy, but later someone else had it and wanted to play, so I gave it a whirl.  It was very mediocre.  There were some clever things to try, but I never found it very engaging.  The play is highly chaotic, but not in Vikingly way.  Moving pieces of ships around is just nonsensical.  The "side bets" for who would win a ship provided some neat incentives.  Still, in the end, I won the 4P game, but didn't find myself caring.  I do not expect to play again, but I would if someone really wanted to.

Despite an excellent explanation of the game from the team at Essen 2016, this was a boring game that just seemed to drag on. It seems there is very little control over which ship sails and who wins it due to having just the 2 actions per turn, and it's too easy to effectively kick someone out of the game by sailing their ships away. The betting aspect seems broken unless it was possible to move someone else's token.

Based off first play only. Seems to have many things in common with my favorite game medina. Have is very open and simple, but also mean and unforgiving. I think it's very very easy for new players to get screwed in this game but i enjoy a tight mean game like this and like medina. Not sure this will play as well at other player counts but I'm hopeful.

Was quite surprised at the amount of strategy in the game. I bought it for my niece and nephews and while they grasped the strategy in it pretty easily, I can easily see this being played by adults who love deep strategy. However, it is definitely a 'take that' type of game so if you don't like cut throat, this game is not for you.

This actually wasn't too bad. I enjoyed my one play of it, though I have no desire to play again. The components and overall appearance of the game make this a bit more enjoyable than it would be otherwise, but I still felt like this was a game of constant setbacks. Just when you think you have a boat set up the way you want it, someone comes along and screws with your plans. This game is the equivalent of building a sandcastle, except that someone comes along and kicks it over on a regular basis. So...yeah. Not really that fun.

So very much wanted to enjoy this one. Awesome bits and cool idea. I put it in line with Camel Up for weight of the game. I would rather play Camel Up, however. very light and definitely a family game. I am sure it will go over well for many but for me it was just boring and the luck of where the boats start was a bit bothersome to me and needs to be fixed. For me it is not a game I have to revisit.

RATING: 5
Very generic game. The graphic design was well done and the components are great, but the game itself just fell flat. I didn't feel like I had enough control over the game to get attached to the outcome of any actions, making the player interaction unexciting and the game not tense enough.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
An underrated gem - the rating is much lower than what it deserves.

Beautiful production values. The mechanics are light but the decisions are tough. An interesting mix of worker placement, area control, betting, and spite. Very confrontational and cut throat. I really enjoy how turn order is determined by your actions - as the action is more powerful, the later your turn will be the following round. Reminiscent of [b]Imhotep[/b] with the aspect of setting sail to ships as both an action of securing points but also a way to cut an opponent short. 

Minor quibbles - AP can be an issue for some players and the strategy isn't apparent until one complete play-through (as with most games).

Played a single 4-player game. I really thought I would like this, but it fell very flat. I did not enjoy trying to scrounge for the very few points available just to see them easily taken away by any one of your opponents later in the round. I've only played once, but it seems as though the game will play out almost the same each time. Similar, but better games: Manila, Camel Up, Mission: Red Planet.

I played another UK Expo game 'Vikings On Board'  where players race to build a finite number of longships to begin a voyage carrying goods to distant lands. Victory points are based around being the first to 'lay the keel' of a ship and launch it as the game pieces are individual parts of ships that must be assembled from the bow to the stern. Players utilise their craftsmen to perform certain functions involving certain key tasks such as swapping longship sections within an existing structure or from an entirely different longship. Having the nearer section to the bow means that player will receive more victory points from the goods carries, and if there are sufficient items aboard, additional goods are shared with the other players, although not equally. It is a race to the top after all. Players may also use their craftsmen pieces to enhance the value of the three types of trade goods - furs, iron and wheat - as well as selecting an option giving them first choice. Knowing how to manipulate the optimum of these is key to winning the game. Another tactic is to launch longships with as many 'coloured' sections of the other players so as to minimise the victory points opponents may receive. The components are excellent, and my only criticism, is that I believe the game would be even better if there was either combat involved or at least a means - perhaps card driven - to scupper your opponents rather than simply selecting an option(s) ahead of them.the number of playing pieces - craftsmen - and ship sections varies according to the number of players. Easily playable within half to three quarters of an hour, Excellent components which require self assembly. The playing pieces would be easy to paint as well.

Cooperativo jugado en solitario siempre. Un vicio de partidas... cuando empiezas, lo normal es que juegues varias. Extremadamente dificil de ganar, quizá demasiado azar en la mecánica de extracción de cubitos. Muy temático y divertido.

Excellent solo game. It’s welcome in my collection as a lightweight game with the right amount of pressure and stress for a nice evening. I have enough heavy games when i want to burn some brain capacity. This one is not one of those. Love the feel and smoothness of the gameplay.

RATING: 7
I prefer a game that has definite win or lose aspect. However, playing alone or with another person will likely prove a similar but perhaps deeper game comparison to Solitaire the card game. I would consider this to be a light thinker/social game which some will love and some will not.

This game has really fallen flat for us. I like the idea of the cube cup and enrichment, but the game really lacks any type of tension and overstays its welcome. We have easily beaten it in our plays and we never felt on the cusp of losing. There isn't enough to the game to build on the cube mechanic, and the game actually overstays its welcome. Not a coop game I will be reaching for and one I will look to move along. Update: Sold

Mierda de componentes, espero que el juego esté bien porque no es normal con lo caro que vale que traiga un cacho de papel como tablero.
El juego mola pero tiene un importante factor de azar aunque tiene mecanismos para mitigarlo. El principal problema que le veo es que el reglamento deja mucho sin resolver por lo que las FAQs se vuelven imprescindibles.

Amazing game. Your resources are stretched thin and you have to do the best you have with what you have. Really neat game design as you attempt to manage the probability of the draw bag and make sure everything is just right in the hospital.

Finally played through a full game. Liked it quite a bit. Good change from my usual repertoire. 

update: This is really growing on me. I dig the cube draw.

Great coop game, with a unique theme. Love the efficiency in components. The board is a bit flimsy, but I love the wooden tokens. Drawing the cubes feels very exciting, even more so than drawing cards.

Great idea, fun theming especially with characters, interesting ideas for some of the mechanics, but there is too much inexplicable randomness and odd fiddliness in the mechanics that do not always connect well with the thematic actions // you are also often wedged into choices that you don't really have control over

Nice, tense, coop game. The game shine with the cube cup and making decision on which patients to treat based on likelihood of pulling the appropriate cubes. The hospital theme worked perfectly.

This is a very solid coop game. Don't let the box art and packaging fool you. You never know what's going to happen each round and you're constantly on the edge of your seat.

I love the idea of this game, and I was really excited to play it. Unfortunately, Healthy Heart Hospital isn’t what I hoped it would be. It’s far too random for me to enjoy, and I don’t feel like I’m in control. In other words, my choices didn't matter. 

At first, we didn’t notice it as much. After each game, though, this fact stood out more and more.

There are a few good ideas here, but I'm not interesting in performing reconstructive surgery to get it functioning the way it should.

Note: I only started tracking in January of 2017, so please ignore the play count.

Only played once so far but I felt the theme and for me that is important in a game like this. Yes there is a loy of cube drawing going on and some upkeep. But it didn't bother me too much during my play, if not at all. Look forward to playing again. I would play this with 1 or 2, maybe 3, but more people would be too much for this game imho.

[url=http://fortressat.com/articles-analysis/2767-idiots]Cooperative games are not games, they are puzzles. And whether I win or lose against a random inanimate/unintelligent algorithm, I am left feeling unsatisfied. I'd rather play a One versus All or a Team versus Team game. [/url]

You and your cohorts have staged a coup at a failing hospital. It is up to you to turn it into a success or possibly condemning it for closure.

Fun theme where patients pour into the hospital every turn as you struggle to keep most alive and hide the bodies of those who have died. See if you can keep this hospital afloat in a town full of medical disasters.

Seems to play best at 1-3 as more players kind of thins down the amount of things you get to do.

I have only played this coop game solo, but I'd say that this is a fun, challenging game with many decisions to make in a fast-changing hospital setting. Whom do you admit, whom do you treat first with which doctor, and where?  Which doctor do you train in which specialty?  When do you build additional treatment areas?  These and many more questions will confront you in your bid to get HHH back on track as a successful hospital.  It's really quite a balancing act to win the prestige and income to pull it off. 

My only fault with the game is that the rules could have been a little more thoroughly developed.  In too many instances, the rules seem vague or even contradictory.  Also, each Training Marker needs to have a full explanation given in the rule book, including how and when they can be used, similar to the way the Now Hiring markers have been explained.

I REALLY want to like this, but my first play left me pretty unimpressed.  Tons out output randomness thru countless cube pulls... my first impression is that it's very random and a bit laborious.

Really great solo game that's a cross between Pandemic (keeping diseases under control) and a business game (paying to expand your hospital's facilities). Brilliant use of cubes to determine patients' level of sickness and recovery. Great 50s artwork and black, sardonic sense of humour. 2e comes with mounted board but I prefer 1e with a paper board more in keeping with the down-at-heel hospital you're taking on. Also have from VPG Infection: Humanity's Last Gasp.

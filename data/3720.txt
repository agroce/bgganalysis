Bought the very first set of soccer teams back in 1974 in England (yeah, right there, where soccer still is called football!). Took it over from there to Germany and into school where we started large soccer-tournaments (even some teachers wanted to play!)!! - Fun to play, and TMHO best soccer game around!!!

RATING: 7
Lost track of the number of times I played this through the 60s, 70s and 80s!! Collected lots of the teams over the years plus assorted extras, (photographers, broadcast crew, ref & linesmen, scoreboard), most of them are still with me.
As well as games with family & friends I had my own solo league writing the scores in an exercise book.
Happy days!!

It's a classic.  What more can you say.  Fiddly yes, but generations of English kids have had and will have a lot of fun with this.  It's also good to collect a few spare teams or even paint your own.  There are lots of accessories to help the atmosphere, too.  There have been many good football games, but this is one of the best.  Just flick to kick!

Football game that occupied many a day in my childhood in 1960's. We played leagues, World cups. We had over 20 teams, floodlights, special goalkeepers, throw in players and cornertakers(first collectible game system?). It was wonderful then, but, computer games cover the topic so much better. It also removes the need for your brother to score to stop you winning the league (bitter, not me) or your sisters/pets to stand on the players.

A fantastic blend of dexterity challenges and strategic game play.  Sorta takes a billiards approach to soccer.  

Subbuteo has a unique feel to it due in large part to the tempo of the game which goes from slow and thoughtful to fast and frantic and a moments notice.

I truly love this game.  As a soccer simulation, it is awesome.  You can play very tactically, despite the dexterity game nature.  It's fun to collect (and paint!) diff teams.

Owned since Xmas 1974.
On that same day, the Youngest sister decimated half the Brazilian team and a couple of England players due to running into my room to look out my window for visitors.
I had set up my pitch on the floor, out of the way, so no-one would tread on anything...
Sometimes the pain is too hard to let go of... :)

Have fudged plays over a time period to one date to get approximate plays up-to-date.

Such a nice dexterity games.
Must be amongst the best there is.
Such a good mix between dexterity, tactics and even luck. 

It will for sure be on my top list for dexterity games.
Get one if you can.
My son also likes it a lot. Plays frequently with his friends.

Will probably get a higher rating after more plays, and when my dexterity gets higher in the game.

very,very nice game could be very expensive if you collect team and all item of this world.not very realistic with fistf rules.fun ,all is in the dexterity of your fingers. difficult to be a correct player. necessite long time of play to be a zidane with your finger.use simulation rules (see subbuteo technical page) because it is not soccer with fistf stupid rules.use house rules for example 4 flicks and not 3 with the same player or more positioonal flicks in order  to make the game more easy for beginners or occasional players

I've played two full games of this thus far. It took me a long time to get the felt mounted and a board built. The game play was fun and tense, but we were all newbies. We had to stop the clock on numerous occassions for rules clarification. I suspect that once I get the rules down, and have a few games under my belt, and find an opponent that understands the rules, this will be an absolute winner.

A good dexterity game for soccer fans. I owned it in my youth but because I'd acquired it piecemeal I didn't have the rules. My only opponent (a self-proclaimed rules expert) obviously made up rulings as he went along to benefit himself so I never really enjoyed playing.

RATING: 8
How many memories!
I've played it so a lot of time but i've never reached a good pratice. I love this game, the way it takes you to the limits when you make a counterattack and have to pass the ball exactly at 3 mm to you striker, but the ball slips away an inch too much...... :-)
Best game play i had were with four guys, two in each team,and everyone had to manage or the defense or the attack. Middlefield...... a choice

What a gorgeous game. Its so evocative. I can't walk by the table and not want to play. I also like that there is a real-time element, without creating a sense of time pressure.

RATING: 9
In '90s Southern Europe, Subbuteo was a lifestyle game. My generation grew up playing it again and again. It was not a board game for us, but a football simulator. And this is quite accurate. Association football is a sport you cannot really transform into a traditional sports board game. Statistics means little to nothing and this dexterity game managed to capture the feeling of the sport without a single die being rolled, without a card being drawn. As a kid I had to have as many teams as possible, the special edition balls, the special pieces such as corner kick and throw in takers, as well as totally useless stuff like bleachers, scoreboard and cameraman figurines!

Great dexterity sports sim - I played this to death with my cousin when we were younger. We replayed entire world cups - I seem to remember that somehow England always ended up the winners, I guess none of the games ever went to penalties.

I have been meaning to get back into this - must get one of the astro-turf type pitches. I am a little wary that some of the modern style teams available don't have bases that allow you to swerve the players - that was part of the skill.

Subbuteo
I played it first, when I was 10, and it never released me. It's maybe the most phantastic idea for a teamsports simulation game, but it demanded desperately some improvement: So I developed the table hockey game Do-To-Ho.
1. because of the board: now the ball/puck always remains in the game and furthermore you can perform some nice billiards-tricks.
2. because of the ball bearings in the play figures and the puck: now the figures glide better and with more control
3. because of now the attacker has two moves consecutively, but has to wait for the move of the defender, there is less hecticness, but more tactics and teamplay in the game.
(sorry - that's just my subjective opinion)

Subbuteo is certainly the best of the table football games and it looks gorgeous. I still remember the excitement opening my first Subbuteo set over 20 years ago. Now, the slightly threadbare football pitch is upturned on my table to make a good surface for gaming. Subbuteo sadly never played quite as good as it looked. You always seemed to knock the goals sideways when you tried to save a shot. There were always arguments about obstructing your opponent as he rushed around the table for a quick dribble, and players (plastic not real!) inevitably fell off the table and got trodden on. PS. anyone else remember Subbuteo Rugby, Cricket and Angling?

PPS. Oh and btw, it's FOOTBALL, not "soccer"!

Very fun dexterity game. I think it captures the feel of soccer quite well. I like how you can allow the defensive player to flick a player into position, but not actually be required to wait for them to do that. It makes the game feel like it plays more in real time, than turn taking. 20 minutes flies by so quickly during this game!

Bias due to a surge of "A la recherche du temp perdue" (the recovery of lost time).  This is a great dexterity game for those who love the game of football.  Knowledge of football (soccer) is a must.  I love it and can't say enough about going out and buying it.  It's still published but hard to come by in North America.  If you like soccer, even mildly, and like dexterity games this is a must!!!

I've had this since I was a kid growing up in England. Haven't played it in recent memory and can't remember whether or not I enjoyed. Should probably break it out sometime and see, but the setup is a little testy when you have to iron your pitch to get it just right.

Very surprised to even see this scoring this highly on BGG. Sure I can understand some of the comments that say it's about dexterity and it's like a game of pool but based on football. Only problem is I love pool and there is nothing wrong with the game, whereas pool with my brother playing pool on the same table as me at the same time? No thanks.

I think people liking this is far worse than people pushing little miniature warriors around a table, at least they stand back while the other takes his turn. In a day and age where there are computer games that model sport much better what place does this even serve? Better still join a team and play it will keep you fit at the same time.

So far, this is my favorite dexterity game. It needs some serious space and it helps to mount the board but it's an incredible game if you can work it out.

Updated: I've raised the score a little more because of how much I find myself wanting to play it and convince my wife to try it. I'm, currently, working on building a 2/3 size pitch to make it easier to play in our apartment.

Played this a lot in my teens.  Got bought the stands, lights, fans (about a dozen of them anyway), corner flags, etc - the full works, but only really needed the basics.  Great game when played with the full official rules, but many house variations.  Fond memories playing on different carpets to get some home advantage, arguing over the legality of flicking styles and glueing players back into their base after your mum had trodden on your centre forward.

This is a U.S. version of Subbuteo made for the 1994 World Cup.  All pieces are included and in good shape with the exception of one of the six corner flags that is broken.  The box is also in good shape.The teams included are Germany and the United States.  The teams have the "rounded dome" base.

Own Super Footy - fun fun fun!!  

I watched a professional play once.  He put a book in front of his players to the side of the goal.  He flicked his player into the ball, it went over the book and into the goal (even with an opponent playing goal)... amazing.  And the professional said he couldn't keep up with the current world's best... yikes.

I absolutely loved Subbuteo, though my mum hated it - at 99p each (I'm so old) she thought the teams were too expensive. Diving goalies? 75p. A pair of throw-in takers? 50p. So costly! "World Cup goals? What do you want those for? You've got goals, haven't you?" She also hated the fragility.

My "Continental Club Edition" (the Generic Blues vs. the Nondescript Reds) was so old it had wire handles for the goalies, and I'm convinced my dad found it in the back of a storeroom somewhere gathering dust. I only got the more comfortable green plastic ones when I bought extra teams, or the amazing INTERCHANGEABLE GOALKEEPERS! Not as exciting as it sounds. 

Ah, great days... the modern stuff looks really crap.

This game does an amazing job of simulating soccer/football... which to me is its exact problem. When you can play for 1-2 hours, without anybody actually scoring, there's something fundamentally wrong with the sport. Which is a shame because the mechanics and components are beautiful.

As close to real soccer in miniature as could possibly be achieved. A sublime and intense game, like table hockey in its speed and back and forth action. The game needs a nice astropitch table with side walls and players that have had their bases polished. The American way of being polite and waiting for your opponent to make a defensive move kills the speed and realism of the game.

This was by far my favourite game when I was a kid. As it's been over 20 years since I played this, and as I am now slowly getting back into board games after all that time, I wonder how I would feel about the game now. I would love to get my hands on a decent inexpensive copy, just to see how I feel about the game.
I played this for hours on end, usually with my brother. We created a massive international tournament that lasted for months. I think we annoyed our parents by having the game permanently set up on a craft table for months on end. Loved this game. This rating is based on nostalgia.

Basically, you flick players who then hit the ball and you try to score. You can only shoot after you are in the last 1/4 of the board. 1 piece can touch the ball 3 times in a row, then another piece has to touch it.

I've bought it again some years ago for my little nephew (he loves it but my old copy was close to disintegration, so it had to be done).

Surely fun if played well, but the heat often takes over the rules...

Football's a great theme for a dexterity game and it certainly helps bring this game to life. With just a basic set bought in a garage sale though, and at our beginner level, the results are often times pretty random with your flicks, which makes for some entertainment but it's not a game I want to really progress with to improve skill level. Subbuteo is lots of little flicks, here and there, edging into position. Sure, it's real time, but it still doesn't quite capture the flow of football to my mind. I prefer the straight up power, dynamism and team dynamic that fusbal tables provide in terms of football dexterity games.

I'm not the biggest fan of dexterity games, but this one is okay if you like soccer, and I'm fond of it as I used to play it when I was a teenager, but only occasionally since then.
Can be played simultaneously or on a turn by turn basis, which is pretty different.
I played thousands of times with similar homemade games (players out of bottle tops, goals out of shoes box lids and chickpeas for balls) in my childhood. 2 players but also 1 player games.

Gone a bit Subbuteo mad at the moment. Just a pity I can't play it regularly. Plays so well, especially if you avoid the "gamey" set up of creating a wall of defenders and just leave it as open play. Fierce, competitive and the satisfaction of scoring is brilliant. Loving it.

Now own metal goals and a Pegasus astropitch...just waiting for my son to be able to play properly in several years time. In the meantime, I'll buy a back brace because of all the bending and will keep flicking.

I recently bought this game for my youngest son. He is a soccer addict. I remember wanting this game when I was young, but I could never persuade my parents. Nowadays I could not find the original box, but an Internet shop sold me Zeügo instead. This is the same game, from the same factory. We played a whole sunday with the four of us (my wife, both my sons and myself) and had a lot of fun. 

It requires some skilled fingers (but we were all equally skilled), to get the players and the ball to do as you intended it. Besides that is also a beautiful game to watch. (Kees)

Quando era mais pequeno era a minha companhia diaria, fazia torneios sozinho e sei la o que mais... Hoje creio que ja nao me via a passar uma tarde a jogar subbuteo, mas, seja como for, nao deixo de lhe reconhecer valor, especialente enquanto jogo de futebol, creio que foi e sera o rei dos jogos de mesa dedicados a esta modalidade.

A Subbuteo Stadium!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
While I haven't played this in forever, I have very fond memories of the old Subbuteo league we had when I was much younger.

While it can be tricky for people to play, there is a suprising amount of strategy in this game. And it really is a game of practise makes perfect. The different surfaces involved for playing (I used to have the pitch on an upside down carpet at home - much different than the wooden board my mate had us play on) means that home team advantage can really make a serious difference! :)

Flimsiness of the players was always an issue for me, didn't take much for a player to get broken and they were a nightmare to try and fix.

Nostalgia is making me want to play again.....

I've spent a fortune these past 10+ years re-collecting teams I had when I was a young lad (originals were rather stupidly sold - but I wasn't to know then it would become so collectable!).

The first team I bought (in 1969) was Ref. 25 Celtic & it was in the original heavyweight style. I bought it from a friend & paid him 5/- (5 shillings) for it.

The first brand new classic heavyweight team I bought was Man Utd (from a Sports & Gun shop in Leighton Buzzard named Tom Lindars) & that cost me 9/11 (9 shillings & 11 pence)

Many enjoyable hours playing this game with my best mate Martin Weymouth - even though he ALWAYS beat me!

I also had a thriving league & cup solo set-up going for a number of years. All scores & scorers were methodically recorded - How sad.

THE CLASSIC, BEST FOOTBALL (or soccer) BOARD-flick-dexterity GAME EVER!! I designed and built an extra-heavy wood table for playing this game, and I´m very proud of it. Family and friends who come to my house usually asking me to play Subbuteo. It´s spectacular!

This is one of the most underrated games in the US!  There was a soccer (football) store near my school where one of my friends worked (early 80's).  We made the investment, and started playing.  We set up leagues at school, and eventually had about ten of us (including teachers) that would play at lunch.  My friends and I still have arguments as to who made the last second shot to win the game.  The only problem we had with the game was that none of us had the official rules.  We think we played close to the rules, but were never exactly sure.  Any way we had a great time.  As for teams,  I nver bought a starter set, and bought all the parts to field a complete game. nets, "astropitch", balls and teams.  Probably the funniest part, was that the two teams I have were the German National Team, and the Tampa Bay Rowdies from the North American Soccer League.  (My German team consisted of one "star" player,  Hans "stubby" Kraus,  A player that broke,  and when I glued him back together had only half of his legs) I still have the set, and look forward to when my 3 year old will be able to play.

There was one of the gang, who had Scalextric and because of that he thought he was better than you. 
Every day after school,
You'd go around there to play it,
Hoping to compete for some kind of championship,
But it always took about 15 billion hours to set the track up.
And even when you did, the thing never seemed to work.
 
It was a dodgy transformer, again and again.
 
A dodgy transformer, again and again.
 
It was a dodgy transformer, again and again 
A dodgy transformer that cost 3 pounds 10.
 

So he sent his doting mother
Up the stairs with the stepladder,
To get the Subutteo out of the loft.
It had all the accessories required for that big-match atmosphere.
The crowd and the dugout, and the floodlights, too.
And you'd always get palmed off
With a headless center-forward,
And a goal-keeper with no arms,
And a face like his.
And he'd managed to get hold of
A Dukla-Prague Away Kit,
His uncle owned a sports shop and he'd kept it to one side.
 
And after only five minutes
You'd be down to ten men,
And then he said sent off your right back for taking the base from under his left-winger.
Come to half-time, you were losing four-nil.
Each and every goal, a hotly disputed penalty
So you smash up the floodlights
And the game was abandoned,
And the dog would bark
And you'd be banned from his house.
And your travelling army
Of synthetic supporters
Would be taken away from you
And thrown in the bin.
 
And now he's working
In a job with a future.
He hands me my Giro every two weeks.
And me I'm on the lookout
For a proper transformer.
Uh.

(Half Man Half Biscuit, "Dukla Prague Away Kit")

RATING: 9
Subbuteo is an excellent flicking dexterity game. With experience, skill, and fast-play, it simulates soccer well. It's tactically interesting, physically challenging, and just plain fun. Quality components can get a bit pricey (I splurged, without remorse, on a set of Stefan Corda Scottish Vintage figures of Glasgow Celtic 1926 and Glasgow Rangers 1930 plus a good Astroturf pitch) but, like a good Crokinole board, are worth the investment.

After 36 years of wanting to try this game, seeing ads in Boys Life in the early 80s, I finally had the opportunity to try it. It blew away my expectations in every way. Immediately acquired a copy, an astropitch and fences.

Looking for additional teams in trade.

Fabulous game that recreates the strategy and flow of the game of soccer. Very difficult to master but very fun when played quickly with another seasoned player. 
While much of the extra equipment is just for show, the "corner kickers" and "throw-in" guys give plenty of extra play.

Just one partial play, but I can tell I'm really going to like this! It's got flicking, which is (of course) a good thing. But the fact that it plays in real time, with simultaneous play (pretty much) makes it especially attractive.

The one down side is that if you're not familiar with soccer, there seem to be an awful lot of rules to learn! Worse, you have to learn them enough to apply them in real time. Still, the game seems like it will worth the effort!

I got the 1986 World Cup version of this (Argentina vs. West Germany) and thought it was pretty cool at the time. How successful you were at the game itself depended solely on how good you were at flicking little plastic men around with your index finger (I never really perfected the required technique). It was fun for football obsessed kids like me and the challenge was to collect as many different teams as possible to play with (why we did this I don't know as it changed how the game played in no way at all. I guess it just contributed, along with Star Wars, Transformers and Japanese animation, to breeding a generation of young men obsessed with collecting over-priced pieces of plastic tat that their girlfriends and wives will never understand the importance of and that they one day hope to bestow upon their ungrateful grandchildren, who will in turn sell them for a fraction of what they were originally purchased for in order to buy drugs). Hurray for Subbuteo.

I'm not sure that 3-a-side was the ideal way to play this. It resulted in a lot of downtime and being 'in goal' was about as much fun as it was a kid on the concrete playgrounds.

As a game, it's odd; simulating football, but all being about positional blocking. It works, but it's just not football, Brian.

Many an hour wasted as me and my brother replayed the 78 World Cup matches or fanciful FA Cup meetings.

Which helped offset the inevitable attrition to my dad's feet...

Probably doesn't belong in the db with the rules as written (cf. billiards, darts, foosball, etc.) but who cares?  This is so intuitive and such a fun treatment of the beautiful game...but it's a serious PITA to get it playable. Wrinkled pitches make for a bad game, but it's bloody hard to get them just so without spending the extra dough and mounting a "real" pitch (Woodentop, Astrobase, etc.). I have an Astropitch that I finally mounted, and...wow, totally different experience. Looking forward to lots of plays with my daughters, new kits, the whole shebang.  Tremendous fun.

This rating is NOT based on the boxed Subbuteo set, but rather the highest quality table soccer equipment available.  The "professional" playing pitches (Astropitch and Woodentop pitches) and PTS "Sure Shot" bases make the game substantially better than any boxed set.  Granted, a "professional" set may cost about $200 including metal goals, but it is worth it.  Also, a good polish for the bases is also a must.  Also, FISTF rules are very complex, but very good.  They are available online.

I love football (soccer) and a good table soccer game. But whenever I play, I prefer Tipp-Kick over Subbuteo. Shots are the most exciting thing about football, and comparing long-range blasters in Tipp-Kick to rolling balls in Subbuteo makes for an easy choice for me.

Goodbye Space Hulk!  Traded for Cave Evil and Earth Reborn.

UPDATE--this is the 1st edition version for trade. It is a great game, but the type of game it is means I never, ever get to play it. And why have it just sit on my shelf looking impressive if someone else might get some play out of it?

Have just played the single player computer version, but this game looks amazing.  I upped it to a Must Have on my wishlist.

Won on eBay for ~$40 something.  Can't wait for it to arrive!  [update]  See LOTS of potential here--have only played the first mission with my brother, but would really like to get more into it.  The timer and the mechanics work so well!

RATING: 8
An asymmetric tactical combat game fought between the few (but powerful) space marines and the innumerable horde of genestealers within a space hulk (a giant, ancient space vessel, made up of old space ships, asteroids, and space debris). It's a game with all the fluff, theme, and background of Warhammer 40k, but without the "collectible" aspect and with a good and simple set of rules! The minis and board pieces look absolutely great, and there's about as much flavor and theme as you could hope for in a game. The rules are easy to learn and teach, fast and furious, and intuitive. It's awesome!

One of my early aquisitions. A good intro to younger or non-wargamers to get them to like both boardgames and tabletop miniatures. Theme complements the game mood nicely. Combat mechanics are too simplistic and luck dependent for me to score higher.

A fast and tense game, with tons of scenarios and arguably infinite replayability. Jamming a bolter or fumbling a hand to hand combat usually spells disaster for the marines, but as a game tipically lasts well under one hour you can always have a rematch (or switch parts).

I really enjoy a good game of Space Hulk, especially due to the fast paced strategy elements and the straightforward rules.  If you're playing as the marines it is always a very tense game, especially when using the timer as you have to think fast and not make mistakes.  Playing as the genestealers allows you to be sneaky and insidious, massing your troops for an all out attack or making swift unexpected attacks to catch your opponent off guard.

Rules for the Genstealer AI:
- Blips get randomly chosen entry points. They never lurk, unless forced by Terminators.
- Blips are revealed only when in sight. All genstealers can be placed, even if a long chain is formed. Once revealed, genstealers may continue performing actions! A Blip will not perform its last action if that implies to be revealed.
- Blips and Genstealers will run towards the nearest Terminator.

This (the 1st edition) is the game for Real Men! And for Real Creatures from Outer Space! I think this is the most exciting boardgame ever. It's all about atmosphere, the experience, and not about "winning" or "losing". Yes, it is quite random, but that only helps maintain the chaos and uncertainty for the marine player, who should be playing against the _mission_, not the other player.

2. A great game.

Outstanding game.

The simplicity of the mechanics combined with the sci-fi 'race against time' theme, excellent artwork and top production values of the components make this game one of my all time favourites.

Playing with a timer is a must to fully immerse yourself in the 'against the odds' experience as your marines fight the alien menace.

For me this game is a work of genius.

Don't get turned away by the strange style of graphics and story background here. What you get is a fantastic tactical battle simmulation in an "Aliens 2" like gameworld.

I discovered the existence of this game by playing it on the PC a few years back (and finished all the campaigns). The first and still only game that I play from GWS WH40k's line. But what a game!

OUTSTANDING tactical combat against alien monsters in cramped corridors with time-limited turns for the Space Marine player. Rules appear daunting but are actually quite simple. I don't know of any other game with similar angst. It gets a lot of requests! 

The time consuming setup is a drawback.

I have Space Hulk 2nd & 1st editions w/ the DeathWing expansion. Only by applying sound tactics will the Marine Player beat the odds.

As a Teenager, I liked the game, would then have scored it a 7, It was a nice dungeon crawl and the swapping of guns, probably triggered me to desire the Kingdom Death Miniature mods, swapping weapons & armour. Yet as an Adult, I doubt I'd return to it, Dungeon Crawls have come a long way, and I've restricted myself to Fantasy only. So while the game is ok (6-7), I won't likely play again(2-3).

This game is great.  A simple turn based game.  You really need to get the expension set genestealers to make more for the genestealer player.  It adds new depth that also for hybrids.

The only really exciting game that Games Workshop ever came up with. Rules (only the first edition, mind you) are very well written and make this game hectic but also tactical. The feeling of being alone out there with just a few guys in an immense spaceship full of creeps comes out well in the gameplay. Space Hulk always ends with one little space marine still alive, and one dice roll he has to make or fail. Not many games have this much tension.

Almost the perfect game, but I would rather play Blood Bowl.  So intense, so nerve wracking, so fun, so thematic.  Neat bits, TONS of genestealers, and the classic "Torch the Toilet" scenario.  It was better with painted Terminators, but then they were stolen, so now we are back to the plastic ones unless Mykenloft busts his out from storage.  Really good game.

One of GW's better offerings.  Didn't need TONS of miniatures to play although the box set was a bit pricey.  Pretty tense game, lot of sweaty palms as the nasty aliens race down the hall at your marines and the flamer runs out of fuel.  Almost impossible to win as the Marines, but it was a good time trying.  Cool 'blip' counters represent 1 to 3 aliens out of line of sight but picked up on motion trackers.  As with every GW game, TONS of dice rolling.  Used to own, sold it off in parts and made a bundle off of 40k freaks.  Kind of wish I had kept it, oh well.

Wow! An intense boardgame pitting man against monster reminiscent of the movie ALIENS. Something undeniably British about the "Forlorn Hope" aspect of the game-- the Marines face a monumental task in attacking the aliens, but going down with blasters blazing and a mounting alien body count is what it's all about. Lavish production quality by Games Workshop really draws players into the game. A bit complex, so it is not really for casual players. Miniature wargamers should have a GREAT time with this, however.

Lightweight miniatures game, which runs as aliens in the wh40k universe. The basic game we played is pretty simple and fast and furious. Definite tension as hordes of gensetealers bear down on your lone marine - will he manage to actually kill them or will his gun jam at the vital moment?

Due to Games Workshop's recent decision to force BGG to remove most files supporting this and other GW games, I have removed my "7" ranking from this game. I no longer wish to contribute to the game's ranking here on BGG.

First edition is absolutely punishing. From here forward, I think I'll be playing this with the 3rd edition rule about jams - if you jam while on Overwatch and spend 1AP to unjam, Overwatch resumes.

What a fantastically atmospheric game!  "They're coming out of the walls!"; "Apone?! Speak to me, Apone!"; "Game over, man, game over!" -- Huh? Whaddya mean, it's not about the Aliens movie? "Stay away from me, Bishop!"

Tremendous fun -- but the Space Marines don't stand a chance.  I barely scraped a draw -- and was hugely satisfied with that.  Those Genestealers just keep on coming...

Right: someone re-release this gem, or else!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
A fantastic board game based in the Warhammer 40K universe clearly inspired by the movie "Aliens". One player plays the Space Marine Terminators trying to clear derelict space ships of Genestealer infestations, played by the other player.

The system is tight and tense and provides a substantially different play experience for the two sides. Genestealers are numerous and their exact numbers are unknown until they can be seen. They lack ranged attacks but are incredibly deadly up close.

The Space Marines are fearless warriors, trained from birth and few in number. Armed with powerful Storm Bolters they can cut through swathes of aliens in open spaces, but the tight confines of a hulk provide a real challenge. If the stealers can get up close, the Marines are often done for.

If you have access to 3rd ed then just buy that instead.

A streamlined dungeon crawl boardgame, with relatively straightforward rules and a reasonable playing time.  It seems like it's showing its age a bit, although in some ways I like it more than Descent/Doom, which is arguably the next evolution of this design.  Descent/Doom have more decisions that must be addressed, but they also seem lik they bog down quite a bit more and can run much longer.  Space Hulk is a fun chapter in the history of the GW line.

This is in response to GW's request to have most of their player aids and rules references pulled from BGG. While I understand that it is within their rights to do so, I also believe that their is such a thing as being NICE. That is, as long as someone isn't hurting you, you should be good to them, even if it is with in your rights to be a grade A jerk. I find people that are jerks in these situations to be extremely, extremely annoying. So annoying, in fact, that the annoyingness transcends all rules, game types, and genres. Needless to say, Space Hulk falls within this category and therefore gets a "2" rating, as it is 'extremely annoying". On the bright side, it is still not as bad as You Can't Check Me, not that I would ever buy either one or ever suggest to anyone one else ever to do the same.

RATING: 7.5
This is a great old-style American game. The components are fabulous. If you know someone (or ARE someone) who knows how to paint miniatures, these can really start looking sharp.

The movement and combat is simple enough that you can teach and play in a short period of time, yet provide enough flexibility that there is room for creativity with tactics. 

Yes, luck is huge. But the best thing about Space Hulks is that there is lots of tension and excitement. Is the game well-balanced? Who the hell knows. But there are lots of scenarios, and you can just swap sides if the scenario seems too tough for the marines. This is one that I'd probably pick up if it were reprinted, but can't fathom paying through the nose for a hard-to-come-by OOP copy. I also don't need a lot of games like this in my collection, but I was pleasantly suprised by this one. After playing lots of Euros, its nice to change the pace and pull out something like this. There are a lot of reprinted or rehashed old American games coming out lately, much of which is not that great. Here's an old one that is worth your while.

The best game GW ever made.  Fantastic scenario based, squad combat game.  Brilliant time constrained play for the harried marines.  Try playing while listening to the soundtrack from Aliens.  Of course... basically broken.  Here is what the stealers do to win every game; every blip with 3 on it rush at the marines.  Every blip with 1 on it move away from the marines.  Pretty quick, you'll swamp the board with aliens.  Oh well - just don't play that way and you are in for a great game.

April 21, 2009 -- I'd heard for years about how much fun Space Hulk was, and I finally got a chance to check it out for myself last night. My opponent and I played twice, using the first mission and swapping sides. In both cases, the Genestealers annihilated the marines.

I greatly enjoyed myself and now really hope the rumours are true about a reprint coming. If so, I'll definitely pick up a copy of the game.

Sure, it's a light, beer-and-pretzels type of game, but the gameplay is smooth and quick, but you still have to make some tough choices. The blips for the Stealers and the timer for the marines add a level of tension often not found in games, and that's part of the fun. Not knowing exactly how much Genestealers are coming at you or not knowing how many command points the marine player has left really keeps a level of the unknown there, which adds to the mystery and paranoia.

Although possibly weighted towards the Stealers, the game is fast and fun. As I discovered, a game can be over in as little as ten minutes if things go really well or really poorly for either side.

Space Hulk is good fun, and I really hope it gets reprinted. 8/10

First and second edition. Fun, fast, deadly (especially when you accidentally up the number of blip counters every turn). The one major flaw: the Jammed result. Doesn't really fit thematically. I'd prefer to have 3x as many genestealers, and marines that can fight them.

I really like this game.  The time constraint on the Space Marines is a great mechanism that adds the critical sense of urgency.  I'm partial to squad level minis type games like this where movement is on a hex or grid based board rather than based on tape measure like Warhammer, etc.  The only reason I don't give this a higher rating is because it is pretty long and I so I can't play it as often as I would like.

Time has been kind to this old standby. One player has a few high-quality units (armored marines with guns), the other gets innumerable fast aliens with claws.

Yes, it's a hate rating and, no, I don't care.
Games Workshop can bite me.  Seriously.  GW's policies toward fan created content are totally ridiculous and completely inexcusable.  Board games are about imagination first and foremost - any game company that intentionally extinguishes the flame of creativity (the sister of imagination), at best, can be laughed at...  but a laugh is far more than they will ever get from me.    :shake:

Space Hulk is by the same game company as Warhammer 40, 000 (which I played once), but the game is WAY shorter. I have enjoyed my experience playing Space Hulk. It's quite enjoyable for what it is. 

Space Hulk is OOP today. I found that Doom: The Boardgame which is new from Fantasy Flight games, had a similiar gameplay as Space Hulk.

Some interesting ideas. Theme is good. Cool mechanics. Beautiful pieces. Lots of scenarios to choose from. Enjoyable, some luck involved.

A tactical delight! Each game is a tension filled pressure cooker as the Marine player battles against hoardes of Genestealers swarming over his outnumbered Space Marines.

RATING: 9
First edition. Don't bother with second edition rules they simply take away so much from the game. Check the net, somewhere out there you can download PDFs of the original rules. The only thing from 2nd Ed I like are the new HeavyFlamer rules. They offer more tactical choice. I'm no puritan or new-is-bad guy. It's just that the 2nd Ed rules are too simple, too shallow and too minimalistic for such a detail-focused game-concept. Nevertheless, 2nd Ed playing pieces (esp the tiles) are the way to go. They just look that much better and they go well together with the old ones if you are in need of a three square wide corridor...
That game oozes theme, as the saying goes.
BLIP around the corner, ready...uuaaargh. *Stealer attacking from an air vent...*

Okay, there is luck involved, as in all GW games, but this game is just plain COOL.  I'm such a fan, I bought it twice (1st and 2nd editions) and although it's hard to find people to play with me, at least I can always play with myself (by painting the figures).

When I reread the rules to both editions, I decided the 2nd edition is superior. Also, having played a lot more, I have to say that this game is simply FUN. I'm standing by the 10.

Games Workshop's finest boardgaming hour.  Heavily armed and armoured space marines skirmish with deadly aliens within the confines of a derelict spaceship...the theme is clearly ripped off from Aliens, but that's no bad thing.

If the idea of playing a board game that simulates the movie Aliens nearly perfectly excites you then step right on up to this masterpiece of a game. Use the timer and feel the suspense of a swarm of sensor blips coming ever closer to your marines locations and then ... becoming bloodthirsty swift aliens bearing down on your marines. Can you intelligently command your marines long enough to complete their mission and survive? :)

My favorite GW game ever. We all played Space Hulk for almost an entire summer exclusively. I would love to see it revamped and released again. Nice minis and components plus bloody combat. What more do you need?

RATING: 8
One of those rare games that I'm still willing to play even after all these years. And I have never once had a boring game with it... I'm thinking this should maybe have a 9 or even a 10 but I'm quite restrictive with those scores.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
I've only played 1st edition; like many GW games, Space Hulk has interesting theme, cool art and high production values, an outcome based largely on a small number of key die rolls, and far too little attention to game balance or clear, easy-to-understand rules. The latter two categories are far more important to me than the former two.

Great intro to miniatures and the world of 40k. Borrowing a lot from the movie 'Aliens' this really hit the spot in the 90's. Not balanced at all but it's not supposed to. Some missions are nearly impossible, others almost automatic wins for the space marines.

RATING: 8
Rating is for the 1st Edition. There is a lot to like here -- good components, plenty of flavor, and a just about perfect mix of game complexity to action. The blips and the bonus command points mechanics add just enough uncertainly to prevent this one from locking up with analysis paralysis (and the timer rule provides an additional nudge, although we rip through our turns long before the timer expires). Wonderful pace to this game, too, with the tension rising with cat-and-mouse gameplay, then exploding into furious action as the Genestealers charge and the Marines pray they don't roll doubles on overwatch. With all the dice flying around there are bound to be some luck swings, and some situations appear initially hopeless for the Marines ... but the game plays fast enough that match play is a realistic possibility for most scenarios. If the game had multi-player out-of-the-box and a little more depth in terms of choosing weapon types for the Marines I would rate it a "9," which is about as high as I ever go with a game rating (and I gather some of these things are introduced by the expansions, which I shall now redouble in my efforts to find). Great game, and it works just as well with my eight-year-old as with my adult opponents.

Games Workshop post circa 1985 inherently annoy and depress me, rather than fill me with rosy nostalgia, as it does for many UK gamers.

However, this one is actually a good game. Oddly, it's a time pressure affair that I don't find stressful, for some reason, with a decent balance 'tween theme and mechanics.

Pure 2 player strategy and fun. Relive Aliens the movie.  Cool figures. Clever scenarios. Some clever rules ideas (gun jamming).  But a teensy bit heavy on the luck factor. Gotta love those excellent little white GW d6s though.

RATING: 7
Rating for 1st edition with Deathwing expansion. Incredibly tense, exciting and hard! Maybe too hard, insanely difficult to win as Space Marines. With the Deathwing expansion (must have) you get the assult cannon and lightning claws for the Marines. Borrows the best bits from Aliens and puts it in the 40K universe, with great results. Always play with a timer, just like in the first edition. Otherwise, all drama is gone. You can skip the Genestealer expansion.

If I had to put a note in my gaming history.  This would probably have to be the first game in 'modern board gaming'.  As a miniature gaming group this was an easy sell and it was fairly quick for us to start playing this instead of a full blown miniature game.  (Although, there then came a great lull in my board gaming when we went back to almost full time play of mini games).

Approx. 20 pre-logging plays.

Great game if you're at all interested in 40K. I have no idea why Games Workshop has parceled off all their crappy board games to Fantasy Flight but apparently retains the license to this one. They should have retained Talisman and let FF release this....
And then GW released 3rd Edition, which is mostly better than 2nd Edition. Well played GW, well played.

Rules are dead simple, but the game is full of atmosphere, the bits are wonderful.  Nice.
Once you have played a mission once or twice on each side, however, there is no variability, so SH is a nice system with wonderful bits, but not a 9 or 10 for me.

RATING: 8
Rating after the first 3 games - 8.  The rules are simple, but we made several mistakes during the first ten games.  It is very important to play by the rules, otherwise the balance is pushed to much in favor of marines/genestealers.  

December 2007 - painted miniatures look great and I cannot imagine myself playing with unpainted figures.  It is just a different experience when you see a furious stealer with blood-covered claws, red eyes and open mouth heading your way!  The marines get personality and it is much easier to distinguish them.

As for gameplay, it is fast, tense and rewards clever placement of your units.  We have only played the first 3 missions from the 1st editon, so I guess that with more weapons from the Deathwing expansion and additional scenarios, Space Hulk will be even better and more strategic. 

The game is deadly for Space Marines.  Still waiting for Deathwing expansion, which got lost on its way from UK.  I think they are vital to give Marines a chance agianst the Stealers.

RATING: 6
A fun little sci-fi shoot-em-up. Advance planning is essential for the Marines, get specialist guys out of place in those narrow corridors and you're in for a hard time. The Genestealers have no strategy as such, but ultimately both sides just have to pile in and roll the bones with the luck having a pretty coarse granularity. The tactics are pretty simple, but I've got into this in a minor way as a sort of simpler version of Tide of Iron. I won't buy into GW's business model with their refusal to allow a fan community to exist, so it's second hand for me, although even used sets are stupidly expensive.

Ideal Players: 2

Description: Play the Aliens or the Space Marines in tense combat.

Pro: Scenarios provide replayability. Time pressure makes the game especially tense for the marines. Hidden information makes the game tense for the aliens. Mechanics match theme perfectly.

Con: Not much more than combat. Only supports two players. Ultimately comes down to random die rolling.

Very cool game. First game I played with a gameboard that's different each time. Tiles, what a concept. Sure it's a ripoff of the Aliens movie, but who cares. It had great atmosphere right down to replicating the beeping dots that are coming at you and not knowing if it was one or six Genestealers you'd be hooking up with. As for the bits, well it's Games Workshop so they are top notch. The only drawback to this game? The price. But I guess it's cheap compared to what some are paying for on E-Bay now.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Played to death. Several sets of the base game, plus several sets of the expansions resulted in mega epic trawls through the bowels of ships. Much loved, but in the end played so much that it became dry - the tactics and positioning too well practiced.
Created a cooperative system for this game, where the stealers would run themselves via a set of cards. The system was brutal and won most its games - its solid tactics backed up by a tiny amount of unpredictability which would inevitably challenge a marine player when he thought he was safe . . .

RATING: 9
Worthy of all the praise that's been heaped on it over the years.  Not hard to learn and a nail biter to play.  Part of what makes the 1st edition better is the time limit for the Marine players - it helps keep the game moving. (the alien player will want to play faster as well to avoid giving the marines too much opportunity to plan on his turn)  Set up time can run a little long, but this can be solved by changing sides or allowing the marines another crack at the same scenario.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
So far this is the miniature game I enjoyed the most, i.e. I rate it 6/10 and wouldn't mind playing it again occasionally. It's better than Doom or Blood Bowl (my only comparisons in this area) as it plays faster and feels a bit more like a tactical puzzle than a dice fest. With overwatch and command points it offers enough options to make it a challenge for the marine player and the short scenarios give the opportunity to change roles in a rematch. Still, I don't see myself shelling out 79 EUR for the new third edition. I could have more fun with it if it contained counters instead of miniatures and only costed 39 EUR.

My all time favorite game. I remember the first game I played with my brother. The marines had to kill 30 genestealers and of course the genestealers had to wipe out the marines. It came down to the last marine and last genestealer. Marine on overwatch, genestealer coming down the hall, miss, miss, miss, OH! NO! hand to hand against a genestealer and his marine managed to pull it off. Talk about tense. YUP! Good game.

[NOTE: 2ND EDITION GAME] 
This is probably the most simple of the tactical squad based games (including Doom and Space Crusade). Its certainly enjoyable and fun, with an exceedingly high kill rate, but the actions for both Marines and Genestealers are pretty limited. The rich history of the Warhammer universe really shines here as there are some really interesting missions provided.

You can read it on the box: "Man versus alien in desperate battle". And it is desperate, at least if you are the human player. If you like a balanced game this is not your cup of tea. Fair? Not at all!

Is it a bad game then? Absolutly not, there is no game I rather play. And the desperation is a vital part of the unique atmosphere of Space Hulk.

The Space Hulk MicroBadge was the first thing I ever spent GG on.

Not a huge fan as others probably are. I had this version when it came out, and while I tried to like it, I rarely saw the Space Marines win, and the Terminator models were horrendous. I wouldnt want to play it today.

Great tactical game with a wonderful atmosphere. There is a lot of pressure when playing the marines side using the timer cause you don't know how many aliens are rushing towards you.

I'm getting totally hooked and into the game. I've build my own terminator squads with magnets in the arms and torsos to switch weapons.

RATING: 9
This game fits the bill for me in so many ways, and misses in a few ways. The system is extremely streamlined and full of tough decisions. This is what a game with dice rolling should be about, killing, and worrying that your gun with jam when you need it the most.  
At the same time the game is a little simplistic in it's elements. I am sure the expansions would add a lot to the game, but with the prices as they are on them I don't know if I will ever get that chance.
The Blip and Overwatch elements to this game are ingenious, and should be something other designers aspire to creating in their games.  
Hopefully I will be able to find something between this and Doom which would be kind of the opposite end of the  spectrum for me in squad based small skirmish games. Doom has too much going on, this didn't have enough. 
All in all this is a great game that has really held up over the years. My rating may even go up to a 9 on this one with some more plays, but it could never go higher than that because it just doesn't scratch the itch to have more unique play out of the pieces.

This is the new version.  Best for teenage boys, there is a certain tension between the overwhelming advantage of each team in its own element: the terminator heroes have guns good to stop anything at a distance.  The evil genestealers can often wipe out half a squad if they can just jam one gun at the right moment.  This game often ends with the heroes dying when they can't set up a field of fire to block a corner effectively.  The components are top rate and we often use them to set up spaceship combat with other games.

This was a HUGE hit when I got it back in high school and far surpassed any other game I had played to that point in terms of the game mechanics, theme and sheer tension. I couldn't get enough and when the PC game came out, I went nuts for that too!

Preordered the 3rd edition August 2009. Fully planning to use my 2nd ed minis with this.

Feb/Mar 2016 - Constructed a mini version using scans of map tiles online and paper 2.5D minis for the aliens. Cute as anything, but the game play is dated.

Tactical skirmish with sci-fi theme.

It features some nice ideas and has very manageable rules.
Randomness plays a crucial role (strategy is not irrelevenat, but it is secondary to rolling well the dice).

The asymmetry of the game is cool, but the genestealer can play mindlessly and win, while the space marines can play brilliantly and still lose to thanks to a few bad rolls. Great tension though, and great fun (if slow) in the 2vs1 mode. Main problem for me: suspending disbelief. Giant guys in massive powered armor get shredded in seconds by skinny drooling crabs. God, the embarrassment! Would have been a totally immersive if the Terminators had been swapped for regular marines as in the movie Aliens; they WOULD have got eaten...

1st edition = simple but great. 2nd edition lost so many of the things that made it so (no command points in the genestealer phase! that's most of the tactics and any bluffing gone then!). Initially the scenarios seem stacked in the genestealers favour but the more you play the better your marine tactics become and soon you see that they're normally very finely balanced. 3rd and 4th edition nearly there, but too much chrome. Go back to the basics of 1st edition, the cleanest and still the best.

Lot to like here . . . stands the test of time and appears to have possibily inspired more current games likse Doom and Descent.  The blips really capture the essence of such sci-fi greats as Aliens.  But, is all the hoopla in order?  If you like the the WH 40k then probably yes.  If you like the games, themes mentioned above, then probably yes.  If not, or if you are just lukewarm on them, then probably not worth it . . .

RATING: 9
Ah, Space Hulk. You have a special place in my heart. 

Best played with the timer rules strictly enforced for maximum tension on the marine player. I've had a lot of fun playing this three player, with two marine players each commanding a squad, and forced to share the command points, which makes for some pretty good down-to-the-wire haggling. 

We've had great fun even just making up scenarios on the spot for this one, something I'm not really down with usually.

Heavilly armed and armoured space marines fight at close quarters deep within derelict spaceships against unlimited hordes of vicious aliens.

I love the fanatical medieval style. Games Workshop product, so it concentrates on miniatures.

RATING: 8
One of the few gems from GW. Customizable board, fun and strategic game play. Part of the problem is that some of the scenarios are not balanced and that playing the marines requires far greater skill than the aliens. Worse, is that in the basic set, there is little advice for setting up your own scenarios. Despite these shortcomings, a fun and tense game.

OMG I loved OG Space Hulk so so much. The timer mechanic is sheer freaking genius, the first real-time game I ever played I think. The expansions made it rich and amazing, and I painted the heck out of everything and even built 3d tiles. Nothing but good memories of this game. I played the 2010 edition and it wasn't really as fun, for reasons I can't put my finger on. Could be that it was fun for my early-20s self but not that fun for my early-40s self.

RATING: 7
It's naught but a big whack-fest, but that's fine in a 2 player (as opposed to multi=player). There's some nice tactical decisions to make, and then you get to live out the shootout dramas. Good for the ride.

RATING: 6
Used to own it, but no longer.  I kind of miss it, and my nostalgia is probably bumping the rating up.  Nonetheless, at the time the timed move element was unique.  I don't know that the Space Marines ever win, but it seemed the game play was always intense.  Until you got down to your last two or three guys and just got to sit around waiting for the reaper to arrive.

Pretty cool game, but I just prefer to play other things these days, as there are only 6 missions available, and all the others I've found on the internet require more tiles than I've got.  Some scenarios, if played viciously by the genestealers, are nearly impossible for the marines to pull off.

Exellent mechanics for the theme. Really makes you feel the pressure and urgency of your mission. And equally fun to feed the uncaring monsters to the bolter fire just to see the Marine player's pain when that critical bolter jams. I do feel that five marine scenarios are actually better than 10 marine scenarios because they are more easily handled and tend to move on bit faster.

But not my past. I completely missed out on Space Hulk. At that point I had dropped out of gaming for a few years, No intention of getting this on Ebay its way too expensive,I will either print my own boards or even better get my hands on the rumoured new edition,if it exists.Either way I will play the 1st edition rules which to mind perfectly capture the theme of this game.

If you were looking for a negative only Ines I can think of are the terminator miniatures were pretty poor and showed limit of plastic moulding at the time, but easily overcome by the metals you could buy. The genestealers were pretty cool (for their day)!

2nd edition game (the one with the custom dice and incompatible with the Deathwing and Genestealer expansions)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Possibly the best GW game ever. It combines so many good features with such simple yet effective implementations. The alien Genestealers are "blips" (representing 1-6 units) until they come into sight, limiting the Space Marine player's knowledge about the enemy he has to face. The Marine player's turn is timed, representing the rapid and relentless nature of the Genestealer attack. Guns can jam...

You can introduce a new player to this game in minutes, yet it has strong tactical depth and excellent replayability. I really need to find more time to play it.

To childish. I have outgrown it. I have the vague feeling that the battle is unbalanced between the marines and aliens - but i don't know how.

I really enjoy playing this tense game with gamer friends.

1st Edition.  This is one of my favorite games.  I'm a big fan of the Warhammer 40,000 universe and enjoy several of the games that use it as a background, but Space Hulk is the most accesible of them to new players.  Playing this game reminds me of the movie Aliens which is a real plus in my book.  I don't really like the terminator miniatures that come in this game and the art on the corridor tiles is a little plain and lackluster, but the game itself is a joy to play.  Seeing that I've owned this game for almost twenty years now and still enjoy playing it speaks volumes about how good I think this game is.

An old classic and still the best generic, modular board miniatures game out there. Rules are fast and simple and yet simulate the claustrophobic scenarios very well (Genestealer supplement screws up the simplicity and balance though). Creating scenarios is easy and replay value is very high. The theme is a reinterpretation of the Alien movies, and being a fan of the W40k universe will probably be a prerequisite for some players. Onward marines!

What Games Workshop did well in its older days was combine quite playable games with awesome back story.

When this first came out a friend of mine was pretty hyped about this game.  I simply had to play it according to him.  Well I played it, and it worked, I guess, but I didn't care if I won or lost.  He insisted that I play it again and that I'd love it on the second try.  

A week later, I played it again, and the game still succeeded in what it was trying to do.  After multiple plays I finally told the guy I wasn't really interested in giving it another chance.

But then again I don't like the movie Aliens, Meatheads vs Things with no personality, so there you go.

UPDATE: I've since played it again.  It's just kind of ok.  It is a strange timed puzzle, the logistics of moving your guys around makes the game much slower and clunkier than what I want out of an action game. To prevent the game from devolving into a mathy tedium the moves are timed.

I will never forget the tremendous fun we had when we played the game over and over again. Then came all the expansions which were fantastic and to the present day I still play, even if it´s third edition.
What excels this gem is that the rules are very easy to understand, but the game is hard to master. This is what all game designers with their rulebook bibles should remember!! It´s similar to chess: You can explain it to a six year old in 5 minutes, but it takes a lifetime to master. While Space Hulk is certainly more complex than chess, concerning its basic rules, it is flowing very naturally compared to most other games, but it is eons away from being a simple shooting game.The designers left away everything that´s too complicated and the structure of the game proves that less is truly more! 
All the other rip offs may have introduced something new here and there, but they ALL failed to bring us a game that is as BALANCED and FLOWING as this one! And as BEAUTIFUL!! You´ve got fantastic playability, strong atmosphere and aesthetics. What more could you expect?
If you can get it, then get it!! If not, then steal it!
Amen!

A tense little game with aliens running unseen around the corridors.
The marine player must play a game against time and numbers, moving his marines to cut off corridors and overwatch against the usually numberless genestealers. The 'stealer player must hide and watch, bringing overwhelming force to bear against one bit of the marine player's perimeter in hopes of a breach.
Hard to imagine a better game.

I was very much surprised by this game.  I had never played it before when it was originally out.  But a friend introduced me to it just before the release of the new one.  I'm very thankful that he did, because it allowed me to buy the 3rd Edition when it was still readily available.  

The more I've played it since then, the more I've liked it.

I own the re-released version.  Really captures the feel of Aliens.  You really feel like you are making a last ditch stand against overwhelming odds, and you dread that eventual bolter jam that will seal the fate of your terminator.  Scenarios are a bit unbalanced though, making it extremely difficult.

This is one of my favorite table top games.  The rules in general don't cover as many things as I would like in the basic set, but the expansions easily take care of that.  Is almost like a table top version of Aliens with teh way the system operates.  Biggest drawback is the 'coolect the units and paint them' aspect found in many Games Workshop games.  People who have no issues with that will probably enjoy this game.

Excellent self contained miniatures game. All the scenarios you need are in the box. There are expansions for this, & you can add them to it. Deathwing is easily added & is fun too, after that, the expansions start adding too much & the game bogs down.

One word: incredibly boring. Why?

No real decisions to be made from either side.

Extremely bare-bones gameplay, that's trapped in the 60s with no interesting mechanics.

Takes way too long for what it actually is(a simple dice game)

Almost no replay value, once you go through the campaign, that's it. You will mostly take the same approach each time for each scenario, only difference is in the dice rolls.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Fan-freakin' tabulous. This is gold baby, gold! Miniature's combat at it's brutal finest (1rst edition x2)

To elaborate, the decisions all matter in Space Hulk. Yes, dice are involved but a good player can mitigate their influence. The better player wins in Space Hulk. Simple rules and a fast pace (timer) keeps the intensity up. Uncertainty in the number of command points available keeps the 'stealer player guessing.

I fully admit to some rose colored glasses (it was my introduction to the Games Workshop world) with this one, but when I take the glasses off the game is still bright rosy red.

Ten per 'I always want to play and this will probably never change'.

For me, this has been the definite two-player game for a long time. No other game is as filled with suspense yet so easy to teach, and I noticed that players are unusually quiet when playing this game. This opinion is based on the first edition of the game, however, as I would gladly deduct one point for its successor (the version I happen to own). Problem of the second edition is that they streamlined the rules too much, and improved the odds for the marine player considerably, which made me feel that they were targeting a younger audience all of a sudden. That's why I play the 2nd edition with 1st edition rules.
UPDATE: It is uncanny how the game always ends with a very close victory for either side. The balance of the scenarios is just incredible. Similar newer titles that I played, like Hybrid and Claustrophobia, cannot even hold a candle to this beauty.

Space Hulk is probably one of the best games in my collection and certainly one of the hardest to replace if something were to happen to my copy.

The theme grabs you from the beginning. The rules are surprisingly straight-forward, quick and easy to teach, and filled to the brim with artwork and background history to excite you for the setting and to prepare you for the game, which plays as a series of small skirmishes in the twisting, labyrinthine bowels of a vast, derelict starship.  Each side has its own strong flavor, be it squads of armored space marines with lots of big guns or never ending swarms of vile alien monstrosities with claws and big, sharp, pointy teeth who scuttle ever closer and closer.

Ostensibly a two-player game, it's incredibly easy to accommodate more without really affecting the gameplay.  The simplest approach is to just pick a larger scenario with enough forces to divide amongst the players equally, and there you go.  The open ended aspect of the tiles used to build the "hulk" each mission also makes homemade missions specifically built for larger numbers an easy enough thing to plan, especially if you can acquire or make more tiles with which to build even bigger battlefields.

I've had this game for nearly twenty years, and it never gets old.  Of course, I have both of the expansions as well as the campaign mission book, so take that as you will.  With all that they add, there are so many different scenarios to try or new marines armed with varied new weaponry that I can use to add to the mayhem.  Even the bad guys get in on the expansion fun with ambush counters and half-human hybrids carrying ranged weapons of their own.

On top of all that, if you're so inclined, you can paint the miniatures up nicely and even acquire a few more from GW's mini lines to further enhance "the look".  With decently painted minis duking it out on Space Hulk's tiles, this can be an absolutely awesome looking game.

Few but strong versus many.  The later re-release was better if you didn't like the time constraint element and wanted combat dice specifically made for the game.  It's more fun for the Space Marine player in planning how to accomplish the mission where as for the Gene Stealers it's just how many you can throw at your opponent at once.I have both the 1st and 2nd edition thrown together in one box. I like the 2nd ed. better for nicer graphics but this one sports the original timer for the Marines along with tougher rules for overwatch and jam clearing.

[b]GREAT GUN-BATTLING, ALIEN-DESTROYING, SPACESHIP BOARDING, SCI-FI HORROR GAME![/b]

This well-crafted game simulates bloodthirsty battles between man and alien on hulking great spaceships/bases. It is a thinly veiled rip-off of ALIENS - this you know - and is one of my favourite games. I have had the 1st edition since this beauty came out, and I've played out all of my gun-toting "Ripley" fantasies through it ever since. There is a tactical gamic thrill to be had from trying to command the marines better than Gorman; saving the marines from a blood-splattered death by the biomechanical jaws of jet-black, slime covered alien predators. "Maybe if I place covering fire at a different intersection, or retreat down this tunnel, things will end differently," you breath to yourself, dice in hand. Faint hope...

I adore the movie, and Space Hulk is its living, breathing relative in cardboard form.
This game was a top-tier GW release, and has never been beaten in terms of gameplay and grim atmosphere. The hard-card room/tunnel/door sections are well made and durable, the rules solid and easily explainable to non-wargamers.

Ostensibly a 2-player game, we have slaughtered hordes of genestealers in multiplayer too. The system can handle multiple players with no problem at all; just give each player their own squad or group of marines. Sure, it's best with two, but a group can have a cool time here.

Seriously good gameplay and cast-iron rules make for tense battles in this corridor/room shooter - itself later copied, and overcomplicated, by the Doom boardgame. The time limit mechanism makes playing the marines a nail-biting experience. Plenty of frantic dice rolling, with a push-your-luck sustained-fire game mechanic, keep the players on their toes. Speedy decisions must be made by the marine player on each and every turn: do I run down the corridor, blasting; do I flame the room with one of my own men in; or do I turn and go into overwatch? All decisions are heart pounding when played against the clock, expertly simulating the short timespan the marines would have to think against a superior, lightning-quick alien threat.
Also, the blip mechanism (that hides the number of alien enemies) has never been bettered, and portrays the plinking motion trackers from the movie in a great gamey manner. Ten metres. Five metres. Three metres! They're in the room!

You will find yourself shouting out things during play like, "Get to medical!" and "Game over, man," and "How could they cut the power? They're animals!" and "Remember, short, controlled bursts." This all ups the fun factor, naturally, immersing everyone in the theme.

Playing as the aliens is just as fun; sending hordes of ferocious xenomorphs into battle is a thrill, and the strategies of lurking, building up your forces, or straight onslaughts, are fun to learn and craft.

Many, many wonderful hours have been lost to this game, some played solo!
We play with painted minis to give the game that authentic "Cameron" feel. I even have scale models of the APC and Dropship, which fit nicely onto some of the missions that we play - check out my pictures. And, if you're in the mood, replace the genestealer patriarch with a hand-built model of the Alien Queen.

BTW, the 2nd edition doors/tiles are miles more colourful than 1st ed, and the 2nd ed dice are sublime; so I recommend a mixup game of both editions. The newer dice have a different effect on how sustained fire operates, and I think, on balance, that I prefer 'em.

[b]CONVERSION PROJECT FINISHED:[/b]
I replaced all the plastic genestealers with painted/based ALIENS alien warrior miniatures (Horrorclix). They look as cool as cool things sat in a freezer drinking iced tea from frosted glasses!
Some Space Hulk geekpriests, hereabouts, view the Aliens redressing as the slaying of a sacred cow. I do NOT agree with those GW fanboys.

TIP: For maxinum immersion in the ALIENS experience, put on the movie CD in the background during play - this rocks!

I own ALL the expansions.

NB. I've upgraded my rethemed Space Hulk to a 10. I will NEVER get tired of blasting aliens apart with pulse rifles. Unless forced to do it for real on Acheron. "You can count me out, man!"

JULY 2014 UPDATE: A good friend insisted we dust off the old beast (not my missus - this game!), and put her through a mission or two. Actually, I wasn't most keen. Why? Can't rightly say. Maybe I'm too ordained now in the 'Cult of the New'. 
Anyhow, wow, we had an absolutely brilliant evening, rolling dice and shooting aliens (me), or ripping the faces off marines (him). It's easy to forget just how frackin' awesome [i]Space Hulk[/i] still is for her age. She's so lean. A bare bones design that works fantastically well, shitting all over pretenders to the throne (I'm looking at you [i]Omega Protocol[/i]). And the old girl's just so much fun.

[i]Space Hulk[/i], you still got it, girl.

I loved this game. My friend lost it and I am getting a copy for myself now. Rules were very easy to understand and over all a very fun game.

I finally got the game and still love it. I don't have the genestealers for it but I am substituting heroscape guys for genestealers. I introduced my brother to it and he loves it also.   

My brothers favorite game. Along with Descent I would have to say mine as well.

Inspired by the Aliens film, the modular game board, hidden blip movement, turn timer and jamming weapons provide nailbiting tension.  The first edition is best with its action points, copious expansions, background literature and artwork.  2E features improved Terminator models and more colourful floor plans but the rules are dumbed-down and have lost most of the appeal of the original.  Have now played 3E which is much like the first with some simplification.

Deathwing was a good expansion for it.  Genestealer wasn't as good.

I haven't played 1e, but as I consider this the same game as the 3rd edition (basic idea, just a few rules changes that although they do change the tactics, they don't utterly and totally change the game) and I rate 3e a 10, I rate this a 10 aswell.

Edit: had 2 games of 3rd edition FtF and the marines got slaughtered both time but enjoyably so. Still a great game.

Edit: played a couple of solo and f2f with my son. Great, great game.

Redundancy forced sale.

Only one playing, but feeled nice. I like the way blips are an unknown amount of genestealers until you see them. It feels kind of hopeless for the marines, but that's just lack of experience, I guess..

Played it and had loads of fun! Made my own scenarios but never got to play them because I sold the game to fund other ventures.

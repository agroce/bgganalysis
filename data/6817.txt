Eh, I loved the game, but I'm still burnt out from playing so much over the years.  I prefer Spades or Some R Set for trick taking.  But, I will gladly play this when offered up.

Update:  Been playing three handed as we wait for others to show on game night.  Good stuff with three who are vet players.  Still a 10.  I'm back into it.

I think the game is best with five and second best with three.  Not a big fan of the four player game.  Even better is having six or seven so every few hands you can get up, get a beer, hit the head, peek at how others are playing.  Good stuff!

(Own dedicated Bavarian suited Schafkopf deck with mildly over-sized cards)

Schafkopf is a traditional trick-taking game widely played in Bavaria and other regions of Germany. It probably should be distinguished from the various games that carry the Sheepshead name in the US as it is a 4 player only game in Germany, whereas in the US it has mutated into several odd player count games (3, 5). (And not incidentally, that game should really be separated from this entry as they are VERY different).

The original game is a fairly straight-forward trick taking game with a couple of twists. The deck is short, 32 cards, from A down to 7. The deck has a long trump suit of Obers, Unters, (both ranked in standard Acorns / Leaves / Hearts / Ornaments order) and the rest of the Hearts in standard A-10 rank order, and then the off-suits. Before play begins, players have to make a quick declaration which will set partnerships, or allow a person taking a solo to change the trumps up slightly (i.e.: Obers are no longer trumps, &c.), or, in a normal game, to just get a partner by calling for an Ace that they don't have in their hand. Once this happens, play begins.

Play is standard trick taking fare, except the trump suit is extremely long. Side suits are only good for one go around, and it's not uncommon for people to start out missing an entire side with only one card in another because there are so many trumps. The goal is to get half the card points in the game. The cards have the standard Euro point value of A/10 = 11/10, and K/O/U is 4/3/2. There are 120 points in the game, so taking more than 60 is the goal. If you really put the boots to the other team, then you can get a bonus point or two. In addition to this, when the second card is played, saucy players can make declarations that they are going to win to create a point multiplier. This can go up to a maximum of 5, and is really the only way to jack the score quickly in this game. The winning team's points come out of the losing's teams score, so the scores always add back up to zero. This is also why going solo is valuable, if you win a normal hand for 1 point as a solo, you get 1 point from each other player.

The game plays until people are done with it. We usually play games like this for 8-12 deals, though in Germany or amongst casual gamers it's usually played for money or drinks, hence it can be an all day affair if you like it enough.

Schafkopf is a serviceable and decent trick-taking game. It's very similar to Doppelkopf in some ways, as Doppelkopf is basically the "gamer's" version of this system (it has a double deck, many extra side rules, a more difficult way of forming partnerships, more pre-game declarations and more complex in-game bidding/declarations) but Schafkopf is much simpler. The short hands and tighter restraints on the players can be good in that it makes the game easier to teach (i.e.: unless your group is used to European conventions such as the order of ranks and the point value that cards are worth) and would likely make this a good candidate for casual play with people who ordinarily like stuff like Spades and Hearts. It's bad in that if you are already a Doko head it feels quite stripped back. I would probably define this to casual gamers as Bavarian Euchre. It's not as mindless as Euchre, but Schafkopf is to Doppelkopf as Euchre is to Spades, a step down in complexity, albeit still more complex than most card games that are played in the US. 

In an absolute sense this might be a generous 8, but I like having Schafkopf in my tool kit because it's something that I've successfully taught to American card gamers who normally only play stuff like Euchre and Reverse, and I think Schafkopf is much more interesting than either of those games. I still much prefer the more complex Doppelkopf, but Schafkopf is still a fine traditional trick taker with some fun nuances like variable partners that are unusual outside of Europe.

RATING: 7
The best trick tacking traditional card game.  Of course, you have to grow up in Bavaria or in eastern Wisconsin to have even a chance of learning to play this.  Best with 5, but playable from 3 to 7.  If you ever get the chance, learn this.

I believe that this is the equivalent to the card game Sheepshead. Sheepshead is a great 5-player trick-taking game where a gutsy card-player plays against the table... but the player holding a named ace is secretly in a traitor! This adds a great psychological/strategic element, as the four of you look at each other and try to guess via your cardplay 'which one of you is feeding him the good cards?'. The game has a large and VERY enthusiastic following all over the Milwaukee area... probably due to the huge German heritage there. No one here in Upstate NY has ever heard of it though... *sigh*, I miss home...

1st played 11/05/2007. I know this as Sheepshead. It takes <5min to to taught and about 30min to play. Played with standard deck of 32 cards (7-A). Diamonds are trumps and all Queens and Jacks are top cards. Queens over Jacks. Clubs, Spade, Hearts, and Diamonds. Ace, 10, King, 9, 8, 7. Everyone is dealt 7 cards. Cards are worth points, Q=3, J=2, A=11, 10=10, K=4 totalling 120 points. Each person decides wether or not to bid or pass. If you bid, then you must take 61 points or you lose. The bidder also gets the 4 burried cards and can chose from those. He then burries 4 cards which will count in his point total. Once bid is made, the bidder anounces the card that determines who his partner is. Jack of Diamonds is it if the bidder doesn't have it. Jack of Hearts, Spade and Clubs are used in that order if bidder has Jack of Diamonds. He doesn't know who his partner is however until that card is played. If the defense doesn't take a trick, they lose 3, 1-29 lose two, and 30-59 just one. 60  they get two points. If no one picks, then you play "least". No partners and everyone tries for least points, yet still taking at least one trick. All losers pay the winner a point. This has a good luck/strategy balance which I highly recommend.

Jan10:

Well, I've played this 20 times.  What do I think?  Meh.  But when it comes to 5 player trick taking, I don't have a ton of options.

In particular, it's almost like Euchre.  It's nearly possible to play your hand on autopilot.  The only thing stopping you is determining who the parter is.  But often times that lasts all of one trick.

There is an often interesting decision in when to pick the kitty, but that doesn't quite make it cool enough.

Really, if you're looking for Euchre for 5, this will do well enough.

AKA "Sheepshead" from which Skat and then Doppelkopf were derived from.  Excellent trick taking card game with lots of trump. Rating is for the American version or "Wisconsin" version where I believe it orginated in the US and where the person who taught me was from. 

Plays with 3 to 5 players with a normal 52 card deck (which is cut down to 32). A little tricky to learn and can be played at yahoo. In a 3 player game one person calls and plays against the other two. In a 5 player game you can go alone against the group or call a silent partner which initially only he will know who he is, then the caller and the group must determine through card play who it is. Apparently the original German 4 player version could be best, need to try that. Another very fun game.

Requires more creative play than Euchre, to which it is often compared. I love the rapid pace, the rules variants, the element of risk taking as the "picker," and of course the gambling.

RATING: 9
The best traditional cardgame ever.  The variant we play is close to traditional 4-handed Bavarian Schafkopf (researched it, there's a book about the game) and comes to us from Nebraska friends.  This variant they call 'Buck'.  Black queens partners, until only two players are left that haven't gone out, then they partner for the rest of the hand with one of the two people who are out.  Last one not out is the 'Buck'.  Points in 3 - 6 - 12 increments.  36 is out.

The suspense of finding your partner is a blast.  We play with 7 and up, 32 cards.  Trump is QC, QS, QH, QD, JC, JS, JH, JD, AD, 10D, KD, 9D, 8D, 7D in that order.  14 trump and in the non trump suits, 6 cards each rank A 10 K 9 8 7.  Crazy game.  Turns out a bunch of trump get used up while finding your partner.  Seems like every card has a meaning.  If one player has both black queens, they can say nothing and go it alone playing against the other 3 players, or call 'first trick' and the taker of the first trick becomes their partner.

Card values are standard for Schafkopf (A-11, 10-10, K-4, Q-3, J-2), with 120 points per hand.  Black queens must take 61 to get 3 pts, 91 to get 6pts, and all cards to get 12 pts.  Other two players must take 60 to get 3, 90 to get 6pts and all cards to get 12pts.  If I recall correctly, when someone goes it alone, they get 18 pts if they make it, and lose 18 if they don't.  If they go alone and take all tricks, they double bump to take 36 points, automatically out.

I normally hate trick taking trump games, but this game is pretty fab.  The small hands mean that it chops along and you don't have to suffer when your trumps are bled.

There are a number of clever devices going on here, namely a secret partner and specific trump cards up the wazoo.  As opposed to many forced lead games, I don't find this game constraining at all.  A few options and then a new hand.  Great.

I'll be playing this again.

[FX Schmid Blu Edition] {trick-taking, bidding, partnership, deduction; optimal 5p} Sheepshead is a fun and interactive trick-taking game. It is one of the few trick-taking games that is good for 5p.

I have to admit I'm biased here, having played this very often and knowing it for a long time.
After several thousand plays for a game with just 32 standard (bavarian) cards as components and still wanting to play more is an amazing testimonial for the game.
One play among experienced players is about 3 minutes and I'm still facing small mistakes (read: decisions where I decide wrong but could have known the right way beforehand) in my play from time to time, which can cost the whole game. These decisions should be lively discussed after the game with the other players of course :).

My only minor quibble with the game is the element of randomness. On the one side it's great and required of course because else you would not be able to get this insane amount of card combinations making every game different. On the flipside it introduces a big part of luck into the game, mainly on the starting hand. Games are often decided purely by the starting hand, leaving no worthwile decisions for the players until the next game. This only evens out with a large enough number of games playing many hands of cards. 

If you are OK with that and long for a short card-only game where you have to think and keep certain things in mind you really should try this!

I play three handed Sheepshead, using fairly standard American rules suggested in Wergin's book, *On Skat and Sheepshead.* The major addition is what Wergin calls "Olympic" scoring. You don't lose double after a missed bid, and scores range 3, 4, 5 for a normal win, schneider, and schwartz.

The game appears to be a fairly standard point-trick game. In many ways it is. However, the card play is tight and only gets tighter with experienced opponents. I enjoy the fact that I can squeeze in even a few hands in a short amount of time. This is a game that can be played casually, but that rewards skill. It's almost exactly what I want out of a so-called pickup game.

Great trick-taking card game. Especially with 5 players as it is 2 vs. 3 and who the partner is to the bid winner (picker) is determined by a specific card. That card is the Jack of Diamonds in our area.

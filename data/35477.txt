After 3 plays, including a 2 mapper scenario, I must say I thoroughly enjoy this system and the story line of the struggle of the army lines it creates.  The rout rules are especially brutal but not unrealistic in my opinion.  Some day I would love to play the full campaign.

Played a 5 player game. Took 3.5 hours. We won by the skin of our teeth. Not an easy game, but fun. There's a couple rules that seem counter-intuitive, like when you can trade an item and when you can't, but overall fun.

I bought this through GMT's 2012 fall sale, but mostly as a resource to learn about the battle. I find the system overly complicated and I doubt if I or anyone else will ever finish the full battle scenario. I am thinking of modifying the Glory system and applying it to this game.

First impressions look good.  Production is good.  Rules seem clear, with just the right amount of complexity.  The map won't exactly knock your socks off, but when the counters are added, it looks very good.  Large number of scenarios adds for replay value.

Good: ACW - Tactical - Medium / Difficult 

Great system, great and balanced tactical situation but not as spectacular as Three Days of Gettysburg. 
This really should have been a 2 mapper and I suspect this to be the reason that it is not so popular.

The Series Rules are in the best shape ever.  The exclusive rules are reasonably tight.  Dave Powell's research and inclusion of variant forces is fantastic, as always.

My face to face playing of the the first three hours of the full December 31st battle was quite enjoyable.  The 110 yard per hex map scale provides plenty of room for maneuver.  There are a number of one and two map scenarios included for those who do not want to undertake, or do not have the time and space for, the monster-sized, four map full battle scenarios.

I enjoy the game and it was my first play of the Great Battles of the American Civil War. I will play it again when I get the chance.

Needs a better command & control-system. Otherwise quite good game. I like CWBS and RSS better due to the Orders system though.

With four beautiful maps and plenty of counters, this is definitely an ACW monster game.  There are smaller scenarios, however, so newcomers to the GBACW system can easily get started with those.  This system continues to improve and hopefully they'll put out some smaller battles as it's tough to get enough time(and gamers who are interested) to do the full scale battles.

The walking dead survival experience game. Interesting survival horror story teller. I love the crossroads cards keeps the game fresh. Would strongly recommend the app Eric (Dice Tower) brings the cards alive, especially if players are not great spokes people.

Scenarios are nice and manageable.  GMT's version complimented with outstanding components.  The campaign game seems massive and I have yet to attempt it.  Typical, solid game of the GBACW Series.  The battle covered interested me into buying this game and I'm not disappointed.

N.P.Y. 
giving in to curiosity and a desire to own more ACW games.

That was disappointing as not all the counters you need are in the game.
Looking at who designed it I realised I've had a simular problem with a game in the past, designed by the same guy.
Seems like neither of us has learned anything, allthough from now on I'll avoid anything he's involved in.
Disappointed GMT didn't spot nor remedy the errors.

I love the two types of forest hexes--normal woods and cedar. Still, too big for my table, I fear.

just started the Hardee at High Tide scenario, I of course the Rebels. Not so good start , I put a good effort in hitting the Union as hard as I could all along the line(would like to replay it though differently). First turn all Rebel chits pulled and I am about to be hit really hard by the Union, not looking forward to it.
check back later

well I survived the Union first turn. Now second turn and I got the initiative again. My attention is to covering the entrance hexes of my re-enforements(Cheathams command). Which I have done with masted artilery. I am also attempting a breakout of the 3rd.Cav. on the Union right. Again the chit pull is not in my favor most activations are pulled. But I'm still holding my own.

Into the third turn now and I got lucky. Both union commanders pulled ones for there efficiency markers while I pulled a three. If it were not for Cheatham being out of command this turn would do me better. Hardees corp is hard pressed and getting very low in unit strenght, I'm starting to collapse to many units in his two divisions. Made a bad choice of not letting the calvary go to spoil the union right flank. I'm paying for it now. Believe it I'm still holding.

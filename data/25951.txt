GAME: The Castle of the Devil
RANK: 1681
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Based on 1 play with 4 players.
This was good to learn the rules, but wasn't that great in terms of gameplay.  We very quickly worked out who were our team partners.  Seems like more players would be required for a good game.

Next play with 6 players was better, working out who were the team members was very tricky.  But took quite a long time and some of the group really didn't like it.

Three plays in and I'm still not enjoying it much, but at least we are playing faster.

RATING: 7
The players are characters on a coach ride to the Devil's Castle.  Each belongs to one of two secret societies, with one trying to gain possesion of a set of keys and the other seeking goblets.  Your task is to deduce who is on your side, to obtain and hold on to the artifacts your society wants, and then to end the game by announcing who are your friends and which of them have your artifacts.  You start with very little information and gradually wring or trade more out of the other players.  

Kutschfahrt is a clever little deduction game that is best played with six or eight players.  The theming is original, while the card artwork is gorgeous.

Absolutely not sure what to make of this -- as the last game of Geekway 2008, I was tired, and the rules didn't go down easy. In the last quarter of the game, I thought I had everything figured out, and went on the attack, attempting to get a key or two from someone who was hoarding them. The people I had identified as being on my team defended my target! I thought I was just confused... but no, my target had two keys, the defenders were all on my team -- they just weren't sure about me. Argh.

UPDATE: Rating upgraded because this has stuck in my head long enough for me to be excited to play after finally getting it in an order from Time Well Spent.

RATING: 7.9
A very good backup option for players who have grown a little tired of The Resistance, Ultimate Werewolf, Coup, Mascarades, and other games with hidden roles and deduction. The Dueling and Trading, plus having to get the right objects and determine who is on your side, adds a lot of intrigue, even though the theme of the game seems a little wacky.

4 seems to be to few - we finished with a feeling this would be fun if there were more of us... 
[edit] 8 seems to be too many - most were bored quite a bit, 4 players went out of the way to help me become the sole winner (as I had the most cards, and was likely to end the game the quickest)

perhaps this would work with 6, but it receives 3/10 until I find out.

This surprised me - a lot. 
Hidden roles , secret deduction game with many twists. There really are some great cards in this game that add a lot of fun as they mix the game play up.
There is a lot to track:
Who is allied to who?
Who has the magic bags of secrets?
Who is collecting cups or keys

Lots of bluffing , interesting duels and laughter.

Best hidden deduction game I have played to date. Great at family events or parties.

Initial rating after one play with 6 players. I really enjoyed this game. It was different, and I liked the guessing and the huge amount of interaction. It also played fast, and the cards are beatiful. However, the game is very dependent on what the other players think of the game. Most of my fellow gamers enjoy heavier more strategic games, and this game is definitely not that. So, a great game, but very group-dependent.

RATING: 7
Nicknamed «The coach» because of its setting, The Castle of the Devil is a nice and fun enough social game: I would not advise to play it with casual and non gamers, for one needs several runs in order to understand how the game works and so to be aware of the endless suspecting the other players and peeping their cards. Otherwise, one would just spin here and there with no idea of what to do next.

Once you understand its mechanics - or at least you can guess what’s happening around the table and who your allies could be - the Castle makes an entertaining game: nontheless, I would still recommend Citadels over this one.

評分:ForLight:6 ForHard:6 複雜度:6 互婊度:7

這遊戲教學不難，但對於新手最大的問題是每個行動背後所代表的意義，其他玩家之間的戰鬥勝負，交易行為等等都是判斷敵友的要素，但要每個玩家都能記住這些行為及推斷背後所代表的意義似乎不太可能。而當大家都很專心玩的時候兩方陣營又會很快被劃分，變成單純的職業及道具決勝負，所以我認為這遊戲對於輕玩家或核心玩家來說都很微妙。

遊戲初盤：儘量讓其他人來確認或確認其他人的身分，透過其他人的反應來推斷敵友，比較理想是只看1人就能推斷出所有人的陣營（前提是沒有人當內奸），以及利用平手來阻止其他玩家觀看其他人底牌（特別是已知其中一人為敵人時）。
遊戲中盤：短時間內利用內易令隊友得到道具上的優勢，此時也不再需要互相欺騙了，努力的搶道具吧，確認聖物數量和持有者的身分是首要的任務。
收官：儘量不要讓對手搶手或阻礙宣告勝利，也需要注意有無玩家有獨立勝利的可能，黑珍珠變得很重要。


Home rules:
請務必拿掉典籍（Tome）不用,此道具會大大減低遊戲樂趣。

It may have been the time of night, but I just didn't wrap my head around this game until it was too late.

Great fun.

0.5 point more for the outstanding artwork; our game started very slow because (my fault) I didn't properly explain that Bags are fundamental to have new objects entering in the game; after we understood that the game went pretty well. I want to try it againg and the rating may increase

- update: rating decreased by 0.5 after a couple of more games; right now I'm doubting about its replayability

RATING: 7
Very enjoyable game.  The team concept is interesting, and the subtle ways you can screw with people makes the game very interesting.  I almost wish there was no way to simply look at another players allegiance.  It could have been a much better (and difficult) game if you had to work that out by inference.  Update:  down to a 7 after subsequent plays.   Unless players actively try to confuse people by bluffing (like I attempted our last play), the game gets pretty stale.   Am disappointed because I WANT to like this game more, but it's missing something.   I'm pretty sure the concepts here can be expanded a bit to make a great game.

I usually hate deduction games but this is different - It is deduction but with attacking and trades and somewhere out there people are on your side making it feel like a team game which it kind off is. Sparked loads of after game converstion. If I was to have a deduction game then this is likely to be it and probably will be it. so much game out of a small pack of cards. 4 Plays.

The idea is a little odd. You are in a coach and you have to "attack" someone to find their profession and alignment whilst everyone else weighs in on each side? In a coach? Three games with 6, 9 and 10. The game with 6 lacked any tension or uncertainty. The games with more were better but the gameplay is pretty random and whether you or someone else gains the vital information seems to be a matter of luck.

Went over fairly well against a pretty tough crowd who normally only play strategy games. But you definitely need the right group and mood. I don't normally like hidden role / deduction games, but this is not too bad in that regard. Once you start figuring things out, the pieces start falling into place. It's a little weird that anyone at any time can choose to end the game. Not to be played with someone who's willing to break the game and make their whole team lose. Oh, and having previously played Shadow Hunters, I have to say that this feels like a clear rip-off of that. But this is better, more streamlined, and no silly die rolling.

Group-think is a huge factor here. There is "dueling" where every player gets to suppoer either the attacker or the defender. It seems to me that early in the game it makes sense to support the attacker by default, since it's their turn. But the rest of the table always supported the defender. This seems in general to support those players who get chosen for duel, rather than a more balanced approach of supporting people on their turn. It can feel a little lame when you support people on their turn, and they don't support you on yours, even when they don't know whether you are the same or different alignment. Whatever. You win/lose as a team, so you don't have be the one to get it all figured out first. But it can be a bit frustrating for those who like to feel in control.

After 2 5-player games I'm not really convinced about this game. It starts out interesting when you don' t know who's on your side, but once that is obvious, the game just takes too long with card shuffling between the players, attacks with mostly unsurprising results. Maybe it's better with 6-8 players.

I played a 6 player game of this. Knew everyone's roles round 2, but gaming the cards you need to win is excessively difficult. A surprisingly technical game, and generally not what I'm looking for in a social deduction style game. Rules also unpleasantly quiet on what constitutes legal tabletalk.

I've heard this game is similar to Werewolf, which I've never played. It's a frustrating game: you need *some* information about other players to be able to intelligently act; but there is no way to forcibly guarantee you will gain information. The acts of players who "don't get it" tend to be random, which handicaps your ability to receive definite information, leaving you no option but to depend on your perception of players' motivation, which again, may be random. Since different players have different information, their motivations are further obscured by 'random players'. This is a game you only want to play with/against similarly skilled opponents: a newb in a game with veterans, or a vet in a game with newbs skews the game. Example: I 'won' the game by giving a goblet to a veteran player who had already tried to trade to me a goblet of his own, which I denied. I literally had no other definite information in the game because I was locked out of combats by random players. I reasoned: he was a veteran player (the only one at the table) and he had 5 items: he would assume that I, as a newb player, would automatically accept the treasure I needed to win, so he would not trade a treasure to me which he thought I could win with if I was on the opposing team. When he tried to give me a goblet, I denied it, and on my next turn gave him the goblet I already had. He declared victory for us via 2 goblets and naming a third player's ownership of a goblet (a player whom I had no information of). Sometimes, I can *clearly* not choose the cup in front of me.

RATING: 6.5
Takes too long to explain for such a light filler.

Interesting deduction game. I found it difficult to keep it all in my head - who had peeked who, and so forth - but it turned out not to matter much since pretty much everyone had the teams figured out by the end, so it was just a matter of making sure a team had the right cards.

I'm not sure that it won't boil down to that most plays, but the ride was certainly interesting.

EDIT: Happened again the next time. I think we aren't aggressive enough about declaring victory.

RATING: 7
One of the few good games that can be played with more than 6 players and really works well with 6 or more. My only complaint would be, that if once everyone is aware of the fraction of the others, the games loses a good amount of tension and tend drags a bit till it is going to be finished. Also the fraction with the better combat equipment and occupation can dominate the end game, resulting in frustration for the other fraction.

[2 plays] This is a secret-teams game, a bit like Inkognito.  First time out we played it with a terrible rules error that caused a stalemate.  I had to round up a whole new group of people for a second try after traumatizing the first group.  It was pretty fun even with 4, and I think this will be a good game as we get familiar with it.

RATING: 6
Enjoyable deduction game that would be great for social groups, except the rule-set might be a bit fiddly for party gamers.  Also, keep in mind that the game is more about quiet, tense suspicions and logic puzzles than chatter (at least until the game is over and everybody recaps what they were thinking).  Thumbs up  because it works with six, thumbs down because it fits in that time purgatory of being too long for a filler but too short and light to have a lot of depth, and perhaps questionable replay value as I would expect the game will play out similarly each time.

I screwed up our game by declaring victory while I had the black pearl.  What a dunderhead.  Not sure why everybody is in love with the art, since it's mostly drawings of keys and goblets.

Should be a good atmosphere game, and it is simple enough that you can jump into it quite easily.  Trouble is the game becomes repetitive very quickly as it is pretty easy to figure out who's in which affiliation.  The trouble is that getting the second part of the challenge can only be done through a series of attacks or forced exchanges.  Since most players know who's with who, the drama transforms into a drawn out affair.  Not too keen to repeat the experience.

A really neat card game that is sort of a cross between Werewolf and Bang. Each player is on one of two teams and must discover who are his teammates and ensure that his team has the proper item to win.

really fun, social game of secret alliances (some temporary, some lasting) with some good opportunities for deception.  each player gets a character card, a secret role card that gives a special ability, a potion that does something i can't remember, and an object card.   each person is also, secretly, a member of one of two secret societies.  each society has a goal to collect object cards of a particular type (keys for one team and goblets for the other).  on a players turn, the player chooses to trade an object card or attack another player.  the player that was chosen to trade can decline the trade.  Cards that are traded may have a special side effect when traded.  when a player choose to attack another player, other players will take sides by helping to attack or helping to defend.  The winner (the one with the most votes) gets to either take an object from losers hand, or look at their secret identity.

RATING: 8
This is just as much a race game as it is a deduction game. People slowly figure out who's on what team and then there's the race to finish, and finishing involves taking a bit of a gamble that your assumptions are correct.

This game is the best thing to bring out when you have a big group and you're looking for something with a very short and clean ruleset. There is some good interaction, psychology and trickery. Downtime is low, as you need to pay close attention to what other people know and don't know. Every game ends loudly and is followed by a flurry of chat as people collectively piece together what happened. The game scales amazingly well.

SUGGESTION: If you play with an odd number of players, use the 'fortune telling' variant. Otherwise the team with the most members will outvote the other team all the time without risk or repercussion.

An odd guessing/deduction deal. More structured than Werewolf, less stupid than Bang. Those games occasionally appeal to me, and so should this. In fact, I'd say it's probably better than either of those two, because it's so much quicker and doesn't overstay its welcome. It's a quite solid entry in a niche I don't play all that often.

Yet another take on the hidden loyalties style of game. It's not my favorite genre, and this game is a little clunkier than most. The endgame rules are both confusing and kinda random; players are required to collect a specific set of cards from the deck, so whoever manages to get it first wins. This might happen through clever maneuvering and deduction, or through dumb luck, either way.  You're better off playing The Resistance. (1 play)

I think this might be the only game that I've ever played four times in a row after having played for the first time.  With the right crowd, this is a great party game.  Those that enjoy Werewolf/Bang type games should especially enjoy it.  I'm not a big fan of the card art, which is standard fantasy fare, or of the theme (all this is supposedly happening inside a coach?), but it's a lot of fun to try and figure out who your teammates are through attacking each other and trading objects.  It really takes a game or two to figure out what you're doing, but after that point the game plays more quickly and becomes quite enjoyable.  Six seems like the ideal number, as eight might make the game drag out too long, and anything less would be kind of boring.

An interesting little deduction/hidden roles games. I was hoping that this game would prove as popular as Saboteur among non-gamers but that was not the case. It was pretty slow with 5 players (as players had to continually read text) and the game drags while players are waiting for the 3 objects to come into play.

I wouldn't mind playing again, but I think that most non-gamers would have a lukewarm response to this game.

I generally like secret partnership games and this is a fun little game if you don't take it too seriously.

There seems to be a couple of pitfalls in the game--making no progress in the early game and having one side overwhelm the other side when the game is still far from over.

An interesting take on co-operative gaming in teams unknown to their members beforehand. In the beginning it feels a bit boring, but as different artifacts start coming into the game and players get the information of whether someone else belongs to their team or not, things get a bit tactical and some finer nuances are also to be found.

It's a more involved large-group deduction game that definitely benefits from repeated plays, though the length and large group size makes that tricky. Some of my friends seem very good at understanding how to extract and/or signal information. With very large groups, it can be hard to follow the action at the other end of the table, and players less involved in the flurry of interactions may be left in the dark.

RATING: 6
A game about deduction. The goal of the game is to collect items for your secret organization without letting the other team know. There are some edge cases where game won't end. Even number of players recommended, though I haven't played too many games to really justify it.

In essence, this is a "team deduction" card game with a blind co-operative mechanism.  It's a semi-cooperative but you don't know who your team is!  Players are trying to determine who is part of which faction (two teams) by actions taken and using magic items and special powers to deduce who is on their team.  Winner is the team which has a member stand up and shout out in declaration whom they are aligned with, who are their fellow teammates and can display that they have acquired the necessary possessions required for victory.  If the declaration proves incomplete or partially false, then their team loses.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I enjoyed my first playing of this game with only four players.  It is a bit chaotic at times trying to figure out who's on who's team and where certain cards are likely to be, and the added element of a possible solo victory adds in a needed dimension where a team doesn't always work together.  I know I went after my teammate when I knew he had the solo victory card.  It needs to play quickly or it will drag, but its a solid group game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I enjoy Werewolf and like the secret identity mechanic generally.  Deducing my allies was fun and trying to locate the necessary object proved challenging.  There seemed to be something missing from the combat mechanism to me though.  I think I would prefer a very small element of chance to the combat to give the combat a little extra "kick."  Perhaps something like a die with 3 1's, 2 2's and a 3 that the attacker and defender could roll after the declarations of support were made.  The game was also won by someone who had the coat of arms.  Unfortunately, his teammates were hopelessly behind in the game as they essentially had an extra opponent.

I felt fairly meh about this game. I liked a lot of the ideas, and the concept, but once people worked out the teams the battles were pointless and the end game was kinda awkward.

This one really takes the right group. 

There's a smattering of inductive reasoning coupled with he blind guessing/attacking of Shadow Hunters and Werewolf.

At one point the facts are on the table and it's a mad scramble for someone to end the game.

Expect an uneven reception to this one.

Update:

Sloppy and un-fun. There are too many newer games of this style, especially The Resistance, that have really honed this style to a razor's edge with equal simplicity.

RATING: 3
Is this game ever painful to play! Felt like a mixture of Werewolf and Clue (which on the surface does sound appealing!) However the first half of the game is completely random (just like the first few lynchings in Werewolf), and by the time most of the people have deduced enough to mostly know who's on who's team%u2026 well the game's pretty much a forgone conclusion at that point; the decisions are obvious and it's just a matter of going through the motions enough times for one team to get all the right cards. I liked the attacking part of the game and the deduction "subplot", but the trading/card drawing/set collection just doesn't work at all. 
Nice concept, but not my cup of tea. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
[6-player] for what this game offers, a team-oriented deduction, it does a great job, has exceptional art and a fine theme.  Players are each on one of two teams (your teammates and opponents alignment is initially secret) and the team wins when somebody declares victory and can point out their teammates that are holding the necessary objects (either keys or goblets).  On a players turn they can declare victory, fight another player (to gain information or objects) or trade with another player.  Fighting is resolved by casting votes (various objects or player powers can influence the fight).  The trading mechanism is great because many of the objects, when the trade is accepted, spring a special power (which is the highlight of the game and where a lot of the deduction, etc. happens).  UPDATE: Knocking down a point as I had a terrible experience with this... the game is very dependent on the group dynamic.

Hidden teams, seems like it would be my kind of game. It isn't.

Xmas 2010 - dV GIOCHI English Edition ("Castle of the Devil")

Everything I love about gaming - backstabbery, intrigue, metagaming, alliances, yelling, name-calling, finger-pointing, accusations, and general nastiness. The secret teams mechanic is like BSG, only crammed into about 30 minutes. Highly recommended.

First two plays with six players. Loads of fun packed in such a small deck of gorgeously illustrated cards. Chaos and confusion (in a head-scratching, what-the-heck-am-I-doing way) abounds. We took turns to be the Bluffers, the Bluffees and the Clueless'es (those who had no idea even what bluffs the others were throwing around) .

A neat trick: attack your fellow and try to tip the balance, to exchange more than one items' information at once.

After just one play, I am not convinced b this game. The game started slowly with the choice of actions not being very effective in getting more objects into play. Once the players knew each others associations then the game became a lot more enjoyable with careful planning required to retain the winning objects.
This needs more plays.

This is a fun bluffing/deduction game with unique mechanics.  Both sides start out in the dark as to who's a friend and who's a foe.  Through some careful guesswork and well placed duels, you must ensure that your team gets the required objects to declare victory, meanwhile trying to prevent your opponents from doing the same.

It plays well with 6 and leaves me wanting more.  I would like to play this with more players.

like Once upon a time, Aye Dark Overlord, Are you the Traitor/Werewolf, the Resistance or any similar game, these are perhaps my favorite genre of game. They REQUIRE the right group. Right group is a euphemism for people who actually have some inkling of roleplaying, charisma, fun, wit, humor, exuberance, and amicability than this game wins wins wins. Which also means that if your group doesn't like these games, it might be time to get new friends rather than a new group because it's literally their fault and not the brilliant game.
--------------------------------
Update: Game has been played and I say this is a GREAT GREAT secret identity game. It has to be played with 6 or more players despite what the box says, but it's satisfying fun, different from traditional werewolf style, adds new elements and a bit more complexity without being fiddly or overwhelming. Tom Vasel and other people, despite being great, have not been fair to this game. It's different enough from Resistance that it's worth having both. I STRONGLY recommend this game if you have 6-10 players and you like werewolf or resistance. It's a great great game!

RATING: 7.5
There are quite a few hidden role games. Many of them focus more on confrontation or direct interaction, but this one focus more on deduction and reasoning, and I think this is the reason I like The Castle of the Devil more. But it is not a pure deduction game, it involves a lot of interaction too, plenty of bluffing and a bit of memory.

You need one game to fully understand how to use the cards. You won't need to read the text in the second one, but you will still need more playing time to master it.

It reminds me of Shadow Hunters, but it definitly packs more meat. 

It is scalable, but I would say it shines with 6 or 8 players.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Gameplay comes with a couple of flaws such as TOTALLY arbitrary attack and defense player behaviour in the first half of the play time. End game may get tense, though.

All in all, this game feels like kind of "Advanced Werewolf" (or "destilled Battlestar Galactica" on the other hand). However, it's worse than Werewolf due to playing time - it sure takes more than 1 hour for a group of 7 or 8 people! -  and lacks the thematically dense atmosphere and tension of BSG. If you can afford the time, play Battlestar Galactica with 7 players instead. Otherwise, this is the game of choice for a shorter time slot, but a similar experience, a lot worse though. If you consider a purchase: You get a lot of game for the price. Order this only if 5 Euros more or less don't matter to your wallets.

RATING: 6
Repeat plays has lessened the attraction that the initial "team discovery" mechanic leant. The start of the game is a series of random encounters, the middle has some interesting bits, but the trade / attack mechanism doesn't generate much excitement in the end game when the teams are known. Basically get as many cards as you can as quickly as you can, hope you get some attack & defense powers and hope everyone around you plays smart. Interesting enough for the occasional play, and has the asset of playing with 6.

This is one of my very favourite games. You can play it with 3 up to 10 players teaming up into two factions. None of the players knows though who his team mates are. Now the game mechanics is the great thing about this game, if you win a fight you can peek at the attacked players faction card, and all other players now start speculating according to your behaviour towards that player. So this game is all about giving secret clues to your team-mates when you know they are but they don't know that you are. And it is all about reading players' behaviour. your start to triangulate player behaviours to figure out who's who, and that is when the fights get ever more tricky, with players supporting each other, using items, to favour the outcome, and then another pulls out a great job ability and finishes the fight off with an unexpected outcome. The cards look fantastic and the game fits the theme like a glove. All this in a tiny deck of cards for a great price. I even bought myself a second copy since I accidentally drove over my first one and totally tore the box... mysteriously though, the cards are still in superb conditions. EXCELLENT GAME!!

This was billed as a Werewolf-style game, but it really felt more like a Clue-style deduction game, except that I couldn't write stuff down.  The goal of the game is really to figure out what each player's hidden items are.  In any case, the discovery process was way too chaotic for me, as most of the time players have no idea whether to support an action or not, and end up choosing randomly.  It's an interesting concept, though.

interesting groupthink game reminds me of a looser version of The Resistance.  most frustrating factor was that it seemed to be hard to get more cards in play.  this makes attacking the most efficient way to get information on other players, but if you don't have a good hand for attack, you're kind of out of luck.  luckily, our first game ended early; i was worried that it might start to drag.

First trip out with 4 and I think I can side with the general consensus that 6 is at least the bare minimum to play with, as it isn't that interesting with only 2 in each association to work out who your partner is; although one player was in the dark for half the game, as her partner had known one was batting for the other side and the supporting behaviour of the other player gave some indication of his allegiance. Confusing? So was this game, despite not using the occupations as I've now learnt to keep things short and simple to allow a reasonable good first impression. Thankfully following the author's advice to only use certain number of objects had no reference to the occupations, but still the game has such much text effects that unless played with the same 6 players willing to explore the subtleties in trading and in fighting over the various effects of the objects, there will be no one lining up for a coach ticket.

RATING: 2
A deduction game. 
Enjoyed the art work, but that is about it.
It has 2 distinct phases, which slowly develops as you begin to determine the layout. 
Figure out who is on your side - generally by using attacks - some times by trading.
Get the objects in play and to members of your team - same idea.
However, you can be locked out early and rely on observation, I would probably enjoy the game as much if I watched a bunch of others play it, rather than being a participant

To be effective must have an even number of players.

Ultimately my rating reflects that this style of game is one I generally dislike, and this one justifies my disdain.

The game takes a long time to get going, the initial 5 minutes are very dull. The limited action more or less nullify some turns. With four players, this is very underwhelming and I am not sure what to think of a card game that is supposed to work with as few as three but needs at least 6 to shine, it is rarely going to happen. Neat idea but the execution is a bit lacklustre.

This is in the family of hidden-identity within an alliance game. These go back to Guerrilla, Bang, and more modern versions include Battlestar Galactica. All of these games are failry sensitive ton having the 'right' sort of player as mechanical elimination of possibilities is boring and makes the outcome random. Kutschfahrt requires you to know where all the objects are, not just who your allies are, which is good. It can however take a long time to wrest control of the objects, and someone may crack and make a false accusation.

I really didn't like this - it appeared to be a deduction game, with some clever mechanisms, but in practice the deduction side was over very quickly, for most players anyway, and far too rapidly some players were shut out of the game entirely and unable to do anything - "Attack - fail", "Trade - fail" - forcing them to end the game with a random, and likely incorrect guess, just for something to do.  Nice ideas, but definitely didn't work in practice.

Good with about six players. The game is a ride along in deduction and light fun.

Players are members of two secret associations that need three objects to win the game.  The Order of the Open Secrets needs keys, and the Brotherhood of the True Lies needs goblets.  At the beginning, the players don't know who are their partners, and what the other players have in their luggage, but later in the game they will be able to make the proper deductions.  The game is won if a member of a team have one of the objects needed to win, and know who among the other members of his/her team have the rest.  There can be a solitaire win too, playing a special card.  Of course, if the guess is false, the team of the player who gave it loses.  Players have to play wisely and with some patience to avoid filibusterism against the game itself, which can be reached if a player decides just to play wild or to give wild guesses.  I believe that experience in the game would make me rate this game higher.

Elegant design that solves a lot of problems with hidden-loyalty games. No luck in information-gathering, with the only source of preemptive luck coming in obtaining items. The race to get items and selectively win duels makes the game remain interesting after all affiliations are known, which is rare for games in this genre. Every single thing you do is a signal, and you have complete control over what you do (unlike, say, Shadow Hunters, where you're restricted by dice).

On the downside, the game can take a while to get moving initially, as random attacks and bags fly around. Maybe if everybody knew one person's affiliation at the start?

Has the Clue dynamic where yes, you can go find out everybody's affiliation for sure, but you waste actions that others would have spent on searching for items. To get to the next level (in this and Clue), you need to interpret what [i]other[/i] people are saying and doing.

This is a nice deductive party game that takes a number of elements from Bang and Inkognito and makes a game in it's own right.  With the right crowd this could be played as a quick filler when you are deciding how to split up your large group.

The art and the cards are fun, and the interaction is high. I do think the beginning and the end are a little awkward as in the beginning you only have one card to work with and you haven't substantiated any foundation of who your partners are.  Some of the role cards are outright more powerful than others  so the beginning can get a little frustrating.  Once it gets going things are fine, until the game stalls when people are waiting out to see if they are safe enough to proclaim victory.  I'll have to play this more to see if this will always be the case.  If your partners don't have all the goods though it can be frustrating if you blow a win by a hasty accusation.

If no one actually wants to interact with each other this game could fall apart completely.

Seems only worthwhile with 6 or 8 players.

1 play, 4er.

I'm not sure what the devil's castle has to do with the game, but the idea is that players are divided into 2 factions randomly (and secretly). They are apparently riding in a coach (on the way to the devil's castle?) and must determine who is on their faction, and collect a certain number of items within faction members' collections, before the coach reaches the castle and the game ends. During that time, players are also challenging each other (with all players choosing one of the duelers to support), trading items, acquiring new items from the deck, etc. -- must be a really big coach!

Game play is pretty straightforward, but it seemed pretty clear that this would be better with a higher player count.

Quite an interesting concept and a novel idea for a game.  I like deduction games and here you partially use that mechanic, more in a poker style where you try to read the other players and they can try to bluff, at least early in the game.  The main problem is you can figure out what team everyone belongs to but still be unable to acquire the necessary cards for victory.  Also, I'm not personally enamored with most cooperative games.  I think the seeds are present for a great game and hopefully someone will develop a better one based on the ideas here.

Probably my favourite hidden role game. It's far less random than games like Werewolf or Bang, because there is no asymmetry to speak of. Fortunately, introducing a better balance does not make a dull game here. It's short, but not too short, and there are some possibilities for psychological play and deduction. You do need the right group to make it come alive, though.

An excellent hidden alliances game. Part of the Werewolf/Mafia family, but it's fairly unique in that both sides are evenly matched (ie, there is no informed minority). Everyone has their own secrets!

It has a solid amount of structure and game-ness that makes this less of a crapshoot than regular Werewolf, has no player elimination, and still manages to keep all the fun of a secrets and information game. 

Compared to Battlestar Galactica or Resistance, this game is one level more advanced - there is no default 'safe' behavior, which can make the early game quite impenetrable to the uninitiated.  

A great game, but NOT recommended for beginners to the genre.

Intriguing game of secret alliances.  Hard to figure out your first game; starts making more sense after that.  I don' feel like there's a lot of depth to the gameplay, but its fun.  Shadow Hunters is more fun and fits the same niche.
Update: The new rules improve the game a lot, especially playing combat cards face down rather than one at a time.

Eh, I don't know about this one. I think it has the potential to be a pretty decent game, but it didn't really captivate me like I hoped it would. I felt relieved when it was finally over because it seemed like it went on too long and got monotonous.

Very clever (mind) game. Tensed and fun in the same time. It has some issues though: it's not working very well with odd number of players and it can drag for too long with some people.

This game has an interesting catch in that players have secret (even to themselves) alliances, and figuring that out is a big part of the game.  For some reason, I didn't find it exciting in practice.

I'm not very good at this game, but I enjoy it. Everyone I have played this with has enjoyed it too. 

I have not played it with less than 6 players yet. With 10, it takes a little longer to get going, I think, but it remains a fun game. 

I follow the rating guidelines. My rating reflects the fact that I will never turn down a game.

Yet another winner from Adlung. Gorgeous graphics. Kutschfahrt has somewhat counterintuitive game mechanics (ex.: cards you give away give you actions). But after two games with 3P, all I could think of was:
"Let's play again!"
and
"I wonder if anyone else in this restaurant can be talked in joining? This would probably be awesome with 6-8P."

RATING: 7.5
Initial rating after two games with 5 players. And the game is supposed to be even better when the number of players is even (6 might be optimum). The deduction logic that is required to win a game of Kutschfahrt is similar to the logic in Werewolves, but I found the game to be less roleplay and more "game" otherwise. I need to be in the mood to play Werewolves, but I could play this any time. Other pros: The game takes less than 60 minutes to play with five, the rules are very straightforward once you start playing and the artwork on the cards is magnificent.
UPDATE: Played with six (of which I was the only one who played the game before), and we all enjoyed the experience, feeling the urge to talk about it afterwards. It is felt that the enjoyment we get out of it can only improve with subsequent plays, as people will have some knowledge of the cards in the game.

RATING: 6
After two plays: Cool, I liked it. It felt a little chaotic, as there's actually a fair amount to keep track of; who has what, what are each person's loyalties, etc. I'm hoping that with repeated plays things get smoother.

Update: This remains a fun but maddening design to get to the table. I feel like it really requires experienced players to really wrap their minds around it, newbs tend to just do whatever which can screw up the game length. Blood Bound has been received much better, but I and a few others in my game group have a soft spot in our hearts for this one.

RATING: 7.5
Fun bluffing game with hidden information that needs to be sussed out. Not quite deduction, but it sort of scratches that itch withouth having to break out pen and paper to make charts with. I quite like the trading mechanism. You need to trade away powerful cards to get use out of them, and you need to accept cards from people, thus letting them benefit, so you can use those cards again. I can see how this would break down if people don't see that they obviously benefit from making trades in almost all cases. The great art is the kicker.

After two plays, it seems that to really get the most out of this game, you need to play it fairy often with a group that knows it really well. It can take a really long time when people have to read every card, and it can also get unbalanced when some people get it and others don't.

Much better than The Resistance. I feel that there's actually enough information floating around to figure out who is on your side (and the faster your team figures that out and works together, the better off you will be).

It's not one that I feel that I need to own, but cool none the less.

Probably only really works well with a full group of 8.

Clearly a underrated game. Simple to play but the pluffing effect is more than expected. Your decision to support the attack and defend can be more strategic when you try to help your enemies. Nevertheless, I suppose 6 players is the perfect size (and should be minimum) to play

A very good game for a large crowd.  Very well carried out.  My only gripe is the small English font on the cards.  Some of the gang didn't quite get the strategy of how to ferret out your team, etc.  They lost . . .  Played it twice more today - I really like this one.  Kind of like Werewolf on steroids.  Lots of fun with great interaction.

Not a kind of game i like very much.
the start of the game is completely blind and chaotic, random. I don't like it.
We played in 5 and the 2 players faction was evidently disadvantaged. I don't like it.
It's not a bad game per se, but i don't feel like trying it again. You can like it if you appreciate bluff and paranoid atmospheres.

This is the same game as Die Kutschfahrt zur Teufelsburg, with a couple of tweaks.  Excellent medium-to-large group game with 2 teams of players competing against each other.  The catch is that no one begins the game knowing who is on who's side, and so the game amounts to a neat balance of strategy, deduction, and conflict.  Quick to play, easy to teach, but first time players need to go over the FAQ.  It is very important to be open to trades early in the game, and then it moves along brilliantly.

Quick game with 4 players, great with 6 players, *can* get demanding with 8  players.
A lot of interaction, but one should explain about the importance of trading, when introducing the game to first-time players.
One of my favourites, though it may be hard to win for the newbies, if experienced players end up in one group, while all inexperienced ones end up in the other group.
Usually well received by anyone.

Played once (with 6 players). Sure, the game is original and the cards are beautifully illustrated. I like the ideas of hidden teams and how you should deduce who your teammates are. However, the uninformed decisions at the beginning of the game can completely prevent one player from getting any information early on - and then the other players are likely to make sure he does not get any information at all. That is what happened to me in my only game, and although my judgment might be affected by this experience, I suspect this is likely to happen to at least one player in any other play as well.

Played two games with 8 players, one game with 6.

Like: The Castle of the Devil truly goes all in on the use of information as the central game mechanism. All of the gameplay is focused on deducing the allegiance of each player and the cards that they have in their hand. This is an admirably ambitious design decision, particularly because it's crucial that even allies within the game can't communicate anything with each other about the cards in their hands (except by offering trades or attacking one another). The game flows very well with 8 players, even if the downtime between turns is a little too long (as one might expect), which is a great accomplishment. Each player's turn is brief. The game is very easy to teach. The unique secret powers that each player range from cool to mundane, but they still contribute to giving each player some individual flavor. I like the clever mechanisms the game employs to facilitate communication between players; who you chose to attack (and who you choose to support) as well as what you offer to trade can carry an amazing amount of information for other players to decrypt. There's a tremendous feeling of satisfaction in deducing who your teammates are and where the keys/goblets are located so that you can declare victory. Lastly, I love the option to "declare victory" for the other team, and thus actually achieve victory for your own team. It's an ingenious gameplay option that ensures both teams are always roughly equally close to winning, providing there are clever players on each side.  

Dislike: The Castle of the Devil overcommits to its "information as gameplay" model. It's hard to draw the line regarding what is acceptable communication between players; ideally (from an internal perspective) the game would be played in complete silence with each player behind a screen. But that would be ridiculous, and would defeat the whole social purpose of the game. This tension regarding what it's acceptable to talk about at the table detracts a lot from the game, since you really can ruin the game by saying too much. There are also other strange quirks and imbalances in the game. The persistent secret powers feel so much stronger than the one-use secret powers. It's easy to get shut out of the secret bag trading circle at the beginning of the game for really no reason at all besides luck of trading partner selection, and having only one item is a shitty position to be in (especially if it is a bad item that no one wants to trade for, and everyone knows that you have this item: the sextant is a good example of such an item). There's also the strange graphic design decision to make the logos of each team on the role cards very large and color coded. This means that if you accidentally flip over your role card or catch a sidelong glance of another player looking at their role, that information is going to get revealed.

The co-op deduction aspect is a huge plus for me, as well as the hidden occupation and the set collecting objective.  Trading is cleverly utilized to reveal each other's secrets, and worked really well with some of item's abilities.  However, the whole character attacking aspect seemed very poorly conceived and awkwardly implemented, so much so that it produced a lot of down time and confusion for us.  The game is sorely in need of an official variant to get rid of that completely; it is a huge negative that tarnishes an otherwise interesting title.

Comment from Iron Dragon:

I don't understand the appeal of any of the crayon rail games, on turn 2 someone was eliminated because a bridge was washed out in front of him and you are not allowed to turn around and he had no money to rebuild (it was only the second turn) and so that was it, he was out. The end game was sort fun, but the 4 hrs it took to get there was worse than getting teeth pulled, I will NEVER play one of these games again!

RATING: 6
I think I may be tiring a bit of the rail games.  They are fun, but there is a *lot* invested in getting good card draws.  If you transport some spare goods from one side of the country to the other, you really need some good card draws to cash them in.  This particular map has a lot of cities clustered in the southeast.  I'm not sure whether that's good or bad, but it makes for a different game.  I may be rating a bit low because the play was with 5ers, and we had to call it quits (after 4 hours) and no one had reached 100K.

RATING: 6
Although I enjoy the crayon rails series in general, this is not one of my favorites.  The contracts are streakier than in most of the other games, and the first player to build a route often gets a big advantage.

I also think the requirement to build to Perth is out of place here.  It's so far out of the way that you often build a long route only to satisfy the connection requirement.  (I understand why the requirement exists, but somehow it doesn't work for me here.  Maybe it could be Perth *or* Darwin?)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Currently my favorite of the Empire Builder's series.  Even though Mary has beaten me five out of six games.  The grid printed on the side of the map helps immensely in locating the cities.

We played this one last night as a group of 6.  As two of the players did not really get the game concept it made for a long game.  As an experienced player, I thought that the eastern coast was crucial.  One player started in Perth and couldn't do well right from the beginning.  A lot of planning involved in this one and if you are not familiar with the overall cities and landscape of Australia, this one will be a tough one to play.  I think I would only recommend this for experienced rail gamer's and try to keep it to 2-4 players.

This is a tough map for the crayon rail system.  Long runs that are often a little too expensive to build to be really efficient.  The map also starts feeling tight quickly.  Worth playing if you want a more challenging version of Empire Builder.

Update 12/11/16:  Finally let this game go in a give away.  It just never made it to the table, we always choose Empire Builder instead.  I liked Australian Rails, it is just hard to keep the games that rarely hit the table.

I always feel that these crayon games are glorified card games. How often does someone carry an extra diamond on their train and immediately draw the diamond delivery card upon arrival on the other side of the map and go on to win. But hey, you get to use the crayons!

I think I like this map because I visited Darwin & Perth. Other than that, it's difficult because most of the cities are on the East Coast, but you must go to the West Coast to win.

Long playing, but still fun.  I tend to like ticket to ride better.  All of the rails games seem to have a key load to win.  Whoever gets the cards for that load early enough on, and delivers, wins.  The game becomes less fun after you discover the load.  Great way to let kids learn geography, though! :)

Played once with 3 players.  It's slow getting started with this one when you're not familiar with the map, and of course it takes a few turns to build up your line, but good fun once we got going.  Rating is partly based on my impression that the game improves with familiarity.  Downside is that the bits aren't so great.  The board could be easier to read and improved graphics on the components could make it a lot easier to find the right load for your train, but again, familiarity would help with those issues.  The cards provided to help you find which cities produce what goods are practically useless because the print is so small--not great for folks like me old enough to be losing their near vision!

RATING: 8
Many Australians might roll their eyes at some of the 'from an American perspective' elements in this game, and I am tempted to as well. For instance, you'd get into great trouble trying to export aboriginal artifacts out of Alice Springs, and Rockhampton hasn't produced any tobacco for decades (our contemporary social-engineering left suffers spasms if an anti-smoking advert isnt run every 15 minutes ). But these are all immaterial quibbles in what is a very pleasant game.

I like a train game, and this one scratched the itch nicely. It's a bit long, and the event cards dont seem to cause enough chaos, but I enjoyed the decision making and watching the figures go up. It is competitive without being cut throat, and strategic without being a brain-burner. The components are also quite good.

I look forward to playing more of this series.

My least favorite "crayon rails" game.  Demand distribution on the cards means that you can get cards, especially in the early game, that are unusable.  First player to get lucrative routes to the Western side of the board wins, almost without fail.  Might be more playable with public demand cards, but we haven't tried this yet.

RATING: 7.5
Enjoyable, a little perverse, and a great sprawling map that threatens to become our favourite of the crayon rails series. The goods distribution and city layout are as good as Eurorails and the few compulsory Event cards modulate the basic rules well without overtaking them completely. A couple of weaker rules implementations (not least the single ferry) are the only weakness.

You know the crayon rail games are so off the radar! If it wasn't for the fans here on BGG, I would have never known the simple wonders of the crayon rails! Australian Rails is our first experience with crayon rails! Just absolutely love it! We started with this map for geographical interest really, but the game is so well balanced and I can see it being very replayable. 

It reminds me a bit of TTR, with its tickets that you must complete! But this game seems to me, more strategic in connecting your routes for best resource delivery! Although you never know what future deliveries may bring! I love delivering a piece of citrus to a city for 45 million dollars or a bit of lead for 38 million dollars...that's the best part!! Outstanding 2-player experience with the Honeymoon rules!

To make a decent game and allow gamers the opportunity to build in the west and be profitable, the designers have had to include every 2 bit mining town out there they can excusably include. Which makes for disconcerting moments as two Aussies play and one asks the other "Rawlinna! Where the hell is Rawlinna?". I think there were about 10 towns I've never heard of, all of which have the population, sometimes literally, of 5 people, 2 dogs and a signpost.

I don't think you can win without starting with a solid platform in the east. I enjoy the economics of planning and building that crayon rail games offer, and look forward to each turning over of a new contract. This for me successfully counters the lack of interaction that the more-or-less solitaire mechanics provide.

RATING: 5
Its basically the same as the other Rails games with a few Australia-specific features like 'The Rainy Season' which floods large portions of the map.  Australia Rails has the challenge of an enormous desert in the center of the continent and a rule that forces you to cross it before you can win.

As you might expect, everything is pretty much up and down the east coast, but you're forced to build to Perth to win the game.  The Perth thing is a little heavy-handed, but I still enjoyed this quite a bit.  The hardest part of the game seemed, to me at least, not building to Perth, but crossing a ton of little tiny rivers that it's inconvenient to go around.

Where else can you make a diamond and uranium run? Great fun making do with the luck of the draw. Game runs too long with more than 3 players. The east coast connection of towns above Brisbane is extremely valuable. I like the requirement to go to Perth. I think ALL EB games should have such a rule. Note: It's interesting that the initial tracking building turns are the hardest in EB games as there are more options than once some track already has been drawn. This makes EB games difficult for the new gamer to get started, unlike many other games where the beginning is the least prone to AP.

Update: Dropping a point, just too much time lost in waiting for the planning of track builds after receiving a new Demands card.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Not as interesting as India or Eurorails. Part of the problem is the geography of the continent. The East coast fills up rather fast since that is where you frequently need to start to build up money to go West for the bigger payouts.
May need to try the variant where you can start in Darwin as well the major cities - wonder if it will open up the NorthWest.

I have played this only once, at the local club. I expected a long and very boring economic-style game, but this wasn't like that at all. It still went on far too long for what it was (a fairly basic pick-up-and-deliver game), and seemed luck dependent to a large extent. And I'm not convinced by actually drawing the rail lines on the board and wiping them off afterwards (they all seemed fainter than I would have liked), fun though the idea is. Not a terrible game by any means, but not one I'm in any rush to play again.

I got this for my wife (because its Australian) and was quite surprised that I found it.  This is my least favorite of the Empire Builder series that I have played.  I tend to do reasonably well at it, but only because I strongly resist the urge to go after big payoffs.  It feels like eveything is spread out and the only way to win is to primarily stay on the East Coast (except for the one required journey across the continent).  It's not that I particularly dislike the game, it just feels so constricted. [7]
------------------------------------------
I've now played this a whole lot more than when I wrote the above comment.  In fact, this is the second most played version of the series since I started logging game on the Geek.  I guess that alone says something for the amount of enjoyment I have received from the game.  Granted, part of that is because this is probably my wife's favorite map.

Still, we've played enough now that we can generally get a 2-player game done in an hour, which is good.  We have also recently picked up the boxed version for cheap.  Effect number one of this is that we will no longer be playing our dear, once collectible tube version.  Effect number 2, I expect, is that with the decreased set up time, we may play this one even more than we have in the past.

Despite all of this, there is one gripe.  It still seems to me, along with Nippon, to be dangerously susceptible to great swings in luck, more so than most other games in the series.  This is primarily because there seem to be a significantly large number of large payouts.  2-3 of these strung together and all of sudden you are over halfway to the total you need for winning.  

Despite this effect, I still find the game quite enjoyable, more so than originally.  I no longer find it nearly as constrictive s before.  I am not longer a die-hard East Coast beleiver, having seen various other strategies succeed.  That is a bonus in my book.  [05/14/2009]

I have a much longer comment entered under the tube version of the game.  That all remains true.  Having the boxed edition is a plus, particularly in regard to the load chips which have always been the most annoying part of the tube games for me.  I expect this one to remain an 8 for the foreseeable future.  [12/15/2010]

Another EB game. This one has some interesting east-west routes and as a result the map plays fairly differently from some of the others.

I adore this game so much! It is of course very long so I can't play as often as I would like but if you ever have an evening free this is a great game to play with friends. I love the art and gameplay and it's a very fun strategic game to play. I would definitely suggest starting out in the East side but if you play your cards right starting out on the West side can be good too.

New rule tweek = dry rivers/lakes, that become wet (normal) with an event card. Also, Darwin (a medium city) can be used to start building track.

1 play - got spanked, as usual!

I have now played all the games in this series except Iron Dragon and India Rails.  I like Empire Builder the best, especially with Mexico, then Australia ranks right up there with Nippon Rails.  They are all pretty similar so far, except for Lunar Rails, which is the only one I dislike. India or Iron Dragon is now on deck...

I enjoy the crayon rails games but they rarely get any playtime in my groups.Edit: they are starting to get played with greater frequency, but most of the newer train games I have played I enjoy more so haven't played many crayon rails lately.

I played the various crayon rail games when I returned to boardgaming back in 2000.  As I continued to play them, I found myself less interested in playing them.  Is it multiplayer solitaire ... perhaps.  They are okay games, just not great.  I would rather play something else.

Need to find a good replacement for the horrible crayons that don't draw on the board. Great simple idea for a game that is east to teach and plays well, although it does take some time, and there is always the element of 'Where is that town' and  'where can I get those goods?' Strictly a 2 Player game for me though.

Sold Expo 2015 - map too spaced out, and crayon rails idea is just a little too messy. I'd rather play Railroad Tycoons.

We have the new version. Have played with the kids a couple of times. Though a bit slow to get started, it moves along well in the mid game. Good educational value. Replace the crayons with Overhead Projector pens though.

A good Empire Builder game. The NW tends to be a little under-used, but so it is in Oz.

Empire builder in Australia. Good for learning Geography, but after that, a bit tedious, and too long.

See comments for Empire Builder. This map seemed large, with prime route on the east coast where cities are concentrated.

The concentration of cities in the east drives the game - when do you go for Perth? Good EB series game. Haven't played in a while. I reckon this is definitely a game where using the "public locking" rules will improve the experience.

Another entry in the [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/crayon_rail_games]crayon rails system[/url].  This is above average for the series, comparable to [gameid=168], but without the geographic familiarity for US folks.  There's a lot more traffic on the eastern seaboard, fitting for Australia.  The system is unchanged from the base game, which is both good and bad.  You still have the frustrating downtime, but the very satisfying building.

Using a specially designed board, you will use crayons to draw your rail lines. Explore the outback, build your rail empire across mountains and deserts to build a fortune. But beware dangerous sandstorms and flooding rivers as you stretch your rails across this vast continent!

Another great variant on the Empire Builder theme from Mayfair Games.  Tweaked just a little to make it different from all the rest of this train family.

A pleasant reduction of [b]Can't Stop[/b], with a slight twist: remove the press-your-luck, add a little [b]Sorry![/b] and some set collection.  Unique enough to keep.  Wish the scoring was a little simpler, but at least it only happens once.

RATING: 5
Though well-meaning, sadly the «Easy Play» line is full of disappointing games: Level X is one of those, even though it places in the higher band, i.e. among the better games.

Level X is a poor rip-off of many dice rollers (Can’t Stop in the first place) whose end result is unsatisfying and boring: it’s just a chaotic game with some interaction among players lasting too long for the kind of modest amusement it allows.

Builds on the Can't Stop concept of pairing dice to move up a column. Simulates six different games of king of the hill; players have to choose which battles to fight and whether to score points or to try to take over a hill. Mild complaint to the pawns that look like 3-D Xs but they tip over too easy. Still a great game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A good party-esque light filler game.   A lot more fun than I thought it would be.  A touch on the long side, but i guess if you really cared about that you could remove some of the tokens to change the game length.

RATING: 6
A fun dice rolling filler.  However, I'd probably only play again if I had the full complement of 4 players.  Since the goal of the game is basically to advance to the "X" of a number, and you can continually score a number until you get bumped by another player, it needs 4 players for there to be enough jockeying for position.  With few players, it's easy to just keep hitting the same number over and over without getting bumped.

Otherwise, fun stuff!

Excellent light filler game that my family enjoys.  Good math practice for the kids, and my husband doesn't balk at playing light mathy games so it works well all the way around.  I suspect that this game is best with the full complement of 4 people -- less than that  would likely remove too much of the tension of jockeying for position, though the bonus tiles would probably be more of a factor.  We're really enjoying all the games in the Easy Play line so far (this is our 4th).

This is a game similar to Can't Stop in how the goal is to make certain numbers, and the harder it is to make said number the more easily you are rewarded.  I think timing is important and you are very much at the whim of the dice.  Still, a game you can play in 20 minutes or so makes me very forgiving of the luck required to do well in the game.

RATING: 6
Fun little game, though nothing earthshattering about it.  The dice-allocating mechanism really only makes me wish there was some kind of press your luck action in the game.  I guess there's a little bit of that if you consider the part about figuring out which guys to leave and which guys to push forward.  I like the decisions about whether to go after the big point chips or to diversify to pick up the bonus points.

The huge problem with a game that is supposed to be "easy play" is the setup.  I try to leave the chips in stacks and not disturb the box, but if you had to separate and stack all the chips every single time that would be really annoying.  Also, the game lasts a little too long for my tastes.

Your guys are running up short corridors with buttons at the end, hoping to reach them and press them repeatedly like laboratory mice. However, a guy from another team who catches them pressing a button will throw them back to the other end of the corridor and they'll have to start over. Such is the gameplay of Level X, a surprisingly clever and strategic dice game. Fairly addictive when played online with automatically updated scores, though it is true to some extent that you win by rolling well.

The Schmidt EasyPlay line of games is pretty strong on average, and this might be the best of them all. Players roll dice to advance pawns across numbered tracks toward scoring tokens. As long as they rest at the end of a path, each successive roll of that path's number scores additional points. They can be knocked back to the start of the path, however, when another player advances to their spot. The game is easy to grasp yet filled with decisions thanks to the clever scoring.

RATING: 7
Remarkably similar to Sid Sackson's classic Can't Stop upon first sight, but sporting very significant differences leading up to a completely different flow and feel.

Most important is the absence of pushing luck: there's one single throw every turn. Besides, Level X does indeed use throws of four dice to add up values but instead of always adding values of two dice players have got more freedom, so they can use values of single dice or add up the values of all four dice. With the combinations of values in the dice players race up tracks the same well as Can't Stop, but the goal isn't reaching the end of those tracks: players must stay at the end of the track as long as possible to win point chips before they're kicked back to the beginning by the next player reaching the end. 

Thus, while Level X does remind of the old classic, it isn't a frantic and sometimes nasty race but a subtle tactical game that requires less combinatorial skills and more timing.

Despite being nominally a childrens game this plays well with adults, in fact with only adults I could see it being quite cut-throat.
Played in a mix of young and old it works well, the children are entertained and the adults not driven mad with boredom. 
The game is quick to play and well presented, chuncky cardboard and hefty dice
As a dice driven game it is of course luck dependant but, manageable luck - you can nearly always make something with 4 dice.

[Schmidt Spiele 2010 edition] {Dice, filler; set-collection, luck-pressing; scalable} This is a very enjoyable dice filler.  It's not totally luck dependent as one may expect.  Choices are still limited by the dice rolls; however, players can still choose wisely to get higher scores.  Player interaction is good. It's fun to kick out opponents' pawns :)

The game can end quickly with 4p, which makes the bonus tile essentially useless.  The bonus tile are only meaningful for 2s or 3p games.

The game components are nice: sturdy board, colorful chips and board, cute player pawns.  It's very good giving the price.

Push your luck dice game with a bit of chicken thrown in as you don't want to beat somebody to the X if he is just one space away from the X as you will likely only get one chip before getting knocked out.

Plays a little quicker than Can't Stop, plus players don't get blocked out of the numbers as quickly. Might be tough to catch the leader like you can in Can't Stop as a player only gets one roll per turn.

Really like the rule allowing players rolling more than one 1 to change it to whatever number they want.

Should have good replayability, but the level of thought required for the game is pretty minimal.

Enamored with Schmidt Spiele series of easy play games for a while. That has subsided. There a few excellent games in the series but level X is not one of them. This is a homebrewed version of the game. It has its origins in other dice games where certain combination of dice rolls allows you to advance and capture pieces or points. There are much better games in the Easy Play series starting with Los Banditos.

This is a cute little dice game that doesn't have a ton going on, but it has enough to keep the players engaged enough in the game.  Roll the dice and break them into sets of pips between 5 and 10, and then move your markers accordingly on the board.  There are a few decisions to make based on your roll and your board placement, but it's just about rolling dice, sorting, and moving.  This would be good for small families.

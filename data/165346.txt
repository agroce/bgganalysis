A quick and small filler that fits nicely in your pocket. It is not an amazing game by any means, but it is nevertheless a lot of fun. It isn't exactly balanced either, but compensates by having quick rounds (as they should be with this kind of game) and generally very little downtime. The theme is cute, and the concept of the ghost pirate is actually very interesting. The biggest complaint that I have with the game is that the rule "book" is a very fiddly and confusing bunch of loose cards. A small booklet or even just a rule sheet would have been much better. And just to nitpick, the doubloon looks an awful lot like a pancake.

Ordered it 2 weeks ago, got it in a few days, and then saw it on Board Game Blender - Tiny Games!

Always in my bag - it's that small!

This one can sometimes be played in under 5 minutes which means I don't hesitate pulling it out when at lunch.

Tried the solo variant here on BGG and it totally plays differently and is fun - that gets a 10 too!

A completely different game from Mint Tin Aliens and I like this one better. Maybe it's because this game is a head-to-head battle while Aliens is a card collecting race.  Perhaps I have some innate aggression to work out,  but that's my story and I'm stickin' to it.  Lots of randomness, for sure, but enough decision points to make me feel I had at least some control of my fate.

The luck part seemed like too much luck until I read David's blog post about it. Then it made complete sense. 

I think the back story would have been nice to include with this Kickstarter game.

This is a super quick, dice rolling, hand management game that plays in ~5-10 minutes.  I love micro games, and this fits in a mint tin, hence the name.  It's silly, but it's portable and just fun enough for the occasions when it is pulled out.

* Kickstarted *

Take out your opponent's pirate crew by turning in pairs, then rolling the two dice in hopes of matching the numbers on those pairs for a hit. Quick, portable, a perfect two-player game to pull out for 15 minutes of fun.

PLUS: quick to learn, extremely portable, fast, inexpensive, everything there
MINUS: play a few and you're done for a while

ADDED BONUS: came with Mint Tin Aliens — and is a different game entirely!

Neat little portable filler, but the extremely random nature of card draws and dice rolls has sometimes resulted in one player winning before the other player has had a chance to do much of anything.  I had to knock it down a couple points for that reason.  I think it would've been better to have a mechanic to manage luck a bit (off the top of my head, perhaps discard a card to reroll the dice, or play a 3rd of a set to make a roll successful).

Fun little 2 person game that can be carried around with you anywhere.  Great quality cards and fantastic little meeples!!  Simple luck based, minimal strategy game that can be played in 15 minutes on average.  It's a good way to pass the time without starring at your phone in boredom.  Worth the $20 I paid for both Mint Tin Pirates and Mint Tin Aliens on Kickstarter!

6.5 - Kickstarted and played a few games.  It's super light but the componants are suprisingly nice.  The cards are textured and the meeples are small and everything fits in the tin.  No complaints really, it's exactly what it says on the tin.

This game is great to take when you are waiting somewhere for something.  I occasionally like to play at restaurants; however, it can be a little difficult to clean up when food arrives.

I loved my first play of mint tin pirates even though I didn't win. It does rely on good dice rolls to a certain extent so there is a reasonable amount of luck involved though this can be slightly mitigated by card choice. A great game in a tiny package :)

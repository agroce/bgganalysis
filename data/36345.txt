RATING: N/A
Monty Python is best enjoyed on TV. As a fan I was rather let down by the fact that there was only one card featuring original Terry Gilliam artwork and that essentially the whole game revolved around "Monty Python and the Holy Grail". Too bad since Fluxx, in it's basic form, is a silly game. Not a very good one, but silly. I honestly think it could fit Python much better than it does. But I would bring it on a mountain expedition to the two peaks of Mount Kilimanjaro! 

...and now for something completely different. A man with three buttocks!

Update: After 3 plays - I hate this game. Now put up for trade.

RATING: 7
A simple, goofy game that usually has us in stitches laughing the whole time.  Can get a bit tiresome when no one has a set of keepers to fit any goal, and have to wait to steal or redraw some.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 1
[i]tl;dr Let's see, do you want to play a thirty second game or an hour-long game? With Fluxx, you'll never know! No real decisions to be made in this game.[/i]
[COLOR=#CCCCFF]____________________________[/COLOR]

Finally got the chance to try Fluxx and see why it's so polarizing. The guy who introduced it to me admitted as much. Surprisingly, he's a big strategy guy who loves Glory to Rome and other more difficult games, so I'm not sure what he sees in Fluxx. I guess it's the draw of all the Monty Python quotes. 

This was not my cup of tea at all. The game dragged on for an hour, and though I eventually won, everything was so random that there wasn't much of a point to any of it. Sure, I managed to get the right draw to change the goal card and win with a creeper and a keeper, but everything happened on my final turn and it felt like the entire first hour turned out pointless. 

I'm tentatively rating this a 2. Playing base Fluxx (without the Monty Python) could maybe someday raise it to a 4, and my friend admitted that was a very long game for what Fluxx usually runs. Overall, it was just too absurd for my tastes, and there's way better ways to spend an hour if I'm so inclined.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
There's almost no better piece of pop culture to adopt into Fluxx than Monty Python.  The randomness really ties in well.  As such, I prefer playing this one over the original Fluxx.

Want to play purely because it is Monty Python.  How could I resist that?  And I finally was able to play it!  Wow, it was exactly what I expected from a Monty Python game!  Silly, fast, and involving songs... I think I'm going to have to get this for my sister-in-law!

RATING: 4.5
A horribly random game that mostly serves as a way to kill time while being annoyed.  However, this gets much higher marks over others in the same genre of horribly random annoyingness (e.g., Killer Bunnies, Munchkin) because:

(I) Monty Python theme
(II) The misery ends in probably 35 minutes.

The game's humor is its saving grace.  The game is too chaotic and random to feel like real gaming.  It's a drinking game that can be played regardless of whether or not there's any drinking involved.  It is a casual game that can be learned quickly by non-gamers.

Gets an additional point for the Python references which match the silly gameplay so if I had to play a Fluxx game it would be this one. It's funny, or rather, the original source is funny.

+ I love the movie.
- This game is way more painful than the movie.


Why it's previously-owned:
There is nothing to this game.  It basically plays itself.  There are no real decisions to be had and it just drags on.

Funny little game and if you like Monty Python I believe that's a version of Fluxx that you should consider. With less players it lasts reasonable time. Nice for having some laughs with a couple of plays but not a game that is essential. I wouldn't play it with more than 4.

RATING: 8
Suprisingly this little chaotic game turned out to be the best game to grasp the "spirit" of Monty Python - it's dripping with theme thanks to quotes from the show and movies and absurd British sense of humour. I think it qualifies as a light party game, but the greatest enjoyment comes from playing it with the "right" bunch of people.

After 2 plays, this one seems to drag on.  The theme is great for Python fans (and I know many) but the special cards that require quoting or singing from Python limit the play appeal (my 10-year-old daughter likes watching us try, but can't participate).  This aspect of the game works  better in Mystery of the Abbey.

I think Zombie Fluxx is better done -- the keepers and creepers in that game feel more organic and fit together better.  I may prefer this one to original Fluxx.

Got at Hastings after reading a little bit about Fluxx, whose idea of shifting rules and goals intrigued me. I liked it a lot but that turned out to be unique to this version since when I later got the original I found it to be very bland. Monty Python makes everything better. Unlike Zombies. Or Cthulu. Or...you get the idea.

Flux is a game which is not easy to pick up with friends. It always takes one or two rounds to explain. But when everyone knows what the game is all about, prepare for some Monty Python rampage. For me this is one of the better itterations of Flux. Best played if everyone has seen Monty Python and the Quest for the Holy Grail.

I somewhat enjoy Fluxx and all it's craziness, but this took the craziness to a level that my group was just not comfortable with.  I could handle the silly Monty Python references, but the requirements of singing and speaking in outrageous accents are ridiculous.  A couple of the cards make no sense whatsoever.  Takes the chaotic fun out and just makes it zany stupidity.  I find that kind of stuff funny when I'm a spectator, not so funny when I'm a participant.

RATING: 5
Pro's:

1) Endless references to Monty Python, it is highly advisable to play this with people that like and can quote the Python films pretty much consistently.

Con's:

1) It is fluxx and the game never ends, the game works better with more players but then it ends up being a never ending activity.
2) Don't play this with people unfamiliar with Monty Python, they'll probably feel left out and not have much fun since there isn't enough game in there to justify them concentrating on winning.

RATING: 5
Decent, fairly quick, casual party game for fans of "Monty Python and The Holy Grail"

I'm not a huge fan of Flux, I keep it as a party game and/or for younger gamers (that are not able to compete in more hard-core games), however having a version themed after something you like helps.

MPF falls between Zombie Fluxx and Classic Fluxx... not as serious or challenging as ZF, but with more direction than the original recipe.  Creepers are not as devastating as in ZF, but they're also harder to get rid of.  Silly cards that have you sing Python songs and quote lines of Python material make MPF feel more like a party game for Python fans.  And don't forget to apply the lesson of Monty Python... never take anything too seriously, especially in a game where you can crush Robin's Minstrels with a Resting Parrot, give someone The Finger (of God), and reanimate the Animator.

Ok to bring places and for a fast game. It's just for laughs and should not be taking seriously at all. It's purely luck-based who wins. 

You really have to know your Monthy Python to appreciate this game otherwise the cards theme will be lost on you. 

Even if it seems easy to learn new players fast get confused when a lot of new rules are introduced so it's only a fast game when everyone has played a couple of games before.

The Monty Python theme is a significant improvement and an almost natural expansion for the Fluxx mechanic, but that's not saying much.  While I enjoy games where someone can win almost accidentally (see also Chrononauts, Strut or UNO), Fluxx is so arbitrary with its changes that it becomes an exercise in futility and frustration.  Why bother trying when the rules, goals and purpose will change three times before you get to play a card?

Others may bestow the honor to Munchkin, but for me, this is the game that is best played by leaving it on the shelf.

It's Fluxx, it's Monty Python, it's Insane!

Seriously, if you've ever played Fluxx, then it's the same principle. Rules change, goals change, fun remains. It's more centered on the Holy Grail movie than the actual TV show itself, but it's amusing nonetheless.

The outrageous accent rule can be quite difficult at times if you're unprepared.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
As much as I love this version (for myself it's at least an 8), there are a few cards that make it difficult to play with people who aren't familiar with Python. If their only exposure is Holy Grail, they should enjoy it, but knowing most of their Flying Circus repertoire makes a couple of the cards a LOT more useful. (I'm looking at you, song card.) The non-fans I played with were rather confused by cards such as "My hovercraft is full of eels" even when the gameplay effects had nothing strange about them.

TL;DR: Great for Python fans, if playing with non-Pythons use a different version.

I especially love the rule card that encourages you to talk in a funny accent. Give me a beer or two and that rule card, and I'll be having a blast, win or lose!

Monty Python level silliness in a card game.  There is no better delivery than Fluxx.  This is a favorite of mine.  The mechanic in this one is that multiple knights of the round table can be used on certain goals.  Get the castle expansion and let yourself be taunted by French Persons.

I now think I understand the less than charitable attitude that many on the Geek have toward Fluxx and it's descendents.  'Tis a silly game that makes no sense.  In fact, if it wasn't for the Python theme, I probably wouldn't have liked it at all.  OTHO, silliness is what Python is all about, so it seemed to "make sense", as it were.  

Unfortunately, not even Monty Python can really save Fluxx. Time for this to take a "silly walk" to someone else's collection.

Traded away in my most unusual and unique trade ever.

We enjoyed playing this - it's a fun 'take-that' kind of chaos experience game which fits the theme perfectly. Without the theme I doubt I would enjoy this as the underlying game is just too chaotic and does not allow for much coherent strategy.

A Monty Python re-themed version of Fluxx that I had the misfortune to sit through an hour of, in a five player game.  Never again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Not nearly as well done as Zombie Fluxx.  It seems like the knight goals are a little too easy, which leads to shorter (i.e. more random) games.  And the singing and outrageous-accent New Rule cards make my eyes roll, though I appreciate that they are optional rules (i.e. you only get a benefit for complying, rather than the rules being mandatory).  I like the newer box style, though not as nice as the Amigo boxes, but the cards are really disappointingly flimsy.

The iPad Fluxx game has turned out to be more fun than the card game, for me.  I think it's because it's easier to make a mistake with the card game.

Fluxx is the kind of game I'd imagine coming from the slightly deranged minds of Python-ites so this version based on Monty-Python's hilarious sketches and films is like an eel to a hovercraft.

Very similar with other Fluxx game, but this one is more fun to play because of the humor. It's the first Fluxx I've played with creepers, which seem to make the game longer. I prefer my plays of Fluxx to be short. This is not a game I would suggest, but I would probably not say no to a game either if it was the thing to play.

Tendency: The Fluxx games in general can get a lower rating, but not at this time.

RATING: 5
If I could do without one version of Fluxx in my collection, it would be this one. While some of the action cards are amusing, what I don't quite like are the cards that directly benefit fans of the comedy troupe. Given the theme it only slightly makes sense, but at the same time it doesn't quite make for a broadly appealing game. Thankfully, the randomness does mean that the benefits aren't necessarily advantageous. Still, this is currently my least favorite version of Fluxx.

Clocking in at about double the price of regular Fluxx, clearly due to licensing, this version introduces even more annoying rules than your typical game of Fluxx. Cards requiring you to (or at least giving benefit to) singing, talking in funny accents, and knowing Monty Python trivia are generally more annoying than fun. Still, the goals here are interesting, incorporating the Creeper rules from Zombie Fluxx in some creative ways. If not for the annoying cards, this would improve regular Fluxx. As it stands, it's kind of a wash. Zombie Fluxx is better.

With the cast approaching retirement, Monty Python seems to have entered an exploitative phase in recent years, seeking to squeeze old material for as much profit as possible.

Okay if you play it for what it really is - a filler until your next main game starts, or while you are waiting for the rest of your game group to show up. Hate how there really is not strategy that helps - you can go from nothing to winner with literally one card draw.  If you are a huge Monty Python fan the game will be enjoyed simply because of the fluff. Not enough strategy for me, and I might just enjoy a game of war better. ;gpv;10;3

I love Fluxx and this is the perfect theme to go with it. Monty Python fans will love it and the different keepers, creepers and goals work very well. Not so many themed rules or actions, but those that are there are fun. Great for a fun and silly filler!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Holy Grail comes alive in this edition that abandons stereotypes (like in the other versions) for Python-specific winning conditions and rule changes -- know what I mean? Nudge, nudge. (So don't wait for your idiom, grab a bunch of coconuts and let loose!)

HUGE PLUS: theme adherence, chaos level
PLUS: involves players more than any other version of Fluxx
MINUS: not good for non-Pythoners and dead parrots

Bought at GothCon auction 2009. I don't nomally like Fluxx very much, but as others seem to enjoy it I thought I'd get the Python themed version, to lessen my occasional suffering...

6 players: suffer with pride. As the keepers are diluted, the chances of someone actually pulling off a win seems to go down. This particular game dragged for about an hour. Far too long for what Fluxx is :-/

Exactly what you would expect from it. Most of my group had actually never seen any skits/movies by Monty Python and this surged an interest.

Yep, this is typical Fluxx with a different theme.  There was one new type of card with creepers.  Creepers you must play immediately down to your display and you cannot win with them in your display in most cases.  Again, not the type of game I will usually play happily but will from time to time.

Random =/= fun. This game can be really great at times, but maybe once in 3 plays. The issue is the number of cards that force you to play or draw huge numbers of cards, leaving you with far too many or too few options. There is a sweet spot, and when it hits it is good. I feel a few more silly cards getting you to talk in accents or do quotes would give the game more flavour.

“Nudge, nudge, wink, wink. Know what I mean?”

I can only repeat what I said previously about Star Fluxx. Being a fan of randomness helps a lot for me so I definitely enjoyed playing Monty Python Fluxx.  I have no doubt that my non-gamer friends who enjoy Monty Python will enjoy it as well as I will be able to teach it within minutes. That is a great point for me as I will use it with non-gamers as some light fun which doesn’t take too long. I do like the changing rules and goals as you do have to stay on your toes and it is also a great equalizer when playing with serious gamers who like to plan things out and look for optimum strategies. Having said that, I think that they are less likely to want to play. For me, this is my favourite of the Fluxx games as I love the theme and can easily add to it. Others may like the theme to have a bit more depth but this just wouldn’t fit the Fluxx model so like Top Trumps, the theme is pasted onto the core mechanics engine which purrs along nicely. A fun experience with a fun game.

For an easy, brain-friendly family game, Monty Python Fluxx works very nicely indeed, squire.

Definitely the best version of Fluxx. It gives the random silliness of the game a theme that matches its mechanics. Best of all, it gives bonuses if you speak in silly accents, sing Python songs, quote the movies and skits, etc.

No one expects the Spanish Inquisition . . . but you can expect that this plays the same as Fluxx . . . its still Fluxx.  I do like this version better.  It feels more like a complete game.  I think it is primarily due to the theme.  I like the theme (even if it is just stapled on to an existing mechanism) and it seems add some "purpose" to the endeavor.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Another dreaded novelty card game, Fluxx involves spiralling card combos until someone randomly gets the right cards to instantly win.

It is completely out of contol, random and chaotic, with a mild screw you factor. Like Zombies!!! but as a card game. It can be over in two turns or go on for far too long.

The Monty Python theme is obviously a plus and this most likely would have been a 4/10 without it.

Good for a group of drinking, casual/non-gaming Monty Python fans, but there's not a lot here for the more serious gamer.

In my opinion there are two playable versions of Fluxx: Monty Python Fluxx and Pirate Fluxx. The secret is the level of campiness: they're the versions of Fluxx that are 'so bad they're good', as opposed to "so bad it doesn't make sense".

Not as accessible as the other Fluxx variants.  Need to be a full-on Python fan to get all the references.  This is the point of course, but if you think you're a fan because of the movies...you'll find out that you're not.

Monty Python is brilliantly suited to Fluxx, and the game plays just as surprisingly and erratically as you'd hope.  Thankfully, the sort of person who'd want to play Fluxx is also likely to have at least some awareness (if not familiarity or outright love) of Monty Python, making this a shoe-in for its target audience.
As with any Fluxx, the game could survive only the first round, or beyond an hour - arguably being more than twice as long as necessary.  Second time through a re-shuffled deck is decidedly samey.

Having owned Fluxx, Eco Fluxx, and Zombie Fluxx, I feel like Monty Python is the ideal realization of the lunacy after which Fluxx strives. For a mindless activity liable to induce jokes and stupidity, look no further. For a game with actual stakes or meaningful interaction? Look anywhere else. 

Approved.

Like any Fluxx variant, there isn't much here in the way of strategy or gameplay, it's mostly just trying to laugh at ridiculous things that might happen.  Here, the Monty Python theme would appear to be an asset, but I've found that it didn't really increase the humor quotient by that much.  Like many newer Fluxx variants, this game includes "Creepers" which prevent people from ending the game.  Since the game is supposed to be fast and light, preventing people from ending the game is not a positive.  It's particularly bad when multiple people draw them in their opening hands.

My first and last Fluxx to play. Totally pointless cardplaying with enormously frustrating mechanic. Ok, it's easy: draw a card and play a card. Everybody needs just to play since winning conditions are unknown and will change during the game almost all the time. Don't really see why these games have been made...

The only positive side is the theme. It's funny to see all the familiar stuff from Monty Python (especially from Holy Grail). But still, it won't make this game any better. Please stay away from this...

This is a funny filler game with loads of Monty Python nostalgia.  It doesn't really seem to have much strategy or thought to it however, mainly just playing the silly cards and laughing at the "outRAGious ACKsants!"

RATING: N/A
I'm not the biggest fan of Flux, but even I have to admit that the Monty Python edition is funny. The definitive edition of the game for sure, it's still good for laughs every now and again. It has all the same problems as regular Flux: game length is super-short or super-long (with no control over which one in any given game), strategy is so basic it can be played on autopilot 90% of the time, managing your goal cards so that your opponents don't win is annoying, no fun, and a headache, and somehow, despite all this, experienced players have a distinct advantage because they have more of the goal cards memorized.

Yet Monty Python Flux takes the worst parts of Flux and makes them funny. There's a lot of value in that. Ok, so the game can still drag-I played a game of Monty Python Flux that lasted an hour and a half, and only ended because somebody intentionally played a goal that made somebody else win because he wanted to stop playing. Still the jokes on the cards are good (way better than Munchkin), and anybody can play, so it's not all terrible. And the ability to deal players in during the middle of the match is one of the greatest mechanics in board gaming history. Shame it has to exist in a game so devoid of strategy, but just accepting things as they happen can definitely increase enjoyment of this game.

Monty Python is a perfect match with Fluxx because they are both so random while having an underlying structure that does give them coherency.  

Monty Python Fluxx also has a better balance between Keepers and Creepers than Zombie Fluxx did.

Not really worried about just how bad Fluxx can be or is or whatever. Being able to laugh at all the cards as you play is so much fun. Theme and card instructions seems to work really well.

Fluxx? The only way to describe the rule changes is by comparing it to being a high school kid playing the drinking game Quarters.

Now that the Monty Python jokes are entering their fifth decade, they're really showing their age.  If you're new to the genre this is fine, but anyone with any previous Fluxx or Monty Python experience will find this to be a retread of no significant value.

It's fluxx, with a Monty Python theme. A good excuse for all the much-hated quotes, jokes and other Pythonesque horseplay which occurs at every gathering of geeks to get it out of their system and over with.

This is really a game that should have a rating of 5, but the theme of Monty python is my cup of the and makes it a better game than it actually is. Ordinary Fluxx have nothing to going for it compared to mp-fluxx. If you like fluxx, play this version. If you like me, mostly feel sad about people who have to play fluxx, and mostly tries to avoid that game, remember Monty Python Fluxx is better because it is fun, it has humor, even though the humor is references to Monty python. Will not buy this game.

Still, anything Python and anything suitable for two players has my attention, so we bought it. Later we jumped into a game without reading more than the three basic rules and had a great time. The Python aspect probably helped because it adds a layer of conversation and built-in silliness that fits the mechanics of the game without feeling at all forced or cliche. I wish the trend to make endless thematic versions of Monopoly was instead applied to Fluxx. (Fluxx for Big Bang Theory? Gardening? Disneyland? Deal me in!) If I have one criticism, it's that I would've liked more Life of Brian references, but that's true of any conversation or activity that touches upon the Pythonverse.

I love Monty Python and their brand of sillyness.  Fluxx is quite a silly game so this works for me.  This is the only Fluxx I will play.

Played this a couple of times at our local game store on a date night with my wife. We ended up buying the game because of how much fun it is to play with two people. We took the game with us on vacation and played with family. We had an awesome time playing and laughing at the Monty Python jokes. Worth buying!

RATING: 6
As far as the game is concerned, this is almost identical to Fluxx, and therefore equally interesting. But if you're into Monty Python (and which geek isn't?), this defenitely is the version to play. The silly humour of Fluxx and Monty Python just beg to be combined; it's almost as if Fluxx was designed with Monty Python in mind. One minor quibble is that the Holy Grail is the source of 90% of the jokes. MP has made so much more great stuff!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
No other Fluxx game is needed.  Throw them away.  If you're going to play Fluxx, get this version.  Monty Python is silly enough to support a game where the rules are constantly changing.  I would guess that the theme is 80% Quest for the Holy Grail, there are still enough Flying Circus elements that true Python fans will get.  My favorite objective card: The Cheese Shop (you win if, at the end of your turn, you are the only one with no cards, no keepers, and no creepers).

RATING: 5.75
This is a casual, luck-based game. It has great themeing but is perhaps a little too crazy for its own good. I think that the goal cards are both too simplistic and too numerous among the deck. There should be more emphasis on changing rules than on changing goals, because presently a game can drag on, just waiting for someone to win by chance.

To account for this I randomly remove some of the less funny goal cards before playing (in inverse proportion to the number of players) and allow there to be 2 goals at the same time (or 3 if the card to allow 2 is played).

While I enjoyed playing the game, and consider myself a pretty solid fan of Monty Python, one must consider the idea of "too much of a good thing."

Played this once with a group of people with varying degrees of exposure to Monty Python. A couple of us were very familiar with all the movies as well as the TV Show. Some had only seen Holy Grail and/or Spamalot, and others were merely aware of the shows'/movies' existence.

The biggest issue that I had with it was that the theme didn't really add anything to the game, except a couple of new rule cards. Not unexpected for something of this nature, but a little disappointing nonetheless.

Speaking of the new rule cards, most of them were forgettable. Except the one that makes you sing every turn. That quickly gets both annoying and frustrating, as you only get the card bonus if you come up with a new song. But people who aren't familiar with all of the shows are unable to come up with many songs beyond "The Camelot Song" or "Always Look on the Bright Side of Life."

All-in-all, I'd rather play the original or Zombie Fluxx.

[thing=36345][/thing] is, basically, [thing=258][/thing], but with different jokes. The rules are: draw a card, play a card. No way to win from the get-go. The cards played add new rules and goals (the win condition). Other cards have actions, keepers (usually cards that are required to win the game) and creepers (usually cards that prevent the player from winning).

A game cand last anything between a few minutes to a full-fledge semi-eternity (around one hour). The inside jokes are something I enjoy immensely, but I can't say they will hold up for many plays - this is, really, a minor issue for me, since I will probably only play [thing=36345][/thing], two, maybe three times a year, since the owner is a friend that doesn't show up in our regular meetings. However, considering the other Fluxx games, the game probably won't stay fresh for if the game hit the tables in a regular basis.

The mood for the game is proper with the theme - it fits really well. The artwork is cartoony and does the job pretty well also.

My biggest complain stays in the matter that the game isn't good enough to last more than 15-25 minutes. In this small frame of time, though there are better options around, I will accept, and even have fun, with [thing=36345][/thing].

Fluxx itself is a nice filler game and nice gateway game for people who have only played traditional card games.  I have a more in-depth review on Eco Fluxx.

Monty Python is nice as far as theme goes, but I would not suggest buying this unless everyone you want to play with is familiar with Monty Python.  There are a few cards that will require you to do certain things (like quote a movie or sing a song), which will be frustrating and unfair for anyone who isn't familiar with it.  Alternately, search through your deck and toss those cards aside any time you're playing with people who won't know them.

Games that make me sing or otherwise make a fool of myself I tend to get a bad first impression of. I think Fluxx is a fun system and there are tons of laughs to be had. The other versions are just as funny but don't make me stand on one leg.

I can get into those physical games if that's the main method of gameplay, it's just weird being interspersed into Fluxx.

Look into the other versions of Fluxx if you want to play Fluxx. If you like monty python this will do just fine.

I might have finally found a Fluxx variant that I like a little more than the original.  I think this will only be true with a group of Python fans as each and every card brings out a quote, song or chuckle.  Also, I found the Creepers less annoying than in Zombie fluxx as they were both funnier and more likely to be involved in a goal.  If my vanilla Fluxx ever needs replacing I'll probably look here!

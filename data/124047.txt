I feel this is a good dice adaptation of [b]Roborally[/b].  I'm glad they decided to use non-similar dice in order to better simulate the card experience.  This game did everything I hoped it would do: streamline the original into a shorter, simpler game but still deliver nearly all the same thrills.

Rating should go up, as I only played the base game.

RATING: 8
Fun game. 

I will always enjoy playing this, but it fell short for me in a few areas:

-if a player gets out in front, it's hard to reel them in; more often you end up treading on each other's toes at the back.
-the blocks are frugal, but anything resembling a ship would have been amazing; it doesn't really justify being above the Print and Play with the component quality. 
-some of the rules are surprisingly clunky: the rum barrels for starters. 

It's a fun game, it just feels like it could have been better.

One quick play of the basic game was fun. I would try the more advanced game if taught.

RATING: 3
I love RoboRally. This has RoboRally guts but is significantly less fun. The 5x5 boards compact the play area too much. The boards have too many elements. Only having 6 dice is too limiting. Getting locked in on moves after taking a second point of damage is too punishing. Rules are poorly written. The ghost ship is a really fun idea but it is too strong since it switches boards to follow you and fires after every bell. It makes it impossible to lower sails and recover damage if you have the treasure since you opponents will use it to destroy you. The most redeeming quality is skulduggery. This game needs a major rules overhaul to be enjoyable. I'd play RoboRally 10 out of 10 times when choosing between the two games.

Enjoying this even more than roboderby. Love the theme.

RATING: 5
One of the chief complaints about Robo Rally is the component quality, so I was disappointed that this game came with printed dice that will wear out quickly. Using dice instead of cards is a nice innovation, but the maps are also so much smaller and simpler than Robo Rally. I definitely recommend the variant where you pick up the treasure and carry it back. Overall: doesn't replace Robo Rally.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A great idea but a little too chaotic for me. I find the game to be a waste of time with 2 players, as whichever player rolls better can just shut the other player down for the rest of the game. Would player again but needs to be in the right circumstance.

RATING: 6.5
Good for three or more, a clever game of dice rolling and outwitting the choices of opponents.

With two players, it's quite barren and not much in the way of satisfying, but with more pirates in the waters (4 players is really its sweet spot), it's a worthy pirate filler.

Saying I played this is somewhat generous. I played for a few turns and abandoned it. (However, we were playing with a fifth player, which makes things even more chaotic). This is not to my tastes, but isn't terrible. Probably better with 3.

Rating -- Indifferent.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is a fun game. First, the overall component quality is excellent. It's a simple art design that works with the pirate theme. Second, it's a great option to scratch that programming actions itch. I don't tend to like games like that much, but even with the luck of the dice, the player interaction options often give you ways to slow or mess up the ship in the lead. I played this with my 16 year old daughter. At first, she was annoyed as I explained the rules, but we both really enjoyed it. It's a keeper for sure. I think it would be best with 3-4 players, as we didn't really ever hit each other with our cannons, but it played quick and there is very little down time. As side note, I would not choose this game as the finally of the night. This is more of a casual quick game that could be used as filler or a warmup to something more complex. It sets up so quickly, takes up so little space, and plays so fast that I would be willing to grab it and play any time.

It's fun enough, but too chaotic for my taste (and that of most of the people I play with). Once ahead by more than a couple of squares it's very hard to catch the leader, and the interaction between players means that the game tends to outstay its welcome before one player gets ahead enough to win.

Roborally the dice game takes on a pirate theme? Ok, sure, I'm on board for that. So the fun of this game is watching when things self-destruct despite the best-laid plans. The problem with that is the fact that it doesn't happen all that often. Even if one person's ship gets sabotaged there are usually at least 2 others that slip through without getting hurt at all, and it ends up being a race to see who can roll the more useful die results. Yet this might be remedied by playing one of the longer versions of the game. This is a good design and there are lots of interesting decisions to make during the rolling/programming part of each round. I will gladly play this if it is suggested, but it's not top of my hotness list or anything like that.

It's sort of a programming party game (there's a lot of "take that"), but if you play with the "take the treasure back home" variant it overstays it's welcome.

Full Disclosure: I have been involved with the creation of this game and its predessor (RoboDerby).  I have received no remuneration or funds as a result of this involvement, just a lot of late nights Skyping with Clint.

Fun little dice game that feels like RoboRally without having to set everything up.  This is a pirate retheme of RoboDerby with more damage (ramming and broadside cannons instead of forward firing lazers) and a different goal.  Instead of racing around the course, the goal is to get to the treasure and back home to the port.

This is a dice game, with different commands on the dice.  Dice means random, but for a short game, that's not an issue.

I find this best with 2 or 3, 4 players can get a bit crowded.

Getting two copies from the Kickstarter, even though I have a prototype set, because I really want the wooden dice.

OK, so it's RoboRally with pirates. It's thankfully much shorter than RoboRally, is far more portable and easier to set up, and plays better with only two people. The bits are nice and the theme is great. Zero points for originality, but I'd actually rather play this. Never played RoboDerby Express.

This does really seem like a dice version of RoboRally, and somehow simpler. It has the chaos of plans not turning out how you had expected. The tough decision of repairing or trying to get by with locked commands. Doing the best with what you've got. All of which is fun.

However, I've only played it with two players so far, and with the standard rulex there is a runaway leader problem that makes for a very boring endgame, as one player easily wins while the other tries impotently to stop them. It isn't fun to be impotent. It isn't fun to trivially win. The game does improve with two players if the Capture the Treasure expansion is used though, as it alleviates the runaway leader problem through criss crossing paths.

Pirate Dice is the "little brother" of Robo Rally.

You throw up to 5 order-dice and choose at least one of them. The chosen die/dice is/are put in (one of) the four command-slots for your ship-orders. Then repeat throwing the unused dice until you have filled all four command-slots. 

A dice represents your pirate ship and shows the number of lives left (1-6). Now all players look at their first bell (= command-dice) and move their ships in the order the number on each die says. Some dice allow to shot a broadside. If you hit an opponent's ship it looses one live. If you loose your ship's last live you restart game with a new ship (starting with 5 lives). You win the game by reaching a special area (shown with a special die) as the first player.

PD is a very funny little game. You can play with 2-4 players (5 for kickstarters) and a game usually lasts 30 minutes (or less) so you can play several games or you can play PD as the "last" game of a gaming night.

PD has an advantage compared to Robo Rally. Two dice have special orders and with theese orders you can directly influence the other pirate ships. So even if a player seems to have an advantage he still can loose the game.

The idea I learned here was "it's RoboRally on the high seas with dice."  And so it is - set your moves with your dice, reveal, and find out what happens.  At the end of each round, fire your cannons!  But will you hit anything?  And can you get to the treasure first?

Very light, and matched with a short playtime means this is a great little family game.  Would work well with non-gamers as well.

RoboRally-ish chaos and mayhem with 2-4 players - just the count at which RoboRally tends to not have quite enough going on.

Like RoboRally, race-courses which double back on themselves are best, so that the leader has to weather passing back through all of their competition.

RATING: 5.5
Would give it a 5, though adding a half point with my teenagers enjoying it somewhat. But the "Advanced Game" for 4 players overstayed its welcome, and we all just wanted it to be over. (Games with an "Advanced" version should inspire and reward you to play it -- this one, instead, disincents me.) Very (blind-)luck-driven and too little control. Hands off the wheel (here, literally) too central a mechanism to the game, as is inevitable use of skulduggery on "whoever's winning." Uninteresting decisions. Lighthearted fun, and so a social game. For pirates, though, would always play the light Jamaica over this.

Wasn't too crazy about this.   It's basically a pirate version of Robo Rally.   But it isn't any shorter (assuming you are smart enough to play RR with 2 or 3 flags), and it isn't any better, so why wouldn't I just play Robo Rally instead?   The map boards are small and crowded, which means people are going to get shot a lot.   After players start getting eliminated, the game opens up a bit.   It seemed like an interesting idea, but in practice, it was just too frustrating and tedious, and it made me wish I was playing Robo Rally.

This 'killed' RoboRally for me.  The Dice rolling is infinitely faster than constantly shuffling the deck.

The only frustrating I would have is dropping the cargo.  There's little reason not to boat around the port and just wait for people to come buy, so you can steal their treasure.

Nem látom igazából létjogosultságát, mert annyira nagy roborally koppintás. Mit számít, hogy kártya helyett kocka adja a random faktort? Ráadásul szinte mindenben rosszabb, mint az eredeti. Kevesebb a konfrontáció, kisebb a káosz. Kevés a programozási hely, így gyakran mennek el teljes körök az egy helyen állással. A komponensek szépek, de a beltartalomhoz mennyiségéhez, illetve a játékélményhez  képest igencsak túl is van árazva.

The production was very nice, but the amount of variants was overwhelming.  It was good for a couple chuckles, but I really felt like I had little control over anything.  I'd rather just play something like Can't Stop if I wanted silly fun (that I could even control).

The dice results weren't really that different from roll to roll and nothing super exciting happened.

Robo Rally the dice game rethemed is this game.  Bits are beautiful.  I keep wanting to put my dice in the slots instead of on the board though - and slots are for dice that get locked due to damage.  Some rules confusion with tied numbers and how some of the special actions react but we house-ruled and of those questions.  There is a fair bit of dealing destruction in this game and the more players in a game the more likely conflict will occur.

Someone on BGG made a “Roborally Express game”, which translated the original into a fast-paced dice game This is that, only rethemed (in a way that I GUESS makes sense). I’d never played RRE but I love Roborally, so I was totally down for this. Like its grandfather, it’s a lot of stupid fun, and well designed to keep the game from bogging down as Roborally can. I like the additional tweaks, like the anchor and the rum barrel, and it really seems like a lot of thought was put into it. If you regularly bitch about randomness stay far away from it, but I thought it was a lot of fun. In fact, I ended up getting my own copy after playing it and have introduced it to others.

Roborally on the high seas. Probably will sink without trace.

Design innovation - 5 - A level of generosity as it contains some lapses in attention to detail. However, there is mess with opponents plans options which are fun and fit with the theme.

In my game I navigated the swastika shaped reef and got stuck in the whirlpool eyes.  I guess you don't get to do that everyday.

Cynical Marketing Innovation - 8 - Take a Richard Garfield design, make it shorter, add dice and paste on a pirates theme.  I believe this iteration does not move Roborally forward or bring new life to it.  The designers could have a future in the corporate world.

Gameplay - 5 - Roborally is a good game with an infuriating charm.  This is a shorter version with pirates but less charm.

How utterly disappointing. While the flavor of this game's inspiration, Robo Rally, is there, the unfortunate part is that the dice REALLY detract from your experience. While the cards in RR can screw you there are still a ton of board elements that help you make something of the lemons you've been handed. It just seems to me that in this game a bad roll is far worse than a bad hand.

The other negative for us was the take-that elements of denying a chosen action or forcing another to use yours. This makes it FAR too easy to mess with each other's plans and to make it worse it's hard to pull off your intended foil. You normally foil them doing something you didn't expect and then their altered movement will negatively effect you.

After an hour of going around in circles during our last game I think this one is a complete dud.

Simple and silly game where pirates roll dice, must keep 1 and may reroll others. Dice are ultimately placed onto a programming board that determines how they will move, , a la [gameid=18] or if they'll mess with another player's movements. After each simultaneous movement each ship shoots it's cannons. Ships can be rammed, sunk, etc. Due to some poor rolls, during my first game, my ship was stuck and just continuously rammed forward into a cay. First one to grab the treasure (and perhaps bring it back) wins.

RATING: 2
This may fill a void of being a lighter more accessible version of Robo Rally.  But though credit was giving to the original name of the game (even robot themed), no credit is given to the game that not only kind of inspired it, but is the origial game.  Even the priority numbers are similar ranges, and the lockdown only making sense for a robot version of the theme, not boat version.  This game looks like it was developed in minutes, changing card driven to dice driven.  While the original was certainly more inspired.  Doesn't this all make the game bad?  No.  But this game isn't simply influenced by another game, it's a blatant knock off that doesn't give the credit due that it should.

Having finally played, I'm alarmed at how great the similarities to RoboRally are.  That aside, the game itself is fast, fun, and rather more chaotic than Roborally.  In particular, there are two mess-with-your-opponent options which render all planning moot if they come up.

Dice-based version of Roborally, but not really any less fiddly or time consuming.  Roborally definitely has more variation due to the expansive cards and upgrades.  This will still get more plays before final judgement, but I think it is traveling "tenuous waters" in my collection.

It's a really fun concept and theme, but the logistics of the movement and the hidden dice rolling mechanic are a little clunky.

RATING: 5
Interesting improvement on programmed movement mechanic - dice in stead of cards and the ability to reroll for better choice options.  Played often via print and play version (titled "Roboderby Express") and supported Kickstarter Pirate-themed version.  Once arrived, I had expanded to other more complex and thematic games and this one never saw the play it deserved.

Not my genre; a grid-based racing game like Regatta but with multiple dice per person; roll your dice to see available actions. It took too long to be a filler but wasn't substantive enough to be a main course type of game. I'm not really a fan of Regatta either.

It's Roborally with dice instead of cards, and basically a race to the first flag (the advanced game has you return to the start base). You must lock in at least one die after each roll, and the re-rolls allow a good chance of constructing your program so that you'll be going where you like, especially as there's no time pressure. However, the map is so tight that you'll inevitably be bumping each other to places you don't expect, making it a recipe for unscripted results, which can be frustrating rather than fun when it happens turn after turn. In a slight change, lasers aka cannons only fire after the programs have fully run, but you only have 6 HPs instead of 9 so your dice can start getting locked in early than you expect. But you still have the Roborally rule of forgoing a turn (here it regains you 3 HP). I didn't really feel any pirate-y theme I must confess, and chaos for the sake of it doesn't go far. But I'm a fan of the Roborally conceit, so the game probably comes up a rating point more than it deserves. It's ok, but missable.

Players roll dice and set them in a specified order for their actions later in the turn. This is similar to programming the phases in RoboRally. The pirate ships are racing to grab a treasure and bring it back, getting in each other's way and shooting each other with cannons.

It's a command orders game similar to Robo Rally.  I liked how it had the same essence with simpler rules and quicker gameplay.  It was fun.

It was frustrating when the dice rolled and you couldn't get anything going, even after subsequent rerolls.  In RR, I could typically use at least a few cards.  Thus I liked the reroll option, however still can completely block your movements.

Overall, a lighter quicker of RR, however more luck based and I had more fun in RR (in games that don't drag).

It plays a bit more quickly than Roborally, but scratches the same itch.

Pirate Dice adds (surprise) dice to a RoboRally-esque programmed movement race game. In this case, each player captains a pirate ship headed for a treasure and at the end of each round, each ship fires starboard and port cannons. Some sides of the dice allow a player to screw up the plans of opponents. The best thing I can say about it is that it played quickly, and least on our 3-board map.

Fun and light tactical game based on Robo Derby Express. Played it with my 7-year old son. He understood the rules, but it took him a couple plays before he understood how to control his ship. Can't wait to try the advanced rupes/boards with my normal gaming group.

Increible este Kickstarter donde el movimiento de tu galeón viene dado por los designios de unos dados que contienen todas las posibles maniobras de los barcos y los disparos de sus cañones. Hay que tener visión espacial en este juego. Muy curioso ver como los jugadores tuercen sus cabezas para intentar averiguar para que lado torcerá su galeón aplicando determinados dados. Sistema de tablero modular que hace que repetir una partida sea casi imposible.

RATING: 2
Roborally without the fun.  Dry and tedious.  Poor theme integration.  The board has no hazards, and it's very hard to shoot at each other, so there is very little tension between the players.  In the basic game, there is a runaway leader.  In the advanced game, the first 3/4 of the game are irrelevant.  Very disappointing.

RATING: 5
This is a solid, fun, light filler.  It's easy to teach, and easy to play. It will be a great addition to the games our game group can play when we are waiting for another table to finish a longer game.

(Yes, it is Robo Rally as a quick game with dice instead of cards, and I think there's a definite place for that.)

Really fun, and I am not usually a huge Dice Rolling, Navigation player.  Sometimes in this game, you need to really believe that other players will be honest, but that is never a problem in our game group.  Everyone is rolling together, so you are always active in the game.  Certain variations of the game can run long, but it remains fun even when it runs long.

Kind of like RoboRally, but with dice and pirates instead of robots.  I love dice games, so that's a win in my book.  Quicker to play than RoboRally too, which is a big plus.

There is more player interaction than I thought there would be.  Lots of maps and variants should keep this game hitting the table for a long time.

Having never played RoboRally, I can't comment.  I can say that the rules are somewhat nebulous in areas still.  But my kids and I have fun playing it.  Is it top of the pile?  No, but it fills a niche for occasional play.

Imagine RoboRally on smaller, tighter boards, with a smaller variety of board elements to hose you.  Now replace the huge deck of uncooperative cards with uncooperative dice.  Instead of firing forward at the end of each phase, you only fire — broadsides — at the end of each entire turn.  Throw in a goodly number of variants, and you have a more family-friendly way to scratch that RoboRally itch; however, vindictive use of the skullduggery faces of the dice can lead to a little frustration.  If you take it in stride, though, it's all part of the crazy, dangerous fun!

A bit long for what it is for my liking. Like Twilight Struggle, if you play a lot and get to know the cards then it may make for a much better game but there isn't enough interest in it for me to do that

This is one of the few games my wife plays. Why does she play it? Because she loves politics and this title is just oozing theme. Every four years around elections time, this games hits the table with weekly regularity. 

Making of the President is also very educational, as it serves as a reminder how the electorial college operates.

I find the game gets better the more you play it. Learning the cards adds to the strategy.

RATING: 7.75
I think this a fun game, and I love how the mechanics represent the theme so well.  I love the narrative and tactical choices inherent in the cards.  The game has all the highs and lows (and luck) which I think must be present on the campaign trail, and because of that I find myself exhausted by the end of the game. 

At 4 plays so far, it is hard for me to determine good strategies to use amidst all the chaos and luck the cards introduce.  Sometimes I feel I have absolutely no control at all, but again I feel this really fits with the game's theme.

My husband and I are both enjoying this, but I can't rate it higher yet because we need to have a lot of energy, and the right mood, to bring this to the table.

RATING: 6
First off, I like Matthews' style of area control CDGs. I like the theme and I think the cards and actions largely reflect that. There are some things that I find unfortunate about the game. The debate phase is sort of a nuisance here as we almost always end up with 1 or 2 cards that are just sort of nuked, but using it as a "Space race/Tiananmen sq" type safety valve really spices it up as you aren't quite sure how it's going to play out. The bummer is that this requires both players have a similar mind set. Second, is there isn't really a reshuffle ala TS's Early/Mid/Late war system. If I get the right cards, I'm in like Flynn, but if I don't, there is only so much I can do about it. It's not like (as Nixon) I have to worry about Hostile Press Corps coming back to haunt me in a couple turns if I play it for points now and pre-empt it. Last, and particularly unfortunate given the second point is how the events fire off. It's bitter sweet in that it seems rather easy to maneuver around someone else's events so I don't have to worry about dealing with the consequences of them (especially if I chuck them on the debates), but this becomes much more of an issue before election day as you're more likely to pick cards for states more so than to dodge them and it's a more critical time for plays with time running out. If you're out of momentum markers, then it's open season for me, where as in TS I still have to deal with it but get to choose whether I get the points first or you get the event. That's a nuance to the general system that I find missing. On the other hand, I do like the system surrounding the momentum markers and the issue track, that's an interesting form of brinksmanship in terms of what sort of bait can you do to get your opponent to use their markers so you can sneak stuff in. One other thing in particular that I like is I find it's really easy and plays fairly fast (compared to his other games). The hovering around 0 and flipping things with endorsements is also a nice touch and makes election day worthwhile, but that sort of requires people play toward that strategy though...

I think there are two times when I'd play 1960 over Twilight Struggle; if I'm teaching someone new to Matthews' game style, and/or if I'm short on time. I find 1960 can be setup, played, and finished in 2 hours compared to the 3-5 for the other two games. Second, it's much easier to explain this as the influence placement and event firing are much more simplistic. It's certainly enjoyable, but all things equal and possible, it's probably not the first Matthews game I'd reach for.

update: 15+ plays in, I think it's a game where the meta-strategy and subtle nuance of CP usage in states is really a factor, more so than in either of it's bigger siblings. Will my opponent also chuck my stuff into the debates? Will I try and lock up stuff and dislodge them near the end? Will I compete on issues or do without much in the way of momentum to instead spend those cards in states? When you pick different strategies, the game sort of unravels a bit, but if people play in a similar fashion, it seems to really be a great nail biter in a smaller package. I almost want to talk about what I'm going to do before starting...  Still a 7, but maybe a 6 or an 8 at times depending who I'm playing against and how close it is going into election day (it's an 8 if I can ultimately win or lose based on how election day falls out by flipping, or failing to flip, a state through support checks).

update2: The GMT tweaks are welcomed, but ultimately the delicate meta of "split the Northeast and use card effects to efficiently snatch states elsewhere" only goes so far in my personal interest level. Docked to a solid 6 (and finally sold my copy to a friend whom I may borrow it from occasionally).

I'm all for the theme; the game is a bit dry. The debate round is odd, and while you must plan for it over the first 5 rounds it disrupts the flow of the game and isn't that interesting.

RATING: 8
The core mechanic of this game is the same as a variety of others like Twilight Struggle, "card driven war-games" is the descriptor. This one obviously isn't about war, its a political battle, but it still functions the same way as the more "war-like" ones.  I love the hell out of this basic game framework. This was one of the better ones, really capturing the feel of politics and being a lot of fun.

RATING: 3
I love Twilight Struggle.  I wanted to like this game, and I did after one play.  The subject matter is incredible and evocative.  But after the second play it became clear there wasn't much to it: play cards and move cubes around in a fairly superficial fashion.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A good "simple" Twilight Struggle, but I don't see much replayability here, most strategies focus on the East coast states, and the Debate Phase seem fiddly, insignificant and out of place (I know...I know...it CAN make a difference, but could have been abstracted in another way w/o "pulling" you out of the game board and losing the suspension of disbelief).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
I wouldn't call this a 'bad' game per se, but it doesn't tickle my fancy at all.  The events just seem too powerful which can lead to unlucky draws. I also didn't care for the drastic shifts that can happen anywhere at anytime. 
I wanted to like it and was disappointed when I didn't. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The idea behind the game and the mechanics are nice, but I think that they are far better in Twilight Struggle. The fact that even though you could be losing horribly you are forced to continue untill the end and the way the endorsement work make it a worst game for me (than TS which is one of the bests)

Playtested in late 2006... this one is going to be big. Features all of the tension of Twilight Struggle with a quicker play time. Need goofy plastic Nixon and Kennedy models for maximum effect. Z-Man will do well with this one. UPDATE: the finished product is amazing! This one is worth the effort... it plays quickly, you're always engaged, and the balance of skill and chance makes for a nail biting finish. The may become my favorite two player game.

[So close to my second 10.] The clearest rulebook I’ve read in a game, component-wise errata-free and heavily nuanced, this GMT Games version of 1960 is not only highly playable—it’s a snap to get underway and collectively, that’s why it almost earns a full mark. Fine out of the box, numerous avenues towards victory. If I were to improve it by way of a future “Deluxe +” version, I’d dump the State Seal tokens, mount the Debate Board and replace the Momentum counters with bespoke quality Poker chips. Easily playable solitaire, this game of course shines with two. This is a great remake and its subtle rules tightening works exceedingly well. Some bona fide solitaire rules would seal this second term.

2011-01-22 (rating 6):

I didn't like the game much. I don't like the card driven mechanics as it is far too random for me. Also the theme is not my thing in these game. Final counting is a nightmare. We had to do it twice and that changed the result!

Yet the game keeps tension in players (including the final counting) and seems full of historical details. Also I think that even thou it is random a better player still will win (at least statistically). So it has at least some advantages.

Very fine game and I really love the theme which is well integrated and wonderfully researched. I'm not sure why it's so highly praised, however. The mechanics are nifty, but it is in the end reduced to a tug of war, area control game. Replayability - yes, up until you've seen and understand all the cards. All of this might sound lukewarm, but it is considerably snappier than Twilight Struggle - but both have their nice features. It remains my medium weight 2-player game of choice (of which I could use a few more). And again the theme is really great.

Juego de 2 jugadores, Kennedy vs Nixon, muy parecido a su hermano mayor Twilight Struggle, pero con las suficientes diferencias para hacerlo imprescindible: menos azaroso y también dura bastante menos. Todo un juegazo de tira y afloja con motor de cartas y varias opciones estratégicas, de nuevo los autores se lucieron :) Y aquí a pesar de las cartas, no tienes la sensación de que te juegas momentos decisivos a 50% en un dado, vamos que hay azar por las cartas pero nada determinante en ningún momento y muy equilibrado, no como las sensaciones con su hermano mayor :P
La última edición española está decente, y corrigieron erratas. El mejor juego de la editorial a mi parecer.

THANK YOU SECRET SANTA 2009!

This is a great game, similar to Twilight Struggle. 1960 is a bit lighter, faster and more beginner friendly but still offers gaming hours dripping with theme. 

I love 'em both.

UPDATE March/2010:
9 -> 10
I constantly want to play this. The strategic and tactical depth of the game combined with an interesting theme has made this a classic.

UPDATE December/2010
10 -> 9
This is a great game but not as good as Twilight Struggle. And because I can't give TS an eleven, I'm afraid 1960 has to do with a nine.

I was looking forward to playing but it isn't as good as I hoped (i.e. compared to Twilight Struggle). The US election system is confusing, the events esoteric and the geography largely redundant.

Rating will likely change after repeated plays, but I get the sense that this will be a high 7s to mid 8s kind of game.  

It’s hard to not immediately try to compare this game with [i]Twilight Struggle[/i], at least mechanically, but there are key differences which makes this one a little less tense and agonizing in the decision space, and a little less susceptible to longer-term strategizing.  For example, players use about 88 cards in a game from a 97-card deck.  There are a couple events that allow you to discard cards and redraw replacements, but it is quite likely that you will never reshuffle the discard pile.  This means getting rid of an opponent’s card to the discard pile is much more safe than in [i]Twilight Struggle[/i] (there are a couple more events that allow a card to be pulled from discard, so not completely safe). The deck is also not split into an “Early Campaign,” “Mid-Campaign,” and “Late Campaign” decks, meaning you really can’t plan for certain events to appear at certain times in the game, nor are you guaranteed to see any particular event in any particular game.  This means sometimes debate events are drawn after the debates, and prevention events are drawn after all the events they are intended to prevent have already occurred. Additionally, the momentum mechanic limits your ability to trigger your events played by your opponent (but also allows you to preempt certain of your opponent’s events from occurring when you play them).  This mechanic actually results in some interesting decisions, as you may try to play a somewhat favorable event for your opponent early in a turn to tempt them to spend their momentum, just so you can dump devastating events later when they have no momentum to trigger them. 

This is much more approachable than [i]Twilight Struggle[/i], both in depth and the fact that the theme is less off-putting (to those that find the cold war theme off-putting).  Need to play more to assess depth.  Also might be nice to have a way to track a running tally of projected electoral votes as the game progresses.

Gioco che ho comprato attirato dalla tematica, di mio interesse. Si è rivelato un ottimo acquisto grazie alla capacità di essere immersivo, profondo e giocabile in 2 ore già dalla prima partita. 
Regolamento semplicissimo, card-driven asciutto con la simpatica trovata dei dibattiti e altre piccole "deviazioni sul tema" a rendere le maggioranze sul tabellone una lotta avvincente e costante. 

E poi.. 
come raccontare gli ultimi, frenetici, istanti dello spoglio finale??

A great game that is similar to Twilight Struggle but does a lot of different things, such as preparing for the debates and such are not only fun and intricate to the gameplay but also extremely thematic. On top of that, the game plays shorter by a significant margin compared to Twilight Struggle. 
In the end, when you win or lose, you do feel it is your fault and the theme comes out so much in the game that when the election is done, you feel like you have to address a crowd for either a Victory or Concession speech. Conclusion, easier to learn, quicker to play and thematically my preference over the cold war. Must say I do like 1960 better than Twilight Struggle and I already love that game a lot.

Update: I do not play this game very often. In fact, I may have played Twilight struggle more and now I think that  TS is a better game. In any case, my chances of playing either one of them often are slim.  

Twilight struggle was a bit a dissapointment for me. I initially liked 1960 better. It is shorter and more accesible. My biggest complaint: the number of votes per state should be much more visible.

Juego interesante y divertido. Muy dependiente de las cartas que te toquen para decidir la estrategia a seguir.

RATING: 7
1st play: I spent the first part of the game constantly comparing to ways it didn't line up with Twilight Struggle.  By the time we were finished, I really appreciated the game for it's own sake.  It doesn't have quite the narrative arc that TS does, but it plays in about half of the time, and the simplifications don't really remove the strategy.  I really like the idea of support checks instead of dice rolls, although the dice roll makes for more exciting moments.  Similar to Twilight Struggle, after playing this game I'm eager to play again, and I like reading about the cards to learn about events from this era of our history.  Top things learned: California was Nixon's home state, the south is predominantly Democrat, and Vermont and New Hampshire were Republican.  Something about Oregon and Washington being Red states took some getting used to also!

2nd play: Played again on the last day of the year! Excellent game and we corrected a few minor rules mistakes from the first play.  Not quite as good as Twilight Struggle, but still really good.  The theme is timely and gives a real sense for just how close presidential races can be.  The cardplay makes more sense when we properly prepare for debates, and the end game checks were tense.  Wish this one weren't so expensive to pick up, it's worth owning alongside Twilight Struggle.

It's a great game. Our second CDG, after Hannibal: Rome vs Carthage. I cannot speak of 1960, without referring to H:RvC.
Similitudes: both are CDG, you battle for influence in areas, somewhat different starting positions (especially Hannibal).
Differences: theme (d'oh!), the fact that the opponent can trigger an event from a card that you played as CP (excellent mechanism!), much simpler and clearer rules, short duration (our first game lasted only 2 hours!), not too many strategies to choose from.

A politically-themed game in which two players take the roles of Nixon and Kennedy in the 1960 campaign.

Things I like:  Relatively short play time (vs others of the genre), interesting cards & historical aspect, angst of what to do with your opponents cards that you have drawn.
Things I dont like:  Potential for issues dominance & back and forth nature of the issues.  Rest cubes dont seem to do nearly enough to justify it.  Game seems to be largely determined by who draws more powerful cards, and who draws their opponents power cards in the final two turns when they can be buried without consequence.

Excellent game with exceptionally smooth game play, fantastic mechanics, and well-developed thematic elements. The theme is presented in actual news articles, which drive event abilities - so if you want, you can learn about what happened in 1960 via flavor text. The rule book is better than average, although it could be better organized. The only reason for a slightly lower rating on my part is that details of American elections are a passing curiosity for me at best, so it doesn't hold my interest from a thematic perspective.

Good game. Dramatic to the end. The game has a significant random factor, but that is essential to the theme, it isn't much of a negative mark on the game itself. The game is essentially thematic; I think that's the value of it. Where I'm at right now, I like the idea of less random factors, but that doesn't prevent me from appreciating this game and having fun playing it with others.

Preliminary:  It certainly isn't Twilight Struggle and doesn't have quite as many moving parts or factors to consider.  It simplifies the mechanisms a bit, but not entirely in a good way.  I like worrying about DefCon, and about the numerous auto-win scenarios, and the scoring cards.  Loses a bit of theme from it also.  But I can see it playing faster, and the cube bag is a good way to handle randomness.

RATING: 7
At the time of writing, Twilight Struggle is one of three games I rate a 10.  1960 was almost bound to suffer by comparison.  The single campaign deck that lasts most of the game without a reshuffle takes away the deck management of Twilight Struggle.  Decision making seems a lot more straightforward too.  Nixon is strong in the West, Kennedy in the South, so a lot of the contest is fought over a few key states in the East and the Mid-West.  Luck of the draw can have a powerful influence in Twilight Struggle and in 1960 it feels even stronger.  

Thematically the game is very nice, with period photos, snippets of flavour text and good artwork. The rest/momentum system is a very clever innovation.  As others have commented, the absence of a running score leaves players to either wing it and hope for the best or spend ages counting.  More clearly visible state values would have been good too.   1960 is merely good where Twilight Struggle was great.  It's main advantage over its older cousin is a much shorter playing time.

While I'm still mad at JFK for making hats passé, this game keeps getting better and better for me.  I've played it with my wife, she enjoyed it.  Mike and I played it just before Barak got elected right in the heat of the campaign during the "Say it ain't so Joe!" Palin vs Biden VP debate. 

Hand management combined with area control combined with staring anxiously at the political capital cup, wondering how much you have left to burn. Throw it all at New York and hope your dad paid enough for Illinois. Then get back on the Lockheed Jetstar, down a scotch mist, and get your strategy together for firming-up Texas. 

I'd probably rate it a ten if I could manage to win here and there! It is that good. Educational too!  

And at least once per game I try to pick up that dang pencil.

RATING: 6.5
Great theme and overall nicely designed game. However this game - which is clearly derived from [GAMEID=12333] - lacks something. Since there is one - too large - deck of cards anything could happen. So there is little anticipation on events to come.

Well I didn't dislike it, but the possession of some happy cards could gain the day. On the other hand I didn't find this a great strategy game either. Why the nice mechanism of gaining states - abbreviated in a circle - in the last round only goes for the last round? Now you run around the USofA placing cubes as if it is all that absolute.

The way momentum works is nice.

RATING: 7
Nice 2-player game. Nice components. I do like card driven war (?) games. It really captures the atmosphere of the era but truth be told I find Twilight Struggle better as a game. It's meatier and has more tension. I miss the scoring cards that make Twilight Struggle an exciting game. Still 1960 is a nice game on its own quicker and easier to play.

RATING: 7
A very good 2p game. Ultimately the game comes down to clever hand management of the cards, and deciding how to use the cards etc. for your best advantage. In that way, the political theme matches the gameplay. I don't like the way that mechanisms that feel like they should be more important (e.g. the debates) aren't, it's counter-intuitive, and it's also very hard, without more experience, to know what the best strategies and moves might be, so it's all a bit of a shot in the dark until the final count. Definitely worth exploring further.
...
This is a game that, as I suspected does repay repeated plays. My plays tend to be spread too far apart, and I am very aware my thoughts above would probably change with more experience. Probably debates are more important than I thought. However, as I now prefer Twilight Struggle, this won't get much play, except when there isn't time for TS or someone else wants to play this.

Slightly disappointed despite the relatively high rating. I really believed I was going to consider this game brilliant, but in this case it seems I'm the victim of over-expectation. Although I enjoy playing I think the problem is the occasional feeling of a lack of worthwhile progress due to either poor cards or opponents simply reversing each other's plays. It is not quite as engaging as I had hoped.
On another note, the components are generally great although the finish on the board is easily scuffed.

I first played 2008: Campaign Manager and then Founding Fathers, so was very much looking forward to this one.

The game is considerably heavier than either game mentioned, but this is mostly due to having to keep track of such a bigger board and in the many more options you are presented with each turn.  The base mechanics are very simple to understand however (card driven, play a card for it's event or for it's CP) and all of the options interact with each other very well; allowing players to cleverly manipulate various aspects of the board state (mostly in how players gain control of each state).

Overall I really like this game.  But there are a few issues it suffers from.  One comes in terms of components in that there really needs to be a bit more cubes (perhaps 10 more for each player) to help prevent shortages.  Another comes from how certain aspects feel a bit too lucky, this can come from card draw (where it can really hurt you to not have enough cards to both save for the debates/ election and in draws where all of your events only seem to benefit your opponent) and in various 'checks' where random cube draws dictate whether actions are successful and who goes first.

Despite these issues however, 1960 excels at so many levels.  It is both very flavorful and well integrated in its theme, it's components are all very functional with one another (if the cubes are a bit lacking), and it's mechanics are easy to follow and allow for a number of different avenues for victory.

I've had this and twilight struggle for a while, but hadn't been able to get them to the table - they are two player games that take a significant time sink to play. Well, I finally had a game day where people had to bail until it was only me and one other player, and I decided to bring this one. Wow, this game is tense and full of theme. I was Nixon, he was Kennedy and we vied for control of the east and the midwest and it just felt like a true battle. The choices were meaningful (do I play this for ops...uh oh Kennedy benefits big time on this *gulp*). I mean, I don't think there was a turn where either of us were on autopilot. I went into the debates feeling like this was going to be a close contest, then was CLEAN SWEPT on all three issues, and suddenly Kennedy had everything but the west locked up. I can't wait to either get this to the table again (Nixon shall riiiiiiiise again!), or get Twilight Struggle to the table. Holding off on an official rating though because I've only played once, but tentatively I give this a 9.

The best election game that I know.

It plays fast, it's well balanced, and easy to explain and play.

Unlike Twilight Struggle, where the history aspect really creates an atmosphere, in here it doesn't help much for it is too much of a specific moment in history, American history. So, it's kind of hard for me and my brazilian gaming group to relate to the facts and people.
But the use of midia, relevant issues, endorsements, debates, etc. really create the atmosphere of an electoral duel.

It's also a great game to introduce hard core eurogamers to card-driven "wargames". They start with 1960, then migrate up to Twilight Struggle, and, when they least expect, they are happily playing Paths of Glory and Hannibal...

Wow! What a game! Possibly the most exciting two player game I have played (well actually that may be Space Hulk but that's a different kettle of fish). However, this was one tense and fun experience. It felt down to the wire and there were small victories and crushing defeats throughout. 
The agony of having to play cards that benefit the opponent make each "simple" turn really taxing. 
Every little bit works so well together and you surely do not have the time or resource to do everything you need to do.

2nd play was just a exciting as the first. There were crushing turnarounds, stand up moments, yells, pacing, icy glares, grumpy huffs and whoops of joy. This is one cracking good game.

I am bursting with excitement after playing.

3rd game and once again I was beaten soundly. (two loses as Nixon, one as Kennedy)

Finally WON one! - Still a fantastic and tense battle of wits which had stand up moments, agony, elation, pacing, tears, whoops and all that makes a game great!

This game is a roller-coaster of emotions. I get so worked up when playing. It frustrates me beyond belief, I end up losing it almost every time at the final hurdle yet still I keep coming back as it plays so smoothly and remains engaging.

very tough cookie to rate.  needs more plays, and i'm sure i'll get them.  initiative is a big deal, i'm not sure that rest cubes are enough compensation for excessive 2 draws, the cards are thematically awesome, i like the event/momentum system, media doesn't seem worth it to select as a turn choice but is a nice bonus when gained via events, i ultimately like the debate system although tiebreaking is monstrous, endorsements probably affect the game more than i would hope, a running score would be very useful and seems almost necessary for competitive play, components and rulebook are both very good although i wish there were more cubes and more prominent state values displayed.  overall i think i dig it, but i'm still kinda concerned about the variance in 2-draws, initiative, and endorsements.  i walk away from it thinking that twilight struggle is perhaps a "better" game, but i'd rather actually play this one.  i need to revisit TS to confirm that though.  i think both games are well worth exploring.

Vaya por delante que el tema, para mí, es una NO rotundo. Sin  embargo siempre está bien escuchar a los demás... y las críticas eran TAN buenas!!!
El juego es fenomenal. Recrea la campaña por la presidencia entre Nixon y Kennedy.

La partida está dividida en 4 espacios temporales: la campaña electoral, un debate televisivo, el sprint final de la campaña y el resultado electoral. 
Los turnos constan de tres fases (a grandes rasgos): robar cartas, jugarlas y una última fase donde dependiendo de la política del candidato se reparten beneficios en forma de apoyos electorales o de impulsos (que no dejan de ser esfuerzos del candidato por ocultar sus debilidades o hacerse con políticas jugadas por el oponente). 

Las cartas se gastan de dos maneras:
- como puntos para ser gastados en mítines (que consiguen hacer retroceder el apoyo electoral al rival o hacer avanzar al tuyo en el mapa de EEUU) o también para enfatizar el tipo de política (derechos civiles, defensa o economía). 
- O como el texto que trae cada carta, que será pro Kennedy, pro Nixon, o a favor de los dos. Todos los textos son sucesos que ocurrieron durante la campaña y siempre salen todas las cartas en cada partida.

Despues del turno 5, llega el Gran Debate televisivo, una fase que tiene su enjundia y que aunque no me parece excelentemente bien resuelta (al menos por ahora) le da una pausa y un aroma a la partida que me chifla.

Le siguen dos turnos más, que son el sprint de campaña, con alguna regla especial chiquitilla, y por último el resultado de las generales, con un recuento de votos de mucha tensión, donde el número que se perigue es ¿267?. (creo que sí).
Pedazo de juego para dos, terriblemente inmersivo, de reglas fáciles, difícil de controlar pero que jugado con calma es estupendo. Duración cortuca-media y con un tempo y una sensación de baile de salón, donde todo fluye, donde todo está relacionado y la lógica lo domina todo... Un aroma excelente... (Salvo cuando en los dos últimos turnos, una vez acabado el debate televisivo, se roba alguna carta que apoya ese debate, y que a mí juicio, me saca completamente de esa fluidez)

Es un placer jugar al jueguito. Me recuerda muchísimo al Twilight Struggle aunque no sé por qué, éste de las elecciones me gusta más. Todo será jugar más al TS!

Often though of as "Twi-LITE Struggle", 1960 is a pleasant introduction to card-driven games.  It's simple enough to serve up to an enthusiastic newbie, but has enough meat to satisfy a more experienced gamer. 

My games have always been pretty close with the more experienced player coming out on top in nearly every contest.

It doesn't quite have the tension and depth of TS, but there's plenty there to keep you interested.

Very nice game. Huge board - for a two player game. The cards really add depth and atmosphere to the game, you can play cards as events (mirroring events that happened or events that could have happened) or you can play cards for campaign points which can be used in several ways, but if you do this you allow the other player to trigger the event if it's advantageous for him.
It is a must for 2p who want more than light 2p games.

RATING: 9
Szerintem zseniális a játék, bizonyos elemeiben még a Twilight Struggle-t is felülmúlja. Azt hittem, sokkal jobban hasonlít egymásra a két játék, ehhez képest csak néhány főbb mechanizmus a közös. Nemcsak a téma alapvetően más, hanem a lehetséges akciók is nagyon eltérőek. Ami szerintem jobb, mint a TS-ben, hogy itt az események kiváltása az ellenfél részéről nem automatikus, hanem fizetni kell érte. Tetszik az is, hogy fix körös a játék, a történelemtől ez esetben legfeljebb a végeredményben térünk el, bár a TS-ben meg épp az tetszik, hogy sok féle vége lehet. Mindkettőnek megvannak a maga előnyei. Jó ötlet még a zsák, és a bábu mozgatása is. Lehet vitatkozni a szerencse mértékén, szerintem a zsákos megoldás jobb, mint a kocka. A 6. forduló-beli vita szerepe kicsit túlértékeltnek tűnik így elsőre. A játék 2/3-ában főként a vitára készülünk, ehhez képest a díjazás annyi, amennyit akármelyik kártyával is megkaphatunk. Sokkal fontosabb ennél, hogy melyik 4 államban javíthatunk a választás napján. A lendület jelzők szerepe helyenként fontos, de sokszor nem tudtam őket mire használni, mert nem volt értelmes esemény. Egy megjegyzés az esélyekről: elsőre Nixon kicsit erősebbnek tűnik, ami azért meglepő, mert a valóságban Kennedy nyert. A TS-ben jobban el vannak találva a valóságos viszonyok, hiszen az Usa ott a vége felé kezdi kapni a jobb kártyákat, az 50-es években még a szovjetek az erősebbek.

Ha már végig a TS-hez hasonlítottam, akkor az összegzésnél is így teszek: az 1960 jóval könnyedebb, kisebb lélegzetvételű, számomra átláthatóbb, kiszámíthatóan 2-3 órás játékidővel (szemben a TS kb. 1-4 órájával), és szerintem főleg a témán múlik, hogy ki melyikkel ül le játszani. Nem gondoltam, hogy a TS után még ennyi újat fogok látni egy hasonló gyökerű játéktól.

Ja, a kártyák (a többi kártyavezérelt játékhoz hasonlóan) nagyon jól néznek ki. És sajnos nyelvfüggőek.
---
Továbbra is zseniális...
---
Egy fontos adalék még, szintén a TS-hez viszonyítva: míg a TS-ben egy kártya nagy eséllyel többször is játékba kerülhet, de nagy esély van arra is, hogy fele nem kerül játékba (ha előbb vége van), itt elég pontosan ki van számolva, hogy pont akkor fogy el a pakli, amikor vége a játéknak +- 1-2 lap. Tehát kb. 99%-os valószínűséggel egy lap pontosan egyszer kerül játékba.

RATING: 10
A játék fogadtatása részemről elég vegyes volt. Nem voltam oda a témáért, de ez egy játékot követően teljesen megváltozott. Azóta sok mindennek utána néztem - már ezért megérte kipróbálnom...
Számomra nagyon sok újdonságot tartalmaz mechanizmusaiban.
Tetszik, hogy vmi azonnali jóról mindig le kell mondani egy jövőbeni remélt még jobb érdekében. 
Sok mindent szem előtt kell tartani, és figyelni kell a másik játékos terveire is. Ötletes a vitaesemény, és a választás napja is.
Egyelőre nem is ismerek más olyan játékot, amely az első lap kijátszásától olyan feszültség alatt képes tartani, mint ez...
A játék közben néha sírni tudnék, néha az öröm vetne szét - iszonyat érzelmeket képes a felszínre hozni!
Azt hiszem ezt is magammal vinném egy lakatlan szigetre, hogy legyen mivel játszani Péntekkel.

Azonban a szerencse mértéke - mely képes a szavazatszámokat jelentősen megváltoztatni - jelentősnek mondható,... de, hát ez mégis csak egy kártyajáték és ilyen maga az élet! Egyszer lent, egyszer fent...!
Nem volt még olyan partim, hogy ha a játék egyik fordulójában "elvett volna vmit", azt később "ne adta volna vissza"...

Fantasztikus!
Számomra vitathatatlanul a Nr.1!!! (2014-ben ez már csak a múlt... időközben a Netrunner "beelőzött")

The atmosphere is really good.  The spanish version looks great, and the game is enterteining.  It is not too difficult, but takes some time.  But I think it is quite luck dependent, and there is not a possible strategy, since there is a lot of hidden information.
Counting the votes during the game is nearly impossible, so it is difficult to know how the game goes.
Anyway, I enjoyed it, and would play, but I don't think it is sooo good.

Love the theme. This game is like twilight struggle. Actual historical event cards tie in very good with the theme. My complaint from these two games, is that all these events are used to interact with some number on a territory on the map. I wish for a wider scope. Still a very nice game, and actually I think it is the best political game I've played.

It's definitely a lighter and simpler version of Twilight Struggle, and I would always play TS instead of this, but it has its own merits. Too bad the GF doesn't want to play any of them...
After a few plays I must convene 1960 needs the "Dunnagan variant" to break the ebb and flow of issue positioning.

many things to like, but some to hold me back as well. seems you have to fight all the important battles, you can't just give up on something and fight elsewhere.  a LOT of what changes on the board is random event-based, your strategy choices seems often relatively less important. also, the game I've played the card split was just ridiculously advantageous to Kennedy, I've won with almost 400 votes, I'm sure I wouldn't be able to enjoy the game too much had I been on the receiving end.

Well, this improves on a bunch of the aspects I dislike from Twilight Struggle. The static scoring allows for more long-term strategic board play as opposed to more tactical scoring. The limited number of opposing event activations means that you can plan your turn out a bit easier and also means that the game is less reliant on pure card memorization. Even though the advertised time of 90 minutes is correct, it might still play a bit too long for what it is. My wife, though, hated her plays of it (she's not played Twilight Struggle). If she didn't have such a distaste for it, I'd rate it a bit higher.

RATING: 5.5
I found the support check mechanism to be an interesting alternative to dice rolling (although not necessarily better) since you can manipulate the number of your color of cubes that get added every turn thus improving your odds of success. However, the rest of the game kind of fell flat, especially the very loose movement rules, uninteresting debate mechanics, and largely deterministic battles for state support. The game mechanics make sense within the theme, but it didn't make for a very interesting game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Appreciate: the management of playing / not playing events at the right time combined with the steep price to pay in order to prevent the opponent from playing an event; the use of the political capital bag for balancing odds.

Don't appreciate: the game mechanics are limited to adding and removing cubes from the board with very little else to do; gain of debate round seems meager (4+3+2 cubes at best) compared to the effort put in; the little use of having initiative during normal turns given the comparatively large number of rest cubes "lost".

Really good 2 player game with lots of competitiveness. Sure it has a random factor and I suspect some games it can shift the scale a bit on the heavy side, on the other hand that is politics. It had a very good atmosphere surrounding the elections. Some minor details were a bit unclear but it didn't take away from the game. I expect it to be even better next play.

(2 Players, 120 min) The first election of the modern media era. An Ivy League Democrat versus a working-class Republican. With the rise of the Soviet Union and civil rights in the American South threatening to reshape party ideologies, who would come out on top in this landmark contest? A game of campaign planning and shrewd decision-making as you struggle to get 270 electoral votes before the game ends.

Played with severe reservations after it has been heavily compared to Twilight Stuggle (which I hated and traded promptly). After one play I understand the comparison but this is everything Twilight Struggle should have been, with balanced control and relatively little randomness.

What little luck there is can be influenced and not a die in sight.

Well researched topics for cards and an ability to strike out to surprise your opponant. Plays easily in 2.5 hours even from a cold start.

Looking forward to next game.

There is a little luck with the cards and the cube draw from the bag, but there are plenty of good decisions to make to create your own luck. Just like in elections, you hope your actions will yield positive results only to find that your opponents counter move was twice as good as yours. The theme is perfectly captured and I found it to be very interesting. I also learned a few things about history which I never mind. The comparisons to Twilight Struggle are obvious in the card play, but this game has several unique features, designs and art that separate this one from it's brother. The rules seemed less complex and the game more accessible to non-war gamers.

Played through 4 turns to learn what the system was all about with my Aunt over Christmas.  Interesting, fast, and once we had hit the 4th turn LOTS about the game became clear and if we were to do it again, things would have been different.  Have not played the final scoring nor the debates, so have no idea how overall game play effects those events. Time will tell.  Though, I am really excited to give it another go soon.

Was originally put off by the theme since it's not something I'm that interested in. But I really like this game. I tend to like games where you have a variety of cards and you have to figure out the best way to use them. I also like games where you have to keep track of multiple things at the same time.

The components are quite good which is nice.

After two plays.  There is a lot to like about this game (theme, mechanics, and component quality).  However, I didn't really feel that the card play is all that nuanced as it did not compel me to do deep thinking.  UPDATE: I had to mark this one down after a few more plays.  It is a repetitive zero-sum, tit-for-tat area control game that goes long on theme but short in actual gameplay.  Becomes dull quickly.

*Not nearly as good as Twilight Struggle, but good enough. Maybe if I had played this one before Twilight, I would have different opinion. This is a great game still, one of the best so far, but for now I give it a solid 7 for 2 main reasons:
1) Game is heavily language dependent, so it is hard for me to find partners to play the game with.
2) I cannot not to think about Twilight Struggle when playing it.

Still, one of the best 2 player games out there. Great buy anyway.

You know this game is good when every decision is difficult.  The order which you play your cards is important as well as what you give away to your opponent by playing them. The only frustrating thing about the game is some cards are just better than others. I would remove the 7 cube placement cards from the game. When a player is able to spam these cards the game is just over.

RATING: 4
Beautiful game and clearly a lot of work went into the theme (which justifies my rating) but it is too much luck driven and I was bored out of my skull while playing this.
Truly an awful experience and I wouldn't recommend it.

Oh... and the rulebook is the worst rulebook ever. It's fairly well structured but there are so many sub-sub-sections that at the end of it you're going to say "I don't see how this game flows".

I think I played my fair share of complex games and went through horrible rulebooks (Race for the galaxy, Arkham Horror,...) but this one takes the cake. Never Have I had to read three to four times the same booklet.
Maybe I'm "the making of the president" challenged, I don't know.

Oh... and the "debate" phase is unnecessary complexity added to the game that really doesn't add anything... except unnecessary complexity (like this sentence).

Craptastic.

NOTE: before this game my policy was "I keep all my games". The keyword here is "was". SOLD IT.

1960 The Making of a President is one of those games that I would like always carefully select to buy and own. When I buy games I go by the following criteria

1) Gameplay feel
- First I always look at the game and feel would this be interesting, is winning this game a challenge, is it interesting and involving how would it feel to play this game and would there be any problems game play wise...

2) Replayability
- This one for me is huge.  Cause games for me could be good but maybe the replayability just aint there. Maybe you have that feel have seen it all and the path to "victory" or entire fee of the game would feel to samey.... 

3) Ease of Play
- Is the game clunky. Not just in the sense of is it a gateway game...no in general is it a chore going through the turn, is it too lengthy, is it too hard to explain it to people without them studying it themselves, are there any doesnt make sense parts in it and so on. If game flows great and makes sense.... Ease of play is there and that is a huge plus when introducing game to any new player.

4) Artistic feel
- Let's kid not...the game needs to have that looks great on the table aspect...well I mean it always helps. 

5) Thematic ties
- To really feel involved to play the game and feel immersed this is essential... must have almost for me.


This game?

Gameplay feel is definitely an 8. 
Replayability is probably a 7
Ease of play probably an 8,5
Artistic feel for me personally an 8 
Thematic tie is a 9,5

Which for me makes it  solid 8 score game. I was expecting an interesting game, studied it a lot before buying it, but it still "pleasantly surprised me" and I am urging to play it again soon it is the replayability which is probably the lowest because of the 2 player nature and just two possible roles, same starting positions and what not. But still many elements gets mixed and strategy is adapted and changes based on them a bit. so I do feel it has a fair amount of that as well. So like I said will gladly play it again. A great game and one I am glad to have in my collection

Neat political game. Needs to be played with the variant where you cannot place issue position CP's on the issue marked on the card - only on the two other issues.

Played this four times now and won each time. Definitely a good game, but now that I also own Twilight Struggle I'm not sure that this will get many more plays. Twilight Struggle is very similar and quite simply better. 1960 is easier to learn though, so maybe you can consider it a "gateway" into TS.

My favorite card driven two player game. Its an amazing game.  I like setting up the game next to my computer so that I can maintain a current tally of electoral votes.  The tally can be maintained with a file you can get from BGG.

I played my second game and it was fantastic.  The flow of this game is amazing.  The randomness of who is going to win the election perfectly simulates the tensions a presidential candidate must feel the night of an election.  I highly recommend this game as it is an absolute winner.  

I played my third game and because of the brillance of this game I have completely re-adjust my user ratings for my entire game collection based on the aim plus quality of this game.  

What a great gaming experience. One of the best I have ever played in. What a great story line.

Components are very good, much better than Twilight Struggle, but not as good as I'd hoped, based on the comments here on BGG.  Some state markers delaminated slightly when I punched them out.  Most markers have tabs from their die cuts.  The board is a bit warped, and the cardboard is obviously not as heavy as it could be.

A recent session of this game was one of the best sessions with any for quite some time. That was the second time I tried.

[Got it as a Christmas present.]
First game took over 4 hours (with a slow opponent, but still....). I liked it. It's been a while since I've played Twilight Struggle, but I think I like TS better. I need to think about it a bit more and maybe play again before I write up my analysis. Second game still took over 3 hours, with instructions for a new opponent. I'm really enjoying this game, though. Lots to think about, lots to keep track of. Unlike TS, you know exactly how many turns you have left (no Grassy Knoll card to immediately end the game). That takes away some of the tension that TS has, but there's still plenty to worry about! [Third game--with another new opponent, but one who's played TS, was just over 2 hours.]
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Theme fits influence point mechanism even better for this than it does for "Twilight Struggle".  A little more chaotic than TS, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.

Edit: docking it a point.  Fun per play falls off a bit after the first few.

RATING: 6
I liked Twilight Struggle but was too tense for me -- I play games to relax! -- and most of that game was in giving your opponent great benefits and trying to survive them, which can be frustrating.  1960 still has this but much lessened, and that easily makes it the better game in my eyes.  More focused, not overwhelming you with choices but still giving you lots to mull over.  This is a deservedly great game.

Took four hours, though, and we only wasted minimal time checking the rulebook.  We could probably at best shave an hour off this.  At least TS has the potential for ending early.  In fairness I must say I don't see a way they could have decreased the playtime substantially.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
My first play.  The game really moved along quickly.  You really get the feel of the ebb and flow of the election...and the events really gave the time frame some shape.  I enjoy history, especially 20th century, and this game was enjoyable.  

Thinking about it more, I haven't wanted to play this once since that time.  The major reason is it really lacked excitement and an edge that TS has.  The game doesn't balance on the tip of a pin like TS does and that kills it for me.

RATING: 8
Quite possibly the best game I've played in the last year.  There is nothing I can complain about with this game, except for the inherent frustration of a back-and-forth, knock down election struggle.  For every brilliant maneuver you make to surge ahead in the polls, your opponent will retaliate with an equally vicious play to knock you back down a notch.  Great, great fun.  Games easily coming in under 2 hours is a bonus.

After several more plays, my opinion of this is slightly less.  It's good, but it's not GREAT.  There are a few things that bother me - the debates seem really arbitrary, media influence seems all but useless, and positioning on the issues is very hit-and-miss.  It's also frustrating how easy it is for your opponent to just go around reversing all of your moves.  There are so many "add support" events that carrying a state has no real benefit.  Overall, still a good game but not quite as good as it could be.

A recreation of perhaps the closest Presidential election in U.S. history, 1960' is an excellent introduction to the card-driven boardgames (Twilight Struggle) and wargames (Hannibal) that are becoming increasingly popular. Z-Man has given the game a lot of thematic flavor of the era with its graphics for the map and cards and the game itself can be finished in about 90 minutes between experienced players. Compared to other games with similar mechanics, this is a fraction of normal playing times by anywhere from a half to a quarter or even less. My first game clocked in at just two hours and came down to the Late Returns from Cook County and the Recount cards! (Kennedy won. I played Nixon.)

This is a very nice game. The components are fantastic and it recreates the campaign race quite well. More often than not it comes to the final round. And it's all over within 1 or 1.5 hours! Downsides are the Issue War Strategy between experienced player, which kinda ruins the game. In the end, I prefer Twilight Struggle, but this one gets played quite often if time's limited.

I don't know why this game intrigued me less than Twilight Struggle because it's similar in some aspects and has less luck elements.

Similar to Twilight Struggle.  There are a few aspects about TS that makes it more appealing to me.  The scoring cards that can come out at any time make TS a little more interesting.

Overall not a bad game and thoroughly enjoyable, but in the shadow of TS i have to rate it a bit lower.  If you like the theme of this game you will definitely have fun.

Bought on the strength of Twilight Struggle. Finally managed to get a play of this and although it's basically similar to TS, the concepts are easier. It's simple to play this game knowing TS already. 

The lack of knowledge of US history is not that much of a handicap, but like all games of this type, knowing the cards would be something of an advantage!

first play - 11/14/07 w/Nevin.  Nevin played as Kennedy and took an early in the south and out west with california... I controlled the powerful northeast states and midwest states... Nevin played well in the end timing events and cp useage to take back NY and PA (NY on the very last phase / turn) and he won 281 - 256.  We both really enjoyed the game on the first play through and can see trying it again soon!

Oh-man-oh-man!  Nixon pummeled my skinny Kennedy in a landslide defeat (at 3AM, roughly by the clock,) and I was desperate to play again for a rematch!  Top-notch production, tricky Dick, savory heartache at what to do with some of those great events. . . this was a knockout for me.  I'll play it more and see what time does to its standing; if the game has the legs over repeat plays, I suspect this will stay at the top of my ratings list.  

One quibble at this early stage: the influence of the Debates over eventual Election Day results is questionable.  Understandably, every small fluctuation during the course of the game will--in aggregate--contribute to the final tally, but I wonder how vital the Debates outcome really is.

Enjoyable and filled with interesting decisions from beginning to end.  The games are usually so close that you won't really know who wins until the very end.  When you're on the losing end of a close game you will kick yourself for decisions you made way earlier in the game.  Like many CDG games this one can suffer from a runaway leader if a beginner is playing someone who really know the cards, but for two players on equal footing this will be a battle to the end.

FWIW, this is probably one of the heaviest games I've gotten my wife to play that she has actually enjoyed

Excellent game.  This game was designed by the same designers that put together Twilight Struggle.  

It is well published with high grade components and nice to look at.  

It is much easier than TS as far as plays as cards, which are played for events much much more often.  This game is fun as it progresses us threw an US election and lets us ride the rollercoaster we in the US are all familiar with.  It is a great learning experience but due to the speed of play I absorb less of the historical data actually on the cards than maybe I could from reading a good book about Nixon etc.

I am really torn on this one.  On one hand, this has to be one of the best games in terms of historical flavor and implementation of theme.  On the other hand, the gameplay is just the tired old mechanic of area influence/cube placement limited to a few areas of importance.

Rating of 7.5 is based on one play in person and two plays via VASSAL.  Better in person, but still worth it on VASSAL.  Hope to play this again soon.  

My third play really bummed me out -- I lost all but two of the initiative draws.  And the two I won were the debate round and the election day, which didn't mean much.  So my opponent was able to go second in every important round, and he took full advantage.  I don't know how often this ridiculous kind of initiative happens in a game, but it really sucked the fun out for me.  (And yes, I could have handled it better in the game, and I probably will the next time, since I am a bit better prepared for it.)

I love TS but not his. What gives?

First, I don't find the theme all that engaging. Playing TS, I can see an alternate history unfolding before me. But this? I'm just not as familiar with the 1960 election as I am with the broader cold war.

Second, there's too much chrome. I enjoy the influence game on the main board but found the debates, issues, endoresements, and media control sub-sytems to be a needless distraction. 

Finally, I didn't find the rulebook all that clear and was constantly having to go back to the rulebook. With TS, I was up to speed quite quickly.

Nope... didn't care for it. Quite a disappointment...

Both historical and playable, providing balanced play throughout with event card options seemingly evenly spread with influence and power for both players, reminding me in this respect of Hannibal: Rome versus Carthage. Also has the Hannibal feel to it with the card play centering around regions/states containing the highest electoral votes, (like the red/blue control counters in Hannibal). Rules are very clearly presented and seemingly easy to teach. I like how the debate turn provides a short break toward the end, and allows for a turn of events if the candidate played cards prudently the previous turns leading up to the debate. Good tactical play with the event cards is necessary, and should ultimately decide who will prevail in the final election turn. Neat mechanic includes the option to play on your opponent's card during his turn - and the ability to sometimes stop this if attempted.

Reminiscent of Twilight Struggle. Slightly simpler but still fun. Perhaps less luck than TS since 1960 has no dice. Very good for a political voting game which normally would not interest me as a theme for boardgames.

In our one game, it seemed that New York state was the big battleground as that accounted for a 90 vote swing.

PS we ran out of red cubes.

After only one play, it's difficult not to compare 1960 to Twilight Struggle, but is it fair? In any case, this one should see less table time than TS, at least so long as we don't burn out on TS.

This is a very good 2 player game, similar in so many ways to Twilight Struggle.  This game certainly is shorter than TS, but the way the cards work with actions and CP is almost identical.   I do like this game better than TS I think, since it appears that no single card is TOO powerful.  It seemed to me in TS that some of the later events were game-ending.  Note for the future:  make sure to get endorsements!  Letting the other player get all the endorsements makes for a very rough end.

After having played it six times, I've generally found this game to be relatively engaging. The CDG mechanism is adapted nicely to the less war-like theme, and the "rest cube" bag mitigates the effects of bad card draws nicely.

My one critique is that it is simply too easy to travel all over the map and undo what your opponent has done. As a result, it has far more of a tit-for-tat feel than the gradual build of Twilight Struggle (which is, in my opinion, a better game).

Currently my favorite CDG. I grokked it fairly quick and played it online a lot before buying a physical copy. I like the theme, know the cards, and 96% of the rules fit on 1 page. Unfortunately, it's hard to bring to the table. It plays fast, I find I can play ten turns of this in two hours but 1989: Dawn of Freedom & Twilight Struggle take twice as long, barring any quick early game blowouts. Component-wise, the game is solid and the board is well designed.

Some negatives include theme and the Issues track. A common complaint is, the prevailing strategy of CP usage on the Issues track leads to repetition and boring play. I recognize that this can happen, I've gone issue heavy in many games myself, and the Issues are important but I don't think it breaks the game. Campaigning and using your cards well can balance out a lack of cubes in the Issues. Unfortunately, the theme is harder to overcome. If you don't find the most, well possibly the most, contentious American election in modern times interesting then this theme is not for you.

I'm a fan of the theme. All the cards work the election into their CP value and event. The art and photos on the cards are from the election as well. This is the 3rd game that Mr. Matthews designed that successfully melds theme and rules onto the cards.

Excellent. Does a fantastic job of putting you in the center of the campaign and making it feel exciting and authentic.

Really looking forward to a second play.

A well balanced alternative to Twilight Struggle. I like the AT elements of Twilight Struggle more than the Euro elements in this one - way more tension and pazzazz.  You have fewer, less interesting uses for operation points in 1960, and the debates are pretty underwhelming.  TS doesn't take that much longer, either.  Good stuff, and well produced, but it never got played with TS around.

RATING: 4.5
As a great admirer of Twilight Struggle, I couldn't get into this as much, maybe because I don't know a lot about the 1960 election.  But while I thought every card and event in TS was dripping with theme and historical import, in 1960 I found myself ignoring the text and pictures on the cards and just trying to push cubes around. We fought for so long over New York that it started to get boring (three cubes out, three cubes in, four cubes out, two cubes in, blah blah...). 

I lost miserably, partially because I ignored the political issues track and the media support/endorsements (I wasn't really sure what those did anyway). Maybe repeated plays will help my strategy and I'll like this more, but I don't think I'll be requesting this one again any time soon.

Enjoyed my game and would like to play again.  A much better game than Twilight Struggle, and one that benefits from knowing the deck.  It works well, but there are definite luck issues present, both in the amount of CP one gets, as well as the end of the game whammy.  The potential for an entire game ruined by luck is there, which makes me hesitant to give it any higher than a 7.

The number of people I know who will play this game is exponentially higher than the number who will play Twilight Struggle thanks to the vast difference in complexity.

This is an excellent game, but I really, really wish it took less time. Our first game took 2.5 hours; given AP, I don't see this getting below 1.5. Still, more accessible (and thematically more interesting, to me) than Twilight Struggle. UPDATE: 7 --> 8. Still too long, but our second game was terrifically tense. I was literally sweating by the end. I also got crushed. Talk about interaction: there are so many ways to affect the other person here that the game can get quite vicious.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
While you're inevitably reminded of Twilight Struggle (two player 'political' CDG covering a similar era) 1960 is sufficiently different in play that the superficial resemblance fades as you get into the game.  

I would say that it's a little less complex than TS (though perhaps someone playing this first then TS may feel the opposite) - it's certainly less footery (the cubes are much easier to handle than TS's chits, and there's not as much of them as the areas are not multi-occupancy) and the systems feel a bit more rounded, and possibly better integrated - the debate and final surge are nice touches, while the advertising/opinion battle offer a respectful nod to the grandaddy of political game Die Macher without being at all beholden to it.  At the moment I would say it's a slightly better game but I suspect that more plays of TS in particular could convince me otherwise - that element of unexplored depths is a major attraction of both games (though I suspect that TS is deeper as well as more complex - the two don't always go together).

Recommended - even if, like me, you've no idea where you were when JFK was shot (though in my cot is a good guess).

RATING: 5
UPDATE: I've taken my rating down ... 1960 just seems kind of, well, boring. Play some cubes, pick up some cubes, look for the good events ... there just is not that much excitement in the game. A lot of it I blame on the fact that advertising and issue support seem too weak, rarely worth investing in, and without those two dimensions the game is almost completely 1-dimensional and uninteresting. Maybe I'm jaded. It's OK, maybe systemically a little stronger than Twilight Struggle (although too many things are still out of whack), but TS has a more entertaining theme (although both themes are a bit of a paste-up). Not terrible, I might play it again, but not ultimately a keeper. Of the two of Z-Man's recent endeavors, Duel in the Dark is much more interesting.

Several usability foul-ups mar an otherwise attractive game. Also, there are definitely worries about play balance.
---
UPDATE: There are definitely bits of this game that make me uneasy. The cards do not seem well-balanced; the events are usually significantly more powerful than the CPs, to it's not usually much of decision whether to take the CPs or take the event, you just take the event if you qualify for it, which is a little weak. Advertising seems little weak. The Momentum chits are hit-and-miss, you seem to get more of them than you get opportunity to use them. The Support Check rules seem superflous since they don't apply to cubes placed as events. And it seems like a little bit too much of the strategy will involve knowing the deck, and what the event composition means in terms of the viability and importance of campaigning in various theatres (South, Northeast, etc).

I think it'll be a fun game for a while, probably moreso than Twilight Struggle just because of the length and because it's somewhat less one-dimensional. But I fear this will lack replayability for the same reasons TS did (large luck elements, opacity of the draw deck making the game needlessly difficult to learn for new players, and systemic imbalance).
---
Initial impressions are reasonably positive. Struggles with a few of the same issues Twilight Struggle had (some powerful neutral events are very swingy, even in such a straightforward game there are still elements that should have been removed), but the additional dimensions of endorsements, media, and issues seems to help quite a bit. Not totally sold yet, I definitely have some uneasiness about some significant things (play balance, balance between the game elements, luck level), but there is the possibility that this has managed to grasp what eluded Twilight Struggle. At the very least, the playtime and pacing are both much better.
---
Some graphic design issues with this game: while it's very attractive, what is the single most important piece of information in the game? How much a state is worth, point-wise. So why is that in tiny type? Come on guys, this is not rocket science.

The "little brother" of Twilight Struggle, this is a good game in its own right.

While much friendlier than it's older sibling, this one maintains all of the flavor of Twilight Struggle that I love so much.  I really like the addition of momentum, as well as the way randomness as handled in this game vs. Twilight Struggle.  I also thought the additional use of cards for the debates as well as the final election swings was pretty clever.  All-in-all, just as great as its big brother but more digestible and a shorter playtime with a few neat twists on the system.

Updated 6/17/10.

Finally decided to sell this one after not playing it for something close to five months.  My general thoughts follow.

My wife and I went through several evolutions of strategy in learning 1960.  Early games focused on cube trading in large states.  Shortly thereafter, we discovered the strength of advertising and issue positioning, which changes the dynamic of the endgame a bit.  By the end, we had learned enough the cards to understand which of the smaller states were in play at which times, and then spent a good deal of energy on the issues to force or preclude those events.  

Although it was interesting to proceed through this development, the final stage is a bit of a rough one to stomach.  With more momentum markers in play, hand management becomes a bit excruciating.  Which events do you preclude?  Which do you play early to hope your opponent will burn through markers?  Which do you just bury in the debate pile?  I know, it sounds like it should be fun (and I usually like tough choices), but it's actually a bit exhausting to spend so much time thinking about how to avoid the bad things, rather than simply focusing on the positive.  

Other big concerns that ultimately led to the sale: (1) The game is at least one turn too long, and I usually end up sacrificing atmosphere (reading the cards and "experiencing" the events within an alternate-reality 1960) to save a little time.  (2) The fact that the game is a set length leads to a little too much back-and-forth time biding, as compared to Twilight Struggle which is always at risk of ending (and is more a game of momentum overall).  (3) I still don't understand the strategy behind the debates.  I'm starting to think I'm just hopeless on that side of things.  

Originally, I thought this would be one of my favorite games.  But repeated play didn't bear that out.  It felt too unsettling, too long, and too boring to really captivate me.  If someone invited me to play, I'd probably happily agree.  But it wasn't something that saw play often enough to justify its space on my shelf.

Excellent components. A good game, but sometimes runs a little long. Made me look up several of the historical events that appear in this game, which is always a good sign. 

Still, low play count, as I just don't get the opportunity to play it all that much. Most of my 2-player time is spent playing Wargames, and that's rare enough.

Just got this. Actually my first "political" board game. After playing twilight struggle and learning more about the cuban missle crisis this game really got me interested in JFK. I like the game but I have got to figure out a better strategy for media/advertising/political control debate track. It kills me!

RATING: 8
[17/12/2007] I've now played more than 30 games. That alone indicates my regard for the new gold standard of political games.

That said, I feel the game's not perfect. Among experienced players, the early and mid-game tends to degenerate into an overly intense tug of war over the issues at the expense of other means of spending your resources. The Dunnagan variant solves that issue, in my opinion. With that variant, I'd happily give the game a 9.5.  

Why not even then an outright 10? Well, the bar I set for an outright 10 is exceedingly high. My view is that some of the card events aren't as attractive as I'd like them to be. But it's not a huge issue for me. Just one which puts the game half a point short of perfection (if including the Dunnagan variant).

----

Update 2014: I think I need to dock the game a few points. The game as published simply has a severe issue with the issues. But I still like it a great deal and it's really one-of-a-kind.

Got this for our anniversary.  Heather took me to the game store before going to the restaurant.  This should be a really good 2 player for us to get our teeth in to.

Played first game with Tommy.  (8/14/09).  This was a lot of fun and could easily hit the table again if he and I have a spare night without the wives, as well as maybe even getting Heatehr to try it out at least once.  

The history behind the game definitely adds to the fun of the game.  A little luck and a lot of skill to win this game.  Wonderful.

RATING: 4
It feels long. I suspect it's because we spent so much time fighting over New York, making the game feel repetitive. And if I'm going to play a long game, I want it to feel epic, not repetitive.

The second biggest flaw would be that two rest cubes doesn't balance out two extra campaign points (or a better event). We discovered that because I drew mostly fours and threes, while my opponent drew mostly twos and threes, and I walked away with the presidency. Those extra CPs meant I had momentum the entire game while my opponent never did, which let me use more events, which let me have a huge advantage.

Now, I'm sure that card distribution doesn't happen every game, but it really had my opponent slogging through nine rounds of an unwinnable game. It felt more like Bush vs. Dukakis than Nixon vs. Kennedy.

On the plus side, it certainly gave me an idea of why the electoral system in the US is so messed up. I mean, we only cared about big ticket states, content to pick up other ones as incidentals. So, if you weren't worth at least ten, we completely ignored you. Under twenty, and we were content to leave the leads established early until the end of the game, fighting only over states worth more than twenty.

RATING: 4
Complex tug of war.

Very average, very boring.  A tarted up Euro with a basically tacked-on theme. It has huge, massive amounts of luck with some extra luck thrown in.  There are some mechanics that balance the luck but really it's just: play a card, place some cubes repeat.  Too much tug-of-war. 

The BGG hype machine was really running on this one, but it's way over-rated. I was slightly, but only slightly, less disappointed with TS. Euro-cum-wargame card-management cube-pushing area-controllers are not for me.

Plays like a streamlined version of Twilight Struggle. I'm really impressed with the playtime, specifically. It lasts a good hour and a half but turns feel short and snappy, making the overall pacing perfect. 

I really like how players are forced to sacrifice good cards for debates/elections, and I love the political capitol bag mechanic - this marries strategy and luck in a sexy way. I'm not sure why they didn't include enough cubes, however. 

The flavor text and images on the cards evoke the unique theme well. Definitely a winner in theme department!

Would like to play this one more and see how it holds up long term.

Shows how difficult it is to campaign across the nation with so many choices to make, but with not enough time or resources, just like reality.

The components are beautiful, the theme rocks, and the game is just plain fun. I think the card draws are pretty important, but managing bad hands is half the fun. And the length is perfect. Awesome. 

I think twilight struggle is a deeper game, but as someone who will never get tons of plays of either, I like 1960 a little more since it requires less knowledge of the cards, I like this theme more, and it plays a full 90 minutes shorter - which considering the massive amount of luck in these games feels more appropriate.

[u]October 2008:[/u] The more I think about it, the more I wonder about its replayability. It seems to me that the games will tend to have too much the same feeling and for the moment (be it because I won each time by a landslide or because of a real thing), the game isn't that tense and I didn't really feel challenged. The game is pleasant, but maybe 90 minutes (and 2 hours for me and my gf as she is slow) is too much for a "pleasant game".

I think I'll make at least another game with Laurène and try to make another with one other of my friends and see if I still like the game.

[u]May 2009:[/u]
Still haven't played to it since october 2008 and I'm still not really interested... I might yet keep it as the theme really interesses non-boardgaming people (yes, weirdos) and that might draw them to come and play... Not really sure though...

I actually lowered my rating from 6.5 to 6.
If I had to decompose my rating, I'd say: 
theme: 10
gameplay: 7
replayability: 4 (After 2 plays, I don't want to play anymore!)
luck factor: 7 (card driven but cards are mostly balanced except maybe one or two)
personal feeling: 3 I don't know why, it just doesn't click and I can't really say why.

RATING: 7.5
I tried this after Twilight Struggle and now prefer this. I rarely play 2p, but when I do, I would rather play this than TS as it’s much easier and faster to play. While the way you play cards for events or cubes is reminiscent of the gameplay of TS (and is something I’m fond of), and you do control some areas, the way you score points makes the game quite different: you play 8 rounds and tally up your points, and I think I prefer this to the VP track of TS. Also, there isn’t really any connection between the states in 1960 as opposed to the countries in TS, which has a big impact on the strategy.

Speaking of strategy and of winning the game, it does suck a little that NY/PA/CA have such a huge impact on who is winning. I’ve won all of my games, but if the balance had tipped in one of those states, the outcome would have been different in two of them. Yes, I know, it’s thematic, and you also fight a lot for those states as they are so important compared to e.g. Hawaii and the states in the West, but that just feels… odd. I don’t want to spend so much time fighting back and forth about a few key states! I know, if none of the players fight over them in the beginning, the game can open up a little, but it will always end with players trying to get control over those states, at least that has happened in my games. They just seem too important.

The issues is a good other way to spend your cubes, and while the endorsements and president markers are good, I don’t feel like they are overpowered at all as it’s not too hard to prevent the endorsements from getting your opponents a lot of points. I like that you can use your own markers for either following events or blocking your opponents from following events. The debate is a good idea and it can change the outcome of the game somewhat, though in the worst-case scenario you won’t lose too many cubes as you should be able to win at least one of the debates. Personally I feel like it’s better during the game to dump some very strong event cards (which your opponents could use) in the debate and then go for just winning one of the debates, but maybe that’s just me. I just know it’s worked every time so far with both candidates. 

It’s clever that you can control a state if you have 4 cubes in it so your opponent needs to make checks unless they control the media in that region. However, these checks feel a little random… And it sucks so much to lose 2-1 when drawing the starting player each round as you will almost always be chosen to go first which is almost always a disadvantage. Yes, of course, your opponent does lose some cubes from the bag, but still. Also, it’s quite random at the end when you don’t know in which four states your opponents make check… This sucks quite a lot, especially because the bag can run out of cubes and then it’s just tough luck (I know about the refill). 

But, anyway, I like the game a lot. I love that you’re forces to play cards which your opponent can follow (though you can prevent it if you have a couple of markers yourself), and it always feels like you’re fighting an uphill battle! It only takes a couple of hours to play, so while it isn’t as deep as Twilight Struggle, I’m going to play 1960 more.

RATING: 3
Horrible luckfest. For two of the nine? turns I had literally NO cards that I could play that would not benefit my opponent more than me, and in two others I had one card worth playing. "Oh, that's so unusual, the game doesn't normally play like that" gets tiresome after the second time. I will NEVER play this again unless there is some way to draft the cards; as written, I feel it CAN BE (not necessarily in every game) broken

I was five years old during this election, so I don't remember any of it.  However, when Nixon finally won the presidency years later, many of these things surfaced again.  I enjoy it - not as much as Twilight Struggle - and would welcome a play any time there are two of us.

RATING: 8
A most excellent game.  This is all about playing the right cards at the right time, and in the correct order.  Everything else is just a bonus.  The fact that you can take advantage of a card played by your opponent makes the momentum aspect of the game very important.  There is the potential that the "Issues" portion of the game can be a little overpowering, but I think that only works against you if you decide to ignore that part of the game - at your detriment.  Expect to lose if you ignore the issues.

Overall, an excellent game, and one that I will try to get to the table as often as possible.

(Never happened - traded it away, as my wife wouldn't play, and I rarely have an opportunity to play a two-player game with anyone other than her or someone that would want to play it.  So it is gone due to "lack of exposure", although if someone asked me to play today, I would play it).

After I first played it, 1960 instantly became one of my favorite games.  I love the theme, and this game executes it perfectly.  The game is a bit complex, and some might be turned off by that, but if you can get all of the rules down, this is a blast.  It reminds me a bit of El Grande (area control, 9 rounds), but with a fun and exciting twist.

This deserves a reprint!

I really like the theme, and the game gives you lots of options, which I like. Two points that I do not like:

1. Lots of setup - you have to find an place all state markers. I have been wondering if I can just skip this step.

2. Knowledge of cards can influence play - someone who is more familiar with the cards has a big advantage.

It's fun, but not without it's faults. Still - it is well executed and makes you think.

All the Awesome of Twilight Struggle but a little better.  The Coup/Re-Alignment Roles/Space Race of TS are thankfully gone and instead we have Endorsements/Advertising/Political Issues which I think are better ways to spend OPs.  I also think the candidate cards > the china card.  Add in a subtle rest- cube/political-bag counter-balance to the big OP cards and this one comes out on top.

The most disappointing game I have ever played. I don't understand how common opinion places this as the 11th best game of all time (on 2/3/08). Noone I know likes this game. It looks superficially like it will be a great game but in the end the events swing it too much. If you draw well, you do well; if you draw poorly, you do poorly. There's no feeling of control. You don't feel like you are duelling wits against your opponent for the hearts and minds of the American public. You feel like you are dumping wooden cubes on a board based on the numbers a card tells you to. I love the concept but the game feels like it could have done with a couple more years of development to make something tense and exciting.

I enjoy 1960, but I have two problems with it.  The first is that it is hard, without spending a ton of time counting and keeping records, to figure out where you stand vis-a-vis your oppeonent.  The second is that, unlike it's "brother" Twilght Struggle, there is only one scoring phase.  This adds to the first problem, and also bothers some of the people who play with me, who feel like the last two turns are much more significant than the previous ones.

RATING: 8
Interesting parallels with Twilight struggle but substantially different to provide a new experience. My knock on 1960 is the responsive nature of the game. How many time do you place issue cubes, and then they place issue cubes. Still a much better time frame than TS and an epic count up at the end.

Played this game for the first time and enjoyed it. The game felt like no other game I have played. The only thing I see that may flaw it is that there is only 91 cards and you use at least 88 per game. As such I think this may hurt the replaying of the game as one gets to know the cards. Other games with more cards alow you to replay as you will not get the same cards. All in all though it is a must have game.

Overall Score 8, Appearence 10, Components 9, The Box (storage) 6, Rulebook 9, Ease of Play 8, Mechanics 8, Involvment 10, Replayability 7, Uniqueness 10, Luck 4 v Strategy 6 (The higher the number the more it leans that way.)

After one play, I liked it. I feel like you really need to embrace the chaos. But once you do, it is very enjoyable. What shocked me the most is how it really felt like an election. Anything could happen. One moment you're on offense, thinking you've got all the cards. Then all of a sudden the whole game has turned. One interesting thing about the cards is that you can play without knowing the cards and have a lot of fun. That is not the case with a lot of card driven games. Of course, not knowing the cards, you are liable to get thumped by someone who does. The only reason why this is a 8 and not an 9 after one play is the time it took. Definitely not the 1 1/2 hours on the box. Took more like 3. Super pretty package, great gameplay. Could go up to a 9 with more plays.

Update without even playing again: I'm not sure why I originally gave this an 8. I just haven't had the desire to play again. It just felt a touch too chaotic. Yes, like a real election, but not a particularly fun game. Maybe it'll go up if I do end up playing again.

La verdad es que este juego me ha sorprendido gratamente, pensaba que el desarrollo de la partida iba a ser más farragoso, es verdad que durante el primer turno puedes ir un poco más lento hasta hacerte con la mecánica pero luego fluye sin darte cuenta. Como ya os he comentado me gusta más que el Twilight Struggle porque está más pulido y dura la mitad. Y la sensación que te deja el juego una vez terminado es muy placentera. Para jugarlo dos personas con tiempo por delante es una opción muy considerable. Esta claro que no es para jugarlos todos los días, hay que reposarlo y luego volverlo a retomar.

[UPDATE 1/16]: So I note that I have this ranked higher than Twilight Struggle, which seems like something worth justifying, because it's a pretty serious minority opinion. I am inclined to tip my cap to Twilight Struggle as a better designed and maybe more strategically interesting game-qua-game, so this is an instance of my personal tilt being a tiebreaker. 1960's theme is closer to my heart, of course, but even more so I think that the theme is better integrated with the mechanics of 1960 than TS. The gaminess of TS (which is at the heart of what makes TS a good game) does take me out of the feeling of re-creating history that a good historical wargame (or what[i]ever[/i]) should have. 1960 is also quicker and more accessible while still keeping a comparable level of exciting cut and thrust in the card play.

:sugar: :( :D Talk about your epic struggles between good and evil; I've played games in the role of the Soviet Union, al-Qaeda, Nazi Germany, and the Cali Cartel but never have I felt guiltier than when I looked my father in the eye and told him that I was replaying the 1960 election in the role of Richard Nixon. Such are the travails of life as a third-generation Irish-American yellow-dog Democrat.

Anyhoo.

1960, while not in the rarefied air of the most sublime card-driven games, is still a lot of fun to play and represents a nice distillation of the form into a game that smart people who are not well-versed in gaming will pick up with relative ease, not to mention a game that plays at a reasonable length of time for a weeknight. One problem with it, like most CDGs in which the cards are never (or almost never) reshuffled, is that the order in which the cards are dealt has a powerful effect on how easy or difficult the game is for one player or another. (A card that lets you fish the card of your choice out of the discard is inconsequential in your first hand, and massively powerful in the last third of the game, frex.) Twilight Struggle deals with this nicely by dividing the game into three mini-decks, two of which will see pretty much every card come out in a semi-predictable order.

In 1960, every card will be used (in some way) once and a few (but only a very few) will come out twice, so someone can do well and someone can be screwed by the luch of the draw.

And issue control is overpowered and media is underpowered. (Would that real life elections were this way.)

And there's a lot of zero-sum see-saws over key states and issues. 

And the support check mechanism, while cool, is underutilized and doesn't function as well as a catch-up as one might hope.

And all of these things are serious issues. But I have a lot of fun playing it, I love the theme, it's well produced and (at least before it went OOP) affordable, and once you learn it, you can play in 90 minutes.

RATING: 7.1
This game is a card driven game a la Twilight Struggle with the 1960 Presidential Election as a theme.  While Twilight Struggle is closer to a wargame CDG, 1960 is more of a Euro CDG.  The game was co-designed with Jason Matthews and he brought over some ideas from Twilight Struggle (such as opponent events being playable during your turn).  After one play, this game is lots of fun, plays quickly, and doesn't seem to require the brain-melting analysis that Twilight Struggle sometimes demands.  An interesting theme with interesting mechanics.

A very good politicial simulator. The best I have found. The rules are nice and easy to pick up and the game looks colourful. About two hours is right for the game. Not sure that I would play this too often but currently I wouldn't turn a game down.

Fun game.  Similar appearance to its cousin, Twilight Struggle, but different gameplay.  It's a little hard to know where you stand in the game (unless you can calculate states in your head or have a computer handy).  The break up of the debates and the elections help the game move along and feel like you have mini-goals throughout.

It's not quite as deeply satisfying as its cousin Twilight Struggle, but it still affords much pleasure even with its simpler, quicker presentation and experience. Call it a gateway drug to TS and 1989 if you'd like, but one that holds up very well on its own merit even after you've sampled the more substantial designs.

Simple, yet engaging card-driven game. You can play it without knowing the deck, but you need to know it to play it well and to mitigate the copious amounts of luck involved in the card draw. Both the debate and elections mechanism are quite well put together. A lovely game, where luck enhances the theme rather than distracts from it. Very nice.

RATING: 6
Fun game with straightforward rules, extremely well-themed and very nice components. I'm a big fan of Twilight Struggle, so its nice to see more political 2-player contests with similar mechanics coming out.Only going through the deck "about" once takes away some of the fun deck management see in TS, but its just a different game. I'll have to play more times to get a better sense of things, but at this point I prefer TS by at least 1 rating point. It seems there may be a "winning strategy" by focusing on the issues and trying to generate a momentum advantage. 

This game is not growing on me with repeated plays. I love the theme...and would like continue to see more new games in the genre (Twilight Struggle, etc), but this one just seems to be too luck sensitive. Anyway, it just feels like there is something about the game that turns me off...and detracts from the decision-making.

The person who wins initiative and forces the opponent to go 1st will usually be able to dominate the issues. 

Twilight Struggle has more of a learning curve, with the events and knowledge of the idiosyncracies of the board as well as card combinations...which ultimately makes it a much more satisfying game than 1960. Still, with how short 1960 is, I'd play it most any time someone requested it.

RATING: 8
This game blew my mind. Just awesome. Granted, I am a political junkie so I love the theme. Still, the mechanics are just great, and the whole game just felt so tight. This rating is based on one play but honestly I can't see how I could lower my rating ever.

*update* after more plays, it is still a great design with lots of tension and just a great game overall. 

*update 2*
Issues control seems too important and too easy to monopolize. Candidate movement is annoyingly implemented. Still a great game though.

RATING: 6
I could not get my head around playing Nixon I could not even associate myself with the events on the cards.  I kept seeing what was good for JFK must be good full stop.  I missed opportunities simply because of my broken game radar, I been playing WW2 games for years and so I should be used to playing the role of an organisation/person I have no empathy with!  I kept on trying to play cards like I was JFK. 

I had two or three good turns at the beginning of this game and my opponents presence in the game almost vanished.  I've never seen anything like in a top end strategy game.  I then felt like I was going through a mincer for the rest of the game, bad decisions (I really didn't play well) and my opponents got a few breaks the situation turned around slowly.  

On the last ordinary turm I lost most of the highest value cities (New York etc.) and the opponents cards on the last turn scuppered my fight back completely.  I should of lost but I held most of the low scoring states and Texas and that was enough.  I played badly and lost most of the battles I was focused on and still won.  I think that Twilight Struggle gets accused of being a onesided luckfest but this can take the biscuit.  

I will in no doubt get my head around being Nixon and will play better next time (I really hate playing a game badly win or lose) but my opponent was robbed.  Those first two turns set me up for the rest of the game, my bad play and indifferent luck was not enough to change the outcome.

This is a Twilight like game that can be played in less than 3.5 hours (thematically bang on which as an ex wargammer matters a lot) and that is as far as I'm concerned game set and match.

2014
I have a suspicion that good play and victory in this game can be a tad disconnected.  I played badly and won the first game and hoped that this was a fluke. The second game produced the same kind of one sided colapse as the first game.  I felt powerless as the loosing player to change the outcome.

A game that takes over 2 hours to play and is this luck driven does not rock my world.  I will be revisiting this game at some point and hope I'm wrong.

2015 - 1989, Twilight Struggle  and Wir sind das Volk! all float my boat more.  Its the singer not the song.

Remove the heavy theme/mechanic integration, rich tactical and strategic gameplay, and sheer design brilliance from TWILIGHT STRUGGLE and you're left with 1960: THE MAKING OF A PRESIDENT.  It's really a shame, because the theme and concept are staggeringly great and the overall feel of the game is very cool.  However, whereas TWILIGHT STRUGGLE was a sometimes subtle, sometimes brutal tug-of-war game 1960 turns out to be another appease-the-BGG-masses exercise in cube adjustment.  For all the excellent use of period photography and artwork, most of the cards simply adjust where cubes are between the board, the rest area, and supply.  Sorry, but to boil the really interesting issues and situations of the 1960 election to pushing cubes around doesn't make for an interesting game at all.  In sum, 1960 feels strangely abstract and the opacity of long-term objectives (unless you've memorized every state's electoral votes) coupled with the fact that you can play beautifully and then completely lose in the last three turns of the game make for a dull and unfortunately disengaging experience.  Of course, the BGG mindset holds that more abstraction is better, so I guess that explains why many are saying that it's "better" than TWILIGHT STRUGGLE.  It's not a total disaster- the theme, as it is, remains fascinating and it's a little more accessible (read: less wargamey) than TWILIGHT STRUGGLE. It's also shorter overall so it avoids being both long and boring.

Read the rules and did a test run playing both sides and while I liked it, I still have yet to play with another live opponent. I was surprised by the huge game board so you'll need a large table. Like others have mentioned, my wooden cubes had some white residue on them, but cleaning them with some water and alchohol was an easy fix. All other component were in good condition.

RATING: 8
Sometimes in board gaming, you gotta give a game few tries before ultimately judging it. Such was the case with 1960, a game I initially disliked but finally have grown to like after finally completing a full game. Granted, 1960 is a long, somewhat convoluted 2-player game that simulates the Kennedy vs Nixon 1960 presidential election. But the game is very strategic and has numerous elements that weave together well. I have not played Twilight Struggle, but the fans of Twilight Struggle I have spoken also seem to like 1960.

RATING: 7
A good follow up to Twilight Struggle. The topic is just great! Who would have thought to make a board game based on that election? The production value is wonderful, much better than the treatment TS got with GMT Games. One small issue that I have though and that has been brought up in the forums is that there are not enough cubes in the game and you can run out. Z-Man should have included more cubes, so that this would not be a problem.

It is a lot lighter than TS, but that is fine, as it helps it to play quicker. I like the idea of drawing cubes out of the bag to determine things like initiative and being to control how the cubes go into the bag based on the cards you play. The lower the CP value of the card the more you can seed the bag with your color cubes and thus shift the odds more into your favor. 

In the end I do prefer TS to this though, as I find TS to be a much richer experience and I prefer the cold war topic a little more to the election one. Still this is an excellent game and I am happy it is on my game shelf.

Not nearly as good as 1989 or Twilight Struggle. Four reasons: 1. you only go through the deck once (which removes the "play your event or save it to use as ops" decision in the other games) 2. Little strategic benefit to controlling states due to the ease with which the opponent can drop cubes anywhere on the map, 3. Too much tug and pull on the issues track, and 4. I miss the tension created by the regional scoring cards.

The more I play games with 'battle cards', the more I realise I'm not cut out for them. They're usually too weak on actual game, and too swingy in how they play out. 1960 is no exception: The incessant back-and-forth over states becomes grating after a far too short while; and because of the game's zero sum-nature it really becomes a matter of deciding how to deal with the Big League states first, and then how to hurt the outlook of the opponent as cheaply as possible (using media and/or endorsements, the latter via Issues) in all the little ones. (That is not to say that well-timed media pushes are without their use in the Big League states: they can be hellishly annoying, in fact.) This is simply the effect of efficiency of actions (which are obviously limited): in Big League states this efficiency is way higher than in Backwater Hick states. And because this strategy will ultimately be the same for every game, matters will soon turn to how the events fall. Which is, at best, a semi-random process. I just find it not fun, even annoying, to play my cards in a specific order to maximise on their potential in one game turn, only to have that effort being nearly completely undone in the next (replacing it with a slightly altered game state) through no fault of my own. Why not just roll a D6 and be done with it in a fraction of the time?

These games work far better as simulations of their chosen topic rather than as actual games, I find. As such they serve well as primers which I may or may not delve further into. 1960 is really of limited interest to me: it's not part of [i]my[/i] history. And that quells further exploration of both topic and game, such as there is.

I like the variety of choices a player has, and that you can't move forward without evening the playing field first.  But I have started to notice that luck in card draws plays a bigger role than it should.  Bad luck can put one player hopelessly behind.

In general this is a very strong game that rewards frequent play, as you get to know the cards better and exploit their potential.  This helps you appreciate that it's not just a game about incremental gains and losses - they can add up if you're clever.

I like this one, the theme fits quite well and the components of the spanish version that I have are very well designed. Nevertheless something doesn´t work for me. I don´t know what it is, but maybe I expected a more strategic game than a tactical one. I have doubts on the replayable value also as the cards of a given candidate always give you the direction you have to follow. Not my kind of "perfect" 2 player game. I still prefer twilight struggle.

Of the various games to adapt the Twilight Struggle engine, this is probably my favorite.  I love the idea of treating a Presidential election as a wargame, and if ever an election was war, it was the Kennedy/Nixon race.  Great gameplay (naturally), and the mechanics fit the theme possibly even better than they do in TS itself.  The debate phase feels a bit tacked on, but this is still a great game.

[b]Thumbs Down[/b] after one game. We found the impacts of debate to be too weak (even if you invest lightly, and your opponent heavily, the odds are very high that you can force no worse than a 7-2 loss... and a 5-cube difference will be more than offset by the better cards you played on the board). I would be inclined to then have 3 of the 5 cards be my opponent's biggest events buried, which lessens the impact of momentum (which already seems weak). This in turn weakens issues. 

So, what's left to actually care about is the tit-for-tat influence struggle, which is really simplistic and boring. Also, it seems some events are just really killer windfalls.

Objectively speaking, it's a very interesting design with great chrome, but that's not enough for me to make up for a dull game.

Rating a strong "8" after reviewing rules, components, a few sample game turns, and then two complete games. This game is an utterly brilliant effort. I lost the second game by a single electoral college vote ... unbelievably 269 to 268 playing as Nixon. What a blast! 

Absolutely outstanding game on many levels ... mechanics, flow, atmosphere, interaction, fun (yes, an election game that's fun!), quality of components, elegance, clarity of rules, overall fun factor during gameplay. 

Any fan of CDGs owes it to themselves to try this masterpiece. Brilliant.

Not as great as Twilight Struggle -- additional elements of TS like the frequent restirring of the deck (and cards coming back later in the game) are complexities that 1960 lacks. But on its own merit, this is a good game that gets extra points for nailing its theme. Keep up the great work, Jason!

I really love Twilight Struggle.  I was hoping this would be similar, and in some ways it is.  However, the tension that requires your opponents events to trigger when you play their cards is missing in 1960.  
Perhaps that is what was intended in the design, to make it a little more friendly to play.  
Don't get me wrong, this is a fun game, it is just missing a bit of the tension that makes Twilight Struggle so great.  
I can get my wife to play this one also!

Good game, but just the one "scenario" (i.e., 1960). Low complexity and would work well if you're looking to play something with family members (including children down to 10 years). Plays quickly and a good "starter" type of game if introducing someone to boardgaming beyond Milton Bradley.

I can't believe my game Adobe, Stone and Steel shares so many mechanics with this one.  The luck is a little hard to swallow but seems to balance out.  My friend had a free 15 OPS before I had any good events.  A decent game, below TS, but fits a special niche nicely.  Looking forward to some more plays. The  cards and history are fantastic, the ideas, and mechanics are clever, I just was hoping for a bit more strategy and ability to protect your investment, but again I guess that fits the theme. It may fit the theme but it's not really a fun game for a seasoned gamer.

No me gustan demasiado este tipo de juegos, el problema es que hay que saberse las cartas, y me da pereza jugarlo tanto como para ir aprendiéndolas, pero todo esto es un problema mío, el juego en sí está muy bien, tenso y con mucho sabor histórico
Tras una segunda partida, y tras haber probado el TS, me ha decepcionado mucho este juego, la importancia de la colocación en el mapa es nula, al menos al durante gran parte de la partida, hay eventos "matadores" que si le tocan a un jugador u otro acaban por cargarse la partida. En fin, que le he bajado la nota drásticamente y estoy pensando en venderlo.

Area control game that has much in common with its half-brother Twilight Struggle. Card interactions are more straight forward, making this a good introductary war ... I mean, conflict simulation. 

After two plays, I can't see the payoff in campaigning in the South or the West -- handle Texas and California with Events, and get maximum bang for your CP buck by staying in the East or Midwest for extended periods of time.

Good theme, great components, meh game.

RATING: 9
Outstanding game by Christian Leonhard and Jason Matthews, the Designer of [gameid=12333]. So many layers of interest, brilliantly meshed together to create a truly nail-biting experience. Each card from your hand can be used as Campaign Points to gain favor in a particular region (4 total regions, across the USA map), move to another region, gain media coverage in a region (which makes takeovers easier), gain Endorsements (which wins all undecided states in a region, during the last round election), to gain points in issues (points in Civil Rights, Defense, and Economy gain momentum and/or endorsements), or as an Event. The Events are historical events that happened during the election and they are played out in game terms (such as adding or removing campaign cubes to and from certain states or regions). The catch is that when you use a card for something other than an Event, the opposing player can hijack the event for himself and use it against you! This design is so solid and approachable, I think it could appeal to almost any gaming audience.

A streamlined version of Twilight Struggle ... and a good one at that. I give the edge to 1960, because TS always starts to drag on me. I think 1960 brings a lot of the same emotions with a shorter gameplay and less of a chance that you lose track of things on the board.

I love how its essentially an area-control/ war game disguised as a political match. Good history throughout!

I'm not very keen on card driven games in general, however this game strikes me as a quite impressive one.  The tension from turn to turn is very high as one has to constantly adapt plans to the unfolding events. The only problem is that there are three problems: 1) the game is a bit too long, 2) cards can be very unbalanced and 3) sometimes all the turns seem very repetitive, which can be a drag for a game two hours long.

RATING: 7
Looking at the components, reading the rules and playing through half a game for familiarity I had hopes that this may be a 9  game.

However after playing, albeit only once, I'm not so sure. It is a good game and definitely one of the best mechanics to theme fits I have played. However it is subject to a large amount of luck in terms of the card draw - I'm hoping that over 7 hands of cards this will normally average out to a closer game, however in the first game I played it did not. On 3 turns out of 7 I was playing with approx 12CP v 18CP and on two of those turns had events which primarily favoured my oponent whilst he was able to hit with several uber event cards that allowed placing of 5-7 state control. Two of the debates were tied therefore going to the player with the initiative which is decided on a cube pull from the bag. My oponent played a solid game but there was no way that I could have won this.

I still enjoyed the game as the mechanics and theme are great but I am concerned that it can be beset by a degree of luck that can skew the game so much. Looking forward to playing again but with fingers crossed that the first playing was just a series of freaky deals.

1960: The Making of the President was an anniversary gift from my girlfriend to me. I played it twice after receiving it, and each time I found it interesting but not quite there for me. It was somewhat enjoyable, and I like playing it when the game comes up, but a lot of the decisions seem to be made on auto-pilot. When I am playing the game, I am playing the game, I am not "absorbed" into the game. I guess that part of it is that I wish the game was just a little bit heavier. A little bit more involved decision-wise. A little bit less about tit-for-tat exchanges and more about interesting and exciting moves. Instead it just ends up being slightly procedural and underwhelming.

When I acquired Twilight Struggle, I realized that it was everything I wanted 1960 to be and more and got rid of my copy.

Players represent Nixon and Kennedy fighting out the 1960 US presidential campaign.  Essentially a card driven wargame combined with a Die Macher-esque competition for US state seats.  The seats are worth different amounts of electoral votes, ranging from 45 down to 3, and players have to claim around 270 votes to win.  Cards are played to sprinkle influence cubes across the states, media and major issues (defence, economy, civil rights).  Some neat ideas, including the "rest cup" to replenish cubes, momentum to trigger/deny events, the debate midway through the game, as well as the final election where swings are still possible.  Neat, well developed game, that seems geared to providing exciting finishes.  A few bits feel clunky, but overall quite a solid game.  Fantastic presentation, components are of excellent quality too.

Updated now that I have played the published game:  This is a lean card-driven influence game. It is similar to Twilight Struggle but with only a fraction of the rules overhead. It has a great new innovation to triggering events in the game. If an opponent's card has an t want, it might or might not happen depending on whether you want to the spend precious momentum tokens. But your opponent can also spend to affect this as well... a great new twist to the system.  Also in the mix is a clever interaction between regional advertising, dominating the issues, and framing the relative importance of the issues. These are all great fun and make the whole thing an engaging, interlocking series of give-or-take decisions. My rating reflects my dislike of the fact that card draws trump board play. Highly tactical and you are just reacting to complicated cards. I felt this was a slight problem in Twilight Struggle, but here it is more pronounced. If this  didn't bother you about TS, then there's no reason why you wouldn't like 1960 even more than TS.  The production, art, and presentation are absolutely top-notch, kudos to Z-Man and the design team!

I loved this theme, setting, and history of this game.  Unfortunately, the game just wasn't exciting or very fun to play.  I didn't really feel like my decisions mattered, it mostly seemed like the card draw would ultimately decide everything.  The game also required a lot of cube-pushing without much to gain from it.

about 2 hours-ish for this, although I've yet to play someone a second game as yet, to see how experience speeds it up. One of the things that drops this from being played a bit is that it's 2 player. Usually there are at least 3 people around who want to play a board game, usually more, so 1960 generally gets pushed to one side. I'll have to make the time, I quite enjoy it, and am hoping Z-man bring out some expansions for it. Don't know how, though....

I finally played a thoroughly enjoyable game of 1960.  There were many cards used for the events and many used for the CP.  Game was pretty close the whole time from my point of view with no player ever being ahead by more than 100 or so.  For once I felt the tension!  I've played this game about 5 times now and can highly recommend it.

As noted by others, very similar to Twilight Struggle.  I really like the theme in this game.  Very unique compared to other heavy 2-player titles.  Also not super long, with a usual game clocking in around 2 hours.  There are some aspects of Twilight Struggle that make it a better game than this one in my opinion.  Those aspects primarily being the midgame scoring, and mid/late game card additions to the deck.  On the other hand I feel the lack of dice in 1960, and the inclusion of the political capital bag were very nice additions that made the game feel less luck-based.  Also somewhat annoying in 1960 is how you can preempt your opponents events, whereas in TS there is no way to stop opponents events from happening (except by discarding/keeping the card).

What a great birthday present! 

Played it once so far. Seems pretty good, but more than a little repetitive (you put cubes on, I take them off, you put them on, etc.), and very much Twilight Struggle-light. Which at least one person I know feels is a good thing. Me, I'm not so sure. 

Debates feel a little finicky, and advertising a weak link, but there is definitely strategy here, and I definitely want to play more to find it. 

Update: After 3 plays, my enthusiasm for this game seems to be less and less every time I play it - the opposite of Twilight Struggle. Should I keep it? I've played it with 2 players - one, my regular 2-player gaming partner doesn't care for it much, and the other, a good friend big into politics, who liked it a little better but still not that much. Where are the additional plays going to come from, and do I even want them? 

American themes are a pretty hard sell up here.

...AND that's that. (Math)traded it for Revolution! and The Palace after 4 plays.

Excellent game. Full of tension and tough choices. Timing of cards/momentum markers/debate issues and the bluffing involved makes for a fascinating experience.

Good production value with excellent rulebook. 

I'd say 1960 has more interesting card play, and Twilight Struggle has more interesting board/spatial positioning play. Also, I prefer the rest cubes over the dice in Twilight Struggle, and the debate over the space race.

Designed by one the designers of Twilight Struggle, this game has a very similar sort of feel, but it plays quicker. I prefer it to TS, and I really like the idea of the political capital bag to resolve chance, as the ratio of red to blue cubes changes throughout the game depending on your strength of cards played. Its shorter playing time also means I have been more successful at finding people to play it.

A good friend of mine told me about 1960: The Making of the President. He enjoys it alot.

Played 1960 just once. I'm not really fond of the mechanic of the game. Not exactly what I expected the game to be. Mechanic wise, 1960 reminds me of Twilight Struggle. In 1960, all cards has to be used. If you got good cards for your opponent, your screwed.
One differences is that in 1960, there is no dice rolling.
 
Hardly any difference if the card is played by you or your opponent. Also, I wonder if the game is balance. At first glance, it doesn't seem to be balance. Maybe I was playing my cards wrong.

I don't see how a long term strategy can work or at least worth while compared to short term goals. Game play can be repetitive. Not my favorite theme/mechanic for a board game.

Prefer Twilight Struggle than 1960 for this type of mechanic. At least you can use your bad cards you have in yours hands in space in Twilight Struggle.

There are too many better games out there that playing this game on a regular basis is a waste of time.

Fantastic game.  The combination of card play and area control lend themselves to an extremely tense two hour tug of war.  You will sweat, curse, and despair in this game of bitter rivalry.

RATING: 6.5
Long Game with some significant luck elements due to it being a card driven game,
pace of play may increase with more frequent play. Has a few niggly, yet important, 
rules (ie when events are played they are removed). But it is enjoyable to play 
yet the length, may make play infrequent. Essentially a game of managed chaos.

A derivate of Twillight Struggle that is easier to approach and less prone to extreme swings of luck. What bothers me is that sometimes the game goes on autopilot. There are events that are so powerfull that there is no sense not to play them. Also, it is ridiculously easy to remove opponent influence with events compared to using operations points.

RATING: 4
Nicely produced game with excellent bits, but lacking in interesting strategy decisions.  Fails to evoke the uncertainty and suspense of an electoral race.  The debate mechanic falls flat.  In all, playing the game seems almost like a chore.  Further, the rules need a bit of work, primarily in cross-referencing terminology, and the box is badly designed -- the bits don't go back in to the space provided.  Overall rating of 4 shows that I wouldn't be in a rush to get it to the table again.  In this genre, I prefer the Mr. President game from 1967 (http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/476).

RATING: 5
Nice design. Although I enjoy Twilight Struggle, I think 1960 solves a number of small issues I have with it.

1) Bad hands (CP-wise) are mitigated by Rest Cubes and Campaign Bag.
2) Bad hands (event-wise) are mitigated by Momentum.
3) More things to juggle (media, endorsements, issues, debates).
4) Scoring only happens at the end.

It's a simple system made complex by 91 unique events. Each card has 4 functions: event (for one or both players), campaign points (campaign, advertise, position), issue icon for debates, and state for election day. Each full game turn, you have either 6 or 7 cards. You need to decide which cards to play during the turn, and which you want to save for the debate/election day. For the debate, you generally want high-valued cards with your own icon and a symbol for the issue(s) you want to win. For election day, you want cards with states that have a chance of swinging your way with 3 support checks. In both these cases, you don't know exactly what you might need at the beginning of the turn (and less so in earlier turns), and you may even change your mind as the events play out.

I have changed my mind on this. After playing it a bit, I now understand why TS works the way it does, and I enjoy it more.

Great first play. Great rules. Great art on the game. 

2nd play: This game is very solid and definitely deserves the rating it has. It loses a point for length with me. If you're interested in a meaty two player game, pick this up!

Oh, the card-driven element of the game is interesting. These cards give the game a "work with what you're given" effect that makes the game a little more interesting. This gives the game some of the rigidity of a card-based game mixed with the freedoms a traditional board game gives.

Similar to Twilight Struggle but with several advantages. The game design is practically the same as TS but it's at half the length, which leads me to wonder what is all that wasted time in TS for. The theme also works better here than in TS. An ok effort but it's not exactly the best of CDGs - strategy-wise. Advertisements and endorsements don't seem all that useful and deciding whether to play an event or CPs is usually pretty obvious.

After six plays I am a solid fan of this game.  It is natural to compare it to Twilight Struggle.  It is lighter and more streamlined than its older brother.  I don't agree, though, that it is more luck driven.  The theme is immersive, the gameplay brisk, and the endgame tense.  I love it.

One play of this, and as I recall, it felt kind of tug-of-war -- when I did something over here, my opponent did something over there.  I would think every game of this would be close which sounds like an attribute, but I think it’s just because the game is locked into a move-countermove-move kind of gameplay and whoever gets the  last countermove wins. Maybe there’s more to it, but I’m not in a hurry to find out as Twilight Struggle exists.

RATING: 8
A superb game, consistently delivering a very enjoyable 2 hours. After five or six outings, I certainly prefer 1960 to TS. The Debate mechanic is more nuanced than the Space Race, I prefer the political capital and rest mechanic to TS's dice rolling, and I like the fact that to cause a friendly event to occur, one must expend momentum in 1960.

Basically this a card-driven area control game with lots of opportunities to mess with your opponent.

An interesting take on the asymmetrical 2-player system, popularized by Twilight Struggle. The political twist lends itself to a lighter tone than Twilight Struggle, somewhat ironically, with much of the historical context written in as flavor text on the cards.
The most interesting thing about this game is the end-game scoring, which borrows from many euro-style games. The game is divided into the weeks leading up to the election, culminating, like the real thing, with a tallying of the electoral votes. While this method of scoring is sometimes frowned upon as anti-climatic, it lends itself well to the theme creating an intense Election Day showdown.

(2 players) I like it! I was never crazy about trying to get into Twilight Struggle due to the fact that you really have to know the card deck. This game has very little of that (if any) and it's a joy. Some tough decisions and lots of options for play. The advertising portion of the game seems a bit weak as it never seems much worth it to invest in that.

NT Want to play this more. But here on my initial thoughts. 

- the cards are swingy...and I'm someone who love Age of Renaissance. I had a -2 to ops played on me on a turn where half of my hand was opponents events. It felt hard to recover from.

- with lots of play it may be possible to anticipate events but, without the division of the cards to appear at certain times, there will be more chaos generally than I expect in a CDG. 

- it's not clear is superior play will win this game all of the time, maybe even most of the time. 

- the theme is well integrated and I liked it a lot. I did feel like american politics. 

The jury is out, could be a fav, could be a really frustrating game I don't play often.

I have only played this game twice so far, and I'm absolutely loving it!  It takes a while to explain and setup (a lot of pieces & tokens to place), along with a considerable amount of rules to learn.  But eventually it all clicks.  It's a neat blend of area control, bluffing, and a slick card-driven system that allows players many options in playing their hands.  It's exciting to see how a particular move can have deep "ripple effects" that impact other layers.

I haven't played Twilight Struggle yet, but from what I hear it's even better than 1960:TMofP (but also longer).  Until then, I must say this is an outstanding game as it provides a highly engrossing experience.  Both games took nearly 3 hours (with setup & rules explanation).  Even so, the time flew on by.  It's really a treat to have this much FUN, TENSION, and AGONIZING choices tightly woven in a 2-player game.  If there is anything I can remotely complain about, there *MAY* be a slight clunkiness in how the Debate Phase works.  Perhaps it's there to help fit the election theme?  Or maybe this "clunkiness" is just my imagination.

I also love the tension of building the campaign strategy decks.  It's not only a great way to get rid of unfavorable cards (like the Church in San Juan), but it also accelerates the tension.  Both the debate and election phases are great "battles" where players run like mad attempting to push states in their favor before the final election.

Excellent job Jason & Chris!  Grade: A

Played 3 times with 2 players for 5.25 hours.

AUG/13: Rating 8. I'm not a "Influence Game" fan (I used to hate El Grande) but this game is designed for 2-players is quite tight. The biggest thing though: the theme in this game really works for me. In fact, theme is so important to my enjoyment of this game, that I think that non-Americans may enjoy this significantly less than Americans. (I'm not American, but I've lived there and know a fair bit about the politics.) It's definitely a swingy (i.e. tactical) game where the better player can lose, but it's just so much fun! My only concern is medium-term replayability.

You'ld swear you're playing Twilight Struggle except for a few subtleties which add up to a big difference.

My wife and I played our first game tonight.  It took a while because we had some questions while playing and were both really tired when we began.  Overall, the game feels deep and fun.  We both loved the history-based nature of the game.  For our first game Kennedy won by a large majority.

I think next game we'll have a better sense in understanding how to prepare for the Debates and Election Day.

Great game and very much looking forward to more plays.

Added blue and red wooden cubes from a Risk set.

It seems to take us too long to play this game however.  Not sure why.  Also, I always lose this game to my wife.

Played twice now. This is definitely a game where you want to do more than you can at any given time, and there are a lot of agonizing choices to be made: 

Do I play this card as an event or for points?
Will my opponent try to trigger this event?
Which cards do I save for Campaign Strategy?

...and so on. I also love the "tug of war" that happens in each state and on the issues tiles. I have an unfortunate tendency to get Endorsements and Advertising confused, so I need to brush up on that and how the Debates work.

Fantastic game. I can't wait to play it again, along with its cousin Twilight Struggle.

I find this to be a brilliant game. It compares, or course, to Twilight Struggle in the mechanics and method of play. I find this to be enormously superior, fun wise. I never find that I've got a hand of cards that is so bad I can't do anything with it, I never feel as if one side or the other is completely out of contention. There are a lot of things in this game to balance, and I'm not very good at balancing them. Still, it's a long and deep game that I've played several times, liked every time, even though I've lost every time. That must mean it's a good time.

The component quality is top notch. My personal experience after 2 plays is that the game is very easy to learn and to teach to a player who has never played a similar game before. It plays really fast. The first game took about 3 hours. We had to check the rules a lot. But the second game took about 90 minutes. 

There's great tension until the end of the last turn and the players face very difficult and agonizing decisions during the game. Replay value is moderately high, since every play makes you want more but to what end, I don't know. 

This game gets a solid 9 from me. The reason why I don't give it a 10 is that the cubes are never enough. 2 plays and we always ran out of cubes in the final 2-3 turns.

Avis personnel : Peut-être mon meilleur jeu à deux joueurs. Très immersif avec son système de Card Driven/évènements historiques. Les photos en noir et blanc sur les cartes sont là pour nous faire vivre l'époque.
Le système de tirage au sort pour connaître qui a l'initiative durant le tour est bien pensé sachant qu'il est possible aux joueurs d'intéragir sur les probabilités des tirages.
La présence d'un jeu dans le jeu avec le débat télévisé qui vient durant un tour perturber le fonctionnement classique des règles.
Asymétrique, il est agréable de jouer l'un ou l'autre et très souvent tendu de gagner. Les joueurs se rendent coup pour coup et devront compter sur l'aide des médias pour s'en sortir.
Le matériel est de bonne qualité et le jeu permet de bien comprendre le système électoral indirect américain.

I don't think I've ever played a CDG for the first time and not had any rules questions.  It's very clear with excellent rules.  I have a strong bias towards this game due to my enjoyment of Twilight Struggle, and so far 1960 gets close to the mark.  It's as boiled down as a card driven game with events can get and It gives a clean euro feel with all the theme of the events and card photos.  I like the fact that with a card like 'Nixons knee' for example, you're only moving your token to Maryland for the event but the graphic on the card and the text create a story about why Nixon was in Maryland and what the knee injury meant to his campaign.  It's a tight look at a year in history and it really draws me in.  I'm a political cartoonist and a history buff and this game is right up my alley.    Plays in about two hours and will teach you something about elections.  Very high level of decision stress for both players as well.  I hope we see expansions for this game to include other close elections(Truman/Dewey 1948).

Update:   Lowering my rating from a 9 to an 8.  I'm not sure how much it matters what you do in this game.  The system seems to go back and forth across the board by itself.  It has a feeling that whatever I do on my turn, you will undo on your turn.  In the end it's fun but I never feel like I'm in control or choosing a strategy.  I guess it's all tactical and not strategic.

While it's not as engrossing as Twilight Struggle, it's shorter. I love the election day support checks.  They give the feel of waiting around on election day to see if there are going to be any big upsets.  Definitely use the variant for placing cubes into the issues.

Unfortunately, after many plays I feel like all the cards are sort of the same.  In Twilight struggle there's just a wider variety of things that can happen because you're awarded points throughout the game and because the adjacency rules for influence, placement can make any country crucial at some point in the game; timing matters.  The gathering momentum cards just don't have half the tension or meaning that the scoring cards do in TS.  Still, 1960 is an amazing game, it just doesn't have that "it" factor that makes me want to play it more the more I play.

This rating was a tough one for me. I liked everything about this game except the length of it. That is really what is driving the low rating. The game pieces and board are excellent. The mechanics are intuitive and the theme is a 10. Problem is this game is advertised as a 90 minute game and yeah there is always some variability in that based upon familiarity with the game but the game took my wife and I three and a half hours to play with minimal rules references. I put this one with Arkham Asylum - great game, too damn long.

RATING: 6
This is an all-right game, but the gameplay is definitely missing something for me.  For example, one way TS introduced tension was due to significant bottlenecks on its map: you had to get there before the opponent, else your game became a lot harder; here there are very few such tension-inducing bottlenecks.  Comments proclaiming it the "best election game EVAR" seem overhyped to me.  The first five rounds are very "samey"-feeling as cubes are placed about the board; round 6 breaks the pattern -- but only to place a further four-five cubes -- then it's back to the same old thing again before some cube-twiddling in the election round.  In the end it feels like a three-turn game that takes ten turns to play.

Kennedy vs. Nixon. Cool them. Despite a very different theme, this is basically an inferior version of Twilight Struggle.  Fairly well-designed with beautiful components (I love the board), but not quite Twilight.  The zero-sum nature of this game causes a lot of repetitive tit-for-tat gameplay.

A very interesting euro-style game oozing with typically "american" theme. As such it would be worth a 9 or a 10. I still rate it an 8 because I consider that the mechanics are a little on the luck side, with some kind of "toss the coin" finish that can tip the game one way or another. This would not normally disturbs me, but for such a long game it feels a little anti-climactic.

An absolutely superb game that keeps you involved until the final vote has been counted.

I'm not totally sure what to make of this. As an object it's wonderful, of course: massive great board, all this electoral paraphernalia, flavour text explaining what the cards are about on the actual cards (instead of relegated to the booklet like Twilight Struggle). As a game... well, I do enjoy it, I've played it twelve times now, but its tug-of-war, zero-sum nature means there's not all that much palpable sense of progress, means the board state has a lot of toing and froing, and the fact that so many events alter state support means the already pretty minor sense of geography that dividing the board into regions gives is further undermined. But I do enjoy it, it's got a great theme and implements it well. I dunno, maybe it's just not a theme that lends itself to a game I'll love.

Current favorite long two-player game. I do not feel the need, as some players do, to use a house rule that takes some of the focus off of the issue tiles. I really like the momentum tiles that you have to use to preempt or play the cards' events, and the rest cubes which let players who get fewer powerful cards avenge themselves through the draw bag later on. This game is engaging, elegant, and dynamic from the first turn to the last.

A fun, pared down version of Twilight Struggle.  The game is beautifully produced and simple to learn. The Debate phase is a bit of a let down.

However, it is simply the finest game about the US Presidental election available.

02/22/08--Solid.  Wonder how it would hold up to heavy repeat plays...not sure it would fare too well.  There really don't seem to be that many "game changers" in terms of events, not to a degree where a particular game would vary wildly from another.  Nice effort, I really want to play Twilight Struggle now.

EDIT:  After you play it more than once, you find it out it's the same tug-of-war game after game.  It's too easy to undo what your opponent does, very much unlike Twilight Struggle where that's often simply not possible to easily undo something immediately after.  It makes the gameplay stale.

The issues are busted, and suffer from the same tug-of-war.  Worse because geography isn't even a factor.

You would think "carrying" a state would help against this, but there are so many cards that directly add influence and bypass those bag checks completely.  There's no hurry to get them; you don't score until the end, and those influence cards will come around eventually.  Until then, just put out the fires that are the easiest and cheapest to deal with.

I like the theme a lot.  I like the art direction and the cards.  But playing the game itself?  Literally, this is like a three-play and done game.  Shame, I wanted to like this one.

I don't know, it just seemed a bit bland after Twilight Struggle. It's almost the same game and admittedly one game isn't enough to appreciate the subtle differences but although the production value is somewhat better, it didn't click as well with us. I think the theme plays a part in that, it's just not as exciting to decide the result of an election (crucial as it is) as to play with the fate of the world on the brink of nuclear war. Anyway, it clearly suffered from the comparison and would probably get a higher rating if I hadn't played twilight Struggle first but I have, so there.

1960 offers a strong campaign simulation for two players, as you vie for electoral control by influencing media, spinning hot debate issues, and good old fashioned hob-nobbing with the people.  This is of course abstracted through card play and cube placement, but 1960 does a strong job of fastening itself to the applied theme.  All decisions are of vast importance determining best strategies and also tactically responding to your opponents moves.  1960 offers a tension filled couple of hours, usually in close contention, until the final count.  Wonderfully produced by Z-man, elevating it above other games in the genre for me.  Also the theme is not tired, and offers a great change from the usual renaissance, viking, and ancient civilization themes that have all been beaten to death and then some.

Very interesting twist on the Twilight Struggle framework. A must buy for anyone interested in elections, presidential in particular. The theme is well carried out on the cards and the fight for state influence. So, it's really all about the cubes (area control over states to win the most electoral votes). It felt very balanced & quicker playing than TS, though not necessarily a better game (I still prefer the gameplay & theme of TS). Still, it's worth keeping around for sure, when there's not enough time for TS and one needs to scratch that similar itch.

 From Secret Santa 2008. Thanks! 1st playing. The game was not as easy as I thought it would be. There is a lot going on that needs to be remembered. It is easy to forget to do things. or to figure out a strategy when you first play the game. Hopefully another play will help out with the confusion. Till that time the game gets a middle 5 rating with hopes that the number goes up soon. Also should have many more markers. If your strategy is to get complete control of many states 4 markers times a number of states equals no markers remaining to play. What happens then?

Quite good game with interesting theme. However, there are some issues.

Luck factor is too high and some cards are bit too powerful. A It is a bit frustrating losing Pennsylvania and New York (with 4 & 5 cubes) in the last half of last turn with some really powerful card combination. Basically nothing I could do about that.

Also the media and issues should be bit more powerful.

I hope I won't lower the rating after next game.

Good game when taken by itself without TS comparison.  It is more bite sized and relies less on card knowledge.  It's also far more tactical, to my mind.  Games tend to be very tense and games often are resolved in a single state in the last turn.

What is really missing here is more positional/geographical play, which I very much like in TS.  And the exquisite thematic play with paranoia and brinksmanship.

This is Twilight Struggle young brother. It is easier, faster and I prefer its theme although I must admit that the inclusion of the scoring cards makes TS more thrilling in the scoring and overall I think that the old fellow is crearly a better game. Anyway, 1960 is a neat game and I find it way more easy to play with newbies. The components  are above average standards, with a very good cardboard and wonderful designed cards, I bought a special set of actual 1960 election campaing pins to replace the momentum markers, a fine adition. Very good card driven game, my second favourite one in its category only after Twilight Struggle. I own the spanish edition which is really beautiful.

This is a good game, but I miss the subtlety, the nervous tension, the sharper focus, and the much greater level of planning that goes into Twilight Struggle.  1960 is much closer to a so-called "Eurogame," so I suspect it will have broader appeal.  Having played a lot of Twilight Struggle, 1960 comes across as a bit bland in comparison.  There's not much to distinguish the states except for their number of electoral votes.  Consequently, you're mostly just trying to drop as many cubes into as many high-value states as possible, and ignoring the less efficient, smaller states unless you can gain a bunch of small-state cubes in one broad stroke.  As a result, every turn feels very much the same as the previous turn.  The core card play system is so enjoyable, though, that the game is worth playing despite my disappointment with the board play.  The game's best new feature is the concept of momentum, a resource that can be spent to activate favorable events on your opponent's cards.  This works very well and generates difficult decisions.  A momentum advantage can be very powerful in the early and middle portions of the game, although it becomes less important in the final two turns when it's easier to bury your opponent's most powerful events.

It's a good game but the endorsements ruin it for me.  They are too random and far too powerful.  A person can take your entire region of unoccupied states by the luck of the draw and you might get an endorsement for a region you already own.  Each endorsement card should give a choice of region for either political side.

I still prefer Twilight Struggle.

One play. I enjoyed it, though I'm not 100% sold on it yet. I agree with a lot of the stuff that Chris Farrell has said in his comments; there's stuff in there that looks good on paper but doesn't add much to the game (the media, the advantage of "carrying" a state). The debate seems like it might add an element of long-term strategy, but I'm not sure the payoff is good enough or certain enough when compared against the usefulness of being able to ditch cards that are helpful to your opponent. Also, it felt like the game was was more about short-term tactics rather than long-term strategy; certainly you need to decide how much energy to devote to this or that and where you want campaign, but most of the thinking that needs do be done revolves around how one can get the most from one's hand. Regardless, I definitely need to try it again to be able to say anything for certain.

Lacks the depth of Twilight Struggle but it is more accessible, quicker to play, and requires fewer rules checks over the course of a game. I like the theme at least as much as in Twilight Struggle, although I can see where that almost certainly won't be the case for a world-wide audience. I will probably burn out on this and then return to Twilight, but it promises to be a fun ride. At minimum, worth bringing out once a year or so. Very handsome production values, too -- on a physical quality level I'm hard-pressed to identify a better-produced game in my library. I think keeping a running tally of electoral votes is probably critical beginning with the debates turn, otherwise the endgame will seem even more chaotic and arbitrary. The game does generate a narrative (Nixon steals the election with a re-count in Texas!), and the opportunity for puns and jokes abound if you know even a little bit of history. And if you don't know your history, you can still say, "Dick, you don't know Jack!" A winner.

1960 : The Making of the President is a good 2 player game where each player try to become the US President.
You have a set of cards that you can play as an Event or use the Campaign point.  These Campaign point can be use to :
- Do campaign in a state
- Advertising in a region
- Positioning on issues

There is also a debate and the election day.
The player who have the more votes after the election day wins the game.

2008 acquisition.

Rating is only based on 1 game with another virgin player.  It was a very nice game with a tonnes of theme and a few of things that need to be attended to throughout the game.  Do I spend my CPs on media contro, do I spend them on the Issues, should I use them to campaign in the different states, how should I play my cards and in what order, what cards should I save for the debate, etc.  I can imagine the enjoyment factor will increase with repeated plays as you'll get to know the different cards are and how best to use them.

Love this, and want to play this all the time. I am a dork for modern American history, so this, and Twilight Struggle are right in my wheelhouse for theme. For those who have played Twilight Struggle, 1960 will have some familiar elements, but plenty about it is different - I wouldn't go so far as to call it "TS-lite". You'll feel the push and pull (imagine the TS continuum-style scoring track as an abstraction) as large electoral vote-holding states bounce back and forth between each player's control. The first play will be a good 2 hours, but I would anticipate once both players are familiar with all of the cards, it could settle it at around 90 minutes.

We still don't know how to rate it. It seems good, but we have to check it more. So far I know (K) that I like 1960 MotP more than G ;) (theme!!)

EDIT
Well... I'm disappointed. I don't know why, but something doesn't work here. It's too random (one card in last turn can destroy all of your plans) and you cannot control this.  There's no situation in which you press your luck. everything's up to what you've got on your hands and some cards are too powerfull. I know that kinds of cards are on the both sides but it's too random to get yours and use it and to get your opponent and to block it, which makes play unbalanced... and last thing is that this game generates too much bad emotions. it's no so fun to loose a state which you've struggled to take. and again and again... I hope that Twilight Struggle is better than that. :) Maybe that's a lesson that we should not believe appearance, but bgg rating ... :)

The rules in this one are a bit hard to grasp, but the game plays really well. And the theme is so well integrated with gameplay, you might even learn some history!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.75
Initial rating of 8

The theme doesn't do much for me. I tend to not like games with a political theme, not to mention that this period of history is not all that thrilling to me. However, this game really is quite good.

Q: So, you don't like politics as a theme AND the history is not interesting to you, yet you rate this game above a 7?

A: Yes, I do. The mechanics of this game are very well done. Card driven area majority with plenty of circumstantial card play. 

One of the key elements is to recognize how each hand is best played and yet allow yourself some flexibility to react to your opponents card play. Many subtle factors come into play and are only learned through experience.

Q: These subtle factors, are they really difficult to grok? 

A: Probably for the first two or three plays, unless you are a CCG or card driven kind of person. I would suggest watching a few rounds and asking questions then trying it out with another noob or someone that will actually teach and explain what is happening during the course of your first play instead of feasting on your new blood.

After 1 play, I liked it a lot. Obviously very similar to Twilight Struggle, but at first blush I'd have to say I like TS better. The adding up of electoral votes at the end is extremely tedious, but in a way it adds to the suspense. I have some worries that the game may lack replayability, but ironically it will take another play to be sure. *UPDATE* After a second play, I'm still undecided. New York still seems to be the deciding factor, and is perhaps a game winner. My second game was very different from the first, which is definitely a good thing. Looking forward to a few more plays.

A very thematic eurogame that plays like a wargame. 1960 does an excellent job of every decision leading to the next in a strategic manner. The campaign points card play is easy to grasp, and I enjoy that everything stems form this one decision of campaign points vs. events. A perfect weight for a wargame-feel that offers engaging tactical and strategic decisions.

I have not played the GMT reprint, but the Z-Man edition is still an excellent choice. Did not feel like I was missing out on anything.

Excellent two player game.  Very thematic.  I would rate it higher, but I believe it is limited in the number of players you will find to play it with you and I wouldn't want to play it every day.

RATING: 7.5
1960: The Making of the President uses several of the same mechanisms found in Matthews' earlier design, Twilight Struggle.  The card-driven aspect, wherein cards can be used in a variety of manners, is very similar.  This is an extremely appealing mechanism, as it forces players to make vital decisions with the play of each and every card.  The tenseness and angst caused during this decision making process is considerable and, for me, the best part of the game.  Considerable research and care has been performed to insure that the cards have historical connections and reflect the ebb and flow of a presidential campaign.  The campaign deck seems well balanced, and the availability of the momentum markers allows players to trigger favorable events that may have escaped their use due to any "luck of the draw" occurrences.  There doesn't appear to be any undue built-in advantage for a particular candidate.

The game is certainly lighter and easier-to-understand than Twilight Struggle.   Twilight Struggle is a wonderful, tense and exciting game, but it is a bit rules-heavy with lots of detail and occasionally confusing situations.  It is not a game for the faint-of-heart.  1960: The Making of the President is considerably easier to learn and play, making it accessible for a wider audience.  Granted, the subject matter might not be as popular outside of the United States or appeal to a younger age group who may not have any interest in past presidential elections, but those willing to give it a try will find it far easier to become acclimated.   

Another advantage is that 1960 plays quicker than Twilight Struggle.  Most games can be played to completion in ninety minutes or so, and there is less downtime.  It is more straight-forward and less confusing, all factors that help the game move along at a brisk pace.  

That being said, the game does not appear to have the strategic depth of Twilight Struggle.  Plus, the board situation can and often does change dramatically.  While there are steps players can take to protect themselves and increase the odds in their favor, there is still a healthy dose of luck present, especially during the support checks.   The final shake-up caused by the rectifying of the campaign cards players have set aside during the final two turns can be dramatic and may actually swing the election.  While these support checks can be fun and exciting, they can also be frustrating as they are heavily dependent upon luck.  That may be distasteful to some.

While Twilight Struggle remains my favorite of the two designs (I'm a bit biased, though, as my Master's Degree concentration was World War II and the Cold War!), I find myself playing 1960: The Making of the President more often.  This is predominately due to the length of the game and the ease in teaching it to others.  It is a fun game that really does capture some of the atmosphere, excitement and uncertainties of a presidential campaign.  Surprisingly, given the nearly universal recognition and appeal of the subject, there are far too few good election games available.  Fortunately, 1960: The Making of the President is one of those few very good ones.

Played about 8 games and ultimately decided this one could move on to someone that will appreciate it more.

I really didn't appreciate Twilight Struggle.  But, I went ahead and picked this one up.  I have a degree in Political Science, so the topic I thought would be interesting.  I really enjoyed the game and really felt the theme was well down.  The choices seemed interesting and I liked how the game flowed.  I liked having to try and decided what cards to leave for the later debates.  It made me want to try Twilight again.

I'm not sure that I can see any reason to prefer this over Twilight Struggle--the debate turn is unsatisfyingly irrelevant, the game takes too long for what it is, and the momentum mechanic is a tad too flukey.

(Multizone, Mai 2012) Jeu que je n'arrive pas à vraiment apprécier: on met des cartes pour enlever des cubes dans les États dominés par l'adversaire et ajouter les cubes de notre couleur. L'adversaire enlève tes cubes et met ses cubes. On enlève et met des cubes continuellement. Les débats sont également pour enlever et ajouter des cubes. Et on pige des cubes dans un sac pour savoir qui a le momentum. Trop de cubes. C'est un jeu trop long à mon avis et je n'ai pas aimé le hasard des cartes (cartes qui peut te désavantager et avantager l'adversaire facilement sans qu'on ne peut y faire quoique ce soit).Je n'ai pas aimé non plus l'étape de la pige de cubes dans un sac pour voir qui a l'initiative et le momentum. J'ai trouvé l'étape des débats confus et pas vraiment nécessaire pour les résultats que cela donne (2 à 4 cubes de plus). Le décompte des États à la fin est assez complexe sans calculatrice. C'était assez long et je n'ai vraiment aimé la gestion des cartes et le thème (même si j'adore la politique) s'est révélé pour moi pas vraiment accrocheur. Le jeu est tout de même très beau esthétiquement.

RATING: 7
Note: My rating is for the Rules as Written.  You can easily house rule this up to an 8 or so.  

Overrated here on the geek, but does capture a lot of the CDG feel in a pretty short time frame.  Similar to Twilight Struggle, but lighter, shorter, and more euro-influenced. I do not like it as well as TS or HRVC and that is because I felt less in control of my own destiny.  The decisions are just easier in 1960.  Also, I think it has to do with the huge discrepancies of the electoral vote totals vs TS's more unpredictable scoring.  At a couple points during the game, I thought it should have been named 1960: the making of NY, PA, TX, Ill, CA, and a handful of side battles.  Its a solid game and perhaps all of the finer points haven't come out yet.Update: another play, and some of my lingering concerns are still lingering!  The game does not have the tension of Twilight struggle because you know when the scoring is going to happen.  The board geography is meaningless because its so cheap to move your candidate around.  The whole "control" mechanism where you can lock up a state is pretty meaningless because it doesn't effect event card play.  Advertising is heavily overcosted because you can break a "carried" state with events so easily.  The Debates are weak, and strategically, you gain a cube advantage by ignoring them most of the time.  Overall, the decisions just aren't really that interesting, you just add or subtract cubes for 90 minutes then count up the scores.  Nearly every hand you draw, you will have the same very basic decisions to make.  There will be a couple of really good events that will net you more cubes for the event than the CPs, there will be a couple of weaker ones that don't, or that aren't that good because of the situation on the board.  I did finally experience the "issue war" problem people have seen with repeated plays.  Very frustrating, and shows the problems with a lot of the side mechanisms in the game.  Easily fixed with a house rule, but obnoxious nonetheless.The game feels like it plays itself once you catch on to the optimization strategies with the cubes and control of different states.  In its attempt to be like a "tightly designed euro" 1960 took out all the tension and interesting decisions Twilight Struggle fans were hoping to get in a shorter package.  The game is so tightly designed and many of the decisions are so automatic that you will find a lot of games between good players are won by just a handful of votes.  Often, a lucky or unlucky support check at the end of the game, or one player forgetting about an election event can swing it.  This sort of designer-manufactured-tension is great, but won't play for twilight struggle fans.  We are used to the real thing!  The game is so close to being great, but so many of the mechanics and card interactions really contradict each other and encourage boring play.  I know thats the "balance" and "elegance" that eurogames seek to achieve and this was supposed to be the euro-fied CDG, but I'd like to tweak the game a little to fix these things.

If randomness was a serious problem in Twilight Struggle, it is bluntly lethal in this one.

Some events are way too powerful. And if you get lucky drawing the right cards when your opponent does not during a turn or two, your advantage can turn into a mountain impossible to climb.

Besides, there's little than someone can do to take advantage of your own candidate's most powerful events if 
they fall in your opponent's hands.

The black bag reminds me of the now-so-famous Shogun tower and its "impredictible" results.

And last but not least, all the thematic details as media support, issue support, endorsements or the debates (what a lamey depiction of the latter!) seem to be pretty much worthless. You are better off by focusing on placing as many cubes as you can in the most meaningful states and forget about the rest of the game.

All in all, a completely overhyped and overrated game that can be fun once in a while if you enjoy moving cubes all over the board.

Liked the cards, though. But this game does not deliver the thrill of being a candidate in an election campaign at all.

I certainly prefered the theme of Twilight Struggle - apart from that, this game improves on TS on every account: balanced sides, shorter duration, balance mechanisms for bad hands of cards, and of course much improved bits and graphical design.
As twilight Struggle, it is a game that needs to be played quite often to be enjoyed, because both players need to know the deck of cards quite well. 

Some interesting ideas like the media feel quite underused as there are too many occasion to skip them.

After two complete plays, I'm liking this game more and more. It's tactical and we have to adjust our strategies all the time. There's never enough resources or time to do everything, important decisions have to be made and every decision matters in the end which could alter the election result. A very high-tension game designed for two.
I just wish that the game board could present the real pictures rather than drawings to give the game more 60s touch and more materials, like real candidates' tokens instead of two wooden cylinders and more cubes. Even though we could replace those tokens by other things when there isn't enough left, it's still a pleasure and a comfort to have enough of everything for the game.

It's good but I wouldn't say it's as good as Twilight Struggle. I think in TS there's more tension because of the potential for an auto win at some point with the right card(s)

In this it's more just a case of calculating which state will get you the best bang for your CP. Sure the actions can be great but sometimes they can be no help at all.

I'd play again

RATING: 7
Great theme for an area majority game. Despite the obvious approach to Twilight Struggle, this game has its own merits and ends up working well and being tight at the end.

The Support Checks mechanism works well and there is a scope for grand strategy, amidst the tactical action/reaction of each turn and round. 

I found the momentum markers too powerful and I reckon that whoever controls momentum throughout the game end up winning.

RATING: 6
I like this game, but have lost some respect for it for one unbalanced reason. A player who focuses on the issues almost exclusively can be at a huge advantage against an opponent more interested in playing a balanced game of campaigning, influencing the issues, and using the text.

I would recommend using a variant where one can only influence the issues using a card that has the appropriate party and issue icons at the bottom. Makes for a stronger game.

Still, as is it is a good 2 player game.

Variant to reduce card draw swinginess: Election Day state draws go to the player whose event is on the card. So if your good cards aren’t drawn until last two turns, opponent doesn’t get out of them at no cost and get the good state draws from them to boot.

  Fun and deep but the cards can be too powerful at times.    I like that the debates break up the gameplay and give Kennedy an edge since Nixon seems to have the edge for the rest of the the game but with that said I don't like them.  Great theme, if it had any other theme it would have a lower rating from me.

Nice change of pace from Twilight Struggle. My biggest issue is that the deck is not split into Early, Mid & Late, like TS. So you get events that are simply not as good in the beginning of the game as they are at the end.

Ultimately it's a good game, but because it's 2p only, I won't play it very often.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The follow up game to Twilight Struggle manages to be superior to its predecessor in its production values and reduced playing time, but it's weaker everywhere else. Like all single deck CDGs it's very random and swingy, but on top of that there's a lot less to really think about than meets the eye. The game comes down to simply  getting cubes on the board, especially in the big states like New York and California (which is entirely dictated by the theme). There are plenty of false choices attempting to distract you from this simple purpose: Media is rarely worth investing in and the West is rarely worth campaigning in, but once these are ignored the player drawing the higher value cards will inevitably triumph. Initially I loved this for its political theme, but after 3 plays I felt I'd seen everything that was on offer here.

RATING: 8
Great production values from Z-man, like the game, but lacks the tension of Twilight Struggle. (Which may be a good thing if your opponent dislikes the conflict aspect of TS)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Well, this is really interesting and I think I'd like to play it some more and see how it really works.  First impressions tell me that Kennedy has some really good cards, but it's really easy to be seduced by the cards away from sensible campaigning. What is difficult is managing the rest cubes. They do depend heavily on what cards you draw, but I suppose it ought to balance out with everything else.. with experienced players it probably works out so that the less successful player gets to be luckier.  A clever idea. 

I love love love the theme (even though it means I failed to stop Nixon from becoming president early!!! ), and I like the twists and turns of the game.  It's a satisfying length and an absolutely gorgeous board.  

Still, it's hard to love the game when there is such a sense of things I don't understand.  I'll probably rate it higher later... (1 play)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I would have given this a 9 purely based on the rules. This game has lots of mechanics I really like, card driven, luck mitigation, untrackable secret information and no stupid coup luck ;). 

Having now played though I felt it was rather lack luster. This is purely an initial impression and I will need to play more. To be honest I felt a similar way about twilight struggle untill I played it a bit more and appreciated the subtelty, this I suspect will be the same. At the moment though it felt like it was less than the sum of its parts.

In no way is this a bad game, but I just not feeling the real urge to play it again and again, like twilight struggle.

Hopefully I will grow to love this game.
Update: It has grown on me a little, but not enough yet to justify a ratings change.

Excellent game on one of the most interesting US presidential elections.  Strange title aside, this game has almost everything.  Lots of fun, interesting gameplay options, and fairly strong history.  Players take turns playing cards, which can be used to send their candidates campaigning, purchase advertising, position on issues, or trigger historical events.  The events bring out an enormous amount of historical flavor and are well integrated into the gameplay for the most part, although a couple of the events that historically were crippling to Nixon don't seem all that powerful here (his knee injury and his pledge to visit all fifty states).  There is some debate as to the efficacy of advertising and the power of issue positioning.  I find the former to be fine but the latter to be a bit overpowered.  A small variant of prohibiting using cards to place positioning cubes on the issue denoted on the card has solved this problem for me.

The only major knock against the game is that it only covers one election.  I'd like to see a 1968 expansion, since it could reuse the same gameboard.  That election is interesting in that it could work quite well as either a two or three player game.

Feels too long for what it is. Too much push and pull that has little effect. Due to that is tad boring at times. Does not have the constant tension of Twilight Struggle and Labyrinth.

Tug of war in itself is fine, but I much prefer one that is short and intense, rather than drawn out and boring.

Man, I don't think I've ever played a game that left me quite as frustrated (even days later) as 1960.  Granted, this is because I would have won the election if not for the Election cards that lost me control of California and Illinois (I played as Nixon), either of which would have given me the victory (fairly close to real life I suppose...). I obviously underestimated the power of the election cards and didn't realize there were only 3 of them in the deck, so my strategy would be quite different in the future (I had both the Kennedy Election cards in my hand and definitely would have sacrificed them in the debate if I had realized how important 5 support checks are during the election).  I think a knowledge of the deck is necessary to play 1960 effectively, perhaps even more so than Twilight Struggle since the cards are much more powerful in 1960 and many of them are focused on a few battleground states.  

The game is an interesting variation of the Twilight Struggle mechanics, but I couldn't help thinking during the game that I would rather be playing Twilight Struggle.  1960 seems much more random to me, with wild swings back and forth and the events weighted towards the high-value states (thematically relevant perhaps, but still frustrating to focus so much on one state only to see your efforts wiped out with an opponents' card).  I prefer Twilight's Struggle's limitations in terms of influence placement - to me it requires much more careful planning and actually increases the tension as you try to plan several moves ahead to accomplish your objective.  1960 feels much more rushed and chaotic - again, thematically appropriate, but to me not quite as satisfying.

I'll have to give this one another try - hopefully another go will get rid of the slightly bitter taste in my mouth.

Un juego de mayorías muy interesante. Intentas hacerte presidente de los Estados Unidos a través de dominar los diferentes Estados, influyendo en los medios y ganando los temas en los debates. 

Un juego abstracto, temáticamente muy bien pensado que se ve reflejado tanto en sus acciones como a medida que transcurre del juego. Equilibrado y tensionante, tiende a generar análisis-parálisis. El arte es estupendo, como ambientación las cartas van contando momentos históricos de las elecciones entre Kennedy y Nixon. Me basto una sola partida para que estuviera en mi top.

1st played 12/11/07. Taught ~15min, played ~2hrs. Probably speeds up a bit after acquainted w/ cards. Players are presidential candidates Nixon/Kennedy. Players start off with pre-set amount of % support (shown as cubes; empty is 50/50) from certain state (some are split/empty). Your job to campaign, advertise, gain endorsements, & debate to win over votes. Board is 4 regions and requires a campaign point(CP) to move one adjacent region. A marker shows your location. Cards have 2-4CPs on them which you use to place a cube(s) in a state(s), poll for endorsements, or advertise in a region. For polling, you draw cubes from the bag of cubes which gets replenished from the rest area. A 2CP card rewards 2 rest cubes. (cards add up to 4) Cards also have a special action listed which you could do instead. Example: own majority in a region, place one cube on each unoccupied state. If it benefits your opponent then he can play a momentum chip (MC) to do that action. Playing two MCs block him. End of each round the issue track (of 3) is evaluated with the leader getting endorsements and/or MCs depending on the priority of each. A debate for support in round 6. Most support wins. A bit long for me however it held my interest throughout. I'd recommend giving it a game play to decide.

Very smart game.  I really enjoyed playing this one.  

There's a bunch of moving parts, but 1960 is a very teachable game.  It only took me one example turn to pick up the gist of how to play.

I absolutely love the sense of history that is captured in the game and feel of the election campaign.

After 5 plays, I've won and lost as both Nixon and Kennedy.  I think that's a good sign.

RATING: 4.8
Yes, it does take 1.5-2 hours, but it really isn't that complicated.  It does seem to have a lot in common with CC:E in that you tend to hand on for a roller coaster ride due to the event cards.  They can cause pretty large swings with a single card.

I did enjoy it though.  It has a lot of historical information included in the cards.

For our first two games, he who ruled the issues ruled the game.  If the players balanced the issues a bit more I'm sure the game would have been a bit closer.

The only real strikes against it are:

My wife doesn't like the theme at all.
It's still just a large game of "tug-of-war" underneath, and I don't particularly enjoy that feeling.

Unfortunately after playing Twilight Struggle this game falls flat.  Hand management is barely required; it is too easy to just bury bad events and never to have to worry about them again.

The tug of war on the issues is a boaring mechanic that can dominate the game.  An experienced player can win by just spending his actions in the issues.  If the other player responds in kind, then the game is spent mainly going back and forth with an I add/ I take away back forth playing of cards.  If the other player does not respond, then he will find himself in a pit that he can never dig himself out of.

Also, some of the events are just not well balanced.  One that comes to mind is the late congressional session.  If played on the last turn, the Kennedy player might as well just pack up his game and go home.

These flaws make this game far inferior to Twilight Struggle.  I think that there was good potential in this game, it just did not quite achieve what it could have.

really enjoyed this after having learned Twilight Struggle and played Campaign Manager 2008. don't have a firm handle on the various levers, but our game was reasonably close - it all came down to California, and Nixon had an opportunity for 8 support checks there from election day events. I barely eked it out.

lesson learned from last game - don't leave things to chance. tried to mitigate endorsements and got burned. could have flipped a state with "Swing State" that would have won the game, but left it because i had election day support checks in that state.

Played this for the first time with my wife. We didn't know too much what to expect for the first game and it looked a little complicated to the both of us but it turned out great. Both of us enjoyed the game quite a bit and liked seeing how it all turned it.

One of the things I liked about the game was deciding how to spend your turns and where you'd campaign and what states you'd focus on. Getting endorsements helped me win a lot of the states in the South during the last turn by just removing my wife's support from them. Another thing we liked was how card's could be played multiple ways and how you had to decide how to play it  and when. It was especially nervous when playing a card that could help your opponent and hoping they don't activate the card.

This feels very similar to Twilight Struggle (and it should be based on the same engine).  There are things I like and dislike about this version as compared to Twilight Struggle.  

The components are so much nicer in this version (my only complaint about TS), but I do not like the event deck as much in this version.  The deck has just about as many cards as turns in the game so there no incentive to keep cards around for later.  The debates are a fun addition to the game however, and I want a copy of this game just to play it around election time.

Better components than Twilight Struggle, but the gameplay isn't as compelling.  There seem to be fewer DIFFICULT choices.  Because of the open nature of laying campaign influence you actually have more options per turn, but at any given point in time most are obviously inferior choices.  Depending on how the cards deal out momentum markers (and thus, the issues subgame) can be very important or an almost non-factor.  Generally, the game just lacks the urgency that adds to the tension and fun of Twilight Struggle.

While it seems a bit weak compared to its sibling Twilight Struggle, this is still one of the best game releases of 2007 in my opinion.

After 4 plays, I think I have the correct picture.  Luck in cards basically determines the gameplay and the winner.  It's suuch a shame, because I like the theme and events on cards has such educational aspect and the whole design is really ambitious...  Unfortunately it's more of an experience than a competitive game.  Pity.

[sidenote: my greatest fear - that the battles are fought over only the biggest states (with many electoral votes) - turned out to be completely false.  At least that's good..]

A sprawling, chaotic card driven area control game. Lots of tokens and fiddly bits albeit aesthetically pleasing and smartly designed. It was difficult seeing the big picture but at the end the mechanics melded together beautifully to create a natural story solely through gameplay. Some issues with how initiative works lead to the second player having an advantage in the final election. 

Looking forward to diving deeper.

I enjoyed reading the cards and discovering a bit more about the history of the election.  This game was quite different from anything else I had played before and I enjoyed it quite a bit the first few times I played.

Unfortunately, there are a few problems with this game that pretty much ensure that I won't play it again.  The issues are far too important and sometimes an entire round is spent just battling over issues.  The media doesn't come into play enough and feels like an afterthought.  The debates seem abstracted from the rest of the game.  Also, although interesting for a while, the theme just doesn't grab me.

It's ok -- definitely it's no Twilight Struggle. I think what may be the difference is that the geography / topology doesn't have the same impact. The "gaining momentum" cards don't have anywhere near the same impact as the scoring cards in TS. The debates are interesting, but they too don't offer enough tension. I think that's what's missing for me here, is the tension.

Never gotten a game in under 90 minutes. In fact,  not even close. But I don't care, I really enjoy this game win or lose. Love the theme and the plethora of  difficult decisions to make all the way though the game. Gets better as you become more familiar with the cards and how they affect the game. Perhaps not as good as Twilight Struggle when comparing similiar games, but it's not as long and honestly TS is almost as good as it gets. One of my favorites.

CDG about one of the most famous US elections in recent times. The game system is very similar to Twilight Struggle that you can use the cards for either events or points. And of course these card events bring out the flavor and memorable moments in the election. The different electoral college votes naturally made certain states into hotly contested areas which in my opinion where this game really shined. Players trade blows in these states and it feels like real game of political tug of war. The debate part of the game can get quite confusing as it is essentially a totally different system than the rest of the game. 

I rate this slightly lower than TS purely because the American political system is so foreign to me but I can see it being a better game than TS for some.

There are other games I like more, because they are a bit meatier, but beacuse this one is so accessible, and because the missus loves the theme too, this one is going to hit the table a lot.

I have only played this once but really really liked it.  I know a bit about the 1960 election and this game evoked its theme very well.  Since it's a) two-player and b) about an election, it won't be a game that gets played a lot, but when I have the time and a willing partner, this will be the first suggestion.

Good game, but not great.  It's a little too watered-down after playing Twilight Struggle 20+ times.  With experienced opponents, I'd almost always opt for TS instead.  However, I can see this being a good light alternative, where player experience isn't as much of an advantage.

Upped to 7.5 -- it has its place.  It's no Twilight Struggle, but it's not supposed to be.

This game gets a half a point because its a heavier 2 player that my wife enjoys.  In fact I can't seem to beat her, but the challenge of trying to figure out how is fun to me.  I like political games because I hate politics.  That may seem a contradiction but political games seem to be the essence of politics for me, a game that is more about winning than anything else.

This game is quite similar to Twilight Struggle on many aspects, obviously. It's not as strategic and deep as that game, however, especially since the events are much more powerful and often have no prerequisites. However, I still find it has a few interesting qualities that TS lacks. The playtime is much more consistent (and shorter!), it's more approachable, and it lacks many of the frustrating (or even sometimes infuriating!) aspects of that game (such as the randomness of the coups, the scoring cards and the "Wargames" card).

This is an amazing game--maybe the best 2-player game out there.  This game is easy to explain to new players, plays quickly, and is incredibly well balanced.  It uses a card driven system like Twilight Struggle or Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage, but 1960's momentum markers set this game over the others.  This is a fun game and it captures its theme perfectly.

Play with all three variants:
1.  CPs spent on the Issues cannot be spent on the Issue icon on the bottom of the card.
2.  Whichever player has Advertising support in the most REGIONS, may switch the position of two adjacent Issues on the Issue track, BEFORE the Issues bonuses are resolved.  If there is a tie in regional Advertising support, there is no pre-bonus switching.  The player with the most total Advertising SUPPORT may still rearrange the positions of the Issue track AFTER the Issue bonuses are resolved.
3.  The threshold for Carrying a state is reduced from 4 cubes to 3 cubes.

What a surprise!!! Really good game (way better than Campaign Manager). After I played Twilight Struggle, a game that didn't grab me, I didn´t want to try 1960 but I really liked it.  It makes me want to try TS again to see what I missed the first time.

It's been a long time since my only play of 1960: The Making of the President, so I don't remember much other than I had lots of fun playing it. 

For now I want to play the game again and when I do I will come back and re comment. I'm downgrading its rating so it matches my feelings for the game with the BGG rating system. Still I consider the game a good one.

RATING: 5
Extremely interesting theme to me.  

Two distinct phases combine Twilight Struggle hand management pre-debate with more aggressive card play post-debate (since one can bury opponent symbols with more impunity if they are an appropriate state).

Randomness makes the game more replayable, but since the entire deck is generally used, the randomness is in when cards are played (and by whom), not whether they are played.  It's more of a balanced chaos and emblematic of how I feel randomness should be used in games -- not as a club to hand victory to one player, but as a game element to be managed along with other game elements like resources.

Two sides have distinctly different characters, but are balanced against each other.

August 2012 - I really hate the debate mechanic.  I hated it back four years ago too but I'm less willing to overlook it now.

RATING: 7
1960: The Making of the President takes the card driven system in Twilight Struggle and paints a political theme over it. the game is set in 1960 (duh) and features the presidential (duh) election between John F. Kennedy and Richard M. Nixon, where one man will be made (duh) president, while the other will become president another time (maybe in 1969?).

Similar to Twilight Struggle, the game uses cards that can be used as either Events or Campaign Points. The game does not contain a 'sudden death' mechanic ala Twilight Struggle, but instead has a fixed endpoint, which is the presidential election itself.

While I may have only played one game (so far), 1960 feels less tense and less unpredictable compared to Twilight Struggle. The theme is also less tense (no DEFCON) and the plays feel less punishing. Ultimately, it depends on the level of intensity that you want in your 2-player gaming sessions.

I like this one a lot. Still only have a few plays under the belt, but when the wife and I want to play something that takes a few hours and has some meat, we go with this one. I also made a soundtrack of clips from the 1960 debate mixed in with Billboard top hits from 1960. Fun fun.

For the time investment there is a fair amount of luck involved.  Honestly though that didn't bother me that much.  This is a game I'll play for the experience/theme over my competative spirt. I'm sure this would be a real treat for those who were alive during this election.  I was not but still found it interesting.  I would recommend trying to play this before you buy it...if you came across it cheaply probably worth pulling the trigger.  Sadly, it appears the game has gone out of print and it's price point is starting to escalate.

There's a LOT going on in this game with how to best play the cards you got.

Lots of great bits in the game and the production value is very high.

Good two player card-driven game.  The only reason it's not an 8 is because of the longer play time and constant back-to-back take that.  I prefer my 2p games to be under an hour.  In my few games, you simply react to what the other player dose - you don't really develop a game plan.

After a number of plays, 1960 hasn't lit my fire the way Twilight Struggle did.  I love the theme, but I think there may be one too few impulse in each action round; the rounds always seem to end just as things are getting interesting.  I'm also not a fan of the debate system, which feels like the weakest part of the game.  It isn't particularly fun or strategic.  1960 feels very close to a great game, but just misses the mark for my friends and I.

RATING: 8
This combines a lot of the fun & tensions of Twilight Struggle with a lot new elements very specific to an election, all in 1/2 the time of Twilight Struggle.  One of the reasons I like Twilight Struggle is how the game recreates the paranoia and mindset of the Cold War.  This game does the same thing for a Presidential Election, desperation at being pulled in so many directions, taking your eye off of the issues to focus on a particular state, the cost of criss-crossing the country.  OK, I've never actually run for President, so I can't say it feels 100% accurate, but it is how I imagine it would feel.  Bravo on a sophomore effort from Jason and a freshman effort from Christian (both of whom I met at the 2007 WBC, and seemed very nice).  EDIT: After 3 plays my opinion of the game has only risen.  I'm having a hard time determining which is better, TS or 1960.  While clearly related, they are very different games.  The production values of the game are superb, IMnsHO.  I've heard people complain about the tit-for-tat aspect, and the "just wait for the right events to drop in you lap" strategy, but I haven't found either of those things in my handful of plays.

RATING: 6
A decent game borrowing concepts from the designer's previous game Twilight Struggle. Card play requires decisions about how to maximize effects--do you play actions or spend Campaign Points to shore up states, advance the issues, etc. One of the major weaknesses is the Debate Turn. It feels really clunky, is difficult to explain, and seems overwrought for not enough reward--most times you are only going to net a +2 or +3 cube gain over your opponent. 

Momentum is arguably more useful just for its threat than for actually expending it. Players have to juggle their card sequence to negate the possible impact of opponents triggering events. 

There's a lot that will resonate with political junkies and enough meat to keep coming back to play periodically. I've taught this to a couple different people and they enjoyed it. But it's hard to escape the feeling that it's mostly a tit-for-tat battle over the 4 or 5 states with the biggest electoral vote values. 

The game is lavishly produced and a real pleasure to behold when all laid out and set up.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I'm really enjoying my playings of this so far. I like that the game play is in rounds. By this I mean that cards cannot be carried forward into future rounds. You are always looking to make your best current move and don't have to think about holding onto a card in the hopes that it will be more effective later.

The game play is interesting and moves along at a good pace once the players are familiar with what they can do. The games I've played have been close and you could see where a move here or there could have made the difference.

RATING: 7
I can't help but compare this game to Twilight Struggle, a game I have mixed feelings about. TS's scoring is by arbitrary card draw and leads to over-focusing in a scoring region and then under-focusing in that same region after the card has been played. 1960 does not score until game's end and every region scores at the same time. This gives 1960 a much better arc than its predecessor, demonstrates an appreciation for the entire sphere of influences, and is an overall more satisfying game experience. It may be less complex than TS, but the mechanics make a lot more sense, both in game terms and thematically as well. 

My only concern is how well this game would hold up to repeated play. I do think TS has a significant edge over 1960 in the replayability department.

UPDATE: Sure enough, the replayability was slim. Traded 1960 while I still have TS. Go figure.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I like the cubes-and-bag system for taking areas, but the tension of playing cards is very small compared to other card driven games: you don't have to take care of the non discarded cards as they won't came back again, and usually the rival events are irrelevant in so far as they can not be played.

Estéticamente es muy bonito, con un mapa muy grande, unas cartas de buen tamaño y desplegado en mesa queda muy bien. En cuanto a la mecánica de juego, es muy fácil de aprender, y tras un par de turnos ya se tiene claro cómo funciona el juego.

El principal problema para jugar a este juego, es el de todos los card-driven, conocerse las cartas, ya que puedes saber qué eventos que quedan pueden salir y poder planificarte un poco mejor (aunque no se llegan a poner en juego todas las cartas).

Saber expandirse por los territorios, y atacar al otro en su propio campo son claves para la victoria.

Very beatyful game, with a big map, good cards and good looking once it is on the table. It is very easy to learn, you will know how it works in a few turns.

The main problem is, as in every CGD, to know the cards. It is very good to know which are the events still unplayed to plan a good strategy.

Learning how to expand your influence in the map, and how to attack your oponent keeping safe your territories are good points in a way to a victory.

While I really enjoyed 1960 at the beginning, I'm finding I prefer Matthews Twilight Struggle and 1989. Where the others feel quite a bit more tense throughout, 1960 is more a slow burner and while not necessarily bad, I find it falls into a tit-for-tat rut more often than the others.

Only played about five or six times in a year and a half, like the theme of the game, don't think it's as well designed or developed as Twilight Struggle, however.  The debates don't seem to work that well, there is less incentive to waste actions moving your candidate pawn to different regions when there are cards that will accomplish the same objectives, and -- most of the time -- the strategy and tactics are fairly clearcut.  Looking forward, however, to the multiplayer "Founding Fathers" by the same two game designers.

Has the continual struggle that I love in a game.

RATING: 3
Consistently irritating, win lose or draw. This is a game I would refuse to play under most circumstances. 

The gameplay falls flat on its face for a simple reason: influence is zero-sum / tit-for-tat. Entire turns can be flushed down the toilet undoing and re-doing identical moves. It is utterly tedious. Beyond that, there are three secondary failings. First, the "debates" are poorly integrated. You're supposed to save up your good cards (thematically) for them, but in practice, you just pitch your bad cards, because the rewards of winning the debates pale in comparison to the rewards for pitching the worst of your opponent's events (and deliberately losing the debates as a result). Second, there's no scoring at all until the end, which just intensifies the slogging it takes to get there. I don't even see this as terribly thematic. Mr. Matthews says it makes the game more strategic and less tactical, and I admire that in theory, but to my eyes the zero-sum nature of influence heavily undermines the potential for long-term play. Third, the events are about as subtle as a sledgehammer, and unexciting to boot. They don't give you interesting choices, and they don't create interesting effects within the game.

RATING: 8
This game is easy to draw comparisons to Twilight Struggle.  I guess with the shared designer that is becomes a natural comparison.  The game is lighter than Twilight Stuggle and it feels like a gateway to card driven wargames that would appeal to individuals that are usually not interested in this group of games.  I enjoyed the desicions that need to be made with the cards during the game.  The theme makes this game engaging and I always feel like I am enjoying this game even when I am loosing the election in a landslide.  I would highly recommend this game.

This is a great two player game, if you want to less tension than Twilight Struggle, but like the idea of TS.  I prefer TS, but am happy to own this b/c I feel it's more spouse friendly.  

5/1/2010:  i've downgraded it from 8 to 6.5 now that i've given TS a real workout in the last couple months.  TS is superior in every way, and not really all that much tougher for n00bs to pick up than 1960.  key states look like tugs of war in this game, the restrictions are gotten around too easily (control superceded by ads, mobility doesn't matter b/c you concentrate on one or two areas).  finally i don't like that there's just one scoring and that it's a bit hidden.  it makes for either a) calculators throughout the game, which doesn't work if you're trying to sell it to non-gamers or b) educated guesses about your status, which is just lame.

I am a big fan of Twilight Struggle (although it is hard to get to the table since it is a 2 player game) so I was very eager to Jason's new game.

EDIT 3/2/08:  After playing more, it lacks the extreme tension of TS, and is the worse for it.  It's OK, but seems to bumble about before reaching an elaborate finish.

Cons: if anything, its length and its two-playerness work against it, as it's not going to get to the table as often as shorter multiplayers, but that's like dissing the Mona Lisa for being a portrait instead of a landscape.

Update: I still like it a lot, but I'm not sure about the long-term sustainability of it owing to what I feel is a too-small deck.

I got this game mainly because I liked the election theme (introduced with Die Macher) and wanted a more accessible election themed game.  It seems to be more luck based than I would like, but I need a few more plays to see what strategies can be developed.

I love this game.  My wife doesn't like it so much.  There is too much direct conflict for her.  I think the strategy of the game is just really well designed. The board and pieces are beautiful and high quality.  The history is interesting, which is the part my wife likes the best.  And I love changing history. My wife's lack of enthusiasm drops its rating down a bit.

This copy is like new since we have only played it 3 times.

I'm a sucker for election games, and this is really dripping with theme.

Would give a 9, but there's a couple of problems: the ridiculously overpowered issue track and the dominance of the last turn's card draws. There's a class of cards that are strong at any other time, but ridiculously good when received on the last turn.

Very favorable initial impression.  I like the play time, which I anticipate would come down with further play.  I really like the theme, and the graphic design is pleasing.  The gameplay feels similar to Twilight Struggle, and it's fun to try and make the best of what you are dealt.  Ultimately the luck of the draw plays a huge role, but I'm convinced that skilled players can overcome it in most cases.  I would really like to try to explore different strategies.  Election games are probably the biggest untapped mine of game ideas - I would love to see some more.

Update: After a couple more plays, I can say with authority that one must not ignore the issues.  It's just a little box over in the corner, but the endorsements are huge.  In fact, I'm not sure how to actually play the game now.  If my opponent was just focusing on the issues, I don't see how I can do anything else other than also concentrate there until our attention goes elsewhere.

Update: After playing Campaign Manager 2008, I have to downgrade 1960, as I enjoy CM2008 more.  It's shorter, less frustrating and repetitive (you add two cubes, I remove them), and the election is easier to relate to.

A tug-of-war game about the most (famous?) American election. The game is pretty hard to rate because players can't tell how well they are doing throughout the game. Its almost like watching a story unfold which you have no control over. You play the cards and let the events take shape.

I am not convinced that there is much skillful play involved (aside from the timing of cards), but it is enjoyable to watch the election play out. The debates felt very out of place, almost like blind bidding for an auction. That aside, the game is definitely an improvement over Twilight Struggle.

Analyse the games components independently and it seems fairly boring, nondescript and passe. Include the fact that the production is fantastic, the cards have wonderful pictures and flavour text, the see-sawing game state, the almost balanced play and the tensions caused by countign uip votes at the end and this really shines as a great gaming experience. There are decisions to make and at the end of the game you can often point to a couple that may have swung the game. Really a great game and I'm so pleased I bought it.

This is a good game - I am glad I played it once to see its excellent design. It is just in a style that does not appeal to me. The decisions are slow because it takes so long for each player to read the cards and make appropriate decisions.

Another great 2 player CDG with theme and history.  I'm concerned the rating will go down b/c I think I have found a weakness in the game that I hope to disprove: if someone blitzes the issues they will either certainly win (dominate card events, momentum, endorsements) or the game will degrede into continued back and forth on issues w/o much focus on campaigning.  If so my rating could plummet.

RATING: 7
It's a less rulesy version of Twilight Struggle, with a lot of the same mechanics and so much simpler that it takes about two hours fewer to play and far less time to explain. What it loses in richness from TS it more than gains in smoothness. Card draws can affect play quite a bit and it's easy to underestimate the importance of Momentum tiles (I kept thinking of the strategic initiative tiles in Europe Engulfed...). I hear y'all who think the results of the debates can be a little arbitrary, but the cube swings actually aren't that bad; nine at most. Overall, this is an in-depth (and much-needed!) representation of US electoral politics that I'll be playing again and again. (How odd that nothing's ever filled the niche all that well until now, despite the gaminess built into the Constitution.) I can definitely see explaining this to a fairly handy gamer and playing twice in an evening.

Also, Z-Man deserves a lot of credit for putting together such gorgeous parts. The state seals are perfect, the board is legible, and the cards are substantial and well-designed, with excellent photos. No more "Chili!"

[After 4 plays: this game is fantastic. There are some warts, and they're not necessarily easy to iron out, but it's still a superb game.]

[After 9 plays: Now that I've been through this a few times, I spend most of every game sitting in New York and Pennsylvania, with occasional forays to California, Texas and Ohio. It's a bit of a problem with the design... and American politics, really.]

good game. IMHO, not as good as a couple of other election games - "The next President" or "Election X - or just Election". Also, not as good as the prior design by Jason - Twilight Struggle.

This game has what I would call 'useless' pieces - the state tokens are cute, but I would much rather have a sheet with the state by region and the number of votes that you can check off and add up. I really dont quite get what the state tokens are for.

I like playing this once in awhile.  I enjoy the theme and the integration of the theme with game play.

RATING: 7
Nicely dense card mechanics - each card can either be played to manipulate the gamestate, banked for its corner value to spend in later phases, or discarded to generate action points (with your opponent being given the option to pay to trigger its text effect anyway). Good gameplay and a nice history lesson, but the endgame feels unsatisfying, with the victor being unclear until all the fiddly counting-up is done.

I love playing this with my Dad, a genuine JFK junkie and former state representative for Rhode Island. I feel like this game really brings the historical flavor to life, as well as being both challenging and fun to play. The only downside is the "swing-y" nature of the way the states work -- you often find yourself taking over a state, only to find your opponent to swing back and take it back a turn or two later.

RATING: 9
The weakest part of this game is probably the theme, which I think is just fantastic, but will probably seem dry and uninteresting to many gamers. So I give the game an additional point just for historic nostalgia.  The game itself is simply fabulous.  A stylistic descendant of Twilight Struggle, one might say this game is a streamlined version of TS.  In any case, game play is interesting and tense; the rules are clear and concise; and the game plays in about two hours or less.  The design really does hit on all cylinders.  Highly recommended.

CRITIQUE OF 1960
I bought 1960 because I had been playing a lot of Labyrinth and Twilight Struggle, and I wanted more of the same. But while 1960 shares a designer with TS, the two games are very different.

In TS, the tension not only comes from having to play cards that are good for your opponent (trying to minimize the damage you do to yourself is a huge part of the game), but also from having to choose between using a card for its ops or for its event. And why that's a tough call is because the difference between the two often comes down to a single point one way or the other.

But when I played 1960, I felt none of that tension. The events on the cards were always significantly better than using the card for ops, so the game came down to who got the better cards at the right time. 1960 isn't nearly as strategic as TS, and failing to be deeply strategic it also fails at replicating the tension of that famous presidential election.

I love the components; the graphic design of the game is solid and everything is well made. Also, the theme and the history lesson is very well done! People these days would probably be shocked to learn that the southern states were mostly "blue" when people voted their social and economic interests (i.e., before the Republicans flipped these states by appealing to Southerners' historical racist and religious fundamentalist leanings).

But honestly, after a few plays I couldn't bring myself to keep this game on my shelf. I bought it because I loved the decision-making process in card driven games like Labyrinth and Twilight Struggle, and that process is simply lacking here. I've seen 1960 referred to as "Twilight Struggle Lite," but it's not. Very little of what makes TS so satisfying is present in this game.

A lighter Twilight Struggle, but it was sure fun trying to capture electoral votes. I can see this getting to the table more frequently than Twilight. It is easy to learn and teach. I may be a little biased because I love historical games, whereas Twilight gets really tense, this game seemed to be providing the laugh factor with a good balance of medium weight strategy. Can be a little hard to keep track of who's winning during game so I recommend a pair of calculators while playing to keep track of the numbers.

a variation/re-theme of twilight struggle, not as brilliant though. it's less tense and doesn't have that much ruthless cut-throat action, besides there's no 'sudden death' mechanism which enables one of the players to win before time runs out - but this is due to the nature of presidential campaign. it makes the game longer, 3 hours easily. it's worth mentioning that the debate mechanic is somewhat dissappointing, it should be a more critical event in the campaign. overall it's a very, very good game, definitely worth having.

RATING: 8
Very early rating after a game until the debates.

Alain was leading heavily as Nixon because I screwed up in the debates. (having not selected any economic cards)
I thought I screwed up. alain had only a kennedy card for the economic issue. So I would win that. 


I however had 3 issue markers on defense and one on the others. 4 Momentum markers at the start of round 7; alain none (the card that gave you an equal amount was allready played)
Double endorsements in the east and west endorsements and a single one in the south.; alain none 
Had a 3/2 ratio of cubes in the bag.
HAd the 5 support check on Illinois on the table and had drawn that state to make 8 support checks, Alain was holding that state however with three cubes so still needed a fight.

So I think we were in for a spectacular finish.

However since we didn't play the game before, explanation took a while and the first couple of turns were pretty slow. After that it picked up some speed.

And I was under the impression issuemakers would benefit me in the debates but apparently they don't.
Nixon got a lot of good cards and because we finished the game early (because Alain was late allready) I had a look at the draw pile. and there were only a couple of Nixon cards left and more than half of the cards were Kennedy only cards.

So first game took over three hours to the start of round 7.  for two players who hadn't play a card driven game like this before and only one of them was familiar with the rules.

Rating would have been a 7 until that point. Interesting decisions to make and the cards you play could put you back. 
A gave it a half point more as I was expecting a grand finale to the game.
If the grand finale is a fact and I believe it is rating is at least an 8.

I wanted to love this so badly, but both games played resulted in an endless tug of war, drawn out repetitive rounds and mechanics making no sense at all.

This is not Twilight Struggle, but it is an excellent introduction to the card-driven genre.

I can't really see what the big deal is.  It is tug-of-war with a random power of 2, 3, or 4.  I add a cube, you take a cube away, etc, etc, for two solid hours.  Maybe you have to really be into the theme.

The cards, on the other hand, are excellent.  They use old newspaper headlines, with what appears to be actual photographs of what the card is referring to.  I had much more fun going through the deck and reading the cards while I was learning the rules than actually playing the game.

Looking good and the mechanics seem to be well integrated into the theme, but as many others have also noted, just playing plain campaign actions to push more and more cubes into the few key states, and playing the stronger events overrides all the other actions and features.

[2008.Mar.09] A visually stunning design produced by Z-Man Games, however, after a few plays the game appears to lack the staying power of its predecessor, Twilight Struggle (TS). With only one deck (as opposed to separated decks, like in TS) and no opportunity to re-shuffle (and thus, re-draw/re-encounter cards), the event cards are a little random in their appearance and one or two turns of 'bad' card draws may easily cost you the game. Additionally, the game eventually devolves into the same arm-wrestling contest centered around a handful of large (electoral college-wise) States. ("I put cubes there, and then you take them off; rinse and repeat.") In the end, 1960 removes some of the elements that I didn't like in TS, but unfortunately also removes many the elements that I did like.

Played twice.  Better than Twilight Struggle, but that's not saying much.  Pretty decent game, but suffers in the same way TS does - do I hurt me or help you?  That gets old.  But, it's faster, and not quite as unbalanced as TS.  I'd play again.

I prefer Twilight Struggle over 1960 but if you are looking to play a similar styled game in less than half the time, this is your game.  After my first play, I'm not certain how much value the endorsements provide, but that may just be because of our style of play the first time.  Using momentum to allow you to either use your own events on cards played by others is an interesting twist as is the cubes in the bag for drawing for influence in states where the other person has 4 cubes or their candidate.  The player aid on the back page of the instructions is well done and the instructions are laid out clearly and concisely.  I would have preferred that more cubes were included as I ran out of cubes quite often in the later rounds, but this appears to generally only happen when one person is playing poorly or has had considerable misfortune.  Its a fun game, but I do question the replayability factor of this game compared to the more extensive Twilight Struggle which feels much more or a life and death struggle.  This game seems to quickly devolve into 1-3 battleground states where most of the attention gets focused thus far.

After more plays of Twilight Struggle, I've concluded that I would just prefer to play TS over 1960.  1960 is a fine game that may be more user friendly, but it just doesn't carry the same delightful tension of card to card play that TS provides.

This truly belongs to the best political games out there and represents a fascinating exercise in American politics. Another wonderful implementation of the card driven mechanic (see, e.g., Hannibal: Rome vs Carthage or Twilight Struggle). It manages to create the atmosphere and tension of an ongoing campaign (never run a campaign myself, of course, but it does meet my idea of how it could be like).
Everything seems to fall into its place, with tough decisions on whether to invest influence into media, into campaigning states or into the candidates profile regarding three issues (Civil Rights, Defense, and Finance). Although I really like 1960, I have to confess that, for some reason I cannot pinpoint, I would most of the times prefer Twilight Struggle.

A really interesting tactical game. It really feels as if you are reliving the 1960 presidential race, and that is a very cool thing. I definitely enjoyed the tough choices that play the Campaign cards presents you each turn, and the graphic design for the game is nearly flawless. The one complaint I have about the game is that the debate round feels somewhat tacked on, but the last days of campaigning does feel pretty well integrated between theme and mechanics. I would definitely love to play more of this one.

Excellent game that recreates a fascinating period in American history.  The game is very well designed and every move has advantages and trade-offs.  Z-Man has given the game top drawer production values as well. This game incorporates the historical feel and attention to theme of a wargame with the ease of play and tense decisions of a Euro.

Gift from my 2006 secret Santa victim, grandslam.  Craig and I played, first time for both of us, after ringing in 2008.  I won as Kennedy by a fair margin, don't remember the exact score since it was about 4:00 a.m. when we finished.  Excellent game with difficult choices but a bit of luck thrown in via card draw, initiative, and support checks to add lots of excitement.  I think I prefer it a bit to Twilight Struggle because control is cleaner with only allowing one player to occupy states and there are options to play or not play events based on momentum tokens.  Also like the (generally) shorter playing time.  Look forward to the next play!

A topic I always want to know more. 1960: The Making of the President...after Obama was in office for 2 years, I finally got a chance to play this game which was bought about when Obama was sworn into office. Easy to set up and gameplay flows smoothly with a simpler mechanics than Twilight Struggle, if only it was because I was familiar with the designer's intent. The story rolled out quite naturally with the cards and the text and the game has a stronger story-telling ability. The game balance was very close, more than I expected initially. The game was won only in the last turn when attacks made at New York could have swung the whole thing from the Democrats to the Republicans. However, I still felt the game was slightly in favor of Kennedy. Maybe that advantage would be dissipated after more plays. Final game result was Kennedy 312 vs. Nixon 225. Both NY and PA are critical states and I suspect they have to be taken in any game in order to claim a victory. So despite definitely 1960: The Making of the President is a good game, I am not sure if the game can be somehow different and if other lesser states can make the difference. It might be true to history and reality. In game terms, it might also mean restricted variability for repeated play. I need more plays other than anything else to confirm such observation though.

It s a very well designed, ver smooth election game. The cards are meaningful and impactful. All factors affecting an election campaign are genuinely identified and integrated with the three major national issues. An admirable game.

RATING: 7
Simple enough to allow players to make difficult and meaningful decisions on their first play.  Deep enough to be enjoyed more and more beyond the first play (as one gets a better knowledge of the interplay between the different mechanisms, and of what cards are found in the deck).  However, the game beginning is not as tense as the beginning in Schotten-Totten, or Samurai: there are many possibilities open (the situation becomes tighter towards the end).

The theme is very well reflected in the mechanics.  This makes the game more enjoyable (for instance, the cubes you get when playing certain Events do make sense), and also gives a lesson in history (and an appreciation of how difficult campaigning is).

Very good quality bits: very thick cardboard, printing nicely centered, sturdy cards.

Two-thirds of one play. 

Initially the game reminded me of reading a high school history book. In some ways this is good as the cards have a lot of flavor text, but mostly this is bad as high school history books are the best cure for insomnia that I know of.

Fast forward to the present and the game is afoot. Nixon (me) is losing. Not badly, but losing nonetheless. He decides to capture the East, specifically New York which appears to be the decider in many of the session reports on BGG. To do this, he is crafty. He gains and loses media control over a few turns until there are two media support in the East, which makes it more difficult to remove Nixon's support. Nixon continues by campaigning heavily in New York, carrying the state with 5 state support. Finally he camps out there. Any ONE of these things should make life difficult for Kennedy as support checks are now required to campaign in NY. Or so it was thought.

Two Kennedy events later, state support is destroyed without a single support check. Then something happened that has never happened in a presidential race - Nixon quit. Yep, a first for me but the game made me so mad that I quit. If all the work of many turns could be wiped out with two cards, I don't feel the game is worth playing.

In short, I knew the events were powerful, but I did not realize how devastating a good hand of events is versus a bad hand. Campaigning was a complete waste of time compared to good events. So I am not impressed.

On a positive note, this game has one of the best boards I have ever seen!

RATING: 9
The game was pretty fun---I was worried about the  conflict, but it turned out we were okay with it.  When this type of tug-of-war conflict is [i]expected[/i] in the game, it doesn't feel as nasty and mean as when it appears more "optional".  The hand management and cardplay aspect was right up our alley.  Another reason the game didn't feel quite as nasty is that you always have something you can do with your cards, even if you have a fairly bad hand---you can play them as events or play them for points.  You then have to decide whether to play the points as campaign actions in states, on the issues, and on the media.  In fact, there's a huge amount of angst over how you should play your cards, which is the kind of tension we like.   You never feel locked out, which makes it a little more newbie friendly than [GAMEID=12333], where sometimes you're forced to play unfavorable events.  The way all of the aspects interlock together as checks and balances works fairly well (although we still haven't really gotten a good handle on preparing for the debates).

Still, the game was a success and we enjoyed it. It feels like a good introduction to card driven games, and she was even won over the election theme and learning some neat historical facts. The game length is right around how long we like it (~90 min), so it may be a while before we move into the significantly longer Twilight Struggle neighborhood, but I'm hopeful...

Played it once this weekend and was not disapointed. Seems like a Twilight Struggle "light", but really isn't as the complexity is about similar. The two are a enough alike that you grasp the concepts easily, but also different enough to warrant having both. Personally I think I prefer the theme in TS, but that is nitpicking.

One thing I would change is the tiebreaker mechanism in the debates. I would suggest that in case of a tie, the winner should be the leader on the issue. As the rule stands there isn't enough incentive to spend energy on leading an issue

Lost both plays as Kennedy, but both games were enjoyable. Mis-played some rules on the first try, We were only adding "rest cubes" to the bag when playing the CP value of the card, not when playing the Event, and mis-interpreted how the media coverage affects cube placement. 2nd try however was much better. Good game and interesting to see how things pan out.

A great shorter implementation of Twilight. I think it has a perfect theme as politics is really much akin to war.

Update:

Many have commented that this game is inferior to it's original due to some "tug of war" that occurs over given territories.

I'm confused why someone would allow themselves to be sucked into a fruitless contest such as this rather than focus efforts elsewhere. I'm of the opinion that this is an artifact of group think.

Excellent game, lots of interesting back and forth with much to consider in every turn.  I also liked how what is a fairly involved game was laid out in the rulebook, giving us no rule issues during the game.  There is some luck of the draw in the cards you get - getting good events for you, being able to bury bad ones or playing them for CP when your opponent is out of momentum.  But you see enough cards that your turn to get good cards will come and you have to make the best of the mess you find yourself in.  I lost by a long way but had a blast.

This is a pretty fun game.  A bit fiddly and there is ALOT going on.  I think the ratings will go up after several plays but the fact that it is a Card driven game you are going to have a difficult time playing if you don't know all the cards.

We will see how I like it at a later date.

RATING: 9
You are either Nixon or Kennedy in the 1960 Race for President.  You play cards that represent real events from the campaign and can be used for "campaign points" or as events.  Opponents can use the points to impact areas of the board to increase majorities in a state, affect the media or fight for control of issues.  Opposing players can use momentum to trigger events.  

A card each round is left for the debates.  Debates are fought over issues.  

In the end, the winner is determined by summing the electoral votes for each state like a real election.  

The game is brilliant, but in the end, much of the play centers on the fight over the issues.  I suppose that makes thematic sense, but the game can be "samey" after repeated plays.

My first impression is one of significant disappointment.  Certainly I had sky-high expectations for this game coming on the tail of Twilight Struggle.  Even so, the card play falls a little flat in that there is no deck reshuffling and somewhat less tension regarding events.  There are some nice touches, such as the debates, but overall not as good a game as TS.  On the upside the components are top-notch.

I played this at the first Dallas Games Marathon.  I thought all the interlocking rules worked well with each other.  The game is probably better balanced than Twilight Struggle.  To call this game Twilight Struggle light is a bit of a misnomer.  While it shares some of the same mechanics, it has a different feel to it.  It plays in under 2 hours, which means this game will see more table time at the local game group.  I can't wait till I can get this game on my table.  I am giving the game a rating of eight, but it will probably move up once if it shows consistent, enjoyable play after a few more outings.

A beautiful and very engaging game. I get so swept in by this title. It's usually a nailbiter down to the last minute with equal strength players, even if it feels you're running away with it you might be surprised when those electoral votes are tallied. Your opponent can pull some alarming stuff out of his hat, especially at the end. The best game of '07 with no doubt. My only quibble is there just aren't enough support cubes! The support cube issue has been resolved by Zman games generosity. Thanks Zev!

4/2011 It's been compared to Twilight Struggle; yes well, it's a card driven two player game by GMT and that's about where the comparison ends.  1960 seems a lot simpler: there's only one end game goal - the final election.  The card events seem powerful played and played more often;  the deck is unlikely to be reshuffled or perhaps only once.  And there is more randomness in the cards with little or no way to really protect area dominance.  Still, a good game with interesting well integrated theme.

A good, very playable simulation of a US election.

Feels realistic and there's lots of decisions.

However, compared to Twilight Struggle, this feels much more Euro, and is a little disappointing beauase of it.  The event cards lack variety and interest - they mostly just add or subtract cubes. Control swings gently back and forth, without the exciting combos and changes of fortune in TS.

Also, the cube bag idea, though a stunningly clever concept, is poorly implemented here and doesn't really work in this game.  The bag just gets fuller and fuller as too few things cause you to draw from it.  An odd flaw that must have been noticed in playtesting. I feel there are accolades aplenty awaiting the first person to incorporate this mechanism successfully into a game design.

I think better familiarity with the rules led to a runaway victory for the Kennedy player (me) the first time we played, and though I won the next game too, it felt like a tighter race.

I liked the mechanics enough that I went and bough Twilight Struggle and Paths of Glory.

The first thing I thought after playing the game was not "let's play this again" but "I'd like to play this game again but with a different setting."
Perfectly captures the atmosphere and theme, and makes for a fun, memorable gaming experience.  Terrific 2-players game.  One of those games worth playing at least once.  
Unfortunately its main strength is also its main weakness.  Although I enjoyed very much playing it the first time, I feel no desire to revisit that particular time in history.  It feels like having to watch the same movie again and I am not compelled enough to do so.  Hence the lower rating (would be much higher if it were a theme/setting I cared more about).

It's a card driven area majority. The cubes insteaed of the dice are nice (offering a bit more controlled luck), but the gameplay is quite repetitive, the decisions often aren't interesting  (events stronger than CPs, advertising is a waste of resources, etc.) and the theme is boring (maybe because I'm not American).

A tense tug of war and a nasty cat-fight.  Some aren't keen on the luck inherent in the game system, but I feel it's something that can be managed (if not totally overcome).

RATING: 4
This is a nicely presented game. I find American presidential politics very interesting (and I wrote that part of this comment *before* the 2016 election campaign).  The clash between Kennedy and Nixon is something that I knew of, but did not know much about.  This gave me an opportunity to learn a little more, in the context of a game.

Interestingly, the Australian Federal election in 1960 was perhaps even more of a cliffhanger than the US Presidential race - the conservatives are said to have been returned to government on the back of Communist Party preferences in the seat of Moreton - the conservative Prime Minister (Robert Menzies) having unsuccessfully attempted to ban the Communist Party five years earlier.  But that might be a topic for another day.

Anyway, nothing really to dislike about this game:  I like card driven games; I love politics and political history; the game looks and feels good.  (I am particularly fond of the mock coffee stains on the board).

I think the thing that brings me to rate it fairly low is that I prefer games with more direct conflict.  This has lots if indirect conflict.  What I am doing as I play is responding to moves my opponent has made, or making moves that force her or him to respond - setting up leads that need to be pulled back etc.  But we do not take each other on directly either in my turn or hers / his.

Undoubtedly that says more about me than it does about the game - but hence the low rating.

Only played one time. This was a fun CDG that is easily playable in one evening. The rules are very simple and the game can be learned in about 15 min. Further plays will help in that most of our time was spend reading each of the cards. With more plays I expect to learn the cards and be able to play faster.

I was really looking forward to playing this game, but it really didn't live up to my expectations.  I found the board position to be way too fluid.  You couldn't really build up a stronghold or make any strategic decisions about where to campaign because movement around the board was so easy--especially with events that let you place cubes everywhere.  I expect the topologic restrictions of Twilight Struggle make a more interesting game, but I don't play two-player games enough to have tried that one out yet.

Fantastic card-driven area control game similar to "Twilight Struggle" but maybe the luck factor is stronger here. Very enjoyable game!! Components are great and the rulebook is very detailed that leaves you with no questions. I never expected to like a game with a political theme so much!

RATING: 8.5
1960 was THE game to get in the latter half of 2007. Luckilly I got one for Christmas and I've had the opportunity to play it about 4 or 5 times now. 

Thematically the game does a fantastic job of immersing you into the politics of 1960. The components are all top notch and they contribute greatly to the feeling of running a major political campaign.

The rules are very simple and 1960 has one of the best rulebooks out there too. There are very few ambiguities and it has plenty of diagrams to make things as clear as possible. 

From a gameplay standpoint, it succeeds on nearly all levels. Think of it as a "Variable Action Point" game with an "Area Control" board. You never have enough resources or time to do what you'd like and there is a constant struggle to defend against what your opponent is doing verses attacking him when you have an opportunity. I'm still not certain that the concerns of "Issue Wars" isn't valid as most of my games have had some of that in them. I'll probably try the two simple fixes for Issues (may not place a cube on the issue that is depicted on the card you play) and Media (May arrange issues BEFORE awards), as the concerns of Issues being too powerful and Media being too weak ring true to me.

All in all, this is a fantastic game that I just want to keep playing. After 4 games or so, I've yet to win too.

Might be a good gateway game for people wanting to get into CDGs but what this does, TS and Labyrinth do better.  Innovative theme and great components but clunky mechanics such as the TV debate and never knowing if you're in the lead or not have me looking somewhere else most of the time.  I much prefer a system like Twilight Struggle's where scoring cards show up once or twice a turn and VPs go back and forth.  But it comes with the territory.  After all, with a real election, you don't know for sure until the end either...

Even the 6 rating might be a little generous. I enjoy some Card Driven Games (notably We The People), but haven't understood the amazingly positive reaction to this (and Twilight Struggle). Felt like a lot of churn (back & forth without much forward progress or change in outcome) to me. Perhaps that's how the American presidential campaign really works . . . in which case it's just a so-so topic for a game.

I really like this game.  I like the educational aspect as folks will learn about the US electoral process in general and about specific historic events via the cards.  More importantly, it plays real well.  Lots of choices, but it doesn't move too slowly.  The only downside is that the game can provoke emotional responses from opponents when you undo their carefully planned strategy in a matter of minutes.

Excellent majority game for two. Not as continuously tense as Twilight Struggle but much shorter. I also like the rest cubes concept where a less powerful card will allow you more rest cubes and therefore enhance your probabilities on initiative and support checks. Therefore there is less chance of a very bad or very good hand.

Christmas 2007.  First play I was Kennedy and daughter Nixon.  I got squashed.  About a two to one margin.  Hate the game so much I can't wait to play again.  Terrible, awful...  I will rate it either a 9 or 10.  Quality is best I've seen (hope Agricola follows this model).  I love the woven cards, they last forever without sleeving.

More plays and more fun.  Put aside for a bit as other games need time too!

Personally I dig the theme, though it might turn some people off. Lots of great decisions to be made throughout the game, very rarely (if at all) does it feel like there is a move you just "have to" make. I'm still not sold on the debates really being all that important beyond their history, I'd have preferred something like the space race in TS, where it's a nice thing to do and a way to bury cards in a crunch, but it's not this big showpiece either.

A masterpiece! I don't know where to start, really. 
I can easily say that this game provided more tension than any other game I've played, from start to finish. 

My favorite part about the game, and the driving force throughout, is the cards. They are fantastic. First of all, the names of many of them are hilarious (political jokes at the expense of either Kennedy or Nixon). They also include just a blurb of flavor text, which in this case is historical information (which is primarily anecdotal and interesting). Beyond that, the cards are mostly split into 2 parts. You can either initiate an event OR take action points. This decision alone can drive any player mad, at times. Plus, you have to consider whether you are going to prevent someone from blocking your event or if you want to copy someone else's. Perhaps most importantly, you have to play the cards in the right order to achieve the optimal effect. To be fair, this could potentially be an AP-inducing nightmare for some player. Even for me, someone who doesn't generally succumb to AP, I tend to have to take my time. But, it's so enjoyable, and this is where the game gets a lot of its tension! It's almost more fun to decide the order to play your cards than it is to actually play them, oddly enough. So, the cards are awesome. 

Beyond that, there's a great deal of chrome in the game: endorsements, advertising, major issues, momentum, etc. Consequently, there's a lot to think about, but it's not overwhelming, at least not for us. This isn't a gateway game! If you play this as a gateway, you might hate it, or think it feels like work. But that's just an assumption, I can't be sure.

Nevertheless, one of the greatest strengths of this game is the theme. I love how everything blends thematically: the tension, the back and forth, the debates, the campaign factors, and eventually, election day. The theme is well-implemented (granted I'm a history teacher). 

The components are also quite nice. The art is period-appropoiate and clean. I like the "rest cubes/coffee mug" mechanic. What's interesting, and also thematically appropriate to elections, is I was crushing my wife the whole game as Kennedy. But because of her disproportionate amount of support check cubes in the bag on election day, you was able to pull off an inconceivable victory. I couldn't believe I lost, and I was quite frustrated, but in a weird way (because it made so much sense thematically) I just couldn't help but like the game more because of it. I just love this game! I'm going to stop now!

RATING: 4
2 / 5 - Fair.

Some solid strategic decisions, especially around creative ordering of card play to maximise benefits. The cube-drawing mechanics is a really nice way of getting some random elements into the game while allowing players some strategic input into tilting the odds. However, and slightly bizarrely for such a relatively simple game, there's a bit too much pointless fluff (endorsements, advertising and other mechanics don't do an awful lot). It also lacks a little in the tension department - it's there at the end, but not through the rest of the game. The fact that most cards just shuffle cubes around makes them hard to differentiate and thus makes it more difficult to relate the game to its historical roots.

Lots of decisions, but surprisingly quick-playing. I finished my second game in under 2 hours. Had a similar feel to Twilight Struggle in that you feel constantly under pressure to accomplish six things when you can only do one. Seems like the key is not wasting too many CPs on movement and not over-valuing the debates.

In my games:

Kennedy - 3
Nixon - 2

I was hoping for a game that could offer a shorter Twilight Struggle experience, and while it did succeed on the shorter front, the overall gameplay was not that engaging for me.

What I liked:
- Opposing events aren't automatically triggered
- Shorter playtime

What I didn't like:
- There was too much back and forth on issues, and also on the big states, even when you carried.
- Drawing powerful cards in the last round before elections had a big impact on the end results
- Adding up all the electoral votes at the end

Good game but much prefer twilight struggle.  In TS, even in the crap turns there feels like something meaningful to push for.  1960 doesn't have the same tension, as there are plenty of turns where not much happens and seems to be much more subject to bad luck. I felt locked out of the momentum tokens due to constantly losing the initiative test (despite having more cubes in the bag), which effectively eliminated one element of the game for me. It was only very good luck on the final round cards which won it for me.

Plays shorter than TS, so easier to fit into a weeknight, but nowhere near as epic, and while the colours on the board aren't too bad for most of the game, it is hard to find the right States in the setup tokens end game cards - lots of obvious looking required for those of us not familiar with us geography.

Two plays in and I'm waffling between an 8 and a 9 for this one.

Comparison to Twilight Struggle is inevitable--right now I give Twilight Struggle the nod if only based on theme.  I loved the designer's notes on each card in Twilight Struggle and miss them in 1960.

After my first play I commented: 'Twilight Struggle also seemed more tense.  One reason for this may be the tug-of-war VP track in Twilight Struggle.  In 1960 you have to sum up electoral votes to see who's ahead at any given time, and my opponent and I just eyeballed it instead.  When a state switches to support your opponent's candidate, unless it's New York, California or Texas there just isn't that "oh crap" feel of a VP swing that you get when moving the counter in Twilight Struggle.'

On my second play I felt the tension ratcheting up.

5-1-2008: Apparently, we've been playing this wrong.  We've been allowing pre-empting of events when choosing to play a card as an event.  Rereading the rules makes it seem you can only pre-empt when someone chooses to play an event off an opponent's card when the opponent uses it for points.
8-23-2009: Purchased a bunch of small red and blue dice to use on the board instead of cubes.  Hopefully this makes the whole situation easier to look at at-a-glance.

I liked 1960: The Making of the President. Though like most card based games the luck of the draw is huge. I think its a well designed game; the elements all seem logical, historic, and realistic. Yet there are so many facets to consider its easy for a new player to be overwhelmed by options, and how the options relate to each other. Also, like many card games, knowledge of the card deck is very helpful. Therefore I can't see a newbie winning unless he just happens to draw exceptional cards. That doesn't make 1960 a bad game, but a prospective player should be aware of this.  

As to the graphics, they are generally very good. Though there should be some display to show which player currently has the initiative. Plus printing the state names in black on a blue strip across the top of some of the state's cube boxes was a poor choice. White on blue would have been *much* easier to read. All the photos on the cards seemed period except the Recount card's photo that is clearly from the 2000 election snafu in Florida (hanging chads). 

The stated play time of 90 minutes is ridiculous. I can't see even very experienced players finishing a game anywhere close to this. My first game on 10/27/12 took 2.8 hours.
04/20/13 Played a second game in 2.6 hours. 
10/12/13 Played a third game in 2.75 hours.

As with every Z-Man game, I'm really impressed by the quality of what you get. I love their boxes (though Imperial still has my favourite cover) because they're made of thick card and well-printed. The boards are some of the toughest and best-printed I've ever seen, and I really love the semi-matt finish on the maps which is classy. Though I was - and am - disappointed by Pandemic (I still can't understand what people love about this game, but each to their own. Maybe I just need competition), I think Traders of Carthage is great. Hence I wanted to try, and now I've bought this. Money well spent, even if the bits were a little mouldy. They soon cleaned up. Where the hell are Z-Man warehousing their games, a dungeon? 

Anyway, this is by far the best 2-player game I've played. At least, it suits my preference and style of play. That's not to say I like it because I win all the time - assuredly, I don't. But I think the reciprocating mechanic in card play - gain campaign points whilst risking your opponent activating an event you don't want, or activate a favourable event which might mean you take a hit somewhere else - makes for some tense and thrilling guessing games. And the fact that you're only playing one other person I find more exciting than, dare I say it, the multiplayer action in Imperial and many of the other games I own. In some ways, the chaos and unpredictability of multiplayer games means you don't feel so bad when you lose. If I'd only played the Eisenhower card there, though... and if I'd only kept a Civil Rights in my campaign stack... and one more momentum chip...

A future classic, and already one I know I'll play again and again. I guess Duel in the Dark is in my sights now.

Gone down a bit after a few plays.

Brilliant game.  Awesome game design.  Great educational value.  Loads of fun, tension and excitement.

A little tough to wade through all the rules with an impatient-to-get-started crowd, but extremely satisfying once in gear.  One of the best rulebooks ever written makes it easier, but still, there's just a lot of rules to explain.  Of course, it's the dimensional aspect of each game component that is somewhat complex, but ultimately it's all very logical once understood.

I actually delayed a complete explanation of the debate and election day mechanics until a couple of turns in (only giving top level guidance for what kind of card might work best in the debates).  Once they could experience how the cards basically played, it all started to click together for them.

Played with small teams for the first time, and it played very well (although taking much longer, of course. ~3 hours with rules explanation.)

Play is richer for an older crowd (due to familiarity to the current events of the time) but still very enjoyable for smart teens.

This one was a good stretch for my new gaming crew, and probably garnered the most lively after-game conversations.

9.5 may be a little high after so few plays, but I really enjoy this game. It has strategy, tactics and hundreds of cubes. The game is well produced, the rules easy to learn, teach and read (and the layout is fantastic). Misters Matthews and Leonhard really did the gaming community a service by designing this game. I never thought I'd like the theme, but really works somehow. I still want to play Twilight Struggle, but the playing time for this is way more preferable.

Update: keeps getting better as new strategies are realized. Now, just to get one of the people I taught to play again...

RATING: 8.5
Game in a Nutshell: Card driven competition over election year 1960, where several components (media, debates, campaigning, etc.) all play in tipping the scales for each state's electoral votes.

Played as: Two-player only.

Pros: Absolutely every turn is as important as the last. There will be no winning this game in the first 30 minutes of play, and chances are when it's all said and done, there's going to be a race that's so tight, it'll likely be decided by a few well placed cubes. The closeness of each contest of course is because of some nice built in mechanics that only allow the smallest of advantages to maybe slip through from round to round.

Cons: There is a small random factor that can make a big difference on election day when drawing cubes from the bag. The theme was an initial turnoff.

Other: This has that great combination of opponent interaction vs. hand management that I love so much in my favorite games. However, I'm worried that this game isn't quite as dynamic as others and will wear out faster due to a more structured progression of play. I was pleasantly surprised that the game, labeled with such a boring title, actually has very tight and exciting game-play.

Best Use: Right now it's the best two-player gamers game I've played.

A very good introductory game for the card-driven system.  Plays pretty fast, easy to explain, and some good drama.  Setup takes a bit of time, but the components are top-quality.  Another winner from Matthews.  Not as involving as Twilight Struggle, but for the more casual crowd a good pleaser.

Solid 2 player game. Played with my son (14 years old) and he enjoyed it. Game play improves as you become more familiar with the cards in the campaign deck. On the surface it's an nice area control game. You'll need to give this one a couple of plays before you start seeing the strategic and tactical nuances in the mechanics.

Short rule book, but fairly dense due to many concepts.  Very playable once you figure it out.  2 hours to play once you get the hang of it, takes longer at first.  Seems pretty balanced.  Lots of history included, lots of replay value.  Definitely a game you want someone to show you how to play.  Really brings out the competitive spirit.  Very easy to get into character, you tend to use election campaign terminology while playing (I really need an endorsement in the south, I need to buy more media time out west . . .)

This is to TS what San Juan is to Purto Rico. Easier to explain and 'grok', plays faster, but at the same time sacrifices a lot of the tension that TS produces so nicely. Whether that is good or bad depends on which side of the fence you sit.		`

A really good game.  Hard to find an opponent willing to sit down and invest 90 minutes, but so worth it! I'd rate it higher but it is only 2 player.  Most times I am around other gamers we play something for 3-5 players instead.

RATING: 7
An enjoyable game that has Nixon and Kennedy fighting toe-toe over the electoral map.  They can campaign in states, work the issues for momentum and endorsements or spend their political capital in the media.  A very simple system that rewards candidates who keep their eye on the target... winning Election Day!  Don't discount the issues and endorsements.  Don't get frazzled by your opponent's moves as you often won't need to react directly knowing that you're executing a winning campaign strategy that's netting you more end game points.  There's a lot of way to attack the game with smart card play, focused offense and preemptive defense.  UPDATE: Knocked rating down 1 point.  I love the design but it's not something I'd want to play all the time.  There's frustration in every game, it's certainly a dog fight to the end.

Played once with my little brother and while not an amazing session (he's 12 and not prone to strategizing too well), I saw real potential. I actually bought this to play with the wife as the go-to 2 player full boardgame experience but she's happy with Carc and Innovation. I'll have to give her a few more plays of both before I can bring this one out for regular play, but I hope she takes to it. It's really an amazing game.

Note: I've never played Twilight Struggle or similar
Note 2: I LOVE Innovation and am thrilled she took to it... but it's not a "full boardgame experience"!

*update August 2012* Played a full game with a competitive and fun buddy. Was a great time, good area control game. Looking forward to our next 2player session

*update Oct 2012* Played again with the same buddy. It was a lot of fun. At one point, we were slamming down cards one after the other just fighting over taking the lead in defense (I had a card where the event really did something great for the leader in that issue). He took the lead in the issues, giving him momentum markers and in the second round I had none. He was squashing me in that sense. However, he neglected other areas, like campaigning and media, so I was able to build in NY while he was reliant on events (and all my cards, of course, benefitted him and I had no pre-emptive momentum! So I had to skillfully do damage control, which he totally fell for :D ). It was a lot of fun and both of us learned from our mistakes. Haven't played it enough to see if the skill/luck issues some people complain about are really within the game and/or a problem to me, so I hesitate to give it a 9. But it's a good time.

*edit Dec 2012* This game doesn't get to the table enough so I'm going to sell it. Great game but there are other games I'd rather play with the wife and this one is too complicated to teach to new people all the time and sufficiently explore and enjoy. I still say it's an awesome game.

played prototype.   looked and played great.   debate effects seem rather minor.

I find myself opting out of this and prefer to play almost any other CDG right now.  I do not like the way the debate works and find the overall game fairly dull.  As an intro CDG, this is a good place to start, but I believe that this falls behind the other games in the genre.  hannibal adds a bit with the political control markers, but it is not that far beyond this and a better game.

This is a great 2 player game, but you have to be able to find somebody who will enjoy it.  This game is on the long side for me, but I still enjoy it.  The problem is I don't have anybody that enjoys it enough to get a good amount of plays out of it, so it mostly just sits on my shelf.

This game is all about the Kennedy/Nixon presidential race.  I am not a huge history buff, but I still think the theme is great.  The game starts with each player starting in their home state and some of the states already having some support cubes for one side or the other.  These are based on some historical data for the states that already had a huge support for one candidate or the other in the beginning.  On a typical turn each player is dealt some cards.  These cards represent events that actually happened throughout the presidential race.  The cards are marked clearly as to which candidate the card favors, so when deciding which cards to use you can quickly see if one will help you or not.  5 of these cards will get played during the round.  When you play a card you must decide if you want to use the card for the event, usually only if it helps you, or if you want to use it for the number of actions on the card.  The actions allow you to move your candidate to a new region, remove your opponents support cubes in a state, add your own support cubes to a state, add support cubes to the debate issues, or try to get some advertising going in a given region.  When a player plays a card and chooses to use the actions, the other player can force the event to happen, because a lot of times this card might help them, by playing one of their campaign tokens.  If you can predict that the player might do this, as you play the card, you have the option of playing 2 campaign tokens and saying that they can't trigger this event.  After the round awards are given, endorsements or more campaign tokens, for cubes in the debate section.

After a few rounds the debates come up.  During the rounds each player uses one of the cards to save for the debates.  In the debates you add cards for a given issue, marked on the card, and when one side has 2 cards for that issue it is then tallied up to see who wins it.  The winner has 2 actions to spend on state support for the first issue, 3 for the next and 4 for the last.

After two more normal rounds, this time you play two extra cards for additional support at the end of the game in a given state, again marked on the cards, the states are awarded to the candidates.  If a state has one of your cubes on it, you win it, if it is empty and you have endorsements in that region you win it, if it is empty and there aren't any endorsements it goes to the color as marked on the state.   The electoral votes are then tallied and the winner becomes president.

I really love this game and I give it a high rating because I would play it any chance I could get.  The theme might not be enjoyable by all.  Understanding how to get and use campaign tokens can be tricky for people the first time.  These are a few things that can turn people off to the game, not to mention it usually takes around 2 hours to play.  If you aren't distracted by any of those issues, this could be a great game for you.  It provides you with some tough decisions and really feels like you are fighting it out with the other player to see who will be the president.  Is it more important to hit the states, work on the debate issues, or get some more advertising?

Overrated.  Rating based on only one play, which was at best OK... but very dissatisfying for the following reasons:

- the debates seem nearly pointless, more a catchall for the discarding of relatively weak cards

- almost always seems better to use the cards for events than OPs

- a lot of back and forth moving of cubes that felt repetitive

- not sure about replay value

- wasn't excited by the game play

This was a definate let-down. The cards are too similar in effect to each other, and the thematic elements feel pointless, most of all the debates around the halfway point, which doesn't actually result in too much.

A cleaner version of Twilight Struggle; I really love it.  This doesn't have quite the same scoring complexity (the game only has one scoring event that occurs at the end; there's no mid-game scoring), but it takes the mechanics of Twilight and implements them in a much more elegant (and faster-playing) fashion.

First game felt a little bit like running after each other without developing my own plan. Also playing the cards in a specific order felt more as damage control than making awsome combo's.

Acquired in a Math Trade. Haven't gotten to play yet. Simulated a play. Not sure the wife will go for this one. I have a couple of buddies who would enjoy it I'm sure.

I have the first edition. Zev, being the good christian that he is, sent me an extra 20 cubes (10 blue, 10 red) to match what the second edition has.

Test drove it with my wife. She liked it more than I expected her to, but I think this may be too long to hit the table.

The game has a strong theme matched with good looks and interesting mechanics. I like it, but in the end don't feel a strong draw to it. First, it's too much of an area control game for my tastes: I want to build something lasting, not squabble over some cubes. Second, I find it rather difficult to get longer two-player games on the table, for some reason. So, good in theory, less interesting in practise.

Indifferent.

Loved my first play, feeling completely immersed in the theme and the arc of the game. Subsequent plays quickly lost my interest. Once you've seen the cards a couple times, the excitement of the theme recedes, leaving you with an unsatisfying tug of war in which your opponent undoes everything you did on your last turn and vice versa, vying for miniscule incremental advantages. I'll play it again, but didn't need it in my own collection, so I traded it away.

It's Nixon vs. Kennedy in a fun card driven game that does a great job of embracing the title theme. Components and board are first rate - well, they could have included a few more support cubes.

Long 2 player, area-control game that is similar to Twilight Struggle.

Each player uses cards to try to influence the 50 states. 5ish rounds are played, then debates happen, then 2 more rounds are played and then the election happens. Whoever has sufficient number of electoral votes wins.

It sounds ok to play, but I'm not into the theme and it runs long for a 2 player for me.

Move over Die Macher, 1960 is nipping at your heels.  This game may not have the depth of Die Macher, but the streamlined complexity and ability to be played in less than 2 hours (rather than 5) makes it a worthy contender for best election game currently on the market.  It really captures the feel of limited resources, key states, and multiple ways to win and election   Also, the history factor is a great draw for me.

Very cool game. I love the theme and how the game evokes the setting through the cards. I'd love to keep this, but after only one play back in 2009, it's getting very difficult to justify the space it takes up in my allotted cabinet. As I type this, I still want to keep it. Maybe I can get it out again by starting a conversation about the impending potentially disastrous election. All this to say...I just barely want to trade it.

Nicely done, Matthews and Leonhard!  I own but have not yet played Matthews' and Gupta's Twilight Struggle, and I'd love to compare the two.  But 1960 is very accessible, short, well-produced, streamlined, and full of tough decisions.  However, there are a few wonky things that are actually wonky, or Natus hasn't yet figured out: Debates, Elections, Media, and How To Win. The theme certainly doesn't grab me like the one for TS did; maybe someone can drum up a vicious variant based on the 2000 elections? But more plays will tell, and I *do* want to play more.

Very Solid. It's easy to explain and doesn't take very long, yet strategic, flavorful, deep and exciting. The theme is closely connected and offers a lot of opportunity to outplay your opponent. Its complexity makes it beginner-friendly, while rewards familiarity of the cards as players begin to understand and anticipate cards that will appear in the deck. A small nitpick is the high randomness due to cards and different kinds of check that require pulling cubes out of a bag, but I can live with it as it's supposed to represent real life, and life is unpredictable and everchanging anyway.

RATING: 6
The more I play this game, the more I wish I was playing Twilight Struggle instead.  It may be unfair to compare 1960 to its older brother all the time, but the fact is that these two games occupy very similar positions in my gaming repetoire, and playing 1960 necessarily means that I'm not playing Twilight Struggle.  1960 does have some wonderful mechanics, especially everything surrounding the cube bag.  It does a great job of introducing an element of luck while simultaneously balancing the game.  Any pain you may feel from losing initiative or getting a draw of low CP cards will be mitigated by gains in the cube bag.

Unfortunately, the cube bag isn't used enough in the game, and this is because of the power of the cards.  This is one of my complaints with 1960; the relative power of the events is so great that the game loses the tension of deciding how to use your cards.  Whereas in Twilight Struggle you must give up something when you use the card as points or vice versa, in 1960 the decision is pretty binary.  If the event helps you at all, you play the card for the event.  If it does not, you use it for points.  A side effect of this is that players have many, many opportunities to place influence in states without obeying the normal influence placing rules.  This means that the location of your candidate and having 4 or more cubes in a location isn't really very important.  And because players can easily add cubes to a state being carried by their opponent, they rarely need to make support checks from the bag.  This means that the balancing mechanic doesn't come into play that often.

There are other things missing from 1960 as well.  Any sort of board positioning is unimportant, because of the power of the cards (as I mentioned above), and because of the ease of placing influence in a location.  This is understandable considering the theme, but it still something I miss.  In addition, the large draw deck means that it is very difficult to plan for any cards other than what you have in your hand.  This isn't necessarily bad, but once you've played Twilight Struggle, you can see the strategic additions that the 3 different decks adds.  Finally, the fact that your opponent's events don't happen automatically is certainly more forgiving, but again detracts from the tension of playing your hand.  A few momentum markers and you don't even have to worry.

1960 isn't a bad game.  It's actually a good one (though I have played almost a dozen times now, and Kennedy has never won).  It's just that it isn't really anything that different from Twilight Struggle in terms of when and who I play it with, so it ends up being an inferior experience.  I understand why so many people like it, and it may in fact be better for those people, but it isn't a better game.  And frankly, I don't see myself playing it very often.

Good game, a little lighter than Twilight Struggle. Which you'll prefer depends in part on your reaction to the degree to which you know what events are coming (and that they will return if not played as events). On the whole, I think I lean slightly to TS over 1960.

Plays quickly and cleanly. The setting is good and the game elements are thematic. It is fun but not very heavy or really involved. There is strategy but fairly superficial, although you can work to your plan with adaptation as necessary. Several different strategies seem viable although the big states are the crucial battlegrounds of course. Repeated play shows that you do need a balanced approach.

Great 2-player game which requires you to make the right choices at the right time. The theme of political tension to win the race for the White House works perfect.

RATING: 7
Solid, solid, solid two person game that simulates the 1960 election in an entertaining and competitive manner.  The game is surprisingly quick, too.  My first play clocked in at just over an hour, had minimal rule look ups, and did not feel like a real game with tough decisions right off of the bat.  Very similar mechanics to Twilight Struggles with just a few wrinkles to make it its own game, and anyone looking to see how a game can be an educational endeavor should experience this game.

edit: After more plays, downgraded from an 8 to a 7.  Still very much enjoy the game, and really like the educational aspect.  However, it does seem that there is more-or-less a rule for how to play.  Always play about 1/3 - 1/2 of your cards to issues; use card effects to deal with 4+ control; use CPs to duke it out for the 5 or so states with the most electoral votes; and absolutely focus on that last turn.  For two players that know the game, the score is always going to be close, and is going to come down a bit to the luck of what cards you've got when.  In that sense it mirrors the actual election, but for a game, it comes off a little bit samey.  I'll always play, though, so it's a rock solid 7.

RATING: 9
Greatly enjoyed playing this game. I love the hand management and the back and forth trying to gain support in states while setting up events to help me and minimize the help to my opponent while having to struggle with long term strategy. I love the moment at the start of a new turn when you have a bunch of cards you have to struggle to deal whether it is a garbage hand or even a great hand that needs to be played just right. The rebate was a bit of a let down but I can see its value. Next time I play I will have a better I idea how much or how little I should invest into it. I have also played Twilight Struggle which has many of the same game mechanics but I believe 1960 is much more elegant game. The tug-a-war with the cubes works better than the chit-fest of TS and I much prefer pulling cubes from the bag for randomness than the simple dice roll because it helps counter balance the game with poor hands. I like the momentum tokens OK, although I miss the way that in TS opponents events are always played so you have to do a lot more damage management and the gaining momentum cards are a much weaker version of the scoring cards in TS. Even with these minor issues I still found 1960 a much more enjoyable experience than TS even though I lost my first game at 1960 and won my first game of TS.

I like politics and I love political history, but I'd thought I'd hate them in a game. On the surface this struck me as a bit of a snooze but how wrong I was. This is an excellent game that cleverly combines hand management and area control. I would posit that the Nixon player seem to have a bit of an advantage (the Nixon player has won about 90% of the 20 or so games we've played) due to the geographical starting positions but that's my only gripe with this game. It is now my favourite two-player game, and it plays under the 2-hrs mark. With 1960 every day is a SuperTuesday!

To me the game felt to be a bit over-hyped due to the current election. As the game moves onto the later rounds, it began to feel a bit repetitive. Maybe the gameplay will be much more engaging to someone who can relate to places and events in the game, but since it's much less than an accurate simulation of history, the theme alone could not save the game for me.

Interesting play.  I like it.  Can't say I thought I'd say that about a political game, but hey, it's fun.  Game does have some pretty random elements involved, meaning cards drawn can swing the game one way or another, but it is still entertaining and oddly enough...educational.

RATING: 7
After one play, I enjoyed this much more than Twilight Struggle. The cards felt much better balanced (i.e. more events had both parties on them, giving you many more useful things you could do on your turn) and the ability to turn in momentum markers to prevent your opponent from playing that painful card against you is a great feature. I didn't care for the debate section of the game - the amount of luck in the game feels manageable in every other part of the game but this. I look forward to playing this one a few more times.

This started out as a solid 8 or 9 for me. Now after realizing that the issues are the way to play, the game got boring! It's one flat boring srategy, that if yo udo not follow you will lose, and if you do follow, you and your opponent will be bored. Sad, because I really liked this game. Havent had the heart to try a varient to 'fix' this 'problem'

Played a game this weekend vs. a new player. it still came all down to the endorsements. Because I had endoresements in 3 of the 4 regions, i really didnt care much about anything else. I simply wiped the midwest clean, and didnt care much what my opponent was doing. I ended up winning handily.

RATING: 8
This is a significantly lighter game that Twilight Struggle, and fans of TS may be disappointed if they are expecting the same depth with a new theme.  Some may also be turned off by the chaos of election day.  Personally, I enjoyed it.  It felt like juggling 7 balls with one hand tied behind my back.  The excitement of the final election results was evocative of recent close presidential races.  The quick playtime makes this a likely winner for me.  Rating likely to go up with repeated play.

--update--
I hear that some of the election-day chaos was removed, making results quite a bit less random.  Interested in seeing how this affects the play experience!

--update--
What I heard was true.  Adding edges to the states and endorsements makes a world of difference.    There is still quite a bit of chance in the game, but the amount feels much more appropriate.  It leaves things tense without feeling arbitrary.  Easy bump up of one point, and I can imagine it seeing more.  Strong recommendation.

Would have been a perfect 10 if the game made better use of the map board. Instead, it is mainly about competing for the most powerful states in the East region like NY, PA, etc. (Yeah, I realise that is thematically correct but I am scoring this from the gameplay point of view).
Art on this is just fantastic!

As far as my track record is concerned, I still proudly maintain a clean sheet after 10 plays with both sides against 6 different opponents including seasoned wargamers, witty ameritrashers and casual gamers alike.

After now having played this twice I thought I'd better add at least a small comment. This game really is great and I really have had fun both times I've  played it and not just fun in places fun throughout (apart from one notable exception). The components are great and well designed, the cards interesting and well balanced and the game play fast and inspiring. The only one niggle I have with this game is the debates section. Now stop right there before you lambast me for being unintelligent enough to not know how the American election works or for being presumptuous enough to think that it should be simply done away with. I can see the need for it both as a representation of reality and as a game mechanic, it's just that the mechanic seems wrong somehow; Let me explain, most players including myself use the strategic area to hide cards that they don't want there opponent to get the use of for the first six rounds (sound plan you may say to yourself). This means that when you get to the debate you just hand issues to your opponent, how does that make sense? So now you might say "well just put put cards you can use in your strategic area?" "Well." I would reply. You then give your opponent accesses to there powerful cards and as you only win a max of 4CP in the debate what the hell would be the point in that? So on the whole great game with a slightly strange bit in the middle.

Solid game design.  At the same time, after one solo play and one competitive play, I don't feel a great desire to play it again.  It's not bad, but it's neither compelling nor especially fun.  Interesting for all the history on the cards though!  Twilight Struggle (same designer and similar mechanics) is about 8 zillion times more fun to play.

RATING: 6
For the first 2 or 3 plays through, 1960: The Making Of The President gives the feel of being a political campaign manager in the form of a war game. Early plays are fun, grueling contests to win the hearts and minds of the American people and provide an education of the U.S. political landscape in 1960.

The game is as well-designed as it could be. Each game component is attractive and well-implemented. For new players, rules are not too difficult to learn. A curious addition to the game is the debate turn which uses mechanics similar to Schotten-Totten to win debate issues.

1960:tMotP initially only suffers from the fact that it is for 2-players only, but after a few plays its other limitations will appear. Once a player becomes familiar with, or memorizes, the cards the game loses its appeal. Variability dissolves as players move toward set strategies making each playthrough a forgone conclusion. Experienced players will unavoidably slaughter beginners.

All that was needed to improve 1960:tMotP was too have more cards than could be used in the course of the game. This would have added some uncertainty to each play mixing things up for veterans.

Another minor quibble: The cards seem to have a bias towards the Republicans. This may be thematic, but can be problematic when introducing 1960:tMotP to new players as most people I've played it with prefer to play Democrats and fight an uphill battle all game.

OK, I'm impressed.  VERY impressed.  A political game as nasty as the campaign that inspired it.

Again, game designers: This is how to jam a ton of difficult choices onto a finite set of decisions and make it have meaning.  The deferred choice you make each turn determines the fate of the game.

I'd rate it higher if the debates weren't so... strange.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
First, I want to say that I'm politically independent before anyone questions what I'm saying :-)

I'm troubled that there are no Nixon debate cards.  Wasn't there an issue that those that heard the debates say Nixon won, and those that saw the debate said Kennedy won?  If the debates were that good, why does Kennedy just get two debate cards?  Also, one of Kennedy's debate cards is quite powerful and cannot be countered or mitigated in any way.  Maybe that's because the designers are Democrats... I don't know.

Also, media/endorsements did not seem to have a major impact on the game.

Conclusion: Twilight Struggle is the better of the two.

Another area majority game using the Twilight Struggle engine. Shorter and simpler, but still feels very similar, and the tugs-of-war over majorities in key areas are also there (Actually, there is a bit too much of that). Feels less thematic than Twilight Struggle but that might also be due to the fact that the theme just isn't that interesting to gamers outside the US. Anyway, that makes the game a rather abstract area majority exercise for me. Also, it's quite difficult for me to keep track of who's in the lead.

The rest cube / support check mechanism is nice, and preparing for the debates also adds some tension to the first five rounds, even though the debates aren't that important. Very high component quality, especially the cards are the best I've ever seen.

My new favourite CDG?  I'm not sure yet, but further playings will help me find out.

UPDATE:  Nixon and Kennedy have each taken one-half of the victories, so balance seems good.  The most-recent game went to Kennedy with a last-minute switch of CA and PA, which to me is both a strength and a weakness; a player is never truly out of contention, but on the other hand, no lead is truly safe.  

For now, I've upped my rating to 9.5, as this game is hitting the right chords with me at the moment.

Well implemented card driven area control with a rich political theme. It can't escape comparison with Twilight Struggle, which is less accessible, but a much better game due to it's feeling of progression and tension. (8.5)

RATING: 8
Jason Matthews' follow-up to the blockbuster Twilight Struggle applies similar mechanics to the 1960 elections in the US - cards as driving force by means of managing small hands, territorial control of different regions and some extra features to get rid of the least useful cards. 

Even though the topic isn't as prone to a linear approach and thus doesn't grab as quickly, 1960 does improve some of the flaws that ever so slightly pop up in Twilight Struggle: the only randomizer are the card draws each turn, there aren't surprise scoring rounds during the game, the distribution of forces on the board can be influenced by some "regional parameters" (media and endorsement) and there are two fixed phases (debates and election) with separate procedures to use discarded cards tactically as well.

1960 might take more effort to digest than Twilight Struggle and offer less immediately compelling gameplay, but there are more layers in strategy and tactics; plus, skillful moves never get marred by a fatal dice throw.

RATING: 7
Good game to play in an election year. And it's a game that everyone should try at least once. It's a great mix of euro mechanics and history. This shows that games can be both fun AND educational. I were teaching a US history or a civics class, I would include this game in my curriculum.

It's a good game to play, despite some imbalances with the mechanics; some are anemic and never get used (media), others are over-powered (issues) - which might be okay if it were closer to reality. Overall, I think the mechanics of Twilight Struggle don't translate as well to elections as they do to Cold War issues.

I like this more than Twilight Struggle *gasp*! It has a better overarching narrative, the game plays out till the end every time, and the pacing of it is pointedly felt throughout.

I like that the debates is like a whole separate side-game that you have to plan for from turn 1. I like the bag-o-cubes and how it can be leverage to a player's advantage. I made the mistake of selling the Z-Man printing years ago. Won't happen again. Playing the reprint recently reminded me why I like it so much.

Really enjoyed this one. Full of tough choices on how and when to use the cards. This game would rank a '9' except...... My only concern is one of geography. Not being a "yank" means I'm not entirely sure of where some states lie on the map, and the two letter state abbreviations used on the cards (which you need to pay attention to during the last two campaign turns) are confusing to me. All the same, this is one I hope to play more - Secret Santa 2007

This is the new gateway game between Euros and CDGs.  It's relatively fast, clocks in at under two hours, and has good presentation.  But it's also wildy variable, and in four games I have yet to see one that has been close.  Its not perfect and probably lacks long term replayability, but it also has the potential to open the doors to similar games, which is a good thing.

Awesome game I just don't get to play enough! Now every time I start hearing political discussions my mind wanders to this game. This game is wonderfully informative, educational, and thrusts you into the political process. For those who could care less about politics...you will find yourself learning and immersed in the whole political process...and that is saying something!

This is a very thematic game. After a few plays I think that the replayability will not be that great as most of the decisions are fairly obvious. In addition the issues and media aspects of the game don't work quite right. It feels like luck in the final turn plays too much of a role in who wins, which is a problem considering how long it takes.

RATING: 8
Less frustrating than TS and 1989, thanks to the use of the 'cubes in a bag' mechanism to resolve support checks. No 'all or nothing' die rolls. Even if you fail a support check, you still glean some benefit as you've reduced your opponent's political capital a little. More games ought to use this mechanism.

A brilliant little game.  Takes all the beauty of Twilight Struggle, and simplifies it a bit, while adding nice quirks that really fit the theme.  One of the best area control games out there.

RATING: 6
Only one play, but you seemed to be very much at the mercy of the cards drawn, with few really difficult choices. Favourable events almost always seemed worth playing and the media and issues elements appeared to have limited impact. Some cards were extremely strong, particularly if played in the final round, and a single card could easily swing the game. Had I been more interested in the theme the score might have been a point higher and I will play again but I doubt it will have much replayability after that.

A really great game. 

Very impressed on my first play - great game system, tight play and unbelievably tense.

A CDG playable in 2 hours. There's really nice decisions each turn on which cards to play for events, which for adding cubes on states (preferably the big VP earning ones), and how much you'll need to commit to the issues wars (which allow you to get the necessary momentum markers to play your opponent's events, plus the endorsement markers needed to win ties). Sometimes it descends to a bit of pushme-pullyou tit-for-tat, but the attraction of playing events eventually gets over it. There can be a dramatic finale with game-deciding fortunate / unfortunate swings on the last plays of the game which you need to be comfortable with. Other than that, a very enjoyable system with rich decision making throughout.

Extremely good recreation of this presidential election, using a card system similar to Twilight Struggle.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I seem to spend most of this game without a clue of how I am doing votes wise, but maybe I should just accept that there isn't a VP track around the edge of the board to keep me perfectly informed, and play the game on gut feeling. You could constantly count up exactly how you were doing in votes, but it would make for a mighty long game - instinctively, I go for the big number states and try to win (or at least stay in contention) in these, and if I can pick up the odd 5 or 10 vote state along the way, so much the better. This approach for me recreates the fog-of-war which the respective campaigns must have felt historically, and is probably the spirit in which the designers would want the game to be played.

There are different ways to win the game (never a bad thing), but if your opponent is concentrating on Issues, for example, you had better put some effort into issues as well, or you will find yourself behind in Endorsements very quickly.

All-in-all, a solid 9 at the minute, with lots more games planned.

I found this game to be less interesting than Twilight Struggle. While I know it’s not completely fair to compare the two, they do occupy a similar space. 

I found a lot of the gameplay more opaque, in that it was often difficult to tell what effect a choice made. Perhaps through repeated plays, that would become much clearer.

I usually don't play games longer than an hour. I've got a few that I like to pull out once or twice a year but for the most part anything around 30 minutes sees the most play. 1960, though, captured my imagination and I finally broke down and bought a copy. The first time my wife and I tried it out we reached the third turn when I made a comment about the game not being long at all. Looking up, I noticed that a lot more time had passed than I realized. This game kept us entertained for two hours and it did not at all _feel_ like a two hour game. We had fun and I can't wait to play again.

This game is pretty dense: even after playing, I'm still not sure how important the various strategies are.  One thing's for sure, though, you definitely don't want to run out of momentum markers, because then your opponent will inevitably go hog wild playing cards that would be awesome for you.  Getting the right cards at the right times seems important, but I'm still not sure how much luck is a factor here.

Pros:
+Rulebook is one of the best I've seen. It didn't quite click for me until the example of play at the end, but having that included was great. It's very well laid out with great examples.
+Map looks really nice and the artwork is well done.
+Cards are historic and as far as I know, all accurate.
+Components look and feel great. Cards are linen finished and cubes are a nice deep blue/red.
+Plays reasonably quick.

Cons:
-A little hard for my head to fully wrap around the rules, but after I got a play in and read the sample of play, it all seemed so easy.
-Very math heavy at the end adding up the electoral votes.
-Seemed to be short on cubes the first play, will change this on subsequent plays if that's not the case.
-Could see this getting stale after a bit, but I really can't wait to give this a lot more of my time.

TRY May/08: Wow!  Fantastic theming, and solid game.  Definitely has me interested in trying out other election games, like Die Macher & Twilight Struggle.

Felt like you could too easily ignore the states with single-digit points, while concentrating only on the big ones.  However, I suspect that this mimics reality.

Played 6-7 games or so: This game is really growing. My wife and I really likes to play 1960. The boards and the components are truly beautiful. I am putting this one up half a notch. It has slowly climbed from my initially 7 to a 8.5.

Played more: It's more challanging and fun than I first recogniced - I bumping this up to an 8.

RATING: 7
I've never played Twilight Struggle, so I suppose my rating won't be sullied by its supposed greatness. This game, despite basically consisting of moving cubes, is very immersed in theme. The cards are all awesome to look at and read, and you get a good sense of history and that what you are doing actually matters. The only part that sours the game for me is that it seems like everything you do for the first five or six turns seems moot when you get down to the final three.

Update: really fiddly setup (I have to place all 50 emblems?!) combined with the momentum markers (that I never really cared for) and the seesawing issues track have worn on me over time. In addition, I have played Twilight Struggle and now feel foolish for ever thinking this could touch it. At least these guys know how to make me care about history.

Less competitive than TS, I liked this one better since it plays fast and has a less forced narrative outisde the awkward debate phase (TS multidecade theme made its use of events more superficial.) This game is less competitive and nailbiting but I find it charming and suits my rather biased expectations. TS is therefore a more superior competitive game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
A bit of a disappointment, really. TS is one of my all time favorites and the prospect of having a similar game playable in 1.5 hours seemed great. This is not that game, though.

It's playable in 90 minutes, give or take a few. I think luck plays a very significant role, much bigger than in TS, even though there are no dice. The problem is that the luck of the draw can be decisive and the game doesn't provide the players with the tools to deal with it. Rest cubes seem to be the way to balance things out but I don't think they're powerful enough. Campaigning and positioning on the issues are very zero-sum actions, so the whole game becomes a boring and repetitive exercise.

The components are great, the theme is nicely connected to some of the game mechanics and everything is balanced.

I've only played this once and I would play again.  I learned a lot about the Nixon/Kennedy election.  I was Nixon and won!

I just got this game and after playing once I can say I love it. The historical content adds a very interesting element. Who would've thought your knowledge of a presidential election could be so enhanced by a game that was fun and challenging? 

I love the gameplay and the balance between luck and strategy. It definitely helps to draw well but it doesn't help enough to overcome bad strategy. The rules are fairly complex but well laid out (they may take an hour or so to go over but once you get into the game it just takes a quick glance back every now and then for confirmation). All in all a great game that everyone should try.

RATING: 8
You'll have lots of options in this game. Sometimes it feels that there are too many of them!
However, the theme is probably the one thing that drove me to try this. 
It's really challenging trying to be most effective during your turns.

This feels a bit more limited compared to Twilight Struggle. In Space Race you could dump your useless cards, but in that debate-section, usually they backfire you.

This can be finished in something like 2-3h, which feels just fine. Probably one of the most exciting part (when done correctly) is the counting of votes. Especially a close result will make you hold your breath!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fascinating, very enjoyable game, injecting real events and personalities into a very entertaining, and ultimately tense gaming experience.  First time through it took us 4 1/2 hours.  Should get down to about 3 hours next time.  We ran out of cubes early in the Election Phase, though, so that was less interesting than we'd expected it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Though this isn't Twilight Struggle, I enjoy the theme of this game, as well as the relatively simpler way it captures the decisions of heavier CDGs. The three major shortcomings for me are the fairly arithmetic-heavy scoring, which makes it tedious to assess how one is doing midgame, the much lower tension of holding your opponent's events (relative to TS) given the relative scarcity of momentum markers, and the fact that it's so easy to undo the opponent's influence that the game often involves a large portion of back-and-forth over the big states.

I don't know if it was the [i]actual game[/i] or the way the [i]game has been hyped[/i] here on BoardGameGeek, but I was quite disappointed in it, even though it's a [i]fairly[/i] good game. The thing that bugged me most was New York and some of the areas around it. I know that it's a [b]historical simulation[/b] but having New York and the neighbouring electorials worth so much means that both players will concentrate on that area and there will be a tug of war there.
Also, the debate-turn seems [i]mighty[/i] pointless to me. I'll have to play it a couple of more times before I pass last judgement, but our first game was won by one point in Nixon's favour and before we counted the votes, we were sure he'ld win by [i]a landslide[/i]... a little strange.

Upped the rating and the weight.  My first thought was 'What? A game that re-enacts an election(albeit one that must have been particularly interesting to spectate)?  Whatever.'  But this is a very clever game that is very well balanced.  I say that because my friend beats me equally well playing Nixon or Kennedy.  There is a certain element of luck, but over the game it evens out most of the time.  

Play was really slow the first few times but picked up after we got the hang of it.  Some hands are really tough to figure out.

A brilliant meshing of theme and mechanisms. Every move seems to hold the promise of furthering the cause; the push and pull of regional swings, resource management, timing your moves just so, whether to put efforts into the Media now or wait a few turns, when to press for leadership on issues...the full swing of a presidential race pulls you in and keeps you guessing until the final turn on Election Day. 

If there is a weak point to the game, like others have stated, I would cite the round of Debates; it's not that it doesn't work...it does, and it's interesting as a break from the other turns surrounding it...but it feels anti-climactic and doesn't always yield as much advantage as a few well-timed cards might also bring. This is a truly minor quibble, however; the flow of the game is always exciting, always challenging.

RATING: 6
Historical game with a very card-game feel.  There's a lot of variability in what you draw that can swing the odds in your favor even with sub-par play.  However, it plays fairly quickly and is very intuitive.  One major downside is the time it takes to re-calculate the scores when states swing.  This can be fixed through using an excel file or something else that quickly determines the scores on the fly.

Based on one play. I look forward to playing it again, I really suspect I'll raise my rating. It has great replayability value, of coures due to the number of unique cards and the choise between executing the card's action and hence putting the card out of play, and using the card for getting your markers out on the board at the risk/benefit of someone picking it up again and playing it as an action. Intriguing!

1960 is a great game. Good mechanics. I like it. But for some reason, when it really comes down to it, I'd rather play something else.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Gives most of the same feel as playing Twilight Struggle (one of same designers), with some variations & new elements e.g. drawing cubes from a bag instead of dice rolling. It is also shorter to play, a little less taxing on the brain, and has MUCH better components eg. proper board, wooden cubes, nice bag.

NOTE: Flip cardboard insert over to fit everything back in the box, particularly after sleeving the cards!

NOTE: In Boardgame Babylon (episode #44), it was mentioned that the next print run of 1960 is going to include more cubes to mitigate the problem of running out of cubes. Or just use eg. endorsement markers to represent 4 cubes.

A watered down Twilight Struggle without that game's depth, strong theme, or excellent game flow.  Liked it the first couple of plays, but went quickly downhill.  Just stick with TS.

Nice mechanics. Due to the different values of the states, I've got some difficulty determining whether a game is going well or not; hopefully this changes after some plays.
The debate round seems rather poorly done.

RATING: 6
After a couple of plays, I think it's best to say this is an experience game in which despite some tactical planning, there are several chaotic factors which will undermine your plays (so really fits the theme I guess). With that in mind there will be less frustration and crying in the coffee cups printed on the board. Unlike other experience games such as War of the Ring and Fury of Dracula, 1960 is an excellent example of a game being an educational medium as I'm learning US geography, state emblems, the political system and a narrative of an important time in American history. This is why I rate this higher than the other fantasy titles mentioned.

RATING: 8
A really interesting and appropriately themed area control game. The event cards, rest cubes, Campaigning Points and momentum markers all seem well-balanced. Advertising seems less balanced (not really worth it). There are a lot of tough decisions as you need to be everywhere at once but don't have enough resources, obviously. Just like real election campaigning! A highly recommended 2-player game but familiarity with the cards and the importance of controlling the Issues makes it extrememly difficult for a newbie to beat an experienced player. Usually happy to play this one if we have the time.

Challenging election game that presents the players with numerous choices each turn. No two games will ever be the same. No turn can be wasted. The right card played at a critical point may decide the game. Easier to grasp than Twilight Struggle and plays fairly quickly.

RATING: 8
A shorter, more streamlined Twilight Struggle. Nicer components, simpler rules, but loses some of the sense of urgency in the process until the last 2 turns. Still a great game, especially when you don't have time for a game of TS. For some reason, I can never seem to win. Not even close. Ever.

RATING: 7
Dying to play it, but not sure my usual gaming partner (11 year old son) will dig the theme...and if he doesn't like the theme, he doesn't usually like the game.

02/28/10:  Finally played...well, it was okay.  The actual land control game is pretty abstract.  The media/endorsement elements seem sort of tacked on and unnecessary...I'm sure they play some sort of role, but it didn't come up much in our game.  I'd probably try a second game with someone other than the boy, but he was bored, and that made it probably less fun than it would be against someone who actually had an interest in history or politics.    We'll see.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Was fun, but the balance of the options just seems off. Advertising isn't quite worth it; issues are quite important. Debates seem to be where you put cards you don't want your opponent to resurrect (rather than actually playing cards to win them).

RATING: 6
A game I’d been wanting to try for ages, having adored Twilight Struggle and enjoyed Campaign Manager. I had always assumed it would have much more in common with TS, but in fact the rapid tit-for-tat exchanges feel more like CM. Unfortunately, I think it may fall between two stools. It’s not as quick and tactical as CM but nor does it have the deep strategic tension and satisfaction of TS. The main problem is that, unlike TS, it lacks a real spatial dimension, and mostly lacks a time dimension too. Playing cubes into a state early doesn’t really give any benefit over playing them late, especially as carrying a state doesn’t feel as strong as control in TS. And there’s no in-game scoring (fair enough given the theme) so it’s all about getting the last say. This puts more focus on the rewards you can get during the game, leading to a tit-for-tat battle over the issues. The other big difference over TS is that I just don’t feel scared looking at a hand full of opponent events. The momentum system means you can usually preempt one, ditch one, and play any others when they don’t do much damage. And it usually seems obvious when to play a card as event or for campaign points - particularly as many of the events are strictly better in the number of campaign point equivalents they give you. On the plus side, it is half the length of TS and easier to get into, but as the streamlined Age of Industry is to the clunky masterpiece Brass, so 1960 is to the miraculous TS.

Is 1960 as good as it spiritual ancestor - Twilight Struggle? The short answer is not quite. I still prefer Twilight Struggle

The long answer:
Matthews kept the core mechanic of events for your opponent being triggered when you play the card. It has been tweaked in that the opponent must use a momentum marker to trigger the event. 
Is the game thematic? That is the mechanics are in line with the theme.
The core play is to use your action points to jockey for positions in the various states. Which like the campaigns focuses on the key states for the electoral vote.
Playing to issues is how you get momentum markers and endorsements. So the issues are important. The markers allow you steal the events from your opponent's play and many of the events are dependent on controlling an issue. 
The endorsements make it easier to control a region since you only have to tie (and not beat your opponent).
Finally the media allows for effective counter-attacks to help you reclaim lost ground.

The games looks to be more balanced than Twilight Struggle - don't have the asymmetry forced by the divided decks. However I enjoyed the intermediate regional scoring of TS more. However, the final election is the theme of 1960.

All in all a tense game with an evocative theme.

On reflection I don't think I would play this game without house rules to make debates more significant and the advertising action more viable.

RATING: 8.5
It's complex without being complicated (takes some effort to learn the rules yet play is pretty second nature once you get going), and enjoyable enough for normal gamers while also stroking my poli-sci nerdity. I've played several election board games and this one is the only one to make campaigning not-so-clunky.

As somebody leery of GMT products because of the assumption they're overly rule-heavy and serious I'm both happy to have bought and played the Z-man version to give it a chance before the reboot and also happy that GMT picked it up to keep it in print because it's a worthy game. Aesthetically, however, I prefer the Z-man original.

This game, with Twilight Struggle, is one of my favorite. The game component are superb, specilly the card design, although I find the TS cards more effective to deliver essential informations. The rules are clear and the rule book is also superb. The game is an on going and very tensed management of cards and event. After 5 plays (3 recorded and 2 non recorded) I find that the Nixon player has a certain advantage. Knowing this, it make the play of the Kennedy side an additionnal chalenge.

Ce jeu est, avec Twilight Struggle, un de mes jeux favoris. Les composantes du jeu sont superbes, spécilement le design des cartes, bien que je trouve les cartes de TS plus efficace à livrer les informations essentielles. Les règles sont claires et le livre des règlement est superbe. La partie est un feu roulant de gestion de cartes et d'évènements. Après 5 parties (3 enregistrées et trois non enregistrées) je trouve que Nixon a un certain avantage. Sanchant ce, ceci rend le fait de jouer Kennedy un ''chalenge '' additionnel.

Végre! Kipróbáltuk ezt a remek játékot. Sajnos megint beleszaladtam abba, hogy csak nekem tetszett. Ez a jövőt illetően nem sok jóval kecsegtet. 
Rövid véleményem az, hogy egy jó kis mechanikával és remekül átérezhető tematikával van felvértezve. Nagyon jó minőségű a játék, kifejezetten a kártyák. Ezek messzemenőkig a legszebbek amivel valaha játszottam, sőt a minősége is remek. Komoly mélységű stratégiákat nem tudtunk még játszani, mert homály volt ezzel kapcsolatban mindegyikünkbe, de a fő csapásirányokat már megláttuk. De a tématámogatások a végén erősek lehetnek, csak a párom ezt szerintem nem használta ki százszázalékosan. A vita szerepét nem látom olyan kiemelkedőnek, de ahhoz többet kellene játszani, hogy ezt bátran kijelentsem. Jó sok minden összefügg a kártyákkal kapcsolatban, de mégsem vagyunk szerintem urai a játékunknak, egy kicsit a szerencse is közbeszólhat. Bár a fene tudja, olyan nagyon mégsem ül rá a játékra ez a szerencse. Kíváncsi lennék ezeknek a kocka bedobás, kihúzás matematikai összefüggéseire.
Summa summarum ez egy jó játék. Üröm az örömben, hogy egy államjelzőt nem találok. (Meglett):)

Még annyit, hogy nem írtunk történelmet, csak ismételtük. Kennedy nagyon nyert!
Update: még mindig izgi, mily meglepő.:) New yorkot elvesztettem kennedyként,(illetve az utolsó pillanatban nem sikerült fordítanom ott, így full bukó lett a játékom. De izgi volt nagyon!!!

This definitely takes more plays to get your head around, the rules are not that complex, despite a few special rules when it comes to intriciate details such as the canditates location etc., but the strategy, especially long-term is where the crux lies in this game. Knowing where to invest your campaign points and in the media etc. and accepting defeat in some states while going for a surprise attack in another is what makes this game interesting. I know it is based on the actual election mechanism but the fact that some states are worth ten times the votes than others feels really weird. HX

Another great Jason Matthews game. Simpler than Twilight Struggle. I like the election mechanics in 1960 more than those of Divided Republic (the 1860 election), but the four-player aspect of Divided Republic means that it will end up being played more than 1960. There are two-player games I would rather play (A Few Acres of Snow, for instance), but 1960 is a game I will definitely keep and play with my friends who are thematically drawn to it.

Continues to grow on me, and with gametable_online you can play it in under an hour. It doesn't have the same knife edge tension or memorable event cards as some CDGs, but it is very well balanced and it does feel like an election experience.

Really good, tense game ala Twilight Struggle.  Fabulous job by Zman in its production.  Look and be ashamed, GMT.  The debates are a brilliant new addition, and occur just at the right point in the game.    A couple smallish things keep it from being 10-worthy in my book:  I think the "issues war" can be a problem -- just not a very compelling game play to go tit-for-tat, though I think that is the smart thing to do sometimes.  I think one of the variants posted here might be a good fix to this, though I am anxious to hear from more play testers.  Also, I think it would be useful to know the score during the game.  It makes sense that there is only one scoring round, given the theme and all, but I kind of miss the sense of momentum and narrative that comes from knowing how you are doing during the play.  There is a nice on-line scoreboard posted here in the files section that we used and liked during the last play.   mlg 1/16/08.

RATING: 8.4
A really good game, I enjoyed it a lot at first.  As I played it more (i've had probably a dozen online plays, which says something of its replayability), I feel like I'm seeing some of its warts.

Issues: I sway back and forth on this mechanic.  As I play it more, it seems too powerful.  Ignoring it is not an option, but if 2 experienced players spend all game trying to grab an advantage, its boring.  There is a balancing factor in the quality of event you sacrifice, but for many cards (and virtually all 2CP cards) its worth it to play to issues.  that seems a bit too luck based.

On the whole a highly enjoyable game.

This game should not be dismissed as 'just [i]Twilight Struggle[/i] lite' or anything like that.  I think it's probably of similar complexity to [i]TS[/i], but without the same feeling that something epic is happening.  Having said that, it introduces some excellent garnish to the core [i]TS[/i] mechanics (Momentum Tokens and Support Checks to name two).  It certainly creates similar tension.  Highly recommended, even if you already have [i]TS[/i] or any other two-player CDG.

Good production quality. It's a very good card-driven game: thematic, with multi-purpose cards, balanced, with good tactical depth and some relevant strategic considerations. The game uses the U.S. map as the board where red (Republicans) and blue (Democrat) cubes are placed to mark control of each State. It is played in 9 rounds, one of which is the televised debate, and another - the last one - is the climatic and tense election day. Also, the designers couldn't find a better election to depict than the Presidential one from 1960: a very close dispute between two men that would become key figures of the 20th century - Kennedy and Nixon.

Watching election night at home always leads to thoughts about how best to campaign and what states to focus on for your own mythical presidential run.  1960 lets you explore those ideas.  When to hit the issues hard, when to glad hand the people and where, when to pander to the media - it's all in there and is tightly woven together.  The only thing I see preventing me from playing this a lot is that it is only for two players and it is somewhat lengthy compared to the usual two player games I get to the table.  I look forward to future plays.

More enjoyable than Twilight Struggle at first sight and the gameplay flows a bit smoother and nicer. Less stressful and a bit more fun to play than TS. The theme and the mechanisms integrade a bit better in here. Yet, I strongly think that you'll find much deeper and richer game in Twilight Struggle(or in other heavier CDGs) after a few plays, if that's something you are looking for. The swingy nature of the different events was quite laughable sometimes but yet the game came down to a single cube draw and the scoring was tight after all. I think it's in balance, just that the events were quite off-putting at times and actions were nullfied constantly by both sides. The randomness of the cube draw seemed quite high at times. The incentive for the big cities seems to be quite strong, although different events may direct you elsewhere, in any case quite straightforward gameplay on the map. I would rate it as a 8 for the enjoyment but I can't help to drop it to a 7 due the swingy nature of the events and the randomness of the cube draw.

This is a fun game more than a serious one. You race around throwing down cards and gathering support. In technical terms its just an area control game with historical chrome and because there are only 16 random events which being drawn from the same once used deck are effectively independent there is a lot of luck in it.
However, the important thing is it looks and feels like an election campaign and with the flavour on the cards it is entertaining. A better game than some of the other card driven games though not as good a simulation as many.

Got to play this for the first time tonight (7/7/15).
Great game, a bit easier to learn than Twilight Struggle which for me, is its nearest comparison.
Lots of tug-of-war as players choose to control states, push the issues, control the media or play thematic events from the period.

(11/20/07) - Just got this game today.

(12/11/07) - [6] - After 4 plays I find myself quite underwhelmed. Similar mechanics to Twilight Struggle, but just not as fun. The Advertising seems almost useless (except in limited circumstances) and the Momentum Markers mechanic just doesn't work well with the Event Cards. It's a decent game to play, but I'm not buying into the hype on this one.

(4/22/08) - TRADED AWAY

(09/08/2017) - Time is a flat circle. 1960 has re-entered the arena for a second go-around.

I'm not as into this one as Twilight Struggle. The rest cubes are an interesting idea. The components are better. (Update: Post-Deluxe edition, that no longer holds for me.) The debates do nothing for me. Even battling for state support wasn't exciting for me. Middlin'.

Ein weiterer „Twilight Struggle“-Klon, einfacher, schneller spielbar, Thema ist die Präsidentschaftswahl J.F. Kennedy vs. R. Nixon. Obwohl das Sujet aus heutiger Sicht vielleicht nicht zu spannend ist, können doch die unzweideutigen Regeln, der abwechslungsreiche, schnelle Rundenverlauf und die Tatsache überzeugen, daß hier a.) ein scheinbar schon enteilter Konkurrent noch lange problemlos eingeholt werden kann und b.) das abschließende Wahlergebnis durchaus größere und kleinere Überraschungen bereit hält. Außerdem sticht ins Auge, daß die damals aktuellen Politikfelder und die damaligen ideologischen Positionen der Demokraten und Republikaner sich von den heutigen wenig nur unterscheiden.

Twilight struggle lite.








=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
(+) Beautiful game!

(+) Simple yet interesting mechanic in which the order in which to carry out sequential card actions and careful management of momentum markers can have devestating effects on you or your opponent.

(+) Playing the democrats or the republicans really feels different. In our games, both parties have however snatched away decicive victories, so the game feels balanced (however: new players might find Nixon slighty easier or more 'straight forward', but don't be fooled, Kennedy is also a very strong faction!).

(+) The game kind of tells a story, and it is so much fun getting caught up in it! The game really makes you feel like you are running in an election.

(-) Pretty harsh game. When some cards fall on the wrong time, this could very much screw you. This kind of luck dependence is also present during cube draws from the bag. However, it is certainly possible to mitigate your luck by making the right decisions in the course of the game.

(-) This game is very 'in your face'. You directly oppose one player and you do so by making him/her hurt: you constantly destoy each others carefully built support on the map and you play agressive cards which can sometimes be more confrontational than some war games I know of. It could bring back some youth traumas of building the most magnificent sand castle on the coast, just to see it destoyed by a stupid fat kid - but this time the fat kid grew up, is red or blue and it doesn't happen to you once, but about 25 times in one evening! :)

(-) It takes a rather long time to play this game, certainly for a 2-player game. This sure is an evening-filler with a playtime of 2 to 3 hours! Presumably, when you get to know the cards, the game will flow more quickly, and who knows, maybe one day we will play it in 90 - 120 minutes?

Brilliant game. Gorgeous production. Plays similar to TS in that the challenge is managing the damage of your opponents events; however, 1960 provides some alternate means of overcoming the worst by forcing or blocking events with momentum markers. The trick is knowing when to expend your limited momentum markers to thwart disaster. Furthermore, 1960 does not have the constant tension of TS as the victory point track with the possibility of an early win is gone. A winner is not determined until the last turn during election day. Theme integration is as good as it gets. I can't wait to play this with my kids when they begin studying politics.

A light knock off of Twilight Struggle. Not as deep as its older brother, but easier to play and teach. I feel the time frame helps attract more gamers also.

Repeated plays continue to reinforce everything that I expected was in the game.  A close battle back and forth with swings in key states being the key.   A game of balancing needs in a variety of areas (states, issues, media) while trying to mitigate the actions/events of your opponent.  As one goes through the entire deck - it is not a game of bad event avoidance, but event mitigation - how to set up to accept your opponent's events to minimize their impact while maximizing yours.

After one play this game is pretty much exactly like Twilight Struggle. 

I really enjoyed the mechanics and how they were modified from Twilight Struggle to fit the theme of the game. This is a game that will hopefully see a lot of play.

Edit - After a few more plays this game is duller than dullsville...

The games aren't varied at all really. Nothing really exciting happens, either. And the game lasts way too long for it to be worth it.

RATING: 7
This is a good game. I can see getting burnt out every couple of plays to where it may take a while to hit the table again. After three (four?) plays of playing both sides, I still have a problem with the gamey debates and the election portion can sometimes be anti-climactic which just seems wrong for this topic.But, there are many positives and they have been outlined in the reviews.

Update: Dropped my rating to a 6 (from an initial 7) after realizing that the lack of climax bugs me more than I thought. This election needs to have an exciting conclusion. I don't mind playing it; I don't need to own it.

Update April 2011: I've been thinking I want to try this game out again and since I'm no longer around anyone who owns it I'm putting it on my want list. I'm glad I didn't say 'I never need to own this.' :)

Update October 2011: Got this to the table with a buddy from church. It was enjoyable. The debates will always feel gamey but they have to be in there. It was a *very* close game; I lost but it was a fun loss. Rating back up to 7.

This game is what I wanted Road to the White House to be.

RATING: 6
--Dec2007-- Pretty nice mechanics; vaguely similar (as it should be, one supposes) to _Twilight Struggle_ - yet sufficiently changed as to give a different game experience even discounting the theme change.  Speaking of the theme, though, the 1960 U.S. presidential campaign is interesting, but sufficiently foreign to this Canadian as to be imperfectly compelling.  As a consequence, I'm happy to play but probably won't insist on a game any time soon:  we'll see if that changes as I play more.

Addendum: after now played at least 12 games, I like and appreciate it more than ever. I was previously concerned that Issue battles would dominate, but in the long run that is not the case.

Four plays: I finally won a game after switching to the dark side. The theme didn't instantly grab me like Twilight Struggle did, but still very interesting.

At least! I manage to play it. I had to play it, so I didn't become discouraged even if noone in the room know its rules. But... there was a rule book so with one guy we very slowly started to play it. Then one guy showed up and he knew the game. We asked him couple of questions during a play, so most of the time we played it right. I feel it's a very good game. For sure I want to play it again. It's not luck based. It's challenging. Of course there was one rule than I didn't know till the end of a game. That at the end of the game You had to flip over state counters that you 'controlled' and then on the of the other side of these counters you had a number of the votes. So as you see... If I'd play it now I would know what to do better than in the first play :D

There is a great tension built into this game as you battle with your opponent over states. But the game can become frustrating when the cards come out in an order that leaves you with less than optimal moves.

so much effort for a slow moving tedious see-saw. I don't often feel this way about games, but it just feels kind of pointless. You put pieces, I take them away. repeat. At some point the turns run out, and like musical chairs, whoever is left in California and New York wins. The debates mini-game is a microcosm of the game, to me--almost completely pointless in effect, but takes so much effort. 

If it helps you weigh my opinion, I also can't stand Twilight Struggle and 1989.

f'n gorgeous, though, can't fault that production quality.

RATING: 8.5
The game works good in a "let's see what happens, if I do this" manner, provided that your opponent isn't too sure what he is supposed to do either. The overall feel I got was very good, the games were over very quick, once we came to the election. The feel of a presidential campaign is definitely there. The thing I am not too clear about yet is, how much card draw affects winning and loosing. With the right cards, you can devastate your opponent in no time, while wrong cards can lead to stagnation and frustration. It should level out during the 9 phases, but still. The middle of the game debate event seems a bit artificial. Nonetheless, very eager to play again in the near future.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Very good, but could be much better. 
Everyone involved with this game can be very proud - it's got a real board for one! I'm such a fan of the theme and they've done a pretty good job of making a fun game that's challenging and plays quickly to boot. A bit like El Grande for two in the USA - kind of, only much better than that sounds.

I don't think there's a better mechanism than the card driven one for adding theme to a boardgame.
The cards that add historical flavour have actions that are too uninspiringly similar. I'd prefer some objectives that'll reward a candidate if they travel to a specific state and take support for that state before a certain time or event. Objectives that the player can weigh the pros and cons for and decide whether they're worth the effort or risk. Currently the objectives are similar for each player, to do with leading an issue, or not leading an issue. The cards, as they stand, unfortunately just have too much mundane cube shuffling around.

***Confusing rule regarding when you perform support checks - State support NO, campaign points or the event gives you CP to use then YES. I personally think the game would be easier and better if support checks were required for ALL event cards and debate victories when used in a carried or candidate occupied state - media control would become more meaningful in the game.***

New GMT version with rules changes interests me enough to pick this one up and give it another go with the new rules. I'm especially interested in the optional rule for issues.

Very easy game mechanic in which players gain electoral suport based on the cards they play.  Nevertheless, paradoxically, at the same time it is hard to achieve a complete vision of the game and the best way to play due to the great number of cards and effects they have.  A good game to taste fully at its best after several plays.

This game highlights a dilemma I have:  If I play a game online, I'll probably get good at it.

And this one plays so quickly online while I don't get to play in person with a lot of people.

High degree of strategy, easy to teach and fast-paced, this CDG is a true peer of TS  (with major scoring/win condition changes) and that has its pros while the more luckless elements mitigate the cons - instead of nail-biting die-rolls, you control the political capital bag. Outstanding historical board and bits - even causal gamers will want to watch you play it as they're most likely voters and certainly familiar with 'the game' of a campaign as well as the map board. Wonderful concentration of gaming in the 1-2 hrs it takes especially if the gamers are too limited time-wise for anything longer or are semi-casual gamers / in the mood for something lighter.  The entire play is quite thematic and it seems that all the minor-choices scream for attention constantly.  Strategy also morphs each game I play and I pretty much only play with one other experienced player unfortunately.
I never find myself setting its status as 'Want to Play' but it seems to find table-time rather... obsessively.

Wow, what a fun game! The cards are great with a bit of history and their dual purpose (events or CPs) making for interesting decisions. Don't let the theme scare you off; the gameplay more than makes up for what many might consider an unattractive theme. You'll find yourself desperately trying to win over more states so that *you* can be president! :) The Issues part leading to momentum and endorsements seem a little overpowered perhaps...

Not swept away as much as I was by Twilight Struggle -- 1960 feels a little more mathy.  I admit it is more streamlined, but it may be that the bumps are what was most attractive about TS in the first place.  Still, an enjoyable two hours, and I will certainly play again.
[UPDATE] I never did play again. Not enough tension in the decisions.

I know a lot of people love this one, but I think I must not be into history enough. It just didn't seem that wonderful to me.  It had some tense decisions, but most of the time the card play seemed sort of obvious - don't play events that help your opponent if you can help it. In addition, I thought some of the cards (esp Momentum cards) were too powerful and added a lot of luck to the game.

Simple, straightforward yet epic game where you just try to do the best with the cards you're given, and it has a great theme to boot.

Basically just try to play your favorable cards as events if possible, and play others for Control Points, taking into account some things you want and don't want to happen through the resource of momentum. You gain momentum through Issues. Debates and Campaign Strategy add that twist to keep things interesting just when you thought things were getting repetitive. The design is simple, but makes for a very clean, satisfying game with agonizing choices.

The annoying thing is that the Debate rules are very annoying to teach to casual gamers who might have been suckered in by theme and clean gameplay otherwise. Some rule misunderstanding always seems to happen when you conduct the Debates (since they happen 1 hour into the game and there's no "taste" of them prior), then it becomes too late to undo the mistakes.

Also, Advertising seems very underpowered, which doesn't click thematically. Maybe make it so the leader in Advertising gets to switch issues before collecting momentum, not after.

UPDATE: And I'm another one of those who doesn't need to play this anymore after trying Twilight Struggle. The rules complexity is about the same, but the situations in TS are a brain-melter.

4+2

A great board game that tackles an interesting and original theme in a highly thematic manner without sacrificing meaningful gameplay. Truly a breath of fresh air, so fresh in fact that I really don't care if it's just a rehash of Twilight Struggle - gaming needs more innovators pushing the envelope like these guys do.

I love this game. Every day I hear another primary result, I'm ready to whip it out - I mean the game, of course. 

As I play it more, and we learn the cards in the deck, a new psychological element enters the game. When your opponent makes a move, you're wondering is he doing that because he has card X. It adds a new layer of depth and enjoyment to the game.

I really like Twilight Struggle.  This is kind of its little brother.  Sure there are some similarities, but there are also some significant differences.  The most obvious is that it plays a fair amount quicker.  It is not nearly as complex and the card play is much less interesting.  Still, it is a pleasant enough gaming experience on its own.

I played two times yesterday! What a fun game! The only problem I can see is with its replayability and perhaps scripting. The thing is that it's a good game, but I feel that a lot of cards will always be played in the same way. You will always see the same cards ending up in the election day event box. I think over time things will be so obvious (partly because the full deck is almost always played) that replayability might be a concern.

2/3/08 I played two more games last night, and altough I am still concerned about some of the ' automated' responses to specific cards, and other diversity issues; for the time being I love to play and so this game desirves its 9.

Edit 22 may 2009. It's still up there! The third game in my top 10! All things I feared in the previous post have not occured. Quite the contrary the game is turning more and more interesting the more times you play it. As long as you allow yourself to diversify in strategy.

29-08-2012: I've played this game so many times now. I don't think I will ever get bored of it. Sure, it has its weaknesses. But it is certainly not predictable or scripted. I don't believe there is a whole lot more to discover for me anymore. But what is there, is just so much fun to play.

To me this is the game of the year.  An absolutely heart-pounding experience, and how many games can you say that about?  Just when I'm feeling jaded, "1960:MoP" comes along to remind me of the fun and pure joy of a great game design.  The Momentum Markers and Rest Cubes are inspired ideas !  I finally got to play, thanks to a friend.  But can I find my own copy?  It appears to be completely sold out.  [Update:  11-02-07, got my own copy ... it seems to be easier to find now.]  And everybody ... please write Jason & Co. and urge them to create their own take on "History of the World" (or some epic, historically based world civ game) ... wouldn't that be fine? These are not just games, they are living history lessons, and "1960:MoP" made me want to put on a little powder-blue, pillbox hat.  I can hardly wait to find out where Jason will take us next.

Initial rating. One play. 

After soloing I found it rather dull, but 2 player game was really better than expected. It is as advertised: a tug of war. Tension was neat, complexity manageable. Not sure if there was a narrative, but atmosphere worked well. I really felt quite immersed for a relatively long 2 player game. However I have a suspicion further plays might show the game as samey. But I'll be willing to play again.

Played twice. The game is too finely balanced, repetitive, and long for the decisions you're making.

[10 plays] An excellent card driven political campaign game. As far as the comparison to Twilight Struggle, I'll say it is better in terms of ease of play and friendliness to newbies, not as good in terms of complexity and strength of theme, but so damn different for me that I'm glad I own both and I am resentful that some people are trying so hard to pigeonhole everyone into one camp or another. 

Each time I finish, I am already looking forward to the next game eagerly. I optimistically expect this game to do that to me time after time. The production is beautiful (the cards are almost too thick), the flow of the game is smooth, the thematic elements are strong, and there are strategic and tactical depths to explore as the hands of fate throw all kinds of crap at you.

I have lost with Nixon just once, won with him twice, and won all 3 games I have played with Kennedy.

Every time I have played with Nixon I feel like I am under the gun the whole time - used and abused - almost every powerful card against me. The way I have fought this is to try and dominate the momentum markers and do better in media and advertising. Give up on CA if necessary to fight for the all powerful NY, PA, OH area. I now consider playing Nixon to be the much bigger challenge.

Update April '14: everything I've said about this game previously still stands. Love it.

Most recent play June '17.

RATING: 7.5
Good 2-player game...even if the theme won't set the world on fire. It's twilight struggle-light minus the agony and tension of really using the cards for different purposes. The 'random' die rolls have been replaced by a cube-draw system and the game clips along at a nice rate. There are always things to do each turn but sometimes feels a little mechanical (battle for high-scoring states) and it seems like spending a card to hinder an opponent or to set yourself up for the next card play is not really worth the time and effort to do so. The debates mechanic is clever but a little bit of a let-down in execution (debates simply end up as a TS 'space-race' equivalent where people dump cards that help their opponents. The scoring at the end is also a little annoying.

The game will have its fans...those who haven't played TS or those who wan't a lighter, faster affair. It's not bad but I'd rather play TS.

Having to pretty much know all the cards makes the first games a rather tedious experience. Which might be the reason why I never made it beyond the first game.

By and large it seems to be the typical US election simulation game, based on an election system that by itself already appears more of an interesting game theory question rather than a reasonable system for finding out what people actually want. Accordingly, the game impressively proves that being barely above 50% in half of the states and not giving a damn about the rest is much better than being barely below 50% in *all* states. Which is somewhat depressing to someone who still tries to believe in democracy.

Either that, or the game simply doesn't quite get me. Too abstract for its theme I'd say, a bit too unpredictable, and maybe more complex than it would have to be.

You don't always need knights, dragons or spaceships for a good game. I studied international relations as my major in the university. Tricky Dick vs. JFK run for presidency in the 1960s is a superbly interesting setting for me. Campaigning in different states, counting your electoral votes and trying to thwart your opponents plans makes an entertaining, tight two player duel. I like how the cards have historical events & characters to really get the theme across to the players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
I've only played this once so far.  As Kennedy I ended up winning with 329 electoral votes to Nixon's 208.  However, the game was pretty close up until the 8th turn.  I drew both Nixon's Pledge and Nixon's Knee and won the initiative.  Naturally I went first and laid down the dual hex on Nixon as my first two phases for that turn.  This pretty much wrecked his last turn since he only had one momentum marker to start with.  

We basically chalked that up to being a freak occurrence of a draw.  There are 91 Campaign cards so the chances of Kennedy drawing them at the same time on the most critical juncture of the game are extremely low. 

Overall I was impressed with the depth of the game and I look forward to playing it again (hopefully without some weird rare combination of cards deciding the result).

Couple plays with my dad, playing as Kennedy - should be a little different as Nixon, but easily as enjoyable.  One of the highest ranked games for me because of the learning curve (easy to pick up), strategy factor, and the odds of the game being the same every time being low.  

Few more plays with Mrs. Lefty, all as Nixon, all wins.  I don't account for much, but I am usually able to support check good states at the end and I've been lucky against her.

Nagyon kíváncsi voltam a Twilight Struggle alapmechanizmusára épülő játékra, amelyik az 1960-as amerikai elnökválasztás témáját kapta. Személy szerint a téma engem nem tántorított el, érdekes az elektori választási rendszer a tengerentúlon. A játék kinézete szerintem teljesen rendben van, nekem tetszik, a kártyák is az adott kort idézik. Meglepett, hogy a fő mechanizmuson kívül - kártyák eseményként vagy akciópontra való felhasználása - szinte mindenben különbözik a TS-től. Ez abszolút jó pont, viszont ezek a különbözőségek szerintem általában rosszabbak, mint a nagy elődnél. Ami tetszett a fix körszám, a rövidebb játékmenet, a jobban tervezhetőség. Ami kevésbé az a szerencse szerepe. Meglepő módon ebben a játékban nincs kocka, mégis nagyobb a szerencse szerepe a TS-éhez képest. A fordulóban a kezdőjátékos eldöntése, a nagy befolyás csökkentése, a választáson a négy állam befolyása, stb. mind egy zsákból való kockahúzáson alapul véletlenszerűen. Persze a zsákban levő kockák számára van befolyásunk, de azért mégiscsak szerencse. A játék folyamán úgy éreztem nagyobb a kártyák eloszlásának szerepe is. Itt szerencsétlenebb esetben rosszabb helyzetbe kerülhet a játékos, mint a TS-ben rossz kártyák húzásakor. Érdemes a játékban tényleg mindenre figyelni, a három fő kérdéskör befolyásolása, a média vezetése és a sima kampányolás is mind-mind nagyon fontos. Külön fordulót kapó elnökjelölti vita fontosságát viszont kicsinek érzem, talán jobb az ellenfél erős lapjait ide felhasználni, mint kijátszani játék közben. Magánál a kampányolásnál is jobbnak érzem a TS-beli szomszédos befolyásolás lehetőségét. Nem rossz játék az 1960, de a TS számomra jobb, hogy mennyivel azt egy játék után nehéz megítélnem. Most egy ponttal adok csak kevesebbet neki, de elképzelhető, hogy a pontszám csökkeni fog még egyet, annál viszont semmiképp nem rosszabb, azaz aki a témát kedveli és kétszemélyes játékra vágyik annak bátran ajánlhatom. 

[2011-07-01]
Sajnos a továbbra is csak azt mondhatom nagy a szerencse szerepe, az utolsó forduló is túl sokat számít. Sokkal jobb a TS játékon belüli pontozása. Itt minden csak a végén dől el, ami nagyrészt a szerencsén múlik. Valószínűleg még 1 értéket csökkenni fog a pontszám.

[2012-02-25]
Az utolsó négy lap továbbra is vesszőparipám, de most már véglegesnek érzem a pontszámot. Eggyel kevesebb, mint a TS, mert cserében rövidebb és így tolerálhatóbb a nagyobb szerencsefaktor.

[i]A Cube Pusher that Makes you FEEL Like You're a Campaign Planner for the Presidential Race... But Kinda Sucks If You've Played Twilight Struggle[/i]

killer setting for a board game -- remarkable sense of time and place. However, the gameplay feels waaay too tit for tat (reversing what the other player does constantly makes you feel both piss weak which is boring), and it is a bit too easy to play your hand compared to the tense Twilight Struggle -- 

I don't think Momentum system really works that well in practice, the "movement" is a joke, etc. so the advantages and cool things it has on paper over TS don't really matter.

Masterfully done election game.  Full of color, thematic integration and taught excitement.  It really has you on the edge of your seat for most of the game.  I wish I could give it a higher rating, but I just despise the debate so much that I can't do it in good conscious.  Outside of the debate being too inflexible to suit my tastes (two cards to end this is irritating with simultaneous reveals), it relies on proper card draws earlier on in the game to be effectual.  I feel that even planned for it can go sour too easily causing a huge swing in cubes.  I understand this is thematically accurate so I grant them that.  My real gripe though is that it is shunted into the heart of the game, forcing a whole different mechanic that feels completely out of place.  You have to move to a different board and play out a whole different scenario.  Like some weird mini-game.  I'd rather just concede the entire debate than to bother actually playing it.

Still the rest of the game is so brilliant, that I forgive it.

It does kind of suck that they didn't put enough cubes in the game to actually play it as you are supposed to.

RATING: 2
I understand how this game is rated so high, but I just can't get over how it really just isn't very fun.  It has some interesting mechanics, and I love how it is card-driven.  However, there are some key flaws: the debates are underwhelming, as it's really the advantage of maybe one extra card.  The issues generally are taken over initially and then rarely challenged.  The key states are really the only ones to fight over, and extra points are offered on the other ones.

Overall, the main issue is that the theme falls very flat for me.  I don't get the sense that I'm campaigning, as I can't keep track of whether I'm losing or winning at the polls.  Instead, I fight for area control in a few states and then hope that the final tally which is long and time-consuming results in a victory.  By contrast, Twilight Struggle has all the card-driven goodness plus the immediate feedback of where you stand by having a victory track.  Last but not least, I never feel the sense of accomplishment that I got something done, like finally getting a ship built in Le Havre or winning a scoring round in TS.  Simply put, this was disappointing, not fun, and I spent the two hours I played it wishing just about anything else was on the table.

Not quite as good as Twilight Struggle. The momentum rules for triggering or pre-empting events cause fewer events to be played, which to me is less fun. Me like events. The mechanism of the draw bag and the rest tokens is neat, though. Debate night is nice, too. Good for a change-of-pace.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
1960 is similar to Twilight Struggle, with some key differences. All cards have events. When an opponent plays your card for Campaign Points, the event only happens if you spend a momentum disk (obtained by leading in some key issues at the end of each round; and also from some cards). Any event that occurs sends that card out of the game. There's some randomness, with issues resolved by drawing cubes out of the bag. But you can affect that randomness by choosing to play cards for CP (which adds some cubes to the bag). You have to consider several areas on the board: regions, states, advertising, endorsements, issues. You have to prepare for a debate (choose which card to set aside each round) and finally for the elections. There are a lot of tough choices throughout; should play well once you actually know the rules!

After a couple of plays, I think I prefer Twilight Struggle. The constant back-and-forth scoring in TS adds a lot of tension to the game -- I miss that in 1960, where I feel like I'm just sort of floating along reacting to the other player, and then bam! the end is here and you see how you did. The bag works OK, but I like the Battle Bag in End of the Triumvirate better; somehow, the more limited use of the bag in EotT is easier to wrap my head around.

--- 
After a few more plays, I'm certain: I strongly prefer TS -- 1960 is sold!

The mechanics all interrelate to produce an epic gaming experience that I can't stop thinking about.  Update:  I have played it again, two more times, and it now ranks as one of my favorite games (despite the fact that I lost both of those games).  Further update:  have finally found some other good election games, including Campaign Manager, and I think I like that system even better since it reduces game time without sacrificing strategy.

I love this game.  Extremely well designed.  Absolutely thematic and beautifully designed board.  Very interesting card mechanic.  The number of options of where to place your cubes confuses my wife but she likes the card mechanic.  I don't see me ever trading this one away though it might not get a lot of plays with me and her.  When my oldest daughter gets older this will see many more plays.

It was a blast. We played it on January 20 for the symbolic value. I really like Twilight Struggle and this was almost as good. Twilight struggle have a theme that´s more my cup of thé but 1960 had a great feel to it the whole way through. Everything did feel like a election. Both my opponent and I made many tactical mistakes during the game but Nixon (me) succeed to win because of some southern electors voting on another democratic candidate than Kennedy. With some more plays I think this grown to a 9 for me, or if the replayability is low, an 8.

I bought this hoping it would be a good substitute for Twilight Struggle but shorter and without the dice influence.  After one play, I was impressed but after a couple more plays it feels like you don't have very meaningful choices.  How you play a card (Event or Points) seems quite obvious.  Given the choice, I'd rather play something else.

Love the game and want to play it again very soon. Although the theme isn't as interesting as in TS, at least for someone at this side of the Atlantic, the game play is much more enthusiastic than TS. The flow of the game is excelent, it can be played in 90 minutes or less and, with some "American Geopolitical Learning" the strategy could be excelent. Main difference between this one and TS is that you have control over the entire game because scoring is equal for both players. Both players only score at the end of the game and none of them has scoring cards in hand which makes it much more fair. So it seems.

I think that the replayability is not very high and the interest in playing it becomes lower after a couple of plays. A good game though.

RATING: 8
When this is great, this is really really great! The card mechanic and to-ing and fro-ing and slugging it out for the big states, combined with momentum and advertising give this a really smooth feel where most (if not all) actions make sense, and the real sense of the history of the election comes through thanks to the actions on the cards (even the cards you don't use as actions get read and add to the feeling that you're in 1960 USA in the middle of an election). 

The two things that don't elevate this to even higher scores are:

1. Playtime - even though after the first couple of plays we can knock off a game pretty quickly now, it's still not a game we can pull out every evening, and doesn't honestly get much of a look in in the rotation.

2. On a semi-related note, after such a long playtime, it's felt a couple of times that it's all equal to the end (which def. help add to the tension throughout) but then the whole game is decided on the drawing of a final cube to see if a certain state swings or not. 

Despite not getting it to the table often enough, and the slight anti-climax you can feel at the end, this really is a cracker, I think.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fantastic production. rules are well written, the interaction of the cards is very clear and the game builds to a gripping climax. The Momentum marker premeption and activation of event cards is clever - a lesson learnt form TS?
One downer is that, in the first few plays, it's not easy to tell who is leading before election day. A major difference with TS is that this game goes the full 9 turns, which means it may be possible for the last few turns to be redundant if one player is miles ahead. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Very good game, rating marred only by some extreme luck possibilities.  (Getting the cards "Swing State" in the final round can be devastating, for example - there goes NY ...)  Still, it's much better than Twilight Struggle, and an enjoyable game, recommended.  Edit: I just dropped my rating a notch after further play.  There really *is* too much luck in the cards.  Still fun, though.

Have played this twice now and I think I've had my fill.  To be honest, I didn't enjoy playing 1960 much.  I feel a little guilty rating it on that criteria, but since I do it with other games, I should here, too.  There's a couple reasons I hesitate and even rated 1960 higher at first: first, I think it's one of those games where the first couples times are pretty much bound to be a bit of a struggle, where you spend the game trying to get the flow rather than focusing more on strategy and enjoyment; second, it's incredibly well-done and deserves to be recognized for being a great game of its type, even if it isn't -my- type of game.  That all said and told, though, it ends up being an somewhat unenjoyable affair for me, because I don't like the give-and-take this game affords.

Z-man did a fantastic presentation job with this game.  Everything looks just right; they managed to make the board interesting despite the fact that it's largely just a map of the U.S. (they even put a fake coffee mug ring on it to make it look like some sort of political war-room map).  The bits and cards are all high-quality, the little factoids on the cards are interesting.  A+ design here.

And the mechanics are really quite interesting and amazing.  The draw bag has that "mysterious game piece of power" feel to it, like the cube tower from Shogun or the Sauron die in Lord of the Rings.  You learn to respect and fear it.  The game -feels- thematically correct; there's never enough time to do everything, and it's a brutal tug-of-war for the states with the most electoral clout.  There's some mechanics that didn't click as well with me--like the momentum markers--but at least part of that is still my only vague grasp of how to play the game well. 

Despite all this, I just get the feeling it's not really a game I'll ever really enjoy.  It's essentially an incredibly rough war/area-control game where you fight claw and nail for every inch of progress.  I find games where everything you've done on your turn can be (and often is) flatly reversed by the opponent on their following turn (this was my problem with Coloretto Amazonas).  It's thematically appropriate here, but it's frustrating for me to spend two or three turns trading cubes on New York.  Maybe that would happen a bit less if I were more experienced--maybe I'd learn to focus attention on other things where my opponent wouldn't thwart me as much, I don't know--but as it was I felt like I barely kept the status quo for most of the game.  

Anyhow, short version: this game is amazingly designed and presented and you should give it at least a shot.  But, personally, it's not my type of game.

I really had fun playing this game.  Funny thing is I lost pretty handily, but don't think I made any large errors,  which concerns me that "it could be all about the card draws".  Regardless I enjoyed playing the game immensely, and since I don't play on playing this until it's been played out, I'll just enjoy the few chances I have to play this.

I lost as Nixon in my second game as well. It's important to note that Nixon starts off with far fewer electoral votes than Kennedy, so he has some ground to make up. You have to do more than just capture the big states (which I did) to win.

Nearly flawless (issues a bit too strong, media a bit too weak) design that is a cousin (twice removed) of GMT's phenomenal Twilight Struggle. Easy to learn, easy to play, yet has surprising depth. Evocative, and captures the election campaign so very well. The more I play this game (25+ plays), the more I want to go again - it takes you along for quite an enjoyable ride.

RATING: 6
One of the best two player games I've played. An area majority game combined with card play.

Had a really awful game of this. Lost horribly as Kennedy. My opponent just produced wonder card after wonder card. I was playing 2cp cards on the whole. He won the issues, the endorsements, the media and just had so many cubes on the board it was unreal. Of course all those cubes in the bag from playing lots of 2cp cards also meant I played first each round.

Hence my reduction to a 6 as I've realised that luck can play such a large part, much like Twilight Struggle.

Like it, don't love it yet.  Prefer twilight struggle.Might be missing a couple things, I'll admit, but media control seems very minor, making it a two front battle with luck of draw controlling a lot in terms of the better events.Also, don't feel the theme as much as I do when playing Twilight Struggle, the game shines through a little more in this game.  Certainly worth owning for the shorter play time than most games in this genre.

[u]Key Words:[/u] Political - Card Driven - 2-player - Tit-for-Tat - 2h

[u]Summarized Opinion:[/u] Nice if somewhat frustrating game, good production, does a great job to reflect the theme. In the end, not satisfying.

[u]My Rating Explained:[/u] Ok game, will play sporadically if in the right mood.

[u]Verbose Assessment:[/u]

There's a few things that just don't sit right with me to give this game a higher rating.

The first is the impact of the cards on the gameplay. Basically, what cards you get and how you play them will win or lose you the game. While this is true of some games I rate a 10, in this game it annoys me. For one thing, every card has an event that's mostly negative for one of the players. If you're stuck with a hand full of cards that are good for your opponent, you will be in for a rough turn. It's possible to somewhat play around this effect using momentum, but only to a degree.

The second major thing I dislike about this game is the general flow of the game. The turns before the debates are essentially one big soup. It depends what both players choose to emphasize, bit it's entirely possible for an important state to swing wildly from one side to the other multiple times in a couple turns. In effect, your entire turn can theoretically be undone in a single turn of your opponent. Tit for tat, and to me, somewhat frustrating. Especially since in the end, that important state tends to be decided by some powerful event one of the players happened to draw.

Finally, the drawbag. It's an interesting, new-to-me mechanism, but I'm not sure I like it. In my first game, I lost by a hair because New York was recounted (ie, the draw bag went my opponent's way). The second, I lost by a hair because I failed to draw the majority out of the bag during a similar event. Both games could have gone either way.

In short, I'm sure a good player will win consistently against an inexperienced one, but the whole experience just feels frustrating and kinda pointless to me.

To end on a positive note: once the debates are over, the game is exciting and builds to a climax as the votes are tallied.

Unlike its brother, 1960 plays oddly. There's a handful of important states (take Illinois to New Jersey and you're more or less set) and the binary nature of influence means there's a lot of back and forth. 

"Gathering Momentum" cards seem strangely game-defining. Get two in your early hand, and I imagine your opponent will sweat blood. I also miss the variable score times. We all know when the scoring will take place, who's got what and how that'll play out. No bluffing through this one. 

The choice of "momentum" is interesting, but removes some of the "how do I handle this" aspect that TS has.

RATING: 7
This could have been an absolutely fantastic game but it is flawed in a few too many areas. It's production values are of the highest standard with excellent components, artwork etc, and the cards, which depict the major events of the respective presidential campaigns, provide interesting decisions and add to the theme brilliantly. On the downside however I feel that there's too much emphasis on the campaign actions where you increase state support by placing your cubes into various states. This feature of the gameplay is over-emphasised at the expense of the other options available to you, such as increasing media or issue support. The debate phase mechanics don't work as well as they should (placing cards of differing values against the campaign's three main issues in order to win the debate on them) and the benefits for being successful in this area (gaining a small amount of state support cubes) are too minimal to really feel as though they're having a significant impact on the game. There's much to admire here but the overall result is slightly underwhelming.

I love the back-and-forth, the battle for New York, the vindictive cards and the multiple methods to influence states.

Update: Having just played this again after a while, I love the tense finishes and the tough choices over which cards to bury and which to play (and sometimes block).

Update 2: Playing this with different opponents every time, it is interesting to see people try out different strategies; whether they fight over New York, the issues or move around the board and try to pick up other areas.

The back-and-forth does now seem to be a little zero-sum and you can spend entire turns just undoing what your opponent has just done.

Rating down from 7.9 to 7 as this seems to take just a little longer than it really should.

Ultimately traded for £25 as I just can't see it getting played.

RATING: 7
I'm a little concerned with the obvious slant of most of the cards. There are pro-Nixon, anti-Nixon, pro-Kennedy and anti-Kennedy cards. If I get my opponent's good cards or my own bad cards, then I don't have much to do in the way of burying it. I can put it in the debate, which usually means it helps them, or block it with two momentum tokens. Those aren't easy to come by, so getting dealt a whole hand of these in a turn will just be a huge help to your opponent. Given equal momentum, I can block one or two of these and they can execute the rest of the actions since it takes two of them to block and one to execute an event on an opponent's card. So, we can say that these card will even out, but then I can't conserve my momentum for these situations. For some reason the game makes me lose some of them if I don't use them. So you can explain these crappy card and momentum situations with a thematic explanation that the people running your campaign weren't doing there job.

If we start talking about theme, it seems wrong that the players are fighting over non-swing states. There's no way to lock anything down in this game so that it's not under threat anymore, so players might be fighting over Illinois and making multiple visits that don't really happen in elections. It makes a more interesting game, but doesn't work with the theme. So that's where some of the game goes wrong. It's got good potential, but it doesn't know if it wants to be a theme-game or a game-game and it mixes the two in ways that make you dislike the short-comings of each side.

RATING: 6
I love TS, and so I really wanted to love this game too, since many of the mechanics are the same, and the theme appeals to me (although not nearly so much as TS).  But after a few plays, 1960 proves itself to be a much more one-dimensional game.  For those who griped about having to play their opponent's event cards in TS, yes, you can avoid triggering your opponent's events with momentum, and your opponent has to have momentum to spend even if you do play a card with one of his events, but there are many more events that are devastating to your position out of proportion to the value of the card, especially since many of them allow the play of influence anywhere, making damage control all but impossible, and hands filled with your opponents events devastating (unlike TS, where all but the very worst hands are actually quite manageable).  So the game naturally turns into a war over momentum, which means that the game turns into a tug-of-war over the issues.  The difficulty limiting the effect of your opponent's events is augmented by the fact that you effectively have to play all of the ones you get during the first five turns, since you must save cards with your own events, or neutral events, to play in the debates (unless you pick one issue to lose on, early - but that's a tricky and dangerous strategy).  And, lastly, what sticks in my craw the most - the debates don't have any effect on issue support!

This isn't a bad game, by any stretch, but I found it rather disappointing in comparison to TS.  The production values are beautiful, and it may be an even better 'crossover' game for non-gamers or Euro-gamers to get into CDGs.

Update: I really wanted to like this game much more than I do.  I started out rating it a 6, which after a few plays I felt was too harsh, and slowly raised my rating to 7.  But after playing a bit more, I have to say that there's really not much depth here, and while I like its good points less, I loathe its problems more.  I blow hot and cold on this one.

Wow et wow encore. Quel jeu! Le thème me rejoint beaucoup plus que Twilight Struggle et il est beaucoup moins intimidant (beaucoup plus évident de visualiser la carte des USA que la carte du monde). J'ai déjà hâte d'y rejouer! Et le matériel est de belle qualité. Une réussite sur toute la ligne :-)

This is definitely a fun game that spent too much time on my shelf and not enough time on the table.  A great 2 player game with a lot of choices.  A great themed game with a nice tie-in to history with two of the more intriguing presidents of the modern times.

Decent game.  Very well thought out several nice mechanics to capture the various aspects of the campaign (debates, events, media, endorsements, etc.). 

 I think it suffers in comparison to Twilight Struggle.  In TS their is a much higher anxiety/tension factor because you are forced to fire your opponents events with much greater frequency.  In 1960 it is very easy to  avoid events you don't like.  Also, 1960 seems to heavily favor the player who goes last in the final "regular" turn.

Neat, I like it a lot. Flows nicely and is playable in under two hours. I believe the game is quite balanced, there are good cards equally for both sides.

It's the kind of game where I guess it's not really fair that I can't evaluate it in a vacuum.  That is, I don't know where I'd peg 1960 in a world that didn't have Twilight Struggle.  The two really are that similar, and Twilight is just so much better.  1960 lacks Twilight's immediacy.  It only has one scoring round, which is obviously appropriate to the theme, but that feature really is a drag on the game.  There's no hurry to do anything, so you just run around wherever you want doing whatever's easiest.  You'll seldom see any tough decisions here.

RATING: 8.5
Often by the same people who have called it a really good game, I will hear Twilight Struggle's weaker sister. I would tend to agree.  Very similar gameplay mechanics, however the tension that makes TS so great doesn't quite translate.  I believe this is due to the fact that their are no immediate victory conditions.  Don't let that fool you though, this game like TS requires you to maximize the cards you are dealt if you hope to win the Presidency. One mistake by you will often be enough to swing the election in the other direction.

Just keep in mind.  TS's weaker sister could still be a lot of other games stronger brother.

The more I play TS, the more I think I won't play this much more.  Not a bad game but doesn't contain the never ending tension from start to finish like TS does.  This mostly comes from no immediate loss conditions which could add a little more tension.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The bits are excellent, the mechanics are balanced, and the theme is...  a little light.  We all remember Nixon's lazy shave, but what about the rest of two full decks of 50 year-old events?  Most are not nearly as compelling; some are nearly gossip.  1960 is a fine, balanced game that lacks the charisma of a global battle for power (see Twilight Struggle).  If you want a war game for people who say they don't like war games, this one sneaks completely under the radar.

I played this a ton during the 2008 campaign. Lots of fun and tough choices, good tension, and gives you a great "inside" view of 1960 politics. One of the most streamlined card-driven games out there, you can bring this one out for non-hardcore gamers. Once you've played this a few times, graduate to Twilight Struggle.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is a game that will get many non-gamers intrested due to the theme. Make no mistake about it, this game is a stradegy game. It takes atleast one play through to understand which cards to save for later use. Some of the mechanics in the game have little value and should have been removed from the game. A good game that feels like it was rushed out before the testing could perfect all the mechanics. All the basic mechanics work great and you will soon realize that many of the "neat" sounding actions you can take during your turn have little to no value. The game still plays great, just remember to stick to the meat and potatoes.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
An enjoyable game, but not nearly on par with Twilight Struggle in terms of decision tension (I think largely because of how scoring is done in each game).  Media presence seems fairly unimportant for the most part as well.

Still, it's a very good game that I think does a pretty decent job of feeling like an election campaign.  The aesthetic is very well done.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
It is very refreshing to have a game every now and then that is not just mechanic A through C with some wild theme pasted onto it. I love it when you see the love for the detail and you can actually learn a little something about history while gaming. A lot of research must have gone into this gem. Concerning gameplay: it is very tense. You always want to do more than you can. You never want to give your opponent the chance of a momentum, but sometimes you just have to. 

First game is bound to take much longer, because you will keep going through the text of the cards, not only the one relevant for the game itself but also the historical flavour notes. What's more: the artwork is simply amazing. It has a very authentic 60s touch and is very stylish.  

Hopefully I’ll get a lot more chances to play this. On a different note I have to complain about the quality of the wooden cubes. What’s up with that? Even before the first game the coloring is washing off. I was afraid to pick up those cubes cause I feared it would color off and turn my hands all red and blue. Fortunately it didn’t. Still with more plays coming in I am not sure the cubes won’t turn blank. 

Record: 0-3 (Kennedy losing to Nixon 235-302) 
            (Kennedy losing to Nixon 200-337)
            (Kennedy losing to Nixon 204-333)
--------------------------------------------------
Update: Well, what can I say? I was so convinced that this is a great game but then this? Mind you, I'm nobody who is concerned about luck too much in games but then this...  from the third round on I was thinking there wasn't much I could do. And I couldn't. I was utmost destroyed by 337-200 with no chance at all. I need to play again to see if I only had a really, really bad swing of luck but otherwise I'm not so sure about balance in this one.
-------------------------------------------------
*sigh* Once again! But I think we are playing a rule wrong. Next time, I will play with the variant I think is correct, making the game as we play it now the variant.

A really excellent election simulator, with solid incorporation of the history behind it. Set up and scoring take a lot of time, but the former can be helped by not setting out the state seals and the latter with the scoring tool available from BGG.

I wouldn't want to play it often, because it would get repetitive, but every once in a while it's really fun.

RATING: 7
I really wanted to wait until I played it a bit more, but I could not hold back rating it after a single play.  The game is incredibly balanced, offering players an immersive and engaging experience.  The game bleeds narrative, as you can literally tell a story as you play the game.  I believe that Twilight Struggle is a deeper and more rewarding game, but 1960 brings a more user friendly format, less war-ish rules and plays more briskly than TS.  I would play either any day, any time, any place.  The only strikes I see so far are that it can be tough to find a 2-player opponent, and there is a shortage of cubes nearly every game.

Similar enough to Twilight Struggle that I quickly felt at home, but with its own twists and quirks.  In general, I'd say it's more chaotic and quick than TS, as well as less tense and a little less aggressive.  No strong preference here -- both are wonderful additions to my library.  

Thanks to my Secret Santa '09 for hooking me up!

Not a bad game but has a few fiddly rules that I'm not crazy about. Probably a better game than Twilight Struggle overall as it gets rid of the dice-rolling and streamlines the gameplay a little.

Also, now that 13 Days: The Cuban Missile Crisis is out, that game is now my go-to for this type of game. 13 Days has the same great CDG gameplay but plays in 30-40 minutes.

Great game, really captures the feel of a tightly-fought election.  The multiple functions of the campaign cards make each turn a series of difficult decisions and make for intense competition.  Can lose some historical feeling with more plays as you can ignore the flavour text and just play cards for their mechanical value but we play it rarely enough that this doesn't much happen.  Nixon has won 13 out of the 16 games I've played.

A bit too much luck.  Momentum and advertising aren't very useful, and endorsements which are critical are even more random.  Fun, but not great.

I was very excited to learn this game with my wife. I was sure it would be a favorite of hers. And while I was right that she liked it, I can't say she loved it like I thought she would. It was good--don't get me wrong. But it was missing something. Exactly what? I don't know. We'll have to play it again soon to try and figure it out. Or perhaps it will turn out that we just needed to give it a couple plays to get it down and fully enjoy it.

Beautiful, engaging and fun both from the historical and elections horse race angle.

The necessity of having to learn the cards in order to play well makes this one a bit of a commitment to bring a new player up to speed makes this one harder to get to the table regularly for me.

I find the game almost too intense sometimes, which can hinder my enjoyment. I realize that this is MY problem, not the game's.



Suitability for Travel:

Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 1
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 2

Have yet to play; purchased right before we purchased a house and moved - no time for games.  Finally, have started playing more games after settling in and we love this game.  It has a great balance of strategy and randomness (with cards and "checks" with cubes).  I love the strategy, but my husband prefers the random factor so we get a perfect mix.

RATING: 7.75
This is my favorite lengthy two-player.  The details of the thematic integration, the potential impact of swing states on election day, and the variety of play options make for a fantastic game.  Some of the cards seem crazy powerful, but not enough to keep one side from winning the election.   The turn of events and wild finishes still surprise me after 10 plays.  

UPDATE: My interest in playing this has cooled a little, but my respect for the design hasn't.  Hoping to use the structure as a teaching tool for investigating another election someday.

Letter Grade: B.  Does what it does well, but the same design system is already on full display in Twilight Struggle.  Still, the shorter gameplay makes it more accessible. [05-08-09]

After about a half-dozen plays (02-15-09): This has hit the table more times in a shorter period than many of the longer boardgames I own.  Chalk it up to: reasonable playing time; accessible theme and strategy; relatively forgiving system that isn't too hard to explain; thematic immersion.  The similarities between this and Twilight Struggle should not be denied, but I'm very happy to own both.  Is TS the "better" (read: thinkier, more heavyweight, more thematic) game?  Probably.  But I can actually squeeze a game of 1960 in on a weeknight.  Because most people just "get" what is important to win the presidency this game remains very accessible, and is a great introduction to the mechanics of card-driven games.

I very solid Twilight Struggle light.

The political capital bag is a nice replacement for die rolls as it gives the players some level of control over the outcome of a "randomizer".

Good game that falls short of great.  Very well balanced.  Lots of tension and agonizing decisions.  I also have some problem with a game of this length often coming down to a 50/50 draw from the bag at the end, even though it is thematically right to be on the edge of your seat waiting to see what happens with those election day support checks.  A fantastic implementation of the theme.

All that said, it pales in comparison to Twilight Struggle for me.  Some of this is due to the limitations imposed by the theme -- the scoring is necessarily at the end in 1960 while TS is more flexible and interesting.  But also, 1960 feels more like a back-and-forth tug of war (I add a cube, then you remove it), while TS feels much more dynamic.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
A great card driven game which is essentially concerned with area control. A clever mechanic allows you to trigger an event on your opponent's card by paying a momentum marker. Obviously, most of the game is spent fighting over the states which are worth the big points (NY, Massachusetts etc.). My first game was won by the Nixon player after he played a card which deducted -2 CP points from all Kenedy cards (on the last turn, of course). This gave him New York and the game. 1960 forces you to make difficult decisions every turn and is tension remains until the very end. It's no Twilight Struggle, but I did really enjoy the first play and will definitely be revisiting 1960 in the near future.

Comment after games 1-4: It really is a ton of fun.  It really boils the CDG mechanic and makes it quite approachable.  The hand management in this game is quite interesting.  So many considerations to assess, in the procedure of planning out your hand.   The debates is a whole mini sub game in itself, which is an enjoyable thing to hash out.  One play in.

This is the greatest theme ever.  I have had two non gamers very interested in playing this game because of the theme.  There is something magical about this time period, the election, and the two men running for office, at least for many Americans.  

Comment after 5 games:
Disappointing game with a great theme. It lost steam quickly. It held about 5 plays.  I don't see myself playing it again.

Every time I play, I sit there daydreaming about having more fun playing Twilight Struggle.  They are different but its something I have noticed.

RATING: 6
SOLD (5/11/09) --- I think this game may be mechanically better than Twilight Struggle, but still not as enjoyable.  I really like two of the gameplay improvements in 1960 over Twilight Struggle.  First, the momentum markers for triggering events are a great addition.  Second, using the political capital bag rather than dice is a great change.  However, the lack of mid-game scoring in 1960 removes the tension and excitement that pervades Twilight Struggle.  In addition, the components of 1960 are also a good deal nicer than Twilight Struggle.  In the end though, 1960 just isn't nearly as tense as Twilight Struggle and feels a bit more leisurely since you know there won't be any scoring until the very end of the game.  I'm already looking forward to the third game in the series, hoping that combines the mid-game scoring of Twilight Struggle with the momentum markers and political capital bag mechanics from 1960... only time will tell.

Solid CDG game for 2players. Comparations to TStruggle are inevitable. IMHO both are fine each one in his class: TS is a more complex, longer and with more angst decisions. 1960 is a mid-weight, shorter (120 min, which is very important for me) and more accesible for non-gamers and more fiance friendly. I enjoy it a lot with my gf. 

I like playing with some house rules to make issues 'war', advertising and carrying states more interesting, with these small changes my rate is 8.5.

Nice components, and very playable.  It helps to have been there and lived through that history, or at least to have been old enough to vaguely remember the politics of the day, though not essential.  A favorite 2 player. There is a lot of banter about which is better, 1960 or Twilight Struggle.  They are obviously very similar in overall game play, and they both represent their theme probably more accurately than any other games on the market, so I don't see any reason to set one above the other. Twilight Struggle gets the nod probably because one American Presidential election seems relatively insignificant next to the totality of the Cold War. Still, it is Top Notch!

"In 1960: The Making of the President, you take on the role of one of these great protagonists vying for the right to lead his country into the heart of the Cold War. However, it is not just foreign policy that poses a challenge to American leadership; this is also an era of great social turmoil and progress. As the United States continues to build upon the promise of its founding, candidates must contend with the question of civil rights and balance their positions on social justice against the need for valuable Southern electoral votes. Of course, the ever-present issue of the economy also rears its ugly head, and both Nixon and Kennedy will compete to be the candidate with the voters' pocket books in mind.

"Sometimes the history of a nation can be defined by the relationship between two individuals. The Election of 1960 is the story of two men, John F. Kennedy and Richard M. Nixon. One is the scion of a wealthy, politically powerful family from New England. The other is the son of a Quaker grocer in Whittier, California. While they belong to opposing political parties, they start out as friends. The complex development of that friendship, however, would shape a pivotal presidential election and cast a long shadow over American history for the remainder of the 20th century.

Of course, the ever-present issue of the economy also rears its ugly head, and both Nixon and Kennedy will compete to be the candidate with the voters' pocket books in mind.

"The contest is fought out on an electoral map of the United States as it stood in 1960—a map where Louisiana and Florida share the same number of electoral votes, as do California and Pennsylvania. Using a card-driven game system, all the major events which shaped the campaign are represented: Nixon’s lazy shave, President Eisenhower’s late endorsement, and the 'Catholic question' are all included as specific event cards. The famous televised debates and final election day push are each handled with their own subsystems. Candidates vie to capture each state’s electoral votes using campaign points in the four different regions of the country. At the same time, they must build momentum by dominating the issues of the day and attempt to gain control of the airwaves.

"As with any election campaign, the challenge is to adapt your game plan as the ground shifts out from under you. There are never enough resources or time to do everything, but you need to make the tough calls to propel yourself into the White House. This fast-playing strategy game for two players challenges you to run for the most powerful elective office in the world, at one of its most unique crossroads. Will you recreate history, or rewrite it? 1960: The Making of the President provides you the opportunity to do both."

I probably prefer 1960 to Twilight Struggle because it has fewer rule exceptions and complications. The momentum markers and bag mechanics make for a great game. However, there is a see-saw nature to the game that some people won't like (eg player A places cubes in a state and player B then removes such cubes - this could go back and forth).

July 2016: Sold on Geek Market.

Initial impressions back in 2008: Great game. It's not Twilight Struggle, but the different theme and slight rule changes make this a great addition to my collection.

Update June 2016: My enjoyment of this game has steadily decreased the more I play Twilight Struggle. I like the election theme, but the gameplay and events don't excite me as much as the Cold War.

Twilight Struggle has NATO, the Cuban Missle Crisis, a Defcon track that can cause nuclear war, and an easier way to continuously keep score, which constantly reminds you how close you are to losing. 1960 on the other hand has a lot of boring events, a less harsh way of dealing with negative events, a debate round in the middle of the game that feels largely out of place, and no way to know how you're doing unless you can keep 50 numbers in your head or use an amazing app (available in the files section) that makes keeping score way easier, and allows a bit more campaign strategy.

Conclusion: A lighter version of Twilight Struggle, and a great game for politics fans. Game would be way better if they released a new deck and map after each US election, that way the events would be more up to date.

Wowzers, this is an unbelievably fun game. I played it online once at GTO with a patient gamer and I have to say this game is quite amazing. I haven't had a fun gaming session for a very long time now and this one really turned heads.

I love the multitude of ways one can distribute the resources around, especially the tussle for battleground states. I love how the issues in our hand play a role in shaping the debates, very elegant and thematically very solid.

Above all else the election day end game condition is amazingly tight and very tense. Can really swing the game around for some major swing states. 

Amazing game!

After 1 play:  I like it a lot and would love to play it to death, if only I could find time and opponents.  It does lack some of the absolutely gut-wrenching tension that I felt playing TS, but it still does possess plenty of hard decisions and a healthy dose of that "never enough" feeling.  I may adjust my rating down or up after a few more plays, but right now, "Probably I'll suggest it and I'll never turn down a game!"

Initial rating after three plays. I'm liking this game. I haven't played Twilight Struggle or Die Macher so I can't say if it is shallow. What I can say is that I love the historical background that has been included and the tense nature of the game. There is a lot of subtle strategy that goes on that can easily be missed if you just go through the motions. I love the uncertainty about the game as well. You really don't know if you've got the presidency in the bag until things are all said and done because of the swings in the game. Does that make it a bit chaotic and random and defeat sound strategy at times? Well, welcome to politics!

1960 is losing some of it's appeal for me. Candidates hardly move because too many events are being played and campaigning is costly. To me it seems that the man with the better cards, especially in turns 7 and 8, will win. Will play again, but not soon.

Nixon vs. Kennedy 1960 election reenacted in a card-driven area-control game. Highly immersive and oozing with an historically well-researched theme. Sides are much more balanced than its sibling game, Twilight Struggle. Plays in about 1-2 hours. I really enjoy this when in the mood for a longer 2 player game with good depth. Plus I'm generally fascinated with the American electoral process - and I absolute love the way the story unfolds during the game and the tension that comes along with it!

The theme for this is more palatable than Twilight Struggle.  I still don't know why that should be so important, maybe it's because I was around for the cold war but not 1960.  There's also something I like better about the board play than TS which seems unnecessarily fiddly.

The board play is still a bit off, but mainly in comparison to the actual election process and issues.  And it is another giant deck of cards to learn.

Good balance, fun theme.

Compared to other card-driven games, 1960 event cards are generally more powerful and broad, allowing strong actions with few conditions or prerequisites.  To me this makes the game easier to play/teach, and a bit more fun.  You're not totally going along for the ride, but many of the event vs points decisions are easier when compared to twilight struggle or labyrinth or the COIN series.  Additionally since some spaces on the board are worth 5x-10x other spaces, beginners have a good idea where to focus, and less of a blank slate to work with.

RATING: 8.6
Grows on me with each play (I've played quite a bit online at Game Tables Online). There's a lot of tactical depth even despite the great importance of issues and the comparative insignificance of advertising.

However, because of the importance of the issues, there is a delicate balance when playing cards with powerful events. Players have to determine when it is worth giving up a turn of back and forth on the issues to play a particularly powerful event.

Creative card play to limit the negative effect of events activated by ones opponent is also an intriguing aspect of the game. The game gives so many options for mitigating their effects. One can:

1) Preempt events.
2) Use the candidate card to avoid playing another card.
3) Bury the card in Campaign Strategy.
4) Bluff with less damaging cards to run the opponent out of momentum.
5) Play a card at the end of the turn when it does little damage.
6) Influence the board to limit the effects of an event.

RATING: 8
A very well thought-out game that has one of the best manuals ever written.  The theme is a plus for me, and the research put into the game is evident in every aspect of the board, cards and tokens.  A game can easily be played in under 2 hours and the reply value is high due to there being several different stategies to try out (and not enough time (or campaign points) to do them).  Just can't say enough good things about the game.

RATING: 5
1960 has a lot of good parts to it.  It has a great events system built on a shared deck which works very well.  It has several interesting subsystems, which model positioning on issues, the debates, and the whims of election day.  Unfortunately, 1960 also has an older brother named [gameid=12333].  And unfortunately, everything that I like about 1960 is kept and improved upon in Twilight Struggle.  In addition, TS improves upon 1960 in several key areas, namely tighter deck-management, lower luck factor, easier score tracking, and a much more interesting theme. The theme in 1960 is particularly troubling, especially how fast and loose states can change back and forth.  Either the political reality of 1960 is wildly different than it is today, or else it's really antithematic that some states would go red or blue in a close election.  I have a difficult time seeing New York going anything but blue, for instance.  It comes down to this: I would love 1960 if TS didn't exist, but I just can't justify bringing out this title when I can get a better experience elsewhere.

(9/08)  I had heard it was a good intro to the card driven series of games . . .  and it was.  I liked the give and take vying for control of states in the midst of an election.

I enjoyed it and would love to play it again soon.

** Based on one play, I'm giving this a 9. I love the theme - I really felt I was fighting a rough election campaign, with all the swings, hostile media coverage and unexpected events. As someone who was heavily involved in youth politics, it captured the excitement of a real election campaign.

It is rough, combative and you have to be paying attention and thinking on your feet. A bad event can wreck long-term strategy, but I felt I could mitigate my several bad card draws by focusing on momentum/advertising/issues to swing the game. Not sure if that will continue with repeat plays.

Based on one play, I preferred it to Twilight Struggle, which felt a bit 'scripted'. 1960 doesn't play out like the real election - it is more flexible than that. I can see that, if you got really into TS, it would probably be a more controllable game.

Having played a few rounds of Twilight Struggle, I was prepared to approach this game, and it probably helped a lot in learning it and moving straight in to it.  It definitely seems lighter, though it also moves a bit more quickly as a result.  The key mechanism of the game is in the cards, since they do a number of different things, and there's a nice metagame aspect to it at the beginning of each round, as you try to determine how to play your hand, and which cards to save for the debates and the election.  I didn't quite make it through my first game, but I look forward to the next one.

The second game saw some improvements, in that we think that we were playing the support draws from the bag incorrectly in our first game.  The different ways that the cards work in different circumstances, and the timing of playing the cards, is what gives the game its tension.  There are some key areas that deserve the most attention on the map, but it's important not to overlook the smaller states, also.

All told, it probably lacks some of the depth that players find in Twilight Struggle, but the fact that this game is usually over in about two hours, tops, whereas Twilight Struggle can last for up to five hours, makes it a nice game to have for when you have that itch, but don't want to devote that much time to a game.

In 1960: The Making of the President, you take on the role of one of these great protagonists vying to lead America through an era of turbulent change. The candidates must contend with all the great issues of the day, from the Cold War to civil rights to voters' pocket books. This is an election that will turn on positioning and momentum. The contest is fought on an electoral map of the United States as it stood in 1960. Using a card-driven game system, all the major events which shaped the campaign are represented: Nixon's lazy shave, President Eisenhower's late endorsement, and the 'Catholic question' are all specific event cards. The famous televised debates are also an important component of gameplay.

As with a real election campaign, the challenge is to adapt your game plan as the ground shifts out from under you. There are never enough resources or time to do everything, but you need to make the tough calls to propel yourself into the White House. This fast-playing strategy game for two players challenges you to relive the most significant political contest of the Twentieth Century. Will you recreate history, or rewrite it? 1960: The Making of the President provides you the opportunity to do both.

This is an excellent card-driven game of campaign politics, based on the Nixon/Kennedy presidential election. Not only is it fun, it's also a damn good history lesson. I went into my first game of 1960 expecting to be a little bored by the theme. How wrong I was. Almost every event card that entered my hand made me say "No way...that actually happened?" I'd never fully understood why this election was considered such a pivotal event, aside from Kennedy going on to become a beloved American icon. (To be fair, I missed this particular party by about a decade and a half...I'm a Reagan era kid!) Needless to say, I thoroughly enjoyed the history lesson.

As for the actual nuts and bolts of the game, it's a solid adaptation of the Twilight Struggle system. The only feature I don't care for are the debates. I'm still not sure if they are meant to be used as a card dump or if they're actually something to focus your campaign strategy around. It doesn't seem like a great idea to burn strong cards in setting up for the it, since the rewards aren't overwhelmingly good. Yet if you don't prepare and just discard to it at random, then the whole phase can really burn you. That's a fairly minor complaint though, as the rest of the game is an entertaining and educational tug-of-war that keeps both players engaged right up until election night.

Like the theme of this one; the information on the cards is really interesting (especially for someone like me who didn't live through this particular election).

The best example I know of a game that reads much better than it plays.  It feels disjointed and underdeveloped.  Too many events allow direct placement, bypassing Support Checks and reducing media importance and the benefit of carrying states (I'm very surprised the 2nd edition didn't go the other way on the clarification for that).

The Dunnagan variant (the icon on the CP card is off-limits when Positioning) seems good, but doesn't go quite far enough.  Great theme, just not quite what it could have been.  Too much tit-for-tat, not enough tension WRT opponent's events, too many underutilized (false) choices.

I'm quite disappointed of this one. 
Ok, US election is more the theme for US players than for Germans. 
But I found the games mechanics quite dull (issue support), ineffective (endorsements) and too luck dependent (Turn 6, media support, cards). Momentum is a nice new feature in CDGs, but had mostly passive effects in our games. Board graphics are too basic and  confusing IMO. Actual score is always unclear. Too few cubes in all of our games (always exhausted in turn 7). 
1960 is far away from the brilliance of Twilight Struggle. Worst CDG so far in my opinion. 
5 point rating only due to very good production quality (box, cards + mounted board). 

Until 2008-10-10: 5 plays

In all ways this is a brilliant game. Mechanics are simple, yet one to get your teeth into. The theme fits perfectly and is used even more perfectly.  History lessons as you play too. Production quality is excellent. So many options and ways to ensure you win.  Loads of cards and all unique. Nice size box. A nice big board worthy of a big game. Strategy, tactics, luck and randomness all rolled into one. All this and it is for 2 players.  This makes me so happy that I am a gamer cos I would hate to miss out on this one.

I do not know what I was expecting from this game.  I've only played it once, and it was not taught to me very well (my teacher needed a lot of help from other people to explain how to play the game, since he didn't know very well).  I need to give this another chance, but it just seems like there is too much text on the cards, which are such an integral part of the game.

Okay, played once myself and then once with an actual person. It's a great game. Lots of things that you want to do, but limited resources mean you have some tough decisions. Our game ended Kennedy 254, Nixon 283. Nixon got Texas right at the end, barely and that made the difference.

Like it, it's not better than its older brother TS, but still a good game. My GF hated it but that had to do with theme. I like the tension and the climax of counting the votes at the end. Really feels like an election at that stage.

I love CDGs and this one I like a lot.  I am a bit young for the theme (I was born in '72), but I learned the history in school and the cards gave me even more info about this period.  Have won as both sides and lost as Nixon once.  Love it!

RATING: N/A
Love the subject matter and period. Can't wait. [Update] Components are top notch, and for anyone who has complained about games made in China, well, this shows that good ones can be produced there. The card stock is especially good. My only complaint with the game is the rules aren't as clear as they could be, despite numerous diagrams and pictures. Hopefully playing through it solitaire a few times will clarify things.

While only having played it once so far I love the theme, and I especially like the way the game captures the events that occurred at that point in time.

One of my favourite games, although I've only played it a handful of times. The multi-use cards mean interesting and potentially agonising decisions are usually required to be made.

When I first saw the box I wrote this game off. While the politics theme interested me the Nixon/Kennedy election did not.

After one play I was hooked. I find this far more enjoyable then TS due to the visual appeal, length of play and far more accessable rules. (People can be competitive on their first or second game in 1960's, not so in TS)

The playtime of 60-90 minutes is right up my alley. If you have not tried this out, give it a shot....even if you hated TS. (I was not a fan)

Very immersive.  Love that you are forced to constantly deal with the direct conflict of your opponent as you also attempt to implement a strategy for your candidate.  An amazing design. The best of all election style games.

I played a game with my daughter a few months ago which still makes me smile.  She was Kennedy, and I attempted to re-write history with Nixon.  Throughout the game I battled hard in the Northeast.  At one point I even gained New York and Massachusetts.  As I spent my time and resources in her backyard, she flew to the west coast a few times and poked me in California.  I was always able to rebuff her.

We battled on issues, neither of us really doing much for our campaigns, and we also hit hard on advertising.  She gained, then maintained the upper hand on that front.  The debates were a wash.  

On the last turn of the game, she flew to California again.  I thought, "Good.  Waste your time Sweetie, because I've got cards that are gonna win New York for me and maybe even Pennsylvania."

The cards we had been storing up for election day were revealed, support checks were made, and she kept New York, Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania while throwing me a bone in Ohio.  My eyes turned west and my heart sank as she stole California on support checks because of smart card play.

Not only did Kennedy win, but if Nixon would have been beaten in real life as soundly as I was, he never would have drew breath politically again.

I had a blast.  I thought of that game every day for some time.  That's what excellent games do. They tickle your brain and lighten your mood.

The tension 1960 creates makes a two hour game seem much shorter.  Replay value is high.  :)

After two plays, it seems to take too long to play, and all the different cards that do the same thing but one cube more or less or only in the south or whatever - after a while, just give it a rest already, I'm sick of these cards. For the time investment, the strategy is low and the tactics is on the low side also. Really not my kind of game, but my wife is interested in trying it again, so maybe I'll like it better next time.

After a third play: Liked it much better. More familiarity with the cards makes long term strategies more apparent. Still long and lots of luck, but I'm raising my rating.

After a fourth play: Getting tired of it already. Downgrading again. But my wife really likes it, which is great.

RATING: 5
I have some concerns.  'Issues' seem an oddly abstracted concept (what exactly is playing Ops into Issues representing?) while simultaneously of commanding importance, almost always more than that of campaigning or media buying.  Media buying, a huge part of modern campaigns, is completely neglected and of tertiary importance.  There is no card management in the game, and no real chance for strategic movement.  In short, I feel as if the designers, in attempting to make a 'TS-lite', have instead made the game a bit facile instead.  Still, I do like the topic, though it's a bit too long to be truly classified as a 'filler' game.

De uno de los creadores del afamado "Twilight Struggle". Dos jugadores se enfrentan en las elecciones de 1960 entre Nixon y Kennedy. A lo largo del mapa de los EE.UU. debemos ir consiguiendo apoyos por los diferentes estados, ganando debates y jugando cartas de acontecimientos históricos reales. Un poco más sencillo que su hermano mayor Twilight, aunque sigue siendo complejo. Gran juego.

Great game about the election in 1960 between Kennedy and Nixon. A lot of flavour and theme. The game is pretty simple. You send your candidate to different states to gain votes or you can trigger different historical episodes that will help your candidate. There are also other aspects to manage like media. The only thing I wish was better is the debate, I don't think it is important enough and it should also be a better "build up" to the great debate. I think this could be fixed with a great houserule though.

After two plays of this game, I am in love with it.  I only wish I could read my wife a little better.  I know she doesn't particularly like the length of the game.  Part of it her fault - she has a little AP syndrome.  Her first move of the game took 10 minutes - I timed it!  I hope as she becomes more familiar it will streamline.  If we could play in 60-90 minutes I am sure it would hit the table more often.

Other than that, there is nothing I don't like about this game.  It is so realistic.  I haven't played another game where the mechanics and the theme meld so well together.  It is so much like real life it is scary.  There are about a million things you want to do but are limited by your time and money and have to do what is best at the time.  However, there are events taking place all around you that are out of your control.  As Kennedy, you want to campaign in the West but Congress calls an emergency session and you must do your job - fly back to Maryland and suffer a penalty to movement.  Or as Nixon you bang your knee on your car door and are in the hospital unable to campaign at all.

There have been some people who don't particularly like the debate section.  I think it is an interesting part of the game.  Winning the last issue allows you to put four state support anywhere on the board.  Two turns from election day, this could put a serious hamper on your opponent's final campaign strategy.  Trying to figure out how to play your cards without getting burned by opponent's events and placing the right cards into the debates (right issue, right candidate, right CP value) makes for an interesting challenge.  I know my wife has been frustrated by her lack of ability to play the debates well and me being able to put a lot of state support onto the board.

I largely admired the game system, and historical setting, but did not have a great deal of fun playing the game. I learnt stuff, sure, but would rather snatch many other games off of the game-shelf before I picked this one.

I like drama, strategy, and tense gameplay - 1960 has bullet-proof limousines stuffed with all that, but I don't like to feel stressed the whole way through a 2-hour game. The Making of the President was just too intense for me - too much of a direct confrontation with my gaming buddy.

Completely lacked the tension felt in Twilight Struggle.  Maybe it was due to how the cards were dealt out, but at no point was I pressured by what I should play.  As a result, the momentum markers seemed fairly useless which then made the issue track not as important.  Although the media was fully utilized by my opponenet, it only ended up helping him win two undecided states but he still lost the game anyway.  Advertising was not even bothered with at all and I don't think we performed any support checks outside of the election itself.

Although 1960 is painstakingly accurate in the historical events it depicted, the game just was not that exciting to play, nor did I feel that I learned anything because of it.  I imagine the theme will probably be more appealing to those that have lived through the era.

I can't believe I waited so long before looking into this game. The card driven mechanics are similiar to many warlike games (Twilight Struggle et al), but 1960 introduces a fascinating theme of politics instead of war. The components of the 2nd edition are high quality and of sufficient size and sturdiness even for butterfingers. The ruleset is easy to learn and teach. Most importantly, there are plenty of tough decisions to make when you try to minimize the damage from your opponent while advancing your own strategy. For veterans of TS etc, 1960 can feel a little too simplistic and random after a few plays.

Everyone may not like the art in GMT's edition in comparison with the classic Z-Man Games edition. There are small rule tuneups but the game is still very much the same - and it's a good game. A great game for introducing new players to the card driven engine featured in many other GMT titles.

This game devolves in the same way that real-life US elections do - inevitably both players are fighting over 6 or so huge states and completely ignoring the lower-population territories.

The debate mechanic sets this apart from other CDGs, but that alone doesn't do enough for me to prefer playing this game to others in the genre.

10/30/07 - Well, after 1 play, I have a few comments.  First of all, I felt like the theme was sort of hollow.  The initial draw for me to the game was the unusual subject matter, so this was sort of a let down.  I say the theme is hollow because it expected me to remember the election a bit better then I do (which is not at all).  Perhaps it's just that US presidential elections are not as grand a topic as some of this game's competition.  I'm not sure yet.

The game also seemed to lack some of the tension I would have thought it should have.  Though this can easily be chalked up to inexperience in terms of me not understanding all of the ramifications of my actions, I felt that it was more because I had no idea who was winning/losing because I was not spending any time continually counting and recounting electoral votes to see who was in the lead.  So instead of the give and take of tough decision making, I just always chose whatever I thought increased my relative position by the largest margin.  Maybe more experience with the game would fix this, but at this time it's too soon to tell.  Just about any game deserves a second try, and I intend on giving one to 1960, but at this time I'm in no hurry to do so.

I played this once as Nixon. I didn't quite have a grasp of the debate mechanics, so I went in at a disadvantage, but won 2 of 3, so it wasn't so bad. I didn't have any Warfare (or whatever it's called) cards in my hand for the debate, but I was strong in the other two issues. The rest of the game was area control and hand management, both of which seemed mechanically pretty intuitive. 

The second game it went much more smoothly.  The game is quite elegant.  Rating raised.

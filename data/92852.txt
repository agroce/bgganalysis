Fun family game. Bit of a "bias" problem and it's no good with "new" friends.

Decent family-version of the original.  My 7-year-old can play it and enjoys it.  Lots of laughs.

RATING: 8.5
This is our go-to family party game. If you're playing withe people you know at least fairly well, it's even more fun than Wits & Wagers (and way better than Apples to Apples)!

OK game.  Although in a family you can almost guarantee a win by answering "Jesus", "Horse", or "Poo' depending on the question. [5-6]4-6

I think I understand why Northstar made this game, because the original had questions that could (with the right crowd) lead to answers that were quite inappropriate.  So here they just toned down the questions, focusing on topics that are a little more family-friendly, and put some cute meeple artwork on the cards.  Overall the game is the same as the original, and that's a really good thing.  However it falls short because of one simple problem...fewer players.  If anything I want to play Say Anything with [i]more[/i] people, not less.  If this version played with the same number of players I would rate it as highly as the original, but as it stands I have to knock it down a few pegs.

Not a bad version of Say Anything - wish there were more questions.

RATING: 4
I feel like this should be more fun, but it really suffers from indecisiveness .... I hesitate to call it AP because a game like this really shouldn't need any deep analysis, but people seem to really agonize over not only what to write down, but which one to choose for themselves as well as which *two* to bet on so there is way, way too much downtime with nothing to do but complain about the people/person taking forever.

Great game. This version allows the family to get involved. Questions are all over the place and there are not nearly enough questions for variety.

LOVE the gameplay on this, i was a little disappointed in the specific components in this one though based on the cool meeples in the family edition of  wits and wagers. it's functionally no different with chits so whatever. The game is greath with kids and families, and adults alike.

This is one of the best party games I've ever played.  And it really is great for families with or without kids.  Definitely worth keeping in a collection.

RATING: 6.5
Good family game that the kids enjoy. Not quite my cup of tea, but that is more because of the genre than the game itself. Nice scoring element with ability to gain points from separate entries or double points.

Fantastic! Have had two terrific sessions with players aged 71, 70, 44, 39, 8, and 5. Incredibly fun & interesting for the entire group, and all players were equally involved and capable of meaningful participation.

Update: go-to gift; go-to game to bring to a small gathering that includes kids

A great game to pull out when with family and friends. I would love to pair it's cards with the regular Say Anything because we've played enough times that most of us know the answers to the questions.

Family friendly edition of the classic party game, where players write answers to a question asked by the `judge', and then try to guess which answer he'd pick.

Essentially the same as the original Say Anything with a slight different focus on the questions.  So, still a lite party game for non-gamers provided you know something about the people with who you are playing As a game, I'm not really keen, but as a lite diversion for non-gamers, it's ok for a few laughs, but that's it. (20/11/11). Nice lite enjoyable party game for non-gamers provided you know something about the people with who you are playing (23/10/11).  UPDATE: Worthwhile with younger family members, but not really one for gamers, but a bit better than original as for this purpose, the questions are better (rating: 5.678, Feb 2015).

KIDS GAME.

Great components (theme meeples) and seems like it would be well-suited to younger kids.  For adults, and more players, I'd stick to the regular version.  Plus the regular edition has 5 questions/card, instead of the 3 you get in this game.

Good icebreaker or game for families who know each other well. The issue I have with this is there are some gamey moments, like where you won't play optimally so as not to give points to a leader. Definitely a hilarious game-tivity though.

Got the family version because of a Dice Tower review where Tom said it's still great if you're only playing with adults.  I totally agree.  With the kids you can keep things tame and they understand all of the clues.  In the regular edition, that we played once with my 8 year old daughter, some of the clues were not clear to her.  We've played with only adults and you can get as racy as you want.  I really don't understand the need to have all these adult games and versions of games out there.  If it's the right group for it, this and many other party games can go wherever you take them!

RATING: N/A
As I like the conversations that the original stimulates (though sometimes it can go into risqué territory), interested in maybe getting this just for more questions to add to original (and probably the pens too), as it seems the restriction of upto 6 players diminishes the fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.6
I like it better than the "adult" version, though a dial with more options (ie, more players) would be a good thing.  Even though it's family oriented, it was often hard to find a question that would work with our six and eight year-olds, mostly because they don't know songs that would make an older person feel young and they don't watch any TV or movies (it just works that way--they're not restricted from doing so).  Still, a good effort.

We enjoy Say Anything but in many cases the questions can lead humorous answers to slide towards less tasteful responses especially among adults. The Family version eliminates that.

Received in a Chain of Generosity (before giving away Time n Space. This is going to see a lot more play than that would have.

Haven't tried the non-family edition, but the family edition seems fine to me!

This is such a great all ages game. We've played with an age group ranging from ages 6 - 70 and everyone had fun and interacted with the game and each other well. I sometimes get confused on the scoring, so no two games have probably been scored the same in my house. We have a few dry erase markers that need to be replaced, but otherwise the game is holding up.

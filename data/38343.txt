Action selection mechanism was pretty cool.  Randomness of resource allocation among the planets was a little annoying.  I think I would have liked nicer (and bigger) cards as much as they get used.

A pleasant mix of Settlers, Robo Rally, and Race for the Galaxy set in space -- which is my favorite genre, and one that is not being served to capacity in my opinion.

Ad Astra (or "Ed Asner," as it's being called around here) is a collaboration between Bruno Faidutti and Serge Laget, two game designers for whom I have a great deal of appreciation.

Fantástico juego de estrategia espacial, de gestión de acciones. Con 6 tipos de recursos, contrucción de naves para explorar planetas boca abajo en difrentes sistemas, consigues un solo recurso por planeta o descubrir un planeta alienígena que te da una carta de tecnología alienígena especial, contrucción de colonias, fábricas para extraer recursos, y terraformaciones para darte puntos directos. Los jugadores alternan boca abajo las cartas de acciones en un tablero de planificación y puntuas extra si consigues destacar en alguna categoría en el momento exacto. No entiendo cómo no se habla más de él! Escala perfecto para cualquier numero de jugadores (3-5) y tiene suficiente rejugabilidad. Todo un gran descubrimiento!

Only played once, I enjoyed the idea but no-one else seemed to jump on board and I didn't have enough urge to bring it out on game night, I really enjoy the action selection mechanic but in reading the forums I felt like there were just a couple of clear strategies to pursue but it deserves a few more plays for the mechanics alone.

First game and an early valuation. Resource acquisition seems to drive the speed of the game so is slow at the beginning and faster later on. It will be interesting to see how much learning takes place to allow other strategies in later games and how much faster the game coudl be. My first game featured a low number of scoring cards played, so there was no gradual accumulation of points. Rather we had large numbers of points during the last quarter of the game.

The more I play Ad Astra, the more I like it. It's a really good game and I sincerely think it's underrated. Starting my boardgame collection, I bought this instead of Settlers, because in this game the luck-factor is way inferior. Also the components are tremendously good and the mechanic of putting the planets face down around stars gives you the feeling of space exploration more than the space versions of Settlers. 

I have to admit thought, that I wasn't so sure about my purchase, when I bought it, because of the comments about the game's imbalance (especially about Terraforming). After few plays I think that there's no problem with the balance here at all. I've also read in many comments that the game is too chaotic. That's also not true in my opinion, because just in few plays I was familiar enough with the mechanics to expect a good number of my opponents' moves. I think that a lot of people played Ad Astra one or maybe two times and judged it too fast. It really needs a bunch of plays to be really understood and appreciated.

The true Ad Astra is instead an agressive race and a great game. I played it many times and it never goes over one very intense hour, where every single move counts. It's a optimization exercise, with some interesting guessing aspects, and it's a really good game for these reasons. Great fun!

RATING: 8
FAVOURITE GAME - This is a good space exploration and civilization building game. It is not as heavy as you might think. First of all the players secretly plan the action phase after which you move, colonize, harvest, trade, whatever action was planned. It is very important to anticipate the opponents planned action, as they are available for you too with minor limitations, else you might be doubleing a selected action and have to forfeit. One of the nice things is that the players themselves trigger the scoring, so everyone will try to score whenever they feel they are in front. Don't let them. A nice thing that it has no player board: the planets are arranged on any flat surface which in turn counts as space.

A very good civ-building game in space. Although it does feel a tad like the Catan series, it doesn't have the heart of Catan, which is trading. Trading is there, but it is fairly minimal compared with Catan. It certainly is a game of simultaneous action selection, but unlike most others that I've played with this mechanic, it is exceedingly rare for a player to lament, "Why did you play THAT card now?"
The theme is there, but light. Theme it stronger (and with a theme that actually interests me!) and this game would get a rating well above 8 for me. It could easily be rethemed as (for example) a Pacific exploration game.

RATING: 6
I found the decision space interesting, but I think that Ad Astra takes a little bit too long to get going. I really like the Settlers of Catan in space vibe with less luck and new action programming. But the first half of the game is so slow and empty. It takes much too long to take off.

As I've said before, I'm a sucker for a good exploration theme, whether it's [gameid=1315], [gameid=223], or this one. Building ships, flying to other star systems, settling on planets to mine their resources to do it all again... great stuff. A board-game 3X game (eXplore, eXploit, eXpand). The role selection mechanic and the double-think behind it make the game much more interesting.

Purchased on the recommendation of someone at the Uni Game Group I'm a part of as it was cheap online. Played 7 times in the week after I acquired it and had read the rules, with her teaching the first game.
Seems to have easily identified similarities to Settlers of Catan in the resource production aspect and Race for the Galaxy in the action selection. I feel like I've played another game where you choose when scoring will take place but I don't recall which game it would have been.

I am not usually a fan of space games.  The images initially felt dark and too similar.  However the graphics were clear in play.  I even liked the plastic pieces and I am usually a wood fan.  OK its derivative - Settlers, Wallenstein...  but there were enough news twists to make this much more enjoyable than I had anticipated.  I would certainly be happy to play again.  The dynamic as to when to start playing the scoring cards was good.  The bizarre win if you have exactly (42? from memory) points a typical Bruno eccentricity.

This is one of these games where all the mechanics are ok, but overall I felt the game doesn't have something special to offer. I can't pinpoint why I was not enthusiastic with it. Perhaps it's the fact that you are too dependent on the hidden actions of the other players, which is too random. Or that I expected it to be a bit more heavy.
PS great graphic design.

I am not in love with Bruno Faidutti games (Citadels is good, but not one of my favorites, and his other games are not my cup of tea), but Ad Astra earns a spot in my collection.

8/29/10 - Two plays.  Decent game.  I like the idea of it, however in both games played, the first person to build a Terraformer won the game.  I've read that there are other strategies that are even more viable, but thus far that's how it has played out. I was disappointed by not being able to slow my opponents and having to blindly search out resources by uncovering planets.  In both games I was short on water and couldn't find a system that had it.  Neither game went went.  I do believe that further playings with different people may push this to a "7".

Here are the reasons why I do not like this game:

Well themed space exploration game with nice bits and pieces. Mechanics work together very well and I really like the action track. Anticipating other people's actions and leeching of them is a very big part of the game. The fact you can only play a scoring card again when all others have been played prevents people going all out for one strategy. So you have to build a balanced engine to get your vp's flowing at a decent rate. The game Sternenfahrer of Catan was aspiring to be.

Gathering resources and trading them in to build things that can gather more resources, etc. is not really a game mechanism that gets me excited.  But apparently if you put it in space, I'm gonna be hooked.  This game knocked my socks off.  I had such a great time with the space exploration and strategic card play.  It was really interesting seeing the multiple paths to victory, and the way we slowly figured out how to play our action cards more strategically.

It certainly didn't hurt my opinion of the game that I won by a lot.  But what made it a really memorable game experience was the fact that, even though I won by about 20 points, one of the players almost stole my win with a special card that allows a player with exactly 42 points to win.  The strongest indicator that this was an awesome game is that, as soon as we were done playing, we all started talking about what we would do differently next time.  I think that shows just how much we were all intrigued by the experience.  I will happily play this game again any time.

Faidutti is known for taking popular games and sort of spinning them into his creations.  He did it with El Grande (Mission: Red Planet), Clue (Mystery of the Abbey) and now Settlers of Catan.  He's enlisted Serge Laget and the game is very tight...but enjoyable.  There are lots of ways to win and the game actually lacks that signature Faidutti Chaos.  Still if you know some snob who is 'done with Catan' then this is a good game to play instead.  Too bad it's OOP.

Yeah, its space Settlers, slightly twisted, with a determinative production. Some neat things going on. Seemed a little hard to get started if you didnt have energy, though. Ill keep an eye on that.

-Edit: Played some incorrect rules at startup. I bet this will increase, cause the slow start will be alleviated. 

-Edit: Played correctly, and went well. I really like this, played without the 2 wacky artifacts and with a starting setup that doesn't have 2 people on the same type of planet. Now, how to correct that silly move-card imbalance. Sigh.

This game is just not hitting the table.  It does not generate much interest when I suggest it, and I don't suggest it very often.  I'll make and effort to get it to the table and determine if it's going to stay in my collection or get traded away.

I'm just not getting this to the table, and I'm really not feeling like I want to make the effort, as I own so many better games, this is headed to the trade pile.

Kind of like Settlers, with a science fiction theme (yay) and lower randomness. Unfortunately, scoring isn't done organically: you must take actions to score. At one level, this works, because people who spend actions scoring aren't spending them building, which trades off current profits for future growth. In the end, however, scoring ends up being more important. This leaves me unsatisfied with a game that feels like it should be about building things.

This game's ok. MY proble mwith it is that resources are too easy to acquire, making one-on-one trades with the other players (which might benefit them more than you) superfluous as players often have handfull of cards they are quite willing to trade into the bank. My suggestion to fix this is to not allow ships to generate resources.

Not a bad game though. I would play it again.

Ad Astra is a solid space exploration game that feels kind of like settlers in space but much more strategic as you can actually have a plan and execute it well (settlers has a really high luck factor).

Very easy to teach this one, as the rules are fairly straightforward and intuitive.  The gameplay isn't obvious though, which gives the game some depth.

Only complaint is that there really is little player interaction.  You can't really target players effectively, take over planets, etc, which would add a whole new level to the game.  A little too friendly and solo for my tastes.

A beautiful game, and fun to play despite its unpredictability. It's more interesting in some ways than Settlers, though I probably like the open trading of Settlers more than the restrictive trading rules here. The game also reminds me of RoboRally with its action track: players lay down actions without knowledge of what their opponents are placing down, and it becomes very hard to predict what will happen over the course of the round. This can be funny at times and frustrating at others. The game is beautiful, and I like the theme more than Settlers, but I don't think this will replace it for me.

Basically a Settlers of Catan variant!  The twist here is that players plan out a turn via a set of action cards that dictate when planets produce, when players can build stuff, when ships can move, and when points are scored.  So, it takes all of the elements of Settlers of Catan (or even more accurately, Starfarers of Catan) and drops a new engine into it.  Good for what it is, and I can see perhaps pulling this out instead of Settlers from time to time.

Similar to Starfarers of Catan but with an interesting variable 'board'. The two choices offered by each card works well.

When I say that Ad Astra is essentially "Catan in Space", it's not just that it's been re-themed.  I'm referring to the fact that this is Catan with all the extraneous bits and frustrating cubbies scorched and scored away leaving behind a smoother experience.  This has all the exploration and resource management that I genuinely enjoy about Catan without the reliance on randomization and dead ends that have utterly decimated my enjoyment of the game.

I don't know that this is a game that will last a very long time but I am definitely still in the mood to play.

RATING: 7.5
Ad Astra is a sci-fi resource production/trade VP game.  Unlike most other games in that category (e.g. Eclipse) Ad Astra does not have any combat mechanics.  Player interaction is nearly non-existent.

Players place action cards on a track face-down.  These cards are turned face-up one at a time, and all players take the action associated with that card.  (The card's owner has a special privilege, similar to the role cards in Puerto Rico.)  Much of the game's strategy comes from predicting what cards your opponents will play. 

Each of the 5 players is approximately symmetrical; each colour's action cards are slightly different; movement cards allow each player to reach 6 of 8 star systems with their own cards -- the remaining 2 star systems are only accessible via opponents' action cards.  Likewise, resource production cards can each produce 2 or the 6 resources, but the pairings are different for each player (e.g. one player has food and water on the same card, another has food + energy and water + ore on two cards).

The game's rules are fairly simple; familiarity with other resource production games (e.g. Settlers, Puerto Rico) helps, but is not strictly necessary.  I got my parents to try the game once and after a round or two they were comfortable with it.

The game works reasonably well with two players; simply use the first 8 action card spaces (i.e. each player plays 4 actions per turn, just like in a three player game).

My friend bought it at Gencon.  Eager to try it out.

Found that the metals seem more valuable then food, water and energy but that may change with more plays.

I picked Ad Astra up during a moving sale. After playing it a handful of times, it was... okay. It's sort of like a bizarre space-themed mix of Catan and Puerto Rico, but it didn't really excel at either of those. The whole thing felt mediocre and like I'd rather be playing those other two games. It also has a borderline broken player aid that straight out omits important rules, and obfuscates many of the others with cryptic symbols. The artwork and graphic design was pretty good, though, so, there's that.

I had all but written Bruno Faidutti off, but this is actually a fun game. Certainly his best big box games, and his best overall game since 2004's Boomtown. The signature Bruno chaos is here, but it's significantly toned down. That is, you don't plan for something, and something completely messes things up (a la Mission Red Planet which really rubbed me the wrong way). It has 6 different resources, but really of only 3 unique types. That is, 2 of the resources are used in exactly the same places in the same quantities, and 3 others likewise. I would have liked to have seen slightly more distinction between the resources. The thing that I can't love about the game (but also is required to make it work) is the idea of putting down "commands" or "options" in a group sequence which apply to everyone face down, so you don't really know what's coming up. So planning requires guessing what other players might be placing. But since you place some yourself, at least you know some of them. And there's crazy nuking or moving them around. It is admittedly interesting that you can choose where on the order to place your cards. In my one game it was common to try to get at least one card played early in the sequence, but playing late can also be useful.

Strikes me as the sort of game that wants experienced players and/or a consistent playgroup to shine - there seem to be blind alleys (of resource-combination and what you're producing relative to everyone else) which can effectively knock you out of the game via inefficiency, and the psych game of "what has Player X put on the action track?" seems like it'd be far more interestingly foreseeable with deeper understanding of the game and of the other players (and ideally, with those other players [i]also[/i] having deeper understanding of the game).

The "win if you have exactly 42" card bugs me less than I'd expect because (a) 42 is close to a game-ending score, and (b) all players can force scoring to happen, so someone can't just hang out on 42 and autowin. It can create a real feel-bad moment if it takes someone by surprise, though. And "+10 points" (am I remembering that card right?) just seems really excessive.

One step higher than Settlers one step below Puerto Rico, overall a very entertaining game with a couple of bright ideas. The exploration aspect of the game is always exciting and gives it an excellent replayability; and the role choosing and placing (on the order of play track) lets you try interesting strategies.
I rate it an 8 because it is very family/non-gamer-friendly yet it offers some rewarding experience.

Make sure you're on a planet that other people are going to want to produce. Specifically Energy early on. Which you can't fly without. To get to somewhere else to get in on the Energy production.

Settlers of Catan meets Race for the Galaxy meets Wallenstein. It's not a bad game. The mechanics are sound and the playing time quick.

But it's a by now familiar trend among the euro gaming industry, i.e. mix & match the mechanics, paste a new theme on it, and call it a day. If you get the feeling you've played games like this before, it's because you have.

RATING: 5
There are many interesting ideas in this game, but it fell flat for me primarily because of the programmed action track.  Upon reading this game, the idea that all players program their actions on a shared track seemed exciting.  But in practice, every time you place a card you are either placing it on the first available space or the last available space depending on whether you want to do it before everyone else or after everyone else.  We never really found a reason to put your actions anywhere in between.  This mechanism made choosing your actions take longer with no payoff.

Similarly, the movement system was unnecessarily confusing and the game would probably be better served with a more traditional board design.

I applaud the creative thinking that went into this design, but I think it works out to be less than the sum of its parts.  The underlying game of building on planets and gaining resources is not especially exciting taken on its own merits.  Once you realize the interesting stuff doesn't do much, you are left with a mediocre game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Space expansion and colonisation game.  Players alternate playing action cards face down into a 15 space board, then the actions are resolved from 1 to 15.  In Puerto Rico fashion, all players get to do every action, with the card owner getting to do a little more.  It's all about grabbing Catan type stuff to build colonies (settlements) or factories (cities) to increase more production to get more stuff.  Or you can build spacecraft (roads) to expand to new worlds.  A typical Fadutti effort, with tons of mechanics lifted from other games and melded here.  And it does work, sort of.  Our first game was heading for 3 hours before we "got it" and began slapping down victory point cards with abandon - then the game zoomed off and finished in about 30 minutes.  The pacing of the game play felt good, but you have to think big picture or it will literally take all night.  Tentative rating of 6 - could go up or down.  Oh, worst start player token ever! 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A provisional 7.  Overall I think it works, but there were a bunch of minor things that bothered me.  Like, the whole placement of actions onto the board seemed like false choices-- each player could just have three actions in front of him, and they take turns around the table playing one each (in order).  Also, not sure how I feel about a Catan-ish game where production is determined by the players rather than dice!  I like it in theory, but it strangely felt unfair somehow.  Need to try it again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
I've played once so far and it was very interesting.  It seems like the type of game that you need to play a few times to try out different strategies and figure out what works the best.  I like that it is a resource collection and expansion game like Settlers, but more strategic, and a better theme.  I also like that it adds a more interesting travel and exploration element than Settlers.  Looking forward to future plays.

Update: After a few more plays, I still enjoy this, but there are a few fiddly rules that can cause problems if you overlook them.  Also, the unpredictability of other players' choices can make it frustrating at times.  I want to try again though.

The game looks cool, like a mini galaxy with stars, planets, buildings, and ships.  The exploration feel is well-captured.   I'm not crazy about the player-elected scoring and the king-making that can result, but it doesn't ruin the game at all.   Good stuff, and an unexpected hit for me.

An improvement of Starfarers of Catan?! Is that what people are calling this? Good grief. Not as much interaction as Catan, and the only times when there is interaction, through the card placement, is a 15-card blind-bidding orgy. 

And the theme is not as compelling as that of Starfarers, which for a Nexus/FFG game, is a huge indictment.

RATING: 6
[1 play] If you've played both Settlers of Catan and any of the role-selection games (Puerto Rico, San Juan, Race for the Galaxy), this game is really surprisingly easy to learn.  (It's ironic that although I still can't make sense of RftG, trying to do so has helped me learn other games.)  

The mechanism of the card tableau is nifty.  Each person gets to contribute 3 cards which will cause stuff to happen as they are played, and you can put them into the sequence (first come first serve) in any order you wish.  

The group I played with purged from the game the card that gives you automatic victory if your final score is 42, but I would play with this--I think it's hilarious and awesome.  Especially given how little control you have over your own score, it would be very hard to do.  But it would be like a Bene Gesserit prediction victory in Dune.

The only thing I did not like about this game was that ours ended very suddenly.  One player just swept to victory by building terraformers, and it ended before we had even explored all the worlds.  I don't like games where the game makes you feel that it's about building or doing something, and then the game tends to end prematurely before you have much of a chance to do whatever that thing is.  But I would certainly play Ad Astra some more to see how it goes.

This game really dragged. I think it was the chaotic reveal of the action cards that made progress difficult.

Not that exciting as I hoped for (Faidutti & Laget). Lots of actions turn out to be useless because of the blind planning fase. (for example 3 building or travel actions in a row) Once a players' engine is started it is very difficult to stop it. So the leader is running further and further away. Being the leader depends on luck while exploring planets.

RATING: 6
A fun and relatively simple space civ-building game with some cool concepts.  After a few plays, there don't seem to be a lot of strategies to be successful in Ad Astra, potentially limiting replayability, and seems to favor short-term opportunistic moves, over longer-term strategies.  However, it's an enjoyable game for what it is, and is one of the easiest games to learn of its kind.

Christmas 2009, from Bree.

Combines nicely, known mechanics from Puerto Rico and Catan so it is not hard to pick up, and I enjoy the mix.  Game plays reasonably fast.

I was disappointed in the cheap plastic pieces; the rest of the game is nice.  

An important factor in this game is anticipating what 4 secret actions your opponents will choose.  Building terraformers appears to be the most obvious path to victory--not sure how strong the other paths to victory are--requires more play but the terraforming might make the game a little lopsided.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Initial reactions from opening the box, punching out the pieces, and reviewing the rules and components:  This game looks great.  I love how it looks like a modern version of Starfarers of Catan.  

I think it's possible for my rating to go up with more plays of this game.

You can play this with only 2 persons and it is fun (it is better with more players).  The variant we used was to have 8 action cards, 4 per player, in a round and we used the red and yellow players to ensure that all systems were available.  We also used the trade variant where a small stack was available for 1-1 trading.

A bit boring, but peaceful Settlers style resource game set in space without the high luck factor of other Catan games.

I do like the way the planets are spread out as the space ships voyage place to place- setting up city & other structure miniatures onto these planets is visually enticing.

Un juego que para mi es muy truculento con finales inesperados, muy demandante en cuanto a la estrategia de como uses las cartas en cada una de las fases escogidas si es de producción o de territorios o de maves...mas de lo que le da el Geek ...para mi es un 8,5...no es 9 debido a falta de interaccion entre jugadores o fase de combate....

It took me completely by surprise - some reviews described Ad Astra as 'Catan in space' and the only thing these games have in common are hex-shaped tiles.

The mechanics of role selection is great - sometimes it leads to analysis-paralysis but it's bearable. There are no obvious decisions in the game and the scoring mechanism is actually pretty clever.

Some randomness (discovering of the planets) just adds a bit flavour.

The game is tense, full of decisions and pretty. Play it.

Not a bad Catan-like experience. I dislike the score cards; they seem too easy to exploit so far. I'd like to play more and find that I'm wrong.

The theme sends mixed signals. It seems like a serious game, but references Hitchhiker's Guide.

Some of the alien cards are too random, and the variable player powers are interesting, but sometimes combine poorly with the random start worlds.

All in all, this is a good space civ game though.

When I first started playing this game, I thought it was so-so and almost pointless.  But then the halfway point in the game came, and I realized just how much thinking ahead you have to do.  The last half of the game is when things start happening really fast, and if you don't prepare for it in the first half, you're going to get left in the space dust.  Fairly good game.

Another take on the Catan formula. Really like it and that it does not rely on dice luck. the Action-Selection-system is really well implemented and the mixing of planets helps with the theme of being explorers. Recommend it.

Ad Astra will instantly remind most gamers of Settlers of Catan, except that there are no dice here and no consistent turn structure.  Instead, players choose the timing and frequency of each game element by playing hidden action cards into a shared queue.  An action card might cause resource production on all water planets (or any one of the other five productive planet types), initiate a trading phase, let everyone build something, let everyone move their ships, or trigger one of several types of scoring rounds.  Each card impacts all the players.  So the trick is to choose the actions that will give you the biggest advantages at the best times, and also to position yourself to ride the coattails of the other players.

It's a nifty system, but something feels a little . . . rehearsed.  There is a distinct sense of entrenchment and predictability to the whole affair. Very quickly, players get trapped into a pattern of churning the same favorable actions repeatedly.  Any early imbalances will gain momentum over time, until someone creeps past the finish line.  The combination of deterministic player-triggered resource production and deterministic player-triggered scoring results in a mechanical game without much excitement or surprise.

A simple explore-space type game with some great mechanics that speed gameplay along. I think it would be a pretty tight race when experienced players went up against each other.

I really like the theme in this one and don't mind the non-confrontational mechanics in the game. It’s just that I had higher expectations for this game, as it sounds like a light fun game. There just seems to be more tactics than strategy in the game and the tactics are screwed by the player driven chaos. I’m fine with that, but it just seems to drag on too much for this type of game. It’s an intriguing game, which I want to try again, but there were certainly not love at first sight.

RATING: 5.1
There is nothing wrong with this game, it's just "more of the same". It lacks of originality. Basicly you play Settlers in space and that's all. In a five player game starting players will have distinct advantages over the last ones. Furthermore it seems that the terraforming-strategy is superior (as long as not all player go for this). So I was rahter underwhelmed and it left me lukewarm.
Edit: just found out we played our first game not correctly as we allowed to build [i]more[/i] than one terraformer on a planet (as it was not explicit forbidden). This would result in that the Terraforming strategy was not as easy/cheap to realise in the game, which would lead to a more balanced game. Must try again someday.

Simple game, yet very entertaining. 

I still have to see if there are very significant decisions to be made, or there is one, and only one path to victory. As for now a couple of strategies seem viable. 

It is a tad long for what it is. 

Future plays will decide if this will go up or down.

One of the best Bruno Faidutti games in years - probably because of the influence of Serge Laget? In any case do I like the mix of chaos, luck and strategy - with a few changes that removes some of the luck (read Bruno's replies in the forum).
The more I play it 3 times so far - the more I become aware of how to maximise my actions and utilise the actions given to me by my opponents.
The game is ruthless - but fun!

RATING: 6
A good game of space exploration and colonization. The parallels with Settlers of Catan are obvious, but it also has some card resource choices very similar to Wallenstein. 

Overall, I found it to be a good game. However, as I told my game group, I think if I had played this 5 to 7 years ago, I would have thought it was great. Since then, there have been so many new and interesting designs that I'm a little reluctant to pull out a Settlers variant. This one just doesn't have enough interesting things going on to strongly recommend it. Additionally, I think I'd actually prefer Starfarers of Catan to Ad Astra.

Enjoyed my first couple of games of this. Similarities to Settlers of Catan but with each player making decisions on which resources are produced, when to build, trade, etc. I like the scoring cards too and the fact that you only get them back when you've played all three. It makes the decision of when to score very interesting.

Very good game, albeit a bit derivative, admittedly influenced by "Settlers of Catan". But it is an improvement that resource production is decided by the players instead of dice. And although others have pointed out reminiscences of "Race for the Galaxy" in the planning phase, I thought it came directly from "Atlas & Zeus". Score is totally in the hands of the players, causing a strong possibility of kingmaking, but it also grants a lot of freedom in the choice of strategies. The sheer number of face-down action cards per round can make the game a little chaotic, and trying to guess what others will play seems pointless for the most part. On the production side, the miniatures are very small and not particularly inspired, but they are certainly better than dull wooden pieces.

I hope over time it will play quicker.  But, I do like the action line and the various things that can be accomplished to win the game.  But, it seems like too MANY actions come up each turn.

Ad Astra is a nice game and for me it's much better than Settlers (as they share much). However it got many flaws too, atleast if you think about it all. The different races (colors) have different cards and here we have the biggest flaw. Some races are strictly better than others, wtf?!

The different strategys don't seem to be balanced well, too. The good, but also bad thing (depending on your taste) is the card-track, as this adds a good amount of chaos to the game. You just don't know what and when something will happen, except for the cards you layed down, of course. This can give a player a big boost, while others don't get anything out of it.

I'm not wild on Ad Astra. If getting to the resources that you wanted to get to were a little less random, I think I'd like it a lot more. Unfortunately the trading mechanic doesn't seem to smooth out resource availability all that much. That said, we don't play this game a lot, so it's quite possible that there are avenues that I haven't explored yet. Interesting mechanics, not a bad game, but not one of my favorites.

Faidutti & Laget do Catan in space.  The action programming is fun, but often feels random. The special cards are thankfully not of the usual Faidutti, "exchange-your-seat-with-you-neighbourg" type.  There are lots of ways the game can evolve differently.  Lots of potential.

I really enjoyed this game. If you are clever, you can pull off some really great moves in the planning phase that pan out in the action phase. The alien cards should have explanations, but luckily the reference fixes that. I enjoyed this and really want to get in more plays.

Reasons why I enjoy it more than Settlers:

1) The role picking mechanism is a significant improvement; less downtime, and some strategy/bluffing instead of just plain die-rolling.

2) Trade is somewhat restricted, so the game doesn't drag on too long during that phase.


Reasons why I still don't love the game:

1) The role picking mechanism is a bit too chaotic for me

2) Some memorizing required (types of worlds seen)

RATING: 8
A smooth blending of a number of game mechanisms, with a light science-fiction/space theme. First play took 3h 15m for a 3P game, with 15-20m rules explanation for all newbies.

*Settlers-like resource production, resource trading, planet controlling, and unit building.
*Race for the Galaxy-like piggy-backing of actions.
*Shogun-like sequencing of action cards in a queue, although only 3-4 of the 11 cards are played. Sequencing can be in any order the player wishes.
*Eve:Conquest-like variable, non-linear player turn/actions--in some cases, 2, 3, or 4 same player actions could be sequenced one-after-another.
*A Game of Thrones-like mechanic of not getting back scoring cards until all three have been played.
*Puerto Rico-like mechanic of added benefit for player who played a specific action:
--Move more ships, instead of one;
--Build as many units as one wants (and can afford), instead of just one;
--Ability to initiate trades with other players, along with trading with bank at 2:1, where other players cannot trade 2:1;
--Ability to determine which of the two resource types listed to generate, possibly locking out other players; and
--Ability to choose what category of scoring--one of two types listed--will occur.
*Galactic Emperor-like random setup of planets and exploration of systems. However, exploring player can look at all planets within a system, only revealing one. 
*Cosmic Encounter-like "board-less" setup.

The game has incorporated many interesting ideas. Planning of actions is the meat of the game, and this is prone to AP, while execution of actions is relatively quick. Game clock is dictated by how desperately the players want to score, so this can be a long, drawn-out affair, or a game that clips along at a rapid pace. Game is initially slow, but quickly mushrooms into a multitude of options and associated payoffs.

Components are good, plastic bits are nicely detailed, but seemingly fragile. Rules are well done, with the example play a must read to get started.

My initial reaction was: "Is this all there is?" commenting on the relative lack of heft in the box, and sparseness of components, and apparent simplicity and look that reminded me of Cosmic Encounter--which I am not very fond of to begin with. However, this belittles the deep, subtle tactical play, and variable paths to victory. We will definitely try this again.

Update (09/20/09) First 4P game: Took roughly 2 hours. We've been spoiled with four action cards for the 3P game. With four players, we now only have three, so more foresight is needed to plan, and greater reliance on other players invoking actions you need. Game is generally easy to teach. Comment for a 4P game is that it  is a very tight game, reminiscent of Castle for All Seasons. There are roughly three general strategies emerging, and now this is becoming a space race, with tight margins. The asymmetric starting forces players to adopt a strategy depending on what planet they start with, so there is very little room for error. 

Update (10/02/09) 5 plays: Taught 3 newbies in 15-20 minutes. New player aids definitely help. Play took roughly 75-90 minutes, as the planning phases were unusually quick--the newbies picked up the game readily, as they were familiar with Settlers.

I have won with three strategies so far: 1) Build two or three terraformers and score; 2) Generate lots of a single resource and score; and 3) Build one or two terraformers, but build more factories and colonies to score. This last game, was a mixture. One other player was keeping up in the terraformer department, so I switched gears and upped the colonies/factories. The last scoring was a few points shy of 50, but since I had the most, the +3 bonus was enough to push it to 51 points and win the game. The game didn't feel as lop-sided as the other games, and felt closer in the point spread. The problem is that if anyone gets a 10+ point lead early on, it is very difficult to catch up; that person could "cruise" to victory, planning scoring cards at every opportunity. The asymmetrical start position means that players will have to adapt. That means that no single strategy necessarily guarantees victory.

Update (10/10/09) 8 plays: Finally played two 5-player games. The game absolutely rocks with five. With four, the game seems to end too quickly, and the path to victory seems too easy to figure out. With three, the game is more leisurely with four action cards per player, and there is more breathing room for all to expand. With five, the systems get cramped very quickly, so movement becomes important, and thus power/energy. With four, I have observed that one doesn't need to play that many movement cards--simply go wherever another player's movement cards point to; there are enough planets to find what you need to begin your "strategy". With five, scoring cards are not played as frequently, as everyone is wary of accelerating the game when everyone is pretty much even. Trade becomes more important with other players, as the 2:1 with the bank feels inefficient, and there are a lot more variety of resources that the other players potentially have. The 5-player game plays in roughly 90 minutes. Overall, the 5-player game feels satisfying; the 3-player is next, as it is leisurely and gives the feel of exploration; and the 4-player seems "broken", as it seems too easy to figure out and exploit the weaknesses of the game, and the game ends too quickly.

Update (10/31/09) 12 plays: This game was in high demand on this game night, as more players are becoming familiar with the game. The new player aides have highlighted that certain player races have advantages (red) and disadvantages (gray), in terms of the production cards. We knew, going into the game, that there were asymmetries among the races, but this could explain why I have had a long winning streak with red, and why the gray player does rather poorly. It is suggested that players select race colors randomly. Also, it is clear that if several races (three to be exact) have the same starting resource planet, then the X/X strategy will become prevalent. I was hoping that these players would keep each other in check, but that particular resource disappeared rather quickly. Also, a unique opening gambit has appeared, as the first player played a scoring card as the first action, and made it X/Y, or dissimilar. All other players were reluctant to give up their starting resources, and the first player ended up with a 5 VP surge for only two cards. Whether that two resource sacrifice was worth it is up for debate, but still the player tied for winning the game (the other was the one that exploited the X/X strategy). The game has a memorable feel to it; practically everybody that I have introduced this game to has reacted positively, if not enthusiastically. I am upping this to a '9'.

Update (11/13/09) 13 plays: Won with the gray race with the starships/systems strategy, and lost miserably with it trying the terraforming strategy. So, it seems clear that each race will have inherently favorable strategies, but also dependent on the resource of the starting planets. I understand that the game may be broken if two or three players all have the same starting resource type planets. The remedy is to randomly assign different and distinct resource planets. However, I still like the challenge of overcoming a lopsided starting position. The cards, especially the action cards, definitely need to be sleeved, as they wear quickly. Also, I am beginning to lean toward reintroducing the '42' and '+10 VP' alien artifact cards, as they would give players greater incentive to land on alien planets--at present, they are mostly ignored.

Update (09/18/10) 30 plays: the game has definitely peaked; it doesn't see the table as often, as people are burned out. We've been playing with the '42' and '+10 VP' alien artifact cards, and two different people have won with the '42' card--one by accident, and the other somewhat deliberately. Although a long shot, one viable strategy is to visit as many alien planets to search for the '42' card, and stay behind on the points track below 42 VP, which is easy to do since resource production will suffer if you pursue this strategy. It requires a bit of finesse, but the 42 VP can be 'dialed in' exactly if you play a X/X:X/Y scoring card in the last action slot of a turn where you think someone will cross the 50 VP threshold. It requires some luck, but if the stars line up, it is a memorable way to win the game.

Update (1/7/11) 39 plays: It seems the starships+systems strategy (along with X/X:X/Y) is unbeatable, except in rare cases where the '+10' alien artifact could cause an upset (which happened recently). Is this all there is? I am beginning to wonder if there are no other significant strategies left to try.

Update (10/10/11): It seems that this game has run its course in popularity. No one wants to play it anymore. I still like it, but there are grumbles when I suggest it. Downgrading to an '8' from a '9'.

Update (07/03/12): Played again after a long hiatus. Solid '8'.

RATING: 4
Everyone's initial comment is "Settlers in Space" and there's a reason for that. The role-selection as replacement for dice-rolling is probably an improvement. It felt like we were all doing our own thing, with little interaction. There is some blocking possible but it never felt like a factor. It is easy for a new player to get screwed by not realizing the importance of Energy early on: you have exactly 2 moves to secure your energy pipeline or you are hosed.

Having 12 action cards in play means it is very difficult to predict what your opponents are going to play or when. In the end I found it wasn't worth trying to follow what they were doing, which contributed to the solitaire feeling.

The person with the most ships scores for that and ALSO will generally score for most systems as well, which on our play felt unfair.

Since it didn't feel like an improvement over Catan, I felt like I might as well just be playing that.

One of my favorites!  I find it very interesting that the length of the game varies greatly depending on how aggressively players use their scoring cards.  I've seen other reviews that claim the game is quick and others that say it runs long - really, it depends entirely on the players.

My only real complaint with the game is that the pieces for the fifth player seem weak compared to the other four.  I think Red has an advantage, but it's not as extreme as Grey's disadvantage.  I suppose you could handicap the player who usually wins by having them play Grey.  We just cap games at four players and just don't play Grey.

...and I'm bad about recording "plays" on this site - I've played this at least 20 times according to other records.

My feelings were well summed-up by [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/444758/a-galaxy-conquering-game-without-the-conquering]KingCroc's review.[/url] 

I loved that it was a space empire building game without shoot 'em ups. Not that I never want to play games with spaceship battles, but it's a nice change of pace to think we'll outgrow that.

In a tactile/component sense, it felt similar to Cosmic Encounter, although that is a very superficial comparison.

Other notes: Plays much longer than 60 minutes, at least for us. Beautiful art (some of my favorite, to be honest). Included player aids could be much better.

Ad Astra is an interesting spin on Catan-like mechanics (I really enjoy the planning phase portion of the game), but the whole affair is too long for having such a high luck component.

This is sort of a Starfarers of Catan light. I like the using your cards to select the type of phase and the order. I don't like how the Start player sits until somebody uses a point scoring mechanism.

My first game, I felt like I was zigging when I should be zagging.  But interesting enough that I'd like to see if I can figure out the strategy of the game.  I wasn't getting the resources I needed, and I was unable to properly compensate for it.  Second game, more of the same.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (December 2011)

As this was a Faiduti and Laget game, I wasn’t expecting much. In general I dislike most of the games from these designers, but the game is pretty good. First of all, Ad Astra features my favorite theme (Space) so it gains bonus points for that. The game components are pretty nice too as is the artwork. The Terraformer minis are great. 

The game is a successful mix between Race for the Galaxy (leaching off other player's actions) and Settlers of Catan (resources you can produce and trade). The fun part is to try to predict what your opponents will do so you can outthink and outmaneuver them.

The game has its fair share of luck, but it can be controlled in many ways so it really doesn’t bother me. 

This is not a game I would like to play very often, but I have enjoyed all my plays of this, so perhaps this can go higher in my personal ratings. I’m downgrading its rating for now to match my feelings with the BGG recommendation system

RATING: 5
Ad Astra has been described as a cross between Catan and Puerto Rico set in space. After playing it, I'd say it is 70% Catan (expansion, production, trading), 15% Puerto Rico (shared actions that act similarly to the roles in PR), and 15% Wallenstein/Shogun (actions are simultaneously pre-planned each turn). That's not a bad mix in theory, but after experiencing it, I would say the game has about 50% of the fun of these other games.

The game felt slightly less than mediocre when playing for the following reasons:

1) It is too long for what it is (2+ hours).

2) Being able to trade 2 for 1 with the bank makes trading far less dynamic and interesting than in other games featuring trades (like Catan). Between players, everything is basically one-for-one with rare exceptions.

3) The scoring is uneven. I especially hate the resource scoring, which strongly encourages ramping up for short, big bursts of points, rather than spending those resources building your empire, such as it is. It makes the game sometimes feel like merely a vehicle for point manipulation. Not very satisfying. This is a game where you SHOULD feel like you are building a little mini empire. The game doesn't really give you that chance.

4) The placing and flipping of cards each turn is a bit slow and grows tedious. Frequently a card has no effect because of the cards played right before it.

I'm not even going to count the uneven bonus cards that any reasonable person would play without. In my first game, I drew the secret 10 point value "instant win" card and graciously set it aside with the comment of "utter crap." Had I not set that card aside, I would have slapped that card down right as the winner was starting to celebrate and said, "In yo face!! Eat my Imperium Rectum Deus Ex baby!! You LOSE, you loser!" Why do designers continue to include these in their games? Does anybody think a surprise like this at the end of the game is fun? There is a similar card in Twilight Struggle that I won that game with and it just ruins the game. I find myself deducting an automatic point for the mere presence of such cards, even if they can be easily omitted. They should never be there in the first place.

I didn't loathe Ad Astra, but neither did I find anything to love or to make me want to explore it further. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Seems to be viewed as a cross between Settlers of Catan, Race for the Galaxy and Puerto Rico. That's three pretty good games to 'borrow' ideas from.

What that does not convey is how well it does it, nearly every bit it does borrow it refines. The end result is a very good game that has not got the attention it deserves.

Rather than just selecting one action per turn, like in Race or PR you get to choose several (usually 3). I thought this might cause bad AP, but so far with the people I have played with it does not seem to.

Everyone places cards face down for their actions. You can also play off other peoples actions. You travel to planets which have resources and build facilities to collect the resources. The resources allow building ships or various buildings. There are also scoring cards to play, but when you play one, you want to have the most of the item to get a scoring bonus. Alien planets can also have various game effects.

BHG auction 2011/12. played this a few times back at blue highway, and i remember enjoying it quite a bit, despite it's length. like the theme and the planet mechanism.

Edit: played again with Adam/Jeff/Josh at the coast. Honestly it was a bit boring at first because it didnt feel like we had much control of anything and mostly people were just producing resources. We did, however, forget to play the rule that allows players to secretly view each planet in a system they travel to. The game turned out to be pretty enjoyable. I think I'll keep it.

edit again: played this two more times since the coast, I'll definitely keep this in my collection. I really like the theme and the planning/reveal mechanism.

Many Euros manage to feel like a boring rehash of older games without it being obvious what games those were exactly. Here the Settlers influence is obvious, but there are plenty of other things going on as well and the result is a new and interesting game.

RATING: 6
Ad Astra mixes action programming with resource generation and player-determined scoring. Think Robo Rally meets Settlers of Catan meets Palaces of Carrara. It's a nice game but I would prefer each of the above for the single mechanisms. Somehow the switch from a slow build-up to frantic scoring didn't feel right although this could be due to playing Ad Astra with only three players where each player gets to program four actions each round vs. only three actions with four or five. My feeling is that it will be better with more players.
I like the simple rules still creating enough depth to provide for difficult decisions and a possibly short playing time for a strategic game if there are no players paralyzed by the programming part. The graphic design and components are good as well.

RATING: 7
The "Settlers in space" comparison is fairly accurate, though if you're thinking about Settlers, the restriction on trading is a little frustrating.  The rules are straightforward and the components and artwork are pleasant.  I've never had a problem with Faidutti as many on BGG seem to, in fact, I usually enjoy most of his designs.

My main gripes with the game are the lack of interaction and the very slow start, which makes it feel a touch too long.  I would still be happy to play, because perhaps further experience would eliminate these problems.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
An engaging role-selection type game, set in space. Its a more streamlined Starfarers of Catan, but with some of the cool storytelling taking out.

In both games, players travel around space setting up colonies in order to produce more resources. Ad Astra has almost no luck as far as resource production goes and the 2:1 trading with the bank is great. The components are well molded but a bit small to handle for my taste. What I like about the game is that everyone can sort of explore space on their own and win in their own way.

RATING: 7.5
Interesting first game, it's basically Catan with improved mechanics (no more dice, thank god!) to please hardcore gamers. At a high level, this is game of short and long term memory where you can double cross you opponents. Since this is Euro, you also have to manage resources (5 types in this particular iteration). The only thing which is random is the starting setup, so far it sounds like random enough to create different games each time but not enough to be a real mess.

The only low point I can think rapidly is the few components are pretty fragile for the price I paid if I compare it with games in that price range. I had to spend 15$+ on sleeve alone because I don't think that these little cards will survive long without them.

One good thing about this game is I was suspecting that the card placement phase would take forever, and generally it did not. On the other hand, the game I played took an hour longer than it should/could have, which made the game really drag. Too bad, I guess I liked it, but it's really hard to tell when you have a bad experience with it.

This game really felt like Settlers and Race wrapped into one to me in a lot of ways. If you are a fan of anything space related you will want to check this one out as you will most definitely enjoy it more than settlers. The one unique thing about this is the mind game that ensues with the actions being selected. If you like to plan what your opponents are going to do and at what spot you will simply love this one as there is no shortage of this in this game. I wouldn't mind playing once or twice more, but don't see much more than that.

Ad Astra does not have enough player interaction to make the game interesting for me. Now the only real interaction is laying down the action cards at beginning of a round and even that is basicly blind bidding & second guessing, which really is not my favorite mechanisms.

The game seems a little too chaotic and unpredictable.  It's hard to understand the likely interactions among all the players' hidden action selections.  Perhaps if there were a gaming group willing to play the game many times, the players could gain enough insight to really outthink and predict each other enough to make it more interesting, but the game up to that point would be rather burdensome.  The game will march to a conclusion as long as some players are using their scoring cards, but the winner may not always feel deserved.  The game also has different problems for each number of players.

This is definitely one of the best Faidutti games out there!  Reminds me quite a bit of Settlers set in space with a tinge of Puerto Rico in choosing role cards, and a hint of RftG in the placement of cards in a row to be completed sequentially as everyone's cards are all placed on the action display and done by everyone.  Win the race to 50 points, stay on top for the rest of the round and you win!  Alien planets bring in a little diversity and chaos - some argue that a couple cards are overpowered but I have no idea since we pretty much avoided the aliens.  Ultimately, I'm still not sure where I fall when rating this game.  There are some pieces I really like, but I feel the trading aspect is pointless except to trade with the bank to get what you need to build or prepare for point scoring cards.  Trading with another person is rare.

An interesting combination of mechanics. The game is enjoyable, but needs more player interaction, even if it is a limited combat system.  The components are pretty good, the artwork is kind of meh to me, but overall the production quality is pretty good, usual for FFG.  Kind of a mishmash of other game mechanics (citadels, and SoC namely), which are put together pretty well. Overall though nothing is really all that compelling in this game.

We celebrated the new year playing Ad Astra for hours, we were tired, sleepy, high, and event though we got tons of fun with this game. Very simple to teach and play but deep and hard to master. Very strategical. The card placement is the key; you must make your move based on what you need of course, but based too on what you expect the  other to do, this may lead to pretty funny hilarious situations! You may feel ist kind of slow at some moments but you are getting fun so you barely care.
And the resources cards are shorter than mini-euro standard. I don't undestand why designers do that, buts not the end of the world.

Don't let others fool you:

This isn't Settlers even though you gather resources and spend them in a similar manner.

This isn't Race just because there's roles for action selection.

The way that this game uses a chart of 12-15 action cards (3-4 per player based on number of players), executing them in order yet applied to the queue by player choice, is a crucial element that changes the entire formula. Given that phases can happen multiple times during a round makes the strategy of the order of your own actions coupled with the guessing game of what others will do even more tense and engaging.

First play was almost 2 hours including explanation. This one needs a much better player aid than what was provided to lower the boundary to entry.

Solid and worth playing again; certainly a 60 minute game AT BEST.

Short duration and quick setup are definite plusses. At first, I expected something epic and similar to TI - if you're looking for something like that, you will be dissapointed. Then again, it's probably the most beautiful game I own. :D

That being said, it has rather smooth and intuitive gameplay that reminds me a little bit of Race for Galaxy (but only little, since the rules for this one are toned down in comparison). My gaming group likes to play it - unfortunately, not as much as CE or CitOW.

Beautiful game that feels isolated and lonely. Not a lot of occasion to interact verbally or through imagery so the game is really quiet and thus a little boring. Sure, you're declaring whether or not you are doing something, but its more on the robotic side. I personally, didn't care for the planned out communal actions that could be both redundant and superfluous. Trading is pretty sparse and feels almost necessary other than to exchange for other resources from the bank because players are waiting for their next known action card. It is indeed important to play the scoring cards, but scoring doesn't feel well deserved, almost by virtue of luck.

A starship game with a bold and beautiful look, built around a brilliant action selection mechanism. Although it is surprisingly quick for a game where you do so much, I felt that we started out with very little - maybe a bit more variable setup might put you into the meaty part of the game faster. On the other hand, I only played once, so what do I know ...

It's an odd complaint for a Faidutti game, but it could be not chaotic enough for me - when I fly starships, I want adventure and freaky stuff, and Ad Astra is actually very brainy and demanding behind its flashy exterior.

Underwhelmed after one partial play.  Too random (planets, mostly) and chaotic (actions).

I'll play it again, probably, but I'm not looking forward to it.  Why not play Race for the Galaxy instead?

Played it again.  The queue aspect reminds me of Killer Bunnies.  I still found it too chaotic, even though I won by keeping my ships and systems up, and scoring early and often.  The margin of victory was probably close to the number of bonus points I got by calling scoring things I knew I could win best in.

2.7 - Variable Phase Order, Simultaneous Action Selection game in Space.

RATING: 7
A space themed resourcing management game that is easy enough to get into but has enough deeper mechanics to make things interesting. 

I love the turn/scoring mechanic of placing cards down on the board, and then executing them in order. The components are top notch and the lack of a game board makes this one pretty cool on the table.

Excellent wee game - sort of settlers meets Race for the Galaxy without the headache. Only takes half a game before you know the basics. The trickiest pat of the game is mastering the scoring cards, when you do they add a lot of punch :-)

RATING: 4
5-p game. It's a decent game, but I just didn't care for it. The placing your actions is annoying and because you can do things on other player's turns, it often doesn't matter what you play.  Way too many card flips where absolutely nothing happens. Less luck than Catan, but more limiting and much less exciting.  

Before the game ended I found myself just not caring and wanting it to be over.  Not a good sign.

RATING: 8
Rating after four plays - 2 4P and 2 5P.  Looking forward to trying this game with 3 also.  I prefer the 4P over the 5P.  Not a game of any real conflict - as in not AT.  The mechanisms are familiar, but work well together.  Game has replay and balance which is indicated in the high rating.  The resource production is the kind of thing that 'fixes' a major issue in Settlers.  (Rating stays after 10 plays)

I would say that this is the esteemed Mr. Faidutti's best game to date (and he has many good games).  And to be fair, Mr. Laget's too, though I have yet to play Mare Nostrum unfortunately.

After more plays rating to 8, still a great game

Probably as close as you can get to "Catan in Space" without Starfarers of Catan (which I still haven't played - can't find a reasonably-priced copy).  Explore, claim planets, establish colonies and factories, collect resources and build some more.  First to the victory point limit wins.  Some unique mechanics like the planning board and the scoring cards (which I actually find a bit extraneous - would rather instant scoring with a lower limit).  A couple surprises in the form of Alien Artifacts.  No direct combat, trading with players.  Not bad, but I'd probably prefer a real Catan in space game.

10/30/10 Played a three-player game. Overall I liked Ad Astra. The graphics are OK, but a little too dark. The components are fine. The theme is good. The designer is well known for always putting chaos in his games (some more than others). If you find this bothersome you may not care for the game as much. I wonder how the game plays with more than three players. I'd be willing to play it again to find out. I rated it a "6" on BGG. The very restrictive trading cost the game a point in my book.

RATING: 6
Shares some similarities to Settlers of Cataan, only in space, beefed up, sans dice rolls and most randomness, and without the bandits. Ad Astra is a lighter 4X title without tech development and no military conflict (which actually would make it a 3X game, if such a denomination existed). Incorporates a set of mechanics--hidden role selection, strategic placement on action initiative track, strategic scoring timing, resource trading, assymetric special powers--that work well together and creates an accessible resource management/empire building game. 

Drawbacks are that the game is slightly difficult to overview with pieces and player models spread willy-nilly in liey of of a proper game board; that the empire in empire-building feels really more like a miniture backyard struggle, and overly long play times for the actual depth offered.

Good resource management and building game, though what really sets it apart is the player interaction in the secret order placement and scoring mechanisms.  You can use other players' orders to achieve your own ends, but you can't depend on them placing what you need. The scoring is quite ingenious, forcing you to both specialize and diversify at the same time, while reacting all the time to the other players' positions.

Really is nothing new here, and though it fits together cleanly, and there is a nice flow to the game play, in the end, it fails to be meaningful or interesting. There's a definitely runaway leader problem as well: I scored an uncontested 20 VP right off the bat and there was no way to stop me. Indeed, from that point on, any time anyone else got VP gain, I continued to benefit, and there was thus no seeming way to close the gap. I dunno - perhaps the other players in our game were all too busy exploring and developing and overlooked the fact that the game is about VP?

Ratings revisedeven lower after 2nd play. Seriously, someone can win by playing a special "42" card? Ha ha, we get it, Douglas Adams was a comic genius, and you want to pay tribute, but here it just created a situation where I felt like I had wasted an hour and a half of my gaming time to have victory stolen from me randomly.

Also, the two-to-one trade-in factor makes it so that no one ever wants to trade with anyone else.
"Hey I have lots of water. Will you trade me some grain?"
"I don't really need water. I will do it a two-to-one."
"Screw that, I can get that rate from the bank!"
And so on. Had they made the bank trade-in rate three-to-one they would have exponentially increased the amount of player interaction.

Hybrid of several games, most notably Settlers of Catan and Puerto Rico, that creates its own feel.  None of the five sub-races of Humanity have names or stories, which makes it feel more generic than I'd have liked.  Rating 9 instead of 10 for two reasons: a slight imbalance in the races' connection to the stars, and the insufficient player aid mats (BGG has much better ones).  I will almost always play this game if it's offered.

Plays smoothly, good interaction even though there's no direct player conflict.
Nice looking components, very thematic.

I originally missed the part where you can freely choose on what slot of the planning track you put your action card. 

In the end, it's very close to Catan, with an action planning similar to RoboRally. I prefer playing this a LOT over Catan.

Keep playing this with the wrong kind of crowd it seems, or at the wrong time... It has yet to show it's full potential.

I think all the Catan comparisons are a little excessive, but it's impossible to deny that there is SOME similarity.  Good game, but the two VP-based alien cards should definitely be removed, and it's really a drag when there's a collective glut of one particular resource at the beginning.

It's like Catan in reverse. You plan your moves first, then everyone executes them. There's trading, resource production, "city" building (spaceships, colonies, terraform), etc.

Sadly, it doesn't hit the table very often.

Some have called Ad Astra "Catan in space," and while there are similarities to Catan, Ad Astra is a different type of experience. Each phase is constructed by performing several different actions that all players collectively chose. If one player choices to "travel" then all players may travel as well. The fun in Ad Astra is attempting to play your actions that will combine well with the actions other players have played. Another fun aspect of Ad Astra is the exploration. The game lay out has you placing planets and moons in no particular order. This gives you free range of movement letting you explore nearly any planet since they are all "equal" distance. I like Ad Astra and would like to explore it some more.

Other than that, the game is brilliant.

The hidden actions thing makes planning difficult. Without knowing what other people plan on doing, you are kind of on your own. I think after more plays this would develop into how people play Race for the Galaxy. You might have an idea of what someone is planning on doing, and leave it out. In our first game, it seems like the build action was used alot more than it was needed. If you're expecting everyone else to use the build action, you can use yours to get resources and score your points.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
First impression (5 players): The game felt a bit of Catan-in-space with Race for the Galaxy action selecting. Everyone chooses 3 actions to be used in a round (15 total in 5p game) but you can use other players actions as well. I really liked scoring mechanic as you must select scoring action (3 cards with couple of choosable ones) but then everyone gets to do scoring and the one getting most points get bonus points. Naturally knowing when the scoring will come gives you a bit of an edge but you still might give more points to others...

Because actions are chosen face down the game is can be pretty chaotic at times but not too much. One thing in our game felt wrong was that starting planets were divided so that 2 + 2 players got similar resources and one got something only for himself. That felt like a huge drawback for this one guy because he can really get 1 production action for the planet only and others have reason to do it twice. A place for house rule if there isn't anything in rules about this...

I really would like to play again, perhaps with 3 or 4 players to see difference but 5 players is a good number for the game.

This is Settlers of Catan on steroids. Instead of a luck fest that dictates your actions (which will sometimes lead to frustration), you can actually try to program your most optimal actions by deducing what others will do.

RATING: 8
On the surface, it looks like Catan: You collect sets of resource cards to build things, and even the trading phase is included. When you get past that, you realize that the actual heart of the game is the ingenious phase selection system. The phase system resembles RftG a bit, in the sense that you choose which phases actually happen during the round, but there are also lots of timing issues to consider. And still it manages to progress at a swift pace and can easily be played in about an hour.

Looks very pretty but the cards are incredibly thin.

Wow! Played a full go with 4 players. Loved discovering some of the possible combos you can do with the action cards.

It should play in about 1 hour with experienced players and I will have to play again with the same group to see how it works. There was a definite tension though, specially at the end when everybody figured out my plan it was a crazy race for points! Gave a sense that no-one was safe! Great fun and everybody loved it after an initial hurdle regarding the cards.

Definitely a keeper though. Great fun and fast-paced play.

This reminds me of Starfarers of Catan a little, because you send your ships out to discover planets and build things there that earn you resources.  The mechanics are a bit different, of course.  There is less trading and more ways to earn victory points, for example.  I actually like this one a bit more than Starfarers, because it's shorter and less fiddly. I think the colors (especially the green and grey) are very difficult to tell apart on the cards and the scoring chips, although the player bits are all right.

This felt a little like a combination between Settlers of Catan and Race for the Galaxy to me.  Everyone had a hand full of action cards they could play, and the action represented by that card was taken by everyone.  For example, if someone played the "produce water" card, everyone that had settlements on water produced it.  It was a nice little game that seemed to reward diversity rather than any particular strategy--you really wanted to leech off of other people's actions.

A really interesting exploration game with a quite familiar resource management. Hate that you can't trade even from bank with any other way than with trade action. 

Ok, I suffered a lot in our 5-player game when I got a totally different starting planet than the rest of players. They all helped each other to receive resources while I struggled to even get something.

The components are high quality and the game looks neat. Player mat should have included the basic production statistics and movement reference. 

After one game it really left me an urge to play more. Whether this is a game which works also with other than 5, I don' know. I hope it does, since that'd be a very strong factor when deciding whether to buy this.

A bit of Kreta, a bit of Robo Ralley, a variety of ways to score and what do you have...an improved Settlers. All of the things I did not enjoy in Settlers have been improved. The game is fun without the dull repetition, the blocking and (very often) the excessive playing time for such a simple game. Ad Astra is fast and fun and significantly, presents the player with some real choices.

[b]Comment:[/b] In many ways, this feels like a much more polished and modern Settlers of Catan, but you know... diceless and in space.

The fantastic thing about this game is that each player has a deck of cards that represent the actions they want to have happen each round. Players in turn order put their cards on the master board, and then everyone resolves everyone's cards from left to right. Some of those cards cause certain types of planets to produce, some cause trade phases to happen and some score based on very specific criteria.

It's an immensely strategic trading/resource management game where you really need to try to figure out what your opponents are up to.

A beautifully enhanced version of Settlers of Catan.  It completely gets rid of the dice mechanic and adds a really interesting planning mechanic, while still keeping the core of Settlers in place.

I love the mix of strategies possible here, and how you can really maximize your points by timing out the scoring cards correctly.  The only downside to this game is that it can end up taking quite a bit of time to get a good game in.

This is a quality mashup of Settlers of Catan and Race for the Galaxy.  I like both those games so this one was kind of a no-brainer.  A word of caution: with 5, it's a bit unbalanced.  (Then again, for some that could be a good thing - it's an easy way to handicap.)

It's out of print... geez! I randomly picked this up years ago after playing someone else's copy. I don't know why, but I really wanted to get it. But anyways... I played it a bit and then shelved it once I thought terraformers were too good. Then I've been asked recently to play it and it was really fun.

I think I really like the game because it has the ease of a Euro, but the hidden card aspect allows you to play off of other people, which is really cool. There is a sense of exploration you get when you visit new places.

Something to note is that the alien technologies seem either really useful or really, really dumb. Winning by getting to 42 points is not going to happen 99% of the time. Also, galaxies getting a random amount of planets seems too unstructured for me. Also, there are differences in player colors. Certain players cannot go to certain galaxies without the help of others. Also, each player has a different arrangement of resources on their action cards.

I suggest people to download the Ad Astra app to help setup games faster. Also, I don't take turns placing action cards face down. What I tell people is to remember their "spots" on the board and place it in increments of the player number. So if I'm playing a 5 player game and I'm first to place, I'd place on 1, 6 and 11. If I'm playing a 3 player game and I go third, I'd place on 3, 6, 9 and 12.

I don't like most Euros, but this one is nice. I should play it more.

The planning stage of this game, where all the players lay out their selections, feels very unique and interesting.  The few times I've played the game I really enjoyed the "guess what other people are going to play and take advantage of it" aspect that this provided.  Even though that mechanism is pretty unique, the "take advantage of other peoples decision" feel that it has isn't.  All said and done though I've enjoyed this game.

RATING: 7
A less confrontational Catan, in space. Really like the use of action cards and travel between systems/planets. Alien Artifact cards can be a little too powerful/random at times, especially the ones involving victory points. Choosing when to play score cards is very important.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Initial impression after one play is a 6, although this rating may change after repeated plays.

I have several issues with this game so far.  First, the alien artifacts are all over the place.  Many of them seem too weak to be worth seeking out.  Some, however, are ridiculously strong (the one that grants +10 points at the games end) or just plain ridiculous ("The 42 points and you win" artifact).  I know the game specifically states you may want to play without these - and from now on I am playing without them.  I think the odds of ending up at 42 when someone else ends the game are very slim - and I don't see any way to "plan" to do it.  In the case of the "add 10 points at the end one" I am wondering why they didn't just make it 5 points.  10 points is one fifth of the points needed to end the game - that is a lot of bonus points for a random event and makes the game end seem arbitrary.

I also feel that the theme is too thin for me.  I love space themes, but there is no tech advancement at all.  There are tons of planet pieces - so much so that there is no competition to settle them - there are plenty for everyone!

It just felt like trying to solve a math equation rather than a space exploration game.  Perhaps I am wishing it to be something other than it was intended to be and with further plays I will enjoy it for what it is. If so, I will upgrade its rating - but for now, I can say its just average.

RATING: N/A
Settlers merged with some Puerto Rico role selection. Is certainly simple enough which is good. The role selection felt like it didn't work quite right: sometimes the shared benefit is very great, other roles it isn't, and this seemed to lead to redundant card plays. Trading didn't work perfectly either though it did tie in neatly with the scoring victory point mechanics. A lot of good stuff, but maybe needed a little more development.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I honestly don't know why I like this game so much. The theme is exciting and fits the exploration and empire building, and all the mechanics work well together, but it's not all that complex a system nor is it especially 'elegant' either. Curious to see a combat modual built for it some day

RATING: 6
Rating based on one play.  The mechanics have been cobbled together from pieces of other well-known games, but the end result is pretty smooth.  I had a good time trying to guess other people's desires, trying to develop a plan and find my way through the chaos.  The best part of the game was the last round.  There was beautiful tension as players each decided their portion of the next 12 moves, and then, "Deal or No Deal" style, the twelve briefcases were opened one by one. I knew what was in the last briefcase, and it was fun watching everyone's faces as it was opened!   

I generally like Faidutti games in theory more than in practice.  I like his approach to chaos and player interaction, but many times his rules are fiddly.  Ad Astra is pretty elegant for Faidutti, and I liked being able to focus on having fun, rather than remembering rules. 

This may not be a fair game.  I have some reservations about the importance of the first planet you're randomly assigned, as well as the importance of lucking into energy quickly.  I'll withhold judgment on those issues until I get in a few more plays.

RATING: 6
I am so tempted to call this Settlers in Space.  A lot of the same going on - acquire resources, trade resources, use resources to build and develop.  What makes this better in my mind is that resource production is a concrete action not at the folly of a die roll.

That said, it has programmed instruction (play desired action cards) as its driving force, so expect the first few turns/games to be a bit long as people get comfortable with their choices and what they wish to play.

Good alternative to Settlers - very similar but less random, less trading, and no blocking. Plays a lot faster. Feels a bit like Race for the Galaxy in that you secretly choose your actions, and then everyone gets a benefit or action off of your choice - ideally, you want to piggyback off other player's action choices, but then choose actions yourself that only help you.

A great alternative to Starfarers of Catan. Eliminates some of the drudgery of bad dice rolls. You must plan your moves before you take actions, and that can create some interesting decisions. The components are pretty good, and the plastic miniatures are a plus. Like others have said, the restrictive trading does seem a bit unintuitive when compared to the freewheeling trade found in a typical Settlers of Catan game.

--Oct2009-- After two plays, I'm still intrigued.  But there's a very real possibility that my game group will consider this played out Real Soon Now.  The problem - as it often is - is that we approach a new game with a set of biases, and when the game proves less that perfectly balanced when played according to our biases we conclude that the game is unstable or unbalanced.

In our most recent outing, one player achieved a far larger score than any other, but still managed to lose on the strength of one of the (delightfully silly) alien artifacts.  Does that mean there's "no catch-up mechanism" or "the rich keep getting richer"?  Not necessarily:  there are definitely a set of in-game mechanisms that we have imperfectly explored.

Űrös, repülős, terraformálós játék. Nagyon jól hangzott a kezdeti szabálymagyarázat, de végül sajnos nem volt felejthetetlen élmény Faudutti sci-fi játéka. A játékosok naprendszerek bolygóit vonják hatalmuk alá és szipolyozzák ki az ott található értékes nyersanyagokat. Akciókártyáinkat egy idősávon helyezzük el sorban, majd végrehajtási fázisban ezeket hajtja végig mindenki, a kártya tulajdonosától kezdve sorban. Az alapjátékban nincs konfliktus, csak gyűjtögetés és építés. Ami nem tetszett a játékban, az a pontozás, ugyanis az is akció. Azaz el kell kapni a számunkra megfelelő pillanatot, amikor a hat pontozható dolgot kiválasztjuk, ugyanis aki az adott területen épp a legtöbb pontot kapja bónuszt is nyer. Nálunk első játék alkalmával rögtön kijött, hogy ez nagyon erősen a vezetőt segítő rendszer. A játék rákfenéje még a szerencse is, azaz az ismeretlen bolygók felfedezésénél, aki pechesebb az olyan lemaradásba kerül, amit nem tud behozni a játék során. Nagyon büntet ilyen tekintetben a játék. Tökéletesen igaz rá, hogy a játékot azonos szinten levő társasozók tudják igazán élvezni, az új játékos csak szenved az első játék alkalmával. Nem igazán tetszett az Ad Astra, ebben a témában sokkal jobb játékok is vannak.

As others have said, this really is Settlers of Catan in space. So much so that it bothers me a tad that there is no homage to Settlers written into the rules credits. But, oh well - that's typical with games, i suppose. So, the reason Ad Astra receives a 7.5 is that all the rules fit together well, and it is fun to play...for a while. It does certainly go on too long for itself, like a story that is very interesting at first but then drags near the end. The fantastic part of the game is the action sequence board: players place their chosen actions (that everyone gets to do, but if its the action you chose, you get a bonus, like Puerto Rico and Race for the Galaxy) in whatever space in the sequence they wish - you can therefore choose to have the chosen action come up earlier or later in the turn. The card-driven action selection mechanic takes much of the luck inherent in Settlers away, which is fabulous, in my opinion. Honestly, if this were a shorter game it would certainly get a much higher rating and replace Settlers as well. As it is, although it is fun, it's hard to want to devote this much time to a game like this one. 

One other note: 60 minute stated play time?? Pfft - if one of the designers cloned himself and played the other in a three player they still couldn't get this down to 60 minutes. They might as well have said 6 minutes...

This is a solid resource management game with an interesting sci-fi theme.  There's some moochalism by guessing at what the other players will play and I like the interaction by having the trading.  Allowing two cards to be traded to the bank minimizes the complexity of trading and keeps it quick.  I'd say it's Settlers of Catan meets Race for the Galaxy and fans of either game will love this one.

UPDATE: Enjoying this more and more with each play, as the blend of mechanics is simple yet the strategy is complex.  An immersive sci-fi experience that is just plain fun.

It's like Settlers (in Space) for gamers: get resources, build stuff, get VP, win. But you don't collect randomly -- it's more like Puerto Rico roles, where you choose actions and get a benefit but everyone else also gets to do the action. Plus, you set up the entire turn with a series of actions, each player placing one of their Race-like cards in one of the many available spots for this turn. Also, everything is a bit more complex than Settlers: you need to build ships that go explore systems where you build colonies which help produce goods and VP; or terraformers for VP only; but you only score when using the appropriate VP action card, which you don't get back into your hand until you've used all of your VP cards. 

Except I'd rather just play Settlers! This was just a bit too long, and I don't enjoy (and am not good at) guessing what other people are going to do -- would rather just do my own thing!

After playing Settlers of Catan, I thought this game won't get me. But it did. First the theme is great and fits the game. You have to carefully plan your actions, it doesn't have that random roll factor, it engages much more strategy for me than Catan. Even though I usually don't like this kind of strategy, this game really got to me and I liked playing it.

Building by collecting sets of resources is reminiscent of Settlers, then having each player secretly select action cards adds a nice twist.  There's an interesting trade-off between scoring and building your engine and you have to be aware of the cards your opponents are likely to play.  The game can end right about the time you've finally built a powerful system!

Plays with a resource model rather like Settlers; phase selection (and leeching) rather like Race for the Galaxy.  I don't know if it's quite as tight a design as Race, but I like it so far.

This reminds me too much of Settlers of Catan. I suffered by not getting any breaks with the resources. My two opponents were receiving twice as many as me. Unfortunately like Catan it's a momentum building game, If you start slow, you have little to no chance of recovering.

Starfarers of Catan in an alternate universe. Instead of taking Settlers and bloating it with a pile of space exporation stuff, Ad Astra takes the core produce/trade/build heart of Settlers and creates a completely different game based on exploration, with all actions programmed and shared.

A few criticisms:

- Player Aids should have a bit more info on them (VP for building Colony/Factory on alien Planet; details of movement costs; Terraform only on Food/Water planet).

- AP-prone players need a few turns to realise they're overthinking things.

- A few components (scoring markers, start player marker) are basically unfit for purpose.

- In a few games we've played players have miscounted scores due to relatively small or hard to see pieces. I'm think of switching from always playing yellow to playing grey. Stealth beats HiVis.

An excellent game -- heavily influenced by Settlers of Catan, with a strong element of RoboRally.  Movement is more flexible than Settlers, and the random dice aspect is replaced by a Robo-esque card sequence Planning Phase.

Once, When I was trying to work out what game to buy next I wrote down what I was looking for in a game (SF theme, exploration, no down-type, low AP, a building game and a few other things that escape me). 

This game had the lot.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I enjoyed this game more than my rating suggests. However thinking over it I feel like the design doesn't do what I want it to. What I see when I play is a dry and fairly long blind bidding game. What I want to see is a more gamified Settlers with exploration, spaceships and aliens.

One major problem is that it rips out the heart of trading in Settlers by only allowing the player who chose that action to trade/be traded with and then doubly so by letting that player trade at 2:1 with the market. What makes this bad is that it is the only interactive phase in the whole game. 

The core mechanism of blindly placing Puetro Rico style actions on an order track allows for some push your luck elements but it also results in some very random weird outcomes that don't feel interesting, and rarely make anyone excited.

Finally there are the alien cards, some of which seem so OP that I struggle to believe that they were playtested. 

Whilst I've been picking on individual yet major systems of the game, I do like much of what it does. I think the movement mechanism is brilliant and the scoring and turn order system is definitely interesting. Exploration works surprisingly well and it's impressive how the game gives a sense of building an empire with so few rules.

I feel like there is a core of a brilliant game in here but everything surrounding it just doesn't sit quite right.

It's basically the same game as Settlers of Catan but with added rules that slows the game down due to unnecessary complexity, sometimes even causing AP. Trading, the best feature of Settlers, is present but seriously wierd/useless due to the 2:1 trading rate in the bank.

Play Settlers of Catan instead!!

If you believe board games are meant to be pure logic and  planning, this game is not for you.

I want to like this game. I really do. In many ways it does Settlers of Catan in space better than Starfarers of Catan. But in the end, I found the game too sprawling, and a bit too chaotic to enjoy. Perhaps another play would change my mind.

The action selection mechanic is interesting, but too clever for its own good. You don't have enough information to predict what the other player are going to do each action in the sequence, which means it doesn't really solve the complaints of randomness in Settlers. I can make educated guesses, but don't find that process really improves gameplay. There is already enough going on to keep me busy. But the action selection mechanic is the only significant way to interfere with other players' plans. Trading is limited. There is no board geography that places you in conflict with another player. In fact, I'm not sure what the "board" really does aside from sprawl out across the table and make it difficult to see exactly what resources each player will be collecting (i.e., the board state was difficult to determine).

What I found really fascinating, though, is that I kept thinking to myself that I'd rather be playing Settlers of Catan right now! Not a good sign.

This had some cool ideas, including a neat twist on the Shogun/Wallenstein action planning mechanic. I love the theme. The bits were disappointing ... it would have been pretty easy to include plastic spaceship minis that were interesting rather than cheap-looking, Ad Astra is pretty unforgiving - the rich get richer and anyone who falls behind is destined to stay there. There's also a huge dollop of luck typical of Bruno Faidutti's games. Sometimes it's charming, but here I found it a bit annoying. I guess this is meant to be a light, chaotic space-colonization game (here somewhat in the mold of Starfarers fo Cataan), but if I'm looking for that, I'll stick with Faidutti's Mission Red Planet, which features plenty of chaos but also has more balance, smoother game play and has all the campy charm that Ad Astra lacks.

Ad Astra rings a little flat for me.  The shared and scheduled action cards hold me at arm's length from the game instead of draw me in.  The raw materials have no unique powers (they might as well just be colors).  The bits and artwork are dry.  The programming board is kind of cool but otherwise this is a standard resource management affair.

Rating after one game. I am not sure if I like it or not because this is one of the games you need to play a few times to discover the best strategy. 

It feels like a mix of Puerto Rico and Settlers. Since you need to switch from resource gathering to terraforming and scoring quickly, I think PR is the "dominant" parent of the game.

This is a very good game if a bit bare bones. I wish there were a bit more meat to it. It can be tough to make a comeback if you fall behind early, and if you go after the alien cards (which can be helpful) you can fail to get a much needed foothold on the resource planets. Get an energy planet asap or you'll be sorry.

RATING: 8
This game plays a lot like Settlers of Catania with a few alterations: you're in space, there are no roads and instead of dice determining resource production, you play action cards. An interesting mechanic employed in this game is that players must plan moves well in advance using a preprogramming method a la Robo Rally (but players plan 15 actions at a time!). this creates quite a bit of randomness which players try to mitigate by guessing at what others will play. It's a fun game and not overly long (also easy to set up & put away). 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
This game is quickly supplanting Settlers of Catan for me for that sort of game.  I like it a lot as a cross between Race For the Galaxy and Settlers of Catan, especially as the randomness in Ad Astra is much less punishing than in Catan.  Generally you're also able to plan ahead more for what you're going to do.

I thought the game was pretty solid, and I'd be interested in seeing it played again with everyone having been through the wringer once.  In our first game literally everyone hoarded resources to score at the end of the final round, which was funny but kind of lame...I don't think that would be the case in a repeat play though.

I think knowledge of how to best use your scoring cards and understanding how to "zig when everyone is zagging" are second level strategy that would get exposed with more plays.

Catan in Space!  This is a space themed game which has a pretty strong trading element.  You're building things on planets to produce goods to trade, ships to explore planets and some bonus buildings for points.  There is a unqiue action selection mechanic where everyone plays cards to the central board but you can choose whether your action will come early or late.  And everyone gets to piggyback off your actions.  There are also scoring cards that can get played to the action board.  This game is all about figuring out what other people are likely to play and taking advantage of that knowledge.  Setting up scoring when you have the majority of the scoring criteria is especially important (and scores you a bonus for having a majority of that criteria).

Plays similar to Settlers, but plays quicker with a neat action framework and a pretty neat scoring mechanism. There's a lot of potential choices on each action card, but rarely is it a difficult decision on which to go for, because you're not going to make a tough choice for yourself in most cases. We played wrong the first time, but when we played with proper setup, it went great.

There's nothing terribly wrong with it, but it really failed to grab me. In particular, it doesn't seem as if there are very many significantly different strategies, at least not viable ones (based on how the scoring works). I am getting rather tired of games where everyone does more or less the same things, but you get to choose the order and maybe a few minor options. Whee.

I am glad that I finally got to play this game. It is like a cross between Catan and Race For The Galaxy, quite chaotic because of the guessing at what other players selected as their actions for the turn, but quite enjoyable. Our first play with 4 players took about 1.5 hours, and that playing time suits this game perfectly. A mistake in the first turn can make it hard to catch up in this game, but again that is no major drawback considering the relatively short playing time. Would love to play again and do things differently.

One play, Essen 2009. A space-themed game without conflict, quite a rare and pleasing thing.  I too liked it, but thought it had a couple of flaws: a player-order advantage, and a lack of a catch-the-leader mechanism. Player [i]n[/i] has a greater chance of benefiting from the action chosen by player [i]n+1[/i] than vice versa.  An engine built early will pull away from the others, and without any penalty such as being cut out of resource trading, won't be caught.

It's not a big thing, but the earlier player is always a step ahead of the later player. What seemed to happen quite often in our game was that player 1 would collect whichever resource that gave him the best advantage, then player 2 would build. Or vice versa. Player three - OK, me - would not be able to take advantage of that build.

The person who plays the most recent scoring card becomes the new first player. I did play an early card, but others people's were played shortly afterwards, and I didn't want to force more scorings as they would have given too many points away.

The development system is important but the game doesn't feel like a clone of Starfarers of Catan. The planning phase ends up becoming the biggest element that flavors the game.

The reputation of "Settlers in Space" is earned.  Components are nice and gameplay is sound, but I was left cold.  This isn't enough more than Settlers to justify the extra time it takes to learn and play this game.  This doesn't even address the concern of the luck-averse about Settlers -- there may be no dice, but there's plenty of chaos to make this unpredictable anyway.  Unless a generic space theme sounds WAY better than a generic old tyme-y theme, this is an easy pass.

(10/09) After one 4p game all newbies - This is a solid "Settlers in Space" type of game.  I like the random set up of systems and planets where there is no "board".

A rather interesting implementation of the exploration game.  It's rather unbalanced, however, as a poor starting planet can be difficult to overcome.

It's possible for one or more systems to be inaccessible if none of the colors with access to those systems are in play.

It's a decent little game - reminds me a bit of Settlers of Catan (yikes) but in a good way. The randomness of the cursed dice is thrown out and hidden role selection is added in.

So we have 1) Hidden role selection 2) Resource gathering 3) Random powerful (alien artifacts) effects

Why don't I love this game? The main thing I saw in it was the resource system itself. You start on a random planet so your "strategy" is built in at best. Trading almost never happens (at least with my group) which cuts down on interaction.

Overall a neat little game but nothing I long to play again anytime soon.

1 play.  Seemed fine.  I wouldn't want to play this with anyone prone to AP.  Light enough that you can have a conversation while playing it.  Those last two statements seem contradictory, but I think the point is that while the game might tempt a certain type of person into deep thought and analysis, either that doesn't really pay off because of the chaotic nature of the game or, even if it does pay off, it would drain the fun out of the game.

Might play again. Interesting concept (almost Settlers of Catan in space), but there doesn't seem to be much in the way of strategy when buying one specific building turns the game into a race to build that item to win, it lacks finesse.

Another play through could prove this wrong.

Game looks great, but our first play felt a bit weird. None of players had any idea how to accomplish their goals. For instance, if you want more resources, you figure you just get more planets that provide that. But that means you have know where such a planet is, and move a ship to it, and then play a card to make it produce resources. I think it'll take a lot more plays before people get the hang of that.

Settlers without dice? Resource collection between the two games is functionally similar; Ad Astra's colonies and factories are exact mirrors of settlements and cities from Settlers, but the timing is based on role selection instead of dice, meaning the biggest collector is the player who arbitrarily benefits most from the group's produce actions as opposed to someone decided explicitly by chance. There's no thief figure in Ad Astra so screw-the-winner - this type of game's faulty balancing mechanism - is implemented only by trade embargo unless someone voluntarily stops producing the resource of which they're the baron to spite the leader. Like Settlers, limited options ensure that strategies are typically identical with one bit of differentiation thrown in for scoring advantage. (Usually during the game players colonize or land a starship on five of the six resources and continue to produce the resource of their starting factory, and depending on that resource breaking the mold by creating an extra starship, terraformer, or colony/factory on a duplicate resource to give them a scoring incentive.)

This game might deserve an 8.  It is a resource management game with a great mechanic for action sequence.

'To the Stars' - This came out a lot in Erie, more than it is here at home.  In any case, it is a good game.  It pays to invest in production facilities that will be fueled by your opponents.

-We play that the initial buildings must all be different.  It is unbalanced otherwise.

I can definitely see why people were disappointed with the listed play time, as this is a much longer game, especially at higher player counts.

I find this a very good game, and look forward to future opportunities to play it again.

Un juego de exploración espacial, para 3 a 5 jugadores. Mucho faroleo (hasta el punto que en el primer turno uno no sabe qué hacer en absoluto). Es un cruce entre Ascending Empires (temática y desarrollo), Catán (fase de comercio) y Shogun (fase de planificación, la más imporante del juego). No gustará a quienes les gusta controlar el juego y planificar a largo plazo, aquí destaca el que mejor se adapta y se anticipa a lo planificado por los demás.

A better Catan than Catan.

I really like some of the concepts in this game... particularly the multiple uses of the cards and the choosing when to score.  My first play felt pretty random but I can already see where more plays would yield a better understanding of how to make the most of other people's actions.  I'm looking forward to trying this one again!

Settlers of Catan with a space exploration theme. It's better than Catan. Ok game

On the long side, with overly complex mechanics for my taste. I enjoy the flavor of the game, as well as the excellent components, but I feel that it could have been streamlined and perhaps added more direct conflict to improve the game.

It's like Settlers, but without dice. There are still some luck involved, but way much less. I like this game, because of it's easy gameplay, but there is also strategy in there. Maybe it's a bit long, and not playable with less than 3 players. I like the artwork and it's a step up from Settlers of Catan. Also it's the favourite game of my brother, maybe because it reminds him of TI3, but he can actually play Ad Astra, because it's almost language independent.
I gave it an 8 because it's better and less luck dependant than Settlers. The artwork is nice. It's not a brain burner, but a rather nice game if you don't want to think so much.

I guess it costed 15900 HUF

High-quality components and an excellent "programming the round" mechanic make for a potentially great game.  (circa 9 rating)

But I never find myself wanting to play it.  (circa 5 rating)  Don't know why; it's not even excessively long. 

So I'm giving it a 7, which averages what I think about Ad Astra and how I feel about Ad Astra.

Especie de Catán ambientado en el espacio. Los jugadores "programan" las acciones que qieren llevar a cabo en la ronda en un tablero común y luego todos las llevan a cabo (pero su dueño tendrá un bono).

Расставлять планетные системы прямо на столе - это круто. Смотрится шикарно. Играется тоже замечательно. Но только разойдешься и начнешь что-то строить - как бац! Конец игры. Тут клювом щелкать нельзя. Все пролетает быстро.

Very good game with lots of choices and decisions throughout.  Beautiful artwork, terrific component quality and you get a lot of material for a very low price.

We played 3 player and at first there seemed to be so much going on in a game lasting only 5 rounds that I thought I'll never manage to achieve everything the game expects of me.

But after a few rounds the fog cleared and I felt able to devise a general strategy which just about scraped me a win (21, 22 and 26 points being the end game scores).

We preferred it to Last Will.  It has much of the same artwork and wooden pieces but seems to do much more with them.

The only downside was how fiddly it is to set up prior to starting.  Lots of decks of cards with similar but different backs to be carefully separated and sorted.

RATING: 7
Interesting mix of worker placement, engine building-then-destroying and Knizia scoring. Good amount of tension as your time runs out and you scrabble to ruin your reputation in whichever area demands it. A couple moderate niggles with it though: 

1. There are a wealth of options available yet many of them are simple 'get X' type actions. In a game with so much going on this could be seen as a positive, but the most involved bits are also my favourites. I suppose what I'm trying to say is that a minority (even if a sizeable one) of the game's playtime is spent doing really interesting things. Everything else was just OK. The cards in particular are uninspired on the whole.

2. Setup, maintenance and takedown is a complete bear, beating out Kanban for the Biggest Faff In My Collection award. Feels like a lot of effort for the game (whereas Lacerda's offerings are worth the investment without question) 

As a whole package it's good and I'll happily play it but will rarely suggest it.

A lovely, fun, light game in the spirit of Last Will. The games don't mesh together at all, so it feels like you're playing three different mini games instead of one game but the theme and art and mechanics are all enjoyable. The addition of Last Will as a module is unique and interesting.

In a similar vain to Last Will in which you're competing to lose as much as you can in each of the competitions. Trying to maintain some balance between the various competitions is fun and challenging but does make the game feel more mechanical and less focused than Last Will. Wonderful artwork. Highly enjoyable game.

Update: 1/28/2016.  Upgraded to a 9 after playing with the possessions board.  It creates a built-in engine, but also has this weird balance of trying to destroy your engine, but not too early.

Played one game with society and politics.  

Pros:
+ Fun theme
+ Love the design and how it is modular which allows 2 or 3 sub-games, and allows you to mix/match.
+ Love how elements from the boards tie together: Renaissance man, other icons in both mini-games.

Cons:
- All cards are played in 4P games.  Very concerned about the replay-ability of the game.

Very nice sequel to Last Will. The theme is, again, reminiscent of P. G. Wodehouse's novels...
Mechanics are quite standard worker placement, and pseudo-set collecting.
The twist, apart for the funny theme, is that you have 2-3 different parts you can youse to try to derail your life. You should focus on one to try to race to ruination (and therefore victory...), but often you need to care for the other parts...

First Play: I expected this to be far more similar to Last Will but it is significantly different. The need to juggle your aim over three area (we played the 3 boards) is a challenge but I think the 2 boards would be a bit dull unless a very short game was needed. Final scores were close. A very clever game.

This game is great! Once again kudous to CGE :) theme is awesome, Jeeves & Wooster soundtrack works perfectly! The game is not easy, it is actually divided into 3 small areas of life that members of The Prodigals Club have. You have to lose everything - money, votes in upcoming election & friends. Sounds great. Watch out - the SMALLEST score wins :P It is not easy to lose points in all parts in the same time. You just have 5 rounds in the game but many, many decisions to make. I mean, this is kind of the game I can play all over again because I feel great trying to make my character drunk all the time, super annoying, loud & controversial in the Hyde Park and the like :D it is so funny - You really feel like playing a role here all the time. It takes much about 90-100 minutes for 2 players.

Wonderful, fun game! Much more interesting and challenging than Last Will, which I found to be just a run-of-the mill worker placement game. This game takes the same idea, but adds a lot of interesting mechanics and ramps up the complexity significantly. 

In Prodigals Club, it almost feels like you're playing several small games at once here: 3 set-collection card games, 3 little area control games, a mini-puzzle game, a mini-economic game. I can see why some people think the game is overwrought or needlessly complex, but I love it. The theme is also fun enough to make the gameplay feel lighthearted and casual despite the meaty decisions.

A bit heavy on the bookkeeping even with the recommended introductory setup as it felt like playing 2 games within 1, I can't imagine trying this with all 3 modules right now. There is a lot going on with this and combined with learning the icons, it took away from the theme as I felt like I was just moving tokens around. I wish they had decided to put text on the cards this time around to help carry over the thematic flavor that was in the rules.

Further, while others seemed to like the fact that the blind draw was removed compared to Last Will, I appreciate the randomness a bit more than most. Lastly, we also used all the cards with 5 players so variability seems a little limited when playing with a full compliment of players. All in all a good game, but not sure one I need considering I own Last Will and enjoy the fact that it is a bit lighter.

With a 3 hour learning game with 5 it went on long and I don't think I need to own both this or Last Will. One or the other is enough and Last Will because it is a bit lighter to me may be it.

Players are ungrateful, entitled 18th century knobs who think it's funny to lose it all.  

Amusing game where players set out to destroy their personal prospects in three spheres - politics, society and finances.  It is a worker placement game where you set up a reverse engine that consumes your assets as fast as possible.  It is obviously a cousin to Last Will, and indeed you can combine the two games together.

Funny - enjoyed a few plays of it, but not a keeper.

Played at BGGcon 2015. 

You put out your workers to get different cards and symbols to build a point-losing engine. The idea is you're a wealthy socialite and you're trying to lose standing with your friends and not be voted to a political office. So you use your engine to advance your points down both the political track and the social track, and the highest score from either of them is your final score after 5 rounds.

Good theme but I'm not sure if the mechanics supported it well enough.

I thought I would like this more than Last Will, but I like it pretty much just the same, meaning happy to play it but don't need to own it.  It adds complexity to the Last Will idea without really adding any depth.  The theming is great, as is the art (although I wish there were more different pictures for the cards).  Yes somehow the game still feels somewhat mechanical and uninspired to me.

RATING: 7
A solid sequel to Last Will, which takes the refined engine-building of that game and breaks it down into more of a puzzle game.   The "friendship" board is the most puzzly of the modules, although the tiny chits are a bit fragile and easily bumped around.   The "politics" board is perhaps the least interesting to me.    The "possessions" board is essentially an antique buying/trading/selling game, and I liked it.  It didn't feel "just like a simple Last Will" to me.   

Overall, things are bit more abstracted here.   The theme isn't as strong, although the comedy is still there.   I enjoy it quite a bit, although I think Last Will is a bit stronger and more intuitive.

Didn't stood out.

+ not obvious worker placement
+ some unique and interesting mechanics
+ nice theme

- actions to pick are shown at the beginning of a round (You could be very lucky or just overcommitted first player)
- seems to have some card combos that are hard to compete

Liked the idea of the game. Rahdo runthrough made me feel like I needed it, so I got it. We love WP but every time I tried to learn the rules and symbols to teach it I never really felt it so we played the other WP games we know and love.  Ended up in a math trade to a good home where I hope it gets played.

Prodigal's Club offers three different modules, which all intertwine and tax players in a unique way. The politics module has players seeking political connections and control of the press. The possessions module revolves around well-timed trading and selling of assets. And the reputation module is an order of operations puzzle of social decline. All of this is in a effort to rid yourself of all political power, material wealth, and social reputation. Each module interacts with the others in unique ways, but it should be noted that the game is best played with only two of the three modules. This helps alleviate replayability concerns, and grants each play a different focus, and exacerbates action scarcity. Iconography runs rampant, and the pursuit for the ideal order-of-operations can induce minor A.P. But,  Prodigal's was seemingly built for the way my brain processes puzzles, and as a result I greatly enjoy diving in for more.

Knizia type scoring, which like a lot. A little too tactical for a long game like this. It's quite random where you can use the different symbols. It all depends on the cards you will be able to acquire the next round. The worker placement mechanism is quite standard.

Várakozásaimmal ellentétben nem igazán tekinthető a last will utódjának, mivel jóval komplexebb lett, viszont ezzel együtt kiveszett belőle az eredetire jellemző szellemes tematika. Néhol még euro gémhez képest is kifejezetten absztakt lett. Szerintem mindenki másra számít, amikor megveszi, így valószínűleg sokaknak csalódást fog okozna, annak ellenére, hogy önmagában nézve nem egy rosszul sikerült darab.

Pár plusz játék és a háromtáblás variáns után azt mondom, hogy ez egy korrekt, jól sikerült darab. Néhol kicsit túl absztrakt, de vannak benne egyedi mechanizmusok és végig agyalós, izgalmas a játékmenet.

Amusing race-to-the-bottom theme, and charming illustrations. 

Mechanically, just a race with a little engine-building that's dependent on cards revealed at the start of each round, which makes the conflict of manipulating turn order important, but only if you have the contents of the decks memorized to know when the cards you need are coming up. Focus on one symbol to maximize your engine output in two of the three games areas, then complete your third area manually.

Very solid game.  There is some general resemblance to 'Last Will' (by the same designer) but it's better than LW.  More tension and more dimensions.

I've played: 2- , 3-module games and the game combined with 'Last Will'.  The last mode was the weakest one and I'm not repeating it any more (too much fuss for too little return).

I wish that there was a wider selection of cards.  As it is now, ALL cards come into play every time.  It can become the issue (replayability) after repeated plays.  I hope not.
I guess the designer's intention was to reduce the randomness, but some variety between games should also be present...

EDIT: It's a bit too long with 4 players (not to mention 5...).  The smoothness is gone then and the part of enjoyment along with it...  Consequently the rating lowered to 7.5.

EDIT2: Sadly, the game has burnt out for me after 6 plays :(  I feel there is nothing to explore for me any more and the subsquent games are similar to each other,
Still, a solid design and therefore  the rating '7' stands.

Sold.

I definitely found this an improvement over Last Will. The fact that there are now three different arenas in which to lose everything you have and they all can have slight influence on each other makes the game more interesting. Each area provides a different way of gaining various symbols and also different cards which give you losses based on the symbols you have, so coordinating the two or three (depending on how many you're playing with) areas is essential. My favorite one is the society section, since there's a decent puzzle aspect to a lot of the effects, where if you have things in certain configurations you can get bigger benefits and if you have things in other configurations you get penalties. The other two areas are more straightforward, the votes area has a majority competition every round and the properties area is all about buy high sell low.

But it's also great how your score is just the area you're still highest in, so you do really need to work toward pushing everything down equally. this enhances the feeling of needing to coordinate. The one downside is that the game's a little lighter and two of the three areas are a little more straightforward than I'd like.

RATING: 8
1st game: 5 player with just red/green modules, almost traded the game immediately. 

This game should never be played without the yellow module (properties) since your starting buildings have symbols on which kick off your engine. The green module allows you to build an engine with the green tiles, but it takes a few turns, and the red module only gives temporary symbols. Of course all 3 modules have their own unique cards.

I also don't think it should be played with only 2 modules, it's much more interesting with 3, and more cards being available gives you more control in the direction that you want to go.

As for player count, the less players there are, the more cards everyone will be able to take and thus the more control everyone will have in building a coherent strategy. I won't play it 5p player again, 3p was great, 4p will probably be ok. 

It's a very good game, perhaps a little short, It's different to Last will in that the cards are all open information, and that there's no action limit, otherwise it's a very enjoyable and interesting game in it's own right.

[floatleft][ImageID=2684453][/floatleft]The structure of the game is very straightforward, there is a worker placement phase where players take turns claiming cards and actions. The actions claimed are performed immediately, the cards are kept in hand. Once all players have placed their workers they take turns playing cards from their hands, and using cards they have previously played. A player does all the card activation they want before the next player does any. The game is played over 5 rounds, or possibly fewer if someone hits 0 in a competition.

There are three game boards each dealing with a specific competition, thematically they are an election, social standing, and wealth/possessions. You start the game with many votes, people of high society like you, and you have money and shiny things. Your goal is to lose votes, destroy your reputation, and divest yourself of monetary value. Your score comes from whichever of these competitions you are doing the worst at, e.g. if I have 15 votes, 3 social standing, and -5 monetary value my score is 15. Therefore to do well you must balance your efforts in all three competitions. 

[center][ImageID=2684466 medium][/center]

A large part of good play comes from piecing together an engine. Several cards will give you a benefit for each symbol you have of a particular type. Some of the symbols are: horse, dog, wagon, and wine glass. So for example you may have a card that allows you to lose a vote for each horse symbol you have. Each of the competitions can grant you symbols. In the election competition you start with zero symbols, but can gain tiles which when collected smartly can give you symbols for the rest of the game. In the possessions competition you start with many symbols, but they are on possessions which you must get rid of before the end of the game. In the society competition you need to keep your social standing tokens in certain positions in order to gain symbols, however, you always want to move these tokens downward, so managing which symbols you gain is very tricky. 

What I love about the game is the ambiguity of which move is better, and the struggle to prioritize the three competitions. In general losing more of something is better, but as you build an engine to help with one aspect you've necessarily neglected another. On top of that you have to deconstruct parts of your engine as you sell possessions and lose social standing. I prefer the three competition game because it intensifies both of these elements. The two competition game is still good, notably it's shorter, but unless you want to ease someone into the full game I don't think I'd recommend it.

Given the similarity of theme, designer, and mechanisms I think I should highlight the differences between Prodigals Club and Last Will.  
1) Unlike Last Will there is no action point economy, cards are free to play. Last Will has some worker placement but the action phase is the more important aspect of the game. In Prodigals Club it's the worker placement that dominates, you have more workers and there are many more options. 
2) Cards are drawn blindly in Last Will. In Prodigals Club they are on display and you spend a worker to grab one, two, or three card piles. This is the predominant source of player interaction, and makes turn order very important which you can manipulate with a worker placement.
3) Prodigals Club is more complex. Last Will with it's single purpose engine building offers less agonizing decisions. Card combos remain important in both games but in Prodigals Club you constantly feel torn between the different competitions, even though the action phase is more streamlined you end up with more cognitive load.

I really enjoy Prodigals Club, I find it challenging, in particular the mini-game of managing your social standing is painful and fun. I prefer the theme of Last Will, as perverse as the competition in that game is it's a lot more believable than what Prodigals Club offers. I do think that the cards do a wonderful job of conveying the theme, the art is cute and sometimes quite funny.

I love the idea of the game. Loosing everything. And the game play is really nice. Unfortunately you only have one set of cards. So you will always get the same set of cards. Only in a different order. It would be nice to have more cards so that you have to randomly take the number of cards you need.

2018-01-02 - 5 - I didn't like it too much. I took us way too long (with 5 players). Theme is funny, but not too connected with the mechanisms and after a while you start seeing only the symbols. Worker placement is rather typical here and there is bunch of artificial balancing mechanisms as the political tokens and popularity track. 
Rather not for me but convinced I could play it again (with less than 5).

FIRST IMPRESSION:

First play was with four and we used all three modules. It was quite a different game from Last Will while carrying a similar theme - but theme doesn't necessarily come across as strongly. This game is about balancing your efforts in three areas as your score is the value of the highest in the three areas a la Ingenious. The game play is rather simple and the symbology isn't too bad. Takes a play to learn the cards and understand the game play more. Curious to try combined with Last Will at some point. This is definitely more of a puzzler and "thinky" game than Last Will. Feels like it takes longer as well although I'm not sure it really does.

I'd call this an attempt at making Last Will heavier, and trying to vary the system. Overall, I'd call it successful. However, There are times when the game begins to verge on the actual work you are setting about to do in the game itself, but still rides the line of game + fun successfully. I do think it's a bit long though.

A funny theme with some nice sub-games.

The bookeeping is quite heavy - first during the ardous setup phase, then between each round. This is clearly another CGE game developed digitally, which inevitably causes  inelegancies, exeptions and sub-rules, and the aforementioned bookeeping (which obviously wouldn't be felt at all in a digital version).

My rating may yet rise ... and it may drop too.

Last Will revisited. I was not really waiting for that. Lots of calculating, and waiting for others to finish their calculation. Especially near the end of the game. 
A lot of setup for a rather thin game, that does leave you a lot of options. 
Last Will was thematically fun, for one time. I don't need a second version. 

Minus: 3 (high downtime) - 5 - 6 - 8 (not interesting enough, after Last Will, to bother)

Good design, not a bad game, mechanically similar to Last Will. Workerplacement, get rid of your stuff in three different departments, three tracks, balance them. Build engines etc. All in all not bad as said, but not a warm that gets me very enthusiastic either. A lot of fuss and puzzling in order to get a few coins less. Much a do about very little decrease of your wealth. And our first game of 4 players took way too long for what it is: 3 hours.

A less clunky version of Last Will with the same humourous theming.
The iconography is somewhat confusing (even to experienced gamers) and coupled with a muddled rulebook (no contents description, lack of detailed card descriptions) made the first play somewhat a struggle.
Nevertheless it is a solid game but as it does not offer anything particularly new I traded it.

心得:
有三個競賽彼此之前主要是靠一些符號互相影響
之間互相影響的部分做得不錯
資產模組部分也跟之前的last will差蠻多的
算是有新意
要算也是可以算蠻多的遊戲
但是還不會複雜到不能負荷
還不錯
規則:
*遊戲設置三種競賽選兩個或是全選(中央圖板要放對應面)，並選擇對應人數面，社會左上，投票右上，資產下方，放回合標記跟商人標記，放對應競賽的額外行動標記，使用對應競賽的中央卡，白色深色各自洗勻，深色在上面，每輪開一張，每種競賽對應卡牌洗勻(深色白色分開)蓋著放對應圖板附近，所以板塊先依正面分類(一個標記跟兩個標記的)洗勻，然後一個標記的放上面，各牌庫也依一樣的方法洗勻
*社會圖板放老太婆板塊洗勻
*選舉圖板上面放選票記錄板，旁邊放政策圈板塊，每輪開始補滿
*資產圖板，放區域標記指隨機區，旁邊放資產板塊，每輪開始補滿
*每個人拿一個顏色圖板跟工人(5/4/3工人，2/3/4人，如果三個競賽都用在加一個)根據人數跟競賽拿取對應起始資產(2:10元6資產卡/42投票，隨機背面無圖政策圈板塊/16-16-16-14，3:4元6資產卡/37投票，隨機背面無圖政策圈板塊/14-14-12-12，4:4元5資產卡(少5元卡)/30投票，隨機背面無圖政策圈板塊/14-12-10-10)，隨機起始，照起始順序拿補償，依序遞減(多1元/多一票/最右邊上移一格)，每在一個人前面就要選一個，可重複選
*遊戲進行五輪(六階段)或是有人某項競賽到0則遊戲結束，所有競賽中分數最高的為他的分數，最低分獲勝
1.設置 每個圖版補對應卡牌(都開著)，多張的位置每張都可以看，打開中央卡，每個版塊補充對應版塊或是開老太婆版塊
2.擺工人 輪流一個一個放，直接執行對應動作，可不做事(除買賣資產有的話一定要執行一次)
3.行動 可使用手牌，沒有限制張數，白色卡一次性使用，黑色打在圖版每回合啟動一次(上限六張)，右上角是啟動功能，下方是被動功能，也可使拿到的額外行動版塊，使用完放回原位
>中央圖版三競賽時放一個工人就拿牌，兩競賽時要一次放兩個工人，等到所有人都pass才能拿第二個工人擺
>順位軌擺了可指定下回合順位，同時拿額外行動版塊
>商人版塊 該回合可指定他成為任意兩個符號(可重複)指定後就不能改了
*資產競賽 區指針每回合轉一格，該類型建築物該回合賣時少1元
>交換資產動作 並減少多少錢，如果超過上限就要拿現金
>如果一次賣兩棟，價格減免兩棟都有效
*投票競賽
>拿政策圈版塊時要能跟自己現有的拼起來，當拼起來時獲得對應標記，每次形成2x2時可獲得兩個獎勵(扣一票/少一元/下移一格)
>pub 卡出越多張效果越強
*社會競賽
>移動時該格要沒有其他標記且不能移出版外
>有一格可忽視老太婆的加分影響
4.海德公園 有玩投票競賽時，此階段計算所有喇叭數，最少的加1票，之後照順位減對應票數
5.老太婆 根據開的版塊移動標記向上，如果該移動的被擋到，則擋的也上移
6.結束 確認是否達到結束條件，重排順位，每人手牌上限到4，版上牌跟版塊清空，所有商人獎勵行動版塊回圖版，移動回合標記跟轉資產版塊指針一格
*記分 資產競賽每個剩下資產版塊+3元換現金，沒資產金錢可以記錄到負的，投票競賽分數可以到負的，社會競賽分數是四個版塊總和，最後競賽中最高分的為玩家分數，最低分的獲勝，平手比次高分

I liked Last Will and this is made of the same cloth. There's lots of areas to focus on, and the timing of when to focus on each aspect as opportunity presents (and is occasionally forced) is much of the game. There's an iconography learning curve but it seems rather clean with a game under the belt.There are lots of interesting decisions to make and lots of ways to go about things, and the fact that there are multiple modes of play lends further attraction.

The Prodigals Club is a successor to Last Will (and can actually incorporate Last Will as an expansion if you're totally nuts), and the game has the same overall feel. Here, there are three different modules that you're trying to tank in--possessions, votes, and personal influence. Whichever you still have the most of at the end of the game is your final score, so you can't really focus on one thing. Like Last Will, the items you have often help your engine run, so you have to build up and take apart your engine as the game progresses. Because you need to simultaneously work on three different things, there is less in the way of card combos, but it is fun trying to balance everything. I think I still like Last Will better, but I found this to be pretty enjoyable as a somewhat different take.

Really like this one. We've now played all three modules, and they're all interesting. The possessions one feels a lot like Last Will (if I got it right, you can put it in that slot), the other ones don't really. All of them offer nice puzzles on how to lose everything. Really want to try this with all three modules now!

RATING: 8
A worthy cousin of Last Will. Theme is similar but game is split into 3 modules that can be played altogether. I like how each module is a mini game as they operate with different mechanics. Scoring is like Between Two Cities whereby you need to balance you scores for the modules as your final score is the highest score of the modules you are playing and the person with the lowest high score wins!
Game length is kept short by having only 5 rounds to execute your plan on when any one of the module's scores reaches 0 for any player.
Tried it with 2 modules, keen on 3 modules altogether.

You could call this Last Will+ as now you have to get rid of 2 or 3 things. Then again, as you don't have to count your actions anymore, it's a bit more simple. And as it recycles some principles of Last Will (which is logic to be compatible with Last Will) and certainly artwork, it doesn't feel so refreshing/innovative as Last Will did. But overall still a good game, definitely a keeper in the collection.

I am not a fan of Last Will, but I am a fan of this. I guess both games can be played together, so that might be cool for gamers who enjoy both. It has a similar feeling that you are trying to lose reputation and lose all your money as best you can. This game there are 2 paths you could take but you score is the HIGHER one of the 2- so you really have to try and do both as best you can, since you want the lower score. 

Very interesting and awesome components!  I look forward to playing again soon!

This game had some really good variations to the normal worker placement game. First, you had to lose everything in three categories. Which ever area you fail to lose the most in is the area you score for the end game. That means you can't min/max. You have to develop an engine and work to get every are down under 10 points, at least, to hang with good players. I got my butt whooped, but it was a refreshing theme and had new mechanics that made for good times. Would love to play again.

[u]The Positive[/u]
(+) Interesting story behind the game: trying to destroy your wealth and social and political standing

(+) Lots of nice components: wooden hats to take actions, nice big cards, ...

(+) The game is relatively easy to teach

(+) Some engine building opportunities (however, this can be somewhat luck dependent) with the nice dynamic that in 2 out of 3 competitions you have to 'break down' on your engine in order to win. For example: getting rid of a possession tile is necessary in order to decrease your wealth, but it also deprives you of a symbol which you can use in your engine to do well in certain other competitions. This really is the charm of the game and creates a certain amount of (positive) tension

(+) Good design choice to base the end score on the sub-competition on which you did the worst job. This forces players to be involved with each and every competition. This system is similar to 'Tigris and Euphrates'. 

[u]The negative[/u]
(-) This game suffers from a severe identity crisis. It involves too much 'counting' and maching symbols and too few thematically involved action possibilities to be a lighthearted game, but it also doesn't offer enough deep and meaningful gameplay to be a succesful heavier game.

(-) The story behind the game is very original, but it doesn't shine through in the game play. You don't feel like you are scheming to offend high society or planning to lose votes. You feel like you are waiting for the right type of cards or tiles to come out and to match the right symbols.

(-) Gameplay is rather uncreative and dull. Despite the nice 'breaking down on your engine'-dynamic, the main part of the game involves a flat and rather boring worker placement system.

(-) Although new cards are dealt face up each round, there still is too much randomness in the game. Really, the entire game revolves around mixing and matching symbols or cards. The way cards and tiles become available (all at once in one round, early in the game, late in the game, ...) will make or break your strategy.

(-) It is a somewhat annoying to have to keep counting out your three scores on all three competitions. Due to cards linking all competition this quickly becomes a rather unsatisfying and dull activity, feeling more like work than play. Imagine you should not only be assessing this for yourself, but also for your opponents and after a short while you will quickly no longer care, making player interaction totally random and for the most part absent.

[u]Conclusion:[/u]
This is a nice production offering quite some content for its price. It's main charm is the engine building aspect while the game will force you to start breaking down on your engine sooner or later. However, I don't see a reason to pick this game over many other better games. If you want a deep and involved strategy game, The Prodigals Club will not deliver due to rather uninspired mechanics and a rather high randomness-factor. If you are looking for a fun lighthearted game, this title also fails to deliver as its story doesn't come through enough while playing and it involved too much fiddly calculus and 'looking for symbols'. Its fiddly nature and its lack of real strategic planning opportunities will disappoint light and heavy gamers alike. I had hoped 'The Prodigals Club' would serve as some sort of gateway getting heavy and light gamers together around the table to enjoy a fun game which offers some opportunities for strategic planning so all would enjoy - but unfortunately, I don't see this magic happening. Another new game from this year 'Persuit of Happiness' would probably cover this prerequisite better, delivering real storytelling and offering a (limited) amount of strategic planning and tactical moves.

[u]Tips:[/u]
(*) The political subgame is very valuable to aquire symbols. Matching symbols on political tiles offers symbols you are sure not to lose during the course of the game.
(*) Focus equally on all competitions, or try to get a card on the main board to compensate a really good job on one competition for a worse job in another
(*) The game doesn't offer many different ways to lose money. Keep your eyes open for really useful white cards in this competition.

[u]Gaming time:[/u]
Approx playing time with all 3 competitions in play: 30 min / player.

Worker-placement game about rich people trying to ruin themselves, expressed as trying to lower your score in each of three different areas, with your final score equal to your highest subarea and low score wins.  In practice, this is identical to an increasing score.  In contrast to a lot of worker placement games where you feel like you don't have enough actions, the last action in a round typically felt low-value, with the high-value options gone and lots of remaining choices that offered minimal benefit.  Setup was a pain, with thirteen different-backed mini-decks that need to be sorted out, plus a bunch of tokens and tiles.

I bloody love this game. Even as someone who's not a great fan of worker placement this game only fills me with admiration for the design. It moves at a rapid clip, even with 5 players, and is full of very tough choices.

A game I suspect I will only admire, rather than love, although I would probably choose it over Last Will every time, simply because the decisions seem more interesting and fun.
I haven't played with all three modules yet; I suspect my brain would explode.

There are some cool ideas in The Prodigals Club, but I just don't find it as engaging or exciting as other options. Noting about it really grabbed me.

These thoughts about the The Prodigals Club are based on playing the “basic game” (Society and Election modules only) with 5 players… The premise of trying to offend high society to lose an election and anger influential people sounds like it should be a fun and easy thing to do, but it actually turns out to require quite a bit of thought and effort when trying to do so through skillful game play. I guess the competitive struggle is supposed to mirror the turmoil and disappointment that would come with the territory if one actually tried to do this in real life. At any rate, The Prodigals Club combines a basic worker placement mechanism with strategic card play combinations and tactical track manipulation to determine which player is the best of the worst (or is it the the worst of the best?!). The selection of game play mechanisms is very interesting and work quite well together, but determining the optimal card synergy and how best to manipulate the influence tokens become an intense order of operations puzzle of that can lead to some analysis paralysis at times. This made the game seem more like work and less like play and didn’t jive with the theme for me. It also causes the game to play longer than I would have liked even when only using two of the modules (albeit we played with 5 players). The modular design that allows for various player counts and various game board configuration is fascinating though and I’d like to explore The Prodigals Club further, but perhaps with fewer players.

1 play, 2er

Cool worker placement game along the lines of Last Will, but oddly both simpler and more complex. Simpler, in that there are no action points to deal with, turn order is JUST turn order, and I think the cards are mostly more straightforward. And more complex: there are now 3 boards to work on (splitting your focus), there are more types of cards, and you can get a huge hand of cards so it's harder to plan your sequence of card play (the icon counts change as you take the actions themselves so you have to do your stuff in just the right order).

Fun game, but the theme doesn't quite mesh. If you can score negative in everything, what's the difference between spending all your money and just making a lot of money? None.

I expected more from this game... :(
I played just once, but I wasn't amazed. It was dull and mathy. The theme is interesting, but you can't feel it during the gameplay. Maybe the big brother (Last Will) is better? I should try.

I wasn't particularly fond of Last Will, which is the predecessor to this game. The Prodigals Club, on the other hand, I enjoyed quite a bit. It is built on the same premise as Last Will, namely doing losing stuff on purpose. The difference is that players in Last Will only had to lose money, they now have to lose money, an election and respect in society. This makes the game a lot meatier. 

What I did not like about Last Will, was that I felt it was mainly a game about drawing cards, hoping for the best. While drawing cards in an integral part of the Prodigals Club as well, it adds a few layers of depth to it all, balancing it out with a number of other mechanisms.

Sister game to Last Will, AKA the Brewster's Millions game, where players are attempting to lose not only money but the respect of society and an election. There are three modules, of which either 2 or 3 can be used, and rules for using Last Will itself as module #4.

Each module has slightly different minigames and scoring, but essentially inherits the Last Will mechanisms of card synergy, boosting actions by collecting specific symbols, and one-off vs persistent card effects. It's generic euro through-and-through but the theme is fun and the mechanisms do work. 

I have only played the "Standard Game" with 2 modules (Society + Election) and five players and was not particularly impressed; useful combinations of symbols+cards were too difficult to come by so "strategy" was not the watchword. It seems likely that this was partly because of the missing Possessions module; other comments here do suggest that the full game is far better and I can see why it would be.

Need to try the full game.

A worker placement game about losing money, reputation and votes. Seems like a very tight and interesting design from my two games played. The scores are normally very close, so that's another positive. A good one.

Wow what a game! This is Last Will 2.0. I didn't like Last Will because it felt like it had a few problems (the card mechanic didn't flow with the rest of the game and was too random) but The Prodigals Club feels solid.

Everything just works. This stands out from other worker placement games because it feels like a series of puzzles. The society competition has you moving markers down different tracks to get bonuses and avoid penalties at different times. There is an element where you build a set of tiles, matching along the edges, to try to make certain sets of symbols.

The game has a nice flow to it and should play out quickly once everyone knows it. Also, there's a ton of variety because the game comes with three competitions and you only use two per game. Each competition has its own rules and components.

I need more plays to tell for sure, but I can't really see any negatives and this one seems like a keeper.

A very fun and satisfying game. The theme is pretty cool but even better are the awesome combos you get to make with all your Cards every round. You really feel like you are doing something and the fact that you can set up different combinations of competitions creates a lot of nice variety.

A really, engaging and challenging game; the puzzle of trying to reduce your points on three different systems provides some amazingly fun and difficult decisions. And we absolutely love the theme of trying to get the lowest because it’s so different from other games.

The illustration and production quality is good—especially the workers being top hats!

Last Will gets an upgrade from this sequel/expansion. Along with Last Will it plays like a cross with Dungeon Petz and Magic. Oversimplification, just how it feels to me. I like the balance of trying to lose wealth AND not gain votes/popularity. That is a fun frustration when everyone else is trying to accomplish the same. It still drives me crazy to make decisions that waste and throw away value even though it is all in fun and only a game.

An absolute hit in our game group. The artwork and storyline is a lot of fun and the game play stays exciting until the last round since you have to try to streamline all your three modules. Very good strategy game with a bit of luck thrown in when others grab the one card you needed so much.

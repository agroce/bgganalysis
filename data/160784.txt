Fun filler game, best with 3 or 4 people but plays well with 2. A card-moving game in which each card lets you move some other cards around, gives you different options for scoring, and generally provides a variety of decisions with each hand.

Played once with 4. Left no real impression on me. I feel like it maybe felt a bit long between turns and that the board state was destroyed between each turn, so winning or losing was effectively random. But that's assuming my memory is correct.

Might be better as a two player game.

I had hoped that this would be a nice slightly chaotic filler with a bit of strategic depth. What I found was a fairly luck based game where you just had to draw well and use the cards you are given. You can quite easily be in a position where you know what your opponent is trying to set up but can do nothing about it.

This hand management card game has players place character cards in various city locations and use their special actions in order to manipulate other cards to score secret objective cards for points.  The more you are able to manipulate the cards the more interesting and fun the game becomes.

Fun concept and easy gameplay, but game can become a quagmire of "take that" if the game gets too competitive. Some cards are too powerful and really can bog the game down. Would be a fun occasional play, but not something that can make it too the table too often.

This is a fairly light weight game and could be considered a filler game.  It is about a 30 minute game.  I've only played with 2 players.  This game is more tactics than long term strategy because of the movement of the cards by other players.  It can have some luck in drawing goal cards later in the game that are very easy to complete. But considering that it is such a quick game and is fun to play, it doesn't really matter if you lose a game because somebody else just got lucky that game.  Play another.

It's a bit chaotic for my taste.  I like games that are more strategic.  However I would be willing to play again.  Several questions came up during play which is typical of card games where the cards do a lot of different things.  Does the commander stay at the location after he sends others away.  Can other characters be "moved" (not played) to the Brute's location?  Can a missio card be completed when a card is played but before the action is played?  That kind of stuff.

One thing that did bug me is I had a heck of a time trying to figure out what the 8 "expansion" cards were. Ultimately, I think there may only be 4 of them...maybe a misprint in the rulebook...or I'm missing cards.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
You manipulate cards on the table to achieve secret VP conditions, but there are so many that it's impossible to know what goal another player has, so defense is impossible.  And since some goals are worth considerably more points than others but aren't more difficult to complete as the game goes on, it just comes down to luck that you get the good ones.

Unless each player is familiar with the different Missio cards, the deduction mechanic doesn't really work. To fight this, I've made a player aid that lists all the Missio possibilities and Virtus quantities, which has helped improved its accessability. It just doesn't compete with my preferred fillers.

IMHO the designers were either too confident, too eager, or possibly just lazy with this one. This game has a few interesting elements, but IMHO it was rushed to release, under-developed, and under-tested (sadly typical of Kickstarter).

First, the interesting parts: It is playable as a game, which is never a guarantee. It is possible to learn the cards and start to recognize patterns in what other players are doing (though mainly because of the sameness of those patterns for all players), so you might have some control over what's happening (though usually not by your turn). The idea of a street with locations on each side is interesting, though it is completely underused--they might as well just be zones on the table.

As for the design, it's a bit incoherent how some factions have affiliated locations and some don't, and just to say it again, there is zero theme here. Each of the mission cards is of the form "Gain the confidence of some person by arranging cards on locations". The "person" is irrelevant and is just VPs, and the arrangement of cards on a location is arbitrary and not thematic. It's a big missed opportunity, and there is no way the player can reason about the game from the theme at all, so instead, expect to just memorize some abstract rules.

As for the development, it has the same hallmark that a lot of poorly tested/underdeveloped games do, which is that the game doesn't play very well the first time through. The designers clearly spent lots of time playing with the same people who learned the ins and outs of the game not because it was fun necessarily, but rather because it was a favor/job. I simply doubt the game had many blind playtests. If it did, it would've clearly revealed the problems with the rules, and the experience for new players would have been more than an afterthought. 

It's a classic blunder for any creative endeavor to assume that you have the audience's attention for the time it takes to appreciate what you consider the finer points of your creation. This is exactly the case here.

As for the gameplay itself, it is very random for 4 players. I'd be willing to re-rate after a 2-player or 4-player team game, which I suspect are probably better and why I give this a 6. However, there are some other nits that would be less of a problem if the game itself stood better on its own merits:

* The rules don't contain clarifications of the cards (those are on a set of extra cards that are easily overlooked, and they include key information that is required to play correctly).

* The execution of the art is probably the best thing about the game, but suspiciously the character portraits don't match their titles very well. Apparently the artist was Jacqui Davis (Euphoria, Viticulture) but I wonder if the original commission was done before the design of the game was finalized. The quality also varies greatly between the illustrations of the characters and that of the city/street, which seems to have been done with something closer to MS Paint. Someone was probably trying their best, but it just doesn't work. There are also strange incongruities like the orientation of some elements of the card backs being upside down compared to the text. It's all a bit slapdash.

* The text on the cards is very small, and mainly consist of variations of "move some cards from this location to another location". They are all but impossible to read once they're down on the table, much less turned upside down on the other side of the street. More coding might've helped.

Ultimately, I believe this game could be developed further into something interesting, especially if the theme were utilized more (or at all), and it wasn't horrible to play. My review above is more a reflection of my disappointment at the crippling level of underdevelopment and lack of playtesting. A regrettable purchase in the current state.

I enjoyed Fidelitas.  The whole influence thing reminds me a little bit of Philips other game called Revolution.  This feels a bit like Revolution: The Card Game.  

I docked it a few points for the card quality.  I'm sorry, but I guess I expected better card quality than this.  The cards tend to curl and the ink comes off the edges all too easily with a few plays or shuffles.  I see several of my cards have a slightly nicked look and I'm worried about the long term quality.

I'd sleeve the game, but then the box doesn't fit sleeved cards.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

The rules were not as clear as I would prefer with regard to a couple of the cards. While the game recommends teams with 4 players, I'm not sure why as there is very little partnership aspects to the game since you can't really do much to advertise to your partner what you want. The rules say you can talk vaguely about colors and locations but you cannot share your objectives - hard to do one without the other. We played a few rules wrong in our first play so I'm open to trying again in the future but I don't see my perspective changing all that much.

RATING: 5
Fidelitas has nice artwork and is an interesting puzzle to achieve your objective cards by moving around citizens (cards) between the various town buildings. Like many card games, luck of the draw is a big factor here though when you have such a small hand of cards. Game fell flat with my group though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I picked this up at Geekway to the West because I like buying from indie publishers at these shows and because I liked the art. This is definitely a game that takes a couple plays, but we only played once.

It's not super complicated, but if you don't really know what the different actions are and, more importantly, what missions are out there, there's not a whole lot of game involved. You just do whatever helps you and hope for the best. Since we didn't know these things, that's what happened. 

However, once you see how it works and have an idea what people might be going for, I imagine things get more interesting as you can work to help yourself AND screw up other people. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Very solid and addictive game. I was not convinced originally as I thought it looked too chaotic but once you know the missio cards a bit you can start thwarting your opponents plans.

I played this game with the actual designer in a Dice Tower convention and it was quite fun for four players, so I immediately kickstarted it when it popped up.

Unfortunately, it is very chaotic and random when it's only a two player affair.  So much so, that I wanted to trade it right away, but my girlfriend asked me to reserve it for a four player affair.  Let's see how that goes.

---- Preliminary thoughts ---

Nice card management filler with hidden objectives. You play cards with abilities in areas, and with those cards and those abilities you manipulate the cards in the areas to try to fulfill your objectives and deny your opponents.

Many objectives are similar and seem easy to see through (you can't play 4-6 cards in the same area without being noticed), I guess games can drag a bit and become somewhat frustrating if people chooses to deny them to rivals. I guess this is the reason why exhausting the deck twice is an ending condition.

I think the game will be very chaotic with more than 2 players, and players will have too little control for my liking.

The art really caught my eye.

Having as many games as I have, I don't think this one will see much playing time.

The Kickstarter price is nice for USA, but way too expensive for Europe (+50% + customs).

It has a little bit of a Guildhall feel to it (which is a game I love) not only because of the theme but also due to manipulating the cards and moving them around.

The basic premise of the game is you are trying to coordinate a revolution against the king, and you do so by gathering people of various guilds in the specific locations to earn some form of generic VP, and first to a player-count-specific VP score wins. 

At the start of the game you have two 'Missio' cards, which are essentially scoring conditions, and two 'Virtus' cards, which you have to play to the corresponding guild buildings (or wherever you want if it doesn't match any), or you can place them at the tavern to add some cards to the table and to replace one of your unfulfilled Missio cards. If after playing and resolving a Virtus card you meet the conditions of a Missio, you immediately place it face down in front of you and it scores those points, and you draw a new one.

Overall the game is pretty simple in terms of basic components, but has some wonderful depth and complexity. Honestly a great game and I would not mind playing it again. A perfect blend of low shelf impact and high gaming complexity in something that takes only a half hour.

RATING: 5
Unless every player is intimately knowledgable about all the Missio cards, it is nearly impossible to purposefully prevent players from scoring. Cards will chaotically bounce around the locations until someone triggers the end game. Also, the rulebook is a train-wreck of poor terminology. Instead of using clear phrasing like a player "may/must" do an action, the rulebook suggests you "should" do it. Is that mandatory? No one knows! Also, as far as I can tell it is totally up to the players to determine what "gather" means, even though it is clearly an integral strategy to many many cards. The rules governing the Tavern location are needlessly complicated. Even re-drawing cards at the end of your turn isn't totally clear. This is just a mess.

This game has been seeing a lot of table time with my friends. Highly engaging, strategic and entertaining for what it is - a small short game you can take to and play at a bar. 

We do, however, house-rule that you can only score one card on your turn. Otherwise the game can be too swingy, as a player can essentially score more than half the points needed to end the game in a single play - and then automatically get new scoring cards, so there's no catch-up to do.

19-02-2015. Uprated after 4 plays. I did like Fidelitas with 3, but I felt that it was a little too chaotic. With two, Fidelitas morphs into a fun, light tactical card game. I liked it more, as I suspected, so I changed my rating from a 7 to a 7.5.

15-02-2015. Rated after 1 play with 3. Fidelitas came out on Kickstarter and I backed it because I liked the artwork (Belle of the Ball artwork..) and Rahdo gave a favourable opinion and the gameplay looked interesting.

In Fidelitas, you play characters on locations. Each character has a special ability that allows you to move cards around, draw cards etc. After you have played a card, you can score 'missions' , goals you have to fulfill such as having 4 differnt types of cards at a single location.

The theme is quite pasted, but I liked the game with 3. I did feel the game was maybe a little more chaotic than it would have been with 2, so I'd like to try it at that number.

A quick little game, beautiful art.  It's a pretty nice filler, but nothing amazing.  Play it and don't take it too seriously.

Picked this up at Origins after checking out some Best Treehouse Ever tiles.

Had a very fun first game last night. Thought I had the win tied up, but alas. I had 12 points and my girlfriend only 9. The highest Missio card we had seen was for 3 VPs. On her last turn she couldn't complete a Missio card with her play. I let her retry and she went to the Tavern to grab a new Missio card. It was worth 4 points for all 9 guilds to be in the city and she completed it and won 13-12. It was the only card in the deck that could have given her the win. The other 4 VP soldier Missio card wouldn't have been complete. Quite an epic ending that I doubt the end drama of will be repeated anytime soon.

Definitely a beautiful game and a lot of fun. I wasn't very good at figuring out what she was doing, but she was definitely messing with my Missio plans during most of the game.

Looks very different, but feels familiar. Cartoony stylistic artwork imbues just enough setting. Play is pretty straight-forward. The guilds act like suits, the objectives remind players of Rummy-style set collecting and the “play a card, draw a card” action strikes one as very much like traditional card game classics. Fast, easy-to-teach, and well-paced – a nice choice for new gamers, casual players and those reaching for a quick filler.  However, variable powers and card interactions offer a little depth for serious players, too.

Good game. Good with 2 & 4 players. four players wasn't as good as a two player game.

RATING: 6.5
One game ended when deck ran out 2nd time. Another game ended with only 7 cards in the deck. There may not be enough cards for a meaningful game if the Student and Professor are used enough. Scoring seems to be either lucky or too much work.

Sold at Conquest 2016.

This is my wife's favorite quick play game.  I must admit, I like it too.  I wish it were a little more predictable, but still it's good.  It travels extremely well and doesn't require a large amount of space (relatively speaking).

Really hope the rules see more revisions. The art is beautiful. The cover is basically what you get in terms of style across all the cards, though the Disney-like characters (with a wonderful comic book/stained glass look about them)  have no backgrounds on the cards.

The gameplay is great, with players deploying a diverse cast of townfolk to each of the many locations, building interesting combos and preventing or mitigating the enemy's moves. Unfortunately the rulebook and cards seem a bit rushed. (this was a Kickstarter and I get the impression Green Couch felt the pressure to deliver early rather than delivering impeccably edited product, which is regrettably all too common - and understandable - in Kickstarter projects)

Fidelitas is a great Euro-y filler that involves manipulating cards to specific locations to complete hidden player objectives and earn points.  I love that it is thinky, but still plays quick. It's easy to learn, hard to master and the artwork is gorgeous!

Don't expect a deep strategic game here. It's tactical, it's light and it's fun to play. And gorgeous artwork too

RATING: 7
Neat little thinky 'trick taking' hand management game that rewards forward planning but also requires a little dynamic thought as the board and your objectives constantly change.

Only suggestion for end point (all of which seems a little vaguely up to the players anyway) would be "if the Missio deck runs out, the other player gets to take their turn and completed Missio objective cards are totalled MINUS any still left in the players' hands"

A light filler card game that is fun if unremarkable. I'd rate it higher but the cards are flimsy.

(Feb 2015 After 2 2p games) - Play a card to 1 of 10 locations, resolve the text action, see if you score one of your Missio cards, refill hand.    

Simple sounding card game - which I enjoy.   Did not play with Manfu expansion cards, but will add them next time.

2-4 citizens competing for the most influence of the corrupt crown using a deck of cards. Place five Fidelitas city location cards in the central tableau. It is a race to place guild members of differing rarity at the various locations to meet the conditions of your hidden objectives using hand management.  Play a card, draw a card, and complete objectives. Change a mission by sending a guild member to the tavern where they don't use their influence ability and they bring a friend. The trick and strategy is managing and recovering from the abilities of the guild member cards when they are played.

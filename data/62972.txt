Exactly how hard does this ave to be. Getting past the first Wintere without being pushed back to the border is tough enough. An expanded solitaire system from the States of Siege series, with a much more 'wargame' feel due to the many and varied strategic and tactical decisons to make. Rulebook needs some work though.

Great solitaire game from Victory Point. Fast to set up. The feeling of helplessness from 44 onwards is brilliantly conveyed as the Russian steamroller squashes the defeneders of the Reich. 

Downgraded due to crappy components which are really showing wear and tear. I havent played it that much.

RATING: 7
Good, if a bit harsh. Some of the mechanics are very neat, especially the chit drawing for combat resolution and the way the front line is maintained.

I can't help thinking I would find it more fun playing the Russians - at least the game would end on an upswing rather than defeat.

One of the more interesting solitaire games I have come across.  It didn't feel like I was managing AI as much as I was doing my own thing.  I like the chrome and the freshness of the game.  Filling in the holes in the line was a strange mechanic.  I do like the diceless combat system and the blitz vs. standard combat tables and the economic system. Having small scenarios is a big bonus, also.

Having just received this (March 2012), my initial impressions are skewed to the dark side because of the quality--a misnomer for sure--of the components.  Seriously, I could rant a stream of colourful metaphors.  And the map: could even more have been jammed into such a small space?  If VPG is trying to set a new pattern compared to the "big boys" of wargames, I guess one could say that it is achieving its objective.  More to come.

RATING: 8
Though some of the rules are fiddly, this remains a very well done solitaire system. 

Like all cardboard solitaire games, the AI is rather simple, but in this case the Soviet actions are usually quite deliberate (as opposed to random), making for one nasty "opponent".

RATING: 7
Good game. I'm just starting to delve into solo wargames. Really enjoy this solo gem. Its a wargame that doesn't feel the same.  There's enough variability to keep it interesting.  The chit-pull system is a neat system that changes throughout the game.  This is a struggle.  It does take a while, and the component quality is low.  A nice reproduction with great components would send this game through the roof. Highly recommended for solo wargamers.

On the way!  12/2010.

This is a great simple game (without being simplistic) on the Eastern Front.  Game play is smooth and easy and the grand strategy of the war has an impact on play.  You are commanding the Germans, but must also deal with economic issues as well as the inevitable "friction" through random events.  Great fun each time I've played and it should appeal to anyone who has ever tried to drive "ever deeper East" and wants a game that is easy to set up and has good strategic choices. :thumbsup:

RATING: 7
This is a pretty compelling strategic level solo account of the Eastern Front. I've soloed the older Russian Front title, and while that has more tactics and war-game satisfaction, I do prefer that this actually plays solo against an A.I. That said, it follows the suit of many VPG titles in that, without significant randomization factors, it would play out very similarly and you'd have little chance of victory (as if you have any already).

As I see it, the Axis needs to win via Automatic Conquest. I have come fairly close, but Stalingrad is the kicker. Perhaps a VP victory is possible if you have a very good early game and are conservative during the winters of '41 and '42. At any rate, the game is "realistic" in that it is very hard for the Axis to win.

What I like about the game are the mechanisms, and the sense of grand sweep. The chit pull system works well, and the event cards are nicely varied. For a VPG title, it is meaty and multifaceted. What I dislike, though, is the end game. At a certain point, there is just no possibility, unless you win by mid '43, that the initiative is not going to pile up against the Axis. At that point, it simply feels like grinding out a foregone conclusion. It gets worse once you are in full-on collapse, as the game basically becomes a chit-pull fest, with very mathy calculations as to the order of battles, for no pay off; since once in collapse, the Axis has no combat phases, I can't see how you can ever pull yourself out. So you are left with turns with no decisions, and simply sitting there, doing math, pulling chits, etc etc. While I won't knock this for simulation value, it is boring as shit to play through, and gives you a nice taste of how demoralizing the Eastern Front was. I've called all my games when it became obvious that collapse was a death spiral, but I don't like doing so. I'm not sure how you'd resolve this and stay true to the subject matter, but it does deaden the resolve to play again anytime soon. Still and all, this is my favorite strategic level VPG title at this point.

A friend brought this to game night ... I was intrigued but not enough to borrow it.  The Russian frontier 8 hexes wide?  What's with the trend to reduce the scope, the scale of the Eastern Front into less and less space?

The East Front *is about space* ... endless expanses and great distances.

I like maneuvering in that vast space too much for a game like this to appeal.

And let's face it, there are plenty of classics and new titles for me to enjoy the East Front already.

The poor quality components and solo only nature didn't do anything to impress me either.

Initial impression after two thirds of a campaign game played. So far I like the game a lot - the various ways that Soviet superiority develops are very clever and well designed. My only concern (and why I'm giving it a seven) is that I have concerns that the endgame can turn into a big AI admin session with few if any good decisions for the Germans. That said, the early game is very exciting for the Germans and you still have really interesting decisions to make that seem to reflect real world issues (albeit on a high scale). Tentatively recommended.

Excellent solitaire treatment of the Eastern Front. Well written rulebook, interesting decisions to make and good replay-ability.

The Soviet Counterattack phase can get a little fiddly/convoluted and there is a little fiddly detail around returning units to either the reserve or holding boxes, which has me scurrying back to the rule-book. apart from that a really good game and better than i expected.

As normal for VPG the component quality does not justify the price - but the gameplay does.

RATING: 8
Seeing that the Russian Front is comprised by so few hexes on the map and this game concers only one player I was doubtful of its value as a wargame. By viewing so many positive comments in the BGG site and after downloading the rules I thought I should give it a try. It ended up being a small gem for solitaire play. I played the whole campaign on my first try. The map has all the aid tables that you need for the play. The mechanics are innovative taking in consideration that you play the entire Russian Campaign in solo mode. Counters have standard NATO symbols. Various markers help you on keeping count of various events and special cases. Although the front line moves as the waves on the sea. the end result is realistic and approaches historical facts. The combat procedures use no dice and results are implemented by drawing random chits. High replayability due to this mode.Though, the blitzkrieg effect is applied in full and results highly simulate the tacics of that time. You get thrilling moments by capturing major cities and trying to keep them conquered. The game ends for you (as the Axis player) by capturing Leningrad, Moscow and Stalingrad. Anything else is a lost cause. All play is based on who has the initiative and how many victory points have been accumulated. Apart from the Campaign, 5 more scenarios comprise the rule book. Make sure to download the FAQ found in the BGG site which is most helpful sorting out details and ambiguities. The only flaw that one can find is with the rule-book which misses an index of where to find what when looking up for a detail. Too tiresome looking page after page to seek a small paragraph regarding how reinforcements arrive, battle procedures and mechanics of play. Also at some points things become too abstract and relative for such a huge battlefield – historical reality is sacrificed for the cause of play. The game is worth your time and merits to end up in your wargaming collection.

Solitaire wargame about the full Russian campaign (1941-45). The map and units recall classic hex & counters wargames, but the diceless system (using colored chits) is quite innovative. The full campaign is a bit long to play, but there are several shorter scenarios. I have only played the campaign, and always lost. I think that this is a difficult game to win, but I do not see it as something negative, but as a challenge!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a very engrossing solo game.  The combat system is pretty fun, and having both the blitz and regular combat phases are great.  The different unit types are also cool, and it is scary to see those wimpy Russian units get replaced with better ones as the campaign goes on.  Terrain plays a very small role in combat which is unfortunate - there is no benefit to defending in rough terrain.
My biggest gripe about this game is how the events (particularly economic chit draws) can completely overwhelm the action on the map.  As a wargame player I want to win or lose on the map, not the econ cup.  When initiative events go against you they can be huge, and there is nothing you can do to mitigate against them.  If the events are for you, then you win.  The result of the battles on the map sometimes feels secondary.

RATING: 7
Interesting game concept. The rules are clear. The components quality is, as usual with VPG, less than optimal. The scenarios with only Soviet Initiative are more for the masochist ones. Rules: 3 (1-3); Components: 2 (1-3); Fun/Replayability: 2 (1-3); Solitaire: 0 (0-1).

RATING: 8
Wow! This is a fun game! Haven't played a full game yet. I keep finding out that I'm forgetting rules, or misinterpreting them. So I've always had to stop part way through.

My rating will likely increase once I finally manage to correctly play a whole game.

I especially appreciate the different scenarios allowing you to start at various stages of the war. This means you can tune the length of play to your available time. Nice!

There's a lot of chaos here, and much that is out of the player's control, but that's really necessary in a solitaire game. Otherwise, TBC would be little more than a puzzle, to be set up on the shelf once it was "solved".

This is a real winner here, with lots of innovations:

- Combat resolution is via chit pull, the color of which determines outcome. Some chits have "X" on them and are removed, making the combat cup more hostile to the Axis player over time. This is a brilliant design concept.

- The front line is always continuous and lined with opposing units. This makes breakthroughs and surrounding battles quite fraught with peril. Very exciting!

- Strategic level concerns are simply and effortlessly modeled with Economic chit draws. This nicely illustrates the effects of the wider war.

- The Event cards add quite a bit of story-telling narrative to game play, making each game not only unique, but also compelling.

I'm very impressed with Gary Graber's design. I hope another publisher publishes this fantastic design.

See, VPG has an "all games sold as is" policy which means I'm stuck with the poor quality components in my copy of this game. I won't go into the details here, except to say that I was forced to print out and make my own replacement components.

I'm rather disappointed that VPG does not make their "all games sold as is" policy clear [i]before[/i] you buy their products.

Will I ever purchase another VPG game?

No.

A solo-game so it comes with all the baggage that entails: performing our own AI, success hinges more upon luck than good play, etc.

There are some things that I quite like in here. The visualization of the "front line" is very nice. The enemy AI is pretty decent -- it's not pure randomness -- though it can be a bit laborious to count factors repeatedly.

The fun part of the game is the initial push towards Stalingrad, etc. Once the tide begins to turn against the Germans the fun dissipates. When you get into full Axis Collapse you're just going through the motions.

Comes with some "scenarios" but I doubt many people bother with them: the fun part is the first few turns.

An excellent solitaire wargame.  Love the chit-pulling.  My only complaint is that the constant rebuilding of the Soviet line is somewhat tedious; the tiny counters and hexes doesn't help the problem.  I think I'll blow the map up to solve that problem, because I do quite like this game.

This solo game of the entire conflict on the European eastern front 1941-45 draws you in with a promise of easy conquest, but will eventually squeeze the life out of your forces. Innovative chit draw mechanism. Innovative diceless combat. This game has it all. My best from Victory Point Games so far.

At last i played it after almost 2 years! This game is an amazing solo experience for wargamers regarding the WW2 eastern front ! The designers had done an amazing masterpiece because with a handful of components, a small deck and the fantastic diceless chit draw mechanism from the cup of doom the gaming experience is very thematic, deeply tactical and while playing this phenomenal game you feel like a general in his operation room mustering his forces...
It deserves a VPG deluxe edition like Nemo and Zeds...

The game is quite long and set up also takes quite a bit, but it's ok - I like long games :) The only problem is, I have quite a few of them, and I can see myself not returning to this one that often given how much I love games like Fields of Fire, D-Day at Omaha Beach or, on a slightly different note, Mage Knight.

For me it was quite difficult to follow all rules at the beginning and many times I discovered forgetting something. Now that I played three times the "Fall Blau" have some grasp of this very interesting game. The German must be very clever and lucky and push, push, push. When the Soviets attack with an Initiative of -2 (and downwards) they make terrible damages and you never know how deep they can suddendly penetrate your defensive lines.
In my 3rd play, I totally changed the history, because I was really lucky: the Finns attacked Leningrad (I got the event card "Finns expand war") and I got a free advance of one panzer (card event "Wehrmacht push")both at the beinning of Summer turn. So I attacked Leningrand with two german infantries and one Finnish and I conquered this capital city during autumn 1942. In fact I draw totally three green chits (wich allow to advance even in a major city like Leningrad) out of six. Moscow falled during summer 1943 (using a Panzer, 1 motorized units and 2 infantries) and Stalingrad in autumn 1943 (with two attacks of a Panzer, one per turn). The soviets counterattacked but they only succeeded to encircle Stalingrad during autumn 1943, not enough to avoid the german victory. As you see, you need to be very lucky to win. Very nice game! I like a lot the short scenarios: you have not to invest a lot of time and can easily have 1 hour fun!

Tricky to play because there is not another set of eyes to catch rules errors, and the rules are relatively complex for a solitaire game.  This is a rich gaming experience: more meat, complexity, and time required than States of Siege, for example.

An interesting challenge for a long-time solo gamer is NOT to try one's best for the Soviets when a decision needs to be made: the game was built for the Axis player to make the decisions that are in HIS best interest, so it is actually wrong and foolish to play the Soviets "smart" when a choice needs to be made.  Great fun and quite a challenge.

The Barbarossa Campaign is a very good solitaire game. You have plenty of decisions to make, the system takes the strain to help you enjoy the experience, feel the tension of the shifting initiative, and manage the strategic picture with key focus beyond the Front line. Withinn 2-3 turns you will find yourself becoming comfortable as the games engine starts to purr along. The AI is strong and pushes you, stretches you and slaps you (but in a good way).  I wouldn’t call it elegant as there is a fair bit to go through but it works very well.

A very nice design with just enough strategic meat and mechanics that work nicely together. What seemed a bit daunting at first, turned out to be a hidden gem. And its darn good fun!

Attention Alan and Co. at Victory Point Games! This game should be a great opportunity for an  IOS game. I would really welcome the opportunity to try an IOS version.

Now with nice, thick, laser-cut counters. Map and Aids are also on an improved stock. Sort of a mini-deluxe edition[/b]


An exciting solitaire game from Victory Point Games that is meatier and more complex than their State of Siege titles.

It's fun to play the Germans blitzing into Russia in '41 & '42 when all focus is on toppling as many cities as possible and keeping the shell-shocked Russians back-pedaling, sometime around'43, however, they finally get their gloves laced up and start swinging back HARD. Hidden in this game is a surprisingly, intelligent and vengeful AI.

There are a lot of abstractions here, keeping you firmly focused on the matter of the front-line, pushing forward or holding on. Momentum is everything.

Yes, there's a heavy amount of luck, a few good card draws or chit-pulls can make an enormous difference, but at the same time this never feels like a puzzle just waiting to be cracked. As with history the struggle feels too great, near impossible, but you are trying anyway, so a bit of good luck should go a long way.

The map is busy and the rules are a little heavier than you'd expect from VPG, with a lot of important details to keep track of, (the difference between remove and eliminate, the way the combat chit symbols interact differently with each of the combat tables, how the different troop types recycle on and off the map) so keep the rulebook close but once you get it, things will start rolling along pretty smooth.

Overall a very impressive solitaire design that throws you right into the heart of an absolutely horrific time and place, and asks if you can do better.

If this were to be given VPG's Gold Banner treatment it would be an insta-buy for me.

Le jeu donne une bonne impression du cours de la guerre. Au début, l'Axe est vraiment fort. Les Blitz lui permettent d'avancer très vite et très loin. Les unités soviétiques sont faibles et insignifiantes. Les hivers 41 et 42 font vraiment mal.
Puis au fur et à mesure, les soviétiques s'installent, l'économie soviétique prend le dessus. Et finalement, l'Axe perd l'initiative, les Soviétiques reprennent du terrain et les percées des chars T34 sont dévastatrices.

Les jeu est excellent en lui-même. Le principe des jetons que l'on tire pour résoudre les combats est fantastique : cela permet de ne pas lancer des brouettes de dés et cela compense la chance. Et surtout, on enlève des jetons au fur et à mesure, des jetons favorables à l'Axe. Du coup cela devient de plus en plus compliqué pour l'Axe.
Les aides de jeux sont très bien conçues.

Quite well done solitaire wargame! Medium complexity with surprisingly few rules holes for such a game. The game really creates a dramatic feel, with the Germans starting out strong and making progress, then gradually bogging down as the USSR forces build up and push them back. I have won handily, lost ignominously, and finished in between. Good replay value for a long (several hours) solitaire game!

RATING: 7
So, after 4 plays I'm still not sure what I think about this game:

- The game has a strong "push your luck" feeling during the blitz phases, which doesn't feel completely right in a wargame (for me): technically, you could be around Moscow at the end of turn 1's blitz phase and even take it during the ensuing combat phase (odds are _extremely_ against you on this, but it's possible). Pushing your luck is not without fun, but it's not necessarily the kind of decision I want to take in a 3-4h game [it's ok for the SoS games though].

- The game is designed to be hard, but, not unlike the SoS games, this "hard" part seems to vastly depend on the odds of the cards/draws being stacked against you, not on a challenging IA [although, the soviet counter-attacks are something terrible, so a SoS comparison is not entirely fair]

- Which brings me to the luck factor: it is huge. Two things may determine directly if you will win the game fast or be on a losing path in a couple of turns: the economic draw (specially lend lease, which I strongly suggest to "un-random" with some variant) and the City-conquest draw -> if you manage to get 3/4 city conquest boni, you _know_ you'll be able to win the game unless a disaster happen (or some event gives you negative shifts). Both of these things are completely out of your control, which gives me a somewhat mixed after-taste.

In the end, I know I won not because I'm a military genius (which I'm not ), but because I happened to draw 4 city boni, 1 defense marker, a couple of cool reinforcements and no really bad economic counter.

Despite all of this, I did enjoy the game and might give it another couple of tries, but the real problem remains that it might just have too much luck to justify a 3-4h game (in case you play to the bitter end).

In a word, brilliant.  I can see the randomness of certain mechanisms but you just have to learn to play around them.  The game is a challenge, no question.

Excellent, deep strategic solitaire play. Immersive, Eastern Front theme you can really sink your teeth into.
Only real critique: As the game progresses and the front line becomes longer with bulges and salients, Soviet counterattack phase can feel like a long counting excersize. As a result, the game felt bogged down at times.
Still, a great game for a long, lazy weekend :)

Nice solitaire approach. It's one of my favorite VP Games.

Great game for simulating barbarossa in solo mode. But the production quality is poor.

Love this game. It feels both epic and manageable at the same time, which is no small achievement. I love how the designers packed so much information into the map and player aids, which flattens the learning curve dramatically. Even after things turn against you and victory no longer appears achievable, it's still interesting to see if you can avoid decisive defeat (most likely you can't). If I have any real criticism, it's on the Axis strategic mode, which applies too infrequently--not because it's unfair, but because it makes this aspect of the game far less interesting.

Wow. This is a really good solitaire wargame.  It deserves a deluxe treatment.

Muy buen juego....lo unico que no me convence son las numerosas excepciones a lo que serían las reglas estandar. Tienes que ir controlando esas excepciones en cada turno

Had this game on my table only once so my rating might not be fair. Somehow I did not enjoy it as much as I thought I would. I love wargames, and especially solitaire ones, but this one just didn't click.

I like the thorough representation of the war. The interactive relationship between the combat units on the map and the economic/initiative/strategic/situational factors is made very clear. Other games represent this, of course, but here it's shown so nicely on the various displays.

This game does exactly what it should do, tell a fairly fast moving and compelling story that unravels during play. It´s played on an operational level and the overall strategy decisions are only minor.

The flow of the game is nicely done. The armour formations need room to manouver, and are hampered if you concentrate them to much. If a defensive line ruptures it can turn into a rout, but an overextended USSR can be counterattacked and bag you some nice VP:s. 
Rules are nicely laid out and well written. Only gripe is that the plying pieces are a bit on the cheap side, but the gameplay makes up for that. "Just one more turn, I know I can make it." 

Good service from the publisher, when I told them about a misprint they immediately sent a replacement.

Learning the system - totally engrossing for me - tentative rating of 8 but confident. Downgraded slightly but still a blast to play. Victory has been illusive but I enjoy a loss as well. Disappointed that his will not get and upgrade now that the company is moving and switching production models.

Simpler than what rules would imply.  Lots of unique mechanics for maintaining front line, managing resources, and resolving combat without dice.  Interesting tense, solitaire game that plays very well.

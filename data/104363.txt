Ugh.. So FFG goes ahead and ruins Dune? They just never manage to produce anything even remotely original, do they? Awaiting more info with dread.. 

For me, the greatest thing about the original Dune is the theme - being based on one of the greatest works of literary fiction - and the gameplay supported the theme. The TI "universe" is incredibly lame and ridiculous rip-off of popular SciFi ideas and doesn't interest me at all.

El mapa "estilo diagrama" le resta sensación temática al juego, y por el contrario, la flota solar (o como se diga) resulta sobreproducida y esos armatostes no aportan nada al juego (ni restan).

Respecto al juego en sí, no me causó ninguna impresión, ni mala, ni buena. Podré vivir sin él...

While I have never had a chance to play Dune and thus cannot compare the two games I thoroughly enjoy this re-imagining. making alliances is recommended and breaking them is definatly encouraged, the opportunity for betrayal really makes me smile regardless of whether I'm the betrayer or betrayee. I like games that promote social interaction and I love games that reward me for being cruel to my friends thus this is up there with my favourites x
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Double crossing, backstabbing, alliances, shadow moves - this game has some very cool social interactions. I like to think of it as a cross between Cosmic Encounter and Twilight Imperium (I know that's really not a great description). The varied victory conditions and political shenanigans make it way more than an area control and combat game. If you love surprises in your gameplay and hidden objectives, you'll love Rex.

RATING: 8
I loved my one play of this - the different races are SO asymmetric but nicely balanced in their absurd powers. The combat system is superb and there were so many intense moments. I won in an alliance and threw my hands up in success until my ally revealed he'd picked me as the winner on that turn, and snatched my victory away from me. I'd fallen into a trap he'd been working on since before the game and it was glorious. The only thing that would improve it is a reversion to the Dune theme, which I would absolutely prefer.

RATING: 7.75
I have mixed feelings about Rex. I like the mix: fast-pace and light-weight wargame like Kemet, fluid alliances and negotiation similar to Twilight Imperium, and interesting endgame traitor mechanics.

Rex is based on the very old board game Dune, which is way the gameplay feels oldschool: you bid in player order over unknown action cards (which I do not like), you move and deploy units in player order, you fight battles in player order. The game feels very mechanically. 
On the other hand, the dependence on the player order creates a lot of interesting strategies to think about, e. g., you cannnot counter-act after your movement-turn is over.

The game requires everyone to pay attention and also to memorize who have what action cards.
The artwork and components are good, however, the game board should have highlighted the different sectors more clearly. 
The game supports different player counts, but you should play it with at least 5 people, otherwise the game of alliances is less interesting.
The best part of Rex are the different factions and their powers combined with shifting alliances.

All in all, I wish this game would get a reimplemtation with replaced bidding over random cards, replace the "binary" action cards (each card has a counter card), better support for small player counts, and support for battles with more than 2 factions.

Player: 3-6 (best: 5-6)
Time: 120m

RATING: 8
A game with solid mechanics and a good theme. The way victory can be achieved is myriad and even with a alliance you can snatch victory for yourself at your own risk if your ally or foe has a specific win condition on a card or otherwise. Also, not being able to make or break an alliance till a ceasefire card is played also adds a new dimension of risk and reward to the game with all the abilities and extra win conditions that are unique to the various races. A more structured alliance system rather than a open one in most other games, unique indeed. 
Downside is the art makes the board look like a Galaxy than the one world we are fighting on, as I found out later. And this game def. favors people who know the game cards more and does shine better with a larger compliment of players as then more of the extra win conditions and powers come into play and do balance each other to a certain extent.

 Game of the Month for February.

From the same designer as Cosmic Encounter, this game was a lot of fun. I look forward to playing it again, it may end up a 9. From setup to breakdown it took 3 hours with learning and everyone being new, so I could see 3 hours or less for a full 6.

Lots of asymmetrical race powers, treachery, big reveal moments and orbiting bombardments. I do want to someday play Dune, because I think that IP fits a little better with the mechanics here, but the game is great fun as is, and honestly the length of original dune scares me off.

The one mark against this is that it really seems like it would be best with 6.

The remake of DUNE, but the flavor do not grow on me. Including battle of Baghdad, this is probably the least favorable in thematic sense.

The game play is very similar to the other 2 games and the components are top notch.

With 6 players, it's a pretty tense game, but every player MUST do their factions utmost to be enjoyable. Any player turtling or playing out of the norm would cause the game to be frustrating. 

It's also questionable if some factions are allowed to be allied to each other.

Overall enjoyable but not sucked into the theme like DUNE did.

I can see why the original game had a following. However, that was a good... thirty years ago?

Long game, mid-to-long wait between turns, and overall, just not that appealing to me. The plastic ships are really nice. I often wonder if FFG couldn't make money selling just the bits to their games...

Despite all the changes, including a complete theme transplant, Rex feels remarkably faithful to Dune.  I like most of the changes, particularly the shortening of the game and making it harder for a triple alliance to win.  I found that in Dune a triple alliance became the "we're bored with this now" game finisher. 

Other changes are less welcome.  I dislike default win if nobody else does victory conditions.  Rex makes matters worse by allowing one faction to win by predicting this default win.  The set-up makes a sucker punch first turn win possible.  It's been a while, but I don't remember that possibility in Dune.

Combat resolution is handled just the same as in Dune, which is to say simply, with strategy cards and traitors throwing in unpredictable elements. That certainly produces dramatic reversals of fortune, but ultimately, it seems to me that both Dune and Rex are prone to eventful stalemate.

I found the artwork just OK, though entirely functional.  There is surprisingly little plastic in this FFG box, with the exception of the massively over-produced bomber squadron.  Cards and chits are all good quality, though the first player marker is easily mistaken for a coaster.

Our first game was decided by a series of devastating mistakes... I think that after a couple of plays this game will reveal itself a little clearer. Certain partnerships seem by definition more powerful so I'm not 100% certain how others are supposed to react.

A player either likes this game or not. I don't like it that much because some fractions can be really weak while others form strong alliances. It often happens that a player simply can't do much on the board and literally sits out most of the game.On top of that, most of the games ends very similary - end in 8th round and the ninja turtles wins by guessing Hacan.

Played at friend's house with six players, it was fun but found little use for most of the board. We got the allies card right away, squared off into two 3-player alliances and for the most part just fought over the victory locations with as many units as possible. While fun, it felt like this was a very limited experience especially given how long it can take to play a single game. I'd like to play again as I think this might have been an outlier experience.

Received in a math trade. Second time I've owned this game. Bought new back in 2013 and then traded away since we never had six people at boardgame night. Now we regularly have six (or more!) and I also know of the rules we got wrong the first time around.

(Months later): Never have six players anymore. FML.

Note to self, DO NOT BUY AGAIN.

I like the Twilight Imperium universe, which makes me want to give this game a high rating. Rex is a reimplementation of the old Dune boardgame from 1979 and while it is a good reimplementation it still feels somewhat old rulewise. And FFG could have made a better job writing the rules.

I know very little about Dune (Got 1/4 of the way through the book) and have watched the Alan Smithee cut of David Lynch's film. 
I have play Twilight Imperium loads and love the setting of grandiose space opera with ALL the tropes. 

Therefore I really got into this game. Tons of backstabbing, betrayal, politicking, positioning, land-grabbing, and laser fire. Great variable player powers which are all unique. Interesting victory conditions. 

First game I had a Xxcha prediction win! It was fantastically tense.

Second game we had 6, Backstabbing mayhem. Awesome game and we even messed up on some Influence rules..Rating confirmed 8.

Never got to the table, played friend copies. If i am gonna play something in the TI universe its gonna be TI3. Also for negotiation, AGoT. So it was redundant for two reasons.. traded.

It's nice that this game is available again and that the counters have been updated.  Wish that the board was a planet map rather than the Arkham Horror layout.  I really dislike this board.  I'd rather have the original game, but for those that don't have the original, this is a good alternate. 

Unlike most updates, I feel absolutely no need to own this edition.

I really am not very good at this game, but it's quite enjoyable. A game of military dominance like Risk, but with a decent set of rules and a bombardment from orbit mechanic that stops players from sitting in one place for too long.

Problems include it being difficult to fight back from a few bad loses, and races that start in protected spaceport areas having an obvious advantage in play. Flawed fun good for the occasional play.

I waited many years before trying one of the holy grail games of the cardboard kingdom, Dune. And I finally played Rex...

Well, I must say that the first impression, by reading the rules, was disappointment: I guess most of the charm of Dune came from the theme, and Rex in this aspect is so generic I don't really care (while I love the book and, a little less, the movie).
Many of the rules for factions don't make any sense when you strip away the Dune fluff.
And the map is quite messy and not so readable at a glance...

Gameplay, though, was surprisingly engaging. I am surprised this design has more than 30 years...
The ebb and flow of the game sucks players in a enjoyable narrative, while victory opportunities open and close (in many turns there's no real choice to be made) and everybody tries to have is shot at victory.

Not a game I would like to play anytime, and with anyone. But with the right group, in the right moment, it's a great play experience!

RATING: 6
Fantasy Flight components make this game a beauty to look at. However, I'm not familiar with the backstory so not thematically invested in the game. Alliances are essential, and there is a limitation as to when you can make and break them. Unfortunately, I feel that there are some factions who MUST make alliances with others in order to progress in the game. In this way the alliance mechanism feels particularly restrictive.

Awesome asymmetrical area control game. I love how even though the game usually takes awhile, it can end pretty quickly sometimes.

Wow! That was fun! We played a 4 player game of Rex and it goes down as 1 of my most fun experineces of all time. 2 sets of 2 players were allied with each other, and the alliance I was in won on turn 4. My "partner" thought about trying to steal the victory for himself by using his Treachery card, but went for the shared victory instead as he thought that I might have picked him as the winner with my special power.So much awesomeness packed into this box!

I'm sure the bad session had an impact on opinion: the teacher didn't know the rules and taught as we played from the rulebook. Additionally, we played with the rulebook's uneratta-ed "only pull 2 influence total from a space" instead of "pull 2 influence per troop." This could change the economic slump I felt approaching. 

All of that being said, this may be an unfair rating, but I did not enjoy the game and I feel that there's a low ceiling for my ultimate opinion. I don't think I enjoy incredibly asymmetric games, and this is a prime example. Feelings of annoyance, resignation, and frustration are not worth it for the time investment.

My favorite game, although it's not without some flaws: the downtime, some fiddliness, and can lead to some frustration due to players "excluded" from the game when the alliances are formed.

-The mechanics are quite cool. Love the blind bidding for cards, and the battle mechanics is cool.

I've only played it once, and thought it was all right but not fantastic.  (Though to be fair, I think we played it wrong -- that, or the "Tactical Retreat" card is SEVERELY broken.)  It's fast-paced and engaging, but so chaotic and swingy that it makes long-term (or even medium-term) planning damn near impossible.  And I found the mechanism for making/breaking formal alliances to be very restrictive.  I'd gladly give it another go, but I'm not going to be seeking this one out myself.

Enjoyable, and interesting mechanics.  However, the end-game seems pretty unsatisfying, as the Turn 8 Hacan win seems pretty lame.  Alliances feel potent, perhaps too potent, and then you have to resort to the Betrayal cards to see who comes out on top... or you share a joint victory, which is kind of lame too.

It's a good try by Fantasy Flight to recreate Dune after efforts failed to secure the Herbert license. I was one of those who fought for this game to be taken seriously, chalking up many of its critics as exaggerating the mechanics differences owing to their sense of purism. I was wrong. I've played Dune now and Rex is just not close enough. There are small rules changes, yes, and the board is a mess, but the difference in theme really does make so much more of a difference than I could have imagined. My dream would be Fantasy Flight somehow getting the license after all and publishing the Ilya redesign of Dune which is an absolute wonder to behold (not likely, I know). All of this said, as a poor man's Dune, I suppose it can deliver some of the goods, particularly if one has an affinity for the Twilight Imperium universe (which I don't).

RATING: 7.7
Highly enjoyable, loved the assymetric powers and goals.  ALiances really kept up player interaction. Conflict encouraged. System for resolving conflict simple and straight forward but with a meaningfull range of decisions.  Certainly not a beginner game as still quite complex, but not overly analytical. While the theme isn't as strong as the Dune ones sounds, it certainly didn't feel tacked on (such as it does in Race through the Galaxy etc). Has an epic story feel. Leaves you with a sense of completion and nicely wanting to discuss the games events afterwards. So, while very different to TI3 etc still has a strong epic feel, that for me scratches a similar itch - as does say BSG. The reversals of fortune also added nicely to the nail bitingness of game play.

On the down side, it does seem some races are easier to play than others.  The race which can look at the strategy cards seemed hard, everyone else seemed to have a way of getting money/ or doing stuff cheaply whch he didn't so mining influence was much more important to him, and if he failed to do so he was left very much in the cold with little way to come back into the game.

Overall a strong 8/10 for me.

As a big fan of Dune I had to get this game the moment I saw it. I hope I won't be disappointed having accepted there were some difficulties with the original - I love what they've done with the bits and am still exploring the rules/options to see if any of the original cracks have been sealed.

My biggest concern is the thematic translation. The best thing about Dune was the marriage of theme to mechanics which helped me past some of the "gamey" aspects. If they are still around and the theme just doesn't quite cut it I'm not sure the game will stand up as well. Only time will tell...

Hay cartas de eventos y se pueden conseguir cartas de tecnologías y mejoras. El ataque tiene un poco de faroleo. No sólo se realiza con fichas, sino que hay un marcador en el que cada uno indica cuántos soldados intervienen en el combate. Si ganas, pierdes todos esos soldados. 

Lo jugué hace algún tiempo y olvidé incluir la descripción, así que hablo de memoria. He olvidado muchas cosas, pero me dejó buena impresión. No es demasiado largo, sobre todo comparandolo con juegos del estilo. Ofrece las mismas sensaciones, pero en menos tiempo. En torno a dos horas o por ahí... (aunque las partidas pueden duran muy poco).

No es recomdable para no jugones.

A very good game - takes most of Twilight Imperium and condenses it somewhat. Which is a good thing!
Watch out for making alliances too early, and make sure you get your rules straight!

It took 3 plays but I finally found my groove in Rex. It has a good mix of bluffing, mechanics and options. The special abilities of each faction are interesting, their is a large potential for player interaction and combat can be brutal. Finding the sweet spot in combat is going to be a challenge for me. Balancing force commitment while guessing what the opponent may do is tough.

This is a finely crafted piece of engineering genius, the TI universe IMHO is much better for the game than dune. The idea of fighting in the mother of all battles is quite simply appealing and it adds to the feel of gritty tactical combat that this game is impregnated with. This is a game about hand to hand combat in the middle of an infernal city where flames fall from the sky and once great buildings crumble, where water is more precious than gold, and every man is by himself trying to win an impossible fight against the odds. The alliance sistem is quite nice, and adds a layer of elegance into a game that is already pretty ellegant thanks to its unique combat resolution sistem.

The racial advantages are really well chosen and again they make a better reflection of TI faction background than that of dune background. So yeah, this game has great mehanics melted into a much better brackground for said mechanics than the original one ever provided. Just remmenber to play the roles when you play this game, since nothing would be funnier than trying to speak like any of the great races ;D

I have a review here now, so you can read that instead. TL;DR: Rex is ok, but Hacan is too powerful. Find a fix. Otherwise, Rex is just worse than Dune in almost every way, so if you can just play Dune, with all optionals, to 10 turns instead of 15. The PnP Dune games are OK, but stick with the original graphic design if at all possible.
---
How about a real live comment after having actually played instead of all this ranting? Sure, why not.

Rex is pretty good. FFG has done the right thing and not fundamentally messed with the design, instead just transplanting it to their own backstory. Which is fine; the underlying game is strong enough that it'll be entertaining regardless. Rex is fun, maintains a lot of the strength of the original, and should be enjoyed by both fans of Dune and people who haven't played Dune. It's a highly playable and highly interactive game, but one that sensibly constrains the many problems of the genre to make a solid and well-paced experience.

And yet ... as a long-time Dune fan, it's hard not to feel that virtually every change they have made - and they are not completely trivial - ranges from questionable to bad. There are two huge wins, of course: the reduction in the raw number of turns and so playing time, and the greater movement capability to increase the pace. These were sensible changes. But everything else? The new battle resolution is significantly worse. The new victory conditions (which allow solo wins in drawn games, not uncommon with 4 players) are worse. The revised shipping costs are problematic on several levels, and slow the game down. Hacon is now probably significantly overpowered. The new leader revival rules are worse. The betrayal cards should stay in the box. The physical design is, of course, a complete nightmare that has sacrificed any idea of usability on the alter of baroque over-design. FFG's sexist staff have banished the great female characters of Dune, replacing them all with men.

For a guy who is a huge fan of Dune, all these bad choices are like staring into headlights. Yes, Rex is a good game and it is fun despite the questionable choices, because the original game was *so* good. It's hard not to be frustrated though, thinking about the game that could have been if FFG had any clue at all.
---

Ok, one last rant ... WTF with the generic leader names? FFG seems compelled to drain flavor and tension out of the game. First this silly two-step combat resolution, all either because they forgot the player screen or failed to realize their combat dials were smaller than their strategy cards, then they take a nice, flavorful element of the base game - leaders with names and stories - and rip it out in favor of blandness. Ugh.

Since it's become a pet peeve, I'll also mention that the game is littered with bad font size choices. And the presentation is generally a complete mess - noisy, non-functional, bad information communication - why do they feel they always need to sacrifice utility on the altar of over-design? In Dune, you could see which areas were vulnerable to the storm and which weren't because the visual design was a nice blend of form and function. Now you have to hunt down tiny icons in a sea of visual clutter. It's a game, people have to play it, not just look at it.

Despite all this negativity, I still am warily looking forward to trying Rex. But the guys up in Roseville really are completely clueless.

I find myself idly wondering what's going to be in the first inevitable expansion.

---

Warily looking forward to this. I like that the length has been shortened from 15 to 8 turns; in all honestly, Dune games that went the distance were a real slog, you really want this to be done by turn 8 or 10. So that change seems good. Also, formalizing the no-note-taking and no-showing-your-cards is good, I think. Note-taking was often a part of Dune in some way, but it could get silly when taken to extremes, primarily if the Atriedes insisted on tracking every Treachery card movement on paper, so I think it's on balance good to expressly disallow it. Rex does have pretty harsh anti-secrecy rules though; all discussion has to be in front of everyone, which raises the question of how you discuss battle plans, a common thing allies do in Dune. We played Dune such that you weren't allowed to leave the table, but that didn't preclude whispered conversations or showing and pointing at cards or the reference sheet, since you had a pencil and all that information at hand. Since you can't show cards and can't talk secretly, it'll become impossible for allies to usefully coordinate on battle plans, especially common things like "I know leader X is safe" or (for the Atriedes-equivilent) "I know he doesn't have a defense so ask what weapon he's using". The inability to do this stuff seems pretty sketchy. This would have been much better to simply suggest an option, but ultimately leave to player preferences.

Some of the more mechanical updates are similarly bizarre - why can't we just put the weapons/defenses up against the dial like we used to, instead of this strange new two-step process? Also, why is influence open now? It'll satisfy a niche that complains loudly, but in general doesn't seem like a good idea. My suspicion is that both of these rules derive from the fact that there isn't a player screen anymore.

While after reading the rules I am cautiously optimistic about Rex, it's interesting to note how many of the changes seem driven not by the desire to produce a better game, but by a) a desire to eliminate written record-keeping; b) component cost tradeoffs; c) eliminating the possibility of illegal plays; and d) the elimination of the need for players to track any state at all, even when those decisions may compromise gameplay. The new mechanics for tracking "Bene Gesserit" coexistence state (two-sided tokens that you flip) seem like an example of a mediocre sledgehammer solution to a minor problem that will probably make gameplay a lot more awkward. The new multi-step battle resolution - playing a leader and predesignating types of cards, then subsequently playing weapon/defense cards after the first reveal, seems both awkward and also deprives the game of a big tension/release point. Not thrilled by that.

Sill. Dune is a tremendous classic game that I don't play enough because even though games usually come in at 2-4 hours, outliers can go very long. If Rex eliminates the possibility of 8-plus-hour slugathons, that could be a huge deal in terms of getting the game played, even if it loses something along the way. I suspect I'll end up house ruling things like secret diplomacy back to the way we played Dune.

As for losing the Dune backstory ... well, it's a bummer. And it's a shame FFG had to go with their own slightly lame in-house universe instead of picking a nice historical period; I hear the original game was Roman-themed, which might have been fun. Dune is a great example though of a game design which is quite expressive even without any thematic veneer, so I expect that the TI universe will be enriched by the game rather than the game being compromised by the universe.

I played tons of Dune at school and love it. It always felt well balanced and was short for such a thematic game. Fantasy Flight have not made enough changes to make Rex its own game. However, all the changes that they have made look like they will make the game worse. No care seems to have been given to how changes will affect game balance. It is like a poorly thought out set of house rules. If it is true that Asmodee are going to reprint Dune, I can see little to recommend this game.

Comparison with Dune is inevitable. But for me, Rex has better rules, better clarification, and better gameplay experience overall. It's shrewd negotiation and cunning play packed into one solid game. The only thing that I miss is the ability to bribe other players anytime. 

I could see why Dune veterans will still love Dune better. If you have played Dune 20+ times, and will continue to do so with frequency about 10 times each year, I believe you will like Dune better. But for limited experience with Dune, and won't play that many, Rex is better.

Preliminary rating after playing it first time.  Think this could likely go either way, depending on how it repeats at our family game night.  Moves fast considering it is a longer game.  Not much downtime, and fun coop/adversary dynamic.  A little more direct than I like, but good.

After a few more plays here's why it's still a 7: It's a little lopsided, as eliminating a player early on is fairly simple if you have a dependable helpmate willing to bank on an alliance.  The game system doesn't self-correct in a way to tighten competition.  Overall, the lopsided elements of the game keep it from advancing higher in my rankings.

Fun though!  I enjoy playing it- simple rules, complex play is appealing.

After reading some of the other reviews you have to wonder if these people even played the game, even though they claim to have.  For example, one person said he couldn't stand the bombardment cards and would have rather just rolled a D6.  Well if you do that, how does the SOL evade the bombardment ahead of time?

From the point of view of a person who doesn't work in the board gaming industry (or anything related), it looks like FFG either has enemies or they didn't write a big enough check to the "online reputation" companies.  These OR companies have always looked like black mail companies and actions similar to the reviews for this game back up those kind of observations.  

So if you are a "real customer" looking at this game, there appears to be a lot of clutter surrounding this game.  Watch out.

Anywho, most of the harsh criticism for this game seems really unfounded.  Can certain teams win the first turn?  Yep!  But it would take the entire other team to play like toddlers for it to happen.

Is it balanced?  No!  And that's the point of these kind of "Diplomacy +" titles.  You are supposed to talk about what is happening and not play solitaire.  If a player gets ahead, its not the job of the rest of the players to stand aside and let him cruise to victory.  Nor is it "bad manners" to team up and crush him down!

Like many other Diplomacy like titles this one does a good job but does it rapidly.  The games are fast and furious (fast is of course relative).  Great game, hope to keep it active in our group for a long time.

Basically [i]Dune[/i] re-themed to get around the licensing issues. Which I don't have a problem with. The components are all upgraded, of course, so the game looks a lot better. Plus, FFG has shortened the game to 8 turns which brings down the playing time nicely without seriously affecting the game, although it does pretty much guarantee a "Sol, turn 8" prediction by the Bene Gesserit. Oops, I mean the Xxcha.

Anyway, my rating is same as it is for Dune. It's a fun game, but it really isn't all that deep.

There was less diplomacy and back stabbing in this game than in standard TI3, which surprised me.  It's all about board position, who knows what, and who can help you when you need it, but only 2 or 3 times per game (in a cease fire) which is a great mechanic.  The game moved fast, was relatively rules light, and just worked.  I can see why everyone holds Dune in such high regard now.  I will only play this with 6 players.

Rex. A calling card back to days when games were only for the hardcore.

This is a long, complicated, unbalanced and difficult game. And until everyone gets very, very good at it, the Hacan will win nearly every time.

That is, until the Xxcha realise it. Then they'll guess "Hacan 8," and they'll win every time.

I've played this with full-on gamers. It confused and bewildered us.

There's a lot of rules to digest. Three plays in, and we still find scenarios like "Oooooh, you can only resurrect up to 5 soldiers per turn."

At its best, this divests into a series of strange metagames - like never bidding when the Empire has a three person alliance.

Movement of units is oddly restrictive. You can move one clump of guys per turn. Then you can deploy one clump of guys per turn. Multiple dudes on the board? Too bad. Considering you only have 8 turns and you're trying to claim three stronghold areas, this can lead you into situations that are impossible to win.

Speaking of winning, it's possible to win on turn 1 if you are the Letnev. Which is un-fun, and shouldn't be possible. It puts the players who have turn order either side of the Letnev into a Prisoners' Dilemma; either cripple themselves to prevent the Letnev from winning (and likely lose), or allow the Letnev to win and lose the game instantly.

Combat is brain burning. There is a correct path of logic to take, that is emphasised by allying with the Xxcha or the Jol'Nar (who have special abilities centered around information during combat). Any one mistake in this path of logic results in you losing everything.

I'm probably going to play a six player game of this one last time. Then I'm going to sell it.

You might like it, but it wasn't for me.

Apart from me not being a fan of Fantasy Flight Games, this one is also just plain bad game. You run around the map, trying not to get cought by bombardment. You try not to get close to 2 enemies, but at the same time close to victory points. If you win battle, you still loose your committed units. So if 2nd enemy is close by you become easy target. On top of all, it is pure king-maker. It just didn't bought me. Maybe I could be talked into giving it another chance.

edit: after second game, in six players I just can't give this game more than 1 (I gave it 4 for the first time - apparently I was in REALLY good mood that day :) ). This game is worse even than Bas-Celik (which I thought was impossible to be worse than). After this second game, owner said, and I quote him: "I will have to either bury this game somewhere DEEP in my closet, or I will have to throw it in a garbage".

Rex is re-themed Dune with a few modifications, the most notable being the lack of hidden negotiations.

One complaint, similar to Dune, is that the ability to form 3-way alliances creates quite an imbalance as the strong ally with the strong and the weak are left to try to survive.  Nevertheless, the unique powers of each race, all of which are imbalancing in themselves, create quite a rich interplay of tactics and can somewhat mitigate the alliance benefits

One major concern is the randomness of some of the events and cards that can create a sudden swing or even game win seemingly by luck.  The traitor mechanic is the most blatant of these.  It does for sure though add an element of tension and uncertainty.

I think to truly enjoy this game, it needs several plays to flesh out the optimal way to play the races. I would love to get more plays in if I can still find players not turned off by their first play.

Dissappointed in this.

Played one six player game where there was no oppertunity to make/break alliances. Traitor cards were difficult to acquire, when the game ended we all felt that we had only played half a game and there must be more to this that we had missed.

Overly simple war game with very little area control aspect, and virtually no intrigue/diplomacy.

I did not want to like this game as much as I did. I am one of those who thought Dune wasn't Dune without the theme. It's a real shame FFG didn't get the license from the Herbert estate, because the tweaks they made to the game were absolutely fabulous. Given the choice between rulesets, I would take this one every time. They shortenned the length of the game and removed a lot of fiddliness. This would be a ten if it had the Dune theme I think.

Had a first 6 player game today. We were all new to the game and the first turns took some time. The basic mechanics of the game is fairly simple but racial advantages and special victory conditions complicate things a bit to new players. The game probably is even more enjoyable once you get to know the strengths of the different factions. All in all a good first impression, but there is still lots of things to discover in the game.

Look at Agricola. Now back to Rex. Now back to Agricola. Now back to Rex. Sadly, Agricola is not Rex. Agricola has a tight set of mathematically based rules, is low on player confrontation, and promotes a feel-good attitude where you'll walk away from a game feeling happy, like you accomplished something.

[b][i]Rex[/i][/b], on the other hand, will end with you feeling like you destroyed something (or were destroyed yourself). Imagine the following: Your opponent has attacked you to win the game, and is choosing which leader to play. Confident, you stare her/him down with a slight smile as you hold a single traitor card in your hand daring them to play their best leader. Are you bluffing? The tension rises, and nervously they reveal their selection to be a weaker leader that might not win the battle, but which they attacked you with at an earlier point. Ha! The joke's on them because this was the leader who is actually a traitor; you had ingeniously saved it earlier to use in a more important battle. Victory is yours! Your opponent slumps in their chair, utterly defeated. Cheers and high-fives all around!

A game of Rex makes stories. If this sounds fun to you, then I highly recommend Rex.

Never played Dune before but playing this was an experience. Reminded me a lot of cosmic encounter but with more political theme and better combat system. I love the interaction between players. All the factions have great powers that work well on their own on in allied factions. Great balance and can't wait to play it more. Same as cosmic encounter in the way of interaction, and how dependant it is on the people you play it with. The more you play it, the better it gets, the more strategy unveils the more you understand how the races interact.

RATING: 8.5
A kind of postmodern game - it's meat is in the meta levels, and as such it's a game that requires a few playings to get the hang of. If you compare it to other conflict games it will have you fooled at a few turns. It has a much more loose feeling to it.
Most of the game comes out in the interaction between players - the alliances, the payments going back and forth, information being traded and so on.
If all you're interested in is how to manipulate mechanics to orchestrate a win, this is not for you.

Unbalanced. Certain races, especially in partnership with other races, can dominate play. In addition, if a player suffers a large loss early (Sol event, battle, or bombardment), he is essentially out of the game for several turns if not the entire game. In my play, on turn 2, I suffered a Sol event and battle loss which wiped out my entire force. It took me until the last turn before I had a force that I could do anything with and even then it wasn't capable of taking on others who had been building forces and consolidating for 7 turns. So for 3 hours I did nothing but watch others play.

RATING: 5
Played once with 6 players. Not my style of game. I get confused and simply can't hold the level of concentration required. I play in a bit of a daze without giving my goes the required level of thought to play optimally. I can't remember which cards people have previously played (Ok, I'm not thick, it is more the case that I can't be bothered to try and remember) or what their special abilities are. I sometimes don’t remember to use my own special powers. With repeat plays I would get more on the case and even in my first game I did enjoy being a part of the whole 6 player experience. When I play games like this (Game of Thrones and Runewars have the same vibe) I am really taking one for the team. Ninety minute Euros are more my thing but I am happy to mix it up. March 2012

Rex is fantastic. The races are very distinct, the alliances are different from any game I've played and they work brilliantly. They can only be accepted or broken in specific moments in the game, you share your ability with your allies - but the winning condition gets harder!
The race's powers are wildly different and give players a lot of control over aspects of the game. Also replayability, because now I want to try them all.
The fights are a sequence of difficult decisions that work very well. Winning is costly.
Expect diplomacy, intrigue and betrayal. It's some of the most fun I've had with a boardgame.

1st play was with 3 and I think it worked as a learning experience before getting up to 4-6 players.  There were some great moments of tension as the game started to finish with all of us figuring out how we could win, or at the very least how to defeat the player who looked like they were about to.  I, as the Sol player managed to hold onto my key Stronghold, while helping to prevent the other 2 players from getting their 3rds, for the end game win. I think this will be even more fun with more players so that alliances can be formed and betrayed too.

RATING: 5.5
While I am a Dune fan-boy I went into Rex hoping for and expecting the best. I always say that if you're playing Dune as a war game or trying to win through attrition then you've lost before you start. With Rex, the desire to speed up the gameplay has taken all the nuance and elegance of Dune and stripped it down to where it does play more as a war game that can be won 'at the table' through brute force. For that, give me Kemet, for negotiation, bluffing and subterfuge, give me Dune - just don't ever give me Rex...

It is shorter than Dune, which is mostly for the good. It's still crazy and a bit wonky, and the timing of the diplomacy rounds is more fragile given the condensed timeline. The graphic design (especially of the board) is a mess, though.

Joc de negociació i combat amb aliances entre jugadors que permeten guanyar en grup. És gairebé obligatori jugar 6 i prohibir les aliances de 3.

Tot i que no té massa a veure en mecàniques, a mi l'experiencia de joc em recorda a un Cosmic Encounter amb moltes més regles i sense tant caos.

What this loses in theme (compared to Dune) it makes up for in being slightly faster, slightly more accessible, and still capturing 99% of what made Dune a great game.  

A very simple and tense (no luck) combat system, a simple set of resource management rules that create a deep and interesting economy, and intricately balanced factions with fun special powers make for a great gaming experience. I'm very happy FFG reprinted this so more people can experience Dune. 

Our first game with multiple new players and a full rules explanation lasted just over two hours.  I'm pretty sure you can whittle this down to 90 minutes if everyone knows how to play and things move fairly fast.  The two hour mark will be reserved for games that come down to turn eight and the special victory conditions.

I have not played with the new betrayal cards but I am excited to try them.

RATING: 5
An in print re-themed Dune. Some subtle but in important changes to the rules make the game more accessible to some but less enjoyable to me. The changes in Spice/Influence collection make the Atriedes/Harkonnen players much weaker than the original IMHO.

The board is beautifully produced but looks like coffee was spilt all over it. A recurring theme in FF boards of late.

It has some potential but is way too random and chaotic to really feel like you have much control over the game.

Rating from only one play.

I usually like when races are very asymetrical, but i'm not shure that they are balanced in this one. Some races get Influence all the time from all the players & some others don't get influence at all. And since you need influence for everything.. i don't know. The Bomber fleet that keeps bombing the city unintermittingly is plain silly.. sure in Dune it was the sandstorm & made sense.. but the fleet, no way.
Components are very good quality.

[b]Thoughts after first play:[/b]

Rex, AKA "Wrecks"

Really, very nifty.  The wildly asymmetrical player powers make for interesting combinations during alliances, the whole thing being a variable machine the players can construct as they go—a machine that spends most of the time shuddering sideways while gloriously out of whack; much of the experience is spent desperately trying to get everything back in balance, only to have it veer madly into crazyland again.  But that's what makes it memorable—it's rife with delicious quintuplethink and opportunities for clever play.

The shoehorned [i]Twilight Imperium[/i] IP, which is, according to FFG's marketing, "rich, vibrant, and evocatively adjectival", is okay, I guess, though it does end up making it feel more like David Lynch's 1984 adaptation of [i]Dune[/i]—a familiar thing bent in weird ways.  It's definitely in the "milk the cat" category.

[imageid=2745432 original]

[b]After 3 plays:[/b]  So far this is a "birthday game"  where I can only manage to get it played once a year by forcing everyone to do so on my birthday.  This is unfortunate as it's clear this relatively straightforward experience requires constant contact in order to mature into what it's supposed to be.  You're playing learning games until all six players are intimately familiar with the various powers, which means it's not the Real Deal until that seventh game.  If we're only playing it once a year it's going to be a very long time before that happens—and even then, blowing the dust off it annually leads to victories that hinge on the losers' ignorance of the rules, which aren't really victories after all.

Pretty well-balanced strategy game, with a good mix of diplomacy/metagame decisions added in.  The mechanics seemed very sound.

You do have to understand your faction's ideal strategy, since some factions will out-gain others on a macroeconomic level.  Some races have to play rush, while others don't.  But if you understand that, it's fun.

I love the theme (Twilight Imperium) and alliance system of this game (unique mechanic). When I first got this game, it did not see much play; you need people who can play aggressively and that is NOT my gaming group. Because my gaming group was not the right fit for this game, the games I did play were just OKay. But, We did try the game again recently and WOW. At the end of EVERY round you felt like you were just about to win and also one of your opponents was just about to win, too. Every round felt like the climax of a a full game. People were cheering, booing, and exited over every one's move because every move seemed like it could lead to someone's victory. You were not building up resources and waiting for future moves, no. you were engaged every round. People were laughing and excited as battles were won and loss. I still remember some of the moments of that game 1 month later. The rules are simple, and easy to teach. I look forward to playing this again!

Initial Rating: 7.0 (October 2015)

I finally played Rex: Final Days of an Empire. As I love Dune (a game that until last month was in my Top Ten Favorite games) I cannot help but compare them. The verdict? I like Rex, but Dune is the better game by far for me but I enjoyed Rex.

Rex can be explained under 30 minutes and play around 2 or 3 hours. As it is based on Dune, it is one of the best diplomacy/factions style games.

As is usual from FFG, the art an components are very well done and the game continues to be fun. Now to the comparison (although I haven’t read Rex´s rules):

•	The game components, map´s size and game art are, by far, much better in Rex. In fact, the difference is so staggering that it is almost silly to compare them. Dune´s components aren’t the best, but the game was printed decades ago. However, about the components, I dislike that the leaders get stuck on the battle dial very easily and when you do some force to remove them they suffer. I feel like they will degrade quickly.

•	Rex´s theme is fun, but it can’t really compete with Dune´s, a theme that has a very powerful pedigree. After I played Dune for the first time I read the books and I can attest that game is really thematic. I know FFG couldn’t reprint Dune´s theme, but I prefer the old theme nonetheless.

•	Most of the optional powers of the factions  were removed.  That’s kind of sad but I guess FFG can bring them back with an expansion.   

•	FFG removed all the “worthless” cards, due to this the bids are much less tense and the power that can see the cards (Atreides/Jol-Nar I believe) is less powerful too. I always loved the way Atreides could bluff and made someone pay a lot of spice for a crappy card. I prefer the Dune way because you never knew what you were bidding for. Now you always know the card will be powerful/important for something.  In the same vein all Karama cards were removed which is also a shame and the Fremen Karama power (summoning a worm) is now a card that every faction can use. I dislike this because it is such a powerful card and it is pure luck if you get it or not. 

•	The graphic design is gorgeous but nonfictional. In Dune, seeing where the storm could hit was a breeze. In Rex you need to count every time because it isn’t instinctive.

•	Everything is open in Rex. You cannot make plans secretly among allies and everyone know how much influence/spice you have at any time. I prefer the Dune way here as well, but I feel this change isn’t so bad. On the other hand I LOVE that you cannot write things down. I always love when memory is important in a game but I concede it can make Atreides/Jol-Nar a lot weaker if he forgets the cards. I prefer to play with secret influence. 

•	Now you cannot give spice/influence at the end of the turn. This change bothers me because now I cannot bribe someone to attack a third party or offer spice/influence to avoid an attack. This kind of bribery was removed. I recognize this change makes Rex a faster game but I still miss it.

•	The game´s turns were decreased from 15 to 8. This change doesn’t bothers me in the least. Most of my Dune´s games are finished before the 8 turns due to alliances so having a (potentially) faster game is for the best. However, this change makes the Bene Gesserit/Xxcha faction much stronger because it is easier now to successfully fulfill a prophecy. I’m not sure about this but I think on Dune the prediction didn’t work if Fremen or Guild fulfilled their end of game victory. I have never played a Dune game of 15 turns so I don’t remember from the rules, but on Rex, the Xxcha prophecy does encompass the special victory of Sol/Hacan. I dislike this because it weakens  these factions. Besides the spirit of the prophecy was to manipulate the game to fulfill it (that’s why Bene-gesserit is my preferred faction) but now it seems very easy and obvious to predict the victory of Sol/Hacan at the end of the 8th turn. 

•	Now you can have free for all battles, even on strongholds. On Dune, only two factions could fight in a stronghold. I’m not sure how I feel about this change, perhaps it was better before because the game was more strategic, but also longer so I guess this changes makes the game faster.

•	The amount of influence/spice you have to pay to ship to a contested location is doubled now. I like this change because it makes thematic sense and it helps the defender BUT I’m worried it could unfairly help the rich factions. I need to play more to see if this is an issue for me.

•	There are less locations on Rex. I like this change because it makes for a tenser game. On a related note the Pole/Galactic Council is no longer connected to many terrains, but only to two terrains. As one of them is a port I don’t mind.

•	The order of the game phases was changed as well, but I need to play more to see which one I prefer.

•	Leader revivals make the battle less tense. Now battles aren’t as scarier as before. On Dune when you lost a leader bringing him back was very hard and it makes a lot more thematic sense.

•	Among  all the changes Rex made to Dune´s gameplay, the most PAINFUL to me is that now the deals between players don’t need to be honored. I’m very sad about this. I remember when I read Dune´s rules that I liked (and was surprised) this part a lot. It is very sad that FFG decided to remove a characteristic that made Dune very different (perhaps unique as far as I know) from other games in this genre, now it is one more of the pack, that is, all of the diplomatic/negotiation games allow betrayal in any form and one´s word doesn’t mean anything at all. I will try to house rule it but the odds of that happening are very low as my game group always play with the rules as written. For this reason alone, I feel Dune´s the better game.

Bottom line, I feel Rex: Final Days of an Empire is less of a game. I recognize that many things were removed/changed to streamline the game and to make it faster, I also recognize that I’m a Dune fanboy so every change FFG made to the game can be seen as a bad choice for me. I’m biased :D, but I feel almost all the changes were for the worst. Still I like Rex and I won’t say no when requested, but I prefer to play Dune over Rex any day.

RATING: 8
Almost 30 years since I last played Dune, played my first game of Rex, and it was good.

It's still an excellent design with smooth mechanics. It's not so much complex as multi-layered (if you embrace unpredictability) or chaotic (if you prefer luckless predictability). In particular, an unfortunate traitor can turn an odds-on battle win into a costly disaster. (Twice in a row in my case...).

Not a short game, unless you have experienced players who make snap decisions. That said, it's designed to play more quickly than the original, with a cap of 8 rounds and slightly more generous mechanics (money isn't quite as tight, leaders defeated in battle aren't automatically killed, meaning you can recover more quickly from a bad battle loss).

The production quality is fantastic, albeit while I'm not a massive fan of the Dune world some of the re-themed races are a little too teenage American (eye patch wearing Lions who specialise in ... trading? Sci-fi turtles?) for this middle-aged Scot.

RATING: 9
Rex is best described as the brainchild of the well-oiled game mechanics featured in Dune, along with the richly immersive theme of Twilight Imperium. In short, Rex proves to have just the right amount of combat, treachery, and deceit to keep players on edge from beginning to end. A typical session generally lasts about 2 to 3 hrs.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A solid re-implementation of Dune.  I was never a hard core Dune fan.  It has always been a game my group would play from time to time, and enjoy.  From my perspective, the new edition fixes some of the problems of the old Dune.  The game is shorter now, which feels right.  Don't worry, it is definitely not too short!

The combat resolution is a little different, and feels to me as though it has one too many steps.  Basically you choose the number of troops you are willing to sacrifice, choose a leader and hide him while also telling the opponent how many attack and defense cards you are willing to play, reveal the leader, and then reveal the attack/defense cards.  Couldn't all the cards be revealed at once?  I guess you can't hide how many cards you are playing behind a screen like you used to be able to.  We may house-rule this if I ever get around to making up screens.

Aside from that complaint, Rex is great, and we've all had a good time playing it, even players who had never had a chance to try the original Dune.

Intersting that the mechanics of the game reveal to players almost all of the random information.  It is up to your alliance to make the most of the information revealed to it.

First play was fairly conservative - an alliance of three (Lazax, Lentev, Jol-Nar) dominated the game from round 2 until it ended in round 4.

I always felt over extended, but it did not seem to do much harm in the end - I held onto 2 of the strongholds.

Looking forward to more plays.

Note: I have no experience what so ever with Dune.

While an interesting little "Diplomacy-esque" game (in that you are really playing the players more than you are the game), I think there are other games that do what this tries to do better (such as A Game of Thrones: The Board Game, or in a lighter format Cosmic Encounter).  Also has bad player scaling issues.

Some I've played this with have not liked it.  It's certainly not for everyone.  I grew up playing Dune so I am predisposed to not just like but understand the gameplay here.  What seems random to a new player seems to me a factor I need to influence and control as much as possible through my unique character powers.  In a lot of regards there just isn't another game system out there much like this one.  I'm not a fan of the board in comparison to the way it was in Dune but I don't mind any other aspect of this new theme.  I had the expansions for the original Dune version as well but they don't seem necessary to me now.   I don't have a large enough or interested enough group to keep a game like this in my collection but I'd gladly play someone else's copy.

Rex suffers, and greatly, from the loss of the Dune theme. Even though its mechanisms have been streamlined, it's got too much chrome for its own good. That same chrome was present in Dune, but it fit the theme perfectly, making the game super absorbing. Here, it just feels out of place.

Knife fight in an elevator. Cooperative yet insanely competitive. Both crazily swingy (traitors) and balanced on the razor's edge (some fights).

First game was over in one round. Second lasted 8 and led to a thin allied victory thanks to Hacan's game timer.

I now have a whole new appreciation for the original Dune design, with further refinements by FFG.

If you have 6p who love intrigue, play it.

Rex: Final Days of an Empire, a reimagined version of Dune set in Fantasy Flight's Twilight Imperium universe, is a board game of negotiation, betrayal, and warfare in which 3-6 players take control of great interstellar civilizations, competing for dominance of the galaxy's crumbling imperial city. Set 3,000 years before the events of Twilight Imperium, Rex tells the story of the last days of the Lazax empire, while presenting players with compelling asymmetrical racial abilities and exciting opportunities for diplomacy, deception, and tactical mastery.

In Rex: Final Days of an Empire, players vie for control of vital locations across a sprawling map of the continent-sized Mecatol City. Only by securing three key locations (or more, when allied with other factions) can a player assert dominance over the heart of a dying empire.

This is a good political game.  I think the event deck needs to be built "pandemic style" to ensure the alliance cards appear at reasonable points during the game.  If they do not appear, or appear to early in the game, it can really ruin the balance and make the game unnecessarily long and cumbersome during/between turns.

The board is a bit of a mess, and the Dune theme works better for the factions and mechanics than the TI one, but otherwise this is the best team/shifting alliance strategy game out there for six players.

The rules are simple, the experience cagey and bloody and deceitful, but it's also brilliantly different for every player, and structured enough to drive on to its conclusion without wearing the players out.

The crazily assymetric design is great. Can suffer from slippery slope if you get behind.

RATING: 3
If you wondering which game to try or buy between this game and dune (even if dune is out of print), I strongly suggest you play Rex. They simplified a few things but mostly streamlined the rules. The map design is also better.

But for me, that game is still as horrible as the original, and when I learned that the original designers made "cosmic encounter", it now makes sense why the original game was so bad.

If you hate this game, but you would have loved to like it, try dune express. It's removes the boring tactical parts like auctions bidding battles and keep the fun strategy parts like alliances.

--------------------------------------------

Now regarding Rex, the game I played went pretty wrong, I lost 3 battles on the first turn leaving me no units on the board. Since you need money to drop units and unit to get money, well guess what, you are screwed.

Only 2 players actually had an high amount of money due to their special powers, and it's always them who runs the game in my point of view because you need money to do every thing but you always lack of money. In Rex, you get 2 influence(money) per turn to keep you alive, but it is barely enough to do anything. And personally, I would have preferred being eliminated instead of being kept alive.

Using the Betrayal option puts the game firmly into the canon of Twilight Imperium lore: at the end of the game everyone betrays everyone, the galaxy sinks into civil war, which leads to the world found in Twilight Imperium. At the end of the rule book is a short story that is a suitably tragic and horrific account of the Lazax genocide. You can imagine the few broken survivors-their lust for revenge the only thing keeping them alive-turning into cyborgs over the millennia, slowly plotting to take back the universe.

Dune in the Twilight Imperium universe.  I still remember how much fun when I first played Dune and won the game with the Chairman of the local gaming society.  The betrayal stuff really intrigues the game to the next level.  I love Dune and with the license of that game not likely to be resolved for a new release like Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage or Titan, Rex should be the next best thing.

Rex is a Dune game re-themed; the Influence is the spice to collect, the fleet is the worm to destroy.

Got it for my birthday, very eager to try it out - though I'm also a bit afraid, as my experience with re-editions of old board games was generally negative.

I've heard such good things about this game but I'm wondering if I'll ever get to play it.  Sitting on my shelf since I purchased it.

Trade priority very low but willing to trade for something worthwhile.  Insert has been tossed.  Chits are stored in a storage box and all the cards have been sleeved. Some damage to the box.  Corners are crushed in a bit and one of the corners has been ripped.  Taped up.  The game itself is in great condition though.

The asymmetry in this game, combined with the hard counters that are impossible to predict unless you are a certain race (the Shield that explodes if targeted with a certain weapon comes to mind), along with the way Influence (money) is exchanged makes this to be more of a game which the player observes unfolding before them, as opposed to a game actually being played.

RATING: 7
Trying to be objective here, there's really nothing wrong with Rex as a whole, it's a solid game that does keep the core from Dune. However, to anyone that has experienced Dune, Rex is nothing but a castrated version, deprived of essential elements, including all private discussions, selling of information, sharing of information, Karama & Useless cards, etc. The game should play quickler than Dune, but frankly, I see no point in ever playing it again. Some say they like the board, I disliked the design.

Now - for some reason the theme of this one just doesn't seem to engage with me as much as Dune. Ultimately I prefer my home made dune set, despite the (minor) improvements in Rex.

Previously - I think FFG have hit the nail on the head in re-polishing the Dune experience for Rex. Have really enjoyed it so far.

The theme change from Dune is a sad loss, and the theme used here often feels tacked on. But mechanically, by tidying up some loose ends, streamlining play and removing some of the wilder elements of the original, I feel that it's slightly improved over the original.

Very cool game, which can be played fast or not.
Phases are quick enough though and the only downtime is when players stop to think on a move.

Not much luck involved, the battle system is really nice and the game forces itself to end at the 8th round.

Great game if you want strategy, interaction and only a small measure of luck.

An incredibly interesting area control combat game. The main issue I have with the game is that it should just be a requirement to play with 6 players. The lower player games are not as interesting. The bidding phase slows the game down, but the Jol-Nar player really dictates how that game goes, moreso than anyone else.

Rating is based on one very chaotic play. 

I might be talked into playing this again simply because I have no idea what happened in my only game. 

I think there's a game in there somewhere. On the surface, the game has elementals which I outright hate. Bidding on face down cards gives one absolutely no way to value one's bid. Faction powers appear either broken or useless. 

That having been said, I started to see some balance in the chaos, but then the game ended rather abruptly. 

I'd try it again. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I'm rating this low for one reason.  Lack of balance.  Each player gets a different race, with different special abilities.  As the number of players increases, the power of some special abilities rises, while the power of other special abilities decline.  There are two powers that get money every time a player does something.  More players=more money.  There's another that gets to deploy troops for free when someone else deploys troops.  Meanwhile, other powers remain constant as the number of players goes up, but the chance of successful employment of those powers drops.  In terms of balance, the game is broken.

Also, I found the combat system very odd.  Several small assaults will inevitably break a much larger army, so much so that it creates a good amount of bluffing as part of the combat.  That's a bit more randomness than I usually expect in a combat game.

Finally, the box says three hours, but we took almost twice that to play a six player game.

That being said, it's actually a fairly entertaining game.  Even though I spent six hours with an underpowered special ability, I still remained fairly entertained, and though struggling, there was at least a small, dim, hope of victory even at the end.  I hadn't figured I wasted my time playing it, and under the right circumstance, I might even play it again, but I can't see it being one of my favorites.

Second Review:  Played this game for the second time this weekend with four players.  This is the best board game experience I've ever had thus far, and have updated it to a 10.

I've read some of the reviews that hate this game and I find that while some of their issues may have merit, I find that you need to have SERIOUS gamers who are also INTERESTED in playing this game.  If you have someone who is just playing to play, this will affect the entire gameplay.


First Review:  Really enjoyed playing this game.  Played it once, and ended up playing it wrong (what do you expect when Fantasy Flight is still allowed to write rulebooks).

Much fun.  The very type of game I love to play.

Played this Game and I have the other twilight imperium games.Game to abstract for me not that I do not like abstract games but don't give me abstract game and then tell me it represents a battle but there is no way to even relate to the battle. The battle system sucks in my opinion... where both players commit forces and if you committed more forces you win except that when you win you lose all the forces you have committed. In my mind if I commit 20 forces against your one I will overrun your forces with minimal losses but not in this game. Combat system makes me feel completely detached from the game.

A nother thing is that if your opponent has one weapon and luck has not provided you with the counter card you better run from that player the whole game until you have the counter for his weapon to prevent him from killing  your leaders. If your leader is killed you will basically loose every battle except if it is such a small skirmish that it doesn't matter anyway.

The leaders that can be part of any battle on the board except if it already was part in a battle this turn also ruins it for me... How did his top general get from the one side of the board to the other...? It also makes it almost impossible to corner his leaders into a spot where you might start to knock of his leaders.

If you are like me and like a sense of atmosphere in your games and a sense of working systematically to a certain point this game is not for you.

Long long time ago, in the outer space, there used to be a masterpiece called [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/121/dune]Dune[/url]. In Dune, you played asymmetrical, hugely thematic roles for the control of a planet swept by storms: because the storms moved counterclockwise, the map was, of course, circular. So that we poor human beings could understand and plan accordingly.

Then ages passed, and the swinging FFG published this rethemed remake. Is it improved? [b]No way[/b]:
- point-to-point map, so you can't understand what's going on
- move first, then ship (this may be ok, for the new rules)
- combat is a joke, no match with the Dune's bluff and tension
- too easy to replace leaders, as well as other units
- non-binding verbal agreements... in a game about diplomacy (binding in Dune)
- [i]et cetera[/i]
Let alone the theme, but that's a personal taste. So, pick Rex if you've never experienced Dune and don't want to mess with a p&p version; otherwise, heading for the big one is a no-brainer.

I was disappointed when I learned that FFG could not get the licensing for Dune and I didn't have much interest in a re-themed game. I was wrong. Rex is great! The game is crunchy but easy to learn and play to conclusion fairly quickly.  I played two five-player games.  The first game took less than two hours and ended on turn three, and the second game took over four hours with all eight turns.  Traitors in combat seem to be more prominent than what I remember in Dune.  Anyway, I had a great time playing Rex and it would be a 10 if FFG could have gotten the Dune license.

Longer game times make this an all evening commitment for your group. Also, with a smaller group, rules as written cause teams to form early and rarely break. Some house rules (setting alliance cards) can fix this and help prevent run away winner. It can be hard to wrap your head around the play style for the different clans and the inability to blockade, but its still a decent game. Balanced if everyone is playing their clan with the same ability.

If you like Dune, you can definitely see the underlying inspiration (they couldn't get the licenses but it was supposed to be Dune Universe).

This is a remake of Dune, set in a the universe of Twilight Imperium. There have been a few rule changes,and the board has been changed as well. Players attempt to occupy victory point squares to win the game, but you can form alliances to win together. However, players are dealt betrayal cards at the beginning, which may allow them to be the sole winner of an alliance. The alliances don't appear to work too well in an odd number of player game.
I think this game appears best with 6 players, so all race factions are in the game. I've played twice with 5 players, and an unfair alliance doesn't make it fun for the others.

This 2012 edition reimplements the original Dune game from 1979, which remains an all-time favorite ranked in the top 100 of strategy games. The publisher could not purchase the rights to Dune, so they used the setting of one of their own games, Twilight Imperium.

First play was interesting.  I think this is one of those games that will require many more plays to provide an accurate rating.

This is one of those event games.

One of the best.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.1
Dune-as-TI3 translates... well, it's fighting 30+ years of player experience as Dune, and the Dune universe blends PERFECTLY with these rules.  But it does a fantastic job of taking a licensed property, stripping out the theme, and re-patching it.  The improvements are many, and almost universally for the better -- killing dud strategy cards, limiting House Harkonnen a bit, that sort of thing.

The downside, believe it or not, is the play length.  We got to Turn 8 and I was simultaneously relieved (as we were about to end our third hour on a weeknight) and very frustrated (as it felt like the game was suddenly getting very interesting, as if either alliance would resolve itself on Turn 9 or 10).  I'm not sure that a smaller time frame helps the experience.  It certainly makes it more palatable for first-time players, but I hope that FFG makes an expansion (ha!) that expands the length to the full 15 turns along with the cards to support that length.

The other downside is the same downside as Dune: You need players who are willing to stick the dagger in the back, who are copacetic with a little chaos and disorder, and who are able to spend the time to understand how all the microcosms work in conjunction with each other.  Players must learn what everyone's strengths are and how to maximize or neutralize them, and that won't come in a first-play.

That said, I'm glad FFG reprinted it.  I'm glad I own it.  But Jesu Christo, did you need to include six pages of fan-fic in the rulebook?  Really?  (Actually, yeah.  Yeah, you kinda did.)

I had previously played [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/184429/item/3863204#item3863204]Dune[/url] this year, and the experience was not satisfying. I was told that it was probably due to the expanions and I was advised not to use them again. Because of that, I sold my Spanish copy of Rex even without playing it, but then I regretted it, because some people says it features some improvements over Dune. I bought an English copy on a deal and [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/play/details/16067871]I managed to convince Luis, Gerardo, Bruno and Ángel to try it wih me on September 27nd, at home[/url].

And yes, the gameplay is more or less the same, but there are some minor changes that probably improve it or speed it up. Nonetheless, the map is more confusing, especially when it comes to advancing the ship.

But most of all, if you have read the Dune novels or watched the movie, and then played the game, you realize that this game without a Dune theme doesn't make sense. Dune was a boardgame tailored to reflect its specific universe and it's probably the most thematic boardgame ever. Almost every rule reflects some reality of the book. It's like a made-to-measure suit. It will never look as good as it did for the guy it was made for.

It is still a "weak" game, weak meaning that it needs certain conditions to really shine (6 players, several gameplays for each of them, for example) and it doesn't work very well in some areas. But it's a game that will have a lot of appeal to those political game lovers, because it really encourages the alliance play and it features some unique elements (the specific moments to make/break alliances, or the asymetry of the races, the concession of abilities to the allies, etc.).

First impressions:

Really like this form of diplomacy game. The alliances have real teeth and it feels less slippery than, say, A Game of Thrones or of course Diplomacy itself.

There are a couple fuzzy elements in the rules that made the game last perhaps twice as long as it needed to (4 hours instead of 2ish, but it was 6 players and it was our first game, so I can't really say for sure). Nothing that screams OMG BROKEN but...a few confusing bits.

Componentry is nice. Map is freaking huge. The little fleet marker is gratuitous and wonderful, but hard to pack up without pulling it apart. How long can it last in the box? How many times can I assemble it?

I am concerned that the shared alliance victory stuff, where the Hacan and Sol players can share their special victory conditions, is tough to beat. In our first game, with all six people, Lazax, Hacan and Sol allied up and just had to hunker down until the end of the game. Very tough to deal with. Probably not impossible, but this was our first go so I'm sure some of the more obvious alliances will reveal themselves here in the next few plays.

Really enjoyed it overall. Quite elegant. This is the only game designed in the 80s that I've played that doesn't show its age. I'm wondering how close this is to the original Dune, and how cleaned up it is. Nice production.

Followup, 5/1/12: Wow! Six more players, totally different feel. We added Betrayal but to be honest I don't see the point of it: Betrayal cards are just there to fuck over the guys who helped you win in the first place. So...I don't know about that. Maybe that's good for some groups, but the team victory feels really good.

Pulled off a sweet top-level-dude traitor on the final fight of the game, forcing the Hacan victory condition for my alliance. Three-some hours of sitting quietly, waiting for that moment. So sweet. On par with the "cylon Admiral" win in BSG: Pegasus.

I feel like I need at least four more plays to at least give every race a spin. Twice now the Hacan alliance has proven to be very hard to actually beat. They may be straggly all game long but their role as official shit-stirrer is tough to overcome.

RATING: 6
Effectively the second re-make of Dune in the last 2 years, the other being Battle For Baghdad, but at least this one credits the original designers. Whereas the original is thematically superb, this one is a stretch and doesn't really make sense to me, so the game is relying on its mechanics. The rules have been tightened up nicely, and the number of rounds sensibly reduced to 8, but otherwise it really mechanically is very much the same, as is the feel and its upsides and downsides. Being, there aren't that many decisions to make in the game; its not continually engaging. You do the best you can with your power. The strength of these powers (and the ability to shoot for victory) waxes and wanes, and therefore for reasonable periods when you don't have a shot at it, there's not much of interest to do. However, the quality and importance of the decisions you make are crucial, as opposed to many multi-player games where there are numerous engaging decisions to make through the game but few in themselves are crucial. The other key elements to success seem to be psychology (the guessing games of what to commit in battle) and memory (who's holding what battle cards). The big attraction is the alliance capability with its scope for diplomacy and it's prerequisite setup to bring something to the negotiation table. I'm happy enough to play if others want to explore, as long as everyone's committed to keeping the game moving, especially the protacted battle uhm and uhm sequences.

Will have to play a few more times to make up mind on this but am liking this so far. It's definitely playable in around 2 hours which is great.

Based on one play: Another one of those games where each race has a special power that breaks all the rules. The standard game play is simple and the battles are interesting as you have to select how many ships to attack or defend with and what leader and card to use. All this is done in secret. But the powers make it odd and the alliances can only be forged at special times. Too many frustrating aspects.

I found the extreme randomness to be a huge buzz-kill. No matter how well you plan, and even if you completely outnumber your opponent, the antiquated Rock-paper-scissors combat mechanic can leave you completely frustrated. Through in secret 'traitor' cards than can totally nullify a stunning victory and the package just leaves you pissed off. 

WTF FFG?

This is ultimately a free-form negotiation game--here you're negotiating to be part of the "good" team and avoiding the "loser" team.  Yeah, there's other stuff going on, but that's what it seemed to boil down to.  Midway through the game you get to renegotiate teams, giving some advantage to people already on the good team, since they're already there.  I don't like this sort of game.  At all.

8/5/12 - First test game was a little boring. The fighting wasn't as dramatic as I thought and movement/deployment felt weak. Large armies crumble easily and it seems too hard to take over 3/4 objectives. I will play again and see how I like it. (Rating: 7)

8/6/12 - Played the game 2 more times and it definitely got much better after learning some of the nuances of each race and how they interact with each other. You have to stick with this game and play it at least 3 times with experienced people and you'll find that it's pretty rewarding. You really need to build/break/rebuild alliances and back stab each other to make the game fun. (Rating: 8)

10/17/12 - Ok, I tried it again and this time it sucked bad. I almost wanted to scoop up in the middle of the game. It's so slow and the attacks are lame and you don't have enough money/moves to do much. I'm definitely downgrading and trading it. (Rating: 6.5)

Bad Mechanics:
 Winning on first turn of the game TWICE. This was due to turn order/race but there is a 33% change that the last player can try to win on the first turn of the game and they its just in the cards.
 Huge variability in the combat cards/blind card play is much stringer then armies.  This is ignoring the even bigger swings with traitors.  The combat cards can completely kill an enemy leader cutting their forces in half or more, or do nothing at all.  Worse some players may get non/useless cards and never be able to win a battle.
 Random mechanic to blow up things not he board/movement and replacement rules are bizarre and not strategic in any way.  Further more the air fields are broken and give the controllers instant access to two other VP's where ar it normally takes two full turns to get to one other VP.
 Rules are terrible, some setup not covered or only in diagrams.  Some rules are printed wrong int he book and changed in errata(how influence is claimed).
 Components are good for the most part the the dials won't even fit together.  Also the "snap in" part of the leaders will wear down the bits quickly and damage them.  there is no way around this as it is needed to lock in the card selections.

Very good game. I don't mind the retheme (Twilight Imperium is fine in my book. Overated sometimes, but fine). The game feels Duneish still, however, there is no denying it. My only nitpick is actually the fleet, it feels weird somehow, particularly to those that are not familiar with the TI universe. I would have something else, like a gargantuan intergalactic monster gone loose or something.

I have downloaded Ilya's Dune readaptation (Dune is the original game), but have no idea when, and if, I'm going to assemble it (it's quite a lot of stuff).

Rex is... interesting.
It's an area control war game, but to play it like a conventional one is a sure way to loose.  In most such games, units are an expensive resource that you must manage efficiently to win.
In Rex, they're here today and gone tomorrow.  You never know what random card will be drawn from the deck to decimate your forces, or what terrible card will be played against you when entering a fight with another player.
Initially my friends and I disliked it.  It felt far too random and pointless. Strategy and tactics were simply irrelevant all game long.
But after another couple plays we started to understand its weird flow.  Tactical army use isn't the name of the game.  Rather, more emphasis is placed on who you can work with at the table to create a joint engine capable of raising the funds to build and deploy armies as fast as you loose them in the field.

I really like a lot of the ideas present here: radicallly asymmetrical factions, fascinating combat mechanics, and the ever present threat of the massive bombing fleet...
But after a few plays now, I can safely say it just did not quite come together into a game I'd reach for again.

Having read a lot about the original Dune, I had great expectations for this game. And it did indeed lived up to them. What would probably be just a 'meh' game becomes a great game due to the incredibly asymmetric powers of each race, that lead to a very different play-style. Good stuff :D

The only drawback is the theme. Race powers make a lot more sense in the Dune universe than in the Twilight Imperium one. Another example of why copyright laws are broken.

Rex is an interesting game that is a ton of fun when you get to a high level of play. At the lower levels, it can seem very confusing as to what to do.

I like the game a lot because it does many things right. I like how each faction feels very different from the next and has their own powers and weaknesses. I like how the board is functionally great for games of multiple player sizes unlike Game of Thrones. I like how the combat system is both cerebral, yet simple, a very elegant and quick design. I like the alliance system where it is binding unless a new one is decided at certain events in the game.

Here are my gripes. I think the game might have too many strategy card types. Unless you play the game a lot, you probably won't remember what a Informant does or how many cards there are in the deck. I also find that not having a weapon is a huge disadvantage and is difficult to play against someone who does have one. The game could be a bit shorter as well.

So it's a good game and I'm happy to play it with like-minded people, but new players should probably play something else.

Rex has a lot of potential to be fun if all players understand the rules completely. The races dictate a lot of each player's strategy and if you don't know how to play your race properly it will usually result in a quick death, or worse, 8 rounds of nothing.

The mechanics are tight, but the game is just too prone to error for me. I've yet to get a play in that I've really enjoyed. Maybe one day.

An epic war game distilled to just the critical factors: alliance-making, tactical movement, battle and betrayal. It skips the whole economic base which allows 6 players to focus on shafting one another. Battle is non-random and theoretically known as one player will see all the cards people are buying. Multiple paths to victory, multiple paths to betraying your allies. In short: brilliant.

Enjoyed the games I played for this game which is tense and furious each time with plenty of environmental factors, an interesting "traitor" mechanism, fun asymmetric faction powers and a brilliant alliance system that all works well together. Some races are better than others though and feel that the Hacans and are overpowered with their strong economy, deployment abilities and default win condition. 

Downgraded after I played Dune which made this game pale so much in comparison, esp in theme and game balance.

I like this game. It's quite simple (and much much simpler than its big brother Twilight Imperium), yet all about interaction and negotiations (much more than its big brother). Which I thought I would dislike (I don't like it in City of Horrors), but I love it in this game. The fun of the game really depends on your co-players though, and I wonder if I would still like it after three or more games. I'm not sure it would bring enough challenge and variation on the one side (although it really leaves you light-headed halfway the game) nor enough mindless entertainment on the other.

24-02-2014. I love this game. For me, the area control and abilities to constantly back-stab your friends is just great. With 6, it plays relatively quickly too (I think we average around 3-4 hours), which is quite long but since you're involved and double-thinking so much it doesn't feel long. The game is not heavy, as it's mechanics are simple, but a lot of the strategy in the game is utilizing your limited information and many degrees of freedom to maneuver into a relatively safe position. 

Two people in my gaming circle have it. I love the game, but it seems like a game I don't currently need to have in my own collection (although it would never hurt if I can get it at a good price).

It's a shame that FFG had to go without the Dune license, because the game was pretty clearly designed to go with it. However, if that's not possible, then Rex will have to do. And you know what?

Rex is a pretty cool game.

The original Eon team was so ahead of their time that separated from the Dune setting, the game still feels incredibly modern. It's a fine refinement of interaction and variety. After three games, all three have been totally different experiences. The variables that construct the game can change wildly from session to session, so the fact that Rex never goes off the rails at any point is a minor miracle. Like Cosmic Encounter, Rex is a game that see-saws so much that it somehow stabilizes.

The downside is that the game pretty much requires six people. My first two games were with five, and while it was fun it was clearly incomplete. To really get the full feeling of the game, you need six people. Only then will you really be able to see the game really fly.

*edit* Rex eventually ended up in the trade pile. It's not a terrible game, but I can't help but think that every move made to "shorten" the game created a new problem for FFG, and that each of those problems was dealt in a similarly artless way. I wish they had just slapped a different coat of paint on the original game, but they tweaked the powers, and the board, and everything else. It ended up feeling lopsided and weird. Out of five games, I only got one that was fantastic. That's not a good success rate, and it makes me think that Dune was probably how this game was meant to stay.

Rex felt really generic and a little too random to be considered a good game. Maybe as a step up from Risk it would be cool....

Not really into games like Rex, so I'll probably not play it again. But the way combat works was nice and I much prefer it over dice rolling that's for sure. I also liked how alliances were enforced by the game rules and could only be broken only at certain points. I am not a big fan of backstabbing in long games, so it was great.

Only one play - liked it, but found the card-knowledge issues a bit of a frustration - getting hosed by cards that you didn't even have an inkling of is a bit annoying, and suggests that you need a group to play this exclusively for a while to really appreciate it. Obviously, TI theme is pants compared to Dune, but otherwise I think FFG did a good job.

I think this game is better than an 8, but my first play was with only 4 players, and all 4 ceasefire cards came out in a single turn, so we were stuck with the alliances we made. Sorta of ruined the treachery part of the game for me. Second game, we made the mistake of allowing deployment in as many spaces as you could afford, which caused the hacan/lazax/jol-nar alliance to win easily in the second round.

Edit: After a couple more plays, and actually playing it with the correct rules, I bumped this to a 9. Awesome interaction, and a truly intense experience when played correctly. You are seriously on pins and needles when deciding how battles will be played out. Exciting stuff.

Interesting distillation of Dune. The graphic design is extremely busy to a detriment of setup and using the board. Dune graphics weren't awe inspiring, but they were clear. 

We played our two games incorrectly, first b/c we missed the errata sheet about collecting influence per unit. As a dune player I thought this was really odd change and should have realized it was wrong. After turn three, I did. We also thought that you didn't get influence for killing leaders and I read the sections in the rule book on leaders three times to confirm. Then after second game someone pointed out the rule was printed on weapons cards but nowhere in the rules! For shame FFG, these are game breaking errors/omissions.

With corrected economy, I am intrigued by the 8 round play time vs 15 for Dune. It's still a 3 hour game with any newer (or highly competitive) players and I think you'll want to use the (optional?) alliance strategy cards as the shortened play time really benefits the emporer/guild/fremen players (sorry I don't know/care about the TI faction names.) I might incorporate this change in a Dune game.

The non-limitation on number of factions in a location is also a major difference from Dune (where only two non-allied factions can be in a location.) I'm not sure yet if this is better. It certainly adds additional consideration to movement and battle.

There is no QH in Rex. As I've not seen the QH significantly impact a Dune game, it didn't seem to be missed in Rex.

There are some other subtle differences, How house atomics work, No Fedykyn, some special power changes in the name of streamlining (and balance?) but I think you could mix/match rules from Rex and Dune to find your own sweet spot.

Cosmic Encounter formalized and applied to a more traditional territorial-conflict game format. Combat is blind bidding and mutually destructive. Couldn't quite wrap my head around what to bid in combat for my first game, should improve with experience. I committed too much in battle early, and fell into a hole (too many casualties, couldn't recruit them back fast enough) despite winning them. I also got rid of my duplicate cards after winning so I could buy more; think I should have kept them, since buying more cards only gives more money to Lazax.

More straightforward for Hacan and Lazax since they don't need to worry about mining influence and can just go all-out in grabbing strongholds. Letnev needs to kill leaders to fund his coffers. Jol-Nar needs to parachute to the next influence drops. Sol needs to always go for influence thanks to Sol Offensive, and doesn't need influence to deploy and not as much to recruit. Xxcha doesn't need influence to deploy and needs to kill leaders.

First impression is a lot of painful randomness. Not just from cards destroying you where you stand (Sol Offensive), but also in the cards you bid for, and combat (pick A or B?). Optimistic that this will be mitigated by judicious preparation in future... Yes, you have to prepare for and embrace dramatic swings in fortune.

Some shoddy errors and testing gaps from FFG with this new edition of Dune, but the combat boards are great.

Lack of Dune setting is of course a disappointment, and hinders my immersion in the game. Would have been nicer to apply A Game of Thrones theme here than cookie-cutter TI3 though. The alliances and intrigue are so fully fleshed out, and the dynamic board with the need to detach yourself from your troops and holdings truly embodies the spirit of [i]valar morghulis[/i].

[hr]

Rex is a really unique and great game, especially if everybody is experienced. But the poor guy has several factors going against it in the PR department:

 - Dune snobs who played Dune first and forever hold it up as the standard, and bemoan the lack of Dune setting (the MICHAEL BARNES view). While it's a pity about the Dune theme, I actually like most of the rule changes in Rex, like revamped movement/deployment, 8 rounds instead of 18, streamlining etc.

 - I'm actually a defender of FFG rulebooks (they're not as bad as everybody thinks considering FFG games are longer and more complicated), but there's a special place in hell for the Rex rulebook. Poor organization, unclear description in some places, doesn't cover a few important/somewhat common cases, and really needs a manifest for each race/card. It's easy to blow the game if it's the first time for everybody involved.

 - With everybody at the table being new, this game will be loooooooong with lots of downtime, especially with unintuitive rule lookups.

 - It's easy to blame luck and the game when you get screwed (especially early), and there can be times when you look irrevocably screwed. It takes one who embraces dramatic swings of fortune and total game-changers ("Let the Lord of Chaos rule") to like this game, instead of one who blames luck at first opportunity. Like with Cosmic Encounter, there are creative and subtle ways for you to mitigate luck, but it's easy for newbies to write it off as the game's fault, not theirs. The combat system especially is really easy to screw up as a newbie in your first game. This is the Cosmic-Encounter-everybody-has-nukes-instead-of-toy-knives philosophy, where nuclear powers keep each other in check. Stumble and drop your ball and blow yourself up though, and you have to be man enough to suck it up and dig yourself out.

Get in a 4-6 player game (another benefit over Dune, 4-5 players actually plays well) with a couple experienced players to move the action along, however, and you'll get a board game experience unlike any other. High variance in play experience, so first play (especially if most of the table is new) might not be indicative.

Not a full 5 on design, because, well, the theme. I'm half a Dune snob (the Dune theme was perfect), and also wish it could've been ASoIaF if reskinned.

[u]Key Differences[/u]
 - More faction powers in Dune. Unfortunately, these are on the fiddly/powerful side: Atreides' Kwisatz Haderach, Harkonnen's Leader Capture, Guild's Maneuver Anytime. I favor keeping the additional Fremen powers. b{Advantage: Rex}b
 - Karama is too many abilities crammed onto a card. Better to have it streamlined into a Cosmic Zap or similarly pithy card (it's a Cosmic Zap with exceptions + faction-specific abilities + 2 generic abilities), which Rex did. b{Advantage: Rex}b
 - Maneuver/Shipping differences: Rex is more dynamic, while Dune = very restricted by whichever strongholds aren't still occupied, and the importance of movement discourages combat and losing the tokens that took a while to develop. b{Advantage: Rex}b
 - I welcome any structure on diplomacy/bribery besides free-for-all. The additional structure actually encourages people to make deals (instead of just relying on a person's word). OTOH, easily ported to Rex. r{Advantage: Dune}r
 - While leader-revivals in Dune make combat even scarier, I prefer leader death to mean something. r{Advantage: Dune}r
 - Winner takes all the spice from killed leaders in Dune while killing leaders gains influence in Rex. I favor the latter since the former results in more separation between winners and losers and makes combat scarier. b{Advantage: Rex}b
 - Increased revival rate in Rex makes combat less scary but also nerfs the Fremen. A wash since it's also needed to balance out Double Spice Blows without Advanced Combat, and get more combat into an 8-round game.
 - Treachery Deck in Dune encourages creativity with Truthtrance and combat with Worthless, while Strategy Deck in Rex provides flexibility with each card having 2 uses. r{Advantage: Dune}r

Overall, combat is less scary in Rex, which is welcome, because blind-bidding combat is already as scary as it can get. I'm concerned that combat in Dune is scary to the point of turtling.

Not feeling as hot about playing this right now because it doesn't really feel like I'm building a coherent epic tale. Just multiple rounds of rinse-repeat with little continuity in between. Reduced rating from 9 to 8.

Flashier than Dune, mechanics almost identical. The Arkham-style board is ok once you still down and actually play the game.

Asymmetrical powers, bidding for cards, alliances with combo powers that prevent backstabbing, nice battle system, battles in every round... Every game is a different experience, usually depending on number of players. Games with 6 players are the best BUT they can last for 4 hours and that is the main reason why I don't play it often. And some people really hate this game because it's not well balanced so you need to find right group for the best experience.

If you are looking for a huge strategic bad boi of a game, then look no further! 

REX has all the back stories you could ever desire, and I've not yet played a game under 3 hours.

Explaining to new players can take up to an hour. But once you've played a few times over the game play really kicks in for a huge strategic battler!

The one downside of the game is it really only works well with 5 or, more ideally, 6.  With 4 it's just OK, and with 3 it doesn't work well at all.

If you like games that require a lot of negotiation and diplomacy, this one is for you.  There is combat, but a lot of the combat comes in the form of trying to outguess your opponent.  The dial-combat system is very interesting, as you want to win by JUST enough, because any more and you end up losing more.

RATING: 9
This is a good game; really challenging. Its particular niche is an EXTREMELY competitive one for me, because there are other games that deliver similar feelings more efficiently, but Rex ends up looking pretty good.

I have a few bones to pick with the rules:

* Memory is important in this game, and so having a "no notes" rule really sucks. I actually don't like pen+paper in games, but I hate heavy memory elements even more. Allowing pen + paper is lesser of two evils IMO. But what would have been AWESOME, is if they included some sort of component that let you more quickly "mark down" what a player has on some sort of dry-erase thingy or something. Like Confusion:Espionage and Deception in the Cold War. At any rate, seems pretty bossy of FFG to try to rule on something that really should be up to individual groups (do you see many other games having no notes rules?)

* I'm really not sure about Xxxcha being able to predict Hacan's special victory for his win. Not really sure about Hacan Special victory condition period, because it is kinda unfun and easy to stall in this game as an alliacne I think. So maybe 6 player Xxcha stealing win is "necessary evil" for 6 player game, but that's just stupid. It's probably worst in 5 player game without Xxcha.

* Many of the rule changes from Dune seem kinda iffy, but on the other hand most changes are aimed at streamlining and speeding up the game, which I think is fine (8 rounds, no bribery, etc.) and makes Rex a different, more compact package than Dune that you can get in in half the time.

As far as gameplay goes, I'm convinced that this CAN be an awesome game, but its not equally awesome every time you play it; in fact sometimes it just falls sorta flat. Like many other classic games, it may take a few tries before you get that big "EUREKA!" game, or you might luck out and it happens on your first try.

It probably gets more consistent with a table full of experienced players, because the game is not very forgiving of large mistakes and because there is a lot of overhead/maintenance when guiding inexperienced players, and those things can slow down the pace of the game.


(4 Design + 5 Enjoyment): With note-taking allowed

[b]P.S.[/b] Betrayal cards are an absolutely idiotic idea. This game is won on small margins; you have no time to worry about some "post-game" effect that doesn't really feel like it even matters, and there is certainly no time for counter-play (you can't even willingly abandon an ally that you know has a betrayal card!). Backstab and intrigue IN the game is pretty cool; "overriding" someones win after the game is over is pointless. This is a long and strategic game, and should be above a little gag like that.

[hr]After playing Dune, I think the rules changes here were thoughtful, to create a almost the same, but different experience that is more fine tuned and eliminates some extra elements that may or may not be unnecessary. Not sure about the playtesting though, and worried that the balance may be problematic though in 5-6 player games with the Hacan SVC (which can be stolen by Xxcha), we'll see

RATING: 8
+ Awesome asymmetrical faction powers. I don’t mean one faction gets +1 attack and another faction gets +1 defense or some such. These factions are wildly different, and each faction gets several unique abilities. 

It seems almost game breaking when one faction can always have a ton of the fundamental resource of the game, when other factions will struggle with resources all game long. It seems game breaking when one faction can look ahead at all of the upcoming cards, or when only certain factions get powerful special victory conditions. Add to that the lop-sided alliances, king-making, meta-gaming... yet it all works somehow.

I wonder what would happen at the next meeting of the Committee of Modern Game Designers as they sit in their white smocks and devotedly go over their checklists line-by-line and thoroughly scrub the latest games clean of all common negatives when suddenly, they are given orders to design a game like Rex. I think their heads would explode.

Thank goodness the core of this game was designed in a time when designers were taking chances and not living in constant fear of being shamed for somehow letting a perceived negative slip through.

+ Risk vs. reward of battles and battle jockeying: Battle maneuvering in this game is just about as good as it gets. The decisions of where and when to move, deploy, and attack are amazingly intense. Really deadly battle resolution adds to this dynamic.

+ Decent playing time. Surprisingly, We are clocking in under two hours. I can’t imagine this game ever going over three hours, even in a slow group. That’s saying something considering some of the marathon sessions we had with Dune.

+ High quality production values. FFG has really made a beautiful quality update to Dune, except for...

- The uninspiring board. When you first see the art design of the board you will have no doubt that this is a FFG game. It’s as functional as any other abstract, point-to-point board, but I sure would have liked to play the game on a nice map of Mecatol Rex.

RATING: 7
A streamlined political exercise.  Easy to absorb and get into.   The mechanics are based on Dune, sort of.  I think FFG did a creditable job but I am disappointed in the graphic design.  The overly ornate, baroque flow-chart boards (Arkham Horror, Android, this game) all lack a sense of place.  As game boards they are very abstract when the theme of the games actually call for a more evocative design.  I think FFG is in a rut with this approach.  Meanwhile, Christian Petersen is living his dream of authorship by providing the back story fiction in the last pages of the Rex rulebook.  He is the Charles Ives of Boardgames.   Maybe, FFG and its entire product line is simply a means to provide a would-be author with a vehicle to publish his own fiction.

This is still like Dune, but with some streamlining (only 8 rounds, for example), a few rule changes (e.g., the weapon/shield explosion only happens if opposing players play them, and leaders survive), and a different (ugly) map. I strongly prefer the Dune theme and board, but the game play is pretty similar.

Good game, but the Dune theme/board sure are much more fun! Some of the changes probably are for the better, but I would love to go back and play Dune again!

RATING: 6
This is a pretty good game that just simply doesn't please me enough to want to play very often for the time investment required.  I've only played the game with 4 and by all accounts playing with the maximum 6 is the best way to play and something is lost with less players.

The design of this game is very very good.  Each player plays a different race and while they all play very very differently they all seem quite balanced against each other.  The game play itself offers the different races different bonuses at different times and truncates what you can do during a turn in order to make each decision very interesting and very important.  This is a very thinky, strategic game.  I also like the amount of negotiation and politics that has been injected into the system with the alliance mechanic.

What I don't like though is that while each game can play very different and the races are all balanced in a broad sense a game situation can definitely favor a race or allied team early and make the game stagnant.  In my one game I allied with a player who had a pretty clear advantage in a 4-player game. While the other two players allied out of necessity.  One of those two player's special power was to hold extra traitors and he had all the leaders of his companion.  By taking away one of his bonuses this made him and his team inherently weaker than the other and the rest of a very long game is just spent going through the motions.

I would play this occasionally because it is an epic game that works out the brain and can be a lot of fun for people who like strategic exercises.  Just with such a breadth of varied mechanics I can certainly see the occasion being plentiful where the same stagnation and early decided winner problem would arise.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Several changes from Dune make this a less interesting game - there is literally no way to bid "badly" when bidding on strategy, since there are no "useless" cards, and virtually every strategy card is pretty powerful by itself. Combat is somewhat less unpredictable, and hence less exciting. Fewer effects to replicate the danger of Sandworms that was everpresent in the original. Finally, the lack of a mechanism to determine a random start player every time (which Dune accomplished with the sandstorm mechanic) has been discarded. Two of us were told by two different sources that Fantasy Flight felt the original Dune would be "Too complex" for modern gamers. Can't say this is true, but it would explain a lot.

 Other differences have already been noted on BGG, but I figured I'd point out the bits that particularly stuck out for us.

Beyond that, the map is exceedingly busy, and quite convoluted. Lacks the clean, elegant look of any of the various Dune maps. In addition, some of the pieces, while up to FF's normal standard of "semi-over-production" are perhaps more pretty than practical.

If you can get the players and the time, this is one of the most fun games out there. It's highly interactive, with cooperation, negotiation, and the most tense combat system of any board game. The six wildly unique factions are what makes this game a classic, though! Rex's theme is not quite as strong as Dune's, but the mechanics are streamlined and improved, and it plays faster. There's still a lot of random BS - I find it hilarious, but it's not for everyone.

If you have the gaming group willing to invest in the average 3 hour time slot, you will very much enjoy this game. Love the theme, and the mechanics. Not to mention that the dreadnought fleet ship is really cool and scary to look out for.

The game recommends only about 3 minutes for the bidding phase for each card, I bought a nice metallic 3 minute timer to help keep the game concise and when a timing element is added, it makes bidding more interesting. You have to make a decision now :)

Great streamlined version of the classic Avalon Hill "Dune" game. The addition of Betrayal cards just pushes this game to an even higher status.

There is a slight disconnect in the theme (what exactly is Influence and why is it randomly appearing and being destroyed), but besides that the new setting fits perfectly.

I'd rate it a '9' if it wasn't for the different theme and, more importantly, the large learning curve. The game is very unforgiving, and people who want to "risk it all" can end up failing and being out of the game on the first turn. Of course, seasoned players know not to do this, but still it hurts the game.

Ultimately, this is a great successor to "Dune" and anyone who ever liked the original or was interested should definitely check this game out!

Successful reimplementation of the area influence/diplomacy first seen in the classic 'Dune'. Each player takes control of a separate faction, each of which possess different powers that brings an asymmetry to the game. Turns comprise of several different phases but the gist is that influence is placed into different areas on the board and players have to take control of these areas to obtain the influence. This influence can then be used to place more units onto the board and to replace units that have been defeated in battle. The most impressive aspect of the game in the combat system whereby players secretly select a number of units to commit to a battle and a leader who allows the play of an attack and defence cards. There is also the opportunity to match a traitor card to an opponent's leader thereby immediately winning the battle. Alliances can be formed and broken at certain points during the game and decisions surrounding this aspect of proceedings can have a huge bearing on the final outcome. The winner is the first player to have control of three strongholds at the end of the round or a total of four or five (depending on the number of participants) if alliances have been formed. This is a deep and tactical game featuring the potential for much in the way of surprises and back-stabbing, which is something that many games make a mess of, but not here.

I would have loved to get the original Dune instead. But this is more widely available and has some rule changes and streamlining done to keep play time and rules ambiguity low. 

I’m not a Dune or TI fan by any means, so the visuals and thematics aren’t grabbing for me. But the asymmetric flavor and the whole backstabby negotiations gameplay and such, and the fact that alliances have significant advantages and are binding in the game. I've recently played Rising Sun and about the only interesting mechanic was the combat resolution. I very much preferred Rex's gameplay based on the rules I've read, but Rising Sun does have a nice set of streamlined rules. And Rising Sun's crazy production quality definitely attracts onlookers and gets the players interested.

I wonder if I could just re-theme Rex and make my own custom copy. With colourful and whimsical art but the cutthroat game play.

remake of the old classic "Dune"
Sadly FFG wasn't able to get the licence for the Dune theme, so they had to use their own Twilight Imperium universe as theme.

+ interesting battle mechanic (wheel+leader+cards+traitors)
+ asymmetric player powers
+ great materials (The Dreadnought fleet miniature looks amazing!), also great production quality
- The bidding on blind cards seems odd, tedious and costs a lot of time. ?
- The people you can play this with are limited, and the game is better with 5-6 players.
- The theme is very involved with the mechanics which limits a bit (e.g. races to play with fewer players).
- difficult to play


Well, no sandwurms but a cool bombarding fleet.

It might not be clear from the start, but Rex is a negotiation game like "Cosmic Encounter".
It is quite tough to play and the game balance depends on everybody playing its faction right.


This game has a lot cool stuff going on, but:
- The battle system is interesting, but it's difficult and it seems a bit limiting (losing all units, losing more and more leaders if you can't protect them, ...).
- Having only one movement and only one deployment per turn is limiting. Max. 8 turns means max. 8 movements.
- The game is very luck-dependent: Getting good cards (weapons/shields, extra reinforcements) is key and can be very hard. Also, having the matching traitor card at the right time.
- Resources can become very tight for some of the factions, while others (Lazax, Hacan) get a lot for free.
- If you know, you keep thinking in terms of the Dune theme (Emperor gets the money, Fremen deploy for free, ...). The Dune theme worked better for the game and keeps shining through (which is good).


The components are great and high-quality production(!), but a few things should be improved:
- The board is confusing: Sectors and strongholds should be made clearer.
- Start player marker is too big.
- The fleet miniature is great but quite fragile. :(
- The insert doesn't leave enough space after punching out.

Rex: Final Days of an Empire is a game for gaming gourmets. Match contains lots of action perfectly mixed with politics and negotiations with opponents. Players can form alliances during the game, because they can share a common victory. But each of them can try to get a solo victory only for himself. When no one is able to win with K. O. until round eight by controlling enough stronghold locations, then some races may win by their specific conditions. All these options guarantee really dynamic and changing game. Second base part of Rex are battles. They contain not only comparation of strength of your secretly planned units, commanders and cards, but also a traitor options. These twists are another amazing element. Each player has someone in their midst, who is really working as an enemy spy and can therefore sabotage whole outcome of a battle. Yes Rex still remains quite easy regarding rules and game time usually will not overcome two hours. This is really nice value for such complex game. Little drawbacks in processing cannot spoil your experience or even impression from otherwise perfectly manufactured game. So if you like to intrigue and consider yourself as an advanced boardgamer, the Rex is simply a perfect choice and value for you.

Dune, in Twilight Imperium package, I'm a HUGE dune fan, and TI3 fan as well so this game just hits home for me, it's not for everyone and not everyone will like the weird ways it plays, but since it's devoid of real randomness, and more reliying on social gaming, it's darn near perfect, I could with for some more options for Social gameplay, that would top it - but it's not a problem, now if only FFG where allowed to get teh Dune license.

1 play, awesome game. (6 players), dont think id play with less than 6.

Quite a simple ruleset, but fantastic player interaction.  As usual great Fantasy Flight components.

This kind of game isnt for everyone (lots of backstabbing), but with the right group this is fantastic.

Our first game lasted 4 hours (with 6), this went to the full 8 turns.

Rex is a re-make and re-theme of a game that came out in the 70's, namely Dune. From what I've read, Fantasy Flight streamlined some rules and shortened the game. These are changes I can appreciate as Rex can clock in at around three hours when played through all eight rounds. The game can end earlier, and I suspect it will with experienced players, but a shortened play time seem appropriate for this game.

As for the game-play, it's rather solid. The designers seem to be taking a cue from Diplomacy in basing a straightforward (yet exciting) battle system around diplomatic jockeying. The interesting twist is that alliances are binding, and may only be re-negotiated when certain cards are drawn throughout the game. This limit is interesting because it both creates stability after alliances have been formed and puts pressure on alliances that have gone on for too long. As a result, Rex isn't as pure a negotiation game as Diplomacy, but still manages to remain true to its diplomatic core. This is a lessen that I wish Fantasy Flight would take to heart with some of its other big-box "wargames" instead of drowning them in rules and unnecessary, sometimes arbitrary thematic chrome.

I believe the same team that designed Dune also designed Cosmic Encounter, and, while I think Cosmic is the better game, Dune (aka Rex) does a good job of adding a devastating battle system to a host of variable player powers. I wish the Rex team had been able to keep the Dune license, as the re-theming loses some of its charm and simply doesn't map as well to the Twilight Imperium universe. Nonetheless, with a bit of imagination, Rex is Dune in my head anyway.

While the game plays well, I have to take issue with the graphic design of the board. At best, it's functional. From my previous comment:

I've played Rex twice now, and find the board merely functional. It gets the job done. Beyond that, it's a mess.

The color palette is almost exclusively brown. The brown on brown serves to obscure rather than highlight board elements. Obviously, the locations themselves have a bit of color, as do the sections on the right-hand side of the board, but they are all usually covered by cards or units.

The point-to-point movement design works, but seems completely arbitrary and divorced from any sense of geography. While playing, the locations and their relative positions give me no sense of place. I'm simply moving my units on a flowchart. For an abstract game, this would work. Likewise, many wargames use a point-to-point system, but do so in a way that makes the actual geography known. In Rex, by comparison, the city is just a mish-mash of fictional districts.

Everything is lavishly illustrated and decorated. I give Fantasy Flight credit for the artwork when looked at apart from the board. However, the complete package does not come together in a way that makes me really want to immerse myself in the fictional world. Again, for pure game-play, this is not a problem. But for a company that prides itself on thematic integration, the Rex board is a misfire.

First play had us, as I had guessed, really not understanding the capabilities of the other players. Lazax player stole it out from under us as two alliances went at it. 

Really like the game, but can't give a fair rating until I see more of the intricacies.

FFG did a good job of streamlining and clarifying many of the frustrating mechanics of Dune.  However the random chaos of this game makes it a disappointment for people that like to plan and build.  This is purely a tactical game of opportunity with huge swings of chance.

Therefore, this is not much better than Dune.  The cool theme is what carries this game, and makes me wish it could be more...

The combat system was interesting. The first time I played it, I actually played quite well. I made one fatal mistake that cost me to be in the running for the win in the final round. But even though I had a great experience with it, it didn't really call my attention. It's one I would [i]maybe[/i] play again if I had a lot of time and it was all that was being played. But otherwise, I'll probably find another table because it is particularly long.

I can see how people are a little bugged by the theme. It doesn't feel like it works as well as the original Dune.

We played a 3 player game, which is definitely not an ideal setting but it was a good learning game.

The rules were clear and fairly easy to understand. I know many games we are constantly looking to the rules make sure we are doing things correctly. I feel after a game of Rex, you can feel fairly confident in playing.

I guess I have 2 complaints, one, I don't often have 6 players so, I would love to see some factions that are better suited for 3-4 player games. And I hope hope hope there is an expansion of action cards. The cards were amazing and the artwork was beautiful, but I just felt like there weren't too many cards that made the bidding phase exciting. Not sure if that makes sense... Surely they could come up with some more action cards though, not just alternative weapons that have alternative defenses, but things that make things that can get you out of a tight situation. free recruitment drops, something that makes you receive more than 2 influence from a sector... I dont know. Just some thoughts. :)

I didn't particularly care for how racial abilities were balanced in this game nor for how random it can feel in the opening. The win conditions allow for very fast games while there remains the potential for extremely long games, which also is not an attractive feature. The game design leaves very little ability to plan ahead or to anticipate and respond to other players' strategies. I imagine most who enjoy this game do so because of the connection with Dune, which is funny given that all thematic elements related to Dune have been removed. I also have been led to understand that this game plays nothing at all like Twilight Emperium, so that stamp on the box is misleading as well. Overall I simply was not impressed.

Great negotiating / backstabbing game of area dominance and combat. The many phases of the game seem clunky on their own, but they flow together to create something that is intriguing and even downright exciting.

What's the difference between Rex and Dune? Rex plays a bit faster and smoother. The dust storm goes in the opposite direction. And after several demos and plays of Rex, it always either ends on turn three or turn eight, so keep that in mind, re-skinned Bene Gesserits.

Dune is my favorite board game. Rex is a better and cleaner design. Yes, it is better!!! It does not have the theme of Dune, but the game mechanics are great, streamlined, and very very effective. Kudos to the designer! Still Dune because of its theme stands on its own in a higher level than Rex. Also if you have updated Dune with the new clean streamlined cards, then Dune is the best of the best games.

Positive:  The game play was engaging and fun.  The system for playing troops was and bidding on strategy cards was balanced for cost and abilities.  The combat system was engaging and the way troops were lost was great at keeping one side from steamrollering the opponent.

This game is on the heavier side and took us 4+ hours to play. But we adored it. Rex has elements not found in lighter offerings: alliances, backstabbing and politics. While every faction is asymmetric with its own advantages, the game seemed to balance out well. The 6 pages of Twilight Imperium fiction at the end of the rule book was also something I don't see in other games.

I've only played it once and some people at the table weren't that into it, so it may not be a fair opinion.  The game does slog a bit though, again that may be because people weren't fully invested. The main thing that I found discouraging is that there wasn't nearly as much negotiation as I was expecting.  Alliances seemed obvious when they were beneficial, and when it was necessary to kick people, there was nothing to trade or really discuss.  Maybe I just need to play with more vested group.  I think it's definitely something that I could enjoy more.

A rewrap of Dune, but it isn't as good because the wrapper doesn't fit as well. In other words, the quirks that make the original great are seamless because they bring out the source material so well.  In this version they seem, well, quirky as if they were made up simply to vary game play.

Once we realized that we were only ever referring to the powers by their Dune analogs, we went back to playing Dune.

Not having played Dune, I don't have a frame of reference for how they compare, but I was surprised to find that the game had straightforward turns and not a whole heck of a lot to keep up with.  The battle dial mechanism is pretty neat, and the Dreadnaught is a neat element to keep the armies moving around the board.  Games with this kind of aggression aren't usually my fare, but I could see playing this one again, with more players.  The only thing I wouldn't want to include in the game is the Betrayal cards; that just seems like a game-winning interrupt card, and I've had my fill of games that use interrupt cards as a means for confrontation.

Fantasy Flight has done a respectable job of bringing the long out of print Dune back to life. Admittedly, not being able to actually use the Dune setting was a pretty large hurdle to getting that done. For the most part, I like the subtle changes made to the game's mechanisms. I'm not a huge fan of the Arkham Horror style board, but it's functional and not really a deal breaker. One thing that hasn't been changed is the focus on cheap alliance based wins. The game's asymmetrical sides lead to some pretty unfair (or so it seems) combos when certain factions share their powers. I'm not sure how to beat one of these alliances when it forms and thus far, it seems like every time an alliance happens that team wins in the next round or two with little disruption from the non-aligned.

Maybe it's just a game that demands to be played a hundred times before it is understood. Right now though, I'm still not getting it...

[i]This game has every chance for becoming a 10/10 in my book, I just have to play it some more to form a final opinion.[/i]

WOW! This is an amazing game for 6 players! Cooperation, negotiation, bidding, asymmetric abilities, betrayals, hidden objectives, - all the good stuff. The combat system is great! I had a total blast playing it, it's one of the most involving games in its genre.

I'd love to have it, but chances for it hitting the table are close to zero (you need 6 dedicated players), so it will probably fall into the "best game I'll never buy" category.

Many of my thoughts on Chaos in the Old World apply here as well. Here's a game (formerly Dune, of course) that is really intended for *exactly* 6 players, although it works pretty well with 5.

Again, it's a game where every player has a sort of role, responsible for a "piece of the puzzle" and to achieve the optimum experience, every player needs to be self-aware. It appears on the surface to be a Risk-like game about fighting dudes and conquering territories...and while that's certainly present, it's not the whole picture here. Sure, you can win by conquering so much of the board...but you can also win by just distracting your enemies long enough to keep them from foiling your true plan.

I love games with asymmetry and Rex/Dune is a shining example of this. Every player plays the game differently. Every player has a different goal. And if you don't think you can go it alone, you might be able to team-up. Although that usually forces the other (now nervous) players into a Cold War-esque race to secure the most advantageous partnerships.

It isn't a perfect game and isn't even my favorite asymmetrical game but when you can get 5-6 people to sit down with it for a few hours of war and betrayal, it just might leave you with an experience that lingers in your mind for hours afterward.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Based on my first game (and I never played Dune): Rex is a tough game with a quite a big quantity of details for my tastes. "In medias res" (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_medias_res) the flow of the game is good enough and the end arrived very fast, at the end of the third turn, so the length of the game was quite right for me this time. I dread to face a full 8 turns game.
Anyways, i liked it a lot, mostly for the strange mechanic of having so little to do for each turn, just a placement and a movement, but this is already enough to create a flowing situation that is not stagnating as i was anticipating.
Alliances and betrayals are at the core of the game and even if i am not good at this, i found it very enjoyable.
Maybe 5 players is not a good quantity because of the asymmetry 3 vs 2 players but still the game is fun.
Components are very good and the "dust storm" equivalent is truly exagerated.
I am quite sure that now that i know the game i will enjoy even more my next play and i will raise my rating.

In the wake of the dead emperor, the lion race and up to five other alien race struggle for control over the vast expanse of Mecatol City. There is some area control and combat which amounts to how much of your forces are you willing to lose for victory. Meanwhile, the Sol Warships are deliberately bombing the surface without prejudice. The card auctions are brutal because we don't know the cards well enough to value them. There is heavy negotiation and betrayal but I am certain our group is doing it for the sake of messing things up and not for any strategic advantage. We are yet to complete a game. Decent production quality and some interesting stuff going on but I won't get a chance to play enough times to find out if this is a good game.

Rules are not very complex, however gameplay leads to long stalemates and 10 minute gaps when you have to wait for others to finish their moves before you can start thinking about yours.

With 6, this game is incredible. I don't know if I would even consider it with less though... Before I actually played it, I wasn't sure if I would like it. However, our post game conversations revealed how much it had to offer. The game facilitated a great way to team up, backstab, manipulate, and play mind games through the use of alliance cards, hidden objectives, race powers, and betrayal cards. The game itself is mediocre for me, but the opportunities to create interesting dilemmas, twisted truths, and shaky alliances was super fun to me.

Mechanics: meh
Fun?: YES!

I can see this being a huge hit with a regular group of 6 players. This would be a go-to game for me if I had a regular group of 6.

The politics of this game are a lot of fun... all the races have great powers, and certain alliances seem ridiculously strong - though this usually means they're faced with equally ludicrous opposition.

My main complaint is that there's no positional battle to speak of. The only spaces anyone really cares about controlling are the five control points, plus wherever the spice... ahem, influence... has popped up on a given turn. I would have preferred if the mechanics led to more small skirmishes and the emphasis being shared between strategy and diplomacy, instead of only the latter.

Not too sure about this one yet. Asymmetry is always interesting but as expected unbalanced. The ally mechanics seem broken without some opportunity cost at least (Eclipse and its expansion manages this so much better). Will have to try it again.

Such an unforgiving game, probably one of the most strategic, but hard on new players, wish I could play it more often :-(

At the first game, we made a few mistakes, but I expected it. It was a very interesting and exciting game. I see the potential in this game. We all had immense fun. That's why I give it a 9.1 (for the first time I use partial ratings.)

Costed about 15000 HUF

For years, I tried to buy Dune unsuccessfully on Ebay and then waited for the reprint.  When I finally got to play a 6-player game, I was disappointed.  While you avoid spending hours on technology tracks or turtling like in many sci-fi games, there was a lot of downtime with 6 players.  I really like political games, but I did not find the politics in this game to be very strategic because you were limited on when you could form or break an alliance.  I did not find the TI theme added anything to the game.  The game was a bit too random for my tastes also. Given the choice, I would much rather play Galactic Destiny instead.

It gets better after each play, if only I could play it more it would probably rise even higher on my personal list of favourites.

Reading the reviews, I learned of the promise of grand strategy, non-binding deals, alliances, discussions, mind games and betrayals. And it delivered. Each subsequent game has made me enjoy the game even more, inciting more thought into how to play well/play each faction to their best.  

I agree with others here - this game definitely rewards repeated plays, and is best enjoyed by gamers who are competitive, love strategy, assymetric powers, shifting alliance, and betrayals both small (e.g. non-binding deals) and big (e.g. end game breaking of alliances and betrayal cards). The game shines when players really give it their all in terms of negotiations, non-binding deals, and bribes - the game is not quite as fun without people engaging in this table talk. 

If you have a group that likes these aspects and will engage in negotations/non-binding deals (i.e. separate from official alliances) and will play this regularly, and you have a winner! Works great 4 player too!

It's a very close reskin of the classic AH game, Dune.  Well worth your time to delve into.  Very deep, very good.

This just didn't happen for my game group.  It wasn't terrible but none of us were very excited about the game play so it got traded off.

Игра представляет собой слепой аукцион в разных формах и видах, приправленный небольшой толикой рэндома в виде карт. Это вариант Cosmic Encounter с некоторой степенью позиционирования войск игроков и прописанными альянсами, но отличий не очень много. 

Игра проще в 10 раз, чем кажется с виду. Уровень сложности - Каркассон + текст карт. 

В общем и целом, это такой пропахший нафталином, плесневелый олдскульный америтреш с приветом из 70-80-х годов, слегка причёсанный ребятами из FFG.

An intriguing game where 6 asymmetric powers vie for control of Mecatol Rex. It’s a game with a lot of secret information, and that sounded as a negative point when I first heard of the game since I like open information. But the game does a remarkable job of building a terrific game around that. It’s strong points is diplomacy, which is handled better than for example game of thrones.

Dune: +

Twilight Imperium universe: +

Fantasy Flight: + (component wise :))

Only tried it with 3 players, looking for an opportunity to try it with max number of players.

Edit: played with 6 players. We have stopped playing after 5 turns. It looks like that this game will stay in the closet for a long, long time.

Edit: sold!

This is a game I would like to play more often.  It's all too rare that I have the opportunity to play alliance/negotiation games.  I really enjoy the different elements to this game -- the Battle Dials, traitor cards, strategy cards, bombardment.

I am not really a fan of dungeon crawlers, though it felt good... when we eventually understood the rules. A lot of monsters availible make a lot of mess with recognizing them. And it's so easy to forget about monsters phase. (It started slowly, though if we played properly since the first turn, I guess the beginning would be more dynamic - we forgot to draw treasure cards after defeating a monster.)
There is nice variety of the characters. CATS!

Who would have thought that a colourful board game with little chibi heroes would be THAT exciting-?! It is fun, fast, a lot is going on on the board, and although learning to play is quickly done, the gameplay itself is even more entertaining, absorbing and colourful than you could have imagined. The dice/monsters really are quite a handful for the little heroes, so there is a serious challenge, and there is very little to almost no downtime. This mekes for happy gamers!
Playing Masmorra has brought our game club some of the most entertaining and satisfying game nights ever and has become one of our best-loved games.

I raise my rating from 4 to 7 because there are new rules to play in solo/coop mode. But i don't raise it more because i don't know the new rules.
Hope this new rules will be published in the kickstarter...

---------------------------------------------------------
Great production, fantastic minis (compatible with arcadia) and beautiful dice.
But game mechanics are not so great...
It is a competitive game with few palyers interactions, so it tends to be so much individual and a little boring.
It remembers me munchkin quest.
I think it could better be a coop game, but it's just my opinion.

I'll buy it for the minis to play arcadia.

This game needs the correct setting. If your group loves Imperial Assault or Descent, skip this & get Arcadia Quest. If you love those games, but know bringing one out at Christmas with Mom & Dad would be a painful experience for everyone, this may be the game for you. This is a gateway dungeon crawl, quick, light & enjoyable.

Nothing too deep or a theme that sucks you in, but I don't enjoy "deep" dungeon-crawlers anyway. I like the "take that" aspect of the game and its length is just right. Fun.

Recently received my KS version of this game. Tried a couple of coop games with my daughter to learn the rules a bit. 

Have played several times with my family. 4 players really seemed to drag, 3 players was much better. Possibly will improve as everyone gains a better feel for how the game works. 

Additional monsters through the KS exclusives and the expansion seem like they are really needed. I imagine the game would get old fairly quickly with the limited content of just the base game.

RATING: 6
For me, this game is just 'okay'. We liked it well enough with 2 players though we had issues with it- I thought those might be relieved by playing with more people, but at 3 at least, they were not. It's easy to get ahead if someone has a bad turn of luck, and there aren't really any catch up mechanisms. Playing with more than 2 players mean that on some cases retaliation on the part of the weakest player ends up just being king making instead.  The only way to score points outside of killing monsters is to get treasure cards and keep them until the end of the game- but it's unlikely you'll get them to begin with (there's only like, 5 in the entire loot deck) and they aren't worth many points at all. The ending is also simply abrupt, and both times we've played it has just felt off, like there should be something more to do. I prefer games where everyone can be involved the entire game and will have a solid chance of winning for most of the game at least- this one has so few ways to score points, and so few ways to catch up if there's an 'oopsie' that this doesn't seem to be the case. It felt like more advanced Munchkin in a way- a better and more involved game overall, but with the same flaws that keeps me from playing Munchkin. Whoever gets there first, get's dog piled if the other players can manage it, and whoever gets there second wins- which is just ultimately a let down.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Quite cute - although the style of minis doesn't really appeal to me and I'd rather the monsters had sculpts than just be an image on a die.

Gameplay is ok but I'm not convinced the characters are balanced some seem much much better. Also if you get a good start then it feels like you are uncatchable -you level up, you get more treasure so you can do it again. Haven't played the epic version maybe that is the real game here?

Mascara arrived and I have to say that I had a good time playing it. The treasure cards that you play against other people can be pretty brutal (I played one against myself in a learning game and it was basically insta-death) but that is the fun of the game. It actually plays pretty darn quickly. 

Someone on BGG had the idea of printing out little symbols to use as reminders of what was generated because it can actually be pretty easy to forget. I like that you have to dock the dice to make the decisions and it is actually very satisfying to find a way to dock them in all in a super efficient way so you can get a ton accomplished.

I do like that the game does not always end instantly, even though there is an XP game-end trigger. Everyone gets to finish the same number of turns so sometimes you can pull off something sneaky and steal the win.

Until I can get a good grasp on the game and memorize the monsters on the regular blue and orange dice I don't think I will be adding in the exclusive dice because it did actually get a little confusing knowing who was who and what happened before/during/after each fight.

Fun dungeon crawler with great production values, but committed a cardinal sin by overstaying its welcome. Like many games likely plays faster with repeated plays, but we were all experienced gamers and no one seemed particularly slow. It just really seemed to drag the last 45 minutes, and like all dice-based games the luck can sometimes be a downer. Still, I would definitely try it again and it wasn't bad.

I would not lie that the very reason I bought this game was due to the anime-like artwork. The miniatures are not the best but it is decent. I paint them in order to give them life in the game. Thematically, Masmorra is really a good game. Dwelling deeper in the dungeon with friends is fun. This game offers another competitive mode that might be harsh to play, but still, it's not something you could miss! This game is not complicated at all. I spent the time explaining the skills of each character rather than the rules to the new players. It disappoints me a lot when CMON do not release the other characters, some of them are KS exclusive and it limits the option to build the character in this kind of RPG game.

The more I play this game the more fun it gets and the more I want to play it.  Haven't even added the KS stuff yet (besides heroes), nor played cooperatively, and it's really starting to shine.

This game is best with a group that is familiar with the mechanics, as you have a better understanding of how to level up and attack opponents at just the right moment.  There is a fair amount of little fiddly rules and situations here and there to look up along the way for such a relatively straightforward game, but well worth the time.

Love the crossover with Arcadia Quest.  Top of the line production.

I have to say that CMoN seems to be what I wanted FFG to be early on. FFG branched towards the BGG design paradigm where there was a bit more emphasis on mechanics and interesting choices. For me what came about were games that were well designed, tops on the production scale, but ultimately had too much of a barrier to play. I do enjoy me a good well designed game, don't get me wrong, but I just don't have the luxury right now to get multiple plays in just to learn how to work and play within a design. So for me CMoN is a bit of fresh air in this era of stuffy designs. Masmorra is no different with an interesting take on a dungeon crawl hack and slash style game with some light rpg elements. Great design? Flawless design? Nope. But it is just fun and does what it does very well.

An inferior Dungeoneer. Dungeoneer offers up the same king of competitive dungeon crawl experience, but adds a lot more fun, variety and choices when it comes to the dungeon lord phase of players' turns.

A simple light dungeon crawl. I'm a bit conflicted with this one. I'm not a huge fan of the basic game mode - it cuts off right when things seem to be getting started. The epic game mode drags on forever and especially the last room is just chaos when people are fighting for the last points and the leading player trying to end the game alone. However, the cooperative game is pretty fun and I like so many mechanics in the game. I'm sure that this game could be so much better if the game modes were tweaked a bit. 

The minis are awesome and that's a big reason why I think the game is going to stay in my collection, so I'll probably going to be playing quite a bit more and trying to tweak it a bit myself. But I can't help but feel that there's some missed potential here.

Masmorra is a quick dungeon crawl game that uses dice for monsters instead of miniatures. It also comes with three modes of play: competitive basic (to 16 XP), competitive epic (beat a boss to complete the game and most XP wins), and cooperative. Regardless of whether you play competitive or cooperative mode, when you beat a monster, you gain a treasure card. In competitive mode, these cards either help you or directly hinder your opponent. In co-op mode, they either help you a lot or a friend a little. These cards can also be purchased through coins. This means you go through the treasure deck way too much for my liking and there feels like a lack of variety. I have never played the competitive mode for a few reasons:

a) I hear it's very munchkin-esque. Pick on the leader, take-that. Though, I hear it's quick when playing basic mode. I'm told epic mode is too long for what it is.

b) The characters aren't very well balanced. If you're playing coop, it's fine. If you're playing competitive, it gives them an advantage. This advantage can allow them to level-up quicker, which gives them more options. I guess the take-that cards help with potential runaway leaders, but it still doesn't sound very fun.

In co-op, it's similar to epic mode where you have to fight the boss. I also had problems with this mode. Basically it felt too long for what it was. Basically, you get way more XP than needed to reach your character's final level. It feels like it should have been shorter so that you don't go through all of the treasure cards and you may or may not reach max level. It wouldn't feel too long for what it was, in this way. I tried a variant to reduce the number of tiles needed to go through the dungeon, but ultimately decided to sell it and it's kickstarter bonuses.

Beyond everything I've said, I feel this game has a major lack of variety without the kickstarter bonuses. Overall, I wouldn't really bother with this one. Maybe a Season II will fix the this game, like what happened with Rum & Bones. Even if they do this, I won't be re-investing into the system.

A very fun, light, and fast dungeon crawl game that can be played as a competitive race to see who gets to a certain level first or a co-op battle to defeat the boss.  Cross compatibility with the Arcadia Quest franchise is an added bonus that allows for tons of character variety in both games (with an add on expansion pack).  The game itself is a blast and is easy to learn and plays quickly.  

My only complaints are that the hero models seem to be of lesser quality than those from Arcadia Quest.  They look ok once painted but are of noticeably lower detail when bare plastic.  Also the monsters are dice instead of models (which is ok as it adds to the randomness of dungeon encounters).  Several people (myself included) got blurry printed dice in the original Kickstarter though.  

Still one of my current favorite games to play though.

Coming in last place in a five player game is certainly nothing to brag about…but…you see I can brag…because I had a blast doing it! Masmorra: Dungeons of Arcadia is a dungeon crawler for 2 – 5 players and says that the play time runs about 20 – 45 mins…so I can safely say that it’s per person. Masmorra is almost a typical dungeon crawler with the exception of the treasure cards. The treasure cards are no treasures but a dual purpose deck of cards that let you either attack/defend yourself or screw over your fellow dungeon adventurers…and they are the BEST part of this game! I know that some people really dislike that mechanism but it happens so often that it’s a back and forth thing that’s just light hearted and for the most part they need to be stacked in order to really take a person out. There are two ways that players can interact with each other, one by playing the treasure cards and the other is that after a player completes their action phase they go into a dungeon master phase where they move and spawn monsters. The miniatures are your typical CMON high quality pieces but even that doesn’t compare to the take that mentality of the treasure cards! The score is tracked mainly as you venture through the dungeon doing various deeds such as fighting monsters, finding treasures, and disarming traps although there are a couple of the treasure cards that have victory points added at the end of the game. The scores for the most part stay close but occasionally as on my last play you run into a streak of bad dice rolling and forfeit a big chunk of VPs…and then there’s those good o’ treasure cards again! BAM! The player that was just on the cusp of winning gets hit with not one or two…but FIVE treasure cards and loses his lead! That is the genius thing about this game…the catch up mechanism is fantastic! Now you know that I can’t just sit here and sing praises of the all mighty CMON…nope…just can’t do it. The Bad, yep, you knew it was coming but luckily there not much bad at all. The components are top-notch but…the monster dice…yes you heard me right…dice, have very small numbers printed on them that indicate the monsters attack, defense, and vps…and I mean small…you veterans…bring your glasses! The game tiles are fine but can be a little bit difficult to see when you try and squeeze five players around the table. So, now on to the would I buy it…pppst…shaw! Pricing this at $52 usd is a fair price for a game with this much in the box and if you’re an owner of Archadia Quest you can buy a cross over pack that will let you use the miniatures on either game! So…grab your cash…ball it up…go down to the game store and throw your money at the clerk!

Light Dungeon Crawler that you can play both competitive or coop.  My first play Was a coop mission on mode "normal", but it was a cakewalk.   Easley got all level ups and barely taken any damage. Must try hard mode to have actually a challenge.
Artwork and icons on monster dice are very very small.

I was pleasantly surprised by Masmorra.  To me, it feels like a weird combination of Alien Frontiers and Wiz-War.  Each turn, you roll your dice and try to puzzle your way through combat.  Simultaneously, you are also trying to screw over your opponents.

RATING: 6
Setup takes a while, there's few more convoluted rules with odd exceptions than I expected, and people's turns often take longer than you might think, because players only find out what they can do at the beginning of their turn when they roll the dice, so they can't really figure out their turn while someone else is going. 

The core game seems like it's a nicely streamlined dungeon crawl once everyone gets the rhythm. Definitely need to try the alliance mode.

Later: Not terrible, but setup is too long and too many minor, counterintuitive rules for a game that's basically King of Tokyo with miniatures. 

Sold on eBay.

RATING: 2
Remake of Masmorra de dados reskinned with the arcadia quest theme. Unfortunately the new theme doesn't make the game itself any better aside from production quality.

Not enough interesting decisions to be anything more than a time killer as everything is quite reliant on dice rolls most of the time and suffers from the munchkin effect where you just gang up on the person who's about to win.

Not really a lot of planning you can do. Just roll the dice and hope it works out.

With the extra dice from the kickstarter tracking each monsters abilities can be a bit of a pain.

Different take on a dungeon crawler!

Expansions:

* PAINTED MINIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

 

* Everything from the KS except for the EXCLUSIVE MINIS (but it has all the exclusive heroes cards, so you can use the cards and some other mini with them) and the plastic chests\coins

* PROMO DICE SET IS INCLUDED

* EXTRA WHITE DICE ARE INCLUDED

* RETAIL MINIS ARE INCLUDED ( Valerie, Jay, Mika, Greybark, and Algus! )

* Adventurer's Set - Everything included except for the minis\Arcadia Crossover (bosses, tiles, all hero cards are included)

* Monster's dice set - COMPLETE but in spanish!!! - the only language dependency is the monsters cards.

RATING: 6.75
kickstarted - nov. 2016     w/arcadia quest crossover kit and extra treasure chests  

1 play with 2:  
Positives:  Components are stellar, which makes the game pleasing to play.  The gameplay is decently simple, with some minor rules snags here and there, but overall a fun dungeon crawler that doesn't overstay.  The leveling up of characters is neat and works well.  SO MANY characters to play with (KS exclusives and using crossover kit with AQ)  

Negatives:  It can be quite difficult to identify which monster is on a die by the drawing/picture (colors are similar in many cases).  The bosses being cardboard chits are somewhat disappointing in an otherwise really well-produced game.  

Overall, I'm pleased, but not smitten.  Need to play with more than 2 and see how it works out.

What a joke. I kickstarted this over a year ago. 
I confirmed the "first" pledge email when I received it and got a response from them saying they "got it" (almost a year ago).
They have long since taken my hundred dollars. But I still have no game. 
The game itself has been in stores for months now but I still don't have my copy.
I've emailed them multiple times. First they said they were moving warehouses. Now they said they are waiting for stock from China. Slow boat indeed.
I might actually give this game a better review if I ever actually get a copy of it. 
If my rating were based on the company, I would keep it at a 1. 
I am so done with CMON.

Edit: Finally got the game (months later) and I've played it 3 times. I want to like this. I just don't enjoy it. So little game here and so much random, repetitive, uninspired game-play.

This is really a fun game. The mechanics are simple but engaging. I love all of the monster dice (that has been a bone of contention with some reviewers).

Very happy with my first game. We played 4 players and it moved fairly quickly. And the game did what I hoped. Gave a bit of the Arcadia quest feel in a quicker and easier play. I thought I might not like the dice as enemies, but I worked fine. I expect this one will be played quite a bit.

RATING: 8
Light dungeon crawler where your actions are determined by dice rolls. A fair amount of Take That through the treasure cards but most are played at the beginning of a player's turn which just add to the puzzle. Overall fun game, but most likely better at low player counts to prevent gang up on the leader.

I’ve been playing and painting this with my six-year old daughter and she loves it. Not sure it would be a regular thing with my regular gaming group, but I’ve brought it out and it was fun. I’ve mostly played co-op, and find it a nice challenge. Minis are fun, base kickstarter components are fine, not amazing. I think it bills as a family dungeon crawl, and that’s what it is.

Easier to set up and quicker to play than it's big brother Arcadia Quest, Masmorra is a decent little dungeon crawling romp. The dice can be very unforgiving and random, but the fast pace and excellent components keep everyone engaged. It's more fun for kids and beginners than experienced gamers. It can drag on a bit at the end and the cooperative play is definitely better than competitive.

Good: 
The co-op provides a really light one shot dungeon romp. It will be something I pull out and play with non or light gamers and still have a fun time with.

Visuals and components are top notch. With the exception to the characters being slightly larger than the Arcadia Quest characters. 

Bad: 
Characters are extremely unbalanced. Picking a good character will almost guarantee a win in both PvP and co-op. 

PvP game seems to have a runaway leader problem, so if someone is lucky enough to slay a armload of critters early there isn't a way to catch up to them. I think this is partially due to exp earned for monsters isn't really representative of the difficulty of the monster.

The play length feels off. The PvP games can feel too short at times, but co-op begins to drag toward the end.

Co-op is too easy (may be due to imbalanced characters), we have been able to get to and complete the game with 5-8 turns to spare.

I like the Arcadia Quest minis and these minis are slightly larger so they don't seamlessly blend when using a mix of characters from the two games. 

Dice for monsters helps speed up gameplay but kills the reason to use minis. Minis, for me, are there to provide an aesthetically pleasing 3D battlefield. But having the combo of mini, cardboard, and dice makes it visually disjointed. Using cardboard standees would probably have been a better choice to tie the board aesthetics together. 

My biggest complaint? The character progression is too shallow. You level up to unlock the 4 traits on the character cards and while these do make completing battles/objectives easier it's not as satisfying as earning and finding equipment along the way. Part of the fun-factor of Arcadia Quest (and dungeon crawls in general) is to pick up permanent equipment that combos with your character abilities to help you overcome increasingly tougher enemies.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The perfect example of a light Dungeon Crawl game that is perfect for younger gamers. The production quality is top notch and it plays nice and quickly, however the dice monster mechanic may not be quite as innovative as the designers might have liked. Without a doubt the deciding factor for many gamers will be its ties to Arcadia Quest, as it provides cards to use these heroes in that game too.

Didn't know what to expect heading into this game, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. The monster dice really add a level of mystery to the tile placement of the dungeon. I also feel that reducing the monsters to dice rather than including monster miniatures serves to emphasize the cool factor of the character minis. The only thing that bothered me was the fact that somebody could ninja the victory by using Secret Quests at the end of the last round.

RATING: 8
It's basically wiz-war with clearer rules and more game modes. The competitive and co-op modes both work well and for the most part it doesn't outstay its welcome... may need to remove some more game tiles with more players. 

I was concerned that the dice enemies would feel too generic and same but I like the ones in the base set... the bigger question is if all the alternate enemies and heroes feel unique enough.

It's a solid game, just really tedious.  Lots of stuff going on.  When I asked my wife if we will ever play it again, she said "If we want to play something like that we will just play Arcadia Quest."  Agreed.  Set up time is about the same, AQ is easier to teach to new players and plays much smoother.  Good game, If you don't have AQ.

OK game.  Rules are a bit finicky.  Rule book looks beautiful, but the layout isn't the best and can be frustrating to refer back to.  Cards can be hard to read due to the stylized text, size and coloring.  Not really any interesting decisions to make during the game.  The only thing there is to do is explore and no matter which direction you go in the same tile is coming up next.  Next turn you explore again.  My 10 yo son seemed to enjoy our fist game, but when it was over he said "we should have played Mechs vs Minions instead".  Was definitely a must for me though if only for the extra Arcadia Quest content.

MASMORRA - enjoyable game for fans of Arcadia Quest. Nothing new and innovative though. Simple family style dungeon crawler using action dice to roll for actions. Monster miniatures are replaced with dice (kind of strange for a game made by a company known for miniatures) but dice are really well made. As a fan of AQ, I enjoyed this game with my young son. Similar art and characters to AQ. Can even get a crossover kit to swap characters from both games. Those who like AQ will be drawn to this as a continuation or more, expansion, of the world that AQ imagines. Others may want to try this out first.

I kickstarted this game so that I could get the new characters to play in Arcadia Quest, since Arcadia Quest is a fantastic game, and the characters from Masamorra are cross compatible. I hoped that this game wouldn't turn out to be garbage but if it was, that would have been ok with me. As a hedge, I made sure to get the extra addon stuff for the game regardless of if it was all cross compatible or not. If this game turned out to be anything, I didn't want to have to hunt down promos or unreleased expansions or god forbid exclusives. 

So this weekend, my group gave this game two plays. For play 1 we used the all vs all mode, and for play 2 we did the fully cooperative mode. The game also comes with a longer, all vs all epic mode, but we didn't give that a try. 

For those unfamiliar, this game is a dungeon crawler game, where the monsters are printed on dice. When you enter a room, you take monster dice corresponding to the symbols printed on the tile, roll them, and that determines the monster(s) you fight. The base game comes with only a few dice, but the KS had plenty of extra types to use. As a player, what you do is you roll your 6 action dice. Then you can keep whichever you like, and re-roll the rest once. Then you spend the dice as best you can to move around pick things up and punch monsters. The first player who gets to 16 experience points wins, or in the case of the co-op mode, once the players beat the final boss before player turn 21 ends then they all win.

In terms of decision points, and feel, the game is fine. With 4 players, it felt like the downtime between turns was just about as long as I'd ever want it to be. Maybe the downtime between turns sweet spot is 3 players? I really liked the smoothness of the monsters being dice. This got even better when one of the expansions added more types of monsters, and also bags to draw the dice from, so if you are a character who gets a benefit for fighting undead, you can't just chose the 5/6 undead sided die every time. As much as I love the crawlers with tons of minis, the economy of components here really felt fresh and exciting. The illustrations on the dice were maybe a little too detailed for the sake of clarity as to which monster was which, but I give the game huge props for having a full player aid available for each of the 5 players, in terms of what monster's abilities are.

Like pretty much every dungeon crawler ever, the rulebook isn't great. There are game mechanisms printed on the player aid that aren't included in the rulebook. The rulebook isn't organized particularly well, I had to flip back and forth and read and re-read passages to make sure we were getting things right. There are also some rules that feel very ambiguous. We did our best to interpret things, but I would be lying if I said I wasn't a little disappointed that even a simpler dungeon crawler can't manage a fully clear rulebook.

My dungeon crawlers consist of Level 7 [Omega Protocol], Myth, Arcadia Quest, Descent: Journeys in the Dark, Shadows of Brimstone: City of the Ancients and Krosmaster: Quest, and I do think Masmorra is not as good as any of those. That being said, Masmorra is flexible both in player count, and in gameplay style (being both co-op and all vs all), and it easily takes at least half the time to play as any of the games above. I'm also pleased at the ability to have a second game to use the Arcadia Quest character minis in. It's overall a good experience, and I think it's a keeper, even though I fully admit that I wouldn't have sought it out if not for the AQ tie in.

It has to goto 9/10. Why? We have played three games of this board game and we have really gotten to grips with the rules and the theme. Its so much more than just a roll and move dungeon crawl , its not that shallow as well. There are three game modes. The first is a must for learning to play. With an easy 16 xp final goal which can be achieved in a just a few turns.
The other games modes give you Epic and Alliance.  Epic is a take that version vs other players but with the common goal of completing the game with the most xp. The Alliance is a co-op version with all players combining ability, strategy and luck as a team to defeat Malaphayas at the end. Its brilliantly structured and its just perfect for kids. This is an absolute MUST for families who play together. GET IT!.update.The real problem with this game is setting up quickly. It looks like I'm going to have to make a custom box insert to replace the existing one. There's just not enough organisation and it takes too long to set up. I will think about this.

Rating after several solo and multiplayer games.
Pros 
- Good strategy in maximizing use of dice actions for each move
- Integrates heroes from AQ series that makes game feel like part of bigger universe
- Game lengths feel slightly short, to right on par. Never drags on too long.

Cons
- Exploring next room does not have an excitement to it.  All feel pretty generic.
- Main game treasures felt a bit underwhelming and were not used as often
- Death does not feel as consequential as it should be.

Overall I seem to enjoy the added modes better than the main game. I really like solo for a game I can set up and play with a couple of heroes at my own pace. Likewise I like the alliance treasure cards a lot better than the normal, and the evil cards add a fun twist.   The main game felt underwhelming as no-one was using the treasure cards, and then suddenly someone wins.  I think Epic at least gives it a finale.

Good game I will play on occasions, and easy to teach to new group.

Having played both normal and Alliance game, I have to admit that I enjoy far more the collaborative one. That said, I love the idea of dice as monsters, the way that, although not having to overthink every turn, the game can be pretty demanding in terms of how to manage your actions to make the best of them and, above all, how funnily frustrating can it get when you try to defeat some of the big dungeon dwellers. Definitively a keeper.

While I like the game, The retail version of the game is a bit bland, there are just the 5 base heroes and after a short while those 5 just end up being.. well bland, and a bit boring. The game play is fun and engaging and when playing with the Kickstarter version of the game with all the extra heroes it shines a lot more. This is unfortunately one of the sad truths when playing CMON games... either back their games on Kickstarter or forget about it in my opinion.

While I would prefer Minis for the monsters as they would be very cool, it is interesting to have the very nice heat set dice that randomly become the monsters on the board.  However, I almost think I'd rather have the cheat sheets they provide, and then roll a D6 and place the minis on the board.  Gameplay is fun, though, and some tough decisions, like I thought after Valerie died from the boss and then proceeded to send after me, I teleported and then sent 2 medium monsters after her, which she killed for mucho XP to win.

I wasn't sure how I would feel about the dice as monsters thing, but it works really well. The base game is lacking in variety, but the expansions (especially the AQ crossover pack) and/or KS exclusives make up for that. (Although it's unfortunate that their is only one alternate set of the minor/major monsters that is available at retail.) The multi player is fun, with two different game lengths available. Solo is fun as well, although I found it fairly easy (2 characters). An expansion or two more with more variety in monsters and tiles (ie Season Two) would likely bump this up to a nine.

I like this game quite a bit. My wife likes it a lot!

I backed this on KS, so I have a lot of variety in the monsters and the heroes... I feel though, that the thing that keeps this game from being great is the lack of variety in the dungeon tiles. The medium rooms are great! the problem is that there are 1-2 of them in a 2 player game. 

Small dungeon tiles are ok, but lack the variety that the rest of the game has. I love Dungeonquest, for its variety in the tiles. You never know whats coming up next.

The 3rd level room is a great experience though too! We played both sides and loved the finaly...

All in all, I am satisfied with the game, I am sure it will see the table many more times, but I am a little disappointed that the game wasn't all that it could be...

A fun and adorable dungeon crawl game. Very simple, and the standard competitive mode plays very quickly.

That said, it looks like the base game only has 4 characters and one kind of minor and major dice. I can imagine the game getting repetitive quickly with just those. The Kickstarter edition comes with a dozen more characters and several other dice types, which adds an almost mandatory amount of variety to the game.

First play, way better than I had hoped. Game is light but still gives you plenty to think about on your turns. Very suprising just how much you can do with those dice once you level up, you can have some really big turns with clever allocation of your dice.

RATING: 4
Beautiful components alone does not a good game make.  The gameplay whiffs on this one.  Too much randomness for my taste, and the "take that" element seems to result in mostly kingmaking.  This game is purely tactical, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it is so due to, again, pure randomness - your dice roll.  I took a chance on a dungeon-crawler, which really isn't in my wheelhouse, hoping that it may be something light and fun my kids and I could enjoy.  We'll definitely stick with Arcadia Quest.  If not for the ability to use these characters as crossovers, I'd let my copy of this game go.  But that's its saving grace, for me...at least I get more AQ characters.

I like this one, and I like that I can solo it. My son prefers Arcadia Quest, and since others like it too I play it more. But, Masmorra has exploration and no PvP. Arcadia Quest has an entirely known map (items are hidden, but not the paths to them) and PvP is a guaranteed (at least in my group). I also don't love the "last one to hit the big bad wins" rule in AQ.

Quick setup is a big plus. But to be honest I often find the gameplay a bit stale. Especially with 1 vs 1 there isn't that much interaction. And in spite of the re-rolls the winner is often very luck dependent. 

Can't step out of the shadow of AQ, in my opinion. Very happy with the crossover cards though, as several Masmorra heroes are good and enjoyable AQ heroes. Because of that, the KS + adventurer's pack still are a very good investment.

It's Munchkin 2.0. The theme, tone, goals, and principle elements are the same. It's much better than Munchkin, but that's not saying much. Very random, very boring at times, and everyone still needs to slam down everything they can on the person who's about to win.

A simple, dungeon diving game, with a lot of take-that, or potentially co-op fun.

Chibi minis are the main draw here. Monster minis from Arcadia Quest are replaced with chunky monster dice, which works overall as a mechanic to keep the spawns random. The dice docking mechanic (similar to Tiny Epic Galaxies) is also a fun way to plan out your turn, and definitely melds well with the level up abilities.

Played at BGG Con 2016

Arcadia Quest is already a pretty light dungeon crawler so when Masmorra was announced as an even lighter dungeon crawler, I was a little bit of a skeptic.  Still though, Arcadia Quest is one of my all-time favorite games and I love me some CMoN games so I gave it a try.

And it's good.  Mostly.

[b]Pacing Problems[/b]
Discalimer: I've only played the versus mode and the epic mode and while I had fun on both, the normal mode felt way too short and the epic mode felt way too long.

In the normal versus mode for Masmorra players are simply racing to get 15 experience.  It's not unusual for one player to immediately jump ahead and look like they're going to win right away, but generally that player then gets ganged up on and other players get to catch up.  Still though, someone reaches 15 experience, the game end state triggers, and you're often left with the feeling the game ending too quickly right when things were getting good.

On the other end, when we played Epic Mode, the game felt like it lasted way too long.  Instead of racing to 15 XP, in Epic you have to reach the third level of the dungeon to spawn the boss and then kill the boss to trigger the end state.  By the time we reached the third level, we were all already over the 21 XP limit on the tracker supplied [i](you start looping at that point)[/i] and we were all ready for it to be over.  At that point we all made a truce to stop messing with each other and just let the game end.

So normal mode ends just about when you feel like you're getting started and epic drags on for what feels like an eternity.  Don't get me wrong, the game is good, but these two things stuck out as my biggest negative.

[b]Character Balance Issues[/b]
Arcadia Quest has always had the good characters and the bad characters and that really isn't a problem when you have 40 characters to choose from.  Masmorra currently has five characters with one amazingly broken character, three decent characters, and one bad character.

First, there's Jay.  He's amazing.  Every one of his powers just work brilliantly together and he usually wins because he just keeps getting better.  Then there's Valerie and Greybark who are both just solid.  Valerie's power doesn't sound great until you see it in action and Greybark essentially has a seventh dice and eventually gets an eigth [i](which is pretty great)[/i].  Then there's Mika who isn't great, but being able to essentially auto disarm traps and open treasure is pretty useful.  None of those are really a bad choice.

Then there's Algus.

At first, I thought my playgroup was exagerrating about how bad he was and then I played him and actually looked at him.  Every one of his powers other characters do better and easier.  Remember how I said Greybark just gets an extra dice?  Algus has to pay money per turn if he wants that.  Oh, you want to do a big damage spike?  Pay two magic symbols where Mike just pays one.  If you chose to play Algus, you just goofed.

When you're playing one of the four not bad characters, the balance isn't a huge deal [i](unless someone has Jays engine going in full swing, I almost lapped someone in experience in the epic game because he was so ridiculous)[/i], but when you're playing Algus, just prepare for a lot of turns where you don't really do anything.

[b]Death Really Isn't a Consequence[/b]
We quickly discovered that dying really doesn't mean much.  It sets you back some number of XP depending on what row of experience you're on and you lose a treasure which you get a lot of.  We often found ourselves dying on purpose when we knew we wouldn't lose XP just to refill our health.  I would have liked some more consequences for dying.  It probably goes with the theme that this is a lighter adventure, but when dying usually helps you, that seems like a problem.

[b]The Dungeon Crawling[/b]
So onto the dungeon crawling!  Masmorra could not be any more straight forward, and that's not a bad thing.  This is a very simple experience, even by Arcadia Quest standards, and it just works really well.  Players get to move, explore, disarm traps, open chests, and fight monsters!  This is dungeon crawling at its core and Masmorra does a great job at this.  Even better, even though you're reminded of Arcadia Quest, this game feels like a completely different game so there are no worries about having to decide if Arcadia Quest or Masmorra is better.  They're both their own game.

[b]The Monsters[/b]
The monsters are a little disappointing in their simplicity and just being dice, but really, I'm fine with this.  The dice are of a really nice quality and the random nature of just what monster appears is fun.  It's a little sad that you still have to have a reference sheet nearby and everything doesn't live on the die itself, but that's understandable too.  The dice already have a lot going on in them and cramming more information would be too much.

One of the improvement Masmorra has over Arcadia Quest is that the monsters feel much more active in this one.  In Arcadia Quest, the monsters often felt really passive.  They really only messed with you if you messed with them.  In Masmorra,  they feel much more active since you're moving them all over the dungeon and having them chase down the heroes.

Our new dungeon had our heroes spread all over the place and each had a pack of monsters chasing after them and it was pretty great.

The game does come with a limited number of dice which worried me at first, but I quickly found when we had to take monsters off the board to respawn them, it generally wasn't a big deal.  Those were the ones left off in a random corner doing nothing and it felt great to respawn them right in the other players way.

[b]Not So Cut-throat[/b]
Arcadia Quest can be pretty brutally cut-throat, which isn't a bad thing but it isn't for every group.  There is still a lot of messing with your opponents in Masmorra through treasure cards, but since players can't directly attack each other, it leaves the main focus on killing the monsters and exploring the dungeon.  I love Arcadia Quest for being so free to mess with my opponents and making/breaking makeshift alliances, but this is a nice breath of fresh air.

[b]They Snuck a Gotcha Game in There...[/b]
I normally would not think I would want a gotcha game in my dungeon crawler, but with how light Masmorra is it works well.  During the crawl, you are going to collect A LOT of treasure cards that all have two choices-- something you play on your turn or something you play generally on other players turns.  A lot of these cards are gotcha cards like steal XP, steal treasures a player just drew, take away dice, remove abilities, and other nasty things.

These nasty little cards can completely turn your perfectly planned out turn on your head and manage to keep the game interesting.  Without these cards, the game would get stale quickly but these are what add the life to the game.

[b]Final Thoughts[/b]
Masmorra is a nice fit to the Arcadia Quest universe that can easily satisfy that dungeon crawling itch when you don't necessarily feel like dragging out and setting up a larger game like Arcadia Quest.  This game is definitely worth a try.

Kind of like King of Tokyo meets D&D.  It's pretty light but I find the dice allocation fun, and it's a quirky little take-that game that plays in under and hour.  It's nowhere near as enjoyable as Arcadia Quest, but it scratches a similar itch in much less time and setup.

Played once in Gencon '15.

Very fun game, part arcadia quest, part dungeon exploring ala betrayal in the haunted hill.

Adds in a lot of "Take that" elements from cards and enemy players controlling monster spawns.

Dicey of course, but everyone had fun when playing the prototype.

Light, fun dungeon romp.
+ Character variety (at least with KS exclusives)
+ Monster variety (again, KS exclusives)
+ Fun take that elements

- Replayability may be reliant on KS exclusives. I'm not sure I'd get it with only the 5 heroes. Expansion seems almost necessary for the retail copy.
- Rules are fairly simple, but the rule book could use an index. It feels like more pages than it really needs to be, so looking something up for clarification takes more time than necessary.

Quick dungeon crawl. Played only the cooperative variant. Leveling up the characters works nicely. Using dice as monsters as well, except special skills have to be referenced from a help sheet.

Really enjoyed the game. My daughter (10y) and my wife played it with me in co-op.  We had a few of the rules wrong, but overall still had fun.

A reskin of another game into the Arcadia Quest universe. It's simpler than Arcadia Quest and takes less time, but at the same time it sometimes seems more complex and I've found it has more rule ambiguities which can often lead to some confusion.

Epic Game seems a little to long and the normal game is way to short...but its a fun and light game  i think Arcadia Quest is a little bit better and more fun.

Another "Going into a dungeon and getting as much loot as possible". Yawn. I am so tired of this theme. The game is also quite boring. It's not a horrible game but really a meh experience.

The Good:
-Components
-Variety
-I like the dice action system

The Bad:
-I hated the Take That. Felt out of place
-The game takes way to long for what it is
-It lacks choices that has any real impact
-Lack of excitement. There are no "Oh my god, the turn I just had" feeling

Rating Comments:

Fun little dungeon delve with action-dice selection in the vein of King of Tokyo or Tiny Epic Galaxies. Characters are unique and inter-compatible with Arcadia Quest.

KS edition. A very nice and fun light dungeon explorer with a good touch of "take that" action and great production. I lowered my rating from 9 to 8 because of the following:
a) the Retail version lacks monster diversity, this can be mitigated by getting the Monsters Dice Set,
b) the best tiles of the game are the medium rooms and you can access them thru the rune tiles which only 4 are available per game.

Wish the graphics were a bit more clear on the dice.  Otherwise great for co-op.

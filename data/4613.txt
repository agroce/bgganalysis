18XX game kit that produces a very playable game.  Lonnie&#039;s stock market is quite different from the standard 18xx game and his tunnels can really change the tracklaying feel.  I have played several times and no two games have been similar.

I love most anything 18xx.  I think its great to see the innovations that people can come up with that customize the system to a particular geographic area.  Austria was a wonderful choice and the mountain railroads there offer an excellent adaptation for this system.

Three cheers for Lonny!

Adds some extra chrome on the 18xx system; the focus here is on tile-laying - difficult tile-laying.  The tunnels and the local board in particular make for great mechanics.  With the game playing in ~5 hours for new players, this is a wonderful addition, particularly given the Austrian interest around me!

I love those tunnels!  They look so cool.

As an 18xx title I love this game.  The special rules in this one, although somewhat fiddly on the surface were easy in actual play.

I think this is one of those games similar to 1854 where its a bit too easy to get money into your companies. A lot of the tension is removed that way....as you're unlikely to have trouble getting a train.  Its just a matter of which one.  The tension comes from the route battles primarily.

I found the small side-board for the 2-hex area a really interesting idea. I'd like to play more to see how that really develops differently in multiple games.

Still have dual thoughts on this one. I find the market fascinating, but there's still something weird that doesn't seem to work.

Holy crap the rules are poorly written. So. Very. Poorly.

Quirky but innovative.  What's not to like?---a hexagonal stock market, clear plastic tunnel tiles, a mini-map upon which 6 local companies can gambol undisturbed by the game going on around them (mostly, or at least until Phase 5.)  It had a lot of interesting decisions for me as a first-time player.  I'm not sure how it will hold up to repeated play, and I'm not aiming to play it several times in a year, but I certainly would like to play it again.

The new edition is streamlined, but I'm not sure I like streamlined in this case.  The wonderful baroque green city tiles around Wien have been removed in the new edition.

This is an interesting 18XX variant that has two major features: 1) Minor companies start out on a "mini board", where track can be laid; and 2) Tunneling allows track to be built under existing track.

In 1854, the concept of minor companies from 1835 is expanded, so that they can engage in track laying inside a smaller board, which represents a very small region of East-Central Austria. The track laying is sort of a meta-game in of itself, as it determines the income for each minor company. These minors eventually go away and are replaced by several major companies that then begin to branch outward from the small region.

There is a lot going on here. I wouldn't mind playing this again, but it is recommended putting several hours more beyond what you think you'll need to play this miniature monster of a game.

There's nothing about an 18xx game that provides me any form of enjoyment, and so the prospect of spending another three hours(at minimum) per session at least half a dozen more times just to progress past the conscious incompetence stage is unappealing. The strategies and tactics of this genre will forever remain opaque to me.

A nice variation on the 18xx theme. I really enjoy the tunnels and the fact that the privates start on a small different board and get incorporated into the main game.
I do not like the two higher valued privates as they are overpriced and not a sure thing that you end up owning the company. Because the first person with a change to buy can get 40% of the company and float it. and that is a very valuable strategy. Also the fact that some small starting corporations are much better than others makes that this game is only for the hard core 18xx player. But for those players it brings a nice variation on the theme. 
The only other small problem I have is that the game seems to be a lit more linear than I like because of the way the map is laid out.

[b][thing=4613][/thing][/b] is another [b][family=19][/family][/b].  And it's a bit of a tracklayer's nightmare.  Mountainous Austria is expensive to build over and full of choke points.  Medium double-dit towns became dead ends when competing companies tokened them off.  It is also has a game within a game with a national map for national railways and a local map for local companies.  The latter are really good early, but then become less of a factor towards the end of the game.

I like this game more than Lonny Orgler's other game, 1837. I understand that 1837 will be revised and re-released later this year.

RATING: 8.2
Intense game.  Lots to worry about here... keeping companies running, public company issues, train rushes, and intense competition for space and in the market.  This is a level of evolution above most 18xx games because the tunnels remake the board.  Excellent with 4 players.  I think any more than that might be brutal but I haven't tried it.  It would definitely work with 3 as well.

Map seems a bit unbalanced, and the start-of-the-game crappy operating runs are just frustrating. The hexagonal stock-market movements and share splittings are interesting, though.

18xx in my home country, designed by one of my friends. Of course, it's a "10". :meeple:
The board is very brutal, narrow and expensive, but with the transparent tunnel tiles, manageable. A very different 18xx experience - very recommended.

We only have a partial game under our belts.  I think the stock upgrades are a little over-fiddly (a dozen or more unique tiles is a lot to try to keep track up with!)  Still, I enjoyed the game, and I'd look forward to trying again.  I'm afraid it's going to be too long and too fiddly for all but the most die-hard 18xx fan.

The game is all about building great trains rather than stock shenanigans. It seems that the main competition in this game is getting specific track more than anything else. The mini-map gobbles up all the yellow track options for the big map, so everyone makes inefficient builds, and bizarre gamey choices. Sometimes the game can stall because of the lack of proper tiles for the big board. There is quite a bit to it, but I find it all rather fun.

Ordered from Deep Thought Games.  7/20 behind 313 games.  Update:  1/20 behind 147 games.  Update: it arrived 2/24, can't wait to play it!  Two plays now.  This is a fantastic game.  I really love the fact that there are meaningful tile laying choices all the way through the end of the game.

Solid. Lots of chrome (options, mini-map, 3 types of comapnies).  Only problem after a few plays:  Major Local companies are too rich in the endgame -- may be that we need to make more effective use of our tokens.  Otherwise one of the best 18xx games going.

I recently got this game before Gencon 09' and didn't actually get to play it while I was down there but did play it up here in Anchorage three time now.

WOW!  It can be a nasty game. Still fun though but can be nasty.

Slow start where most of the play is in the small two "hex" map board. Interesting mechanics and will play again just it can be nasty.  It is also a longer game to play.

This is the Orgler version (apparently), and not the Deep Thought one.  It looks pretty good, though; the only bit that I'm worried about is the tiddly-wink tokens.

Different types of companies and trains. Very expensive track builds, but companies can get more money later in the game.

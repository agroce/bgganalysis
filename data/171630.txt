What a great gateway/filler game! My group plays everything from Love Letter to Caverna and this fit right in. Fun, and easy to teach and learn. Major "take that" elements but each game ends quickly so lots of opportunity to get some revenge.

I can't tell from this if anything is changed, or if this is just a reprint.  The way it reads, there may be more rooms conferring some kind of benefit to characters than previously.  

The only flaw I can name with my earlier edition is that the board is so confounded small that we've literally bumped heads in play while trying to see it.  If they make the board half again the size, I'll contemplate buying the new edition, but I should probably just get the thing enlarged somewhere before somebody gets a concussion.

For me, this was very 'meh'. I can't say I particularly enjoy 'take that' games, and this game is very that. Lots of stealing from people, or destroying their rooms, or keeping them from leaving... The first time we played it with just two it seemed essentially unplayable. The second game of it with 5 worked better for sure, with no easy way to catch up if someone gets really far ahead. Before we knew it, one played had already amassed the ten coins to win- all the other players had zero for the most part, maybe one. All in all, while I'd be willing to play the game again, it wasn't really great, either. Still nice minifigures, and the components are all really nice and high quality. But the game itself is pretty 'meh'.

Same old Drakon. Lots of "take that" while you procedurally generate a dungeon in a quest for gold.  Your friends will hate it, unless they also hate you.  In that case they will love screwing you out of your gold.  The molded characters and dragon are an improvement.

Very simple. Teach the rules in 5 minutes and get playing in 6. Everyone picks it up really quick. Typical FFG polish. I like Tim Jolly as a designer. Loved Wiz-War so this was an auto buy. 

I hate carcasonne but this is a tile laying game with a twist I can really get behind. The minis are a nice touch too.

Tile-laying exploration game where you screw everyone else over and sometimes yourself, though that rarely happens because someone else has most likely screwed you over. Almost no sense of strategy required because whatever you're trying to do will most likely be impeded by the time you get to it. Good fun with shit talking and drinks, games can go a bit longer than I want but still worth keeping regardless.

A fun and light tile laying game. It's easy to learn and easy to play. I highly recommend it.

The game drags with too many players though. I don't recommend playing with more than 4 players.

This game confirms my opinion about the small format games from edge.
Even with simple rules, and little materiel, the game will spread all over the table, will last much longer than anounced on the box and all this for very little fun.

I refer especially to "zombies !!!". This game is supposed to last 30mn but lasts at least 1h30 ! I always though (with some sarcasm) that the 30mn anounced stands for the fun time of the game... then it still remains 1h to play.

Same thing here.
Rules are straighforward. Every player only has one action by turn : lay a tile or move to an adjacent one. We assumed we would have the time for conflict or to build a winning strategy but the too few actions available don't allow to really explore any of these options. Thus, in the chaos of moving, We hope to find a loop in the dungeon full of gold coins...
Coins which are the final goal. The first to have 10 gold wins. But coins have a variable value, between 1 and 3 gold. So, you can easily win with less coins than someone if you are lucky ! This is much disappointing for the others and very little satisfying for yourself !


In French :
Ce jeu confirme chez moi un avis particulier sur les jeux petits formats EDGE.
Sous couverts d'une règle très simple, et de peu de matériel, le jeu va prendre toute la surface de la table, avoir un temps de jeu supérieur à celui indiqué sur la boite et ce pour peu de fun au final

Je pense en particulier à "zombies !!!". Le jeu est indiqué durer 30 mn et dure 3 fois plus longtemps.
je me suis toujours dit (avec un peu de cynisme je le reconnais) que les 30 minutes indiquées représentent le temps pendant lequel le jeu reste drôle... Puis il reste une heure de jeu usante

ici même chose.
Les règles sont simples. Chaque joueur a une action par tour : poser une tuile ou se déplacer d'une tuile.
on croit qu'on aura le temps de pourrir les autres ou bien de les prendre de vitesse mais le trop peu d'actions disponibles ne nous permet pas de jouer vraiment sur ce terrain là, alors dans le chaos des déplacement, on espère tombé sur une boucle du donjon pleine de pièces...
pièces qui sont l'objectif du jeu. Le premier à totaliser 10 or a gagné... Or les pièces ayant une valeur aléatoires, on peut facilement gagner avec moins de pièces que les autres... Ce qui est bien décourageant pour les autres et peu gratifiant pour soi.

RATING: 7
An excellent, simple filler in the thematic vein of Wiz-War, melding Tsuro style tile-laying with special tile effects that chain together into a malleable programmed movement engine. The game rewards cunning plans and those who disrupt those plans in equal measure, creating Rube Goldberg disasters that are often entertaining.

Beer-and-pretzels filler. Quick, chaotic, maybe too many different actions to choose from. Good components, although sometimes the minis get in the way of the door and arrows, so it becomes harder to see valid paths. Mean and take-that yes, but because of the short play time that does not really matter - which also is a problem. Theme and gameplay remind me of Argo, which is more strategic/abstract, more meaningful, and more fun.

This is a fun game and with more players this becomes a bit chaotic and even more fun. There's luck, chaos and tactics included and the combination seems to work well. You get a good dungeony feel and if all players are willing to choose their own paths this could even get quite hard. Good improvement to 3rd ed is the steal tile chamber which can't break the team game anymore. Stupid changes on the other hand are needlessly bigger box and useless insert.

A quick dungeon delver that cares a great deal about creating traps for the other players with tile placement.  Tom Jolly excels at these light fantasy romps, and this FFG edition looks beautiful while playing simply.  We went from box in shrink wrap to first round of play in less than five minutes.  A real winner.

This is a really enjoyable "take that" style game that, while light, in a group of serious gamers can turn into a defensive chess match.  The larger the group playing, the harder and more chaotic the board becomes.  Game comes with some small plastic miniatures, which was a welcome surprise.  This is a great filler game between deeper ruled titles.

A fun party game when you have either a short amount of time, or people who don't like games with any complexity.

Been searching for a game as good ever since. Smooth, almost perfect, scales very well, quick to play (played many lunch time sessions). Glad to see the Drakon gets an extra tile in this edition (the third edition only had 3), so a slight improvement there! The wind tiles still confuse new players. The only reason I might rate this less than a 10 is that my wife is turned off by fantasy themes.

A simple dungeon crawl game to play in-between longer, more complex games. I recommend it for bringing new players into the hobby and for a quick casual game with a few friends.  I think young players might enjoy it most--a nice little gateway game.

This is a dungeon run/building game.  Players, try to navigate a dungeon and obtain 10 gold worth of coin.  Many of the room have some special ability that trigger when you enter.  The doors to move to the next room are all one-way.  Each player also has a different special ability.  Some are movement related and some are related to getting money faster.  Each turn, a player may choose to either add a room to the dungeon or move into an adjacent room and trigger its special effect.  

The game plays 2-6 players.  The game length can vary greatly due to how the dungeon is built and how well players can prevent other players from obtaining enough gold.  It can take as fast as 15 minutes or run close to an hour.

Lesson learned! When this game first came out I added it to an order to help hit the free shipping threshold. I usually research my games but I decided to try something new, buying this game without knowing anything about it. It's the fourth edition and it's from one of my favorite companies, FFG, so how bad could it be?

It's really bad. You randomly move around a random dungeon and randomly try to get gold, which is randomly distributed among gold tokens that can be randomly stolen from you. It's not fun and everybody I played with hated it.

It has asymmetrical characters, which I usually love, but each character is only unique in that they have a once-per-game ability they can use. That's the worst type of asymmetry. I want ongoing abilities that make each character feel unique, not some wimpy one-time ability. And the powers themselves are incredibly boring because it's usually just something along the lines of "move an extra space."

Really bad game, no idea how it has lasted through so many editions. Just let it die.

Sold.

Surprisingly simple yet fun 'take that' game. Lacks the elegance of Tsuro - and the theme is more niche. However, Tsuro can feel a touch light while Drakon adds a greater feeling of control.

Super fun tile-based dungeon crawl. Move into a square, flip the tile, place monsters, fight them and loot them or face challenges for treasure. Try to get more monster tokens and treasure than your friends but don't die! Honestly, I feel like this mechanic is kind of old, and I'm surprised that it's NOT more popular, or that it's fallen out of popularity. Remember Zombies!? I STILL love that game....

Fun game that's fairly simple to learn. The game can drag on if one player knows they won't win and just plays to sabotage.

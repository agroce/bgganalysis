1 play / 2 players

LIKE: Brainburner trying to figure out how your past actions can  help your future ones. Limited resources can really cause your plans to go haywire, and you need to scramble to find a new card to help.
DISLIKE: Seemed too open for two players. No random setup. For this type of game I think more players would be better. Explaining the rules seemed a bit convoluted at first, but that may have been just us. The "Ad!" tokens did not make any sense to me.

OVERALL: Interesting concept, but the game felt a little light. With two players and no random elements, it felt a bit harsh with head-to-head actions that could interfere with someone else.

Wonderful art and an interesting design. The game is almost 100% planning. If you haven't figured out what path you want to take pretty early on, you're out of it. Not really my thing, since it significantly punishes a single bad move. That leaves you with few choices in the game...just execute your plan and work around roadblocks.

Interesting mechanic, but devolves rapidly into Analysis Paralysis, lengthening player's turns and diminishing the fun.  Looking forward to trying out solo mode.

May be too affected by turn order. Also, "claiming" cards feels more like an excercise in spite than strategy, as the claimer and their competitor may both lose out more often than not.

Puzzley brain burner, and a lesson in constraints.  You really have to be able to see the future to perform well in this game.  The final round gets a little frustrating as two-thirds of the cards you'll play have already been decided, including the order in which they'll be played.  If you spend your three 'new' cards early in the turn then the rest of that round becomes very mechanical...play the next card.  Then the next.  Then the next.  Still, there's some optimization you can do during that.  But you're soooo constrained.  Love the theme, love the idea, not yet sure that I love the implementation.

Initial Impressions:
----------------------
I haven't been a fan of anything Scott Almes has done, and I think this is my least favorite of the ones I have played.  The graphic design is horrible on both the scoring track & the cards (too tiny too see the requirements).  While I think Scott tried to come up with something clever with not being able to change the order of your cards from previous rounds, it ends up making the game really uninteresting since the only decisions is on what 3 cards you will "add on" per round.  This one will be long forgotten shortly.

The idea behid the game is great, but the execution (unfortunately) is not. One of the things that piqued me was visiting other eras. However, and I do not understand the decision,  TINY art comes in the way of truly immersing in the game and having fun.

Sigh... Another Kickstarter game that fits the mold perfectly. The concept of this game is neat. It takes the theme of time travel and fits it to mechanics that actually fit the theme. Basically your going through the same day three times. During each day you must purchase 4 cards and play any cards you bought from prior days in the same order they were played when purchased... Sounds neat, but it just turns into a hot mess. Its so bad that this is as much explanation as your going to get.

RATING: 5
While I think Loop Inc is well-designed and has clever ideas, it's just something that I personally enjoyed.

The game is essentially a puzzle where you look at it to start the game, and you map out a long route of how you can progress through achieving a bunch of goals. You find a pattern of matching symbols on the various travel cards, and figure out the best route for getting all those matching symbols on your time travel machines so you can visit as many as possible.

The thing I'm not a fan of is that you really have to form this long plan, remember the long sequence of steps to achieve it, but then if one thing goes wrong (other players often unintentionally get in the way while executing their own plans), it can screw up the whole thing. Since you only get 18 actions the entire game, having to sidetrack is pretty bad.

Now, there are some cool ideas here. In the first round, you get to take three actions, which are recorded bu virtue of cards you pick up corresponding to each action. In the second round, those cards go into your hand in the same order as you just did them. Now, in round two, you must re-use all three of those cards in that order, while also adding three new actions, interspersed among those original three actions you took however you'd like. Now, in round 3, you'll have all 6 of those pre-programmed actions that you must due in that order while plugging in another 3 somewhere.  So, the planning method is actually quite neat and tricky, as in later rounds, you must reuse everything you previously did without changing the order in which you did them.

All in all, it just still felt like a puzzle I didn't much enjoy, despite it being a clever design that will clearly please some people.

Not my cup of tea sadly. Love the theme and art but the gameplay itself is too much punishing (with many negative points). Most of the time, I hope to be able to find an 'escape route' but it is really hard (or probably impossible) to get. I also feel the score board is also hard to track.

Sorry to be a downer.  Got it on Kickstarter.  The idea is cool, the artwork is fun, something is off on the mechanics.  Too many things going on at the same time.  

For example, it feels like reaching your time travel is hard enough.  Throwing in the limited resources from other players really bonks you.  And then there's no recovery.  Instead of building excitement, it just makes you frustrated.   

Maybe a few more plays would work out the kinks.  Unfortunately, there's too many other good game out there to try or replay before I'd invest any more time in this one.

Update:  Donated to my kids' school garage sale.

Equip a time machine to score points, then you do it all over again with two machines (you moved back in time and now there's two) and finally three.

An interesting idea for a game, but I didn't really find the puzzle that it attempts to create all that interesting. Maybe with two players it was all just too easy to get done what you wanted to get done? I just didn't struggle one bit to meet my objectives. Plus, the whole thing just feels a bit "wonky" with how it plays out. But still: a nice idea for a game and not broken, per se, but just doesn't create the thrill I was hoping for.

INITIAL IMPRESSION

The game has some interesting card play setup where the things you do in previous rounds affects your current and future rounds.

It can be a bit difficult to figure out what to do and other people can really mess up you plans by taking equipment or going on trips you wanted to that round. Not to mention the future consequences in later rounds.

The first round plays itself almost and the last round is a mad scrabble to make things work.

If you like tactical challenges and optimization, this game will be interesting for a few plays but otherwise you might not enjoy the struggles in this one.

RATING: 5
Kickstarter edition (includes all stretch goals). 

Loop, Inc. is multiplayer solitaire + programming/coding with a time-travel theme. For me, these mechanics are not two great tastes that taste great together, and the game felt like a test I didn't feel like taking for a grade in a class I didn't care about passing.

The time travel theme is laid over an abstract game, like most time travel games. To its credit Loop, Inc. visually depicts the idea of time travel better than most, in a "Doc Brown writing on the blackboard in "Back to the Future 2" kind of way.

What really shines in this game (and gets 10 stars from me) is the whimsical, Jetsons-style retro artwork by Kwanchai Moriya. 

As an aside, the rules booklet for this game was written just opaquely and fiddly enough to further damper our enthusiasm to finally try teaching/playing it. They actually read like a technical writer unaccustomed to writing for non-technical audiences. Games about alternate timelines with an additional learning curve to wrap one's mind around the time travel mechanics shouldn't create a vacuum of clarity in the rules set to boot.

Especially egregious is the 'Setup' section, which is aloof in explaining the different "types" of your Action Cards. "Shop/Garage/Armory" action cards have the same backs as "non-resource" action cards, but their in-game economy (how many to start each game) differs from each other. The 'Setup' rules fail to emphasize that point, which led to confusing shuffles and sorting. This is further complicated by the Anomaly Cards - which have the same backs and which aren't mentioned for the first time until a nondescript "psst" on page 6 of 8. This led to some additonal time staring blankly at our rules/components and contemplating playing something else. 

[Outside of saving money in production, it doesn't seem like the Action cards all need to have the same card backs. If, say, Anomaly cards had different backs from the Shop/Garage/Armory cards, and were different again from the Exchange/Move/Advertise/Trash cards, comprehension, setup and tear down would be a lot easier].

The game is played over three rounds. Players play three action cards per round that let them take basic actions. Three such actions are acquiring parts for your time machines, aka resources. There are limited resources at each of the Shop, Garage, and Armory locations so these corresponding Action cards could dead-end you if your engine isn't clicking. 

Other actions include Trash (get rid of a resource), Exchange (swap out one of your time machine's resources for another), Move (slide a resource from one time machine to another), and Advertise (promise to travel to a particular location in the current round for an additional point, but losing 3 points if you fail to do so). 

Locations require a particular combo of resources to gain entry. The more complicated set of resources needed, the higher the VP for sending a time machine to that location. 

During rounds 2 and 3 players take three more action cards and execute said actions. But in these two later rounds, each player must first replay - in card order - their played cards from previous rounds before selecting and playing their three new action cards. 

So over the course of the game, 18 total actions are played, and one builds a programmed card series/engine that's repeated and added to each round. 18 lines of BASIC, as it were.

Inefficiency results in loss of points in the form "tears"; aka rips in the timeline for taking actions that no longer exist. For example, if you take a resource action (gain a part from the Shop, Garage, or Armory) and there are no resources left to be taken, you lose a point. If your ship goes to a location with more resources than that location requires, you lose a point. Three misplays/tear chips penalize you -1 / -3 / -6 points. Four "strikes" and you are eliminated from the game. 

While technically there is player elimination, in Loop, Inc. one would likely just "not" perform actions that would cause elimination, and the game is short enough that it's not a long break from the table. Unfortunately, in our game I wanted to voluntarily take my fourth tear chip so that I could wink out of existence and stop playing.

Loop, Inc. was not going to be my preferred cup of tea to begin with, since I'm not a fan of "programming in Basic" type games. No interaction. Dry as a bone. Super fiddly for what you actually get to do, and an absolute table slog if you happen to play with AP-prone players. 

If you are a player that revels in seeing a glorious, perfectly fluid vision of an 18-turn scoring engine 18-steps in advance, and feel surges of power when you enact said efficiency engine, you'll love this game.

That said, there are games that do have programming-DNA in them far more fun and interactive than Loop, Inc., such as the spirited mayhem of RoboRally, or the "plans go awry" glee and cooperative stress of Space Cadet. 

Loop, Inc. is a simple card trick performed by a magician. You know magic isn't real and that's fine. It's "you pick a card, he does stuff, he finds your selected card." The trick itself is not as flashy as their outfit or charming patter. It takes them a bit longer than it should to conduct the shuffles and riffles leading to the trick's inevitable conclusion. It's flawlessly and expertly executed. Then there's the magician's reveal, you shrug and say "yup, that's my card," and the trick is over.

Pick up pieces you need based on your movements, but know that these movements will repeat in later turns and can lead to failure instead of success. The goal is planning but the strategy component isn't enough to encourage you to think deeper into the game.

This is a really clever game, though I expect that its lack of popularity is due to how niche it feels. The game is surprisingly short also, but the fact that you can be eliminated forces you to puzzle out every move as much as possible. That's really what this game is; a puzzle you set up for yourself. It's very unique and innovative in this way, but it almost feels like this was supposed to be part of a bigger game. Maybe it became too fiddly at that scope, but I do think that they could have expanded on this idea further. As it is, Loop Inc. is easily my favorite time traveling board game to date.

Bought this via Kickstarter, played once with four players. I have never, NEEEVER, seen a game fall as flat 
, limp, and dead on the table as this one.

The art says 'light, breezy, fun!". The gameplay is stale heavy and slooooooooow. Cards are too small and too complex to discern from across the table. Score track and markers are cute but completely nonfunctional. The entire game is spent trying not to die from too many time tears.

Sold it at a loss as fast as I could.

Oh, don't believe the Kwanchai artwork for a second.  Loop Inc. is a brain-burner of the highest order, and an interactive one at that.  Almes crafted an amazing exercise in recurrence and paradoxical anomaly, where every decision you make absolutely will come back to haunt you in the next round.  I can see a Guioco Piano-style universally accepted-as-good opening for Round One -- two or three opening moves, actually -- but after that round all bets are off, and even that opening is incredibly dependent upon the time-travel trips available that game.

And all this brain burn happens in less than 30 minutes.

With a multitude of options to add once you understand the core game, Loop Inc. is easily one of my favorite games of 2015.

Needlessly confusing with serious AP-issues ("analysis paralysis"). 

The loss from not covering all bases and reliably predicting what parts you get can seriously cost you. However, covering all bases is nearly impossible, or would take too much time. The error proneness is built-in to the mechanic.

The premise sounds super interesting, time travelling! But each time you travel back in time you must redo the actions you did the first time you travelled back. Glitches, tears anomalies, all fits in well. But alas, it seems to have limited options on the path to victory. Replayability won't be that great.

Solid game about time traveling. Has that nice snowballing effect when you have to think about what to play in addition to playing past actions. A good medium light to medium mini brain game. Will try with stretch goal Expansions and solo play soon.

Love the theme. A more thoughtful game than I suspected. Maybe even brain-burny at times. I'm not usually a fan of games where limited resources are such a crutch, but players will likely be swapping time machine parts fairly frequently, meaning you're never truly hopeless.

This is my brain-twisty, medium weight Euro game. Tons of fun, if I do say so myself. The basic premise is that you go back in time in order to try and send more customers on time travel trips... but, your past self is running around and you have to follow the same actions as before without tearing a hole in the time space continuum.  The rules are pretty straight forward... but playing the best way is not. There's a lot going on here.

And, Kwanchai's art on it is amazing!

Time travel done right

:thumbsup: - Amazing time travel action selection game
:thumbsup: - Simple but crazy brain burny 
:thumbsup: - Hilarious flavor text

:thumbsdown: - Needs hidden screens
:thumbsdown: - The actual traveling to other times is very abstract, doesn't feel like you are visiting those locations

Surprisingly thinky for such a short and simple game. All you really are doing is collecting parts for your time machines to match the cards for the trips that your time machines are going to take. The challenge is not so much the first round, but in subsequent rounds how you are forced to take the same actions as the first round in the same order. As the number of parts are limited and you are penalized for being second for a given trip, you find yourself trying to work around not only your opponents, but also the problems you created for yourself from your earlier turns. Interesting decisions, indeed.

Interesting, time-travel game where the theme works surprisingly well! 

Players work at Loop, Inc., taking tourists on trips through time to earn money. The trips are on a random subset of cards, placed in a display during setup. To earn more money, you go back in time to the start of your day -- twice. Each time, then, you have an extra time machine. Of course, you must repeat the previous 3 actions in the same order as before; but then you also have the whole day to take another 3 actions (so 9 total on round 3)! The actions allow you to add equipment to your machine(s) if any are available in inventory, move equipment around, reserve a target by advertising (suffer penalty if you fail to deliver!), or take a variety of special actions. Whenever you try to take an action but cannot fulfill it (e.g., supply is empty), you take a "tear" penalty (total 1/2/3 = lose 1/3/6 VP; 4 = lose game). During one of your actions, you may take one of your time machine(s) on a trip. For reasons unclear to me, though, you may never go to the same location more than once. Each destination requires a time machine with a specific set of equipment. Any extra pieces on the time machine fall off (-1 VP each). The player with the most VP at the end wins.

This is a cool puzzle of a game: try use your set of actions most efficiently to create properly equipped time machines, while considering that you will have to use that SAME series of actions again next day. The inventory is limited, so you have to carefully decide when to jump in and use a new action (instead of waiting for the right action, buried in your hand of cards, to come up). 

However, there were a few problems:
- after setup, there is absolutely no randomness, and I like a little randomness in my games! There is, however, some player chaos to deal with -- when they take that crucial piece of equipment you NEED!
- BAD production. The artwork is pretty, but dysfunctional. The score track has spaces in different shapes, sizes, and colors -- very difficult to use. The trip art is nice, but the cards and icons are SO FREAKING SMALL that it's hard to see them from across the table!
- it just wasn't very much fun! Maybe it would be better with further play, but in the first game it just seemed too much of a struggle trying to negotiate your way through the system, and then too much frustration when you couldn't do anything productive (day 3)!

This is an interesting game of management with a time travel theme.  The basis is that each player is traveling through time and visiting a specific period in time requires  a certain time machine configuration.  The game is played across 3 rounds and each round you increase the number of time machines at your disposal by 1 and number of actions you take by 3.  The neat gimmick of the game is that you need to take the same actions you did in the previous round in the same order as well as adding 3 new actions to it.  So by the third round you have to take your previous 6 actions in the same order while adding 3 new ones.  This can cause quite the brain burn because messing up and having actions take place that you cannot perform will cause a paradox and paradoxes lose you points or can cause you to lose the  game outright.

I really like the concept here but wish the game did more with it.  Options seemed plentiful so causing paradoxes seemed unlikely reducing the tension that could really make this game exciting.  And this is even coming from someone who had an opponent steal the last available component I needed in the final round.  I simply went to a different location that needed fewer components and lost points for my extras.  This is separate from a paradox and isn't a huge loss.

I also think the options in the game aren't very varied so the game doesn't have a very long shelf life.  And the theme didn't come through very well, the mechanics are neat but I didn't get why I needed a wheel and spikes on my time machine to visit the Renaissance.  Finally, the art style isn't for me.  It's not bad based on what it is going for but the "construction paper cut-out" style just doesn't appeal to me.

You build ships and travel. The time travel theme kind of seems tacked on. This could have been about building an RV for a vacation, or building an aircraft to travel, or building robots to complete specific tasks. The game is mostly about building. I really like time travel games, but this one really isn't about time travel. You do have to reuse all of the actions from previous turns, so there's that loop thing going on, but that's about it. My brain kind of hurt after playing trying to plan ahead, keep my opponent from getting his needed resources, and getting the resources I needed before they were gone.

Loop Inc. is a game about time travel. The game has a very family-ish look and feel to it with cartoon-y graphics.

In the game you're outfitting your time machine with parts (wheels, propellers, nets, telescopes and some sort of pitchforky weapon thing) so that you can be a tour guide to the world's famous events. The twist is that you'll be replaying this day three times over and that you'll have to repeat the actions you did in the previous day, and do them in the same order.

Each world event requires a ship with some configuration of gear. You can't visit an event if you don't qualify with the appropriate gear. Having extra stuff is okay, but it'll break off and cost you points. You can't repeat the same event, so you'll need to plan ahead so that the ship you outfit for your first mission can be reconfigured for a second and third mission... and your second ship (which you get on the first repetition of the day) can do its first and second mission. And your third ship (which you get on the final repetition) can do a mission.

The way the game works is that there are three shops with the gear you need (but only as many items of each type as there are players). Each day you'll have to do 3 new actions... which you do by taking that card and then performing that action. There are cards to go to each store, but also some cards that let you move gear from one ship to another, or exchange an item from a ship with that of something from a store.

From the second day on, you have to do your old actions as well as three new actions. The old actions have to be played in the same order you did them previously, but you can interweave your new actions as needed. Planning ahead is incredibly vital in the game. If you end up in a situation where your action is impossible or no longer makes sense, you rip the space-time continuum, which if you do it often enough either costs you points or just flat out eliminates you from the game.

I thought this was a very interesting game. But there's a huge disconnect for me with the very childish, family friendly art and what is a very thinky brainburny game. But my larger complaint with the game is that the biggest decisions you'll make in the game are all before it starts.

You really want to have an upgrade path that makes sense so that your first ship can do a 1st day mission and then be ready for a 2nd and 3rd day mission with minimal adjustments. So the most important decision you'll probably make in the game is what you'll send your first ship to do (having planned out it's entire three days). And the game only has a limited number of trips you can plan, and your opponents are also trying to do the same things, so it's a very cutthroat game if you end up going after the same thing as someone else.

I usually like games that make me think, but I don't like that most of that thinking is frontloaded and that there's little room for deviation through the game. And the screwage factor is pretty high. It wasn't too much of an issue in my first game, but I was also playing a friendly game with my son. I'm not sure that I'd really enjoy playing this with other gamers. Overall, this is a game that I want to like more than I actually do.

The core idea - you keep having to replay your cards from earlier rounds in the same order - is interesting. Unfortunately the rest of the game is pretty dull so the net effect is not that exciting.

Brain burny but very clever action selection game. It seems very easy to start, then on the first loop you are suddenly going "wait - no; I can't do this now!". Rules aren't overly clear in a few places. I lost the first play, but I love it.

This is sort of a logistics puzzle, where you have to plan out a way to hit an escalating number of targets while reusing and redistributing resources. It starts out quite easy, but as the game progresses it becomes very challenging to keep up with the changing requirements without becoming wasteful and suffering penalties. The cleverest part of the game revolves around its time travel theme. Actions are executed via card play, but once a card has been played it becomes locked in its position. Going forward in later turns, all the cards will execute their effects over and over, in the same order. it's a real brain burner and easily the highlight of the show.

That's not really enough to compete for valuable shelf space though. It has an interesting premise, a neat mechanic and a decent brain burn...but in the end its still kind of forgettable and certainly not all that much "fun".

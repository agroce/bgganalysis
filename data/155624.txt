Super stressful! Components are bent to hell, but they're thin and asymmetric plastic minis, so that's understandable; just a bit annoying that the minis won't stand up on their own out of the box (this is likely a non-recurring problem, though, just take it as a note). This game suffers at 2 and 5 players, so it's a narrow success field, but it's still fun for 2 and 5 player games, just not nearly as much!

The tension Specter Ops creates is a palpable mess of sweaty hands and rapid hearts. As the agent, you've got a very limited amount of time to reach your goals, attempting to sabotage three of four locations on the map. You're given a small amount of abilities and the benefit of secret movement. Good luck.

As the hunters, you must try to locate and damage the agent or prevent them from reaching the exit once they've achieved their three goals. You're given a good amount of special abilities and a vehicle (that somehow always seems a little out of reach). While not a powerhouse game of variety, Specter Ops does what it does very well. There aren't many games like it on the market and it has certainly earned its position as one of the best cat-and-mouse experiences in gaming.

Fun Fact: I was a classmate of the artist on this game, back when we were both studio art students in college. It's awesome to see him doing cool stuff with his work.

RATING: 5.5
I do not generally enjoy hide-and-seek games and this one is particularly uninspired. The one hiding has certain advantages that seem extreme. The seekers are dull - even with their minorly differentiated abilities. The theme seems like a bad sci-fi channel concept - futuristic mumbo-jumbo, hackers, terrorists - it doesn't give life to the game, but instead just makes it dark and dreary - boring really. So a straight-up pass from me. For a much more thematic and enjoyable experience, play Whitechapel.

In my only play as the "humans" I found this a little too easy but I think that's partly due to the risk averse nature these games imply but in this case is not necessarily required. Was a bit long for what it was though so not sure how keen I would be to play again.

EXCELLENT hidden movement game.  The special powers are interesting, great components, high tension.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
1st play:  I don't own any other hidden movement games so I was looking forward to this one.  I really like the openness of the moves available and the special player powers are great.  It felt a bit long for what it was doing, but I had a good time playing it.  The length combined with lack of real depth - every decision is basically, do we think he went this way or that way, with no real reason to think it will be one or the other - means that this will not see playtime often.

2nd play: Definitely too long for the experience.  It's fun but the player powers really don't come into play often enough, and mostly it's a lot of randomly guessing where the agent went.  If it played in half the time, I think it would be cool, but it doesn't.  The theme is cool though.

Rulebook is short and simple but is poorly done and leaves a lot to be desired due to ambiguities and lack of clarifications that you only discover once a number of situations arise. The first few games raised a bunch of questions as there is zero clarification on what happens in common situations that require dropping everything and looking up answers online. Most of these come up because the rules leave a lot of room for interpretation and do not spell things out as clearly as they should. These questions brought the game to a grinding halt as we tried to find the answers which really hurt the enjoyment of the game. Once these things are figured out, the game becomes more enjoyable as you can play instead of try and figure out what the ambiguous rules actually mean.

Hunt or be hunted. The Hunters serve an 'oppressive', dystopian government streamlined towards technological and genetic perfection and space exploration, the Agent serves a rebellion which seeks to restore the ideals of freedom and individuality. Variable character abilities, colorful design which evokes an influence from the Metal Gear Solid 3 and 4 games ('The Beast', 'The Gun', 'The Prophet'), etc. Gameplay is hidden movement and deduction with some combat elements, and it's packed with tension and fun, so if you're into Letters from Whitechapel or Scotland yard and want to see that style of gameplay transplanted into a futuristic setting, just buy it.

I don't think secret unit placement is a compelling board game mechanic in general.

Initial Impression: A dark, cyberpunk-like future is the setting for this amazing cat-and-mouse game. I have to say up front that this is the best tag game I've played so far. The fact that both factions have multiple characters with powers make for a different experience each time. Clever play with just the right balance of risk taking makes this a thriller until the end. The well sculpted miniatures scream to be painted.

I have not played this game near enough to give any type of rating so i'll just comment on my experience. I got this from my Fiance for Christmas and her brother wanted to play the minute I unwrapped it. He isn't a heavy gamer at all, pretty certain he knows pretty much about Monopoly and Cards Against Humanity. I figured I may as well cause I can at least see how it plays.

Anyone who has ever got a new game knows that you should normally read the rules in advance and then explain them. I wasn't really given this choice so I read the rule book and explained it as I went. From my perspective the game was quite forward and very simple to understand, I think he was slightly lost, and I'm not 100% positive if it was lack of explaining on my part, or lack of experience on his. I'd guess a little of both.

So we played through and I could see how this game could be a lot of fun, and I'm looking forward to playing it with my gaming group and see how they respond and see how it plays with people who understand board games. 

I do think though, if you are a heavy euro-gamer, I really doubt you'd enjoy this one.

Takes the idea of hidden movement and deduction and turns it into an innovative game that feels just like a stealth video game. Sneaking around a corner just before being discovered, blinding your enemies with smoke bombs before darting across their path, and slinking out of the base by the skin of your teeth all add to the thematic, tense experience, and that's just as the agent! As the hunters you implement your collective powers and (very useful) vehicle to find the fiendish agent before they escape, all while dodging their various traps. Thrilling, thematic, and stressful in the best way. This is not a game to pass up!

RATING: 7
Played it once. Interesting, but it has a hell of a flaw: it's an absolute bear to teach to new players if you don't have any veterans on hand to help.

That's because the Agent (the player being hunted) has a number of one-shot tricks up his sleeve. If you have a bunch of new players taking the role of the Hunters, they have to sit through a lengthy and rather boring discussion of all the one-shot tricks the Agent MIGHT have if they want to have any chance at victory. Otherwise, the deductive-reasoning aspect of the game flies right out the window and they'll feel like the Agent was cheating his butt off even though sneaking past them without being seen in that one instance actually was sanctioned by the rules. When you're still getting your head wrapped around the base mechanics, it's a hell of a lot to digest.

But once you get over that learning curve, it's fun and tense. Not on my must-own list, but I could definitely see this rating going up a notch or two with more plays.

(Though the game I played had something I've never encountered before in a co-op. One of the players basically refused to mentally engage, and insisted the rest of the team tell him what to do. I try to avoid being That Guy in a co-op, but what the hell are you supposed to do when your only other choice is to watch Captain Ditherpants do nothing for five minutes? No idea if that was a fluke bad experience, or if there's something about the game that makes that behavior likely.)

Also, best exchange:
The agent (Cobra) misplayed Adrenal Surge to move 10 spaces rather than 6 earlier in the game.
Prophet, but no one else, has been stunned twice by Cobra.
"For a precog you get ambushed a lot, Prophet.  The Chief said you were the man for the job, but I'm not seeing it."

This deduction, hidden movement game gives a similar experience to games like "Letters From Whitechapel" or the newer "Last Friday", but does so with less confusion and does so in about an hour. The agent is writing down their movement, while the hunters are attempting to see and finish off the agent. Play is on a grid, and any time the player crosses a line of sight (which is very easy to determine in this game) with a hunter, they must put a token to note it. If after eother a hunter's or an agent's turn ends with line of sight, the agent reveals their location, as well as who their character is. Both the agent and the hunters have their choices of uniquely powered characters. The agent's goal is to hit 3 out of 4 flags essentially, then escape. 

So far, I have not found a hidden movement game that I prefer over this one. The length is perfect for a game of this nature, whereas longer games such as letters from white chapel can overstay their welcome for me. If you like hidden movement give this one a try.

2 Notes:
1) Play on a well lit table, as the markings on the board can be difficult to pick out otherwise.
2) I have not yet played fury of dracula, and expect I would like it immensely despite its play length.

Initial Impressions:
----------------------
Wow.  This is hidden movement done right.  As both the agent and the hunter, you really have tough interesting choices to make, with a super streamlined game flow that works so well.  The game is SUPER tense, and lived up to all the hype around it. The rules are a little rough, at this point there is enough FAQ references to get through some of missed details in the rules.   Man oh man... This is one I want to get back to the table soon.  Really neat game.  I hope this gets tons of expansion support, because the system is great, and I hope to play this one for many years to come.  Best hidden movement game out there?  It very well could be...

I wanted to like this a lot more than I did.  I've always dug the hidden movement mechanic dating way back to my childhood with Clue The Great Museum Caper.  This has a cool sort of cyber punk theme and characters with unique powers which are also things I like.  But in my 3 or 4 plays of it I found it to be pretty unbalanced and random- I think the main problem I had was that the hunters need to be on the ball and working together to have much of a chance.  Maybe that comes with experience?  But I felt like we should have been getting the hang of it after that much time.  Letters from Whitechapel remains at the top of the genre.

Fairly fun 1 vs many hidden movement game, with one player being the hidden agent and the other players basically being security guards trying to kill him.

Might have been more fun with only two players, where one is the agent and the other controls two or more hunters.

A standard cat and mouse game. (a la Scotland Yard, Whitehall Mysteries, Garibaldi).

A hidden movement game of 1vMany along the lines of Letters from Whitechapel or Fury of Dracula. This version had some interesting bits with the player powers (both Hunter and Agent), but the Agent played around 2/3 of my powers, rendering them useless. I've now played all 3 of these games one time. I guess it's an ok mechanic but not one I am going to seek out or recommend.

RATING: 6
My major gripe with this game is that 40 turns is way too much. It effectively incentivizes stalling tactics. Maybe the map is a bit too big (not entirely sure) but the game takes too long to play if both team want to play optimally. There doesn't seem to be any real mechanic that incentivizes risk taking. Instead, Hunter can just camp the most important corners until they get a sight of the Agent. If the Agent for example had some standard ability to momentarily sabotage the Vehicle if he managed to get close enough (directly adjacent) there might be some extra tension. I know about the promo EMP bomb, but I don't have it and it's a one use thing (I think).

"Hide and Seek" the Board Game. One of the most boring games I've ever played. You not only have very little to do on your turn, but you do it again, and again, and again for over an hour. Did they go this way or that way? Should I run here or there? When do I press the button? Who cares? 

This is a game for children.

Very thematic hidden movement game with a couple of small twists.  Overall, this game doesn't offer a whole lot of innovation, but it's very well designed and solid.  The main new element that separates it from other similar designs is the traitor aspect of a five player game.  This is outstanding and extremely interesting.  Other than the traitor though, this is a very thematic hidden movement game with special powers for each player.

This is quite a good game.  In the vein of Letters From Whitechapel, Nuns On The Run, and yes Scotland Yard (which I only mention because it's the "original" but I have never played it before) we have another hidden movement game.  I really enjoy Letters from Whitechapel, and except for some of the Line of Sight rules in Nuns on the Run I really enjoy it too.  This one adds a cool Sci-fi theme, and some cool characters (which are already begging for an expansion to add cards and characters to the game.)  With these games the thing I don't like is that one player with AP can really slow the game down, even when that AP is part of the team rather than playing individually (although I have seen the "Jack" character really drag a game of Whitechapel).  None of the roles seem OP to me and all fit within a team structure.  Playing with 4 players (3 hunters and 1 agent) seems the most balanced to me, but more plays may find this a bit different.  I would love to play this game more, but don't feel I need it in my collection.

It's one of the better hidden movement games, but the stakes aren't really that elevated over the course of the game. Some nice mechanics combine for a solid, enjoyable experience, but there are others in the genre that edge it out, whichever way you prefer your hidden movement games.

Great atmospheric board artwork. The different hunters and agents abilities are interestingly varied. The models are nice but the car really should have been a model too rather than an abstract round token. Not sure about how well balanced this is yet. Playing the saboteur is quite nerve racking.
Record of plays so far:
2 players - 1 x agent win.
4 players - 3 x hunter wins. Biased towards the hunters at this player count, I think.
5 players - 2 x hunter wins. Lots of paranoia as no unconfirmed reports can be relied upon. Reasonably balanced. I like this player number best.

RATING: 5
*5* (Initial plays)
I haven't played this genre of game much and after my first play this genre may not be for me. The gameplay felt too simple. It would be more interesting to have stronger goals rather than pushing a button. The gameplay also moved at a slower pace than I prefer. I would try again but nothing I would seek out and play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
An exciting experience that shouldn't be missed and will only improve with character expansions.

EDIT: After more plays, I love it even more. Playing as a Hunter and trying to figure out the Agent's movements is a blast--especially as the Prophet, who can work out a narrative of the Agent's movement.

SECOND EDIT: I'm still wrapping my head around a few rules, namely related to movement on foot and by car. It also bothers me that the car token takes up the same amount of space as a single character--which sounds silly, but it's easily lost on the giant board. And on that note, new players often mistake some grid spaces as wall because they are quite dark.

RATING: 8.5
Grande gioco che per me sostituisce altri titoli con la meccanica Hidden Movement, come la furia di Dracula o Letters from WhiteChapel. Un gioco tattico che si basa sull'interazione e i punti di vista del gruppo di cacciatori che dovranno cercare di mettersi d'accordo per non farsi sfuggire l'agente che sta cercando di sabotare i loro piani! Unica pecca del gioco, una meccanica a 5 giocatori forzatissima che sembra abbastanza ingiocabile, ma se si rientra sui 2-4 giocatori lo si può vivere come una vera caccia all'uomo e un ottimo gioco di fiuto o premonizioni!

Specter Ops works okay, but it's really dull as far as hidden movement games work. I like the player powers, but it's absolutely terrible at building tension. Even with the traitor, really you've just got one player trying to play terribly because that's really all they can do to assist. They could try to lead other players away from where they think the agent it, but they don't really know where the agent is to do that.

One of the few games we stopped playing after 15 minutes.
The agent probably had some tension. But the three hunter players were bored out of their minds. In Scotland Yard we at least had some knowledge of where
Mr. X could be hiding. Here we were stumbling around in the dark not really making any deductive choices as where
to place our hunters. Had such high hopes for this game since the components are outstanding. But somewhere along the way they forgot the deductive reasoning that
Scotland Yard provided. Oh well can`t win them all.

Great game. If you like Fury of Dracula but you like SF the more go for this. Great great theme. Played as agent and as hunter. Had blast both times playing as Hunter and as Agent.

RATING: 8
I've only played the Agent side thus far. It was a lot of fun when I was walking away with the game, because I felt clever; it was a lot of fun when I got caught and nearly cornered because it was a tense, gripping challenge. I'd hope that the Hunters would also have fun when doing either well or poorly, but I could imagine that not having much success might simply be frustrating? Still, there are a number of ways in which the game conspires to keep the Hunters at least roughly on the trail, and the Agent can go down quite quickly if caught out in a bad spot.

The sense of hunter-and-hunted was excellent. Great feel.

EDIT: The hunter side was enjoyable, too - until our Agent got frustrated due to misunderstanding a rule, which kind of hosed them over. :\

Nice hidden movement game in a 1 v many structure with added traitor element with the right player count. The map is just tight enough so that the hunters are never too far away but the agent has plenty of alleys to dash up and tricks to keep them at bay. My only slight gripe with it is the downtime as the agent but as it is hidden movement you expect to not be doing much outside your turn. Also play time can run a little long if the agent is over cautious and the hunters too thorough.

A very tense and fun game. Although nothing beats playing the agent, the hunters are also pretty fun to play (although the experience can fall apart if the agent is struggling too much).

Easy to learn and teach, mostly straightforward, although the rules regarding the vehicle are a bit lacking. 
One problem we tend to have with the game is that it's easy to miss the ends-of-turns, but that may just be our group.

With five and a traitor this game really shines. I like it with 3 also, very much. It's a much more straightforward game that way and the hidden movement is front and center. With 5 the agent is going to get tracked down but that's just when the shenanigans begin. The traitor has to be very skilled at predicting his partner's play. And once revealed, the second agent is still hunting, but has to figure out how to get in the war and help the cause.

This game completely fires the deeply flawed Letter from Whitechapel.

RATING: 8
Fun and tense "Hide and Seek" style game with players having Variable Powers to use on their turns.  
Biggest complaint is the 5-player game tends to be lopsided.  If you are selected to be the "hidden partner" then you purposely are making weak decisions to throw the other team off the trail.  If discovered as the "hidden partner" the your role now becomes even more diminished as you become a mere "distraction" while everyone shifts their attention towards the initial target.  
Overall, a fun game that seems to only get pulled out once in a while.  Rarely has it been played "back to back."
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
What the heck?  Unless we got a rule wrong, this game seems borderline broken.  We zero'ed in on the agent so easily and he could never get away.  The scanner on the car prevented him from doing and "doubling-back". We could find the direction he was in...and deduce where he went from there. Killing him was so easy.  On the plus side, the board is pretty cool looking.

RATING: 8
It won't replace your favorite hidden movement game, but it definitely compliments the sparse landscape.  What sets it apart are line-of-sight rules and special abilities for the hidden agent as well as the hunters.  With these additions to the formula, the deduction is solid and tense.  The game is cat-and-mouse at its best and this game could easily be expandable (and probably will be).  By zooming in close to the action, Specter Ops takes the traditional manhunt and makes it a highly tactical experience where it takes more skill to play the agent than it does the hunter - a neat twist on this type of game.

Plays fast and is light on component density; easy to get to the table!

One Vs. All, Med-Heavy

Very fun hidden movement game.  Definitely preferred over Letters From Whitechapel as it balances out the power between Hunters and Agent.  Adding up to 3 hunters does not hurt them like it does in LfW, it helps them.  Traitor mechanic is very fun but I'd suggest it only for experienced players as it has some hard to understand rules and there will be various situations where the rulebook doesn't explain what to do.  You gotta make a fair judgement call sometimes.  I like how all the Hunters are very balanced. Agents, I still think The Blue Jay or Orangutan are the two best Agents by a long shot, with the Cobra or Spider being the best double Agent.

This is a one vs. all hidden movement game. One of the benefits is that it plays faster than some of the notable games in this genre (i.e. Whitechapel and Fury of Dracula). I think some players also really enjoy that everyone has unique player powers. The hidden operative also has hidden equipment that can be used to surprise the hunters. The board is good and the rules also seemed well-written. There is even a hidden traitor option when playing with 5 people. I would much rather play this 2-player with the hunter controlling multiple characters. I say this because I find what makes these kinds of games drag is the constant discussion that bogs down the game play. That said, it's probably why I don't do that well in these sorts of games and don't enjoy them as much as other people. It's probably one of the best of the genre and will be improved once the app is released to assist the operative. Though, it's still not one for me.

Seriously. Play this game with 3. It isn't good with 4 and I do admit I haven't tried the traitor game.
3 feels like the right way to play, with a good amount of tension for all players. The hunters have to work to win and the agent can be clever in their actions. I know most people want to play with the full complement but considering hunters can and will just sit in the car to trap the agent, it does just suck the fun out of the experience.
Ranking based on average. 3 player makes it a 7, 4+ makes it a 4. Did not try the 2 Player game, but imagine it would be similar to the 3p game.
The 4p mode and car killed it for me, as did the massive amount of errata.

Specter Ops is one the most thematic, highest quality build, most memorable science fiction feel like role playing/hide-and-seek/hero ability/co-op game ever! The pros I want to say about this game are tons.

but let me start off with a few disclaimer, this game can be hard to grasp for some people who doesn't understand the rule wells on their first play, because, the combination of ability card, location coordination, character's ability on both side can create a lot of imperfect information! And because of that, this game is hard to win no matter which side do you play.

Other than that, this game provides a solid experience on roleplaying as one of the side, the Hunter or the Agent, the chaser or the runner. The ability might resemble some feeling when you play a MOBA(multi player battle arena online game) because of the character design and the abilities and such. This game will give you immense excitement once you start playing. Strongly suggest you watch a play through video and see it for yourself. It should capture the game pretty good

Played with 3.  I was a the Gun and mainly stayed on the road to know when the Agent crossed the roads.  Overall, we were able to corner him a few times and waited him out, game came down to a die roll from my Quick Draw, if I missed he was on the exit.

With 5 I wouldn't care for this.

With 4, it becomes a lot more difficult for the Agent.

We really like this game.  THe components are fantastic, but there aren't very many of them.  Which is almost a metaphor for the game itself.  It's really a very simple game.  And it's not one of those games that is more complex then it looks; it's not.

But that's OK!  It a great game to play with friends who might get scared off by by a bigger game.  

It's also well balanced.  It's always a nail-biter and its always fun and it plays well (and very differently) at each amount of players.

2 player - great cat and mouse
3 player - cat and mouse and teamwork
4 player - even more teamwork - super tense for the agent
5 player - adds a betrayal/werewolf aspect

Scores lower for me because I do not like co-ops (the hunter side). I only bought it because it was half price on clearance. Pretty good , tense hidden movement game.

RATING: 8.5
As the agent, if the enemy isn't very strategic, the game can be very quick and easy. If the enemy is more literally counting every possible step you are taking and has you narrowed down to 3 spaces in the first 3 moves, the game is probalbly over on turn 10....

By a mile the best hidden movement game I have ever played. The designer was able to rescue the elegance and simplicity of the hidden movement that got lost in the burdensome addenda of games like Garibaldi or Letters from Whitechapel, streamline it with squares and numbered reference. Then, he added very simple but evocative chasing rules, wonderful player powers (that Plaidhat condensed into characters) and equipments. amazing.

Bought because it has a more family-friendly theme, plays faster, has more variety in player powers, and is more likely to make it to the table than Letters from Whitechapel, but scratches the same itch.  We'll see.

UPDATE: finally played it 3p.  Played as a hunter. Fantastic.  Great tension, great cat & mouse.

An awesome hidden movement game. It's like letters from whitechapel only with some light combat, and the constables  (hunters) have special powers to help give them an edge in certain situations. The artwork is great, the board is beautiful, the theme is cool, the minis are solid, if you like hidden movement games you will likely fall in love with this one.

This has everything I've always wanted in a hidden movement game, without having a theme that pushes me away. I've never been interested in Letters from Whitechapel or Fury of Dracula due to the theme. However, I love the spy theme and I love the special abilities of the hunters and agents. Not to mention the miniatures were fantastic! I played as the agent and lost but still had a blast playing.

I have tried very hard to love this game.  I love the hidden movement genre (Letters from Whitechapel, Whitehall, and Scotland Yard are among some of my favorite games), but this game just seems to take too long to play and to explain.  The concept is fabulous, but I always have a tough time trying to explain this game to others, and as such, it seems to just get lost in the process.  I think for a first game you need to play without the items and it's still a difficulty to get through.

RATING: 4
Hidden movement game that can be taught in just a few minutes. The play is simple and "to the point," but with very few special abilities, once the hidden player is found, he/she is easy to track. The deduction came down to several 50/50 decisions. I would like to see more special actions that surprise the players and make the deduction more interesting.

Specter Ops has stolen the crown from Fantasy Flight as the undisputed hidden movement game available. 

I own Letters from Whitechapel and Fury of Dracula (2nd edition. Fury of Dracula (score-9) offers a more complex experience but has mechanics that needed sharpening and refining. Letters adds almost no other elements to the hidden movement dynamic to enhance the theme and suffers from being ponderous and one dimensional.

By adding together elements from both of these games, and learning lessons from their mistakes - Plaid Hat has taken the genre up another half-level with Specter Ops. 

For those unaware, hidden movement games use a board with numbered or labeled spaces. One character has an objective that necessitates moving across the board by secretly noting their chosen space, while the other players work co-operatively to capture or kill the "runner" by entrapment.

In Specter Ops, set in a futuristic counter-Ops setting, creative variable powers and tools mean the pursuers have more options to consider and deploy strategically. The agent has hit points, adding to the tableau of desperate gambits that are possible. The runner can be hit, but can also escape to fight another day if clever enough.

In Letters, the runner (Jack-the-Ripper), must repeatedly return to a hideout space after killing an innocent at a location on the board. In Fury, Dracula must simply escape and survive. In Specter, the secret agent must complete several objectives at different board locations that are not necessarily known to the pursuers and then escape.

Though the game does not feature true combat like FoD (a system that needed improvement), Specter Ops gives the agent secret abilities and high-tech weapons to thwart pursuers in interesting ways.

I love the powers that allow you to move more spaces on a turn and not reveal that you did so until a turn or two later. Flash bangs, stun guns, etc. The pursuers also have a hi-tech car that can be used (for a price) as a directional quadrant compass, meaning the runner can never get too far away before the hunt heats up again 9 a big problem with Whitechapel).

The only question in my book is whether Fantasy Flight will Trump this latest entry with the new edition of Fury of Dracula due out later this year. 

The bar is high!

I've only played this once so far as a two-player game, and I really enjoyed it. I really like that each of the agents and hunters have different powers, so I would think that depending on who you're playing as, the game can feel quite different. It feels like a grown-up version of Clue: The Great Museum Caper, one of my favourite games when I was a kid. Update: Finally got to play it with 4 players, and enjoyed it just as much. Think it's more fun for the agent player when there are multiple hunters, listening to their discussions about where he or she could be.

Very good game that replaced Letters from Whitechapel in my case. It is shorter, the theme is more apealing to me, and the special abilities make every character, and so the player who controls it, somewhat special. I have to say, though, that the traitor mechanic makes the game much less "clean", elegant and fun and, in fact, makes it a very bad game. Some people in my gaming group liked it but bear in mind that it will lead you to many doubts regarding the rules that, if asked by the agent before moving, would disclose his or her strategy. Questions like "Can I, the second agent, stand betwen the hunters and the agent so you can't shoot him?", and theme-breaking situations like The Gun trying not to see the second agent so he could do his ability Sniper Shot (it states that you can't do it if you see the agent). I won't ever play this game with five players because it ruined the experience and even the gaming session (we all went home after this 4-hour game quarrelling over and over again about the rules and how thematically broken some moves were). 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Probably best with exactly 3. The 2 vs 1 gameplay is pretty unique and the different characters add a surprising amount variety. The whole game however, often feels like you're pulling at strings in the dark hoping you didn't make a single mistake that would cost you the entire game. It has the problem where you might have very valuable information but you cannot mechanically do anything about it.

Original Rating: 9

Revised Rating: 8 - So this is my first hidden movement game. I'm not sure if this is a problem with the genre or just with this particular game, but I'd have to say the game is much more fun as a spy. My boyfriend won't even play the hunter side (although he does like the Spy side). Fun factor is skewed, at least at lower player counts. I've only ever played with 2 and three players. I think that's the real meat of the problem: this game maybe shouldn't be played with fewer than 4 or 5? I've never had the chance to play at a higher number so I'm not sure, but I suspect that's the case. I had so much fun playing the first time that It's staying in my collection. I'm just worried.

RATING: 7
Some games can be tense and nail-biting but other games can end by turn 16 due to players not cooperating, being dumb or heck even the agent being super amazing and uncatchable. I guess that's the point of the game, but it can lead to real lame and boring games 

I personally prefer Fury of Dracula of this, hence why I got rid of it. I also hate the rule book. It leaves to many questions unanswered for some mechanics. I hope the new version fixes this issue

I'd consider this a base hidden movement game, which is good, there just isn't a whole lot going on in it. The 5 player variant is pretty interesting with the hidden traitor and the production values are great - fantastic minis.

The only hidden movement game I have had in my collection. So far the agent has won both 2/3-player games and lost both 4-player games. This is in no way a Fury of Dracula, but it does what it means to do well in a rather short amount of time. It is streamlined enough that I think non-gamers could play this without too much difficulty.

Only played the role of the one capturing the objectives and escaping, enjoyed it decently enough for the first few turns and increasingly began to not care if I got captured so the game would end. It got too repetitive too quickly. Too much, "Still can't see me." "How about now?" "Nope." "Really?" "Yup." "Ok...how about now?" "Let me check....nope."

Generally overstayed its welcome, although I had more fun with it than my friend trying to catch me did.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (June 2015)

I had a huge expectation toward Specter Ops. First, I love the theme, Second, it is a Plaid Hat game, however I was disappointed.

I cannot pinpoint what I dislike about game, but I have come to realize that perhaps I dislike the whole “Hidden Movement” genre. Specter Ops is one of the best in the genre but I still didn’t have much fun playing it (and I was the Agent and won the game). The Agent player can cheat easily (intentional or unintentionally), I have never seen a player who wanted to check all the Agent movements after the end of the game.

The rules are dead easy and I found the rulebook to be regular. The art and miniatures are great but my copy of the game came with and unglued board. I fixed it easily but I think Plaid Hat Games is the company that, most often than not, sells games that come damaged in some way. However their customer service has always been topnotch.

I love that the players have abilities and equipment and the traitor variant is good and appeals a lot to me, but when I played the game I didn’t feel the tension I was hoping/expecting. Also it bothers me the slow pace of the game, as the Agent, many times you have to move 2 or less spaces or the radar will tell the hunters which direction you are, this is the only viable move at the beginning or the hunters will be onto you in 2 moves. This makes for a slow game.

With 4 players it seems to be very hard for the Agent and with 5 players it seems very hard for the Hunters, they need to expose the traitor ASAP or lose. Due to this, I think it is best for 3 players with the added benefit of increasing the game pace (I haven’t tried it with 3). In general I feel the game is harder for the Agent, the hunters have lots of abilities to easily pinpoint/deduce the Agent location, only by using the equipment I was able to evade them when they found me. The best Agent ability is Blue Jay´s (I don’t remember the name) but completing objectives at a distance seems very powerful to me.
 
Bottom line, I already sold my copy of the game. I want to play it again in the future to see what I’m missing, but I got bored by the game, I didn’t feel the promised tension. For now, it is a borderline 6.0 with room to plummet.

Early impressions:  Specter Ops is a lot of fun!  We liked the variety in Agents, Hunters, and gear.  Different combos are useful at different times.  The theme is solid.  I don't care for the very, very soft plastic the miniatures are made of, but that's a minor complaint.  The game's 40 turn limit keeps things on schedule, so it doesn't drag forever (Fury of Dracula).  The motion sensor mechanic keeps the hunters from ever being utterly lost (Letters from Whitechapel).  It will take more plays to be sure, but this might be my favorite hidden movement game!

I love the fact this is very thematic, yet simple, yet very thinky. Every move you make is pivotal. Cool minis but docking half a mark for some of the other components. Why are the stun markers so tiny? It is not like there isn't room in the mostly empty box; a few more cards would have been nice. And I have had better quality dice out of a Christmas cracker.

RATING: 7.25
Having declared that I had some expectations for this one, I have to say that it did not quite meet those expectations.  :(  

The artwork, including the box, board, cards, and minis is none short of a 9 or 10 rating on their own.  The concept of hidden movement in a giant facility with characters that each have special individualized powers is great and exciting.  This is one of the better produced games, insofar as art direction and conceptual design, that I have encountered thus far.  
The card quality is not great, however, and the mini's are a bit too soft for my liking.  Still, the production values are wonderful overall and certainly eye-catching.        

The gameplay, though, is where I was rather let down.  Our games were oft marred by rules that were hard to remember how to follow properly (i.e. not intuitive at all), and/or rule checks to clarify the special powers and interaction of characters on nearly every turn we played (many times with dispute as to how to resolve them even after referencing the rules and forums).  In short, its not as elegant of a gameplay system as I had hoped; not by a long shot.

While I am understanding that more plays will result in less rules clarifications/checks and less mistakes by the agent player to bog the game down or invalidate it, I can't ever see it being an effortless system either; it involved that much convolution for what should otherwise be a simple set of mechanics. In other words, it just can't seem to get out of its own way enough to allow for the fun it should produce, which significantly impacts the flow of the game as well.  Heck, there were a few Agent cards that I chose not to use simply because they were too hard to understand (as written) and I simply could not see the benefit in them, which I found to be a shame. (Perhaps that part is just my experience, but as an experienced gamer, I typically have little to no problem understanding how a game is meant to work, while this one perplexed me in many cases-- typically not a good sign.)  

To be fair and forthcoming, I have only played as the Agent so far (twice), but both times (against two hunters), I felt that it was much too difficult for the agent to remain hidden, forcing a quick reveal and confrontation in both cases, much too early for my liking.  This could just be my game group and specific instance, however, but I would be remiss in not saying how I felt about the perceived inability to hide long enough to make a decent shot at getting anywhere close to just the first objective marker and being half-dead that early in the game.  I am by no means a self-proclaimed expert at hidden movement games, but I am quite experienced with them (having played as Jack successfully in LfW multiple times, and Dracula in FoD a few times as well). So, when I was unable to get very far without being forced into a reveal in both our games, I felt as though the system favors the hunters ability to find and identify the Agent pretty early on.  Considering the Hunter's many abilities and location finding tools, I had a real sense that the Hunters could narrow down my position and deduce my possible location(s) with ease.  Either that, or my game group Hunters were just excellent/lucky (which is why I am still keen to play more).  While some may not see this as a problem, I do, since I feel it doesn't have long enough to build up a real sense of drama.  Again, further play may reveal that I am incorrect on this particular point, which I fully realize.  I am interested to know if others (who are experienced with hidden movement games) found a similar conclusion or not.       

I will report back when I have played more, with the hope that my current issues with the game will be resolved through more plays.  

For now, this is inferior to Letters from Whitechapel for me.

遊戲的亮點在於每個特務有不同的能力，而獵人並不知道是哪個特務出任務，特務擁有裝備卡可以混淆獵人的判斷，達到欺敵的效果~
而每個獵人也有不同的特殊能力，相互搭配的好，很容易可以找出特務的藏身點來攻擊，但這並不表示抓得到，因為特務使用裝備很具關鍵~
這個遊戲的另一個亮點是在於玩家人數的不同，有不同的遊戲方式，這個部分是我覺得這遊戲做的最好的地方，也就是平衡性，針對玩家人數所做出的平衡讓遊戲性大幅提升，在二~三人遊戲中任務是公開的，四人以上任務是隱藏的，五人更加入叛徒機制使雙方更有選擇以及更多考量~

Reminds me of the days when I played Clue: Museum Caper. I brought it to my friend's house, and out of 5 games, the concept made it an instant 'need to play'.

We played it, and the rules were easy to understand, and it was an instant win with my group. Simple concept, very fun and very cool. Will play again soon.

The only gripe is that it was a bit difficult for the agent to visualize last scene markers at times, but I think that just come with practice.

Hidden movement games need to end once you're discovered. Or have mechanisms for a sort of reset. As it stands the only real hidden movement game I've enjoyed was Letters from White Chapel. Once the agent is revealed this game devolves to dice rolling nonsense.

Very fun game! Each side has a different experience to it, which will appeal to different people. I had a good time on both sides, but think I prefer being the agent trying to slink around and outwit the hunters just slightly. Maybe the best part about being the agent is listening to the hunters wrack their brains trying to figure out where you're hiding out.

Game tip: Unless the hunters are REALLY putting the squeeze on you, don't be afraid to stay still every once in a while. If timed right, it really throws the hunters off kilter if they believe they have to expand their search area, because you somehow slipped through them.

Played my first game as the agent against my wife and adult daughter. Very tense and exciting! I won but only just and that was partially because my opponents forgot I only needed 3 of the 4 objectives. My daughter immediately wanted to play again and actually convinced my wife to do so which rarely happens. After the second game, my wife even said "next time we play, we should...". She never talks strategy after a game, so that tells you something. I'm looking forward to the next play. Would benefit from a tracking app.

Great, fast-paced hidden-movement game. Plays great with 2, though a little tough for the Raxxon player to win. I imagine it would swing wildly in their favor if playing with 4 players (3 hunters). Love all of the individualized powers. Great board and components, although the coords can be kinda hard to see.

I have only played once and as the Agent, for me it was a very fun experience but hunters had little chance to catch me and didn't look very fun from their point of view. Need to play a couple more times from both perspectives to give a final opinion. Update: I played again but as the hunter, had a lot of fun actually winning the game in two player. Very stressful experience on either side. Update: Sold due to wife not enjoying the game.

Played with traitor (5 player game) and it was hillarious. I was playing the bad guy and on one turn my accomplice just said that he accidently forgot to use his characters special ability. The other guys were really upset and mad at him and 1 round later he revealed himself as the traitor, and we both were laughing so hard :-)

Because he is a chemist and a very smart guy, and him pretending to have forgotten to use his special ability was just soooooooooooo epiiiiiiiiiiiiic lol

What an amazing experience, this game is great.

Specter Ops is a sci-fi, stealth ops game of hidden movement that's similar to Scotland Yard. Players are trying to locate/capture a mysterious agent, who keeps track of their sneaking via a private map. The other players take control of unique characters who must use their wits, abilities and technology to help them hunt down this infiltrator. Items like flash grenades, scanners, and the like are at the disposal of this covert agent.

I do not like the traitor mechanic in the 5 player version of the game.  It feels like it was tacked on unnecessarily and thoughtlessly in a poor effort to create balance.  The non-traitor version of the game is basically the same as any other hidden movement game and does not add much to make this substantively stand out to me.

Another in a series of "Scotland Yard" style games where a group are chasing a mystery figure who moves secretly and only occasionally reveals his/her location on the board.  This one has a few more bells and whistles than Scotland Yard and New York Chase and a few less than Letters from Whitechapel and Fury of Dracula (though more variations).  Solid game but not a particular standout in its genre.

Great game that really simplifies the hidden movement rules for the better, while also adding a great theme that really works well. The FAQ is a must-read, as there are a lot of situations that will come up during a game that are not explained, and the FAQ did a good job of answering all our questions as they came up. Quality of the components, board and cards are top notch. So good, in fact, that I want to paint all the miniatures. I think the game could really benefit from an expansion with a new map and note pad, at least, if not also new cards and maybe characters. The artist really did a great job, and I'd love to see him expand on his vision!

Great hidden movement game. It doesn't add much new to the genre, but it does what it does very well. As an added bonus, the board and minis are beautiful! Works great at 2 players and pretty well at 3. Four is too long and convoluted, and 5 adds a "traitor" element that simply isn't fun.

I would play this anytime as the Agent, as it is quite tense and difficult decisions to be made to try and outrun the Hunters.  I don't understand the cooperative aspect of the game and the traitor doesn't really add to the game as much as I'd like.  It's quite difficult to avoid being found by the hunters with a full complement of them.  I wonder if this might actually be best as a 2 player game, though you would lose the potentially amusing banter amongst the hunters as the Agent.  I see this as great fun for the Agent and mildly annoying logic puzzle for the Hunters.  The rules need clarification on some points and the game is overly fiddly/underdeveloped on a number of points.  Forty turns is a lot also, and there is a fair incentive for the Agent to wander to lose the Hunters at some point in the game--the game just can tend to outlast its welcome at 3+ hours.

This is a pretty clever hidden movement game. I've only played as the Agent so I'd like to see if playing as the Hunters changes my opinion of the game. As it stands, I enjoy it and I'm glad I own it.

Specter Ops is a decent hidden movement game that pits one vs the rest. The main issue with the game is that to have any chance of winning, players have to be familiar with the agent's cards. The board looks very nice, the components are excellent, yet the game isn't nearly as good as others of the hidden movement genre.

Awesome Hide n Seek game!  Our gaming group has had so much fun with this game, we've been playing multiple times a week!  IMO, while similar to Letter from White Chapel, this game is more fun and entertaining.  So many different characters, abilities, equipment cards, it's awesome.  I can't wait for the next expansion and new vehicles and map!

One last thing, this is an awesome experience for a 2, 3, 4 and 5 player game.  IMO, 4 players is the hardest version for the agent, but he can win, just takes a lot of thought and planning, and some luck!

Much less frustrating than Letters From Whitechapel. I like the Last Seen At mechanic because it lets you know which way he went, or that you're close, every few turns usually. As opposed to in LFW where you can go 45 minutes without finding Jack's trail, and by the time you do he's long gone. The advantage Specter Ops gives is that since the hunters are always close to the Agent, it's usually a pretty even race. In Whitechapel it's a much slower burn that doesn't really even out until close to the end. I dislike the ameritrash character abilities, but its a necessary evil in a game that is relatively even. Specter ops also has more options than LFW in that you can introduce a traitor mechanic. And most importantly, it doesn't overstay its welcome.

Look, this game is fun... FUN! I love the theme, I love the setting, I love the mechanics. Here’s the thing, I love it when the mechanics in a game make sense, and in this game, baby, they just make sense.

Pick your agent, but don’t show who they are until/if you get spotted. Brilliant! The equipment cards are a great idea, and their use is implemented well. I mean... it’s just FUN!

I feel like the various agents and hunters are well-balanced, the minis are well-crafted and pretty detailed, and there are hardly any components (very elegant execution).

I mean it’s not a perfect game, by any means; I think most people will be home brewing some rules regarding whether getting in/out of the car will end your turn, and there are going to be a few rule clarification checks here and there, but you’re going to have fun. 

Lastly, make sure you play with people you can trust. At the heart of this game is trust; you have to trust that the person who plays as the agent is going to be honest about whether they’ve been spotted or not.

Ya know... I don’t think I’ve ever won a game as a hunter.

Hmm...

This was the game where I painted minis for the first time.

Love the core mechanic of this game. As either a hunter or agent there is a great amount of tension as the game goes on, with the turn limit helping to keep things moving. Personally, I think the game lacks of little balance. Having played with several different groups of players; 3 players has the agent at an advantage, 4 players the hunters have the advantage. Doesn't stop the game from being enjoyable, but prevents a higher score.

RATING: 7
A solid hidden move game with a great theme. All of the rules are tight, picking a Runner/Hunter is genuinely difficult as they all feel useful and the miniatures are pretty good if a little bendy. It is essential for the Hunters to work as a team or they will definitely lose, so only play this with people who are comfortable with deduction games.

This is a great hidden movement game, and a big improvement over Letters from White Chapel. While it's not as good as EFTAIOS, Specter Ops has the big advantage of being an excellent game for two people, whereas EFTAIOS only really works for 4-8 people. It also doesn't take as long as Fury of Dracula, so it is a must for any gamer's collection that prefers Hidden Movement games as there are always times when you just can't get a big group together.

The best thing about this game is its balance. This is the most well-balanced Hidden Movement game around at this time that I'm aware of, with most games being very close affairs. This is because the Hunters have enough abilities to have a good idea of where the Agent is, so they are typically only a step or two behind. You can't really go into this game as the agent and expect to completely lose the hunters, the way you can in Fury or White Chapel. On the plus side, the Agent has enough gear to escape when they are found, making the game very tense and a considerable battle of attrition.

Its biggest weakness is its lack of variety, as there is only one board and one starting point. Having a variable map would have given this game much longer legs, but it's still compelling after a dozen playthroughs, especially as playing with 5 people essentially transforms it into a Hidden Role game as well. 

The final big weakness is the propensity for unintentional cheating, as the entire game hinges on the agent being able to give proper information to the hunters. Since all movement checks are done by the agent, an unexperienced player can easily spoil the entire game by accident even with the best intentions.

RATING: 7.5
Let me start with the "bad" things:

- I think it's way overpriced for what comes in the box... here in Europe I see it in online stores with prices from €41 to €51 and you get 1 Board(yes, it's a big board and has some cool details), 8 Player Large cards (4 hunters and 4 Agents), 8 very cool Mini's (4 Hunters and 4 Agents), some cardboard tokens, 4 secret role cards, 1 Vehicle card, 12 equipment cards, a Movement sheets pad and 2 dice...
I don't think there's enough things in the box for that price point... yes, I know it has 8 minis, still not enough for that price!

- I think that the Agents are in a clear disadvantage against the full complement of hunters... I still have to check the rules to see if we played something wrong but the Agents are pretty much powerless against the Hunters, they have very little ways of attacking then, and even if they are able to do it, being Stun doesn't make that big of a difference to the Hunters.

Remember, I'm talking about when there are all hunters in the game, even with one being a traitor... It was probably the fault of this session, but the agent got uncovered in the 3rd round, way to early and he was always pinned down for the entire game... 

When I got revealed has the traitor I choose the Orangutan and was able to stun the other 3 Hunters in one move giving some breathing room to the original Agent, but after using my Power Fists twice there was nothing more for me to do but escape... if I stayed in the game I couldn't do anything more... maybe if the Traitor could complete Mission also that would spice things up, because that would force the Hunters to split up a bit and not be so overwhelming in the trail of the original Agent...

I think the game would be better if when the Traitor got uncovered he could also complete missions, but in this case all 4 missions would have to be completed... maybe add something more to be done to make the job a little harder...

The way it is, like I said, I got uncovered at round 7, in that moment I used my Power Fists and Stunned 2 Hunters (one of them was already stunned), in the Round 8 I stunned all 3 Hunters and after that I had nothing more to do because I couldn't use the Power Fists any more and there's no way to attack the Hunters... so I just had to escape... and I did it in Round 12... the game ended in Round 28, so I got to play less than half the game!
The Hunters didn't have to worry about me... I had no meaning to them because for them it doesn't matter if I escape or if they catch me or if I stay in play, it's irrelevant, and that, to me it's pretty bad for any game, to have a player that will only be useful for 2 or 3 rounds and then he really can't do anything else...

This was the major let down for me... but of course, this only happens in a 5 player game where one of the Hunters is a Traitor and he gets discovered...

But like I said, I'll have to check the rules to see if we missed something, but I don't think so, no one is infallible, but when it comes to rules and game explanation I don't think there's anyone I trust more than Dugy 

What I liked about the game... the guessing and double guessing of the movement... the trying to get in the other players head to predict what they are trying to do.

The stress the Agent is put to trying to complete the mission and escape the grasp of the Hunters is awesome, hearing what moves they are thinking of making, hearing the discussion...

The game has a great potential, but I think it's heavily skewed towards the Hunters at least in the 5 player game... can't judge when it's a 2, 3 or 4P game...

I feel that my first play, playing as a hunter, left me at a disadvantage due to the fact I was going in without any real knowledge of the game. I had no idea what other possible abilities the spy could have which made some of his moves seem almost unfair. It was a mildly frustrating experience this first time. I think as I play more and especially if I play as the spy, I will enjoy the game more.

Great-great game. Takes the best part of the Fury of Dracula (tracking the sneaky count), gets rid of random boring combat mechanic, adds a great theme and flavorful characters from both sides. And the gameplay is never dull in this game, if you know what you are doing.

Hidden movement game with a ton of flavor and Amerithrash mechanics add some theme. Having issues getting it to the table as it is competitive head-to-head which doesn't see a lot of play given my limited opponent pool.

This game doesn't mess around and gets right into the action.  Good tension throughout.

Two-player game (agent vs. 2 hunters) feels perhaps too weighted in favor of the agent.

RATING: 8.5
After playing this, I realize that hidden movement may be one of my favorite mechanics. I'm enthralled by one person sneaking around and enjoying a laugh while the other team screams back and forth where he may be. They point at a spot while yelling "He has to be here, because I can see here, you can see there and the rest is covered by the wolf's smell... unless you're the traitor." But in reality, the agent has used a piece of equipment to sneak past the line of sight.

The traitor aspect makes the game so different. He/she has to act like they are helping the cause, while really thinking in the back of their mind how to let the agent move freely and still participate. It's a mind game that works to create tension, while also creating extra time playing the game, which at times is a downer.

But the powers, the equipment, the car, the minis, the colors on the board. Awesome, awesome awesome. Hoping I can more plays and try other hidden movement games.

Hidden movement games never really worked with the majority of people I play with, which is a shame, because I'm really good at them. :D
Specter Ops is a nice version of such games, with the inclusion of special equipment and different player powers.
I ended up painting the miniatures and selling the game, never having played my own copy.

It’s another of the many takes of the classic [thing=438]Scotland Yard[/thing]. In this case, the “assassin” only needs to hit 3 targets and to cover his tracks, instead of having different methods of transport at his disposal, he can use several items and powers that are unknown to the hunters. The hunters also have some powers on their side.

The components are nice, except the board. It’s too dark and its features might not be easily seen under certain light conditions. Also, the possible targets are not marked in any way.

The rules have been distilled to provide an elegant gameplay with a game length that is ideally short. And they work. Our games were tense enough. It features a traitor mechanic for 5 players I have not tried.

There are very few games I would rate a 10, but this is one of them. It's just perfect. Run time is great, each character has their own abilities, and every turn is an edge of your seat sweat show. Both sides cause stress, especially as the agent, as you're always trying to dodge your opponents, and have a limited, but just the right amount of abilities. I can't say enough about this game. I'd play it every week with my group if they'd let me.

I was so in love with this game when I first got it, but it is sadly starting to lose stock in my book.  Maybe I just need to play it more and with more than just two players.  I know it is quicker and lighter than Fury of Dracula, but I would play that game in a heartbeat over this one if I wanted a hidden movement/deduction/combat game.  If I didn't have time to play Fury, I am starting to feel like I would rather play a different kind of game over Specter Ops.  Maybe it is just burn out because I played it so much when I first got it - which illustrates the point I try to make when I get teased over growing my collection so much and so fast.  I want variety and choice so no game gets tarnished in my eyes.

Good thematic game with hidden movement mechanic. Problem with hidden movement is requires a good player to play the agent or will ruin experience for everybody since the group can't check for mistakes. This makes introducing it to inexperienced gamers more problematic. Expected companion app should help with this problem with and make it more approachable. Role of hunters easier, but not as much fun. Screaming for expansion.

Fairly pure hidden movement game where an agent tries to steal secrets from a Raxxon facility and two or more hunters tries to stop the agent.

The agent enters on a predetermined space and has to capture three out of four objectives spread over the map. Equipment cards like smoke grenades and stealth fields are available for help in evading the hunters.

The hunters use their own abilities and the motion sensor equipped car to track and corner the agent. This requires teamwork since the hunters differing abilities complement each other in various ways.

When playing with a fifth player, one hunter is secretly a traitor that works with the agent. Haven't tried this one yet.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Fun game with lots of variability, three player experience is just okay with the Hunters knowing where the objective tokens are after two successful objectives the third is very difficult to obtain. Game opens up and plays better with 4 people and I would recommend playing it this way to begin with. 2 plays in, Hunters wrecked the agent in 3 player and Agent escaped with 1 HP in the 4 player game. I do have concerns that some agents are better than others. *cough cough* Cobra *cough cough*

This game is like playing hide and go seek with special asymmetrical powers. One player plays the spy, and has to get in and out of the complex without being killed by the other players. The spy records his movement on a paper sheet, so the players only get to see him on the board when they actually find him. With 5 players, one player is also secretly a traitor which was interesting. The spy gets to know who the traitor is, and gets to lie about if the traitor sees him or not. This game is great fun, but we had a ton of rules questions throughout the game. The rulebook is not nearly enough. Not even close. Thank god for BGG rules forums. Otherwise this wouldn't be remotely playable.

The Hidden movement game turned stealth action, with close-pressed prey and deadly hunts.

The game scales magnificently, with two and three player games being simple cat and mouse games, four players being an intensive version with three hunters and a beefed up agent, and then the five player game become an insane game with four hunters (including a traitor) and a 2-3 player version of the hunter, and some tough times.

With full players, the traitor mechanic in many ways works out in a way where the traitor is more just that one incompetent security guard who doesn't realize that weird Orangutan they keep seeing is an enemy agent, and when they get caught in the act, they decide it's better to just join the rebels than get fired from their job.

Being the agent always feels like a blast to me, but it seems that sometimes individual hunters can have a bad time.

I have played this game about 5 times. I can't say that I have had any amazing games of this, only great moments in those games. Out of an hour long game, maybe 10 minutes of that game is exciting. There could be some dynamic that could be better maybe with certain groups. But I haven't found that group yet. I am still feeling this game out but it just hasn't met all the hype for me. It's just not my kind of game. This isn't to say its a bad one, I would just rather play other games. Because of this I traded it in the Jan. '17 Math Trade.

Another Scotland Yard, Whitechapel, Fury of Dracula-ish hidden movement deduction game, this time with a cool sci-fi theme (big guns, cyborg apes, spider spies, smoke grenades!)

Honestly, this is pretty fun. There is a good balance between the opposing teams and lots of meaningful choices to be made. Very tense cat-and-mouse action where the tides can turn at the drop pf a hat. My rating would be higher if I felt the gaming world needed another title like this. Specter Ops is probably one of the better ones, but maybe it's too little to late for this genre.

Played this two player with wife and was a lot of fun! Can get very tense at times! Played three player with friends and just as fun. However messed up on some rules. If you're going to play, make sure you know all the rules as they can hinder or help the agent a LOT!

UPDATE: The agent almost always wins in my group. He is always found and we always get a few hits in but time and time again the agent wins consistently. 

Does not work well for younger kids.

RATING: 8
28-06-2015. Rated after 1 play. Specter Ops is a fun hidden movement game in which one player plays an Agent, trying to hit several objectives while hiding and escaping the persecuting Hunters.

The Agent starts at 1 location. He then can move up to 4 spaces and has several hidden items. At the start of the game it is unknown who the Agent is and what kind of special abilities and items s/he possesses. 

The Hunters each move 4 spaces.. and there is a car they can move with. Hunters have LOS in orthogonal directions, and each time the hunter moves through their field of view he leaves a token. If you ever 'find' the Hunter, you can attack him relentlessly and kill him.

The game is fun. It's a more thematic -but less thinky- Clue/Letters game. I like it. The special powers make it interesting as does the uncertainty what the Agent has. Fun. Nice components. Want to buy.

Played this game 4 times with my son and we played the game as 2-player but I think this game is meant for larger group. I also find that it is easy to forget to put the last seen token after the agent is moved and it will mess up the game quite a bit. When my son was the agent, I had to remind him every tern if he was seen, but then he would, sometime, give away where he is.

A more high octane (spastic?) Hidden movement game that I've really started to like. It's like the last bits of Whitechapel where you're right on Jack's tail protracted into an entire game. The last seen mechanism coupled with the equipment cards allows for some harrowing escapes and really intense moments, and all the special powers feel appropriately awesome/broken.
Unfortunately the rules are full of more holes and ambiguities than the plot of Prometheus. Zing!

Sits between Fury of Dracula (crazy, power oriented) and Letters of Whitechapel (pure deduction puzzle), because it has a little bit of craziness in the way of powers and die rolls but is also very static and predictable compared to Fury of Dracula

Seems to work OK, but I think a bit of soul is lost here compared to Fury of Dracula, which is the high watermark for me.

RATING: 5
A neat concept, but there isn't much game there for me. One player will barely use the board and pieces at all and instead be preoccupied with a piece of paper. The game seems made for two, but doesn't work well as there is little interaction for most of the game. With three players, it is more enjoyable, but not by much.

I had a positive review, but repeated plays of the game made me think of it as a game that is good mechanically...but is not fun to play. It all comes down to calculations and probabilities where the Agent is.

Team-based hidden movement deduction game.  One player plays an agent trying to maneuver across a large board while the other players attempt to hunt him down.  Plays like a less-dry, but higher-variance Letters to Whitechapel.  One thing that would have helped is a key that has a description of all the agent player's possible power cards.

RATING: 8
It's is similar to Letters From Whitechapel, yet different enough to make it worth owning both. It's fun and the powers and equipment add some nice variety to the game. In my opinion, Whitechapel is still the better game of this type, but this game is nice and easy to teach, so it's great for newer players.

RATING: 7
I was pleasantly surprised by this game.  This is a hidden movement/chase game much like Scotland Yard, Letters from Whitechapel, and Nuns on the Run.  I'm not usually a fan of these sorts of games but the inclusion of asymmetric powers and special equipment elevated this one for me.

The basics are pretty much the same as those other games.  An agent sneaks around a large board by keeping track of his movement on a hidden sheet of paper.  His goal is to activate 3 of 4 targets and escape the facility within 40 turns.  The other players are all trying to kill him or delay him before he can accomplish his tasks.

Each agent and hunter has their own special abilities.  The agents are usually simple and unimpressive compared to the hunters but the agent also starts with special equipment that improve his abilities but these have a limited number of uses.  This presents one of the really important decision trees in the game, when to use and when to save this equipment.  If you blow it all early then the second half of the game becomes really tough with nothing left up your sleeve.  But if you are too frugal with them you could find yourself dead with a set of unused cards.

The rules for being spotted, line of sight, and the vehicle all add up to a neat collection of criteria that each side can play around or manipulate to their own advantage.  This really felt like a game of balanced mind games where outsmarting your opponent(s) was really important as opposed to similar games that can really just feel like they boil down to lucky guessing.

The board is also gorgeous and the miniatures are really nice.  The only minor complaint I have about the components is that the vehicle is represented on the map by a token when it could have easily also been a miniature.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Pretty disappointed with this game. It's certainly not a bad game, but unless you're the hidden player, there's not a lot going on for the first half of the game or so. The game could literally be half finished with the agent player never being seen.

I like the special ability cards, I like the miniatures, I like the theme, I like hidden movement games. Unfortunately this one checked off a lot of the boxes but still ended up dry and somehow didn't deliver. 

Can't say it's a bad game though. Well thought out and streamlined. Would rather play other games though.

Components are slightly above average - mounted board, thick cardboard tokens, unpainted plastic miniatures and marginally durable character cards and cards.

This game really nails the vibe, and is nicely streamlined. Playing the agent requires someone familiar with the rules and able to visualize line of sight zones. 

As I understand the LOS rules, an diagonally adjacent agent is not in LOS, which surprises people a bit. But other than that, it's a solid intuitive system.

I played as the agent the first game.  Both of my kids wanted to play as  the agent next so I guess it is a keeper.  Any game that my teenage son wants to play is a keeper at this point as he no longer asks to play board games.  

I was able to escape with 1 round left and both hunters were on my heels.  Might run a little longer than I would like but it was our first game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Super solid, great mechanics, a lot of fun.  Requires a lot of teamwork on the hunter side.  Hunter powers might need a little more usage to fully understand possibilities, but that's no different than executing solid play of any game with asymmetrical powers.

Spectre Ops is a straightforward hidden movement game. It's slick, it works, but it doesn't really do anything especially noteworthy with hidden movement mechanics. This isn't a bad thing! The game plays quite well and the line-of-sight system does create a different tactical challenge than, say, Escape from the Aliens in Outer Space or Letters from Whitechapel. It just means that I'd usually rather be playing another hidden movement game if I can manage to get a group big enough for Captain Sonar or a group patient enough for the extra length and rules load of Letters from Whitecapel and Fury of Dracula.

It's a rather beautiful game, though I wish the grey minis were printed cardboard standees instead. I'm not a painter and they look so grey and sad next to the other lovely components.

tl;dr: fine, but I'm not sure I'm in to this genre

I'd never played any of these games like [thing=438][/thing] and stuff, so this was my first game in this genre. I must say it works pretty well and it had some tense moments. A small mistake or guess can really screw you over, so each decision is crucial. It felt like it was challenging for both sides.
But it did stay out it's welcome. We didn't play all that slow. There where some turns that could have been a bit faster, but overall we played at a reasonable pace, and 3 hours is just too long.
But after playing this I have to say that while I appreciate the game, I'm not convinced this is my style of game and I don't feel inclined to check out the other titles.

Initial rating: 6.5/10

RATING: 3
Hmm. With 4 players (so 3 hunters) is this at all winnable for the agent? It didn't seem it in two plays (all very experienced gamers). Running from the outset is a losing proposition as a quick scan will reveal which half of the board you are in and walking means that, with the car, the hunters can be on you in 2 turns. This, like far too many Plaid Hat games, felt massively underdeveloped. Our second agent used all of his cards to achieve one objective - we went for 23 turns and he was 1/4 of the way through his goals. And 23 turns is about 10 too many for this game. Poor.

Specter Ops is a really unique game.  It does the hidden movement masterfully.  I love the variety of agents and hunters.  The 4 player game seems near impossible for the agent.  I wonder how the 5 player game would work with a traitor hunter.

I think this would be best with 2 players, because the hunters really need to work as one and you don't necessarily need other people controlling them.  It actually gave me a very similar feeling to Tragedy Looper.  Great game.

I'm a big fan of hidden movement / 1 vs all games / traitor games, so I was destined to enjoy this one.  Still, it falls below Fury of Dracula and Lords of Waterdeep.  I just didn't enjoy the setting or aesthetic nearly as much, and that does make a big difference for me.

RATING: 7
Game seems great so far. Unlike some other deduction games, this is equally as fun to play for both the agent and the hunters. As the agent you really feel like you're sneaking around, and as the hunters you're always trying to trap the agent, wondering if you're hot on his trail or if he double-backed to throw you off.

Unfortunately it seems pretty hard to win as the agent. The agent has to play almost perfectly plus have some good luck, whereas the hunters just need to play competently. A poll here on BGG also suggests that the hunters win most games.

Compared to something like Scotland Yard, the relatively smaller board really helps make the game fun for the hunters. In Scotland Yard you really just wonder around and slowly close in on the enemy, with it not getting tense until the last few turns. In Specter Ops the hunters make a couple of moves, use some abilities to narrow down the agent's location, and in just a couple of turns you're chasing him down.

Right now the only issue I have is with a number of rules ambiguities. There is already an FAQ, but for any new players here are a few things to keep in mind that can be hard to find or just hard to remember.

My rating could be even higher because I like the core game a lot, but the rules issues and balance in favor of the hunters is keeping this a little further down for now.

[b]RULES REMINDERS/AMBIGUITIES[/b]:

1. [b]The motion sensor[/b].
  a. If the car moves at all during any of the hunter turns during a single round, you can't use the motion sensor at all during that hunter round. Similarly, if you used the motion sensor, you can't move the car at all during the hunter turns that round.
  b. A hunter has to start his turn inside the car in order to use the motion sensor. Meaning you can't get into the car and then activate the sensor on the same turn.

2. [b]Stun[/b]. A stunned hunter can only be moved up to two spaces on his turn and can't attack or use special abilities.

3. [b]Post-cognition[/b]. If the agent's most recent move was written on turn 5, then he will read where he was on turn 3.

4. [b]The Gun[/b]. When rolling two dice, The Gun only misses if both dice are 1's. If any single die shows a 6, that die gets rerolled and added to the total.

And there are more. These are mostly situational, but it still feels like a lot to keep in mind for what is otherwise a pretty simple game.

Overall, great game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Note : I have only had the chance to play the agent both time with 4 and 5 players so can not tell you what it is like a hunter at the minute.

As the agent, this game is awesome but hard when you have 4 players and a first time traitor. In the 4 player game its somewhat alittle easier to play but still you need to plan ahead and understand where the hunter could go in the next few turns.

very fun game.

I only purchased Specter Ops because it was on clearance for $25 and Barnes & Noble. I hadn't heard great things about the game, and have two other hidden movement games on pre-order (The Last Friday and Fury of Dracula).

Maybe the low expectations helped, but I've played a game as both the Agent and as a Hunter and have really enjoyed Specter Ops. 

It's pretty quick to teach and seems overly simplistic on the surface, but the variable player powers add quite a few wrinkles to the constant cat-and-mouse game that takes place.

It'll be fun to see how this compares to our experiences with The Last Friday and Fury of Dracula and which of the games stay in my collection for the long haul.

Played at Geek & Sundry's Tabletop Day with the designer, then bought it.  Great hidden movement game. After 6 or 7 plays I can say it's a very solid game with nice SF theme.  I wish there were more the Agent could do to fight back, but otherwise a lot of fun if you like hunting or being hunted, ala Fury of Dracula/Letters from Whitechapel.

Fun game... but more fun to play as the agent than as a hunter I think, feels pretty tense.

RATING: 5
Specter Ops is a hidden movement find-the-guy game like Scotland Yard or Letters from Whitechapel. This game is a little different because there are roles with special abilities and the spy (the guy you want to find) has some special equipment that let's him do stuff. There's also a car, which lets you zip around the board, and can trigger a compass reading off the spy.

I liked the theme more than LfWc. I'd rather not delve into Jack the Ripper/violent sex crimes territory if I can help it. And the board for SO is simply beautiful.

The game does what it does well. But as it turns out, the whole tracking down a hidden guy genre isn't one that I enjoy that much. Amusingly, I think the only game I still own from when I was a kid is Scotland Yard... which was specifically a game given to me, and which, famously, no one would ever play with me. So I have a bit of nostalgia for the genre... but I just don't find the process of tracking down the spy that interesting. I suspect being the spy is more fun, but again, it's not the type of thing that is going to thrill me. I like building things, setting up an engine and having cool turns where you make a mega-turn and do a ton of stuff. The whole "Oh, we almost got him!", "He's on the run!", "Oh no, he slipped away!" etc. just isn't that fun for me.

I can't really put a score on this one but I will mention that I have played this with kids of age 6 and 8. They both make good use of tactics and find it fun and challanging. When I did this I took out the special abilities of all characters. It was enough with the rest. It seemed balanced enough to have a casual game anyway.

The included paper to draw your secret moves are a very good tool.

RATING: 7
Preliminary rating based on expectations that 3-player and eventually 5-player is better than 4-player (or that 4-player can be balanced better with minor house-ruling).

First plays:
4-player seemed impossibly difficult for the agent. Unless we were useless as agents and/or too good as hunters, surely the agent needed even more equipment to have a decent chance?
Rating: 5-6

Second play:
Much, much better with 3 players - actually, good fun which we all enjoyed. Close game which could have gone either way.
Rating: 7

Third play:
Return to the 4-player game and it was much better than the first play. As a third-time agent, managed to activate all necessary tree targets and heading for the exits before getting cut off and killed.

With a few plays of experience, the agent probably has a small advantage in 3-player games; the hunters probably have a small advantage in 4-player games.

Very interesting after 1 game (5players), still very good after 2nd game (3 players), but 8/10 is probably all that game can earn. Maybe I'm wrong but it's very possible that each game session (although boardgame with many fields seems to provide many choices) is quite similar. Don't get me wrong, each game will be unique (different characters, different equipment cards, freedom of movement) but I suppose in each game session the same playing scheme will appear: quite hidden agent movement in one of ~4 regions of boardgame and hunter's awaiting for "sudden" agent's pass through the street to a next region. I would like to convince myself in next games that I'm wrong. I see some salvation for this issue in playing with full team i.e. 5 players, when one of the player is traitor which can totally confuse real hunters.

Played 3 times all 4p. Fun with the right group. 

My experience was pretty soured with an agent who declared "why should i go straight to bomb the sites when i have 40 turns?" He spent many turns moving just 1-2 spaces a turn so our vehicle couldn't detect him and doing random movements like walking back to the beginning of the map. Compared to our earlier game, the agent cleared the map in 16 turns. Our game with him, he only got the first bomb site at turn 16.

I think we need to house rule the game to 25 turns max to prevent this sort of behavior. Its a real drag hearing "nothing is detected", "no one has line of sight" and " "you dont smell anything" for an hour+.

This game is an insta-buy for me when it comes out. What an amazing experience it was to play at BGG Con. The strategy and theme just come alive as soon as you start playing. And if you are playing with admirable foes you will be kept on your feet the whole time.

The game is like Letters from Whitechapel but with a Sci-Fi/Fantasy theme. Also in Specter-Ops characters have special abilities allowing them to conduct special actions or have certain actions happen when a sequence plays out.

If you love deduction/hidden movement games buy this. You will not be disappointed. Even if you hate the them, this game is essentially pure deduction with some additional strategic elements to enjoy.

My only play of Specter Ops was probably not at an optimal player count: 2. It was a game of cat-and-mouse as my friend traipsed around while my hunters tried to find him. It ended up being mostly me learning how to find him and what to do at that point, but I could see this game having an alpha gamer problem as the hunters try to find the agent. I’d like to try this one again, but I was a little disappointed by it.

A good little deduction game that doesn't overstay it's welcome. It does feel like it is missing a few layers, a little more depth to the combat would be nice. Expansion possibilities?

Sci-fi mutants in a hidden grid movement deduction race. The secret agent tries to avoid being cornered by a team of hunters while capturing mission objectives and making a clean get away. Fury of Dracula is the standard for our group but this game does a couple things that we like better. First off, this game doesn't drag us through a cumbersome combat system, hooray. We also like that secret choosing from the agents and both sides secretly picking equipment creates wonderful buildup and surprise during the chase and confrontations. Shorter play time is a bonus created from the hunters knowing that the agent has to get to areas of the board to complete missions. Throw in a traitor with five players. Specter Ops doesn't replace Fury of Dracula, there is the right mood for both.

Great theme, cool design. Really tactile game where the concept is clear and consistently tense and exciting. Rules need a redo, and errata is almost necessary. Always spend way too much time googling or negotiating rules.

Would like this to hit the table more. Great board and theme. One-versus-many game where a runner tries to accomplish goals before the hunters track him down. Some of the movement and shooting rules require a bit of explanation, but the game is actually quite simple. Fun on the first play.

Tjuv och polis was one of my favorite games as a kid, and 20 years later, playing Specter Ops is a fantastic update to that experience. Being the hunted is so tense! Would have loved to see another map and some more Agents and Hunters, though.

What I like:
-The game's visuals are excellent.  The artwork is well drawn and fitting for the theme and gameplay.  The graphic layout adds to the simplicity of the rules and makes the agent's job of hidden movement easier.
-The game has incredibly dynamics and keeps players on their toes.  The pace can pick up incredibly fast.
-Having multiple hunters and agents with unique, asymmetric abilities adds a lot to the replayability.
-Winning with a lucky Sniper Shot!!!

What I don't like:
-Before they first spot the agent, the game can feel slow for the hunters.
-There are many rule intricacies.  Even after watching the Watch It Played video and going through the rules, we had to reference the rules often our first game.

TL;DR
Fantastic game!  If you like asymmetric, tactical games or games that will keep you on your toes, play Specter Ops!

1st play. Good game. Had situation where the game got less interesting for a bit as the hunters stayed stationary and burned rounds until the agent was finally forced to move. Very viable strategy - but it's boring. Game ended due to round count. Would be interested in playing again. Definitely a few really tense moments.

Played a couple times with the wife. It was definitely a little more simple than I originally had expected. It felt like the Agent side is definitely where all the fun is with the hunters going through the motions to get it down to the escape where they finally have a chance.

Decent hidden movement game, Fury of dracula is better, but I can get this in with half of the time commitment.

I have two plays of this and already think it might get repetitive over time, but it is a very solid game. Might be more fun with a group more into deduction games than mine. There is some depth in the character and equipment selection that could come into play with expert players that might add a layer of fun that I didn't find with newbies.

In a world where Letters from Whitechapel and Fury of Dracula exist, I have no idea why anyone would ever play Specter Ops.  The game is 90% ruined by diagonal movement rules and 10% ruined by terrible board design.

I enjoyed playing as the agent. I managed to evade capture, it was close though. The game was a bit long for what it is. I found that my turns took a good while shorter than the hunters and there were times I wished I was playing something with less down time.

I got a chance to play this at GenCon. I am getting more and more excited about it actually releasing. This is my first introduction to hidden movement games, and I truly think that Emerson (the designer) has created something that will set the bar for all that come after.

Played with 4 and 5 players so far. Hunters won both times. We house ruled the traitor as being able to complete objectives. I would love the chance to play 2 or 3 players. Great game!

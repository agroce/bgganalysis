GAME: 1862: Railway Mania in the Eastern Counties
RANK: 2326

RATING: 10
One Railway to rule them all, One Railway to find them,
One Railway to bring them all and in the fenland bind them
In the Land of East Anglia where King RÃ¦dwald lies.

One of the best and most complicated of the 18xx family of games.  The rule book is not exactly an example of lucid expository prose, but once you plow through it the game is a delight.

Different in significant ways from vanilla 18xx. It is pure joy to construct a company which can efficiently utilize the three train types (freight, local, express).

Given the huge selection of companies and the permutations available via mergers, it is hardly possible for games to develop along well-trodden paths.

This may not be the first 18xx title you buy.  But it MUST be one of them.

Played in late prototype stage, will be interested once it's all finalised, Mike Hutton always adds some interesting quirks to the system. Can't see myself enjoying this with more than 4 players though even though they tried playtesting with 8!

12/26/16: Got this to the table for the first time.  There's a lot that's very different from other 18xx games. 
1) 3 different types of trains which can each use the track once.  
2) Random draw of companies determines starting position. 
3)Tiles tend not to be able to add connections so there is a lot of blocking by tile laying. 
4) The ability to buy warranties on your engines to guarantee running (1s and 4s come with 1 warranty. 
5) ability to refinance by losing 1/2 of the shares.
6) Home city specific tokens and rules
7) Supposedly plays well with 2, which is different than most 18xx.
8) Relatively small map.

Your first gameplay is mind melting.  I think that there are so many different things going  on here that it's not for novices.  The three different types of trains are each run very differently.  The variable starting companies guarantees a lot of replayabiity.  There are a lot of rules that are different than most 18xx games.  The person who taught the game had 19 plays, and we still did some stuff incorrectly.  I think that if I had another 100 plays of 18xx under my belt this would be a lot more appealing because there is so much unique here.  I think that after another 2-3 plays I'll enjoy it much more because its going to take that much to get basic competency going.

First play was 2 hours of rules, followed by 5 hours of gaming.  Repeated play or faster players should bring that down to 3-4 hours.

Plays well with 4.

Another interesting variant on the 1830 standard. I particularly enjoyed the different train types; the merger and receivership mechanics also seemed to promise interesting strategies, but we weren't experienced enough to take advantage of them.

The game also seemed not to be as cutthroat as for example 1830 can be. The stock market isn't too harsh, train progression seemed amiable enough (though we didn't really push this anywhere near as much as we could have) and there isn't as much stress from trains rusting. The map, though small, is also mostly peaceful, with plenty of tiles, though token positioning can be aggressive. In that sense it can also be a good change of pace from the silly take that moves we sometimes do in other games.

Overall I quite enjoyed it, even if we took overlong to finish, and would like to play again.

Complex game, even for someone who has played more than 15 different 18XX-games. But after a long explanation, the game plays pretty fluent. Some good ideas like the different trains are less complex than at first sight. Also the last set of operationrounds after buying the first H-train is a good way to end the game. Mostly after the last kind of train had been bought the game becomes boring and mostly not that much changes anymore. So here the end is clear and tight.

UPDATE - [2016] Had a chance to play a 3P F2F game.  I finished last.  My opponents were able to get multiple trains into their companies and those shares were paying out more money in the early-mid game, as opposed to my company that had a single train.  A miscalculation as to where I thought one of my opponent's would lay track delayed the merger of two companies, which would have helped get the resulting company more trains.  I am big fan of Mike Hutton 18xx designs, and have continued to be fascinated by 1862/EA's design space.  Wish I could play more of this one.

NIS

6.19.14 - One F2F play back in November of 2013.  The merging mechanic of companies; Interplay of 3 different train types; Ability to triple jump in stocks due; No Y tracks in the tile manifest; Tactical Tokening everywhere; High Replayability.  So many variables working together to create a rich/robust game experience that will feel different everytime.

Initial impressions:

A lot of chrome/superficial complexity which might either accentuate a brilliant design or obfuscate a tepid one.  It appears to be quite a short game, possibly handicapping its own flexible structures and minimizing their potential use.

It seems to be a 5-6 SR game with the game being already finished by the time the last set or two of ORs comes along.

With repeat play, there could be interesting paths here and it could go as high as a 10, or the superficial chrome could be stripped away and I might modify down to a 3.  I'm expecting somewhere in the 7-9 range.


12-2-13:

Rating increased to a 9, looks like it will land in the 8-10 range now.

After a few plays, we are beginning to open up the options for this, starting to see strategic potentials in refinancing and merger tricks (like deliberately refinancing a 30% company to pump a permanent train in then merge it into an existing company; or taking a good/big/expensive company with 30% and starting a new company at $54, buying 100% then merging and buying the option for ~$60 - now you have 7 shares of a really good company for the price of 5-6, with extra capital injection and a new permit).

The map is incredibly dense, with the largest wealth in the southeast.  I think we have collectively not been starting enough companies, and our track development has suffered a bit as a result - at game end (all nationalization events), there are usually only 2 brown Ns, 2 green Ns, 1 brown Y, and maybe 1 brown splat.  Everything else is green and yellow.  Huge map implications with nearly every tile laid, especially in the early game.  The N tile closest to London seems the primary chokepoint of the game.

Really short game - all "normal" games are lasting 5 SRs including the LNER one.  Taking about 4-5 hours, likely to become 3-4 with more practice.  Nearly the number of interesting decisions of 1817 in a denser space.

Preliminary rating: 8.  After 3 plays, I'm still just beginning to explore this game.  It's been said that 1862 is like a hand grenade with the pin pulled - it's going to explode; you just don't know when.  So far, that's been my experience with our group playing tentatively and cautiously.  With aggressive players, I expect trains to run no more than twice before rusting (and possibly not even once).

Notable Differences:

1. No train shenanigans: companies have to buy trains from each other and either full or half price.
2. Double, triple, quadruple jumps. no half-pays
3. Companies are either full cap or partial cap. Full cap companies involve an auction for the right to start them. Everyone gets to start a full cap auction until they win won. Full caps companies are all decided before the SR which means before you can start a partial cap company.
4. Routes need to connect and at least one route must include your home station.
5. You can reuse trach and cities, but each city only gets to count once.
6. Each company has a permit that says which one of the three train types it can run. The only way to get more is to merge. 
7. The three train types: Express (normal train, skips towns, can run to off-board locations, but no red-red or blue-blue runs), Local (normal train, includes towns but don't count against city limit, can't run to off-board locations, +10 into the company for each hex the local traverses), Freight (hex train (doesn't count one station), can run to off-board but not red-red or blue-blue, count starting and ending city and +20 for crow fly hexes in between (+30 if an end point is a port))
8. Non-permanent freight trains must run end-to-end and only count the the endpoints (like a single freight train). If more than one train is involved can run red-red or blue-blue.
9. Emergency train buy - can't use personal money. Must either sell company shares for full price or recapitalize (players trade in shares 2:1). That reminds me, selling shares for trainless companies are worth half (but not for an emergency train buy). 
10. Mergers happen either at the start or the end of a company's turn. Share price is the sum of the lower company plus half the higher company's share price. If either company is trainless, their share price is half what is shown. Players trade in shares 2:1, tokens are replaced from unused stock).
11. Director's shares can be sold sending companies to receivership. Players can own up to 100%
12. Game ends either by bank breaking, company hitting $1000 share value, or the first H train being bought. $100 share ends at the end of the current OR. Bank breaking ends at the set of ORs. H train finishes the current set of ORs, has one more SR, and then one more set of 3 ORs (no tile laying/token placing and trains must be bought from the bank). 
13. Trains can come with warranties. A and D come with one each by default. You lose one warranty per train at the end of its operations (excluding the turn you buy it). As long as a train has warranties, it's doesn't rust away. However, rusted trains do disappear as soon as the last warranty goes away.
14. Companies can drop tokens in other companies' home. If a company can't place a token (even by upgrading a tile), it can't start. When a company starts, it buys its tokens (full cap companies always get 3 for $60/token, partial cap companies choose from between 2 and 7 for $40/token).
15. Observations: train rush can be brutal (especially with 4). This is a game of high dividends plus high share value. Quadruple jumps give you a good chance to catch up, but you want your holdings to be near the top of the chart by the end of the game. Companies vary in importance based on what type of train they have and where their home is. Mergers are key to getting train types right and moving money around.

Tentative rating.  Explosive and short -- should readily collapse to a sub-3 hour game.  There is more to the progressive collapse of mergers than may be apparent here.  It is certainly a game which has figured out where its towel is.

Update: But, excessively fiddly and laden with wee margins and details, and filled with False Decisions and make work.  Rating dropped a point to 6.0

Update: Dropped once more to 5.0.  Sadly, another variety of 18xx-the-eurogame.

While all 18XX bring something new to the table, the amount of new systems that 1862 brings with it is huge. First,there is the highly variable starting set up, with no privates, only public companies with the 3 possible type of permits they may have. The Parliment round, with its new way of starting a public company is quite different as well and the new train types feel somewhat familiar, but are not really.
There's a lot to wrap your mind around in this game and, what felt like it would be a long game by reading the rules, ends up being quite short (for an 18XX, that is), with our first game finishing in a mere 4 hours.
Will hit the table again,that's for sure. Looking forward to playing, with perhaps the full correct rules this time

There is a great deal of naturally-generated variety stemming from the random selection of companies and the random assignment of train permits.  I have less experience with the games from this branch of the 18xx family (I think 1860 is closest, but it still is not all that close) and the decisions are different but interesting.  It also looks like it's going to be a short game.  I'm almost sure our group will get it down under 3 hours and maybe close to 2 hours.

I also think this game is quite accessible to beginners.  The differences that may throw experienced 18xx'ers off balance won't be an issue for beginners.  For example the fact that a single track can be used by multiple trains seems to reflect how real railroads use real track, even if other 18xx games don't work this way.

RATING: 8.5
One of my favorite 18xx titles. Due to the variable set-up, it appears to have fewer "opening moves" that are the same every game. The auction for Privates has been replaced with bidding for the option to open a company charter.

Get a station marker in London, even if you don't have a way to currently get there with your train.

Components: standard for a 18XX

Weight: heavy
Players: 4 or 5
Length: from 4 to 6 hours
Mechanics: stocks, route building
Decisions: could say a lot and being short in the description
Opinion: this is a 18XX game and I will enter in detail on that, just to say that fighting with 1861 to become my favorite 18XX.
This one has several new things that I love from others 18XX. There are no private companies, so no positioning at the start and equals the ability from experienced players versus new ones.
You have lot of replayablity with the 16 companis (out of 20) that will play each game. Moreover, each of them will have a train permit and could only run that type of train.
You have 3 train types, being different (and logical) all of them. While this could seem more difficult in comparison with other 18XX, I found the calculation of revenue easier than others (trains can share the same route, and receiving revenue for different things makes this easy).
The way you can fund companies, beside the typical fund with shares, here you have the option to fund one with the help of the Parliament (bid on the Company, and establish the initial value), making the company starts with all money in its treasury
What more to say, you have mergers between companies, companies that can be started again and, probably most important thing, no option to be ruined due to the play of another player (companies can gain money selling its own shares or refinancing), so you could not end with a broken company having to pay all your money and part of your shares.
In a nutshell, enough differences from other 18XX to make it an awesome game. Having all the spirit of 18XX

An advanced 18xx with two types of capitalisation and three types of train, spread amongst a possible 16 companies that compete on a relatively small map. This game nicely captures the quaint atmosphere of rural railways in Britain, but there's still room for nastiness in tokening out the dense array of cities and rusting other players' trains. For my money it's Mike Hutton who's most effectively pushing the 18xx envelope at the moment, this provides all the interest of the Ohley titles in a very manageable playing time.

RATING: N/A
First impression on one incomplete play: despite being my first 18XX game, I found the rules to be digestible and not altogether overwhelming. On the other hand, the gameplay itself (that is, knowing what to do and when to do it) is massive and will take many plays to fully comprehend. I'm very excited to dig into this one.

RATING: 2
There's nothing about an 18xx game that provides me any form of enjoyment, and so the prospect of spending another three hours(at minimum) per session at least half a dozen more times just to progress past the conscious incompetence stage is unappealing. The strategies and tactics of this genre will forever remain opaque to me.

2017-03: Downgraded simply due to rules overhead. I'd still love to play this with people who don't have to be (re)taught every time but that seems unlikely.

2014-07: Intricate and hugely variable and barrels headlong towards the endgame. My favorite 18xx so far. After three plays I feel like I understand *how* to merge companies to good effect, but not necessarily *when* to do so...

RATING: 8.5
There's a lot to like about this 18xx, from the variable setup to the density of decisions in the game. Running 3 types of trains crisscrossing the tiny map, together with the difficulty of analyzing the optimal timing of mergers/acquisitions, makes this a very challenging game.  It reminds me of 1846 because of the brevity, 1817 because of the many companies and share dilution with mergers, and 1860 because of the ability to own 100% or sell down to 0%, as well as the up to quad-jumps on the stock. Rather different from other 18xx but interesting in its own way

RATING: 7
After a half dozen plays, I've yet to figure out this 18xx game.  It focuses on mergers (which isn't that new) and "permits".  Each rail company has a permit (randomly distributed at the beginning of the game) which allows them to run one of three types of trains: local, express and freight.  Each generates revenue just a bit differently.  A company can only get permits for other train types by merging with another company.  So it adds another dimension to the [b][family=19][/family][/b] thing.  Truth be told, I enjoyed this one a bit more through reminiscing about it than during the actual play.

The trains are perhaps a tad more complicated than I'd prefer, but the end game is once again well done. I certainly want to play again, and I appreciate the three-hour play time.

18XX from the counties where I grew up. 

Played three player game. Lots of fun with and variety in this game. Mergers are essential to keep control in the train rush and it's important to merge companies that complement each other rather than duplicate. The variance in the setup will mean the opportunities must be considered a fresh in each game. Quite tame with just three with no big dumps and not so much blocking.

Masterpiece!

This is a great simulation of a stock market and all the dirty tricks we were used to in other games of the 18xx series are gone. No more ruining a company to drop it on another player. Consequently freedom for the players to buy shares of companies of which they are not directors. And a lot of other rules changes that go all in the direction of making a game in which one wins owning the best shares and not through dirty tricks. The tricks that experienced 18xx players were used to (as the above mentioned dropping of a company, or the buying and selling shares of a company in a single stock round to lower its value) are all gone. Some 18xx veterans may not like it, but IMHO the freedom, the huge decision space that 1862 offers opens the road to a second generation 18xx, much better than the (already wonderful) way of the past.

There are still a lot of ways to interact with the other players. Just an example: can you imagine a small map where up to 16 (16!) companies can operate, each with up to 7 station tokens? There is even a phase in which one has to win an auction to have the rights to start the (perceived) best company. And it is not an easy going game for a lot of other reasons: I can mention the brutal way the trains rush. Or the crazy way shares prices can literally jump forward.

There are so many other things to like. There is a random set up of the starting 16 companies. Merge and acquisitions. Two ways to start a company. Three types of trains. Not only the decision space is huge, but the replayability is greater than in any other game I have played in my life (not only of the 18xx series). 

And so much more, without making the rules complicated, on the contrary, one can see that anything in the game has been designed to enhance ease of play, even the (simpler than usual) track tiles. As important example I cite the simplification of the revenue calculation (each station or off-map area can be counted only once, tracks of different trains can overlap, at least one of the train must run in the home station: all this makes calculation easier). 

There are no private companies: this, added to initial random set up, removes the possibilities of having  "masters" of the game whose proficiency is based on stats on the best companies, private or otherwise. 

Last but not least this is one of the shortest game of the series, that is really a great feat considering the depth it offers. 

As an added bonus the game is still good with only two players.

Is this game for everyone? No, please try it only if you are not afraid of heavy games. As said the rules of this game are not very heavy, but playing and playing well is heavy. But if you are like me and if you like heavy games, then do not miss it!

Games of the 18xx series are my preferred. I wanted to differentiate their rating, but till now there is none of the ones I have played  that I would give less than a 10 rating (if I did I am afraid I could not give any 10 to any other game not in the series).

Considering the above, I had decided to put at the top of my top ten list the entire 18xx series instead of the single games of the series, to leave room to other ânormalâ games not in the series.  But after âmeetingâ 1862 everything changes... this is my preferred 18xx game, this is my preferred game! So I have put it at the top of my top ten, followed by the 18xx series and then by other games.

Have I already said that I like it?

RATING: 10
One of the best 18xx games out there. The varying start locations/company types are great for variety and replayability. I am a fan of this type of track, where only tokenable cities are junctions (so yes, I also like 1860). The decision between starting your company chartered/non-chartered is always delightfully hard and mergers work quite intuitively once you get the hang of them. All in all, one of my all-time favourite games.

A fairly large game on a small map. It supports 3 okay but I suspect 4 would be better.
Like 1860, it is pretty different to standard 18xx e.g. Players can own 100%, Presidency is 30% and can be dropped into the bank pool, there's no presidential liability for forced train purchases etc. 
There are 3 types of train that score cities differently. Companies can merge together which adds lots of interesting implications.

Bah, I stickered some of the tokens in the wrong color. Sticker sheet was unclear and I went with my best judgement. Half are correct, other half...well, at least my copy will be unique. Doesn't effect gameplay, but it's annoying.

Not happy with the new types of trains. For whatever reason, I was constantly confused using the freight trains. No forks in green track was strange.

1862 just edges out 1860 as the best 18xx game.

(The optional rule to only play with express trains, instead of all 3 types of trains, also makes this game suitable to introduce new players to 18xx.)

Quick variant with fairly high degree of complexity, which is a nice combination.

This - which all the 18xx fanboys at my local games club seem to think is the best game ever - is, in all fairness, perhaps the best of the 18xx games I've played. Merging companies is an interesting addition, especially in combination with the main new features here - the different types of trains which pay out for different things (Freight trains are stupidly strong at the end of the game but don't do so much early, whereas local trains are pretty much the opposite, with the Express trains being somewhat solid throughout the game). But it still retains the basic 18xx framework - which means I still don't want to play it.

It's a clean and perfect game. With that said, there are some reasons why I don't give it a higher score. Well, there's actually only one: it's not my favorite cup of tea. There are 18XX-ers around me who proclaim that this game is the very best game they have ever played in their lives; I do understand. It has a very euro feel to it that is merciless and unforgiving of mistakes. More games you play, exponentially better you get. 

Still, it gets better every game. I remember enjoying it half as much on my first game.

--Dec2013-- Very very cool.  The train rush is ferocious; the mergers entertaining; the dynamics charming.  I really enjoyed the first play, and am looking forward to more.

I really like the different company types with this one.  Every game is a bit different due to the random starting order and random company types.  The game does have a few flaws with the train manifest though.  The A trains rust too quickly, the B trains last too long, and the early permanent trains are too cheap which allows companies to buy 2 or 3 of them in the same turn.  Despite these issues, I still really like playing this game and I'm always willing to play it if anyone suggests it as an option.

Easily the best 18xx I've ever played. Tough decisions always and also always something interesting to do. One could say that some of the complexity is too much or unnecessary but the truth is that everything in the game works pretty well and all of its elements are perfectly combined.

Opening a company has lots of layers and players struggle to find the best way to deal with those. The mid game is incredibly tense and the winner cannot be predicted too soon as the market changes and progresses quiet aggressively until the end.

My only 'problem' is related to the difficulty in catching all the nuances when reading the board in order to determine the companies' runs.

Impressive 18xx game set in East Anglia. There are plenty of similarities with other games in the series, whereby you're purchasing shares in companies, constructing a rail network and running train on it. The main differences between other games using this system that I've played so far are the introduction of permits (express, local, freight), requiring their own type of train to run and earning revenue in different ways. The map is also relatively small for a game that can accommodate up to 16 different companies, although many of these will merge throughout the game. It does however result in a clamour for stations and blocking rival companies is a definite possibility. Despite this , some companies can make some pretty large share price gains towards the end of the game. Overall, this is a highly recommended experience for anyone with an interest in 18xx and railway/stock games

Never played it.  Bought as kickstarted but then sold as soon as received.  Looked to similar to 1860 for my likes.

As well as moved from gaming group that played 18XX a bunch so knew wouldn't get it to the table.

After 2 plays, this is my favorite 18xx. It took me awhile to wrap my head around the different train types/permits, but once I did, I saw so many layers. Add in the possibilities with Mergers and its one where there really is no clear path to victory.

My only complaint is that there is little stock manipulation. So what if I sell your stock and it goes down, it will probably be easier for it to multi-jump back up. Even with this, at this time I find the operations game mesmerizing.

Lots of meat packed in short playing time (for 18xx). Very good.

An interesting addition to the 18xx field. The different train types add a nice set of competing goals. The small map forces player interaction in pleasantly aggressive ways. The variable starting assignments adds substantial replay value.

GAME: The Extraordinary Adventures of Baron Munchausen
RANK: 2432
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Picked up a really attractive version of the book from Mongoose at Origins 2009.  I haven't played it yet, but the lavish binding makes me appreciate it even just as a book to read.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
How can you not love a game such a this?  A game of blustery storytelling?  A game of outlandish tales and outrageous lies?  A game of creativity and cunning as you out-think your foes by telling the craziest story you can imagine - which is, of course, completely 100% true.

Have I told you about the time I single-handedly saved the world from an invasion of French hamsters?  Well, you are in for a treat!  It all starts like this - once I was assigned as an Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire...

This is one of my favorite drinking games! A large group of friends used to sit in front of the fireplace, light this huge candlabra (sp?) and have a great time. We were playing this before the this set of rules was published.  If anyone could tell me if this is a traditional drinking game I would like that.  This is well worth the couple of bucks it sells for.  Spend the money you save on more beer.  Hours of fun.

The rules are very well written and totally entertaining.  It is worth getting a copy of this just for that alone.  I am not sure how the game will play but it seems like it could be a riot with the right group of people.  Either theater people or literature people, or both but the group would probably have the most fun if they were a little tipsy.

 Hilarious. This is a niche game FOR SURE. But I LOOOVE improvisation and this game with drinks and a group of friends who also love to improv just sings. Not for everyone, and can totally fall flat outside of the ideal group. I'm lucky enough to have an ideal group and enjoy this one immensely. Some great story telling has emerged from my plays.

It's really not a game.

This is not to say the experience will be a bad one, the game has a style that many should enjoy, particularly if you are used to such story-telling.

For myself, I prefer the more mundane story to the unbelievably ridiculous.  This does not stop one from having fun with it.

I have ordered the new edition, I cannot wait for this to arrive!

It has arrived, a hilarious book, well worth the buy on the amusement factor alone!  The game sounds as if it will be a blast!  I look forward to recounting some of my lesser known adventures in fine company soon.

Update: When played with the right crowd this is a hilarious game - but it is more of a fun activity than a 'game' per se.

Interesting idea, unfortunately it's not a game... no rules at all.. everyone tells a story and everyone votes who's story was best. Just play a Roleplaying game.

To clarify: If one would be so awesome, that the story he invents impromtu is interesting for everyone.. you wouldn't have to play this game at all.. just tell each other funny anecdotes & horse around.
So what happens is everyone fabricates a lame storie haphazardly, and everyone is bored.

Don your fancy-pants title, cinch up your noble britches, make sure you toast your fellow adventurers, and bring to bear your best worst haughty European accent as you are challenged in a game of tall tales, wagers, and fabulously extraordinary adventures. Each player is challenged to tell a tale beginning with a few suggestions by another player. “Oh, Grand Admiral Fancypants the Sixth, I do so enjoy the tale of the time you fought and conquered the den of 100 albino thieves with but a single tack as your weapon... Please tell it again.” Afterwards, players are allowed to wager coins (or other tokens) to add incredulous hiccups into that player’s story. “Grand Admiral, is it true that the master thief had a pack of orangutans trained in the deadly eastern arts of assassination? How ever did you deal with that?” And so, the improv storytelling ensues with the player with the most entertaining tale of all walking away the talk of the table!

RATING: 10
Tell a story. Then when everyone has, everyone votes whose story was best. But wait, there's more! The # of votes you get depends on how many challenges you've taken while telling your story and on how many challenges you've given to others when they tell theirs. It's an extremely clever storytelling game.

Firstly, this belongs on the RPG side, not the Boardgame side.

RATING: 10
one of the best games ever!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
1. Best rule book ever. The rules themselves are an example of how to play the game! Actually, the complete rules of the game are compressed onto the last page. The rest of the book is a voluminous and effervescent rambling, replete with digressions and hyperbole; a paragon of the style players should employ while playing this game!

2. Surprisingly educational! The game itself teaches -- and encourages -- players to tell good stories. You [b]want[/b] players to interrupt your story, and you [b]want[/b] to integrate the bizarre and illogical ideas into your own stories. These interruptions force you, the story-teller, to think about your own story in a totally different way, and greatly help you add drama and unexpected twists to lead you to the logical end to your story.

However, how do you make other players *want* to interrupt your story with wonderous digressions? You need hooks in your story, details that drag your listeners to your narrative. So you realize the basic elements of the story -- characters, setting, descriptions -- are essential to captivate your listeners, and consequently your story-telling skills dramatically improve!

3. The strange part of the game is that we don't want to do the last part: vote on who told the best story. The purpose of interrupting a story (I think) is to help improve the story, not screw up the story-teller. Consequently, the game itself feels like a collaboration, not a competition. And after that, who wants to declare a winner (and as consequence, a bunch of losers)?

When next you are travelling overland to Cairo by carriage, if your fellow travellers are the genteel sort unlikely to be impressed by a rousing game of eye-spy, then dust off this fine game.

On one ocassion, travelling towards Marseilles, I failed to accord precedence to the Archbishop of Metz, and barely lived to tell the tale.

I am very pleased to report of the wonderfully described accounts of the most notable Baron this world, quite a few others worlds, and even few different planes of existence have ever had the great honor of receiving.  The Baron gives us experienced factual descriptions and most eloquently stated rulings to the greatest  of past times, wagers.

The noble choice is your to select whose recounting of marvelous adventures that endear your very heart and soul.

All that is needed to complete the requirements for this particular wager is a few people that have an adventure to share, tokens that complement the location, and the libations that you find most suitable for your palette. 

My your adventures be grand.

This is a roleplaying game, not a boardgame.  I love roleplaying, and Baron M is good fun - the sort of thing to do when no-one has made up a scenario for an ongoing campaign.  However it only works with people prepared to roleplay.  The central scoring mechanic is flawed so playing it to find a winner is pointless.  For boardgamers wanting a taste of roleplaying there are better products.  Pantheon, also published by Hogshead Press is another form of GMless roleplaying; but it is less difficult to get into as players build the story one sentence at a time within some genre guidelines, it allows challenges but has a slightly better mechanic than Baron M, and it has a scoring system that kind of works.  Can be played as creatively or plodsidaisically as desired.

Do you like telling lies? ;)

I do, even if there are just a few rules. But it's hard to find the proper people to play this one. It will end with a failure more often than not. People find it stressful. And I find it boring most of the time because making a "good" story on the fly is not for everyone. DEFINATELY not for everyone. The game doesn't help you that much with that. The only rule is that other player could give you some hint on how to go on. Meh.

Basically a loose set of rules for a tall-tale-telling game.  I haven't played it, but it was interesting reading and would probably be fun with the right crowd.

Great roleplaying game. Reading the book alone is hilarious. Gotta set the right mood and have the right people, but in that scenario it is a killer. Maybe a good pairing would be Werewolf.

I swear that this game is indeed based on a true history told to me by my grand-grandfather.

The rules are certainly fun - although yet to find the right group to try this with

Storytelling game - you don't really need a rulebook or anything else to play, once you know how it works.

Similar concerns that I have with Aye Dark Overlord.  It takes a specific group of people who enjoy improv and roleplaying to enjoy this game, something that is a lot more difficult to get together than it is to just plan to play a board game.  Also, im a bit disappointed in my friends lack of knowledge of the source material.

I like this game, but, even so, its fun factor is highly dependent on the people you play it with.

Great storytelling game, great rules. Non-drinkers and non-gentlemen please keep out

Probably my Favorite RPG:
extreme minimalism in the "crunchy bitz" (Rules)
and extreme sophistication and humour in the Fluffy Bitz (setting & Character).

Perfect.

I've adapted the milieu to allow for those poor Souls
unfamiliar w/ Munchausen:
Time Lords.
Again:

Perfect.

I have too many similar games, and would rather play a pick-up roleplaying game than this.

An interesting read and a interesting sounding experience. It's more a diversion than a game.

Aye! Dark Overlord is very close to the same game with little more direction for the players.

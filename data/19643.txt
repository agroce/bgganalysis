To be honest, I'd say there's very little *zing* in the game (pretty cards for the most part with some humor on a few). But it plays out rather ho-humly with building resources (slowly with only one played per turn) and attacking with allies and flinging abilities about. Some games can be rather lopsided depending on when cards come out of your deck (another typical CCG problem). The game also has the often seen CCG problem of having too many special terms on their cards. You'll need to strongly refer to the rulebook for at least the first half dozen plays (terms like Ferocity, Protector, Ongoing, Elusive, Berserking, etc.). Maybe a sequence of play card with some defined terms on the reverse (in each stater box) would be a useful addition. Then there's cards that have that what-the-frack text which makes both players freeze up and grinds the game to a halt.

And so on and so forth. I  firmly believe that a player's level of enjoyment with this game will rise exponentially with how much of a *jones* they get from the WOW world. Others need not apply (or go pick up some cheap Magic cards on ebay from some poor sap going through a divorce or who's oldest child is headed off to college).

Uh oh, since my Magic: The Gathering fiasco, I decided that I would never buy into a collectible card game again. And then, I became obsessed with World Of Warcraft online. I always appreciated the artwork in Magic, and I still appreciate WoW, so I got easily sucked into the collectible card game. I haven't played the trading card game yet, and I don't even know if I'll ever get around to it. 

Bonus: I won some green cauldron for in-game use that gives a novelty buff of green spew from the mouth of your toon.

Bought 1 starter and 6 boosters.  The starter contained fixed deck(druid) and 2 boosters.  Got another starter and 16 more boosters.  The 2nd starter is the mage starter.

The only thing I don't like is the starter packaging.  There is no way to tell what class you get since the fixed deck is inside the hard case.
Unless you buy from Ebay, you may not get the class you like.

You do not need to play World Of Warcraft to enjoy this game. You have a hero card that you can assign other item cards to (weapons, armor, items etc) and minion cards that act as party members. You have classes and quests and all sorts of fluffy sounding stuff. The game its self is fun and easy to learn. The rules are well laid out and you can really get a feel for the game is it goes along. The boosters are randomised (Magic The Gathering style). A good game, not as good as Magic, but in the same breath, it is a different sort of game compared to Magic.

Awesome game. Problem, there is NO ONE in my area that plays it. Sure, they play the MMO, but they're not THAT obsessed with WoW. So I've never really played it. But I know enough to tell you it looks really good and the artwork is great.

love the theme, love the classes/factions, love the cards-as-resources mechanic, and the gameplay is fairly simple but solid.  i'm surprised at how well-balanced the original release seems.  i've avoided mmorpgs entirely and probably always will, but just playing the war3 rts game gives one plenty of familiar faces.  i like the idea of an officially sanctioned common/uncommon format, etc.  the legendary/epic rares make opening packs more fun too.  the game doesn't seem to have picked up enough traction to make it though, and my interest has waned.  i'd rather play harry potter.  i should stop screwing around with in-print collectible games.  not because i'm anti-collectible, it's just that i fall behind due to a lack of attending a player community.

This has replaced Magic as my new CCG obsession.  There are still some kinks to work out, but this has an elegance to it that actually elevates it above Magic.  However, that's for the constructed set only -- draft formats and number of players keep this from getting as high a rating as Magic.

The only rival for Magic as the best CCG... and it's absolutely cheaper! It sadly went down with UDE, and the efforts from Cryptozoic to resuscitate the game can be vain...

RATING: 8
I find it better than MTG. While MTG in its basic form is more sophisticated, it suffers from the mathematical format and its ... 13000 card set.
Really MTG is unplayable and unbalanced in its extended formats of play.

Warcraft card game is much more a fighting match with much more flair. The link to Wow is of course tremendous for the "loot" cards.

Helas the game is discontinued as of July 2013. Blizzard pulled the plug after they beta launched the on line Heartstone.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Played a fair amount of this, and by fair I mean 10 games or so, and while it is no MtG killer, it is interesting enough, with enough options and pretty chrome (as well as the online game tie ins) to keep me entertained.  The horrible downside is that there are something like 8 classes, which means each booster you buy, the cards will be split between Alliance Only, Horde Only, Items (which not all classes can use), class cards, and quests.  This means that to get a lot of card to use for your particular classed deck, you will need to BUY A LOT OF CARDS TO BE COMPETITIVE.

I’m not a fan of collectable (card) games and World of Warcraft is no exception: I don’t like the «collectable» part, as it means addiction, heavy expenses and a monothematic interest in a single game.

I have to acknowledge World of Warcraft is an enjoyable game though: its core rules are quite simple to grasp and it’s flexible enough to accomodate different ways to play, from the typical one-on-one games all the way up to the videogame-inspired semicooperative raids.

As usual with such games though, to excel at World of Warcraft one has to invest a lot of money, time and research, none of which I am willing to spend on this game. [i](December 2012)[/i]

[b]Update[/b] - I’m told World of Warcraft has been dead for some time now. Rating rounded down from 6,5 to 6 during my Fall 2015 rating revise.

RATING: 9
Art is great, nice mix of heroes, interesting deck building options plus future group play using Raid decks where several players play against the deck and the first one to beat it wins. Completely sold out as of 10-27-06 in my area. Too expensive for what you get. If you want to focus on one character or class you still have to buy a booster box at least just to get a decent character. Boardgamers don't like it for the collectible aspect and besides there's already a WoW boardgame with a nice expansion due any day. CCG players don't like it because it's not as deep as Magic. and WoW online players are getting the real thing for only $15 a month max, so what's their real incentive to buy the packs? a long shot at a rideable turtle? Still it looks great, really great, and with the raid deck multiplayer it will create a new category of multiplayer TCG, so let's wait and see if it doesn't get better.

Seems really simple, I worry if they've dumbed it down a bit too much.  My favorite thing about Magic is finding hidden, interesting combos that actually work, this seems to stay away from that realm completely so far.  We'll see what future expansions bring.

I'm a sucker for all things Warcraft, but this is actually a pretty fun system. It completely eliminates the most frustrating thing about Magic -- being mana screwed. Excellent design decision.

very similiar to MTG but better in some ways. Doesnt seem to have the richness of them as MTG does but that could be the fact that I bought 3000 cards from the first few expansions and don't really have any decks that were streamlined all were thrown together with the cards I had to hand.
I prefer to MTG and cant wait to try a raid deck.

RATING: 7.5
A TCG with a huge fan following and a well-marketed franchise. The cards are ergonomically well-designed and are very attractive. Gameplay and mechanics are not as deep as Magic:The Gathering, but fun nevertheless. As of Dec 2006, there seems to be limited types of action and cardplay per hero, enticing the player to try many heroes, and thus spend more money. Unless the gameplay and mechanics get more complex, I think this may be a flash in the pan to be enjoyed while the buzz lasts.

I loved the looking at new cards and deckbuilding for playing this but the game itself seems to lack something. It kind of goes on a bit - maybe because I was playing a Paladin but my opponents said the same after playing each other and they were different characters. We shall see after more plays maybe. 7 Plays.

RATING: 5
Not a bad CCG to get me back into this genre after being out of CCG's for nearly 8 years.  I think the game played much easier for me because of my working knowledge of the MMORPG that I have a character for.

EDIT:  08/04/16 - After reading this, it is amazing how naive and stupid I was back in 2008 when I first wrote a comment about it.  This game was fine when I used to play it, but it is amazing how my tastes in games change.  Dropped the rating from a 7.5 to a 5 - I really don't want to play this game ever again.

Very streamlined game, but haven't played in years. Started playing the card game before I played the computer game (which I still play), otherwise I may have gotten more into the card game.

Just like with Magic, I just can't get into the trading card games.  I give this one a higher rating only because of the warcraft theme, which for me makes it a bit more interesting.  I may try one of the Living Card Games from Fantasy Flight.  I hear lots of good things about those as opposed to the trading card games.

Captures the feel of the online game enough to keep me engaged.  Raid deck system is a great idea, but getting enough other players has been tough to do, we tried Molten Core with 3 twice so far: its fun, but may not be doable with a normal deck. Deck-building is interesting and fun, especially if you play online too.

I just came back from my friend's house after having a threesome with WoW TCG (all three decks were mine as I'm a collector of card games )and while we were all a bit disappointed in the game, we also _did_ enjoy it enough to wanna try it again and my friend Oscar even said that he would probably pick up a starter pack next pay-day :)

Besides, we're convinced that any upcoming game sessions will most likely be a lot more fun since we can then add the content of booster packs to our decks.

Aug. 21, 2008 -- Essentially a M:tG knock-off, but with added fun and strategy. Deck building is more enjoyable, and I really like the different styles of decks that can be built. Combat is also more to my liking than the M:tG style. I've played ten times now, and I've been mostly getting my butt kicked, but I could see myself playing this regularly for the next while. 7/10

I wanted to like it... I was on the forums before the game released, signed up to run tournaments, even. It just isn't good. The game itself has fewer decisions than even Magic. The only interesting part of deck-building is deciding how many/which quests to run, which restores some of the risk-calculation that the game mostly forfeits with the elimination of color-based resources.

One of my favorite CCGs.  This has almost replaced Magic for me.  I like how any card can be used as a resource, and all resources are equal (no need to distinguish between a red resource or a black resource).  The different classes seem to be balanced overall in a rock-paper-scissors sort of way.  The game is excellently supported.  The raid decks are a novel concept.  Too bad no one else in my area plays (I can't find Magic players either though).

Magic is much better.  What is the deal with only giving 30 cards in the starter deck.  At least Magic preconstructed decks have some cool mechanics and combinations out of the box.  I will definitely play again, but I am somewhat disappointed/unimpressed.

However, the box the cards come in is top-notch.

This game has owned me, since the day it shipped. Great deck-building that allows you to identify with your hero, killer card combos, the classes play very different from one another, it's more accessible than Magic, and there is no Mana Screw. It will own you.

Most CCGs are 90% DeckBuilding and 10% playing.  That's fine with me; I like the exercise of making a good deck.  The best ones shift that percentage towards the play experience %.  L5R is really quite tactical in the attack phase, for instance.  NetRunner requires a ton of risk-analysis for a run, even if the cardplay after is deterministic.  This CCG, however, has absolutely nothing on the play side.  There are no decisions to be made from the point you decide to mulligan or not on.  On top of that, the deck building is incredibly restrictive as your choice of hero determines what cards you can even put in your deck.  So 50% in deckbuilding, and yet 0% in the play.  Skip this unless you absolutely must have the cute little vanity pet.

Don't get much of a chance to play this. The big draw  back for me was the restrictions for making your deck. That in combination with being a TCG just made it really hard for weekend warrior to have something that could compete. Working on making a dozen or so hero decks to play against the raid decks I own and then will probably sell off the rest of my collection.

RATING: 6
This is a decent CCG.  Based on the card game alone, I would probably rate it higher.  The biggest reason for marking it down is the marketing for this game.  I'm not overly fussy on how WoW TCG has the epic and loot cards in addition to the normal common, uncommon and rares, making collecting the sets harder.  The raid decks are an awesome idea for multi-player but yet again is also money grab for people trying to collect sets because they're somewhat expensive and you get so few cards per raid deck that can be used in standard play.  One thing I dislike about the game is that if you pick one class/faction to play, then 90% of what you get in a booster pack will be worthless to you since there are 9 classes and you can't use abilities from other classes, that's not even to mention what your faction restricts you to.  This is somewhat alleviated by buying a starter deck but you can't even pick your class in your starter deck because it's random and unknown until you've opened the starter.  Again, it's a fun game but too much BS to consider competitive play or collecting.  If you consider the money cost of CCG's such as this one and others to be too much of a burden, you should consider trying The Game of Thrones or Call of Cthulhu LCG.  It's not a perfect business model for consumer but it's a lot better than Magic or WoW.

This game is like Magic 2.0, its smoothed out and streamlined. its really fun to play even though i have never touched the online WoW game.

*Update*
After 144 plays and hundreds and hundreds of pounds spent on it I have sold all my sets and no longer play at all (with the exception of with my friend every now and then to keep him happy). Its still a good game, but the cost and my moving away from the TCG model made me sell up.
Also, I find TCGs too aggressive and annoying a lot of times.

RATING: 6
I only ever player this as a co-operative game against the raid decks.

I really liked this very novel way to approach a CCG as usually it is PvP, usually 2 player only but these raid decks allowed multiple players to play against the large more powerful raid deck. 

Unfortunatly as more and more cards were released the power level of the cards crept up until one of our players who bought more than the rest of us was able to dominate every single game with much more powerful cards than the rest of us had. Interest in the game pretty much died overnight.

Discarded in house moving purge (2015).

It's fast. It has great arts. It borrows lots of mechanics from "King" Magic The Gathering but without the mana screw. It's simple enough and it will probably beef up with the next few expansions (there's lots of unused things here that i't easily guessable they wanted to go with simplicity for the first set of cards).
I think this is a winner.
Plus it's fun, lots of fun :)

RATING: 6.5
My friend loves this game so taught it to me, and wants me to purchase a starter deck.  However, this is a collectible card game--a never ending money pit.  Not very excited about perhaps getting hooked by this game.

He assures me that unlike Magic and some of the other collectible card games, you can buy a starter deck and win games against established decks--not tournament decks, however.

I loved online WOW and was insanely hooked & truly addicted--9 months of my life disappeared, so had to cut it off cold.  The card game has many of the elements and does a good job of imitating the online game--but WOW it isn't.

The cards are pretty and enjoyable to view.  The symbols on the cards are easily understood.  The text is not overwhelming or especially difficult, especially if you are already familiar with WOW.  The rules are few and easily understood, and included is a helpful glossary.  I like that the starter decks are different for the hoard/alliance and for each of the classes.  

I am not excited about it but will be purchasing a starter deck--most likely a Hunter since that was my favorite on WOW. 

Can play a game in 20-30 mins.

Fun with my son. As a side note, I bought some booster packs from a dealer at a card show shortly after the game had been released.

I considered it a good opportunity to discuss greed and its effects with my boy.

M:tG knockoff set in the World of Warcraft MMO world of Azeroth.  If you play the MMO as I did, you will find it fun to play and do battle with the familiar Alliance and Horde characters.  I got the collecting bug bad when this first came out in 2006 and have   most of the first set.  Went to GenCon SoCal in Fall '06 and played tournaments all frickin' day long, got completely sick of the game, and haven't picked it up since.  Maybe one of these days I'll play again, but now there are expansions out that I don't have so I'm sure to get pwned.

RATING: 8
After playing about dozen rounds of this, my opinion of the game has improved from the original 7. It does many things right by being dynamic, fast-paced and fun to play, something that can't be said about all the CCGs out there. Also even the basic set offers the opportunity to build more variety of deck types than it would seem at the first glance. It still has a way to go to be as flexible and varied as M:tG, but that should improve in the future sets when some of the so-far unused elements of the game are introduced. Negatives are summed up by some things that do not feel very thematic and the emphasis of deckbuilding over playing skills, although that is not as big a deal as some of the critics make it sound like.

Another okay "Magic: The Gathering" rip-off. It suffers from two main problems:
1) you won't find many players for this one around, while you'll have no problem to track down other MtG-Players, and 2) MtG offers a broader variety of cards and mechanisms while basically scratching the same itch in terms of gameplay and theme.
May be worth a look if you really love World of Warcraft though.

"Willing to play" doesn't really apply anymore - while the game itself was challenging and interesting, the community in regionals and above had too many enflated egos for me.

Wow, it's like a much improved version of Magic... That alone makes it interesting, and the theme is great as far as I'm concerned.

Received a lot of cards in a September 2012 Math Trade (gave up LotR Hunt for Gollum & Conflict at the Carrock).

Received a total of ~3700 cards!  A nice mix of heroes, class abilities, allies, equipment, quests, & locations.

Have made a few decks and played a few times with Russ.  Enjoying the system, but overwhelmed by the amount of content I received.  Need to sort through it and trade away some decks to reduce the amount of cards I have. 

Sold the collection in pieces.  Three sales of 300 card lots sorted into playable decks, then a final sale of the remaining cards.  Glad to have tried it and moved it on so other people could try it.

I currently have 435 cards, not a complete set of the 361 in the 1st edition as obviously I have some duplicates.This is exactly what you would expect in a TCG.  Either you love them or you hate them.  I am one of the weird ones who never got into Magic, but for this game I liked the WoWC board game (never played the PC game)so I thought would try the card game.  I like the quickness of this game there is nothing long and drawn out about it.  Object is to just kill your opponents Hero with any means necessary, or at least the cards you have in your play deck.Like the fact that you can play as different Heroes as well because all have the own special cards that only work for them.

UPDATED 04/05/07, currently have 835 cards.

Ok fun to play, seems a little less cluncky than magic and with more bluffing since the whole 'action' phase is more loose and elegant. I got 2 starter decks and some allies, warrior and mage and they seem horribly unbalanced, so I guess it suffers from the TCG curse, just like MTG. As a veteran WOW player, this was more fun though, since it references a lot of the MMORPG elements. Might be better as a all-against-one experience (got a couple of raid decks for 1 euro each at Essen)

Fairly light card game, mainly dealing with summoning creatures and attacking the opponent. It doesn't have the variability of MtG where a player could build almost any type of deck (from pyro to land-d to deck-mills); this game is creature-heavy, and focuses mainly on that. There are some interesting ideas here, and the game is VERY easy to pick-up, so newbies should have no problem playing it.

Minor gripe about tracking the Life of each creature, especially the Hero. MtG was a little more elegant in that sense.

My first and only foray into the world of trading card games.  I rapidly discovered what a MASSIVE money sink they are and tried to cut myself lose.  But not before I'd sunk probably close to $100 into my collection.....

The game itself is immensely fun, and I enjoyed it a lot.  But I think I've clearly learned with my addiction to expansions in board games, that I need to steer faaaaar clear of any trading card games.  The only real reason it is a 9, is the fact that it IS a trading card game, which is a huge flaw in itself to me :).

*Edit* Just dropped this to an 8.  I've realized that the biggest problem with CCG games and their ilk is finding players, otherwise you have to provide cards for both sides, even then it is tough finding a game.  Also I'm not sure it's a game I'd qualify as "loving" anymore (see my profile for my rating system), since I'm not always wanting to play.

Pretty good for the first few expansions. Sadly, there are problem that were never really fixed, for example, going first gives you too much of an advantage because that's the player which will be calling the shots for most of the game. Give that power to a competent player and it's going to be really hard to win against. This problem was attenuated a little by introducing cards that had massive effect for 1 cost in many classes that did turn the tide in the first few turns.

The second problem is that equipment are getting out of hand since the destruction costs of these cards are typically higher than putting new ones into play. No idea if this problem was fixed, it's been a while I played.

Aside of these problems, it's a solid game.

It very quickly gets to the point of take a card, play that card, see what happens. Theres no real hand management. In a card battle game I don't think that flies. On top of this there's an endless amount of overpowered-seeming healing cards and the game just seems to drag on as a prolonged stalemate.

The World of Warcraft TCG draws from the rich lore of the Warcraft universe. Two factions are battling for supremacy over Azeroth the Horde and the Alliance and each time you play, you choose a hero from one of these factions to represent you. Your hero is the leader of your party who fights alongside your allies. The cards that you play will allow you to equip your hero with weapons and armor, use spells and talents, invite allies into your party, and complete quests.

RATING: 6
Bought 2 class starter decks.

The rules are quite clear.  The fact that they strongly resemble those of Magic was helpful (7 card at the beginning, the first player does not draw, 7 card hand limit, 1 Quest/turn = 1 Land/turn, Instants, etc.).

The card powers look very much like each other (draw cards, etc.), which is not much fun; I also feel "cheated", with cards with different artwork and names, but similar effects.  Maybe I got this feeling because I got starter decks instead of more advanced decks.  

I did not like how Allies die quickly: I have the feeling of working hard for not much.

The quests I got are quite boring: spend resources to get 1 or 2 cards.

Both the card names and the the flavor texts are not very enjoyable: lots of proper names that mean nothing to me.  Magic does it better, with descriptive names/neologisms, instead of the names of persons.

I remember the metagame at times being very overly centralizing, but I like how each hero class plays fairly differently, and unlike Magic you can attack other creatures rather than just the opposing hero, and since you can play any card into your resource row you can't get "landlocked".

Comments entered on 17 Mar 2010:

World of Warcraft Trading Card Game borrows many of the game play mechanics heavily from Magic: The Gathering. There is one huge game play difference though: The mana system in WoW:TCG is much more forgiving as being shorted on mana is impossible because every card can serve as a resource if desired. The other huge difference is the one that occurs before the game is even played. In World of Warcraft, you have to choose which hero you want to represent you. Each of these heroes has a one-shot special ability and differing amounts of life to start the game. These heroes also limit your options for deck building, as the class and alignment affects which pool of cards you can choose from for building a deck.

I have played quite a few games recently and this is a great alternative to playing Magic: The Gathering.

As all CCG's spend a bunch of money, get a lot of cards, build some decks and have fun.  The one unique thing about this game however is that it plays very similar to the MMORPG.  You have a tank/healer/dps, etc.  That is one of the cooler things about this CCG.

Brilliant game, if you like TCG's or CCG's or anything along those lines then I suggest you try this game out.

No "Mana Screwage" all cards can be played as resources and there is no specific type of resource required to play any cards. "In your face Magic the Gathering!".

I still love MTG don't get me wrong, but this game fixes a lot of MTG problems.

------- MTG feels like a duel between two mages whom are leading an army over an extended duration.
WOW TCG feels like a quick skirmish between two adventuring parties.

Collectible games have to fight an uphill battle to really win me over, and WoW won't make it in spite of very nice art. And the resource system is a tad better than Magic's, but this is the least that can be expected of a game that sits on the shoulder of a decade-old giant.

Raid decks are both a great concept and, unlike the base game, a chockful of truly original ideas, but they seem to be very hard to balance for casual players. And I'd never be more than that, even if the game were great.

This is the first TCG I've ever tried, and I must say, I'm pleasantly surprised at how much fun this can be.  The collectible aspect itself can be problematic if there are some cards you find out about that you want but are hard to get.  It is good if you can play in a group of people who are interested in different classes or factions so you can trade.  Hence the "Trading" part of TCG.
BTW, I never played the video game.

I rate CCGs and their expandable cousins (LCGs, etc.) on this basis: "I will never invest in one again, but assuming that someone else hands me a deck here's what I think of the game."

I like WoW, I like CCGs (though I rarely play them anymore), and I like quality components. None of those three things could paper over the fact that this is a dull game, and -- with the caveat that I never tried the raid experience -- doesn't do anything M:TG or the BSG CCG didn't do better.

I bought a starter just to see what it was like, saw what it was like in one awful game, and gave away my cards.

A friend of mine and I tried our first game tonight and I was thoroughly disappointed.  Overall, the mechanics were ok, but the crux of the game seemed to be to simply get out as many allies as you could and constantly attack the hero until he died.  I did not see much point in targeting the other player's allies unless it had a really annoying ability.

Update:  Played a few more games.  Determined that this is one of the most one dimensional CCGs ever.

Never thought I'd ever buy or play a CCG but I received a free starter deck along with some friends and we have been hooked recently. It is a surprisingly deep game. The strategy is in the deck building. The tactics occur once the game starts. I can see how the cost could get out of hand so my group of friends only purchases decks at the same time... and only if we all agree.

Demo'd at the MOZU booth at RinCon 2012.

It's just another CCG, and, especially relative to the intense metagame of V:TES or the clever and fierce cat & mouse game of Netrunner, it's one of those CCG's that plays you - the deck is built, you play the cards as they come up, but there aren't any meaningful choices, nor clever combos.

This game being collectible means the gameplay is fundamentally broken.  The process of figuring out what combinations are better is a puzzle not a game.  Sitting by yourself constructing a deck is the definition of solitary play (a puzzle).

Beyond that the business model of collectible games is deplorable.  It is a form of gambling targeted towards children.  It adds no benefit to the gameplay is done specifically to milk as much money from people as possible.

Wie so fast jedes Sammelkartenspiel, habe ich auch World of Warcraft mal ausprobiert. Das Konzept des Helden bringt etwas frischen Wind und Eigenständigkeit mit, war aber auch mein größter Kritikpunkt. Dafür das ich alles um den eigenen Helden dreht, war er in meinen Augen zu unbedeutend. Eine Fähigkeit, die nur einmal im ganzen Spiel ausgelöst werden kann? Trägt er keine Waffe, kann er noch nicht mal selber angreifen? Gefiel mir persönlich nicht so gut. Positiv war die Atmosphäre und wie Charaktere, Orte, Klassen und Fähigkeiten in das Spiel transportiert wurden.

In combination with the Raid-decks, this is easily an 8. Allows you to play with a whole group instead of one-on-one.

I have played several TCG/CCG in my time (starting with the granddaddy of them all, Magic: The Gathering).

This CCG is the closest I have come to capturing the feeling of playing Magic again, however with a few twists.

Suffers from the same problem as all other CCG's, it is a money sink and it is hard to keep up with releases and find the funds to buy all cards.

Gamewise, though, I recommend this. It is a lot of fun.

Fun and fast to play. Avoids the dreaded mana screw. Class-specific deck-constructions more difficult (=expensive) than in Magic because of the incompatibility of the cards and the higher number of classes (9) than colors (5).
Additionally the card-design is not that innovative and ballanced which leads to the problem that cards from newer editions are simply better and not different from older cards -> your precious cards are outdated fast.

Only watched my husband and a friend play, but it seems like a nice enough game that has some similarities to magic.

I got to play this with my husband, and it didn't work for me... I don't like that because you get to use all cards as resources, you end up having only one card to choose from, and you either play it, or you don't, it's either useful or it isn't. So the problem isn't not being able to pay for things, but it is not having anything to pay for...

Hopefully the expansions will show the same kind of care that the first release has.  Biggest concern is the "random" starters.  Duplicate starters really hurt.  

Update:  Well, sad truth is: once you quit playing the MMO, it's kinda hard to justify playing this.  I've got maybe six or seven starters and a raid deck...maybe a few dozen boosters...they're in the dead game file.

RATING: 10
Here's another 10 for me. WoW is simply the best Magic-child in existence.
I decided to buy this one when I saw the Raid Decks. I really like cooperative/team games and I found the idea really good and the multi-player possibilities very intriguing, so I bought some boxes and some singles and I created my first 20 thematic, quite strong decks (10 Alliance, 10 Horde) to play with the Raid Decks.

Then, play after play, I liked the game more and more and in the end I bought lot of cards and created over 140 highly-themed, strong decks.
About the game I can say that mechanics are VERY similar to those of Magic (too much in my opinion.. it's a real clone), but with some very good twists that improve the gameplay (I really like the idea behind the Resources system most of all) and, mostly, the fun factor, giving to the game in the end a better, more epic-fantasy feeling. I have to admit also that the background is more fascinating and charismatic than the (actual) Magic's one; furthermore the presence of heroes in play - each one with its own class and race - adds great feeling and theme to the game, sort of D&D-ish one. The artwork is very, very good, with incredibly brilliant colors (mostly for the most recent sets).

A note about the Raid Deck 'Assault on Icecrown Citadel': this Raid Deck is boxed with all the decks needed to play it - the boss deck (the Lich King) and three (very famous) heroes. Despite the new formula, I found the Raid very well done and balanced. Clearly it's a step behind for those who played the old Raids - and for players who like to build their custom decks, like I am - but it's for sure a great buy for those who don't have any WoW card, because it's a complete game out of the box. Absolutely recommended.

A note about the new Dungeon Decks/Battle of the Aspects Raid Deck: these new decks provide a whole new experience of play. Up to three players may compete against an automated mechanic which doesn't need a boss-player; simple rules allow the Dungeon to auto-play against the raiding heroes, also leveling-up by its own granting a progressive, exponential difficulty. I quite liked the idea, also if I always prefer the old Raids. Rules are a bit too much on the simple side for my tastes (I prefer some more 'solid' mechanics) and mechanics are too esponential: the boss may wreck havoc without possibilities for the heroes or, on the other side, be completely controlled/devastated by heores. It is rare to see a balanced game. I consider these products only good for very casual players.

A note about The Caverns of Time Raid Deck: this one is also an automated-Raid like its predecessors but very well done, with largely improved mechanics. During the Raid the heroes need to beat a variety of bosses (up to 10 total) which will become stronger and stronger as the game progresses; each boss has an 'enter in play effect' stronger the more bosses have been beated, so it balances also the mid/late game. I like this Raid very much.


EDIT: the game is now 'dead'. I like it so much that in the end I completed all sets, all existing promos, ALL. I love this game. On my table it will be always alive.

I am a fan of World of Warcraft online and eagerly looked forward to the card game after many years of being out of the CCG market.  The cards themselves are top notch.  I for one, REALLY, enjoy the deckbuilding which is built around a particular class from the game.  At this point, it does seem that certain classes have an advantage over others.  Time will tell if I am wrong about this as new builds become known.  If you enjoy CCG's this is a keeper!

An excellent trading card game. Much better than Magic: the Gathering.  It's quite similar to Magic (almost unavoidably since it's a TCG), but it adds things such as permanent damage, heroes, no stupid abilities- no vigilance, etc, allows plaeyrs to play any card from their hand as a resource ("land") and adds many more decisions.  Trust me.

I used to play this game when they were still making sets. I started buying since the first set but it wasn't till Aftermath that I started playing.

Mirrors the online game very well. Some builds seem far more powerful than others, but perhaps that's something that can be fixed with the right cards. Also, despite the outward appearance that this game is a pure marketing cash-in (hearing about the loot cards, UDE points, and four rarity levels made me nervous,) it's actually very playable  for not a huge investment. You will need to trade a fair amount, though.

This is a game that my 12 year old son loved. To me, it brings back memories of Magic:TG both good and bad. 

While not an entirely original game, WoW:TCG is a fairly polished one and fixes one of the main issues I had with some of the earlier CCG's- especially Magic:TG. In fact, this game almost feels like someone sat down with Magic, looked at the major pain points, attempted to fix them, and then released Magic 2.0 with new branding and a big IP to support it. 

Specifically, one of the biggest problems I had with the older CCG's is the way they manage resources. Getting mana-screwed is something most CCG players are familiar with... when the resources you need are all shuffled to the bottom of your deck never to be seen. The old Decipher CCG (Star Wars) had a very clever alternative system, but most followed blindly in the path that Magic forged. WOW does away with it entirely by allowing you to use ANY card in your deck as a resource. Just play it face down, and viola! 

WOW isn't perfect, though. Games of it can go on a little too long, and as with many CCG's, building decks can be more rewarding than actually playing.

Being collectable should be addressed. First, the packaging the starters come in is brilliant. Love them, and have actually retrofitted them to hold several of my other old CCG decks. For this game specifically, buying into the game takes a slightly bigger investment than other games. Returning to the Magic comparison.. in magic you had 5 colors/classes of cards. You could (theoretically) put any card into a deck, but generally you probably didn't want to put more than two colors in a deck. Still, most boosters would provide you cards you could use in whichever color deck you wanted. Building a deck in WOW requires buying a lot more cards because you can't mix and match the class cards. A Shaman card can only go into a Shaman deck (you can't have a shaman/priest deck, for instance). On top of the more restrictive nature, now there are 9 different classes instead of the more open 5 that Magic had. You may need cards for a Priest deck, for instance, but only get cards for a Shaman deck in a booster. That problem is addressed initially by the start decks which give you enough cards to start a deck for one class. Supplementing that initial starter deck, or building a new one from scratch can take a lot of booster packs to get the cards required.

RATING: 2
Rating based on one game with the 30-card preconstructed (?) decks.  Basically, I'll echo what I've read from others here: after the mulligan decision, I never experienced even a whiff of tension over any decision in the game.  My wife's helpless hero (she just wasn't drawing the weapon she needed to be able to swing back at my allies) just sat there while I pounded her into dust.  Combat could hardly have been less interesting, and there wasn't a single exciting card effect in two starter boxes (including the four boosters that came with them).  It was bizarre how difficult it was for her to get anyone to block attacks against her, so the fighting consisted of, "This ally attacks you for two"..."OK."..."Umm, so does this one"..."OK."

Give me good mechanics, like Shadowfist, L5R, VtES, or even Magic.  This sucked.

UPDATE: hahaha, 150 plays later, I guess this game is pretty solid. We fell out of it for a few years, then got back in. Still a fun game. Got some guys at work into it for a while, had a good run. I'll probably never get rid of my cards.

RATING: 9
My favorite collectable card game. While this fascination lasted in my group, it was an incredibly fun, violent, and satisfying experience. Of course, it is a game based on the luck of the draw, but part of the fun is tweaking that luck factor, manipulating it ever so much, hopefully to your favor. Creating a deck is serious work, as you need to balance the amount of quest cards in your deck with all the other types of cards, including weapons, armour, tactics, and allies. Two things that make this a true winner as a collectable card game: The artwork is outstanding, and the "manna" system is awesome. I also like the brilliant "raid" decks as well. Lastly, I do not like this game if played with more than two players without the Raid decks. Multiplayer, it becomes a "beat up on one hero and eliminate them" situation.

It's much like M:tG, but easier to get right into. Play 1 land-like card (quest) per turn. Here, though, any card may be placed face down as land. Use mana-equivalent to play creatures or instants. Player is represented by card on table, and can do stuff eventually (attack, special ability...). Combat is different: attacker picks target, and damage accumulates. You lose if you can't draw, or if your character is killed.

We played with 2 of the starter decks. It's not a bad game, although these starter decks were unevenly matched (I was slaughtered). I don't want to do a TCG, though.

Fun, borrows a lot from MTG, but with some improvements (no more mana screw!)  Battles tend to be bloodier, tracked damage on allies adds an interesting element.  Being able to place any card as a resource smooths out and removes some of the luck in match-up.

Update: With the release of Icecrown Citadel Raid set, this is now a truly self-contained boxed boardgame. 

WoW CCG is very similar to Magic the Gathering. There are a few extra features, like weapons and armor, an improved resource system, and a tweaked combat system. However, design-wise, it is generally less interesting than Magic, and the race-class system screws up drafting. 

However, WoW CCG makes up for its faults with the Raid Deck multiplayer format. Raid is a 1vsMany, semi-scripted way of playing WoW CCG that perfectly captures the theme of the PC game, and shows that you *can* have a fun boxed CCG experience. It's one of the few good ways to play a multiplayer CCG, and WoW TCG is basically worth keeping just for that.

This game resembles Magic:  The Gathering.

Okay, so we were playing a beginner dungeon and basic starter decks, but the gameplay here seemed to be basically automatic. 

Playing on a higher level, the key to success seems to be 'hope the first three attacks from the boss hit three different people'. That will allow you all time to build your resources at which point you can relatively easily overcome the boss(es). For the amount of text and information on these cards, there really isn't a lot of gameplay...

I played magic for years in my youth.  I spent tons on cards, enjoyed it for the most part.  There's many things about magic I've always hated, WoW has done an amazing job at rectifying many of these things.  No more mana screw, ability to make cards that aren't useful at that time a resource.  I love having the characters as the focal point other than 40 health or something from another player.  Some of the rules are fiddly such as the Defender and Attacker thing, but that actually creates some interesting strategy, do I attack or save him for defense, its always a tough call.  Far far far better than I thought it would be.  Production quality of the cards is a little lack luster, some cards came out with already damaged edges.  The production quality of the starters is FANTASTIC though, storage for 2 decks, 1 playable starter deck per box, giant cards, its all very good.  The art is what really suckered me in, they did an AMAZING job with these cards.  All in all a surprisingly good game, I can't WAIT to try the raid decks.  I plan to preconstruct various classes and get a raid deck making the game more as a card/boardgame than a CCG.

The topdown design makes this game obnoxious at times, and it lacks a lot of variance because of it sticking far too closely to source. The expansions have opened up the ground a bit though, and the Raid Decks are a cool idea, if not too difficult to be fun for the poor.

I'll reserve judgement on this game, but from what I understand, the marketing schemes for this game will create sales in staggering numbers.  If they can convert those buyers into players... they'll have something... but it could cave in on itself just the same.  Still, the initial set will sell like nothing else.
--Update - I played a demo, and I played in the opening weekend.  This game is essentially Magic combined with a few elements from other games (Duel Masters, Vs. etc.)  The main difference is, that even with a large base set, deck archetypes will be VERY limited.  Not only are there more "colors", but you cannot mix colors at all unless the card itself is playable in more than one color. (items, mainly)  The extreme rarity of some of the cards, as well as the unbalanced/oddly costed structure seems to show a lack of a cogent formula for card creation (in Magic terms, a 3/2 creature that can't be targeted costs 3, while a 4/1 that can't be targeted only costs 2.  While the 4/1 is more fragile, it's a LOT faster.)  Stuff like this is riddled throughout the game.  Limited only makes the problem more apparent, since over half of what you open (if you play sealed booster) will not be playable.  See, not only are there "colors" (classes) but there are also sides... light/dark (Alliance/Horde) so... 

Anyway, I want to be clear that my selection for a ratings number shows the following:

1. I am very disappointed in this release.  They should have done better.  The art is great and they spent a FORTUNE on it.  The production value of the deck box, etc. is VERY nice.  The prize support for the release weekend was a JOKE.  Dicebag with gems?  Gems that you could buy for a dollar?  Pathetic. This will make SO much money, they could have done better.

2. I'm tired of 15-20 minute games.  That's all that seems to come out these days.  

3. I'm just not interested in playing this TCG at all.  I like CCG's, and I like World of Warcraft.  I think this is a poor thematic reflection of both.

4. Since this game is basically Magic Vs... it should have been better than either game, and in my opinion it fails to beat either game.  I no longer play either of those games either, they just don't satisfy my gaming tastes at all.  I'll still play Magic sealed and online... I like Magic enough... but this game falls way short for me.  Sorry.
----------
UPDATE 2 - 
I must admit, after taking another look at the game, 5 sets in... it's a lot stronger than it was when it started, at least from a design perspective.

I still think the game lacks what it needs to be an true adaptation of World of Warcraft... but it's a solid game (and would be regardless of the license/theme).

The redemption cards are VERY powerful, and very hard to get.

Anyway, I'll keetp checkin in... but it's getting better.

While I plan on avoiding all CCG's from now on so that I don't end up spending lots of money on them like I did with Magic a while back, I enjoyed trying it out.  It's very similar to Magic, although I actually think the combat system may be better.  Being able to attack particular units rather than simply attacking generally makes a lot of difference and adds a layer of strategy that provides players with some interesting decisions.

I enjoyed the mechanics and the relation to the MMORPG, which I played for quite a while.  But the lack of other players interested in playing who aren't gung-ho-buy-a-zillion-card types makes it pretty much a waste to have.

This game reminds me of the old days in Magic (the early 90s).  I haven't touched any other card game since Ice age and now here i am eagerly awaiting what other cards I can get.  The gameplay is really good and keeps to the WoW theme.  Fantastic game for starter gamers as well in my opinion. Easy to learn.

Interesting CCG with streamlined mechanics and good artwork. Like some of the other BGG-ers stated, it is indeed very similar to Magic, but the fact that each of your handcards doubles as a resource card ("land") makes it less luck dependent (and therefore better in my opinion). Even with the later sets, I am not very happy with the distribution of cards however. It seems that there are more "destroy equipment" than equipment cards for example (and your hero can only attack when he owns such a card). Looking forward to playing it with a Raid deck (co-op agains GM).

Interesting take on World of Warcraft through CCG. The system is a compilation of several different CCGs. Combat is very comparable to Magic: The Gathering, Resources are based on the VS. games, and victory conditions are met by defeating an actual in game representation a la Magi-nation. Interesting indeed but I'm not in to the CCG craze as I used to be.

I'm always on a quest to find an affordable CCG, and WoW captures the feel of the online game pretty well. Probably up there with the defunct Battletech CCG, but it gets more points because, well, it's not defunct :)

Edit: Now that Hearthstone's out, just play that instead!

The WoW TCG is a joke.  It's just a bit of merchandising to make money.  Can't really fault a company for wanting to make money, but you can 'fault' those who bother playing it.  You say you like the game?  How about playing the FULL game?  It's called VS CCG.  Now that's a GREAT CCG.  Upper Deck owns both games so it's not like they actually 'stole' anything.  They simply took a successful game, stripped out a lot of what made it successful (i.e. formations and everything involved with them) and then re-themed it.  It's probably good for attracting kids and WoW fans to CCGs though.

Doesn't seem to be as deep as Magic, but I think is more fun for a casual player, as it fixes the problem of mana screw. Deck building is less interesting than Magic, and I doubt drafting is good due to the class limitations of the cards. I look forward to trying the raid decks.

This is actually the only CCG that I've ever played, so I probably shouldn't have given it a rating.  

I played this several of times with friends who are experienced CCG gamers, and they've convinced me that this is one of the best.  Someday, I may get into CCGs, but I'm hoping that I can stay relative free of that world. :)

RATING: 5
[gameid=463] with a twist.  A little faster playing and a bit more granular with many different ways to build a deck.  Instead of merely colors, you have classes and alliances to figure in as well.  The resources mechanic is clever, and simultaneously eliminates land lock, and gives you another simple tweak to make to your deck.  The gameplay and deckbuilding principles are very similar, though.  Make a fast deck that has a good balance of anti-whatever your opponent is playing with a smattering of powerful expensive cards to save your bacon if the game goes long.  The raid decks do look interesting, but I've never tried one.

Solid card game. I think it plays better as a raid style game opposed to head to head. It can feel pretty brutal at times. You don't need to play the PC game to enjoy the card game. It's not a game I would want to play all of the time as I could see it getting stale very quickly.

A Magic the Gathering inspired design with new mechanisms that address some of the older game's more frustrating aspects. The mana system allows any card to be placed as a resource, which adds deck space and more importantly prevents mana screw. Magic veterans will recognize many of the concepts, such as cards that act as sorceries, instants, creatures and enchantments, all are present in this game's design. 

Another benefit of WoWTCG is the approach to deck building. The avatar system, in which a card physically represents the player's hero, is one of the games biggest innovations. It allows players to have variable starting life totals and differing deck building restrictions, both of which add variety to match-ups. The fairly loose two color (faction) system opens up far more deck design possibilities than Magic and makes creature based combo decks easier to pull off. There are so many options among class, race, and faction that deck building is almost as fun as playing the game!

There are also a lot of entertaining things such as famous pop-culture characters (Leroy Jenkins, Southpark's "He Who Has No Life"), as well as real quests and loot found in the MMO game. While the TCG doesn't really attempt to recreate the RPG aspect of the World of Warcraft, the spells and abilities do a fairly good job of reflecting their online counterparts. It's not a direct translation, but at the very least the game feels like a PVP fight. Despite the fact there aren't any mobs to fight or levels to grind, it does still feel like Warcraft.

This is absolutely the most satisfying TCG I have ever played. The expansion sets have been solid, decks keep evolving, and we keep on playing. Great effort.

RECOMMENDED VARIANTS: We like to play three booster sealed games using the following simple rules.

1. Open up three packs of cards per player.

2. Remove the Points/Crafting card and Hero or Loot card.

3. Without looking at them, shuffle the remaining cards together to form a deck.

4. Each player's hero is considered to be a 30 health character belonging to all classes and factions that meets all talent and loyalty requirements.

5. Play otherwise proceeds as normal.

Sound like it wouldn't work? It does, and surprisingly well. We first played this format at Gen Con and our entire group had a blast. Give it a try!

Bought a couple starters and boosters for this game when I was into WoW on the PC.  It was okay but expansions came faster than I was willing to spend money on it and never really pursued it.  WoW has lured me back 3 times so far, and each time I've "gotten clean"  I actually still have an unused time card in my computer room.  will likely never paly these cards again.  Or the PC game.

Good game, played about 3 times. 

Comparing to MTG - I like few fresh (for me) ideas: hero and his class, using any card as resource, quests for drawing more card. But (as far as I played) a little bit to simple for me, to little of contriving, just simple fight. Maybe I should try another classes of heroes?

RATING: 7
Very similar to Magic the Gathering, but for my group its a heck of a lot more fun to play.  I should add that one of the aspects that makes this game truly unique is the inclusion of raid encounters.

In a raid, a group of players work together to defeat the bosses of a dungeon controlled by an opposing player.  Its very tough and victory is never assured.    Its probably my favorite aspect of WoW and something that really sets it apart from all other CCG's that I have played.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It seems as though the designers took some parts of Vs., some parts of Magic and some parts of a CCG not designed yet and came up with the WoW CCG.  It's certainly not a bad game and there is some strategy in the gameplay, but not nearly as much as I'm used to with The Spoils.  Plus, it kills me that you can't utilize unused resources to draw like you can in Spoils.  Other than that, it's fun...for now. :)

RATING: 7
Improved Magic the Gathering. Still basically the same game as Magic, but it solves the issues involved with Mana Screw and makes Mana itself more interesting, while also throwing your hero into the forefront of the battle which makes things more thematic and fun. The fact that there are 10 different types of heroes instead of just 5 colors is also a big plus, and they all feel different. The downsides are the fact that it didn't become very popular (most of the people who bought it seem to have just been video gamers interested in the novelty cards) and the fact that it was sold in random collectible boosters rather than fixed sets.

I like the resource trade-off mechanic, and the art is fantastic. Not a deep game, and lack of cards can make for boring play, but reminds me of the beginning days of Magic, simple fun. I can see where numerous problems could arise with uber deck contruction, but luckily I don't try to make or play against super-competitive decks.

Future rules additions (talent specs, professions, etc.) could turn this thing into a beast fast. And dang, you would really have to buy a LOT of cards, or spend money on singles, to get into this seriously; there's so many cards that will be useless to you.

RATING: 9
WoW has some similarities to Magic's more creature-based moments.  The rules are more streamlined and games aren't generally lost on Mana-screw.  The integrated attack "phase" and damage that stays on creatures and heros means the game play is much more tactical than in other CCGS.  I'm also a fan of the hero "avatars" which provide more flavor and raison d'etre than MTG's "you are a random wizard and you start with 20 life."   The more I play this game, the more I've come to love it.  With several sets out now, there are some really wonderful options for thematic deck building.  The magic bullet design (i.e.; tons of removal of all types)means UDE can make more technically powerful cards that promote interesting interactions and not have unbeatable decks in rotation. 

Edit:  I've been playing more raids lately.  The raid decks are a nice bonus for the game and adds some incredible challenge for a group of 6.

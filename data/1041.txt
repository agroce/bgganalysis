It's definitely a good game, with a great card mechanic that I felt I had to have in my collection...but it's not one I particularly want to play.  When I want to play an area-control game I go El Grande every time.  This is a good one for 3 people though.

I need to play it again.  It was ruined by negotiation in the first play but I'm not sure it would be much better.  In any case I suspect there's a reason it hasn't been reprinted.

San Marco is brilliant... I've only played three player and wouldn't have it any other way. The fair division mechanic is excellent, and most players seem to be in the game down to the final moment. I would play this game any time, any place! Update: It's amazing how much this game can change, depending on the players involved. My first two playings with this one went quite well, but I was absolutely slaughtered during my most recent game! Some might not like that, but it just reveals more depth for me, and I continue to enjoy the challenges of San Marco.

LIKE: The mechanisms are great. Dividing and choosing of the cards is smooth and amazing, such difficult decisions. Simple area control keeps it competitive and fun.
DISLIKE: Some luck involved. Banishing people can get pretty rough. Can't be played with two. 

OVERALL: One of my favorite games. Takes a little learning with new players.

Elegant, well-thought out, deep, slightly-intellectual in terms of Strategy and Tactics and chock full of interesting mechanics. It's also great fun to play, easy to learn (but tough to master) and plays in around an hour.  It works well with 3 or 4 (though is best with 3), and is a perfect game to kick off or finish a night of serious gaming.  As well as all of those positives, it's also very pretty to look at and comes in a strong and nicely-sized box.

What's more, the more I play it, the more I appreciate it.

Delightful area control game set in and around the islands of Venice.  Plays rather like a version of El Grande Lite with the auction mechanism being replaced by a distributor (of cards) and decision-maker(s), which works quite well.  A curious difference is that there is no scoring after each of the 3 passages (which would normally be called rounds) but only after the final one.  
Enough tough choices to keep it interesting, but not so many as to drag the game out unduly.  An excellent medium-light game that I can't wait to play again and again.

One of my favorites.  I really love the I split/you choose mechanism.

RATING: 8
1st play: Excellent game and an awesome implementation of the I-split-you-choose mechanic.  I've played Rialto in the past, and I can see that it was going for a similar vibe, but San Marco does it so much better.  It might be STRONGLY best with 3 because of how the stacks are built, but a really fun, stressful game.

2nd play: Sometimes a game that has only 1 or 2 mechanics running in it can feel limited, but that's not the case here.  The "I split-You Choose" mechanism works beautifully here.  I have no idea how this game hasn't been reprinted but every round is pure tension.   Fighting for control of territories, trying not to bust over the limit and building bridges.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Wonderful game. I enjoyed the card mechanism very much, it is an area influence game played with cards, the cards are balanced and distributed by the players themselves, so with all players knowing how to balance the choices, the game is amazing. The problem lies on times when there is a player that doesn't know very well what he is doing with the cards.

San Marco definitely uses an interesting "divide the ten cards into three hands" mechanism.

But was the game fun for me? Not particularly. It seemed to lack a sweet spot, as if the game needed further development and/or refinement...except for the final turn which...curiously...seemed to deliver on the evident promise of the game. Then again, the final turn featured some major AP.  Giving it 7 of 10, February 2012.

Downgrading to a 6, February 2013 because I do not want to play it again.

good core mechanic, good art.  i played with 3, but i'm not sure how it would work with 4.  definitely had el grande feeling in the territory stuff, unlike web of power/china.  lots of opportunity for kingmaking and picking on specfic people.  somebody came up with even distribution cards for deciding who picks first for the 4-player game, maybe that would be cool with 3.  i technically don't like this game, but i'm willing to play it pretty easily, which is odd.  like maharaja i think the ratio of thought you're supposed to give it compared to how random the results are is really out of whack.  it looks like it's really bad to be an early leader in the game too.  but i dunno, i'll still play it.

Boy, there are a lot of area control games, aren't there?

In any case, I think this one suffered in my estimation because I've played so many other games, and have already found a quick area control game I like a lot (Mykerinos). Still, I'd play this again, though I think three-player might be more interesting; the one round I played where I had to split cards for three was much more interesting in the decisions I had to make.

Only one play,  but I can already see that this is the most vicious game I have met for a long time!  Definitely recommended with 3 players only.  Exceedingly difficult decisions on every turn (for every player).  Plays fairly quickly, and with almost no down time for everyone.  Superb!

(AM trade Nov-05.)  Unless I am mistaken - quite possible - in the 3 player game it is possible (as in our first game) that one player never gets to be a decision maker.  Would be better to rotate the three roles in the 3 player game.  Fairly light game, not too demanding.  (Sold Apr-06)

A beharangozó alapján egy gyér El Grande klónra számítottam, de kicsit mást kaptam: egy egész jó többségi játékot. Egy kis szabályértelmezési vita kicsit rányomta a bélyegét a játék hangulatára (egyébként a szabály egyik értelmezésével mindhárman azonos ponton végeztünk volna), de ettől függetlenül tetszett. A száműzés miatt könnyen dugába dőlhetnek a terveink, ez a szerencsefaktor kicsit talán sok. De a kártyaválasztási mechanizmus nagyon egyedi ötlet, már csak emiatt is megérte kipróbálni.

I discovered, lately in my gaming life, an unsuspected taste for area control games. I love El Grande (my preferred area control with 5 players) and Dominant Species (my go to area control with 4 players).
With San Marco, I've found the PERFECT area control game for 3 players. And probably one of the best overall 3 players game out there...

The main mechanic (other than area control) is a clever "I divide, they choose" system, with the turn player dividing the action cards in three groups, and the other two choosing first. This alone would be good, but coupled with the limit cards (that are both a timer towards the end of the round and a mean to receive bonuses) is simply AWESOME!

The game has very simple and straightforward rules, but is literally packed with hard decisions.

I wouldn't play San Marco with 4, but would like to play it almost anytime there are only 3 players at the game night!

1 play. remove the die!!! the concept is great, and without the die it would be a clear 9. make the banishment card send away fixed number, add hidden goals so the score is not exactly known, and you'd have a winner. as it is i was left after 1 hour of play with a dice roll: 1-2 i come in second, 3: i win, 4-6: i lose. you have got to be kidding me, this is kindergarden once again :-(

[i]Posted: 10/30/05, Rated: 7[/i]

A fun game, which feels a bit like "area control lite."  The available actions are determined by cards, and the mechanism for distributing cards is very cool.  It's like the old "I cut, you choose" method of sharing food when you were a kid, only this time one person divides up action cards and the "limit" cards.  If you accumulate 10 points' worth of limit cards, then you are out of the current "passage."  A game is three passages (phases?) long.

What ends up happening is that the player dividing the cards takes into account your position on the board as well as your current number of limit points.  Do you go for the quick score and risk going over the limit?  It's a great idea.

I do have a few gripes with the game.  The deck of action cards gets reshuffled after every passage.  This requirement means the scoring opportunities as well as aristocrat (cube) placement locations are going to be [i]very[/i] random.  The "banishment" action allows a player to choose a district, roll one six-sided die, and remove that number of her opponents' aristocrats from that region.  There is a bonus banishment at the end of each passage.  This action can easily thwart otherwise solid play.  There's also a large helping of "gang up on the leader," so the game doesn't come off as strategic in scope as I had hoped.

[i]San Marco[/i] is a good game to introduce the area control mechanic to new players.  The colors on the board and the cards are fantastic.  It is fun to play, but just hasn't shown enough of the "it" factor in order to be rated any higher.

The mechanic of being able to select and weight action cards vs limit cards is very clever. This game has legs for many more games to come. Good game length.

Second play perhaps shows a few more cracks but nevertheless still very clever. Game needs players of equal ability to survive as a poor card split will favour the first selector. Could be very AP prone. Needs beer and conversation to fill in the gaps.

Needs wooden bridges.

REALLY liked this game with four players, two vets and two noobs (of which I was one) it was an enjoyable title with a wonderfully realized theme, and nice components, the copy I played was imported from Germany as the owner could not find it in print here in the states, he paid a premium, but it was worth EVERY penny! wonderful game that will be high on my watch list from now on. The tactics are subtle and refined but brutal, and the "hook" mechanic of the card split is pure brilliance!

Based on the score and how much this game haunts my post Con thoughts, I have to give this the nod over La Citta for my Personal Favorite of show, and it is OH so close, Almost to close to call for one two and three for me. However a decent part of my score HAS been how much I play the game and my group likes it, in the cases of these new ones it can only be for now, how much I think we would play them, and this is the ONLY one of the group, that I can say without a doubt we would play again and again...so it gets the nine and the coveted best in show from me. This is such an elegant board game that pictures and descriptions only get you so close, if you get the rare option to purchase or play this one, try not to pass it up.

I think this could be the best 3 player game in my collection (Carolus Magnus gives it a run).  At first, I thought this was an El Grande junior, but I think it is much more than that.  In fact, the only reason it seems like El Grande is the first/second regional scoring mechanism.  I really enjoy the I split/you pick mechanism.  The last turn or two are a small letdown from the rest of the game as it all becomes more deterministic math.

Very nice game with a great playing mechanisms. The divide and choose mechanism is just brilliant and the limit cards add great strategic possibillities. Easy to learn but difficult to master as all the actions can be used in a sheer unlimeted number of combos. There are so many subtle interactions that you face agonizing choices when choosing and when dividing alike. Mostly it turns out quite even but it is possible to get struck by a string of bad luck in this game.

There is a small amount of leader bashing and randomization with the dice, but nothing too drastic to detract from the gameplay. 

The most interesting part of the I split, you choose mechanic are the Limit Cards. Not only do they provide a game timer and bonus points, but when split with the various offerings they provide a little suffering and pain along with getting the  cards. Usually, if you want the most valuable cards, they come along with a higher price.

The consensus is that San Marco plays best at three and I would agree.

Initial rating. This will probably rise when (if) I play it more...first game was a bit harsh, because I'm not terribly good at thinking on my feet, so divvying up the cards was a real nightmare of shame for me, as I made some really lopsided offers that gave strong positions to other players. Still, I'd like to try it again, so that must mean something....

Pretty simple area majority game that seems to work well with 3 players.  In my one play, I made poor decisions that stuck me in a spot where I was basically the third player in a two player game.  Nonetheless, I like the mechanic of one player sorting cards into piles for all players to pick one pile.  It's a good game despite the fact that my first effort was poor.

Second play went better.  Still feel it's a good once-in-a-while game.

A solid area majority game with an interesting 'I cut, you choose' mechanic that allows you to trade immediate gain or position for penalty points. Had some tough decisions but I would have liked a better mechanic for deciding who cut and who chose, I seemed to spend most of the game cutting.

RATING: 8
Not sure about this one.  It was decent but when two doge came up, they were usually packaged with the majority of the points so that someone could score twice, but gave up the other points.  Yeah, it made for tough decisions, but the game quite anti-climatic and really, because of that, the luck of the first distribution played a huge role.  It's a six right now and willing to try again.

Update June 2011 - tried again after a few years with different people.   Bumped to an 8. A quick game with very tough decisions.  It was tight.  Some of the issues I noted above didn't happen.  I guess they could have but it just felt different.  I'm not sure what four would be like but I think it's a great three player game.

A fun game in the El Grande mold, but much more chaotic and wacky.  It's far too easy to bash the leader, making the outcome too random.  The card division is a nice idea, but sometimes it can be an intractable problem that slow players will analyze forever.

An okay game that's essentially a majorities game built on a single mechanic best described as "I divide, you decide"... just too slow for my taste due to the amazing number of calculations and decisions involved in splitting the cards (esp. in the 3-player game).

As a 3 player game this is probably one of the best lighter games you can get. The rules can be explained in less than 5 minutes. The I split and you two choose puts the game in a wonderful balance and the game tends to be tight until the end. There is not real overall strategy you can follow, you just have to take it as it comes. I love the art on the board. With 4 players it's less fun but still pretty decent although I would prefer to play something else. The two player version doesn't appeal to me.

Enjoyable gaming experience with dividing of actions for all players by the player with the intiative. The key is to provide the deciders with obvious decisions, and make your actions available. The fun is it will not always work out the way you want. A little chaos is added with the banishment action, which has potential to make a big swing in one district - but it is only one district, and may not play out if the roll is low. "The Doge is a lure," one player said, and I think he is right - need to have good placement over all the board. Overall a nice change of pace and enjoyable tactical game of area control. Rated for the 3 player game. Plays well with 4 also.

RATING: 7.5
El Grande's chaotic cousin.

Area control with some reminescence of El Grande. However, the mechanism of dividing the cards into separate packets is very unique. The decision making can sometimes be excrutiating.

Games can turn very quickly from leader-bashing, banishments cards or from even one packet that is grossly imbalanced. 

Two serious criticisms of this game: the initial cube placement is at the mercy of 4 dice throws. Very imbalanced if you end up with 6 cubes in one territory. Second, is the banishment card. It can be too powerful. I was recently in a game in which one player threw 3 sixes on their banishment cards while another player threw 3 ones on theirs. Not much strategy there. Games may not be won or lost on merit.

Plays well as a 3 or 4 player game, though I prefer the 4.

The art is attractive.

Update: San Marco has been fired. Play Shitenno instead...the same split the pie mechanic, but a lot less chaos.

It's fun to explore older titels which are classics which is the case with San Marco for me. I do love area majority and expectations were high with the game.

I liked the simplicity and fluent game play as well as the graphic design. Unfortunately I did not find the game that engaging and desisions in the game felt quite arbitrary to me. There's also very direct confrontation between players which is "old school" and was a bit too much in your face even for me (I tend to prefer this sort of things in games).

All in all a fun visit to the past but there are other games which have replaced San Marco in it's genre.

1 play.  I quite liked it, especially how streamlined and elegant it is.  Simple rules leading to lots of decisions & rich game play.  My one area of concern is the random turn order for First and Second Chooser.  Seems like it's possible for someone to get repeatedly hosed by always having to pick 2nd.  But I really enjoyed it and would love to play more.  Great production values too, except for the tiny cards - their artwork is fine, but the colors are a bit too similar and they're just too small.

An excellent game that's just not my style. Like with El Grande, I'm just not a big fan of these cube-pushing area-control games. You put cubes into green. I put some into blue. Johnny takes some of yours out of green. I put one into each. etc. etc. etc. It's just so monotonous.

Yes, there's more interaction and conflict than in many modern Euro games. That does not necessarily make a game better if the whole game is just the same repeated actions over and over again. A little more variety in ways to score would improve this immensely. As it stands, the game just feels dated to me.

RATING: 6
Rating based on playing with 3 players.  I like the "I divide, you choose" mechanic, but the overall game is merely OK.  The game falls apart if someone makes poor choices when they are the divider, and this is likely to happen if a player does not want to put forth the effort to think through the various permutations.  The scoring opportunities being random is also problematic because the value of those cards varies greatly depending on how many of them come out in a round.  

One house rule I recommend is having the roles rotate in a fixed manner so that if Player A is the divider, Player B is the first chooser, and Player C is the second chooser, then in the next round Player C is the divider, Player A is the first chooser, and Player B is the second chooser (and so on).  It takes out the randomly chosen order for the choosers and evens things out.

I rate the game a "4" for 4-players.  The problem with the 4-player game is that the second divider is a difficult job - the board will change before your piles are executed, so you can end up unintentionally giving your chooser a lop-sided cut which helps them and hurts you.  Since the second divider position is determined randomly, if you end up in that spot a disproportionate number of times you will probably lose the game.  This can be mitigated by using a similar house rule to what I mentioned above (having the roles rotate in a fixed manner) or by letting the second divider wait until the first divider/chooser pair has taken their turns before dividing up their own cards (which adds too much length to the game for my taste), but I still prefer the 3-player game

An almost totally bland, uninspired design, the problem here is that each player has one of two roles each turn - divider or chooser - and the "chooser" has very little control over the flow of the game. Since the roles are not divvied up equally, this can present a fairly serioius problem.

Watered down El Grande with a couple of neat mechanics thrown in for spice.  I like the card-division mechanic, but I was lucky to play with quick thinkers.

I also enjoy how the bridges keep you fluid.  In some respects, they help you hold on to what you have already claimed.  But there are other cards which can just as easily take it away, specifically the traitor and banish cards.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Very interesting and unique with the "I split, you choose" mechanism that drives the game. Stands up to repeat plays, as player choices combined with card mixes make the game very different every playing.

The main downsides of the game, however, are the potential for AP in players that are prone to it, and also the possibility for some weird end-game kingmaker situations. As in most area majority games, the board state can be very very swingy, and the game features many cards that make this even more so, in a way that may throw the game one way or the other.

Overall, I still enjoy the game since it's fairly unique, but still simple, but it also has its downsides.

Based on 1 play with 3 players:

Delightful! It's been awhile since I liked a game this much on the first play.

The I split, you choose mechanic is GREAT and makes for some super tough decisions, both as the splitter and the chooser. The limit cards are a brilliant way to make these decisions agonizing.

The only cause for concern is there's a not-insignificant luck factor here due to the choosing order and the fact that scoring only happens when someone plays the right card. But the game was short and fun enough that this didn't really bother me.

Also... I see no real reason that you MUST have the cards face-down when splitting. I guess they were concerned the splitter might rearrange the piles based on the choosers' reactions, but I don't think it's that big of a deal. It's more dramatic when they're face-up.

The mechanic of you dividing the cards and then selecting as the very last person yourself is awesome! It is an area majority game like El Grande, but it works very fine for 3 players. However, I would still prefer to play El Grande if I had 4+ players to a game night, and if I had 3 people there are just so many other great games to play. However, it gets a good grade as it's one of the few area majority games which actually works with 3 players, so if you're looking for a game like that, go get it!

In fact, the game seems to be a series of self-inflicted wounds as the other humans at the table don't act as you'd hoped. Sometimes it's just relaxing to be second picker.

Trying to divide up the stacks of cards into lots can be agonizing, but its the best kind of agony.

RATING: 8
San Marco is an area influence game that plays particularly well with 3 at the table. Each round action and limit point cards are dealt out. Limit point cards are 1-3 inclusive. Action cards allow the placement of pieces, replacing an opponents piece with another, banishing 1-6 pieces from an area, placing a bridge, and scoring. One player, which rotates each round, divides the cards into 3 piles. (again, all of this assuming 3 players, the only way I play this game) The other players each select a pile, leaving the divider with the last. They then execute their actions. This keeps going until someone goes to 10+ limit points, and then the round ends. The player with the fewest limit points gets bonus points based on the difference between their limit point total and the player with the most, and gets a bonus banish action. The next round continues. This happens 3 times, and then there is a final scoring.

In the normal course of play, scorings only happen when the Doge action card is selected. This allows the player selecting it to move the scoring pawn to an area of their choice, where simple cube majority results in 1st/2nd place scoring, with some areas being very tight (i.e.: 6/5 for first second) and others much more spread out (i.e.: 7/4). The doge has to use bridges to move around. If you own the bridge, it's obviously free. If someone else does, you have to pay them a VP to use it. Hence, having a few well-placed bridges can be useful. They also give you more leeway when you take action cards, as you can use your own bridges to place pieces in an adjacent area.

This game is made by the card selection mechanic. The creation of the piles and the selection of them is really the entire game. It's a brilliant mechanic that creates some interesting decision space, provided that the players can avoid horrible analysis paralysis. The game can sometimes be swingy based on the banish actions (which remove 1-6 pieces based on a die roll) but that's expected for the designer. Overall, I really enjoy this game, and it's definitely my favourite AIG with 3 at the table. It can be played with 4, but it looks like it wouldn't be nearly as good, and virtually all other AIG play extremely well with 4, so I don't see the point of bringing it out with that many at the table.

On an aside: it really irks me when people say that the cards makes this game all that random or light. The Solomon draft mechanic means that proper pile division will carry the day in almost any circumstance, and there is a strong element of psychology in this game as well...by tailoring the piles correctly, one can tempt the opposition into taking things that might not be in their best interest, all the while furthering one's own position. Banish actions do have variable returns that can swing the game when it's tight, but that's the only real part of this game that I see as random, and I think the best way to approach them is to assume the worst: always assume the opponent is going to roll what they want and that you're going to get the opposite of what you want.

Really solid area control game. Thought I was going to come dead last in our first game, but the power used by the lowest limit player in the last turn helped me into second. My early round scoring also helped when there was less available scoring in the later rounds due to the card which came out. 

The card choosing mechanic is something I haven't seen before and I really enjoyed it. 

This game has a lot of depth. The components are also quite nice.

San Marco is a majority game with a fairly unique divide-and-chose mechanism. One person divides a set of cards, the other person gets to chose first. This makes interaction a very obligatory and sometimes quite tricky process. I've read some accounts of people succumbing to analysis paralysis, but honestly, I can't figure out why. The in my opinion great thing is that interaction is limited to one player most of the time, namely the person you share the cards with. Although with 2 players the game is more predictable and less chaotic than with 4, I think the levels in the latter game are more than acceptable to keep it fun and interesting. If I compare it to El Grande, San Marco doesn't have such a large decision space to work out, and has a quicker and less heavy feel to it. The fact that there is some randomness involved also helps in losening up the entire process. I like this game consideraby.

Upon repeated plays, I've come to the conclusion that with 4, it becomes a mite chaotic. It is still a very good game, and lightyears better than El Grande (another chaotic majority game), because there you continually evaluate your decision space—in other words, introducing strategy in a game where strategy is hard to find in the first place. Not so in San Marco. Still, the game is still hard to control with 4, and gameplay suffers somewhat because of this. It is a very good game you can have lots of fun with, but for the 8 which I originally envisaged, it lacks in small, but noticable ways. They can all be summarised as 'lack of control', a typical characteristic of Alan Moon.

This reminded me of how I used to share cake with my brothers. One person had to cut the cake in four slices

gets last choice. Splendid at what it seeks to accomplish. Have not played "Piece of Cake" but would love to try it out since it destills this mechanic even
more.

Components: Quality components, with plastic bridges and an attractive collage decorating each district (in a style similar to Torres). The card artwork is both functional and visually appealing.

Experience: As a territory-control game, perhaps there isn't anything new here, though with only three players and not too many districts, it feels less cluttered to me than others with the same mechanism. But the truly delicious part of the game is the card distribution. In order to distribute the cards but be awarded with the group I want, I must make the other piles attractive to specific players, which is as enjoyable as it is agonizing. There are huge swings of luck, in the cards, in the order of selection, in how other players value the lots, and in the dice rolls. But it's just fun. The Doge is running all over town scoring points, using bridges; aristocrats are flocking to the desirable areas, only to be banished. And then toward the end of the game it just becomes painfully obvious which districts are lost.

I have only played this as a three-player game, and found that it works perfectly well this way.

This game is an area control game and was an OK experience.  I probably wouldn't choose to play it on my own, but would be willing to play with somebody that really liked it.  It can suffer from a bit of luck.  I got lucky and was often the first person to choose cards after the dealer put them in the 3 piles for the 3 players.  This gave me an advantage.  Also the game allows opponents to pick on the player in the lead or just pick on the person they know is good at that type of game.  I never like that aspect of a game.

The card dividing rules make for very tough choices for not only the distributor, but also the players who choose a stack of cards first. I can see why some call this El Grande light. It's a great 3 player alternative to El Grande. I would still rather play El Grande with 4 or 5 players over this though. 

Oh, and DO NOT play this with any player who struggles with analysis paralysis. He will take forever to divide the card selections.

Date approximative du texte: 2001

Dans San Marco chaque joueur incarne une famille aristocratique qui cherche à obtenir une influence maximale sur l’île de Venise en y plaçant ses nobles. Chacun des six quartiers de l’île rapporte un gain en point de prestige pour le premier et le second qui auront placé le plus de nobles. Celui qui en obtient le plus en fin de partie est déclaré vainqueur.
Nous avons donc affaire à un jeu de majorité dans la veine du fameux El Grande, où il faut savoir placer judicieusement ses petits cubes de bois.
Attention : ce jeu prévu pour trois ou quatre n’est réellement bon qu’à trois joueurs. Tout ce qui suit concerne le jeu à trois.
Après une phase de pose aléatoire qui sert à donner une configuration de départ, le jeu se construit sur un principe plutôt vicieux. Les actions sur le plateau (placement d’un noble, déplacement, suppression…)se font par des cartes et tout l’intérêt du jeu réside dans leur distribution.

Le jeu
A trois joueurs, un joueur est désigné aléatoirement comme le Donneur, un autre joueur comme le Premier Sélectionneur et le dernier joueur sera le Second Sélectionneur. Le Donneur pioche 6 cartes action et 4 cartes pénalité qu’il répartit librement en trois tas visibles. Le Premier Sélectionneur prendra le tas qu’il veut, le Second Sélectionneur aura encore deux choix disponible et le Donneur prendra le tas restant. Pour corser la difficulté il y a des cartes pénalité de valeur 1, 2 ou 3. Dés qu’un joueur prend un des paquets, il expose devant lui face visible la ou les cartes pénalité et exécute les cartes action dans l’ordre qu’il veut.

Le jeu se joue en trois manches. Si à la fin d’un tour un seul joueur a 10 ou plus points de pénalité, les deux autres joueurs disputent un tour supplémentaire avec 5 cartes action et 3 cartes pénalité puis la manche se termine. S’il y a plus d’un joueur a atteindre les 10 points, la manche est terminée dés la fin du tour en cours.
En fin de manche des bonus de points de prestige sont attribués: chaque joueur qui possède moins de 10 point de pénalité gagne la différence entre le plus grand nombre de point de pénalité et le sien. Enfin le joueur qui a le moins de point de pénalité a en outre le droit d’effectuer une action exil. Si il y égalité entre deux joueurs ce bonus n’est pas attribué.
La manche suivante commence avec toutes les cartes.
A la fin de la troisième et dernière manche, après les bonus éventuels, un dernier décompte a lieu dans chaque quartier.
Note: à chaque décompte s’il y a une égalité, les joueurs marquent le score de rang inférieur par exemple si deux joueurs arrivent en deuxième position sur un quartier ils ne marquent aucun point

Les différentes cartes action
Carte quartier : placez un noble dans le quartier ou dans un quartier adjacent s’il peut emprunter un seul de ses propres ponts.
Carte traître : remplacez un noble adverse par un des votre.
Carte pont : placez un pont entre deux quartiers voisins. Si tous les ponts sont posés il faut déplacer un des ses propres ponts.
Carte exil : lancer un dé pour éliminer autant de noble. Attention s’il n’y a pas assez de noble adverses les votre sont exilés à leur tour.
Carte doge : le pion doge entre en jeu quand la première carte doge est jouée, le joueur choisit dans quel quartier il le place et un décompte (uniquement dans le quartier concerné) est effectué. Lorsqu’une autre carte doge est jouée par la suite, le joueur peut s’il le veut déplacer le doge vers un autre quartier adjacent. Ce déplacement est gratuit s’il emprunte un pont lui appartenant mais coûte 1pt de prestige s’il passe par un pont adverse ( -1 pour vous +1 pour lui). S’il n’y a pas de pont entre les deux quartiers adjacents le coût est de 2 points de prestige.

Mon opinion
Si les règles sont bien plus simples que celles d’El Grande ce n’est pas au détriment du plaisir de jeu. Les choix sont cornéliens et tous les paramètres essentiels. Configuration du plateau, présence de ponts, pénalité des autres joueurs, autant dire que la tache du Donneur n’est pas facile surtout si il espère récupérer une carte précise. Car comment évaluer en terme de point de pénalité une carte qui va donner par exemple une majorité définitive à un joueur ? Chaque erreur est rapidement sanctionnée et croyez moi cela a un effet des plus pédagogique.
San Marco possède à mon avis une grande qualité, c’est un jeu qui s’équilibre de lui même. Avec son système de point de pénalité nul besoin d’avoir recours à des ajustements qui sont autant d’exceptions à la règle.
Mais le jeu a un défaut majeur lorsqu’il est joué à quatre joueurs soit avec deux donneurs et deux sélectionneurs. La différence de pioche des deux sélectionneurs peut être si importante (bonnes cartes action et pénalité de 1, cartes action moyennes et pénalité de 3) qu’elle sabote la partie. Il est possible de l’atténuer en constituant deux pioches identiques, mais le tirage de quartiers et d’actions décisives à un moment de la partie reste toujours un problème.
D’autre part dans la règle, le donneur est tiré au hasard, c’est un peu gênant quand on sait que le Donneur choisit toujours en dernier aussi je vous propose de suivre la progression suivante
1- Donneur :A, 1er Sélectionneur : B, 2eme Sélectionneur : C
2- C,A,B
3- B,C,A
Personnellement je joue à San Marco uniquement à 3 joueurs, je trouve que c’est un excellent jeu et même un des meilleurs dans cette configuration. La mécanique est naturelle, les parties sont tendues mais jamais poussives.Toutefois il faut avouer que le jeu est chaotique et qu'il est trés difficile d'anticiper l'évolution de la partie.

I like influence games and I also enjoy the new mechanism this game brings (Divvy up the randomly drawn cards into 2 stacks. Another player chooses one stack and you get the other.) Unfortunately, this key decision point is done in isolation while all the other players wait (and then wait some more while another player chooses which stack they want). While it can be streamlined a bit, it adds up to a game with a lot of downtime. Breakout a copy of El Grande instead.

Card splitting is an interesting idea, but the underlying area-majority game has some problems, among which is that the better players will get picked on instead of rewarded. A better game with this mechanism is likely to come along.

Haven't quite made my mind up on this one yet. The mechanics are clever - particularly the one person divides and the other selects.

Another Alan Moon El Grande-like game where you chaotically move bits around and score at intervals (lately seen in Mammoth Hunters).  Clever slice-the-pie card selection mechanic, but any thought that goes into this is tossed out on the next turn as you can literally have nothing left on the game board next time you get to play.  Basically, a stinker dressed up with one neat idea.

A particularly uninspired appropriation of El Grande by Moon. Apparently a Moon favorite by estimates. In this one, there are several mechanics that tie the players together at the ankle to assure that you have little room for maneuver. Taking advantage of inexperienced players seems the best route to vitory. Not exactly fun either. Gets rated up to a three because the board is very very pretty.

San Marco is very similiar to El Grande. I own also El Grande. I am very happy of owning both games. They are different in their own ways which justify owning both games. Number of players is one of them. 

Lately, I have played a whole lot more often El Grande than San Marco. Between the two the games, I prefer El Grande.

I still find San Marco interesting in its own way and looking forward to the next time San Marco hits the table again. San Marco excels with 3 players.

In San Marco, making two or three piles of cards can be really hard at times. Trying to make the piles of cards even as possible not to give a huge advantage over one pile or the other, (and being stuck with the crappy pile) is great.

Of course, some cards are more interesting than others. Each card has it uses. One of my first euro games in my board game collection. One of the other first is Reiner Knizia's Samurai.

I'm surprised that this mechanic hasn't been used more. It is the cards that really make the game, whereas the board play is a bit pedestrian. I would imagine that there's a reason to that and a more complicated scoring would make the choices in card dividing and choosing less acute rather than more.

2014-12-11 : Highly tactical area influence game that despite its age is still very playable and gives a fast, entertaining game. However, there are a few niggles which reduce the score from an 8 to a 7, chief among them is the total lack of a strategic element to the game - you make the best of what you get without the possibility of having an overarching strategy. The second niggle is the total randomness in the initial placement phase which is highly important, so house rule : each player places 2 cubes in an area, go around 4 times.

Decent majority control game, good for three. The "I divide, you choose" mechanic is interesting, but can be prone to big-time analysis paralysis. Strip away that concept, though, and it's a pretty average majority control game.

San Marco, for those that do not know, is an Area Majority game that uses the "I Split, You Choose" game mechanism.  I personally love it and wish more games used it.  Players will take turns splitting Action and Limit cards into piles equal to the number of players.  The action cards are what's used to get your cubes onto the various regions, take away opponents cubes, or score regions.  Limit cards are negative cards that compile over the rounds.  When someone exceeds a combined value of 10 limit points, that will trigger the end a phase (the game is played over 3).  That said, if there is more than 1 person who has less than 10 Limit points, they will do a final round before the end of the phase with the people exceeding 10 sitting out.  At the end of the phase, people can potentially score victory points and kill opponents cubes if they have less than 10 Limit points.  At the end of 3 phases all regions are scored ala El Grande style scoring (ie all regions).  This game is not as complex as El Grande (which in truth is not that complex to begin with) but it does fill a niche: 3-player area majority with a really fun and unique game mechanism.  It certainly fills the niche of that game mechanism better than Piece O Cake, in my opinion.

All in all, your time would be better spent on another game.  Rating: 5.

A great three player game that is full of interesting, rich decisions, but is also full of waiting. Still, the good heavily outweighs the bad and creates a strong three player area control game. Innovative mechanics, easy rules (within a really crappy rulebook), and great components. A gem from Moon and Weissblum.

So-so game. It works, sort of, and is relatively quick. Basically a straightforward area-control game with some interesting bits. My main criticism is that you feel the game is playing you rather than you playing the game - the watchword is "illusion of choice".

When I think of area control games, I think of El Grande. And boredom. 

San Marco, on the other hand, is fun! From the beautiful, colourful board to the awesome Doge piece to the cute li'l bridges, this game is just begging you to play it. And when you do, it doesn't disappoint. The core mechanic - one player dividing the cards for the others to choose - creates excellent tension, and much mind-blowing for the divider. Refreshingly simple and easy to teach, the one thing that brings this game down for me is that it one early mistake often dooms you, as it's not easy to reel in the leader once they're more than a few points ahead.

Only recommended as a 3-player game.  In that format, it works very well.  There is a "stop the leader" aspect, but stopping the leader is a tricky thing to do.  The fact that two 2nd places is better than a 1st and a 3rd is an important reason this game works as well as it does.

(3-4 players) I really like the "I divide, you pick" card distribution mechanism. It makes for deliciously painful decisions and is pretty much the core of the fun in the game. Only really comparable to El Grande in that they are both area majority games, otherwise this is fairly unique.  Not sure about the bridge limit in a 3 player game. It seems like the bridge limit should be decreased by one (to two bridges maximum) per connection in that scenario since scarcity never seems to become an issue.

[downgraded]
Don't like that your board position doesn't stray much at all from initial seeded positions. Minor push/pull over the course of the game but no recurring opportunities to compete in areas in which you do not start. So ultimately, the nifty card division mechanic is not enough of a reason to keep playing this. I need more.

Decisions, decisions, decisions.  One of the best games for 3 players!  An area control game that uses a very neat system where one player divides the cards while the others get to take 1st pick.  This leads to some very tough choices (and involves the most thinking).  The game moves along fairly quickly, and it's fun to watch the final scoring.  Grade: B+

The artwork of this game is fantastic, it is light hearted and whimsical but beautiful.  I only wish it had full sized cards.  I'm a fan of area control games and San Marco has it's own flavor and niche.  It's not as flexible as El Grande in handling different numbers of players but with three it is a fine game.  I really like the look and colors of the  game when it's all set up.  I've mostly played three player, which is great.  Splitting the cards is fun and has a fresh feel.  I'm finding I really like Alan Moon games.  I need to play it again soon!

Régóta vágytam egy "te osztasz én választok" mechanikájú játékra, mivel egyszerű ám nagyszerű működési elvnek gondoltam mindig is. A San Marco pont megfelelő volt ennek a kipróbálására. A játék szabályai viszonylag egyszerűek, a játék gyors, pörgős. Egyedül az elosztásnál lehet kicsit többet szöszölni, de ez nem zavaró, mert azért ilyenkor is van min tűnödni a passzív játékosoknak is.
A játékban Velence különböző területein kell többséget szerezni a megfelelő pillanatokban, illetve a területek között hidatak építgetni (ettől lesz látványos a tábla :) ). Mindezeket kártyák kijátszásával érhetjük el. Igen ám, de a véletlenszerűen kihúzott kártyákat mindig az egyik játékosnak kell szétosztani kupacokba, mely kupacok közül a többi játékos választ. A szétosztást segítik a büntikártyák, amiket az esetleges jobb lapkombinációk mellé lehet pakolni sok szeretettel.

San Marco does not require intense calculation of future moves, but does provide interesting options to consider as you try to balance (or unbalance) the card draw into three piles.  It's great fun to measure how much to poison the well so that the next player will still take the card he wants, but regret doing so (as an aside, this is the same delicious feeling I love so much from 2 player Ra or Razzia). 

Great mechanic.  Lovely looking board.  Highly recommended!

I split, you choose with a strong spatial component. I'm a little surprised that this remains a highly sought after title while the fairly recent Shitenno that it shares many traits with has made nary a splash on here.

Both are area majority games based on the same mechanism of dividing a set of cards, with the clear danger of long downtimes as one player ponders the best setup. The most obvious difference is in the map play that Shitenno does away with completely. San Marco is also the more chaotic game due to the nature of its actions.

As some have commented, a simpler El Grande, played out on a gorgeous map of Venice. Admirable for the simple fact that the game provides some deep strategy, yet is so streamlined with simple mechanics and one can learn how to play in minutes. Great I split/you pick card mechanic. The only niggle for some is that the board situation can be quite swingy, with areas often repetitively changing hands, making it difficult to plan any long term strategy. It is perfect with 3 players only. But honestly, El Grande is the better game (unless you must have 3 players).

A very nice game. In order to handle the selection order more fairly we created 6 cards. The cards have numbers on them (1,2,3,4) (1,2,4,3) (1,3,2,4) (1,3,4,2) (1,4,2,3) and (1,4,3,2). The First player each turn is number 1 and clockwise around the table sit numbers 2,3&4. First player chooses a card that determines which position each player will be in for that turn. No more hiding the buttons in your hand and then choosing them.

The "El Grande for three" description is largely accurate.  San Marco has a fascinating "I divide, you choose" mechanism for distributing power cards.  The rules are quite simple and elegant, but the decisions offered are gut-wrenchingly difficult.

The artwork is exceptional, for both the board and the power cards.

On the negative side, I dislike some of the uncontrollable random aspects.  The partially-randomized turn order seems like a needless defect, which I may try to address with a house rule.  The die roll during banishment can be frustrating, although I recognize that it adds an interesting element of risk.

An excellent area control game that is easy to learn yet with plenty of agonizing tension. Makes a great introduction to this type of game before bringing out the big guns like El Grande and Wallenstein -- though not quite as good in my book as either one of those.

Analysis paralysis can set in for 1) inexperienced players or 2) those suffering from ADD.  But the game time of 90 minutes is quite on the mark.  The card-splitting mechanics balances out luck quite nicely, however, it is important to have 4 players of equal experience (or 3, I suppose, in a 3 player game) -- this is true for many other games though, like Puerto Rico.  

Can't really tell you what is "wrong" with the game, but it wasn't captivating and exhilerating like some other of my favorite games.  it is a solid 8 in my book still though.  Great components.

An old classic masterpiece and the best Allan R Moon game to date, San Marco is a game that you will love or hate. Its mechanics are extremelly original, but some people dont understand them or they just dont like the subletly in it. San Marco is my second favourite majorities game only after El Grande, but I prefer San Marco with three players. Actually, this is the best game for three players I know. Only problem is that it needs some games to fully understand the nouances of its system. Its also getting very difficult to get, although there are some copies on Ebay, is out of stock in all the stores online or offline. I do recomend it, it is one of the most original games I had played and it looks really beautiful on the table.

Seattle gamer John Braley has already described San Marco perfectly: "This is a delicious game for masochists."

I don't play San Marco often, and I think it has something to do with the unstable balance between the exacting, excruciating card division and the capricious banishment die that often unravels all that tight planning.  Also, it's tough to shape a long-term strategy when you don't know what actions will be available next turn.  Despite those reservations, I think San Marco is a good game for three players.  I've never tried it with four, based on its reputation for being way better with three.  But a part of me wonders whether it might actually be better with four, simply because players only have to split the cards two ways rather than three.  There's just a little bit too much information to analyze when dividing three ways.

RATING: N/A
"I divide, you choose in San Marco. Best with 3 players, everyone takes turns drawing a number of action cards then creating piles for the players to select. the trick is that you want to "poison" the actions people most want, but you also want to leave something you want for yourself."

The only downside is that the game can bog down during the card distribution phase. It can be brutally difficult to separate the cards in a way that will be advantageous for you. It is hard to think through all the possible outcomes and accurately predict how the round will turn out (which should be your goal in this position).

This is a strangely, somewhat positive critique. Mostly because this process is fun! Everything else in the game works perfectly with it.

Can be frustrating if too many rounds happen without any scoring cards. But that just adds to how unique each play can be or how different each set of card draws can be.

RATING: 5
The novel mechanic of dividing cards for the other players to choose warrants agonizing decisions, leading however to some analysis paralysis if the game is taken seriously. It is very interesting, but I dislike the randomness of shuffling players' discs to determine the roles (with four players) or the choosing order (with three). The cards are played to add, remove or replace players' cubes on the map, and also to add bridges or score districts, in a chaotic area control game where it is too easy to bash the leader. The banishment action, in which you roll the die and remove the corresponding number of cubes from a district, adds a huge amount of luck. The game also has a common characteristic of other designs from Alan Moon, like "Oasis" and "Mammoth Hunters": simple enough to be played by families but more suited for serious gamers, given how easy it is to be ruined by bad moves that benefit an opponent.

Quite good, going to give it another try, I think I like it, but not sure.  It's different, unusual, sort of grabbed me, but not quite.

 The "I divide-you choose" mechanism is brilliant.  There are a lot of people who find it best with 3: I prefer a 4 player configuration.

[Initial Impression: 6] A decent area-influence game, made appealing by an interesting "I divide, you choose" mechanism and the fact that it works so well with 3 players. Each region will yield a majority and minority score at the end of the game, and players taking the Doge action will choose which regions score during the game. The bridges are more important than you might think, as they allow both flexibility in placing cubes and in which regions you can choose to score. There are other area-influence games I far prefer (El Grande, China, Tikal, Java), but I'd happily play this one if 2 other players insisted.

My new favorite game. I absolutely love the mechanic where you have to split the cards into different stacks and your opponent gets to choose one first and you get the other. While you can get shut out of any scoring for an annoying amount of time with unlucky card draws, it still rates a 10 for me. Was surprisingly hard to find a copy of this game these days.

RATING: 8
Another classic Alan Moon design, with Euro-style area control, and a truly novel mechanic of "one person divide the pie, the other chooses which half." In a 4-player game, two players become the "offerers", and the remaining two players become the "choosers". Each of the two offerers must decide how to divvy up cards that have good stuff (like meeple placement and scoring opportunities) and bad stuff (penalty cards that act as sort of a game clock) into two offers for their respective chooser. The choosers must decide which of the two offers to take. The tactical and strategic choices for both sides are deliciously agonizing. In the 3-player game, only one player becomes the offerer, making three offers. The remaining two players choose in turn-order which ones to take. I believe the 3-player is the most intriguing, and hence the sweet spot. I didn't know this is now OOP, but can easily understand why it commands such high prices on eBay--it's that good.

Update (08/18/2014) 4 plays: It has been about two years since our last play of this, and it is understandable: the downtime and AP is terrible. Although our group prefers the 3-player game, the decisions to split into three offers is agonizing, and equally time-consuming. The play is simple, but a lot of time is consumed in the offer portion, and this may be the reason why we don't want to bring it out too often. Also, since it is rarely played, we always need a rules refresher. We may want to aspire in playing this more often, so that the offer-making becomes more fluid. It is still a solid "8", after all these years. We just need to play it more often to get the downtime under control.

RATING: 6
An unremarkable and abstract implementation of the area majority game, one that's entirely dependent on the wisdom of the player performing the 'I cut, you choose' action that forms its central mechanism. There are people who enjoy such psychological games, I don't particularly. Some arbitrariness in the cards dealt, especially the Doge scoring cards that can massively benefit a lucky recipient. There's nothing here that isn't done better in El Grande, the poorly written rules don't help.

This is a lovely little area-control game that I am very glad I tried.  What I like to call the Gast and Goryon method of card distribution (Gast divides and Goryon chooses!) is indeed clever, unusual and cool, but there's also some very cool stuff going on with the bridges, and the traitor, and the banishment.  There are so many different ways to manipulate the board, to make scoring happen when and how you want, that this game offers real depth and a unique feel. (1 play)

A very good game.  The distributor mechanic for the action and limit cards is very different (in a good way).  Although the final game scoring is a bunch of points, there's a lot of positioning that occurs every step of the way.

It's a very good game with 4 players, but it's a "special" area-control game with only 3.  With 4, distributor / decision-maker roles will be out of balance over the course of the game - though the game is still fair and playable.

Similar scoring dynamics to El Grande, but feels just a half-a-notch below El Grande for me.  [Of course, if you only have 3 players, I'd probably pick this one.]

It was an okay game.  I really liked the splitting of the cards.  I didn't like the area majority game underneath it.

Wow, one of the biggest disappointments I've had in gaming.  If one die roll can make the far and away leader go from first to last at the end of the game...well, that's too much luck.  Toss in the incredibly random Choser vs. Divider and the random card drawing, and you are better off just rolling a die and determining the winner at the beginning.  Little to no strategy.  Didn't feel broken, but felt dumb.

initial rating 1 play 4 players 

The best Moon game I have played and looks to be his best from a Gamer's point of view from what I can see.  There is a good dose of luck here just like his other games but also a nice dose of strategy too for a change.  Although it borrows heavily from EG the card play is different enough to make it worth playing. 

Divide and choose mechanism was quite unique and brilliant really and this truly makes this title stand out in a very large crowd of AC games.  You have to try and seperate the cards in a way that you will get what you want and still give the other person what they want which is usually not easy. You also need to make the two choices somewhat equal or you could end up with the weaker pile, especially if you don't tempt them enough with what they want.  The bridge element was also pretty cool allowing you more flexibility in movement where bridges are built. 

Movement did seem too limited in the first half of the game but then became a non-issue afterwards with some nice battles for position ensuing as the board gets tighter and tighter I really did not like the way "Givers and Receivers" were chosen randomly, this was a bad decision IMO and this should be tweaked to either fully rotate or another slight variation in order to keep the roles balanced between the players.  

4 players seem fine to me albeit the turn order problem as mentioned which would improve it and maybe that's why everyone likes it with 3 but I guess I'll know once I try it with 3. Good game length of about 90 minutes, nice components, good replay, tough choices  and a fun little game.  Rating could have been 8 with turn order fixed.

Rating after 1 play - been waiting to play this for months, and when I finally got there, was a little underwhelmed TBH. Willing to accept it might need a few more plays, but the downtime while selecting cards can be excruciating - would make for a better game on SpielbyWeb! Otherwise nice, but I prefer El Grande, which this feels like a cut-down version of. Also felt like not enough bridge cards were about, but that could have easily been the shuffle. 

Lovely looking, but what's that cat doing there?!

I love the mechanic by which one person divides the cards and the other players select which piles to take.  This game shines with three players.  The four-player version takes a bit too long, as the second divider doesn't divide the piles until the first two players have finished.  I prefer El Grande as an influence game, but this plays quicker and is more enjoyable with three players.  It's a keeper.

San Marco is seen by many as the pinnacle of light-middleweight one-hour three-player area control games.  It’s a small hill to top admittedly but the game is very widely respected.  I can’t speak to its three-player awesomeness as I only played with four.  Even though the Solomon Draft-sytle card divisions provide a rich decision payoff, I can’t help feeling that modern game designs leave this title in the dust.  I look to Dominant Species as an example of an area control game done very well, and compared to that title the area control scoring is rather boring.  Obviously the games are of different weights and tailored to very different audiences, but I can imagine the more interesting scoring adapted to a shorter and lighter title.  San Marco may be a classic, and it’s not a bad design, but I don’t think it would make too much of a splash if released in 2010.

RATING: 6
Most of the mechanisms are minted from the El Grande area majority mould, but the dividing-up-the-pie (i.e. the cards in play that turn) each turn adds flavour.

Regularly being drawn first when determining the order in which the players choose their slices of pie seems quite an advantage.

I can see it's better than the slew of so-so area control games from a decade or so back and I like the combination of simple mechanisms and (at times) tough decisions, but I'm not convinced there's really a great deal here. 

One 4 player game didn't work as well as the 3 player game, mostly because the number of cards that came out that allowed you to blow away others' cubes away (I forget what they're called) meant often players has 2 or less cubes on the board, making it a crapshoot. Splitting the sets of cards amongst 2 players only didn't help either - it seemed less of a challenge, meaning the decisions were fairly obvious.

In the 4-player game having one of the players be not that great at splitting the sets up will substantially help whoever they're drawn against that turn.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Splitting mechanism is nice but decision time can drag - may need a timer with certain players.  Early points seem less important than getting more presence and bridges on the board.  Think 3 players may be better than 4.

RATING: 8
This rating is down from a 9.  After multiple plays, it seems that with 4, the luck of who gets to divide vs. when you choose can be too great a factor.  Also, we have replaced the random start position rules with a &quot;Settlers&quot; switchback placement.  It makes for a more strategically sound game from the start.
Still a high quality game, particularly for 3.  (It is ironic that the 3 player version appears to be the &quot;modified&quot; version, and yet it is superior to the &quot;original.&quot;)

For game playing in Venice... I'll take Doge over this game.  The card selection only seems to work with three players and when one player takes a large lead, it's hard for the others to catch up.

Beautiful game and components. Most interesting part is the "I split/you choose" mechanic.  My one hesitation is that apart from that interesting and agonizing decision of splitting or choosing, the subsequent area control parts (what you DO with the cards) seems too straightforward.  Seems like there's often too much of an objectively obvious point-maximizing "solution" to each card-set, with not enough choices (compare for example to the myriad of placement/action choices in [b]Hansa Teutonica[/b]); although the banisher is a slight exception.  So I might just prefer to play [b]Piece O' Cake[/b], which distills the best mechanic of this game.  Then again in my session players were tending to over-analyze other players' options while the other player was deciding, which is a pet peeve of mine; I'll withhold final judgement and see if I have the same issues in other sessions.

San Marco a 3-player area-majority game that follows in El Grande footsteps but distinguishes itself with an intriguing core mechanic. The board displays several districts in the city, and the player with the most influence in a district will occasionally score points, with a small number given to second place. The basic actions are quite simple - probably too simple. Players can add a piece to the board, places bridges across the city's canals for improved access, declare an opponent's piece a "traitor" (replacing it with your own), initiate a banishment (roll a die to remove pieces), or score a region. It's the way the actions are grouped each turn that makes San Marco a notable game.

Each turn will begin with one player revealing six action cards and four penalty cards. The player then divides these 10 into three groups, of which they will get last pick. This is called "I split, you choose." What I like about this is the freedom to create radically different options, and the need to carefully gauge your opponents' intentions. "I split, you choose" is a double-edged sword, however. Each turn of the game (usually 9-12 turn in a full game) begins with one player making really interesting decisions... alone. If you're that player, you want to make good choices, but it's easy to take a few minutes silently shaping the direction of the round. I'm sure that speeds up with experience but all of us were self-conscious about it. "Uh, sorry guys, almost done..."

Ultimately, I feel as if I enjoyed one part of San Marco. It allows players to take an engaging approach to a bland system.

There are several unusual mechanics in this game which can add to the fun or initially frustrate. You are putting down cubes to control areas and score victory points. The odd part is this is done by splitting a hand of cards between each set of two players in the four player game. You need to try to balance the hands because the other player selects the cards. There can be some imbalance in the cards between each 2 player set. Banishment cards can seem too powerful since they let you remove any cubes and it seems odd the number of cubes removed depends on a die roll. The randomized player order seems old fashioned. It is also confusing that the corners are not used on the scoring track. Bridges add a nice element to allow transfer between the districts when you place a cube. This is a fun game, but has some old fashioned design elements.

Couple games of this three handed so far, and yeah, it's a fun, tense game until the end. Nice mechanics. I really like this game, but can lead to some AP fairly easily. I do like the bits of luck as well in what is also a very "thinky" game.

The mechanics with dealing the cards and having the other choose pile is great. Apart from that this is a pretty average area control game.
I havn't tried it with 3-players, but I suspect this to be much better with 3 than 4.

The game is fun and the method of dividing the actions for choice is innovative.  The game does suffer from some instability - key places in the board can go topsy turvy too easily - often at the roll of a die.  You need to just accept the chaos and enjoy.

RATING: 7
San Marco is the poster child for all games based on the "I split, you choose"-mechanism. It's the core for a game of area majorities, a genre popular around the year 2000 but not very popular anymore with most eurogamers, probably due to its confrontational nature. The split mechanism helps in limiting conflict to a manageable extend while opening up a breadth of tactical choices at the cost of being prone to analysis paralysis. A potential drawback is the susceptibility to being decided prematurely on singular player decision granting too much of an advantage to another player. Should be played accordingly with experienced gamers to realize its potential.

My view of this game is on the way up. It offers a really nice blend of decisions and luck, along with a good, clean competitive element. The trick seems to be to make sure that some turns are spent replenishing cubes, cuz you can't afford to peter out (as I have done twice) in the last round becuase you have few to no cubes left. Nice, attract, small board, which I find appealing.

The world already had too many area control games when this was published. The only innovative part is the split-the-pie action card handing. but that's also the Achilles heel of the game: your fate depends too much on player A making his splits sufficiently well to not allow the player B to get an extra advantage over you if picking first.

The board is beautifully designed, too bad the box is so ugly.  It really seems to take at least a game to begin to understand how to distribute the cards (especially the limit points), as this is the heart of the game.  However, with the changing roles, it seems to be pretty chaotic and hard to predict or prepare for what may happen afterward.  If El Grande played well with 3, I'm not sure I would need to play San Marco again.

Traded away.

RATING: 7
My rating reflects my willingness to play this with three players, with four it would be a 4. The first time I played it was a 4-player game that lasted for 4 hours. I was victorious, but I didn't enjoy it at all. It has a similar feeling to El Grande of 9 rounds. That means a game of endless downtime. The card distribution system is a smart idea, but it just takes too much time with four players. With three players the card distribution system changed radically making the game a whole lot faster. All in all I see San Marco as an area control game positioned somewhere between Web of Power and El Grande with a lot of spice of its own added.

RATING: 7
Majority game that takes some basics from El Grande and messes with the board topology and scoring constraints. The much-lauded "I divide, you choose" mechanism is really an obvious auction alternative for leaving the balancing of the game up to the players, but well implemented for sure. Its inherent problems are that for the game to work well everyone needs to do reasonably even splits and fairly quickly to boot for the full duration of the game, or the balancing will fail, or the game will take too long, or both; this means the game is at risk from players with flagging enthusiasm as well as players with perfectionist tendencies. Additionally, the random order of choosing can be annoying (perhaps more so than the random banishments) because it often really does matter; implementing one of the suggested fixes may or may not be worth it. Most likely better with three. Bonus points for boardcat.

Played this with 3 at BGG con, and won rather handily at the end, despite being dead last for most of the game.  I think this one plays better with experienced players, as it seemed both my opponents ignored the endgame scoring, and concentrated on jumping out to the biggest leads possible in the first 2 rounds.  Admittedly, I was rather lucky at times, but I can't say that I didn't plan to do what I did, just that I didn't get wrecked by bad dice or bad cards.  The luck factor seemed to keep the game close, which makes for a more enjoyable game, imo.

This can be quite a brain-burner if people are concerned with all of the open information.  I tend to misjudge the relative values of some groups of action cards.  Scoring is very tight in the game, and leader-bashing can keep things extremely (perhaps overly?) tight through the end.

This one is tricky one: the game mechanic is awesome: I'll make card-sets and other players take one set of cards and the last one comes to me. I also like very much the graphics: board looks great and cards too.

BUT San Marco has few weaknesses: first of all, there are too much time, that you can't do anything but just waiting for your turn. On the other hand, this game requires good players, because one mistake with cards and someone gets a lot of "free" points.

Still I think, San Marco has its place and its time. I'm always ready to play this game with right players.

The epitome of tough choices in games. The separation of cards mechanic is one of the most brilliant things I have seen in a game, added to that the area control mechanic was also well done, all combine to make this a real gem of a game. Other than a few minor gripes about board design choices this was a real winner with me. After searching for this game for so long, it's nice to be rewarded with such a satisfying gaming experience for my patience. This game is pretty much the tougher little brother of El Grande, it may not have all the complexity it's more grown up sibling has, but that's okay because it brings something leaner and meaner to the table. I highly recommend this game to anyone who is at all interested in area control games, or games that require you to make difficult choices.

RATING: 8.5
Very interesting area control game in the spirit of El Grande.  I enjoy the mechanic by which a player divides a lot of cards and offers it to an opponent.  I also like the idea of mixing the beneficial cards with the detrimental cards.  I am usually not overly sensitive to randomness in games but I felt that the die roll for the banishments made those cards so hard to evaluate that it might have been better to put the banishment cards at fixed amounts (say remove 2 or 3 of your opponents' pieces).

For 3 only - my rating for 4-player a 3 or less, as I think it is fundamentally flawed with 4. In particular, I think that a combination of more time (with two splitters, the splitting phase usually takes longer) combined with a higher luck factor - not so much between players as between <i>pairs</i> of players (if one pair gets great cards with low limits, and the other gets  chumpy cards with high limits, the first pair of players has a significant advantage).

An okay 3 player game, my issue with this game is similar to my issues with El Grande and other games with variable cards that the players select from.  It is all too common to have a weird selection of cards to divide, which can unbalance the game.

Not enough control is allowed to be a game of skill. You never know when and how many Doge will come out, so planning is impossible. Range of effect result of a dice roll is just too far wide. It can almost kick a player, or it can affect almost nothing.

But it has too long downtime to be a game of luck.

Only wonderful board and cards are attractive.

I consider this heavier than most, because the difficulty increases for everyone as someone actually puts thought into hand splitting and starts to count. With experienced players, this can get quite a brain burning experience. Two plays not reccomended in a row unless you can handle pressure.

Awesome game! I really enjoyed playing this with 3. I heard it was perfect at that player count and I was not disappointed. The game is fairly light in terms of rules complexity, but the decisions are grueling. It's also got healthy dose of randomness with die rolling. The components are nice, the insert is a plus and the play time is reasonable. All in all, a really great game!

RATING: 5
There are definately some clever mechanisms in this game.  However, the main mechanic (I split, you choose) gets tedious after a while even though it does produce some tough decisions.  The downtime while waiting for the distributors to create the piles is just unbearable no matter how fast players try to be, and the potential for over-analysis seems to be quite high.  If the game clocked in at closer to an hour, I would be tempted to bring it out now and then, but at >90 minutes, there are a million other games I'd rather play.

Great area control game. 
Enjoy it more each time it is played.
Easy enough to introduce to new gamers.
Challenging enough for the game group.
UPDATE:
No doubt about it... a solid 9.25.
The best area control game for 3 ever created. Right up there with Union Pacific as my favorite Moon design.
Only play with 3 as it is perfect with that number.
Might eventually make it to a "10"
Stay tuned.

A brutal short term tactical game. You don't have much ability to defend your position or make long term plans. You basically have to maximize each turn and not worry too much about the next. There's some enjoyment in the I split you choose mechanism but not enough to elevate the game above average in my mind.

Initial rating after 2 games with 3.
Nice Eurogame. Quite interactive, keeps you thinking during potential downtime. Will probably play pretty fast with experienced players.

The "fresh factor" that sets this one apart from other area control euro's: Starting player divides the cards into various portions of which he/she gets the last choice... Nice tension.

Update: after 2 more plays: this game is ideal with 3 players who like screwage with a tiny amount of brainwork. Love it.

NL: ideaal voor 3-spelers. Lastige keuzes, tactisch spelen.

Very solid game. I love the split and choose mechanism. Creates much angst (some downtime too, but it is good to watch the agonizing decisions).

Picked up in Essen ´06 upon suggestion of my wife. Surprisingly good game, given it is from Moon who I normally do not care much for.  Did not like the random nature of choosing the order of picking the cards, but the card divisions were tense and exciting.  Lots of good decisions, and nail-biting.  Played quickly (our 3-player game took ~45 minutes) and my wife interested in a copy.  Will look into the 2-player varients and see if they are any good.  Looks pretty nice as well, good art on the cards and board.

Once learned, really easy and fun to play. Got a bit slow, since we were all taking our time when making distributor choices, choosing cards, and then how to play each hand. That might be cured with an egg timer. Was amazed at how quickly a lead could be destroyed and taken over. Made for a suspenseful end game.

RATING: 7.4
Gorgeous board and cards, nice game. The problem, based on only one play, is that everything is decided in the last day. Whoever is the leader is screwed, so you better not catch the attention of the other players. Still, some interesting decisions about what cards to give to the other players, some "diplomacy" involved. A little bit too long, and can lead to some AP. But, for a light area control (faster), I prefer China.

We played this with four players and I was very disappointed- I found it to be very random and pretty lacking in strategy.  One of the big problems was the imbalance between the two sets of cards; perhaps with three players it would be more fun since there is only one set of cards.  I'm not sure that it will get tried with three in our group, though, as we have so many other options.  I really wanted to like this, but I'll probably end up trading it away.

I love area control games.  This is almost a compete 180 twist to El Grande.  Much harder to keep your followers in certian areas and they can get wiped out very easy.  Like the card splitting aspect of this game, that's what makes it unique.  
Very brilliant, vivid board with awsome colors.  Very eye appealing.  Great storage system as well.


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A great little area majority game. Certainly could be called an El Grande "lite" type of game. It's not really a groundbreaking game in any way but it does deliver a fair bit of difficult decision making every time you need to decide how to split up the cards as you know you'll be choosing last. The game actually moves along very quickly as there are only 3 "sessions" which don't take long at all to complete. The only thing that slows down play a bit is the dividing of cards which can sometimes take a bit of time when the regions are all closely contested. I've found that the bridges in the game aren't overly useful but maybe the full strategy of using them for the biggest benefit is still escaping us as we haven't played the game much as of yet. Definitely a game to try again and especially since I lost my first game rather badly. I need to play more to see if I can come up with better strategy/tactics next time. The game rules are very easy to figure out and certainly this is not anything near a heavyweight game... much more middle weight or even on the light side. Overall a good light game that's easy to teach and that has enough meatiness in the gameplay to make replays  interesting.

Area control game but the novel aspect  of game is that one splits cards for your opponent to choose. Cards let you score, put tokens on the board, etc, but come with penalty points. Like any other area control game, perception plays a role in the outcome. This game is decent, and there is uncertainty since the purging of an area involves rolling a die.

One of the very best games... especially with 3 players, this area control game uses an ingenious action-dividing mechanism to ensure that tough choices abound. The small number of possible actions allow for a huge number of strategic possibilities, exacerbated by the fact that majorities are often won by one or two cubes and the fact that ties are particularly punishing for those in 2nd place. Shamefully, this is well out of print at this point, but it's one of those grail games that justifies the quest.

I played this well after playing Rialto, but the surface similarities are such that I'm surprised there wasn't some sort of development note in the latter acknowledging a debt of inspiration. San Marco was described to me as area majorities with a Piece o' Cake mechanism, which it totally is. It plays light with little downtime, but is marred by the fact that the person whose turn follows the weakest divider will win. It is also the ultimate king-making game (as a corollary). The divider-as-kingmaker effect is more pronounced in San Marco than Piece o' Cake, since, as a civilized board gamer, you play the former with 3 and the latter with 5, and you divide up more things in the former.

Funny area control game. Very mean. The decisions (distribution of the cards) are very deep, but at the end, your result is more the product of your rivals actions than consequence of your own actions.

It's definitly a game for three players.

It's also faster than announced.

When played by 3 expert players, the general experience is much better.

This game has some wonderful ideas which makes for a really  interesting area influence game. I really love the mechanic where you pick cards for the other players. Having to balance placement and the potential to score is fantastic. The first to 10 mechanism to decide the end of the round (and the bonuses/penalties that come with it) is genius. And it all looks so beautiful. However, my major concern is that this game can really grind to crawl as players try to work out the repercussions of every decision.

Takes a bit to "grow" on you.  Is much better as a 3 player game then 4.  Also can be played as a 2 player game (though had to make up rules for that).  Still has yet to grow on me.  Either I'm missing something in the rules or this game is just missing that "something" that makes me want to play it again and again.  This one sits on the shelf most of the time.

I have only played this one with 4 players ... I am not very good at the game, but it was full of difficult decisions and very interesting "combinations" ... Though I must admit, I did not care much for the "random" selection of who divided the cards and who got to choose from the divided card stacks. I hear that the game plays much better with 3 players.

Similarities to El Grande. Best for 3 players. Needs some house rules IMO, concerning turn order, bridge limits and the banishment action.

For a 'balanced' thinking game, this only works as a 3 player game for us, and even then, I find the division mechanic too hard to enjoy or execute well. After each turn, it seemed a lot clearer what *should* have been done. But to think it all through adequately makes the downtime insane so the game seems to become one of "should haves" which turns it into a non-caring, see what happens type of event. Playing 4 player doesn't necessarily make it faster - the choice is almost as hard - and just makes it more unbalanced. Low limit cards and banishments, transfers and scores in one hand, for example, high limits and placement cards in the other. An interesting construction that I can appreciate occasionally, but it doesn't bring me a lot of joy.

Based on one play: An area majority game that is very simple to play. Each turn one player gets a collection of cards that he must split up into sets equal to the number of players. These cards have actions and penalties and are selected by the other players and then he gets the last set. You are trying to get majority and minimizing your penalty cards. Simple rules and a nice intro to area majority.

RATING: 8
This area control game has a mechanic that I've not seen in other games--one player takes a pile of good and bad cards and divides them into two piles, and an opponent takes the one of his choice, leaving the first player with the other pile.  This gives the players cards with which they add and remove cubes from the board.  Majorities can change pretty quickly, which is cool.  A lot of neat things going on here, though admittedly there is a lot of "take-that" cards.  Despite the obvious gimmick, I thought this was a very interesting game.

San Marco is a majorities game, and I don't really like those. However, it implements pie division ("I divide, you choose") in a clever way. You have to play this with people of similar level though, as the values of the different cards are not easy to estimate.

Just two solo plays so far.  Rules aren't complicated, and it looks like it would be interesting to play.  Themes are important to me and this has just barely enough -- it's an area control (whoever puts more meeples in an area gets more points) game with an extremely loose backdrop of Venice, but it really is an abstract, although the little plastic canal bridges are cute and very attractive board.

遊戲共三輪，每輪數回合，每回合玩家會輪流當分牌墩的人，分完了之後輪流選，but負責分的人最後選!!!!!!! 牌有兩種：行動牌、點數牌。當有玩家收集的點數牌數字大於等於10那他這輪就沒辦法再做事，而遊戲主要的目的是在圖板上六個取得家族人數數量上的優勢來賺分數，而行動牌就是讓玩家可以放自己的族人、踢走別人的族人、互換別人的族人、蓋橋樑讓族人可以跨到別區等方式較勁。遊戲當中有可能利用行動牌先計算某區分數，遊戲結束時會有一次全部六區總計分。

The essence of balanced area control.  I find it has more downtime than El Grande in the card distributions, but far less in selection and resolution.  It is similar to El Grande in that you need to have nicely spread out influence to win, but it happens in a much different way.  I really like how the cards have different impacts at different points in the game for different players.  Tons of decisions.  Also, a good mix of plan for present vs. future.  As an additional bonus, it's very very easy to explain (though the card distributions take some practice). Pretty much everything I enjoy in a game.

I found San Marco to be engaging yet simple, with a playing time that's acceptable for repeat plays.  It's an interesting area of control game with the 'I split, you pick' card mechanism that can both ruin and save you.  It is also important to read the rules carefully where cards are concerned - otherwise you are likely to come across dreadful balancing issues. After more plays, I still enjoy it yet it won't be the most reached-for title. I like that it's fast and fairly simply to grasp, but it's kinda dry and will destroy your AP-prone friends. El Grande would be a likely replacement, if it weren't for the shortened game length.

Really pretty game with an unusual "I cut, you choose" mechanism.  I really like the game, but it does suffer horribly from analysis paralysis - more so that playing other similar depth of game with the same people.  As long as you're not in a hurry, or are able/willing to play quickly and sub-optimally, then it's a very good game.

Oh, and as mentioned in almost all reviews, play it with three people, not four.  With four it loses its balance in a couple of different ways.  With three, it's a great game.

[floatleft][ImageID=308542][/floatleft]San Marco (SM) is the perfect 3 player game and really should only be played as a 3 player game. What makes San Marco stand out beyond any other game is the card drafting mechanism. In SM the active player assigns the available draft but they are the last person to choose so they must assign card groupings strategically. San Marco fills a collection niche like none other.

RATING: 6
This is an interesting area control game that's really built for only 4 players. It has a three player mode, but there is a phase where half the players create piles of action cards that are available for other players to take. When you do 4 player, two players make two piles, but when you do 3 player, one player makes three piles, which can cause the game to drag.

The components are great, and the gameplay is good. Many aspects of this game were re-appropriated for Feld's Rialto. They are reasonably different games however, so I wouldn't avoid this one if you already have an opinion of Rialto.

What is it keeping this game from being great? Really, the downtime between turns is killer. Everyone sort of gets their turn being the one to create the action card piles, so if you have a player prone to analysis paralysis, it can be really killer. Other than that, the game is really fun.

Suffers from a huge analysis paralysis problem, as every single turn, someone spends a long time carefully dividing the cards, then the rest probably spend a long time deciding which group to take.  It's an interesting game mechanic, but really slows down the game.  The 'limit card' (penalty point) system to bring about the end of a round is another interesting mechanic, but I disliked the effect it had, since the game seemed too short.  I also didn't like the huge variability in value of the 'banish' cards -- roll a 1, it's almost worthless, roll a 6, it can destroy an opponent's previously solid position, that's way too much difference in effect from the same card.  Well, all criticisms aside, I LIKED the game, it seemed to have a decent amount of strategy and tactics, and I wouldn't mind playing it again.

I want to love this game.  It has a great card distribution mechanism, area majority, and strong flavors of El Grande.  It has intense decisions and fierce competition with three players.  However, it suffers from severe randomness, king making (typical 3 player dynamic), and lack of late-game control.  If the card distribution mechanism could be adapted to a 5 player variant with the same decisions and balance as the 3 player game, this would be awesome.  Alas, while this is a better three player game than El Grande, it's painfully flawed.  And yet, it's a very enjoyable and fascinating game that I'll come back to playing time and time again.

I REALLY like the division mechanism in this game, and I feel with each play I'm getting a slightly better handle on what things are worth - of course, the mechanism is tied closely to  board position.  Great fun and definitely my suggestion any time we have three players.  Some complain about the wildly fluctuating value of the banishments - they can be REALLY powerful or a dud depending on the dice role.  That aspect doesn't bother me at all, but that said, I don't mind a heavy dose of luck in a game that I'm playing.

San Marco is an area majority scoring game. The core mechanism is drawing cards for you and your opponent(s), then building two (or three) hands out of those cards; your opponent chooses first and you get what's left. The major drawback is the dice roll determining how many cubes are banished from an area.

RATING: 7
Exceptional board art and a nice theme. Action cards for each turn are divided up by one player but then are selected by his opponents with the divider getting the leftover actions. This makes for some tough decisions for the divider as a poor choice while balancing the action cards can be devastating. This also results in some downtime for the other players while the divider ponders the multiple combinations of actions. I would not turn down future games but it won't make my buy list.

Played this once, many Moons (ha!) ago, at the proclaimed "ideal" player count (3). I could recall that it was rather swingy, and also that I planned poorly. This split-and-choose mechanism certainly presented some tough choices, and I regret that I have not played it more, because it could certainly play out differently every time. There is room for strategy here, I just have yet to experience it in full. What I did feel was an area control game done RIGHT. Simple in execution, yet rife with meaningful decision, and in-your-face player interaction.

(+) I-split-you-choose done right. Very tough decisions at times.
(+) Extremely elegant rules which allow for strategic maneuvers. 
(+) Absolutely beautiful production.

(-) Turns can be very swingy--which may be good for those behind but can turn sour for the leader.
(-) There are times where you are stuck with poor choices from the splitting, which is inevitable.
(-) Really does not play well at 2, and does not play so well with 4. A strange nebulously perfect three player game.

The bit with the player who gets to choose the cards to divide is brilliant - you know quickly if you've done a good job by how difficult a choice the other player has in deciding what to pick.  I can see some expansions making it even more interesting, but it is an excellent game as-is.

RATING: 6
Good use of the I split/you choose mechanism, but this will lead to a bit of a learning curve as new players learn the power of various cards in order to make better card splits.  An excellent game with 3 players as one player splits and the other two chose.  This forces the splitter to consider not only what to give the other 2 players, but what might be left at the end.  A bit more complex than a split between 2 people that adds the right amoung to angst to the split decision.

Rating is down a little bit as luck still plays a large role in the game, especially with the banishment card where 1 to 6 (based on die roll) are removed from a territory.

Too much to process, too much down-time, rather too much luck. Nevertheless there are some positives (including the design) which mean that it gets a reasonable rating.

RATING: 4
This game has a fatal flaw.

Splitting the cards is a genuinely difficult task--maybe toughest task in Eurogaming.  But the winner of the game is the player who benefits from the "mistakes"  (and frankly calling errors in splitting "mistakes" is unfair--it's so difficult.)

When the a game presents difficult challenges, but doesn't reward victory to the player who performed them the best, that's unacceptable!

I can recognize that the mechanisms are cool, but I'm always left feeling that the special actions are too huge (banishment, in particular) and make it feel a little chaotic for my tastes.  After more playings, I definitely can recognize some cool things about the game, but I don't find it fun.  Divvying up the cards intelligently would take me longer than I feel comfortable making the other players wait.  Ends up feeling like work, only to have wild swings from the banishment, etc. topple your position.  Meh.

First played 2007-04-09.  Vaguely reminds me of Web of Power.  Gorgeous map. The core cardplay mechanism of splitting into groups which other players pick from is cool and makes for some very interesting tough decisions.  Annoying misdesign on corners of score track.  The expel action seems too wildly random compared to all the other actions, which are completely deterministic, but I still like the game.

Simple and interesting area control game.

+ I really like the "I split you chose" mechanism which leads to really interesting decisions.
+ Even when you are not splitting, you are interested in what is done and a bit tense when you see the final offers being slowly built. Especially when you see a good offer that perfectly suit your hidden plan and then he changed it at the last second.
+ The table talk to infulence the distributor is also something I enjoy.
+ Easy to teach. With new players, I highly recommend to explain the interest of each cards with some examples to reduce the risk of balance issue.
+ Reasonable play time (60 to 90 min)
- Can be unbalanced if one of the player is not able or does not make the effort to make at least a decent split. I have not experienced it but I can easily see it happens.
- King making can occurs easily. Again, I have not experienced it but I can easily see it happens.
- Mainly a 3 players game (cf. my comment below on player count)

I always played it with 3.
I would not recommend to play it with 4 players using the official rules. But using the open drafting variant it can lead to some other interesting choices: each of the two distributers take a card on after the other until each of them as the right number of the two different types of card. But this would however increase the impact of uneven players skills and could lead to some poor round for the selector without any way for him  to mitigate it.

A fairly unused mechanism of 'you cut, I choose' which makes for very interesting choices rendered insignificant in the face of pure randomness with which areas for scoring are selected.

A majority game set in Venice, probably one the best of its kind.  Players score points for having the most aristocrats in each district.  Quick, easy, and deep enough.  The main attraction of this game is the "split the cake" mechanic:  One player divides the cards and his/her rivals pick first.  The other attraction is the bridges, that modifies adjacent territories.  Both of this mechanics make this game unique, and give a lot to think of.

So don't play it that way. Roll with the punches and leave the final tabulation to the end. The current rating is provisional; I can't predict how I'll feel after more plays of this game.

RATING: 6
A majority game fueled with the pie rule. Not as good as expected, since the game flow is haphazard (the limit cards and uneven downtime when the divider is choosing how to allocate cards), the scoring is all over the place, bridges seem weak and Banishment adds a huge, incongruent dose of friction to a game that otherwise smoothly embodies only reactive luck.

Think this game will be better if it added more asymmetry between the players so you can steal some deals as the divider. I thought the bridges would do it in terms of limiting each players' options, but they needed to be stronger. Transfer/Banishment are always useful no matter your position, and even the District cards are almost always useful.

Also, a single bad pie cut and you've taken yourself out of the game, and have probably given the game to the next player.

Still, very interesting and unique, and one of the best area-majority options for 3.

I think Banishment can be reined in by house-ruling the die roll to only give results of 1, 2 or 3 cubes. Doesn't affect game balance since the players determine game balance anyway. But I am judging the game by its printed rules.

3+3

I'm not sure that is the case -- perhaps it is just poor card division.  As I said, the jury is still out.

San Marco -- Played once; three-player.  Tough decisions, but we resisted agonizing over them and the game moved along quickly enough.  For me, that's the way to play.  Yes, I might have ranked better if I had spent more time choosing how to divide the cards or deciding which set of cards to take, but the game wouldn't have been as fun.  

The map is kind of a stylized decoupage.  Often the artist must choose between form and function (art which is pleasing/appropriate or art which conforms to the strictures of gameplay).  For example, if gameplay requires regions to be colored, the map ceases to look like anything but a children's game.  In this case, the art is both pleasing and useful.  Regional colors are easy to recognize, yet instead of feeling artificial, they bring a sophisticated sense of fun.

RATING: 8
A tricksy game of area control and cake-cutting puzzles. As with all games featuring the cake-cutting mechanism, the usual caveat applies: players must be roughly of the same experience level, and a little downtime must be tolerated.

What I really like about San Marco is the inclusion of limit cards, which allow for some creative divvying as they can be paired up with strong combinations of actions. And while I enjoy the means more than the end to this game, the area control element is admittedly tied in very well. All players' intentions are easily seen on the central board, and the randomness associated with the banishment action ensures there is no optimum solution to every puzzle.

It is worth noting that all my games so far have been 3P games; I should give this a whirl with 4P at least once to see if it's just as good. The components are also great for an older production, ranging from the painterly illustrations to the teensy plastic bridges. It's just a shame the box cover looks like a horrific Photoshop hack-job.

After I played Settlers (my personal gateway game) a pal brought El Grande and we played that for many a year. I still rate it highly; and this is a slightly simpler, shorter (AP-depending) similar game in terms of scoring and placement, but rather than bidding for cards you're either selecting them or offering them to opponents - and trying to make sure they don't take the cards you want. Very nice game and very pretty too.

Nice card division mechanism, sure to be stolen for more games down the line. Light game that is fun but the Banishing cards are too random.

I don't mind if they are powerful (which they are), I just don't like them being so random and variable. This takes the edge off nicely, I think.

Nagyon régóta vágytam már a kipróbálásra, mert rettentő jókat olvastam és halottam róla. Sokan jobban tartják, mint a nagy öreg El Grandét és azt kell mondjam nem erősek ezek a jelzők. Tényleg jobb. Nagyon nagy élmény volt. Alapvetően a Grandéhoz hasonló területi többséges játék, a zsenialitása a akciók elosztásában található. Minden körben más játékos dönt arról, hogy a random húzott akciókártyákat hogyan osztja szét a játékosok számának megfelelő paklikba, amiből véletlenszerű sorrendben választanak a játékosok, majd utoljára szétosztó. Rendkívül jó mechanizmus, ahogy az is, hogy akciókártyákon kívül limitkáryákat is szét kell osztani ezekkel, amik eléréskor véget ér egy nagy kör, amiből három van a játékban. A játék alapvetően gyorsabb, mint az előd, érdekesebb is véleményem szerint. Rendkívül konfliktusos, de ez mégsem zavart, mert rendkívül dinamikus is, ami nekem egyértelműen a Dominant Species állandó változó tábláját juttatta eszembe. És ami nálam óriási plusz, hogy tipikusan hármas játék, amiből nagyon kevés van. Hirtelen nem is tudok negatívumot mondani a játékra. Nagyon erős 8-as. Későbbi játékok során akár még nőhet is pontszám.

[2014-09-13]
Sajnos mégis van negatívum. Egyrészt, hogy négyen nagyon nem olyan, mint hárman. A szerencse szerepe meghatványozódik négyjátékosnál. Egyrészt nagyon nem mindegy hogyan jön ki, hogy ki oszt kinek. Ha mindig hasonló párok jönnek létre simán egymást erősíthetik. Nagyon nem mindegy ilyenkor a kártyák elosztása se. Egyik párnál 4 pontozó kártya, másiknál egy se már a játék elején eldöntheti a végeredményt. Négyen egy kezdő, gyengébb játékos is rettentő királycsináló lehet. Szóval azt kell mondanom ezt a játékot csak hárman szabad játszani. 8->7

If you take this game too seriously, you can have a great time.  It should be treated as a light random game where you quickly try to make the best of what you are given.  Sure this certainly tips it's hat to El Grande, but that is the trend for the early naughts. If you want an El Grande fix but only have three players this is the better alternative.  

My only real problem with this game is that it only works best with people that want to play this from the hip.  If you try to make this a heavier game than it is you will be in trouble.  If people are spending more than a minute figuring out how cards get divided, it bogs in tedium.  This can be a very frustrating game if you are a min/maxer, as there seems that there should be a perfect answer to the distribution.  Those of us that don't take forever on their turns feel like we are dying a slow death.  Play from the gut when dividing, I recommend playing with all the cards face up when trying to decide, the game will speed up tremendously.

Area majority game with a beautiful presentation (c'mon, who doesn't like the cool bridges?) and the notorious deck splitting mechanic.  Great 1h game that shines with 3.

RATING: 10
A wonderful area-control game.  I might have to move this one up to a 9.  The decisions in this one are truly delicious - either you are trying to split the hands that your opponent gets to choose, or you have to try to pick from the hands your opponent has made.  I'd like to get this to table more often.

UPDATE: Upon further review, moving this one up to a 9, as it just really is that much fun to play.

UPDATE #2: This is now one of my favorite games - the perfect blend of many great mechanics.

UPDATE #3: Considering that I've been written up as Fanboy when playing this, I have to move this to a 10.  What a great game!

El Grande is the king of old school area majority games, but El Grande doesn't work with fewer than four players. San Marco is best with three. So it has a niche. The "I cut, you choose" mechanic creates some interesting decisions and allows the cutter to play his opponents off against each other. That's exactly what I like about 3p games. San Marco is a good one.

RATING: 6.5
Area control game with a twist: 1 person divides, then the others choose first. It's a good game, actually, but the splitting takes some time and I find it kinda stressful and difficult. Also, it seems that everyone really needs to know what they're doing to make the splits appropriate. Probably a bit too streamlined for my tastes.

--- Summary (3er) ---
Initial setup: place cubes in 2 random locations, then go around twice placing bridges between islands (2/player). 

Each round, the splitter gets 6 action cards and 4 limit cards (numbered 1-3). Splitter divides these into 3 groups. In random order, other 2 players each choose a group (and uses all cards); Splitter gets remaining group. Limit cards are saved, others discarded. Once a player has 10+ limit, they're done for the phase (others get 1 more turn, with 5/3 action/limit cards divided up, before phase ends -- game ends after 3rd phase). 

At end of each phase, player with lowest limit gets a free banish, and also scores VP equal to difference between highest and lowest limit sums. At end of game, every region is scored; most VP wins!

The actions allow you to place a cube in a region (or a neighbor connected by your bridge), change another cube to yours, place a bridge, score a region (first may move the Doge token, which starts off the board, to any location connected to current location by bridge(s); then 1st/2nd place players score VP), or banish (pick a region, roll d6, remove that many cubes).

RATING: 8.5
This simple yet very entertaining game has a lot of strategy, some luck, and only lasts about an hour or so.  My favorite part is, during each phase only one  player selects the hands to be played by all.  Brilliant!

El Grande is on of my favorites, so I was excited to finally give this one a try.  I like the mechanism of dividing and choosing too, but for some reason it just didn&#039;t grab me.  It feels claustropobic.  Maybe I had too high of expectations.

Played once.  Very interesting area control game.  Dividing up the roles is great fun and where you truly get ahead.  Choosing is almost as important if the divider did his job correctly.  I had a blast with this game, and I can't wait to try it some more.  All the game mechanics seem to flow smoothly together, making for an area control experience somewhere in between Web of Power and El Grande.  Perfect for 3.  Like San Juan/Puerto Rico, I would choose San Marco with 3, El Grande with 4/5.  Has potentially the kingmaker problems of most area-control games, so it might not be wise to get out to an early lead...unless you do what I did and cajole the other player into not giving the other guy the game just because I got out to an early lead.  Of course, that ends up not being very fun to certain kinds of gamers...

RATING: 6.5
[Ravensburger 2001 edition] {Medieval; I-choose-you-pick, area-majority, variable-player-order, dice-rolling; optimal 3p} I am not a fan of area-majority game. Thus, I have only a few area-majority games. However, San Marco interests me for its unique mechanic: "I-choose-you-pick". It really shines.

San Marco is not an easy game for general players because it's very difficult to split the cards into a good set. I witness many players are paralyzed and can't figure what to do which the set of cards. San Marco is unforgiving and requires concentration of every player. Don't get it out if you want to relax your brain. Players need to foresee how others plan and act. Because there are multiple paths of scoring, players need to calculate which path they should pursuit. San Marco is dynamic enough that there is no sure winner; however, the leader will surely be vulnerable to bashing.

I find the rule of moving Doge strange. It seems to facilitate the running-leader problem.

Rating is based on three 3-player games. This is a solid area influence game.

The split-the-cards mechanic is interesting, but a bit tedious. I wonder if over time we'll get faster at it increasing my enjoyment of the game, or grow so sick of splitting up the cards over and over again that I'll trade it away. Only repeat plays will tell.

San Marco is a good three player game where you have to setup three choices of actions for others to choose the actions to have area control and gain experience points.  The game is beautiful and works very well but the theme is lightly laid on to a masterful blend of mechanics.  I will happily play someone's else's copy but my extensive collection does not need this title.

Based on one 4 player game. I want to play it with 3 and boy, does it seems like there is a lot there. What a great game. The card split mechanic is great and is used for great effect too. Tense, filled with interaction. Don't play with the wrong people though, there is quite a bit of take that involved. Like most 3 player games which this is best with, San Marco has a slight kingmaker problem. Our group never really struggles with this, we simply play to best improve our score. This really keeps the metagame clean and less filled with nastyness.

Card-driven area control game set in Venice. The game's main feature is in the card distribution phase, where a player divides the cards into piles and is then the last to select their cards from these. This is a particularly thought-provoking aspect of the game as the player doesn't want their opponents to gain too much of an advantage from having better cards and also wants to have decent cards left to select for themselves. These cards are then used to place cubes (aristocrats) into different areas of Venice, build bridges over which the aristocrats can cross into other areas, and to score the areas depending on who has the highest and second highest number of aristocrats there. 'San Marco' is both light-hearted and strategic to play, which sadly is an all too rare quality in the world of games.

Nice, tight design. Reminds me a bit of El Grande: it has area control and you are constantly trying to make the most of the situation at hand. 

Scoring is what matters, but if you ignore map presence too long you find yourself running out of options. The true genius of this game is not these scoring mechanics but the 'I cut you choose' mechanic. 

This allows a savy player to make the most of the current situation on the map, delivering you worse and worse options each time. Brilliant in its simplicity.

Two main drawbacks: 
1. It is a 'silent' game. As in, if you talk about strategy or the game you ruin the experience in multiplayer (and the game needs 3 to shine). And the temptation to 'influence' the decision making is a hard one to avoid.
2. Draw factor about who has first choice, coupled with the randomness of appearance of Doge cards in your own turn can hugely influence a game, even topping strategy.

But all in all, great gem.

Not too sure about this one.  Fortunately we bought it from Germany paid very little for it, since it's only really been played by the two of us with dummy players and the one game with others was a disaster.  Much as we like the idea of the game, it doesn't get played much and due to the fiddly nature of sorting the cards.  We thought it would play best with three, but unfortunately that's a number we rarely have.  However, we have had one really good three player game with it, so in the right circumstances...

There are a few problems with San Marco, that stop it from being a real top scorer for me.  Whilst I appreciate the unique card splitting mechanic, it seems that it takes up most of the game time, so 2 people are out of it for a while.  When the cards are chosen, the actions take place at a rapid rate.  The Banish card is too random, and can completely devastate a player with one roll, but have no effect with another.  Bridges are essential for success, but can appear infrequently.  And this is the heart of San Marco's problem - its just too random. Because the action cards are reshuffled into the deck at the end of each passage, there can often be a very unbalanced distribution of cards.  I'm also not sure I like the random draw for Distributor and Decision maker. Could have been great, but give me El Grande any day!

Two kids, one piece of chocolate cake. How do you prevent a squabble? One kid cuts the piece in two and the other chooses their piece first. Innovative game mechanics and beautiful components all add up to one of the best games out there. My rating would drop sharply for four players, since the two separate sets of card draws become unbalancing and the game tends to drag a bit as the two separate drafting rounds are played out. As a three-player game where all three are selecting from the same group of cards, this absolutely shines. In fact, this currently ranks as my favorite three-player game and has a place in my overall Top 10 list.

San Marco is your best bet if you want El Grande for three.  Indeed, the cut-the-cake mechanism is ingenious, but there's nearly too much for distributors to analyze and nothing for decision-makers to do until they see their choices.  That equates to a lot of down time.  With a bit of patience, however, San Marco has exuberant twists of fortune.

One of my very favorites.

I love the I-cut-you-choose mechanic and I am very surprised it is not in more games.

Update:  I have played this 15-20 times and have only won once.  Still it is one of my all-time favorites.  I just love I-cut-you-choose, but if there is one drawback is the game can bog down with the wrong players.  Even then, I enjoy my time with this game.

Update: Still a 10 and still a favorite. This plays surprisingly well with the 2-player variant. I would recommend it.

I think I understand the relative scarcity of the I-cut-you-choose mechanic. It can make for a very large decision tree with even a small number of variables. This in turn can cause a perfect information game to grind to a halt with the analytical types.

But what if one used the mechanic in a game that had more hidden information? Would the lack of information be frustrating? I think it could make for a light, shoot-from-the-hip kind of game. Bruno Faidutti could probably do this well.




Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 1
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 1
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 3
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 3


Overall - 1

The divide-and-choose method of splitting cards creates a tension that is one of my favorite gaming experiences.  The area control element and card powers are icing on the cake.  The use of a six-sided die to determine banishments yields too wide of a range of power - I think it would play better with an averaging die.

I like the mechanics of this game but lack the patience to play.  Dividing up the cards often takes the divider a very long time, and unfortunately there is no strategy to plan in the meantime since the card hand will often completely change the board.

RATING: 8.5
A really good area majority game. It has a mechanic that I haven't seen before: one player that a certain amount of action cards (good) and limit cards (bad), and with them is necessary to form 1 or 2 (in a three player game) stacks of cards. Then the other player (or players, with three players) choose one stack, the one that was left is yours. This prevents you from making an all bad stack, but also makes you choose cards to form a good enough stack for you (but not too good, as to the other player take). Simple and ingenious.

I also liked the artwork in the cards and the board. To bad that this game isn't in print anymore. A shame. If you have the chance, go for it. San Marco is a fast and fun game with a good deal of "take that" elements, so be warned about this.

A match takes about 40 to 60 minutes, but leaning more for the 40 minutes. The game can be teached in less than 10 minutes.

With players who know what they are doing this is great.

We manage to keep each other in check with the piles for the whole game.  It turns into a game about playing for the final scoring.  You must posture for the rest of the game.  

It's ambiguous!  It's hard to see all the tactics!  The "I divide, you choose" mechanic is so smart in that it gives you control

But with control comes responsibility... don't mess it up or the whole game will crash and it will be your fault!  you have handed them the victory.

Played with much table talk about the possibilities of the cards.

*something changed our last game.  it was faster and everything came down to posturing for the final scoring.  the decisions became easier and scores were almost dead even (within 3 points) until the final scoring.  I'm not sure if it's groupthink or if the game becomes nothing or if the game becomes setting up incremental positional edges for the final scoring.  Either way I was dissapointed in our last bout and reduced it to a 7.

*it becomes rote after a while.  disappointing given how good the base mechanic is.  sold.

Nice components, and offering card sets to the other players is an original concept. However, whenever I am in the mood to play this I am also in the mood for El Grande. And then San Marco does feel like a poor substitute.

Trade interest: lowI would like to rank this game a little higher but many elements in this game can be found in El Grande and the latter is much better. Banishment cards are brutal and can effectively eliminate players from the game. However, the card division method is unique and warrants a mention. Good game overall, but El Grande is tops.

Good!  I had heard this called El Grande Light, which had me worried since I am not that crazy about El Grande.  Its no more related to El Grande than China is and it's a hell of alot more interesting than Either one.  The best part of the game is how the starting player gets to distribute the cards into piles, but is last to pick.  I had heard of this mechanism before, but this is my first time playing it.  I must say that it works very well and makes the game.  The one strike against the game is that the rules are not very clear.  It might be too randomn for some, but that isn't a problem for me.

One player has to make a really hard decision dividing the cards up before everyone takes some.  Then the next player does it.  I don't care for it and the game is easily thrown off by having at least one player who can't divide the cards up wisely.

Very interesting area control game. I love El Grande and this scratches the same itch but with perhaps simpler rules. The "Fact or Fiction"/"You split I choose" aspect to the game makes it quite tense. Splitting those piles well is really hard!

Of course, there is a king-maker problem. If one person sets up the piles poorly, they can hand someone else a large advantage. Allowing kibitzing from other players to help the splitter might help.

I like this much better than El Grande. Maybe it is the card thing and having to divvy up the choices. Maybe it is a Moon thing. Who knows, right? Well I think it is in the same ball-park as El Grande (a game that I don't like at all) but it is more enjoyable because it less a lot less agressive.

RATING: 8
The splitting of the cards into 2 piles and then having the other player choose (i.e. I split, you choose) dynamic is interesting.  Subtle game choices to be made in areas, bridges, scoring, etc.  The extra card spliting round (if you qaulify) can be very beneficial.

What an agonizing mechanic the divide and choose is. I agree it plays a little smoother with three, but it's still fine with 4. People have been saying it's El Grande lite... I'm not sure I agree at all. There can be just as much anaylsis paralysis. The only downside to the game is waiting around for the divider to split up the cards.

Some call it El Grande for 3 players. I actually like this more than El Grande as I just love the "I split, you choose" mechanic. One of the games where it is most enjoyable to watch another player take her turn. Really, Alan Moon's best design.

# Meilleur : 3
# Recommandé :
# Non-recommandé : 4
# Non-essayé :
4 joueurs : bien que le livret de règlement le présente tout d'abord comme un jeu pour 4 joueurs, avec une adaptation pour 3, je crois qu'il s'agit plutôt du contraire car à 4 joueurs, le principe de "2 donneurs et 2 receveurs" génère des offres déséquilibrées entre les duos de joueurs ce qui terni l’expérience de jeu.

► COMMENTAIRE(S) ABRÉGÉ(S):
- THÈME : quasi-abstrait; peu ressenti.
- Aide de jeu : non-inclus mais j’aurais aimé qu’il y en ait 1 par joueur.
- Adversaires : plus agréable lorsqu’il est joué avec des joueurs de même calibre.
+ Icônes : les icônes sont faciles à comprendre ou à mémoriser.

► REMARQUE(S) PERSONNELLE(S):
! J’ai peu d’intérêt pour les jeux abstraits et habituellement je les évite.

3 joueurs. Un jeu qui me plaît malgré son côté abstrait (ce qui est assez rare pour moi). J'apprécie particulièrement sa mécanique de "celui qui partage choisi en dernier" et le ratio plaisir / durée est adéquat. Malheureusement, au moment où j'écris ces lignes, ce jeu est seulement disponible dans l'usagé alors qu'à mon avis il mériterait d'être réimprimé.

RATING: 5
The divide-and-choose aspect of the game gets a bit easier with more plays, but being first to choose can make a huge difference in the game, and since that's determined randomly each turn, it can end up hosing a player.  The area control aspect of the game is neat, as is the aforementioned mechanic, but if one person is not as good at dividing the stacks as the other players, then it's going to cause a swing one way or the other.  This one will require more playings.

Love this game. The ebb and flow of influence in the districts is wonderful. The complaints that I've read center around down time as people are trying to figure out how to divide the cards. I didn't find this to be an issue, and I play with slow people, because you can spend the time studying the board or talking at the table with the other person who is waiting. My only regret is that it's a 3 or 4 player game. If it accommodated more or fewer players, I could get it to the table more often. As it is, everyone I introduce it to loves it, so I get to play it with some frequency.

this must be played in 3 players and it's fantastic. ok, there's some luck, but you, most of all, have this wonderfully tough decisions about dividing and choosing cards. AWESOME!
Played in 4 players, there's this fact that you can too often be without Doge cards and you can't do anything about it. The game still plays very well, but luck can be unbearably important.
The 9 , a full 9, is for the 3-players game

Good game; In the vein of El Grande, but slightly lighter and a little more random so it was for a while easier to get play of.

RATING: 8
Wrangling for political influence in Italy has never been so fun.  This is a fine area-majority game with a very unique twist.  Players take turns having to decide how to split a set of action cards and penalty cards.  Once the cards are split into piles (one pile per player), the other players get to choose which pile they each want to take.  Players are constantly involved and making decisions, and the game is thoroughly enjoyable.

After two plays, the game is interesting but there are things I don't like: It seems that the mental effort required to split the cards well is too great for the payoff you get in a "good split," and it's too easy to beat on the leader. So you put in tons of effort, split the cards well, and your reward is that the other players beat on you and pull you back anyway.

Pretty good area control for 3 players. Doesn't feel light or forced and pulls it off pretty well. Played quickly with 3. Since its a pseudo auction game players will have to get familiar with cards to give them an actual value. I think scoring cards went pretty easily/cheap for us but that's my opinion. Some spite cards liven things up.

Some situations not adequately explained in rule book, but handling them was simple.

I was really impressed with what I saw, and enjoy the "I cut, you choose" dynamic, which makes for some really interesting decisions -- which can sometimes beautifullly backfire! [UPDATE] I really, really like San Marco conceptually. I really, really like the production quality and decisions generated. But, it can be *incredibly* frustrating -- it feels you can be done in by luck of the draw (yours or your opponents') with little room to maneuver or fight back.

It's one of the more beautiful and elegant titles that I own.  The "splitting the pie" mechanism is particularly enjoyable and interesting.  Oddly the game has significant randomness in a 4-player game and much less in a 3-player game.  In a four player game there are two pies being split, and if you are unlucky then your opponents get the good cards in their pie and you don't.  Whereas, in a 3-player game, there's just one pie being split three ways, so it feels like everyone gets more fair access to the same pool of cards.  Wonderful turn angst.  I love it!

The uniqueness of the limit cards; how cards are divided up; the use of bridges to limit movements, as well as the possibility of an extra turn make this game above average.

Not impressed at all.  One good mechanic does not a game make, and that's all there is with San Marco.  Area-influence games are done so much better with other titles.  So make up a different game with the "I cut, you choose" mechanic!

Updated rating: Really an annoying game - too much luck with 4 and too much downtime with 3 (and it pretends to be a brain-burner...)
Comes some years too late. Definitely a El Grande rip-off. It adds some nice elements to your standard majority game but has a lots of cons: The downtime is unbelievable - someone distributes the cards and all others can go out for a short walk, then one player each picks a stack while the other sill can enjoy their walk. It looks like you can calculate every plus and minus of moves but the card luck can screw everything and in the end you spent way too much time on single decision that just don't have an appropiate impact on the outcome. Play El Grande (faster, more interaction) or Manhatten (lighter, less downtime) instead!

p.s. components are great, really loved the game at first sight but the gameplay just doesn't hold up to it

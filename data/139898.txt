RATING: N/A

RATING: 3
Rating is based on a single play of the PnP, so take it with a grain of salt.

There seems to be some fundamental flaws in the game.  The first player should just rotate.  It's difficult to even get at the action space in the first few rounds, since the partnerships are being snapped up.  This leads to one player keeping the 1st player marker for the first few rounds.

The game begins with an overwhelming amount of choices at the beginning and narrows to minimal choices by half way through the game, though the play length does keep this from being a major issue.

In our 4 Player game, the malt market reduced dramatically by the end of the game.  It was all you could do to grab enough to brew a single beer each round.  Do to this fact, it seems like the choices for how you develop your tech are pretty much a given:
1: Push the basic ingredient track to the 3rd spot
2: Push the advanced ingredient track to the 3rd spot.

This was disappointing based on how open the game felt at the start.

RATING: 7
1 play / 3 players (4h playtime!)

LIKE: Super crunchy game with some interesting combos. The design is good because you observe that a lot of resources needed for creating beers are slightly out of reach, unless you plan ahead efficiently. Theme is good, I enjoy beer.

DISLIKE: Takes a play to understand the synergies and the helper cards, so opportunities are quickly lost to more knowledgable players. Turn order is important. A lot of power bonuses are easily forgotten, because there are so many of them. Some text is difficult to read.

OVERALL: Very good game. Makes me want to try the beers after playing. There's a lot of replayability because the options are numerous. There is little direct player interaction, but I did feel some elbow bumping from turn order.

[b]Agricola[/b]-style worker placement/engine building with some order fulfillment.  Seems like there are quite many paths to victory.  It's nothing really new, but decently executed.  Some of the icons are pretty small and the colors/names aren't the best, but otherwise the production quality is good.  The theme doesn't do anything for me, though.

I was surprised by how quick and simple this game turned out to be, compared with other worker placement games. It was easy to teach without sacrificing too much depth of strategy, and it finished up in about an hour (record time compared to T'zolkin and the rest). Also, beer!

My only gripe is that there are a million chits, so I'm very glad for my GameTrayz solution. I've also become a little disappointed in the art/components for this game, especially when compared with a game like Viticulture (and how could you not?).

Played one full game me vs the solo AI, after one 2-player me vs me (Rahdo style). Really enjoyed the game, the theme is well integrated, there's a lot of variety, and (at least with 2 players) it didn't seem too difficult to get the ingredients together and brew. Lots of bits, not too bad for setup/teardown now that they are all sorted into bags, but it does take some time to set up (an additional 5 minutes on either side of the game)

In Brew Crafters, players assume management of a local craft brewery, working hard to manage resources, use their workers wisely, and develop their brewing line to create the best local brews.

RATING: 6
Thematically very strong (obviously a labor of love) worker placement game that allows players to build their own breweries and produce beer.  The theme and thematic components are so strong they have a tendency to obscure the fact that much of the game is spent on rather mundane worker placements, i.e. get resources and convert them into beers, again and again.  For those who love beer, craft brews and breweries, I can readily see the appeal of this game; I do not begrudge its high ratings among this crowd.  Since I am not such a person, Brew Crafters merely felt amusing to me, not particularly fun.

RATING: 9
The game upgrade kit for the resources makes the game look awesome. It flows well and with the actual shapes I don't have to look at the rule book so often to make sure Im getting the right resources. Same goes for new players. One major complaint about this game for some will be the set up. But its worth it, and there are lots of options for advanced play. The game also changes depending on player count. But this game is deeper than the average. Not a gate way game at all.

Such an astonishingly fun game, and my favorite yet from Dice Hate Me. Solid worker placement, lots of options available even when playing the basic game, easy to follow mechanics that don't sacrifice strategy or depth. The components are magnificent, especially the first player Beer and the batch chits, and everything feels intuitive if you've had any experience with the genre. Lots of ways to score, simple actions for building up your Brewery, hiring shifts or special workers, and plenty of options for variation: multiple Advanced recipes, optional action tiles, and so forth ensure you can keep coming back to it. Also really like the fact you can do Collaboration actions with 3+ players. A must have for me...and you can't beat the subject matter :)

First Play: Basic structure of the game is very straightforward. The huge first step of the climb is understanding how the buildings works and their co-relation with other aspects of the game (and each other). The special staff cards also need referencing and cross referencing until they too are properly understood.

I feel we have just scratched the surface and a less risk averse first couple of seasons is probably the way to go to build an efficient engine.

A decent game with a wonderful theme. Basically a very lite version of Agricola, there are a lot of ways to customize your brewery with infrastructure, specialists, business deals, etc.

Brew Crafters was a Kickstarter Project which has the players competing for prestige as the best Micro Brewery in town.  To do this the players compete for ingredients, specialist staff and trade agreements in a common market.  Then they return to their Brewery to conduct research, build and enhance their infrastructure and of course brew beer.

What you get in the box is nothing less than "Deluxe" quality in my opinion.  You get heaps of options to jack up the replay value (with so many beers and employees you can play several games and never use the same two, forget the possible combinations).  

The real treat of Brew Crafters is that after you bump and battle with the other players in the common market, you get to return to your personal Brewery and then your free to focus on your strategy uninterrupted.  Players need to be careful not to focus too much on infrastructure and get to brewing beer because (like with so many engine builders) you have to battle the clock and make the most out of limited time and resources.

I find Brew Crafters a real treat.  It gives a lot (of fun and brain puzzling) and takes little back (in terms of downtime and negative interaction). We've frequently played a game and dove right back in after swapping out the cards to try a new strategy or plan of attack.  Brew Crafters takes pride and place as one of my favourite games.

We have enjoyed this game. It is a worker placement game in the vein of Agricola with a microbrewery theme. I have found it to be a good game to introduce non-gamer friends to, as the theme and relatively simple rules make it easy to pick up. The game is essentially a recipe fulfilling game where players use worker placement to compete over ingredients. There is lots of variability in the types of beers that can be brewed in a given game. In addition, I love the tech tree aspect with the Research to give eahc player a customization to their play style. In particular, this has a great timing element where players want to do this early, but you are limited in available actions.

We found the payment of workers to be well balanced(tight enough that you have to think about it, but not crazy brutal) and the overall game to be very well balanced (first 3 player game had all players within 3 points with totally different strategies!). I really think this is a fun worker placement game that is a bit more approachable to new players than Agricola.

I've played this a number of times and I really enjoy the game. I would be interested in maybe doing a variant where you draft one starting specialist (in reverse turn order maybe) from the pool of available ones. I love the game a lot but I feel like having them from the beginning could make it even better.

The first few times I played I had no idea you started with money. It really changed the game (for the better!) when I discovered that mistake!

Excellent worker placement game. The theme is very well implemented. The only reason I rate this lower than Agricola is because the feeding tension in Agricola is what draws me into that game. In Brew Crafters taking loans is not necessarily detrimental and can actually set you up for increased beer production. What I like better than Agricola is the implementation of theme where you can focus your brewery on pumping out lots of mass production beers or try more for complex craft brews. I highly recommend this game if you like worker placement.

First play review : Love it!  As a nanobrewer myself, I can tell you that many many things make sense in this game.  Not so many decisions were made to accomodate mecanics.  Ressources management at its best.  If you like tight worker placement where you struggle to do half of what you'd like, then this game is perfect.  This is not a game where resources are abundant, make a plan, adapt to opponents, make some hard choices between optimizing stuff or ruining your opponent's day...  yeah!  My kinda game!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Outstanding worker placement, resource management game.   Works well at all player counts 2-5. With 3 or more, collaboration feature is added. Takes 30 minutes per player but allow about 10 minutes for setup. The game does not drag as you are constantly planning out how you are going to time your actions to maximize efficiency. Definitely needs a box organizer.

But BC is not as fun as agricola, not as tight, has only 2 workers, and leaves a general sensation that there are too many things that simply can't be achieved.

This replaced Agricola for us.  First, the theme is a million times better.  Second, it has a wide variety of strategies based on the beers that come out, the special employees, and the chosen buildings.

Plus, it has the characteristic DHMG tech tree, where you can really specialize your strategy (cf. VivaJava, and VivaJava dice).  I also like the tie-ins to other DHMG.

The only downside is the setup, which is kind of annoying, but a million baggies has solved the problem for now.

It could use just a bit more variety in cards (special workers and recipes).  Maybe an expansion is in order??????

UPDATE: I played it again and still think it is an eight.  I like the asymmetrical labs.  Beer-making Agricola with more options.

I rated Brew Crafters an 8 after our first two player game.

I like the theme.  The game is balanced (first game ended 94 to 92).  There were lots of choices and although there are a few things that should be prioritized early, it seems like there are multiple paths to victory. We played the suggested game for newbies.  With the different skilled workers, beers, advanced research options, and market spaces, this game may have enough variety to stand the test of time.

Note: My game didn't come with the the lab marker cubes.  I am waiting to hear back from Dice Hate Me about replacements.

Its basically Agricola with a more interesting theme.  Has the same huge setup/teardown time and maybe a little more of a learning curve for first-time/non-Agricola players.  The pieces are high quality and the artwork very nice.  Played well with 2 players though I think it might have a run-away leader issue, could be better with more players. In the end I think I'd rather play Agricola because its a little easier to setup and explain and I think moves a little quicker overall.

RATING: 8.5
Awesome worker placement game that plays of the Agricola model with a great theme attached. Easy enough to get people who are not necessarily comfortable with worker placement games but enjoy beer to sit down for this one. The selection of different recipes keeps the game from playing the same every time but doesn't add quite as much depth as I would like. Building your brewery piece by piece is quite fun and really gives you a 'look what I did' feel at the end of the game.

Quite interesting that you can craft a strategy similar to real life breweries and still be competitive. Want to be that super trendy craft brewery and only pump out a few IPAs per year? You can do that. Want to crank out case after case of light beer in mass production? You can do that. Want to be the brewery that just invests in new technologies and hardly focuses on beer? You can do that too. 

Overall a lot of fun and definitely staying on my shelf despite the number of worker placement games I have.

I don’t get this game. In fact, I avoided it for almost a year before finally trying simple due to how my geekbuds rated it. On paper it sounds like a lackluster Agricola knockoff, but I’m floored at how much I’m enjoying it. It’s as if the designer played Agricola and thought it’d be better to have true paths of specialization and a variable setup each game, so he went off and made that game.

Now, it is a resource collection and conversion to VPs game, no doubt, but what makes it stand out for me is the way you use Skilled Workers (“Occupations”) and brewery upgrades  (“Improvements”) that are much more powerful, focused, and easy to put into play than Agricola. The result is that everyone differentiates in how they collect resources, move beer through their brewery, and score VPs. There’s even a farm improvement that allows you to sow and then reap for big spasms of cube payouts. 

For me, the whole comes together in a way that’s greater than the sum of the parts. I enjoy the freedom the game gives you to craft your own set of bonus powers while still appreciating the tight slog that Agricola is. Not that it isn't tight (money is definitely super tight), but it feels much looser than Agricola. There are three winter seasons were you have to pay costs (“Harvest”), but you have plenty of time to prepare them, and even if you can’t pay all your expenses, it’s not fatal. I’ve seen a player end up with -8 points in loans and still win. 

Put another way, you know how in Agricola once you get your engine really humming along the game ends? You get there sooner in BC and get to ride that engine longer. If you like Agricola and that concept appeals at all, I suggest you at least give it a try. 

Lastly, there’s a nice element of variety in the game setup. You won’t have the same Skilled Workers or beer recipes in any game (I think 9 of 24 total each), so each game will have a slightly different slant.

On the downside, I will say that the game is a beast a la Caverna in terms of fiddly bits. I got the trays from Game Trayz that cost about what the game itself costs, but some games demand organization, and I think this and Caverna are poster children. You'll want something beyond bags -- there are 24 sets of beer chits alone!

***CHANGES IN 2ND EDITION***
There are several graphics design improvements, but only 3 gameplay changes:

1. The Local partnership action was moved to be an "OR" space on the fundraiser. This makes the start player space more competitive, especially in early rounds.

2. The Event Planner skilled worker was made a bit more powerful. She now gets you an extra $1 along with any ingredient when you use the fundraiser action space.

3. The requirements for the Tour and Tasting room were simplified. Instead of 3 separate requirements, there is now just one: have a total operating cost (skilled workers, equipment and brewery shifts) of at least $12. You still start the game with an operating cost of $5.

Review after 1 play.

[b]The theme[/b]: The brew crafting theme felt really fresh to me as I have never played a similar game (and don't know how many are out there :) ). I would say that for a euro game, the theme was mostly consistent and could be easily felt in the gameplay. 

[b]The visuals[/b]: Polarizing. The illustration on the box is great. All of the cards good as well. But the boards...omg, those are just a great example of a terribly looking thing that when I see while looking up a game, I usually decide not to look further into it because I just hate this type of german euro-y look. Bleh.

[b]The fun[/b]: It is one of those thinky euro games where you usually want people to be silent so you can focus on developing your strategy. Nothing wrong with that, of course, as it is deffinitely not a beers and pretzels game :)

[b]The gameplay[/b]: I hate [thing=31260][/thing] with all my heart so when my friend introduced it as something similar, I was a little bit scared. But I actually did enjoy this :) Yes, after every year, you have to pay for everything you own or suffer serious repercusions but you do that with money that you are producing anyway so you don't need to change your strategy because of that. I loved how each of us chose totally different strategy and they all seem viable. I think that the mechanisms did a very good job capturing the theme. All in all, it was a very pleasant experience with tons of long term strategy and one of the games that would deffinitely go even better with repeated plays.

I really didn't know what to expect from it, but I had to order my own copy as soon as it was available.

Beautiful gameplay, beautiful components.

Very thematic (we do say malts and hops. It's not browns and greens for us).

It has great, important choices that completely change each game.
There is a lot of game in such a little box!
Very interesting. Very well designed.

I wasn't keen on the theme and hated the graphic design, but the core gameplay is actually really good.  However, there are problems with player count scaling and the first player action is broken (which the designer has acknowledged) - plus the usual Kickstarter bloat with extra bits, not all of which seemed terribly well balanced.  
Some professional development by a publisher could have pushed this from good (but flawed) to great.

After one play, rating this as a solid 9 that may go up after further plays. The game was on the long side (although I didn't think it felt long at the time), but unlike Agricola it rarely felt like there were just no useful moves to make, although one move was usually obvious as being better.

I'd definitely like to play again soon, particularly at different player counts and with a standard (rather than beginner) setup, to see how the different Special Worker cards play out, along with the unique player labs.

I really enjoyed this play and players who like things to be REALLY tight in their games will also like it. The theme is great on this one too and there is a ton of variety in the base game.

Two plays with five, one with four. Like Agricola, but less frustrating. It's a little too long and complicated for my taste these days, and it's probable that, outside of the special workers and local partners, there is an ideal strategy baked in (farm, warehouse and brew pub may be no-brainers?). However, having said all that, it's still very enjoyable to put together a plan and follow it through.

Sandbox worker placement game. There are many paths to victory and a component for each one. The game suffers from too many very similar options. To be efficient, you must pigeon-hole to one type of production, making all but one or two of the dozens of components worthless to you. The game is hurt by its lack of direction and choice to forgo a board. However, the theme is great and the bonus to be the first to produce each type of beer gives a unique race element. Otherwise, this is standard worker placement.

Agricola with beer. This is the sort of game that I'm rapidly tiring of. Seen in isolation it's well enough done, but it's so obviously derivative (Agricola, Caylus) that it's not worth serious attention. If you want a re-skinned Agricola, by all means get this, personally I'm happier with the original.

A neat little economic game in which players compete to make beer from recipes.  There are two action stages, which I found interesting, and the conveyor belt by which the beer is made introduces a timing element to the game that I enjoy.  Not sure that all the factory additions are balanced (thinking of the farm in particular).  (1 play)

Played last year at a friend's place. This game incorporates theme well into the cycles of play. Portions of hops, yeast, and malt must be acquired, the seasonal cycles allow for growth and harvest, and there is a gentle nudge to diversify your product. A subset of many different brews to create in each game and specialist workers to hire create replayability. Variants included in the game allow you to add depth as you please. 

My largest mark against this game can be found in its title; the only reasonable way to score victory points is truly by crafting beer. While this doesn't seem like a problem, it does funnel players towards a particular path near the last third of the game; at that time, it's more a game of solitaire than an interactive euro.

RATING: 6
Played a few times and while it is a fun and pretty worker placement game, it feels like the game is just beginning as it is ending. There should be more game rounds for it to be more satisfying. The research area is nice but I feel like its worthless, you really can't progress far. Money is too tight to be able to research instead of brewing.

I really should like this game more.  The theme is a winner for me and the theme works well with the mechanics.  

I generally like opaque games with tough decisions and games where it's hard to assess the best move.  But, I feel lost and aimless when playing this game, which is not something I enjoy.

Basically, I'm a monkey randomly pulling levers when playing this.  Not an uncommon feeling for me in most complex games when first playing, but by mid-way through most games I tend to have a generally feeling as to what I should be doing.  I've played this twice now and still have no idea how to play it better or what I should be doing to be successful.  In many games, this feeling is I almost view as a plus.  But, it feels more like a negative here.

The beermaking theme was fun, in particular the different beer brands were nicely done, and there are enough ways to customize your brewery to make it fell unique and your own. But that said this is really just a fairly by the numbers tight worker placement. I like it and am happy to play it but it doesn't do anything interesting enough to make me excited to play it.

This is quite similar to Agricola but a bit streamlined and more entry-level.  That said, as much as my 10-year old daughter liked Agricola, this was her favorite game (overall) for some time.

That 8 is provisional, but I feel like it might go up?

No bonus points for theme here: I hate beer, and I am generally "meh" towards worker placement.  (My favorite examples tend to be hybrids, like Belfort.)

This system is so tight, and reasonably balanced, and thought-provoking without too much AP.  I've had a half dozen moments in my first few sit downs with this where I just nodded in silent appreciation of the designer's / playtesters' work.  

The rulebook is great.  The graphic design and the art are phenomenal.  The chits are a little fiddly to set up, but fun and thematic in-game.  

Prefer this to Agricola because it feels more optimistic (let's bang out this exotic Stout recipe!) than dreary (if I don't produce two more carrots this turn my kid will die.)  Also - all the different cards and building combos in Agricola can feel overwhelming at times, especially for someone who doesn't play it regularly.  This is more manageable, but has comparable depth in setup variety, strategies, etc. 

Tl;dr this is an underappreciated gem.  Play it now.

First play: I was stuck in third place for most of the game (when I wasn't in fourth), so it was a struggle. Many times, I wanted to take the start player token, but someone else was in the space, either because they wanted the money, or frequently, because they wanted the other option on the space. Over and over again, the players ahead of me took the resources (malt, really) that I needed. It was really unexpected that it would be so vital to be in one of the top two positions. It got really frustrating. I guess I should try it again to see if that was a fluke.

RATING: 4
Possibly one of the best themed games I've seen.

Brewpub seems overpowered (2 slots to make a brew). It has a lot of synergies with other cards, etc. Speaking of which, the specialist cards seem to be important to get first, perhaps some better than others. Went last in the first round? Too bad, the good one is gone.

Lots of marginal improvement decisions. It's an engine that lumbers along at a very slow pace and then picks up at the end, or never at all, depending on your luck and timing. The tech trees don't complement well and it just seems like a race to get as many "annual winter" upgrades so that they ding before the winter phase. The end game tech tree VP possibilities seem marginal - as if you could get about the same doing something else on board.

Very tedious, too long for what it is doing. Probably tries to be an Agricola weighted game but there's really not that much to do or think about. You are just trying to get the right ingredient parts while upgrading things and having the cash to pay for it all. It never felt like there was really much I was doing or could do at any given time.

Seems somewhat easy to "crash" your engine by not getting the right parts in place for things to streamline later. Or you buy too much and have to take too many loans out.

The amount of AP to churn out a couple of points is ridiculous - you can always score points, but maybe if you spent 10 minutes number crunching, you could get an extra 1-3 points with some wacky sequence of actions in the final couple of seasons. Goa does this so much better at the end of the game.

Not bad, but it just felt like a worse Agricola. You're just kind of doing the same thing every round- get some resources, make the beers, get a few bucks, etc. I love the theme, but it just doesn't gel as a coherent package.

I'm generally pretty sour on worker placement games with this many tiny bits, but the guy who had it had everything organized pretty well, and everything is there for a reason.  The game has a nice flow to it as you expand your operation and look ahead to what you'd like to brew in a few turns. Money is tight, and some of the worker placement spots seem a bit stronger than others, but knowing what's best for you now and fighting over the first player token is what these games are all about, I guess.

I'd have to play it again and see if I still like it if I'm doing poorly.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (August 2015)

At first I was incredibly keen on trying Brew Crafters, then we played the card game and I hated it, so my excitement vanished, but I finally (and reluctantly) played Brew Crafters. I can say I liked it, a lot.

When I read the rules, the game seemed incredibly easy, but it isn’t. Brew Crafters is one of those games with very easy rules (I can explain them under 10 minutes) but with meaty and interesting decisions. It is a worker placement game (nothing new here) but is very hard to do well in it, that is, it is very tense when time passes and you accomplish so little. You want to do much more than you can realistically do, in this regard this is even harder than Agricola. Some people hate this but I love this aspect of the game. 

At first I was worried about the replayability factor, but it seems it is very high. It has lots of recipes, specialists and buildings. I’m a little worried about the specialists because there is only one of each, so first players have the chance to grab them before anyone else and this is pure luck. I feel it is unfair to have this in a strategy game, perhaps many of the workers can fill the same role. I need to play more to see if this is an issue for me.

An action space (Start player or Partnership) seems very overpowered to me. The first player can block this space taking the powerful partnership AND keeping his first player status. This feels kind of unfair. In my games the first player has always done this and as first player is chosen randomly this leaves a bittersweet taste in my mouth, a player will have an unfair and powerful advantage solely by luck. HOWEVER in my games the first player has also lost the game so perhaps this isn’t as unbalanced as it seems. All I can say about this is that it bugs me and I need to find out if it is unbalanced or not.
 
Brew Crafter´s components are very good, however one of my boards came slightly damaged. I dislike the art of the specialists but I can’t really say why, for some reason, I feel it is kind of cheap. I’m neutral toward the theme (I don’t like beer) but my friends seemed to enjoy it. As I know almost nothing about beer, I’m not sure if the theme and game mechanism are in sync, but from my limited perspective it seems to be the case.

My copy of the game arrived with one player board with minor damage, but it bothers me a bit.

Bottom line, Brew Crafters is a frustrating, tight, hard game, but all of these are positives for me :D. For now, it is a keeper in my game collection and I want to play it again soon. I need to check if the first player has an unfair advantage.

I finally played Brew Crafters with all the options added in. 

I’m not sure why they are called Complex Actions as they are very easy to understand AND make the game a lot easier and less tense (because they provide more actions/resources in the same amount of turns).

The actions Community Farm and Traders Market allow you to get what you need. There are some timing considerations, but overall, they make the game less tense due to the increased amount of resources available.

I’m not a fan of the Develop Secret Recipe and Employment Agency actions as they introduce random elements to the game after players begin playing. As an strategy game this can have a profound impact in the game. I also dislike when a player is the only one capable of building something or using a power just because they took the action before any other player.

The Hire Interns action also seem to benefit the first players and as you can defend the first player position they seem very powerful to me as they add extra actions that can be used in any phase and you don’t have to pay for them in winter. They seem overpowered but I have won the game without using them, so perhaps I´m mistaken about the power level.

And to end this comment, I’m also unsure about the balance of the advanced Lab Research boards. In my last game I was able to get 3 reputation tokens each time I brewed a new recipe for the first time and my friends complained about this, they said my board was way too powerful (and I won the game). I’m not sure about that and I need more plays to verify, but my gut feeling tells me, the boards aren´t that unbalanced.

It would seem everything I said about the game is negative, but I still find it fascinating and I want to play it again soon. All of these issues didn’t make the game less appealing to me. I know that´s weird but it’s the honest truth :D. I really enjoy Brew Crafters.

Solid game!

After another play, this one is obviously a keeper and an amazing game. It features the hallmarks of many great worker placement games, and the feeling of running a brewery is definitely present throughout.

This game is good with 2, but it really shines with more since you get the chance to participate in the collaboration brewery action. I've also been especially impressed with how thematic the game is! Brew Crafters deserves more love!

Backed on KickStarter, while eagerly awaiting the mid-2014 release, have played 5-6 times with the PnP version.  There's alot going on in this game, which is similar to Agricola but with zero luck once the game is set up.  Looks like a very solid design, with lots of extras from meeting KS stretch goals to guarantee replayability.  Rating could go up to a 9 if, with more play, there are multiple proven paths to victory (I have only seen two different strategies work thus far).

EDIT:  Now that the game has come out, and I have played a few more times, I am bumping the rating up to a 9.  I believe there are multiple paths to victory, in addition to a tremendous amount of replayability given the added items from all the KS goals.  This is simply one of the best worker placement games of all-time.  Got to figure out which game it will replace on my all-time top 10.

2 Plays.
First play was just the basic game, it was good.  I liked it but I knew quickly if this was all the game was it was a bad game.

However the second play I tried 2 players only and even though the other player was new we decided to mix it up and try going more advanced for game setup.  It was ubnelievably different, so good, so tight on all options, but it was a great game.  I enjoyed it fully from beginning to end and it was a much closer game (I lost by 4).  The base game is just that, like Agricola the base/family game should be played once so you learn it then throw out those rules.

This game could be expanded upon so easily it seems, it's all about finding the perfect balance of actions vs players as well. Love the diversity of actions, will probably consider adding a 4th season at some point to all my games and switching the local partnerships to share a spot with the fundraising like Rosset has said a 2nd edition would do.

The perfect business game. You run a microbrewery. By improving your plant and aiming for premium craft beers you can create a business success. Thematic. Addictive. The only game I've ever come across where the box is too small for the bits. Easily adapted for solo play.

Heavier Euro Style play. Plan your game early and get an engine planned out. I normally am not as much of a fan of the pure Euro games like this that involve very little PvP, but because I am a huge Craft Beer fan this game works on all levels for me. The Theme makes it work.
Also the components are very good, the artwork as well. Overall a top notch game.

Play is similar as an Agricola or Puerto Rico style of game.  Unlike Agricola or PR, it doesn't seem to be deep strategies but I've only played once and using just the Basic Lab.  It has more horizontal flow than vertical depth, in terms of building an engine and beer output.  It seems like its a mistake to try and produce as much beer as possible.  Ingredients are difficult to accumulate in our 4-player session.  Maybe the Advanced Lab has deeper nuances...  Overall, it's a solid game with plenty of moving parts.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

My first play was rough just trying different things but I was just able to make enough money to pay for everything by the end of each year.  I'm uncertain about the replay value, but am wanting to give this another go with more players.  Two player games are fine, but I expect this game will shine more brightly with 3-4 or maybe even 5.  Game play is straightforward although you do need to be able to plan ahead well enough.  Don't ignore research.

RATING: 4
This is admittedly a comment after a little over half of one play on a PnP version of the game, but I just don't find this comparing favorably with the other worker placement games I'm familiar with. There's a lot of piece fiddling on comparatively few actions with a tight economy -- sort of like Agricola, except that there's even more pressure to stay above water in Brew Crafters than in Misery Farm.

I also don't think much of the specialist system, with powerful and unique special abilities up for grabs at the very start of the game, their distribution largely dictated by the luck of initial turn order. A player's first option shouldn't be "I'll grab this thing that will be useful to me the entire game and which no other player will ever have access to".

There are plenty of nice components (although the images were a little grainy), and a decent variety of things to do, between upgrading your brewery and doing lab research and hiring specialized personnel, but all that can't hide the fact that most of what you're doing is math. You need X amount of ingredients to make Y recipe, that's about it. This is far from the most engaging resource management game I've ever played. You do kinda feel like you're running a brewery, but it's not an entirely immersive experience.

The thing I liked most is the the two-stage worker placement. You have two meeples for placement in the first stage, and you start with one for the second, but you can hire up to two more. I think some interesting games can be made incorporating that concept.﻿

Revised opinion:
Long on set-up and play time, lots of up-front reading to be done and you need to be invested throughout to win. Slightly stressful as you cannot afford to let your concentration lapse and there's little downtime. Rating improved playing the advanced version - this is a very good and tightly wound game with many ways to victory if you can set your plan and stick to it. Not one I'll play all the time, but with a solo version I could get lost in here!

Bought 8/3/16 at Kingslayer Comics using MTG Store Credit.

Some agricola-like mechanisms.  Skilled workers are like occupations.  Lab research are like Minor Improvements.  Paying workers is a bit like feeding.  However, the game is a bit lighter due to the smaller board.  I like the variable Skilled Workers, Advanced Beers, and Lab Boards.  Setup is ridiculously fiddly, but I'm sure it will improve with a foamcore insert.

Different enough to justify having this + Agricola + Caverna.  May end up trying this out as a semi-gateway game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A solidly mediocre game which cribs most of its mechanisms directly from Agricola.  Below average components and lousy graphic design did nothing to endear the game to me.

It isn't a bad game, but it is entirely forgettable, though I strongly suspect it will appeal to home brewers and beer connoisseurs on the strength of its theme.

I'll see if the speed of play increases going forward.

Very pleasantly surprised by this one.  I honestly expected a watered down Agricola with an awesome theme.  Instead, I got a well done hybrid between Caverna and Agricola that holds its own...with an awesome theme.  There is a fair amount of openness to the game like Caverna.  Players are able to openly pursue different strategies as they please.  Like Agricola, the action selection boards are both tight (even the 2nd phase that doesn't allow blocking), and the tension is great.  There is some randome setup to each game that may appear subtle at first, but will definitely influence the direction that every game takes.

Let me tell you right now, this game is Excellent!! The amount of replay-ability out of the box is insane... 24 Skilled Workers and only 9 are in the game to be hired... 21 Advanced Beer Recipes and only 6 used in each game, Basic Lab Research Boards that on the other side have different Advanced Lab Research abilities (5 different boards to try)... Optional Complex Action spaces that you can add to the game board expanding the choices you can make in each turn... my hat's off to Ben Rosset.

The game is tight... very very tight... money has to be managed very carefully because loans are expensive in terms of victory points, and money at a glance can be a bit misleading because all the actions you take are FREE... yes, free... you don't pay to get resources... you don't pay get equipment, buildings, skilled workers, etc... everything is free until the end of the year... at that point you have to pay all your operational costs.
So you can take take take but beware... Winter is Coming! And then you have to pay 

The mechanics of the game are simple... the game isn't complex but the choices are hard and I love that!

Love the art of the game, the names of the beers are just great.

This game is okay. I would prefer to have an actual board instead of 4 separate panels. The advanced ingredients are too difficult to get for how important they are to advanced brews; the game tries to cap you at 1 adv. ingred. per season which slows down your brewing potential. I don't understand why the local partnerships are free, which makes getting them SO strong. The first time you play will be a crap-shoot (there's a bunch of equipment, skilled workers, and partnerships to read through and you just have to get lucky with your strat).

Players own a brewing company, starting with 2 workers and a shift worker. You use your 2 workers to collect resources, hire skilled workers or get more shift workers in Agricola fashion. Your shift worker lets you build, brew beer or do research. There are 6 different types of resources to generate many types of beer. 

I enjoy playing this game. The research chart lets you pursue a certain strategy, and it seems more balanced than the chart in Goa. The worker placement is modeled after Agricola, but you only have 2 of them, so it is a bit streamlined that way. There are lots of possibilities to explore and many things to consider. I'm looking forward to more plays. My rating is likely to rise with more plays.

A brilliant game at 3 players where nothing comes easy. And when players have "built their engine", things get still harder for there no increase of ressources to fuel all those engines. 
however at five players the game was incredibly slow, and very unpleasant to play. The moves did not allow for any mistakes so players were even slower to place their workers and more than once placing the second worker was about trying to avoid the worst... i'll never play it again at five.

RATING: 7
Better than Agricola, by far.  And with the n-decks built into the initial loadout so that when you're ready you can shuffle up the extra cards and use them in place of the standard setup.  And just like Agricola, it says it can seat 5 players... but you do not want to play this game with 5 players.

That said, I really need to play this game again, because it feels like -- and I can't confirm this yet -- if you pick a sub-optimal strategy at the start of the game you're not coming back.

After one play, this seems... okay.  You build a money and victory point engine with what's actually a fairly small set of turns and choices, from what I can see of the game.  I'm once again confused by how a game with so many nice components can have a deal-breaker in design -- in this case, the descriptions of the special buildings, that are written in tiny, tiny font on small cheatsheet cards.  Really?

[b]Brew Crafters[/b]

[i]This was a tough one for me to rate because I did enjoy the game play. I love the theme (being a huge craft beer fan) and I love WP games, so I asked myself why it fell flat for me. I ended up basing my rating on where Brew Crafters would fit into the WP games I really enjoy [i](specifically my two favorites - [thing=31260][/thing] and [thing=118048][/thing]).[/i] 

[COLOR=#FF0000][i]Thoughts on Agricola versus Brew Crafters:[/i][/color]

A lot of people are comparing it to Agricola and I don't think they feel that similar. BC does not have nearly the amount of variability during set up that Agricola has (due to the occupation and minor improvement cards in Agricola). There is also not the same tension in BC, yes you have to pay your employees but that is much easier to accomplish as opposed to feeding your family in Agricola.

The similarities to Agricola are similar game length and weight plus the fact that both are WP games. If I want to play a heavier WP game I would choose Agricola because I love how the cards you get in the beginning of a game of Agricola can completely change how you will play the game compared to other plays you've had. 

[COLOR=#FF0000][i]Thoughts on Targi versus Brew Crafters:[/i][/color]

Why Targi you ask... because Targi offered something brand new to the WP genre when it came out, the spacial element of placing workers to get certain goods/tribe cards. All of this is packed into a 1 hour experience [i](including set up).[/i]

I had fun playing Brew Crafters, but it felt like more of the same without offering anything new to the experience. I haven't played with 2 yet, but a 3p and 4p game took a few hours to play and there were plenty of turns where my optimal move was quite apparent. 

In closing, while I enjoyed my plays of Brew Crafters it doesn't stand up to the variability of Agricola or the innovation of Targi.
I will happily play again, but it is not a game I feel the need to add to my collection.[/i]

Surprisingly quick worker placement economic cube-pushing game. Beer aficionados might take issue with some of the recipes, but should otherwise be tickled by the theme. But man, there has to be a better way to introduce the variety the designer wanted without an overload of components and the fiddly set up that accompanies it.

One of the very best worker placement games I have ever played - better than Agricola
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I like the game more than Agricola. Good feel to gameplay. For learning and playing, as Ryan Sturm would say, Brew Crafters is a double black diamond.

Much replayability. The base learning game is okay, but the real game is when everything is brought into the fray. Not a great 2player.

This game teached me that brewing beer is 
- not much fun
- mostly work
- not terrible exiciting
- youre lucky if your break even after 3 years ;-)

Seriously though: Mainly youre preoccupied with micromangaing your ressources to fulfill orders. Nothing that hasnt been done before and not terribly exciting. It does work, but I couldnt find a spark of genius or excitement anywhere. 
Even in a 5-player-game its not too interactivce. You get blocked out of spaces of course, but if you get 2 malt or 3 is not the most interesting outcome in the world... 
The 2- worker-part-mechanism is the most original thing, but imho it slows the game down instead of making it interesting. It just means you occasionaly miss outr on brewing two beers or it makes the storage worthwile.
I also finde the lack of originaly in the buildings and mostly in the cards (and the extra spaces) disturbing: Storage, brewing and selling in 2 steps insetad of 3, an extra VP here and there or an extra cube... Nothing out of the ordinary.
Maybe my hopes were to high, but safe the theme I cant find anything here, that I cant find in other games that play faster and are more exciting.
Sorry!

I love Beer! So the the theme of the game is great.  That said it also plays very well.  The rules are clear, the system is similar to Agricola.  In many ways it is simpler to play and the a bit of a cleaner more stream lined game.

Traded away after one play.

It was enjoyable but the only thing this game has over my beloved Agricola is theme. Setup is a bear, those little beer tokens are a pain to organize, and it is nowhere as streamlined or as polished as Agricola. I couldn't ever see taking this off the shelf instead of Agricola (or even Caverna) so away it went.

RATING: 3
2 plays - This isn't a terrible game, but it's not great either. 

A major down, is that this is a very fiddly game. I suppose if you organised the crazy amount of tokens it into plano containers it would be a lot better, but boy it's annoying. It also has a lot of cards, which just make a messy table, rather than the resemblance of a board game. The main board is quite small in comparison to the rest of the game, which feels really odd. The player boards have decent artwork and are a saving grace for an otherwise very messy looking/ operating game. 

In terms of gameplay, the worker placement is okay, but certainly not anything more interesting than any other board games around. It utilizes some similar mechanics to caverna/ agricola, with some action spaces that are refilled/ increase in value over time, while others offer static benefits. As you go, you slowly build a brew crafting engine. While the gameplay is okay, there are lots of games that do the same, but the fiddliness, and "stuff" everywhere, aspect to it is just exhausting and annoying.

Overall, average game play, but not fun at all to play! I feel sorry to give the rating, because the mechanical design is decently thought out.

Brew Crafters is a worker placement game about building a microbrewery that definitely owes a lot of its gameplay elements to Agricola.  Like in Agricola, you put your worker on spaces and collect everything that's built up there.  The game doesn't have the endless cards of Agricola, which limits the strategic breadth somewhat.  Also, it's an economic game, so most improvements cost money, and you have to pay your workers instead of feeding them.  Money is very tight, and you probably won't be able to avoid loans.  On the whole, it was a good game, but it didn't really stand out.

Solid worker placement game. Lots of  chrome bits in the box. It takes a long time to explain the rules, but gameplay is straightforward. The extra brewery buildings and the expert staff add complexity to the options and decision making. You could skip those parts and the game works just as well for a faster initial play.

First impressions
The good: This is an interesting game with several paths to victory.  It has lots of different options that should keep the game fresh. It has a very cool theme. The cardboard six-pack chits look awesome. 
The less good: Although the overall flow of the rulebook is good, I found it lacking in detail (for example, why are buildings not included, but instead found on a card?). The game could definitely benefit from a player aid, with a brief overview of the main buildings and workers or at least a summary sheet in the back of the rulebook.

Wonderful Economic game. Building up your resources and engine to produce beer. I HATE beer. Like- so much hate! But I really enjoyed this game. I could feel the theme and if you like that then you should definitely try out this game. Worker placement with 2 phases. It is broken up very nice. They did an amazing job with this game. I can't wait to play it again- hopefully this weekend!

I met Ben at the WBC and had the chance to play a game of Brew Crafters. Needless to say, it was my personal favorite of the con. I need this game and will go to Kickstarter in October. It had a similar feel to Agricola, but had a beer theme and was better in my opinion.

RATING: 5
Brewcrafters is a game where each turn you go through two worker placement phases. In the first phase you collect resource cubes, and in the second phase your workers allow you to upgrade one of your boards or convert your cubes into dollars and points. At the end of every four turns, you have to pay dollars equal to the stuff you've unlocked. 

The first round of the game feels very slow, as it takes three production actions to unlock the extra worker to do a second produce/upgrade. In this game you don't really build a production engine. Your production ability is heavily at the mercy of what's left on the board when your turn comes around. What engine building exists is all about small increases in what you get with your gather actions, increasing the point values of what you produce or allowing you to produce more than one thing per turn if you managed to get enough cubes from the board. I found that the game actually presented me with very few hard decisions.  Many actions are more opportunism on a untaken resource pile, and less strategy.  One thing missing here is the tension you get in other, similar games where when you get a resource, you have to decide to spend that resource now, or save it and invest it to get a larger return later. This is totally absent as all the resources are spent for brewing, which in turn produces nothing other than a point token.

The game also has very powerful cards that are first come first get, that increase your ability to access different cubes. These are very important, and to not manage to get one due to turn order can be frustrating. Turn order is awkward to change, because the starting player spot is shared with one of these important card acquisition spots, so it's often occupied early, and often the card is taken which means starting player remains the same. 

Resources are so tight in this game that one wrong move and you don't get to make anything that turn. Opponents will block your plans consistently. There are minor component design issues. The components look very dull, and on some components they use symbols and colors and on others they refer to components by name, which mixes me up. This game goes very near to things that I've liked in other games, but it just falls far short of being enjoyable.

A worker placement/resource collection game. At least the theme of running a brewery goes along with idea of workers, resources and money. It provides variety by using a subset of beer formulas which need different resources and available specialist (powers) you can take and support. If you can't support you operations a loan hurts but is not fatal since you could make up the difference.
It comes together well several different options to specialize to build your engine for production.
Works well in its category.

This was a fun game that I enjoyed building up an engine to get beer brewing. I'd look forward to playing again. 

But after thinking about it for awhile it just doesn't quite elevate to being a great game or one I wish to own. It is a medium to heavy worker placement that takes probably around 30 minutes per player with some mild engine building and resource conversion aspects. 

Furthermore I didn't find the actions that varied during the main worker placement portion. I didn't feel much tension in picking spots or hoping the spot I wanted stayed open as almost all of the actions just give a variety of resources and there were always more ways to get the needed resources anyhow. 

Overall I think this is a smart and enjoyable game with a very fun theme but the gameplay falls short of being excellent. For a similar but better experience I'd pull out almost any Uwe game such as Le Havre, Agricola, or Caverna.

You're a start-up brewery looking to get into the market. You start your business from the ground up and see where that takes you in 2 years. Investing in the local talent and better facilities seems to be turning your business into a success story. Pretty soon you're the gold standard for a number of labels and a lot of people hold your brewery in high esteem. This my top 1 standard worker placement game. It has very deep mechanics and strategy, and is very heavy on the theme. There are numerous ways to win and lots of strategies to employ doing so. Very enjoyable heavy euro game.

I have played the game 5-7 times using the designer's testing copy.  I find this game to be a lot more enjoyable than the inevitable comparison to Agircola.  The game has great depth and replay-ability without the giant barrier of entry I found on Agricola.

The comparisons to Agricola are justified, except I do not much care for Agricola, and I very much enjoy Brew Crafters. Each round is extremely tense as your brewery needs to grow to score more points, but it also needs more money to support all of the fancy upgrades you install. There seems to be plenty of paths to victory. I like that the research track from VivaJava has carried over, and there are many different useful workers for hire for almost any situation. Really, the choices can be quite overwhelming and stressful, but I never feel out of control. Ultimately, this is a much tighter and better managed game than Agricola, and I hope it sees the attention it deserves.

:) [b]Limited and intuitive rule set[/b]: easy to teach and understand

:) The [b]small scope[/b] of the game (creating a small brewery) adds to its appeal

:) It is remarkable that despite the limited rule set, limited resources and limited action types, there is [b]real differentiation between player styles[/b] and the breweries they are building. It is perfectly possible to play an exciting match between players who are trying out totally different strategies (one pumping out huge amounts of cheap beer, another specializing in brewing premium beers, another in brewing all different kind of beers and another one focussing on specific goals combined with research).

:) The game feels like a [b]really challenging puzzle[/b] in which players planning ahead and puzzling out the most efficient and optimal combinations will be rewarded heavily. This puzzle is one of the more challenging ones I have seen in my boardgaming experience, despite the easy rules. The game is unforgiving to players who fail to plan accordingly, but thanks to its challenging nature, it is really rewarding for those who succeed. The puzzle offers [b]plenty of opportunities for sastifying engine building and strategic planning[/b].

:) The game is [b]modular[/b]: the base game comes with the possibility to include extra action spots, the possibility to play with the same or different research paths for each player, different specialized workers, ... This allows players to somewhat scale the scope and the challenge to their group and increases replay value. However, I do not see a modular combination in which the game is not challenging :)

:soblue: I love the box art and the really cool and original logo's on the cards. However, [b]component-wise this game lacks[/b] a little: the game boards are small and have a prototype look and feel to them. The dozens of different beer tokens for the thousand different beer recipes included in the game are a pain to handle.

:soblue: Due to the challenging nature of the puzzle, the game will face you with, despite its frivolous theme and limited rule set, this is not a game to put on the table with newbies: it is [b]not as accessible[/b] as one would think from looking at it first glance. [b]Analysis paralysis[/b] can be a serious issue: players can get stuck for minutes trying to find their optimal route to greatness (or if things turn bad plain survival ;) ). This is not a game for impatient players.

:soblue: The [b]core mechanics do not offer an intuitive twist[/b]: this is in fact a pure worker placement game with opportunities for rewarding engine building. However, the designer took these mechanics to the maximum and did tie them together masterfully. 

:soblue: The pro of the rewarding puzzle challenge turns to a con for players failing to meet this challenge. [b]The game can be punishing to those making bad strategic decisions, and it offers little to no means of catching up after a really bad start.[/b] Players to handle this challenge inefficiently might feel like the game with its limited actions doesn't offer them a chance to get much done - which is in fact not true: the game only opens itself up to those who have found a path to make the maximum of each action.

:soblue: Mechanically this game is pretty solid, but I can't help but feel that being starting player is a pretty big advantage. Being able to take the first specilized worker is significant, and it costs an opponent one of his precious actions in order to become first player himself. I have yet to gain experience in order to see whether starting player in the first round and the starting player action spot are mechanical flaws or not...

[u]Conclusion:[/u]
You don't need to come here looking for a cool new innovative mechanic, or an easy lighthearted game about small scale brewing. However, if you are looking for a game which will put you through a real challenge of building your own highly efficient engine in an environment with limited resources and actions while keeping a close eye on strategy in order to stick to a long term plan - Brew Crafters is just that! I am honestly impressed by how masterfully known mechanics are combined in this title and how this seemingly 'cute little game' turned out to be a major planning and engine building challenge I will not soon forget! Brew Crafters is a game with character, not because of some new mechanical fling, but due to its appealing theme combined with old and proven game mechanics done right.

[u]Tips:[/u]
(*) Make a long term plan early on in the game: Will you build a firm producing huge amounts of cheap beer (which will earn you serious income, but will require you to invest in serious operational upgrades), or will you stick to a small firm specializing in getting premium beers out as soon as possible? A good start is taking a close look to your research possibilities and plan for them. Obtain certain specialized workers early, so they can aid you to persue a certain strategy.

(*) Plan ahead and time your actions correctly: building a farm in summer is pretty pointless as you can only sow things in spring. How much storage room do you need to store all the ingredients you need to spend during your next brewing phase?  Can you get certain research done before winter so you can get an additional advantage? ...

(*) Interns are really helpful, they are the only way to obtain precious extra brewery actions early on in the game!

(*) For a less restrictive and little more rewarding experience, I recommend playing with some additional actions, included with the base game. The secret recipe brewery action can be a very strong point generator (5 bonus points + a medal worth 3 points because you are (pretty much) guaranteed to be the first to sell that beer accounts to a whopping 8 additional points!)

I love this game. The idea of a everything being setup upfront including the recipes and workers, with no "luck of the draw" component makes this a straight skill of play game. It is a heavy thinking game which I love. The components are great, and though there is a slight confusion on some of the rules those are getting sorted out quickly. This one will be in my collection for a long time.

27-03-2015. According to the reviews, beer-themed Agricola. I have played Agricola and Caverna, and I kind of liked those. In stark contrast, I very much disliked Brew Crafters and I don't understand why yet.

In Brew Crafters you try to brew the most beers over 12 rounds (ie seasons), divided in 3 years. Each season, you can place 2 meeple-workers, or 3 if you have hired interns (pink meeples) which you get in the next consecutive seasons if hired. You can place those workers in the market to get base and luxurious resources, get the first player token, buy more workers for the 2nd part of the game or in order to get more skilled workers (ie. special abilities). I am not sure why anyone would want coffee or fruits in their beers, but apparently here they do. 

You have a different type of worker and board to research, or buy buildings upgrades like bigger production lines and tasting rooms or brew beer. This part is not competitive, everyone can take the same actions on this board. If you take the brew action, you can pay base resources, enhanced with the special ingredients like fruit, coffee beans and flavoring to brew your standard fair and more deluxe beers. The more ingredients and hard to get special stuff you need, the more VPs. If you are the first to brew a beer, you get a bonus for that. Research basically gives more resources, special stuff at the start of winter, VPs for one or the other end-game scoring thing (most different, 1 VP per 2 beers).

I made the classic and obvious mistake of not focusing enough on one path, so I came in dead last and never got my engine to work. Brewing as many beers as the winner, but of less quality so they netted me a fraction of the points they did her. But regardless I felt that this game was INCREDIBLY restrictive and punishing. More so than Agricola. The WP actions you can take are limited, I think there are 8 or 10 or so, if which just several give you base resources, and everyone constantly needs the same things, so competition is quite tense. Everyone needs malts and hops, so everyone constantly takes more malt, more hops.. so if you are third in line and the best hops/malts are gone.. You're basically out of the round..

I feel like this game should be about creating product lines and competing over long term contracts in a shifting market. The way that it actually works doesn't feel very thematically grounded. It's too hard to get basic resources, and you make wildly different amounts of beer based on how many resources you manage to get. The differences in the beer recipes don't seem like they add much to the game, and more thought could have been put into other ways to increase variability in more meaningful ways.

For someone who doesn't really like agricola, I was initially hesitant to back/try Brew Crafters.  I saw it demoed at EQ a few years back, but the comparisons really scared me off.  Not sure what got me back interested in it again, but I got it through trade.  

It's inspired by Agrocola, but there's something about it that really stands out on it's own.  Maybe it's the brewery phase, maybe it's the way workers are handled - but it's just better for me.  The theme for me is what it is.  I'm not a huge beer guy, but I appreciate those people who are beer guys and gals.  

I really like the way the recipes and workers will be different with every play.

Finally, a truly good beer making game! It very much reminds me of Uwe Rosenburg's titles, and while I do prefer those ever-so-slightly over this, it's a well-implemented game with several paths to victory. Improving your brewery is simple, yet since there are so many different ways to do so, it can really impact your strategy. Overall, this is a solid worker placement and resource management game.

This game feels like Agricola with a beer brewing theme.  You would think that would instantly have me enamored with it but I'm only kind of warm right now.

In this game each player has their own personal brewery board and takes 2 main actions each turn to collect resources from a main board, in alternating order with the other players.  I have one big issue with this game right here and that's that almost all the actions are simply taking resources.  In a 3 player game only two of the spaces are not taking resources and those are hiring workers that gives special bonuses or taking one of only two local partnerships that give special bonuses.  This can get a little boring.  It can also lead to wasted actions.  I was in a couple situations where I had no storage left for more resources and there were no useful spaces available.

After the main actions phase there is a brewery actions phase.  This is where you can research, build buildings, or brew beer.  You start with one action but can get a second and third throughout the game.  These vary up the game quite a bit more.  There are several different buildings to get and four different technology trees to research in (and a basic and advanced side).

I want to give this game another chance with some of the advanced rules.  The game we played was with the "first game recommended setup".  The game comes with additional actions you can add during the main action step that might certainly vary the game a bit and make it more engaging and interesting.  Also, the hired workers in the "first game setup" were a little boring and I know there are several others that probably do more interesting things.  It certainly isn't an Agricola replacement.  In fact I'm sure there are a dozen worker placement games I would prefer over this one but with an interesting theme if I could get more mileage out of the advanced rules it is certainly worth keeping around.

I'm really liking this game.  Set up is a bear (having "first brew" tokens for each recipe is just one example where excess could have been trimmed) but game play is excellent.  So far nearly every game has had only about a 6-7 point spread between first and last place!

Brew Crafters is just [i]damn good[/i]. Despite having enough cardboard components to choke a horse, the basic mechanisms of the game are simple to wrap one's head around.  The complicated decision-making come from all of the options the game presents you with. Do you install a Brewpub or an Oak Barrelhouse?  Should you grab those Malt cubes now, or form a partnership with a coffee roaster so you can make advanced beers more easily? Do you research ways to increase your brewing efficiency or methods to increase your yield at the market?

Each game requires a different strategy, because the setup always differs. Which six advanced recipes will be available to brew? Which nine specialty workers can you hire? And that's to say nothing of the extra modules you can throw in--like new market spaces or advanced research tracks. The game is rich with variability even without these modules--but with them, it feels like the box contains a half-dozen mini-expansions!

It's so good. There's a reason I racked up almost ten plays in the first month I owned it.

Fairly average worker placement game that manages to both be derivative and not learn the lessons that it should have learned from better games.  Almost every aspect of the game could have been pared down into a more elegant solution in a similar design.  I just has that bloated feel that seems to permeate the kickstarter scene, demonstrating an amateurism that couches the good ideas in a bunch of extra garbage.

The buildings are the best example of what I am talking about.  They do a bunch of interesting stuff, but they are also horrifyingly text heavy.  A good developer would have chucked the paragraphs of text and wrapped their mechanics into the system in such a way that you could understand what they do at a glance.

The game seemed awfully long for what it is, too, but that just may have been the group.

I love this game. The theme is awesome. The worker placement mechanic expands on what is done with Agricola.
First game felt like just throwing stuff at it to see what would happen was working until time to score up and realized the person had an immensely powerful advancement in their research lab for scoring points. So his "little bit of everything" and no real goal worked really well.

LOVE THIS GAME

Okay worker placement game. It is pretty thematic, but that is also its biggest weakness. There are a lot of fiddly rules and small powers and ways to break rules that it is hard to optimize without having played the game a ton. The fact they have a card you can read just to understand what each building does is kind of silly. Just feels like a novice design overall that wouldn't be good if it wasn't for the thematic connections.

Pretty fantastic for a first play of a game.  Certainly right up my alley in style of game.  We went through a few rough patches in terms of rulebook research and missing a few points of minutiae.  I think the additional complex actions are necessary to mitigate storage issues for ingredients that people may have.  I enjoyed the market and brewery actions being separate and brewery actions being unblockable.  Very solid, looking forward to another play soon.

Brew Crafters is a worker placement game where you're gathering ingredients to make and sell beer. There are three different styles of beers that the world has discovered how to make, and there's three different types within each of those styles. You have to brew the first basic beer of a style before you have the ability to brew the more advanced beers of that style. The game only lasts 12 turns... spring, summer, fall and winter for 3 years.

The game is a worker placement game with accumulating resource spaces. It's a bit odd in that you only have two wooden meeples that can take resources (although apparently in the advanced variant there's a way to get more). After resources are gathered, you move on to phase two where your cardboard worker chits can be placed to do research, buy equipment/upgrade rooms or brew beer. You can get more cardboard workers but you have to have brewed 3 beers to get your second and 9 to get your third. And they have a lot of upkeep cost.

Selling beers gets you points, more for the advanced beers, and two bucks no matter whether you're making a premium beer or a crappy one. Money is really tight in the game. All your cardboard workers and equipment/rooms cost upkeep at the end of winter.

There's also specialists you can hire that give you special powers. And there are some special abilities you can take for free. And research lets you develop special abilities and/or get you end of game scoring.

Outside of theme, there's not much new here. It's a game about converting this to that to points and figuring out the optimization puzzle. It's got a ton of things to think about and it's got fiddly bits all over the place. And this paragraph tells you everything you need to know to decide if you'll like this game or not. If you like the idea of settling in to a new game and learning how to convert brown and yellow cubes, sorry... barley and yeast, into points more effectively than anyone else, then you'll enjoy this game. If this sounds like a slow soul-sucking death then you should avoid this game like the plague.

I've played it 4 times now, and it doesn't get any easier to manipulate the system.  It plays slow, and you've got a lot of repercussions to think about when taking any action or going for any resource.  Planning is essential, and it still can backfire in your face at the end of the year.  It seems to me that the resource market, or the brewery actions, or the ingredients needed for an advanced recipe, something, is just too tight in the game to allow you to build an engine and actually run it well.  And there's part of me that wants to play an additional year, to see where you can go with what you've built, but I am not convinced it would really help.  Next time we will break out the advanced workers and the advanced  lab research and hope it mitigates some of the tightness in the game.  It is a wonderful design, but I wish I could squeeze more out of it.

Not a theme that greatly appeals to me, but the game works well. Has an Agricola/Caverna vibe with enough to set itself apart. One thing I liked was that you actually USED your resources to create something... too many worker placements seem to just be a lot of work for very little output. 

I've played the 2P only so far, but I discussed the game with it's owner and it seems to be similar and works well with 3-4, even though  I didn't try the contribution/project in 2P. I don't think this is the greatest crafting worker placement I've played, but it's quite good and I would play it occasionally, and the theme is a nice change of pace from most games. The theme will particularly appeal to many people as well who into the craft brew scene. (Which I am very much NOT)

This was one of my first games - which is ironic considering it's complexity for a starting-board-gamer.  But as an avid homebrewer and BJCP beer judge, it only made sense to collect this game.  I'm glad I did - the theme is well-integrated, and a lot of the rules and interactions between aspects (market -> brewing -> sales & popularity) really make sense.  Also, the versatility of the game with various market & brewery tiles that can be added to the game to change the way it plays is very enticing for multiple play-throughs, as well as easing new players into the game.
I truly enjoy Brew Crafters, and am looking forward to playing it again and again.

Brew Crafters is a well crafted game, balanced and full of big bold flavor. It's very much Viticulture for the beer tasting crowd. If you like drinking craft beer or home brewing it, buy this. If you couldn't care less, this certainly isn't going to bump any Uwe Rosenbergs off of your play list. That's not necessarily a criticism...it just doesn't do anything new, so there is no need to chase it down unless the theme really sings to you, as it does to me.

Solid euro with a massively variable setup, optional modules, and a wide array of viable win conditions. The research tree allows for vastly different play experiences depending on how you allocate your actions/resources. The game always ends in 3 years (12 turns), but still has enough time to build a complete engine and run it to great effect. On top of all of this it's also highly thematic, especially with the production line moving step by step as you produce more beer. Just a great game.

(Pitched as a somewhat less stressful Agricola, with breweries instead of farms)

This game is incredible. Even from the very first play things just went down so smoothly!

Each player is running their own brewery and taking actions on their turn to collect resources needed for brewing one of the 9 available recipes.

The limited number of workers help turns to go by quickly and the insane amount of brew recipes and special workers make for ridiculous amounts of replayability.

Not really for beginners, but definitely something everyone should try out at least once!

Bought this game at the 2015 UK Games Expo, largely as a result of the glowing reviews. Unfortunately, while a very tightly designed game, it's just a little bit dull and too much like any number of other similar euro-style resource management games. Also - and this is a very minor thing - the names of the beers are rubbish. We bought Viticulture on a whim at the same time and that turned out to be a much better game.

RATING: 9
I was pleasantly surprised at the depth of this game upon my first play, it's definitely a heavy eurogame. It feels quite dense due to the fact that it's all open information, and right from the start you have an astounding number of choices available to you, but only two actions per (Market) round.

The theme of managing a brewery beats being a farmer any day, but I wouldn't exactly call it particularly immersive - it's definitely in the euro camp.

I definitely prefer top-fermenting yeast brews, but as most of the rest of the world loves their lagers, I hope that they'll quickly expand the game with bottom-fermented yeast beers.

Errata: The 2nd edition moves the "Form Local Partnership" from the "Start Player" space to the "Fundraiser" space, where you can now select to "Form Local Partnership," or do a "Fundraiser."

RATING: 7
Brew Crafters is a very nice worker placement game with a resource collection board that is clearly an homage to Agricola. However the combination of special powers that can modify that resource collection and important production actions not being limited by what your opponent's choose makes this game feel much different in execution.  While BC lacks the anguish of Agricola it does have its fair share of tough decisions and is much more accessible.  There was also a lot of love that went into the production for this game with great details in the artwork and components that help bring the theme in the mechanics home.  I do have a love/hate relationship with the six pack tokens as there are so many of them it can make set up and packing up a pain... but the payoff of seeing exactly what you've brewed and bottled is worth it.  Definitely worth a play if you enjoy worker placement... and maybe worth a play if you just like beer.

There is much going on here, and it certainly is a descendant of [thing=31260][/thing]. What it does thematically better than Agricola is non-exclusivity of action spaces that shouldn't be exclusive. (Agricola example: Only one player can bake bread per round? Huh? We both have ovens. What's the problem?) In Brew Crafters, everyone can brew, but snarfing raw materials is exclusive, of course. I can't wait to play this again, and may quickly find it to be a [b][bgcolor=#33cc99] 9 [/bgcolor][/b].

This is a great-looking solitaire print-and-play that I really enjoy. You play members of the Resistance in Nazi-occupied France trying to carry out various missions. Moderately challenging with a good amount of replayability. Yes, once you've worked out the strategy to beat the puzzle, you'll win most times, but I still like it quite a lot.

The best pnp game that I ever played. I find it very thematic and the tension is quite intense (more so after you learned the history of them). Looking at the already-played patrol deck is the most thing that I adore in this game mechanics as it fits in the theme very well.

Initial Impression: This PnP game has blown me away. The artwork is wonderfully produced, simple, yet very functional. The theme is well integrated with the overall gameplay. AI is handled with only minimal procedure, leaving the game feeling uncluttered. Best of all, the game is a real challenge, even at the beginner level. I highly recommend this PnP game.

Print-n-play worker placement game with a WWII theme.  I needed BGG to clarify some of the rules, but once I figured out how to play this little "puzzle" I found it quite enjoyable.  The standard difficulty is pretty challenging, and with 15 combinations of mission cards there is a healthy amount of replayability here.  The patrol "bad guys" can be a little too random at times.  Overall, the theme brings me in, and the mechanics keep me interested.

Played 3 times. Lost the first game on my first turn. Lost the second game a few turns in. Last game I managed to have one guy left near turn 10. No where near the goal. I really like the basic idea of the game. But there's a lot of luck in figuring out where the police go. And there really isn't a way to "come back" from a bad card draw - you might shoot a police to get one of your men back, but then you lose a morale. Or you lose a worker for the rest of the game. Very, very hard to get resources. I like trying to make supply chains to keep you guys safe, but that usually means 1 worker is doing nothing while the second and third get a couple resources. Or you can take a risk and try to get resources with all 3, but that leaves you open to losing them due to the police. I never got anywhere near my goals, I merely avoided losing due to morale loss.

In Maquis, the player is the French Resistance during the Nazi occupation of Paris during WWII. The board is a map of key Paris locations. At the beginning of the game, two random goal cards are placed at connections running off the top of the board. The goal cards define what you need to do to win and will entirely shape your strategy for the game. Maquis is a worker-placement game with a unique spacial aspect. The player starts with 3 workers in a safe house and you must send them out to locations to collect or convert resources to support you in meeting the game's goals. Between each placement, however, police are placed in random, card-drawn locations and they can block your workers' return to the safe house, which eliminates workers from the game permanently. Placement cards have three locations. If all three are occupied, then you go back through the list and if your worker is one of the blockers he is arrested and removed from the game. You can recruit two workers beyond your starting three, but five workers is your limit for the game.

If you have managed to collect some weapons, you can shoot police in your path, but every policeman shot gets replaced by a soldier on future turns who cannot be shot. The heart of the game is about how to chain your workers to effectively protect the paths back and when to take a chance on distributing your workers more broadly. The game's biggest challenge however, might be to keep the Parisian's morale from collapsing. Some actions, the game length, and the introduction of military all reduce morale and it isn't easy to build it back up. If it collapses to zero, you automatically lose. You also lose if you cannot complete your goals in 15 turns or all of your workers are captured.

The need for a safe path to return your workers is the unique twist here and it is a decent one. I've enjoyed my few plays, but I could see it getting repetitive and less interesting pretty quick. We will see.

This game has a very unique worker placement aspect where it is combined with route building, and plays in a very short time. The pseudo-AI is also pretty clever despite the need to do a lot of card counting. There is definitely tactics on where you place your units, sometimes even on empty spaces to build a route for a unit that needs to get to a far-flung location, and some strategic planning of when and what to build your safe houses.  However, it is hindered by its poorly written rulebook, and the over dependence on needing to get to the airdrop spaces to get your "engine" going. For a PNP game this is alright, but if it were to be published I hope that there are more viable options you can take in the early game.

[u]21-Jan-2014[/u]: This was the big winner of the [thread=1002891][/thread].  It's a solitaire worker placement game where you control a band of resistance fighters during Nazi-occupied France.  You  must complete two random missions chosen at the start of each game via resources management and even some combat against the corrupt local police.

If you are a solo gamer and enjoy a good worker placement game, this one is a no brainer.  Highly thematic, challenging, plenty of replay value with several potential goals, and a simple but effective AI system.  Oh, and the map art ranks up there with almost any published game.  Just excellent all around.

Even though my plays have all been about 20 minutes, this is a good way to lose a couple hours without even realizing it. I can feel the pressure of the game ramping up as play progresses and shooting my enemies carries such strong repercussions that I am often willing to suffer an arrest early on to avoid facing soldiers until the game is fully underway.

A solid and innovative game that is starting to really grow on me after a few quite frustrating early games where I had both misunderstood key rules and also key strategies. Thankfully there is an excellent community around this game and I was both enlightened and encouraged by the answers I got at BGG.

On my fifth game it is starting to click for me and I enjoy the way there are clearly times to proceed cautiously and then an opportunity to take more a risk presents itself, usually with quite favourable odds if you have been paying attention to the patrol cards.

I have only played halfthe missions - some do seem a bit harder than others. Maybe they could have been ranked? Or a suggested easy start set of missions?

Update - after a few more plays I would add that making a good start is essential. I find the planning needed for the opening is sometimes more than I am really in the mood for. Which will probably mean I either crack it out less or abandon and  restart games when I get screwed over by a difficult sequence of patrol cards or muck up my planning. For me this is a hard solitaire with not much room for error or surviving when calculated risks don't pay off.

Solo game with a nice theme that can be also played with two players. Usually I don't enjoy card counting that much but in here it takes the game to almost like a deduction game when you are calculating risks and rewards where the patrols can't or probably won't come which forces to make tough decisions. Usually my risks don't pay off! ;)

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
[thing=148729][/thing] is a solitaire work placement, set in WWII - the player represents the Resistance, the Maquisards (hence the name of the game). The goal is to fulfill two objectives in 14 rounds. To do this, the player uses her agents to use the locations in France in order to gain the necessary items and information in order to achieve the goals. The game is lost if the player loses all her agents, the Morale of the citizens drop to zero, or if the time ends (going to the 15th round) without an objective being done. There are the possibility of a draw, if any of the losing conditions happen, but the player managed to complete one of the goals.

The mechanics for [thing=148729][/thing] are easy to understand, yet the game is challenging, managing to have a nice scale in difficulty, as harder missions can be attempted. Set up and tear down are minimal, and with a playing time of around 15 to 20 minutes, many plays can happen in just a couple of hours - which is rather good, since it matches well with the difficulty and the luck in placement of guards/soldiers, as usually these can be avoid with a chain of agents, yet, every now and then, a game can be lost due to bad luck, with them closing completely the access of the agents to the Safe House (at the end of the each round, the agents must return to the Safe House, otherwise they are arrested).

The game is quite pretty, but being a PnP, the components quality may vary a lot.

Overall, [thing=148729][/thing] is a neat solo game - it offers challenge, decisions and scales in difficulty (a much needed feature many solo games lack), while having smooth mechanics and gameplay, all wrap up inside a 20 minutes playing time. Recommended.

WOW!  Amazing print and play.  Gorgeous art in both the original and secondary versions.  Cool, simple worker placement mechanics that fit the wonderful historical theme.  A rare single player of medium weight with a lot of depth.  My only two concerns are 1) it's not actually a purchasable product and b) it's very possible to get mauled by the Wehrmacht even when you've planned and placed "perfectly".  I'd really like a one- or two- shot mechanism to evade or destroy nazis to minimize the perfect-play-leads-to-failure nature of the "three times down the location list" mechanism.  In my most recent game, I was able to experience perfect play by maintaining only three workers throughout.  Gave to Mom

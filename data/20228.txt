{1 play %u2022 4 player} I give it a 6 because it all works, and I [i]want[/i] to like it, but I think rating will drop with subsequent play.  For one thing, the elections never felt that meaningful - partly because the game held true to its hour playing time (not necessarily a bad thing), but mostly because the islands have such limited space for placement, we almost NEVER had more than two players on any one island... so there really wasn't any diplomacy or alliances - the election results were all givens.  Worse still is that the reward for just exploring new land seems too good to pass up.  And though it didn't come up in our game, I've now read that many feel this is, in fact, true... and unbalanced - that an exploration "strategy" seems dominating.  Which is too bad, 'cause I really like how actions are selected - advantage for choosing an action first, payment for choosing an action last, possibly not having a specific action available - and, if you think about, it's kind of Caylus-lite in that you have an idea of which actions you'd like, but you're not necessarily sure what the best order for choosing them will be.  Maybe some variants will help, assuming this ever hits the table again.

This is a game that can't decide if it is a very good game or a problematic game.  On the good side, it has excellent components and a strategic feel.  On the bad side, it can be a bit fiddly.  The rules point out that the game will often end sooner than expected and this is very likely true.  In a 4+ game it is entirely possible that there will be players that you have not interacted with at all.  This is a source of the problematic nature.  Overall, the game is solid and highly playable.  [GTI Code: TPSD]

First Play: Played with 6 players and this was a big mistake. Mindful that you get two turns a round, with six players when you are player #1, after your second turn you will wait 11 turns to make your next turn. The down time is vast. There is no point pre-planning what you will do because the chances are the board will be different and you can only guess what options are available to you.

Yes there is a game there but it reminded me too much of Tikal. This game probably shines with 3 or four players tops but with six this is an absolute stinker.

rating after one play with four players. Funny one this. Lots of interesting stuff and felt quite weighty, but then it finished just as it was about to get going. nice theme, striaghtforward rules and definitely want to give it a few more tries though and rating may well rise. Will be interesting to see if the action cards in the expansion makes much difference (if they do I will be a bit miffed they weren't included in the base game, particularly since base game + expansion seemed to be released simultaneously.)

RATING: 6
One game.  I was disappointed that it ended before there was much player interaction: four players where no tile had more than two different colors on each of them.  Of course that might have been because we were all relatively new to the game.  However, I did like the alternate feel the game gave to area influence

Once when I was in Hawaii, on the island of Kauai, I met a mysterious old stranger. He said he was about to die and wanted to tell someone about the treasure. I said, "Okay, as long as it's not a long story. Some of us have a plane to catch, you know." He stared telling his story, about the treasure and his life and all, and I thought: "This story isn't too long." But then, he kept going, and I started thinking, "Uh-oh, this story is getting long." But then the story was over, and I said to myself: "You know, that story wasn't too long after all." I forget what the story was about, but there was a good movie on the plane. It was a little long, though.

Initial rating (6) based on one play with some unenthusiastic players and the standard rules.  Rating upped to a 7.5 after second playing with fans of the game AND a house rule that all 12 rounds are played regardless of tile exploration (i.e. the game doesn't end when the last tile is discovered).

RATING: 7
This rating might be a little bit off because I haven't played the original game with the appropriate scale (we played a 5 player game without the cards which made actions artificially tight) but I still think I have a good enough grip on what the game is about to rate it.

Big Kini is a neat little exploration and limited action game by my most hated game seller, Playme.de. Despite my gripes in regards to their epically shoddy customer service, Playme has managed to find a nice game to publish for their first time out. In Big Kini players are trying to gain as many VPs as possible by having control of islands and by exploring the nearby areas. Each hexagonal tile depicts 3 islands with various actions associated with them. Some have tobacco production plants, which make money. Some have seashells, which strangely can come into play in elections or can be collected for end game points. Some have spots for new islanders to be born onto and others have ports, which allow exploration. Each round each player gets 2 actions from the menu of (Babies, Explore, Election, Collect Shells, Move Guys, Take Money). The first player to pick a given action gets to do the action twice while the third person in has to pay money to use it. I like this system and it seemed like a neat way of doing things...sort of like Tempus's action selection, but with interaction.

The game seems pretty well balanced...exploring too much seems an ineffective path to VPs because exploring generally leaves the other players with plenty of good places to take over and politically controlling islands is the most lucrative source of points...though it is also time intensive, which balances it out. 

I quite liked my first game and I would like to try this again.

One of the best games of the Essen 2005 fair. Nice theme and as deep as you want it to be without overwhelmingly complicated rules. Much could be said about the influence of seating order, and in a peaceful round parts of it might seem like a solitaire game (as is Settlers of Catan), but the game plays much quicker than many of it's relatives. Recommended for gamers and wannabe gamers alike.

Big Kini is one of the better short, small area control games. Comparable to Louis XIV in weight and game lenght.  I really like the theme of this game! It's light and fits with the play - however, it conceals a fairly cut-throat medium-weight area-control game that can be quite "thinky". However, because there are only 2 action choices each turn it moves along at a nice clip.  With the addition of the "expert" rules which are available for download and the necessary expansion, the game improves to an "8". 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fun and quick, a game that everyone enjoyed but no one went crazy over. Typical comment was "it's good, but not different enough from other games that I'd rather play". It was compared to Settlers a lot, though it's more a vague resemblance than any sort of direct equivalence. I liked it and will play it again, but I don't see it becoming a mainstay in the group. Played with 5 (using the expansion but no action cards), worked fine.

After 2 games I'm still unsure about the long term viability of this, but have enjoyed the first games.  I don't think discovery by itself is the be-all, but we do play one more round afte the last island is discovered to extend the game a little.

Rating after four plays: 5 6 players (with 6 player & Action Card Expansion) Rating may change after more plays.
The cards add some tactical depth to the game. Nothing really new in this game but a good mix with many ways leading to victory. Some issues with usability (graphics make you loose track, some chips are really tiny, Player aid shows victory points but should also show costs for actions).
While 5 player is still OK, the game with max. # of player became too slow moving with too few viable options left for later players.

Really fun game with an interesting theme, some of which I've sorta seen before. This game has lot of tension and some interesting mechanisms that really level the playing field in terms of initial benefits of from placements. The tough decision is often should I take a double benefit action to take it from an opponent that will really reap the rewards from it or should I take something that might help me more this round. It's very well done. Would like to get the expansion and see what the action cards do.

I see the charm here, but the game didn't really hook me.  Things get off to a slow start, and while the last islands were revealed on the last round, it still seemed that we were finishing too early.  The voting mechanism never had a chance to become an integral part of the game.

Decent game.  Went quick, had some interesting choices to make along the way.  I would tell other people to try it out.  Do not play with the expansion unless you want an entirely different game.

Given some mixed reviews I didn't know what to expect.  But this is a fun game, with relatively little luck.  I agree that maybe the game should go a couple more rounds for the elections to come into play more... we didn't have any competition in any of our elections as the game ended right before we probably would have.

This has the bonus that my wife likes it a lot. The theme would have been better if they left it in space but it's decent the way it is.  We play with the Discovery action worth 7 as in the downloaded rules for expert players and use one of the setups in that file.  Money is tighter that way and we think it's a better game.  In some ways I think of this as Tempus light though I haven't tried the action cards in the expansion yet.

Picked up at Essen 2005. Played once. We were aware of the 'issues', so removed the game ending condition of exploring the last atoll and played the full 12 rounds. Still, it felt like the game was too short and ended just as it started to get interesting. Perhaps playing 24 rounds would solve the issue - I would still play again as it was an enjoyable experience.

Movement from island to island reminded me of Tongiaki.   Area-control issue involving elections is somewhat like a more complex Tongiaki.

The existence of many possible activities, many of which result in benefits to you, but that do not directly go toward winning the game is like Puerto Rico.
Similar complexity level to Puerto Rico, this is a little less complex (no buildingw w/ different abilities).

I guess I like this better than both Tongiaki and Puerto Rico, though neither of those two are especially favorites.

I'd play this again, at least twice.

2 plays.  A good, area control-esque game.  Good - not great.  I played 4p games back to back, and in both games, it seemed like one of the players was just out of the game from the beginning.  Not sure if that's going to be a continuing problem or not.  I did not find that the game ended early, though, as some have suggested.  Seemed the length was just right.  Quick tip - it's almost always cheaper to not fight somebody for control of an atoll, and just move elsewhere.

An area influence game where certain locations are worth more points that others but there are multiple paths to scoring.  Both times, I played this was with the 5-6 Plyr expansion (which I've heard is the best/ideal way).  Once I played with the cards and once without cards (to cut learning curve for others) and both games were interesting and very enjoyable.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Solid game which gives you choices in what actions you want to pursue in a turn from 6 different actions.  The first player to choose an action gets to do it twice, the second player gets to do it once, and the from then on there is a monetary charge to do it a third or fourth time.  Better with 4-6 players as more conflict ensues.  Where you place your people will determine what type of actions they can complete and each of the different positions grants differing amounts of victory points and action options.  I enjoy playing with the expansion and the cards; however, it would likely be wise to not allow one person to dominate in cardplay as they grant free actions to that player.  While I rate the base game around a 7, I enjoy the cards and rate gameplay and 8 with the cards.  However, the cards do add a bit of chaos and disorder to an otherwise straightforward system so choose according to your tastes.

Based on one 4 player game. This game seems to have an early exploration end problem which lets the player doing the most exploration win early before the others can make enough of the other victory points.

Competitive exploration, area control, action-point game that probably doesn't get the fanfare it deserves.  OK, so it doesn't really bring much new to the table but it's a good combination of mechanisms that work.  The islands also have mayors (which score well) and they can be overthrown by holding an election (votes from your pieces (citizens) on the island can be increased with goods you've collected).

Dommage qu'un petit quelque chose cloche avec ce jeu. Il n'est certe pas un jeu qui se taillera une place de choix dans ma collection; mais pourtant, on ne peut pas dire que ce fut si désagréable!

Il est peut-être préférable d'augmenter à 7$ le coût des découvertes d'iles (plutôt qu'à 5$).

First play with 3 which was an interesting exercise of sequencing your limited actions in order to advance your vp holdings. First to pick the action in a round gets a repeat action (where have I seen that before), such as putting 2 cubes (babies) on tiles which have multiple functions, with your placed cubes giving you certain abilities. Can't help thinking this is Puerto Rico inspired, but at least this is a textless, interactive,shorter and spatial sequencing experience. (Also a medieval theme came to mind re: the gameplay, rather than an Atoll way of life). Gameplay is fragile to kingmaking (personalities). Three players feels unsatisfactory, whereas with 4 will provide more placement competition and make elections interesting.

6 rating for one 3-player game (full 12 turns, 7 cost to discover tiles). Probably a 5 with 2-players and perhaps a 7 with 4. This 3-player game had an early 2 on 1 situation as I explored first and the other 2, both with a 3-tile movement range, immediately started competing with me for resources on both my home and new tiles. This was equivalent to me bringing 'a knife to a gunfight' because my range was only 2-tiles and I couldn't respond to this 'poaching' in kind. I think this naturally unbalances the game with an odd number of players. For this reason, the player with the 2-tile range should never be the first to do a discovery of a new tile. Also, I think strategy should totally revolve around, and be flexible towards, playing at least one 2x action every turn. Anything less is a waste of opportunities that will cost the game. Lastly, the game ended significantly before there was any real competition for the central tiles. I'm not sure all were ever even inhabited, several were only taken in the final 2 turns. Might be worth a replay with 4-players. (I agree with several comments that the game should either be 18 turns or 3 actions per turn).

RATING: 6.5
Based on two games, both of which ended halfway through due to some rather aggressive exploration.  The aggressive explorers won, but whether that was due to a bit of luck or the dominance of that strategy time will tell.

I'd like to rate the game an "8", because it is well-presented, and offers players some interesting choices.  But those choices may be entirely illusory, if there is one dominant strategy.  Re-rated to 6.5 now, as others are reporting the same concerns about one dominant strategy and the game finishing too early.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Interesting, original game, but flawed (unbalanced) design. It harshly penalizes the players who go near to last in the early rounds, and since it's a game of position, where the rich get richer, they are playing a game of catch up the rest of the game. That's a big flaw, and one which gets in the way of an otherwise-creative design. It's also not good for a first play because of the disparate mechanics which take a LONG time to coalesce into a cohesive whole. Takes a bit long for what it is. After reading the forum threads here, it looks like the rules are not only unclear and unsupported, but they are not working - people don't know if the exploration phase allows you a free movement (and apparently the designer taught it as free movement). But combine that, with the luck of whatever tiles are dealt right next to you, and the game would become ridiculously dependant on sheer chance. BGG doesn't even know if it takes 2 different color people on an island for a vote, or 2 of the same. (!) Also, it is broken for 5 players (see my analysis in the expansion game entry)

Picked up in Essen 2005. Based on the first game only. It plays fast & furious. There are so many things to do and so little actions for doing it! At the end of the game there were issues if the "aggressive colonization" strategy may be dominant. Need more plays.
Second game. Still very funny.

RATING: 7
Rating after one three-player game.  I thought the "2 actions per turn" limit, coupled with the "double action / single action / pay $2 for one action" system constrained things just enough to make them interesting.  There are some graphical faux pas, but nothing too terrible.  I'm anxious to play again with four, which I think will be a better number -- our first game didn't have enough contested elections in my opinion.

UPDATE: After a second playing, I have to find out what other people do to mitigate a bad starting layout, especially where more settlements are on one side of the board than the other.

Much better as a four player game without the cards expansion - it's faster, less down time and the game mechanism remains simple and fluid. I like the game for the choices and the fact that it's not a brain burner, but engaging never-the-less. There's a whole lot of options available to the players, with no one particular one that's really going to make or break your game. In this way it's a nice light game where the confrontation (while keeping it interesting), isn't such a big deal for the player who loses the election. If you want a game with more interaction that'll last a few rounds longer you can play with the variant that settlers/babies can't be used to explore. (ie. only a cube in one of the three offices can be used to explore.) Don't overlook that only tiles with two different PLAYERS can hold an election. I've found the game can be good or bad depending upon the amount of interaction. Games where players tend to do lots of exploring are the boring ones - that's why I recommend the variant above.

Tentative rating after 2 plays.

Neat little area influence game that plays quickly. Players are trying to control different pacific islands. There are ways to score VPs (money, area/character control, collecting sets of goods, exploration).

There is also a small negotiation and voting aspect for the role of Bay Baron (which allows player access to all aspect of an island: income, settling, goods production, etc).

Good fun with some agonising decisions in a smart middle weight package.

This rating is based solely on the official fixes (8 to explore and 12 game turns regardless of exploration).  I can see how the original rules would cause the game to fall apart, I think that the patch works.  Clearly, in the race to Essen, Big Kini lost.  I'm glad that everything is straightened out now.

When I started playing this I was convinced that whoever discovered the best tiles in the begining was going to win.  But players who come to terms with the multiple paths to victory will discover that this can help you get on to other long term strategies sooner.  If anything I question whether the game is too balanced.

Thematically this is fun, and I like the way that the system works.  It seems intuitive to me as it is somewhat familiar, but at the same time it doesn't mirror any other games out there. It deserves a place in my collection.

Not quite the "ultimate" cube management game (that would be Byzantium) but it is certainly up there.  I'm looking forward to trying the expansion.

Needs a rule tweak or two to make for a good game. Big Kini is no Big Deal just a Mini Kini!

Played for the first time last night and was impressed w. this middle-weight game. Used the basic rules w. four people and the game ended in round 10 when all the islands were discovered. My one complaint is that it felt like the game had just gotten going and then all of a sudden ended. Perhaps a repeat play w. the Advanced Actions Cards from the Expansion Set will help that in the future.

It's an exploration, area-control game: the board is built of hexes arranged in a pattern according to the #players, with all tiles face-down except each player's starting area. Each tile is an atoll consisting of 3 islands with various configurations of tobacco plants (source of money), settlement areas (where you breed to bring new pieces into play), harbors (the type of which affects your ability to explore), and goods (3 types). Control of these islands is determined by where you place your tokens. On your turn, you can move tokens around, explore, try to take control over various areas, etc. You get victory points based on goods you have, certain positions are worth more VP, etc. We played with the card expansion, which adds another type of action available to players.

It's a nice game, but I don't see what all the fuss was about (and that's not just because my wife won!)? I guess it is a good, fast exploration game; although really it seemed to end too abruptly (by having explored all tiles), just when things were just getting interesting.

BestWith:5,6? [Exploration, Tile Laying, Economic] Need to play again before trading away.

Several quick fixes: Exploring costs 7 gold, or
Game ends 2 turns after the last island has been explored or on the 12th turn, whichever comes first.

As others have noted, the game seems to end just as things get started, but I enjoyed playing it and I am looking forward to more plays. I also didn't get a chance to play with the expansion, so I understand the action cards add more choices to the game. Fun, building and exploration game.

Played 3+ times.  Very good game.  Lots of tension as you only have 24 actions.  Lots of player interaction as you fight for control of different islands.  I really like the action selection mechanism.  I highly recommend the so called "expert rules" posted on the web ($7 to explore and all 12 turns). 2006/07/31 Expansion Owned.

Based on a second play, this time with all the right rules. No change, still an okay 6.5. Quite luck heavy. Needs work to see further play. Expansion may help. Third play, downgrade. Enjoyment nosedived. No real desire to play again, and it has a problem on the set collecting avenue to victory (the one I choose, needless to say).

This game just fell flat for me. It needs a bunch of house rules to be interesting. 

Pretty game though. I prefer atolls over any medieval city theme.

[Basic game] I played the game and couldn't really see some of the problems that people were complaining about. On our first game played out 12 turns, but the last tile was turned over on the 11th turn. If we were playing that way, then it would have ended just one turn sooner. From our game is felt like there were different strategies. One guy collected money and then discovered a lot. Another guy tried collecting goods. Others were trying to get people in positions of power.

I'm rating the base game as a 6, but would give Big Kini a 7 when played with the expansion. The addition of the action cards in the expansion definitely improves the game. Big Kini reportedly began life as a space exploration and colonization game before the publisher changed the theme. The change is fortuitous in one sense - the graphics and landing spots on the tiles in Big Kini are pretty small, so the bright, cartoonish, pastel-colored graphics the island theme uses do help spots stand out. Other than that, I think the theme detracts a bit - a space exploration theme would have fit the mechanics far better. There's quite a bit to like here, though, including how quickly the game plays and the difficult choices players must make because of the very limited number of actions each turn. Overall, this is a borderline keeper for me. I enjoy Big Kini and it'll stay in my collection for now, but it's one of those games that will probably bet played very infrequently.

Only played once and would like to play again.  Game felt way too short in my 3 player game.  We didn't even get all the tiles explored.  Seems having another action or two each turn would help.  However, it seems that this game might just be who can 1) get the most players on board and 2) who moves them to the best spots.  The exploration and set collecting didn't seem to be vialable strategies to counter someone being all over the board, but again I only played once.

Just reading the rules did not give me a good idea of what the game would be like.  The rules are pretty badly organized, but it was more than that.  I just see how things fit together until we started playing.

We played a 5 player game, but since it was our first time, I left the action cards of the expansion out of it.  That made the competition for the actions more extreme that I think it normally would be.  Still, that competition is part of what made it fun and while this many players is probably more chaotic than some would like, I enjoyed it.  I imagine that adding the action cards help, since that adds a consolation action that you can take when someone else gets what you really wanted.

Being too lazy to write my own description for this game, I'm copying Larry Chongs: "An area influence game where certain locations are worth more points that others but there are multiple paths to scoring."  This was my month for getting area control games and this is a solid one.

Needs houserules!!!!

Played it once... Really bad!! There is something very wrong with this game!!
I think 3 options could be used to improve the game play: or remove several tiles (4 to 6) so that contact must be made between several players or add extra turns which should be played (18 instead of 12?) or make it easier to take over islands so it is encouraged more to try this...

We played the game with 5 players, the expansion, the cards, and the expert rules.  The best I can say is that this one is an 'ok' game.  The bits are small, the rules are really confusing, there isn't enough meat to merit the time it took, and there wasn't enough 'fun' for the apparent lightness of the game.  I'll be honest, I might have been biased by the time I played it, as I was the one that struggled through the rules trying to understand them.  So, I was a bit frustrated with the game before I even got started playing.

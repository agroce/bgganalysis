Nice production.  Nice introduction to deduction games, with no memory requirement.

Without the expert rules, I feel that if everyone is paying attention, the winner is likely to be decided simply by play-position, and luck of the draw.  A round doesn't last long enough for less-obvious deductions to have a bearing.

Homemade version.
Scratches a light deduction itch and plays very quickly.

An interesting deduction puzzle a la Clue, but which gets to the point. It's just enough for my tastes. Because it takes your turn to Accuse, there is also that need to get a feel for where other players are, because sometimes you need to take a guess when you know who won'T get another turn.

Playing with 2 or 3, however, will lead to some boring shuffles, but these are usually over with quickly.

I didn't buy it at spiel because the guy who explained it to me said that it is like cluedo but faster. This is true but the feeling is different. Fast and easy deduction game.

Deduction game similar to Sleuth. Much quicker, which makes it more acceptable than Sleuth.

Deduction game that you can guess at without actual deduction. Meh.

Un jeu de déduction vraiment très simple, et particulièrement prenant.
Il reprend la mécanique ultra connue de quête d'indices du Cluedo, mais avec une dynamique super bien fichue pour des parties qui durent moins d'un quart d'heure. Formidable !!!!

A fast-paced deduction game which takes very little place to play (you could play it while standing in the subway).

Nice little filler.

Not worth playing at all without the expert rules because the game can be over after the first round. Somewhat interesting when using the expert rules but those come at a high risk of accidentally giving incorrect answers.

5 mn to explain

Flavor of Love Letter / Coup for the kind of game : few cards but a very good idea behind that set of cards.

No chaos

If you love deduction game, you will love this one for sure.

Holmes 13 might be the fastest deduction game I've ever played. Essentially this is much like Sleuth, but here you have freedom to ask anything, but receive either a confirmation that each player has *some* of that type, or a number from one specific player.

Oddly, though I've always been annoyed by the restrictions imposed by the cards in Sleuth and other deduction games I can see now why they exist. The complete freedom means both that the game is over in 5 minutes and that everyone seems to work it out on the same turn.

Holmes 13 was fun and I nearly picked it up, but I don't think I'd rush to play it frequently.

An excellent version of Cluedo without the board slowing the pace of the game. Much improved once we started playing it correctly and only allowing one of the three actions each turn rather than all three in sequence. Occasionally one player is very lucky and can get a quick win, but if this happens just play again.

Fantastic deduction game, I adore it to bits. I had heard reviewers say that one drawback of the base game is that most players come to the conclusion at the same time, but I see that as a feature, and not a bug. It raises the tension, and means that you may want to guess sooner, in order to try to steal the victory. That said, I'll still give the expert rules a try at some time, but it seems so easy to get something wrong by mistake then, which would ruin the game for everyone.

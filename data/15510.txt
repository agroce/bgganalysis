RATING: 6
See Palazzo - Well produced, attractive, the mechanics fit together smoothly, the scoring system is clever and seems well balanced, it plays quite quickly and is likely to provide a tense finish. However, there are dozens of games like this now and it doesn't differentiate itself from any of them. Dull.

RATING: 7
A very subtle game that plays well with 3-5 players.  Gameplay seems relatively straightforward, but there are alot of subtle strategies.  As with any card game, luck of the draw can be a factor.  Very interesting/unique idea is the co-operative/competitive aspect of offering cards to "help build" a wonder, where you either get points for a refused offer, or builders to help you score for the area control majority.  Seems to be an overlooked 2005 title.

RATING: 6
I was rather shocked by how brilliant this game is. It's a game where players get points for helping each other. To win you have to help just the right amount. Finding that balance is really hard and requires getting to know your opponents' needs.

Avoid the power cards. They turn the game into a power card hunt and shatter the compelling nature of the core game.

My first playing of Tower of Babel was a remarkable success... I got that tense feeling which is so elusive for me. This game is fantastic for a number of reasons. It offers a surprising amount of depth for such a simple set of rules. The game is easy for people to learn, and offers the same kind of experience that Web of Power/China does: a game that feels involved and interesting while playing in a short amount of time. We played without the special cards, and with our discs as open information. I feel these changes all increase the enjoyment factor of this game. I'm looking forward to repeat plays of this one.

Excellent medium-weight Euro with constant player interaction.  The bidding mechanism is engaging with many ramifications.  No downtime, multiple paths to victory, and just the right mix of startegy make this a must-own.  Its short length makes it suitable for a filler or a family game.

RATING: 5
1st play: There's a reason the 8th wonder was never built - it was boring.  I didn't actually hate the game, but there's a lot of random in the card draw.  It's interesting to play older games as long as you don't pay too much for them, and I didn't.  There's nothing inspiring or memorable in this, standard euro mechanics with no theme from Knizia.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A solid, elegant euro from the master Reiner Knizia, Tower of Babel is not my favorite from him, but I definitely would play it again. I was told after we played, that Rio Grande Games put a mechanism of some stupid cards in this game that just destroyed the elegance and balance of this game, what a shame of this practice.

RATING: 6
A bit of a learning curve to this game. The first time round I had no understanding of what I was trying to do. By the second game it was starting to make some sense.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
In this game, players tried to build the 7 wonders in the world with resource cards that acquire from a deck of cards and of course with the help of one another.  Players have a few actions to choose from per round.  To get resources or to build offer to build a part of a wonder.  

If players choose to build a wonder, all other players can secretly offer to help to build the wonder.  After the cards are revealed, the player who initiated the build can choose any number of players for help.  The initiator will get to receive the resource chip.  If players collects resources of similar kind, victory points will be awarded at the end of the game.

When players finished building a wonder, players will calculate how many components of the wonder they have built.  If they are one of the highest contribution to building the wonder, they will be awarded with more victory points.

Good points: The game is quite easily played though the game is quite abstract.

Bad points: The trader cards in the game is hardly accepted by players at all.  The game can easily go well without the trader cards as players could really see no reason to forgo the resource chip to another player.

Rating may rise, as I have not played it with only 3 yet. Will probably hold off playing with the split disks until there is a group with everyone having experience. 

Have bumped my rating (again) based on 3 players. Currently my favorite for that number.

This is a subtle game with every decision having multiple consequences. RK has once again taken a simple game that just has numbers, and has produced a gem.

Docked one point for rules organization. 
Yes that means it is an 11.

the board isn't a looker, and the action cards are downright unbalanced.  like the middleweight game length/feel.  on the action cards, another comment claims knizia said they weren't his design and that he suggests playing without them.  i've played twice without and i like it better.  not so hot with 3, decent with 5.  seems best with 4.  it feels unique for a euro.  i'm still uncertain on strategy and the degree to which card draws determine it.  ultimately lacking a certain fun factor for me.  i think if everyone approached it in a calculational way i'd actually enjoy it more.  really wish there was a version with a personally appealing theme.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Not bad.  It was more interesting as I figured out what was going on.  It has the standard Knizia wonky scoring, and it's quick.  My biggest complaint - the turn order track is useless and confusing.   would recommend not using it, just keep track of whose turn it is.  The columns are not necessary either, but they're at least unique.

Well, I've only played it twice, but it was pretty fun.  There is some deep strategy going on with the bidding and the trade card.  The blue cards seemed to be a little wild in terms of usefulness.

The simple components and rules, the innovative "offer" mechanic and the balance in the scoring make for an intriguing game. Unfortunately, it doesn't culminate in anything particularly fun for me. While it it is perhaps a good exercise in optimization, the repetitivenes of play, the barebones theme and the lack of story arc (as Stephen Glenn put it) ultimately just make the gaming experience too bland to rate any higher.

Excelllent new game from Rainer Knizia. Not sure how he does it, after all, it's just another area control/set collection game with an auction mechanism and various ways to score points - all things he has done before a countless number of times (although I am sure there is a list here where someone has counted!) - but it all hangs together well and feels different enough to sit alongside his other stuff. Moves along at a good pace and easy to teach too. Not particularly weighty and not one to leave a massively lasting impression perhaps, but a great opener - the role I am rating it for.

RATING: 7
Game mixing area control, set collection and an original trade system. It has high interaction. Simple rules, and moderate time lenght. 5 players will end a game under an hour. The system is clever and has a lot of subtlety. The scoring seems well balanced and offers at least three extreme strategies plus the balanced one. So far I have some doubts about the convenience in pass action. It seem to me underpowered. Need more game experience about this.
Cards are small and not of high quality. That is my main critic about quality. I can understand colour choice that seems odd (mainly light grey, dark grey, light brown and violet) but gives an ancient feeling and let players pieces (in bright colours) stand out on the board.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
- Maximum offer may equal total on disc. Trader is not counted in this number. The number on the disc is the maximum number of build cards that may be offered.

- We don't use the special cards. (knizia variant)

A slight twist on the usual Knizia auction mechanics has players sort of cooperating in order to build the ancient wonders of the world. After a few plays I had sort of decided that the game was unremarkable, although definitely containing a decent amount of decisions to be made the game sort of lacked tension and drama. A few plays after these I've sort of taken a liking to the relaxed nature of the game, the interesting hand management and bid-like mechanics of the cardplay. It's also a fairly unique pairing to have a stripped down almost El Grande-esque area majority mechanic paired with the bidding mechanic. That's a pairing I really enjoy and would like to see used together more often.

The central bidding mechanic is a clever one. It makes for tough choices and fun moments. But unfortunately it is the only part of the game that rises above mediocrity. The rest of the game is bland and unoriginal. The bidding mechanic isn't strong enough to carry the whole game. Add to that that this is another Knizia with a spray painted meaningless theme and you quickly have to come to the conclusion that this is another miss by the doctor.

Doesn't work with 3 players. With fewer hands of cards to work with, building fails more often, which is no fun. Never played with 4, but 5 works great. Not one I want to play often, but now and then I get a craving for it. There are so many ways to get points, it's hard to know what the right move is sometimes. Definitely keeps you thinking. A quick but deep game.

I've never tried it without the special cards, but I'd like to, since people who really like it say it's better without them.

Very unique area control/auction game mix.  It's super quick but with alot of choices to make.  Even if you don't get picked in the building of the wonder you score, which opens up more on how, when and why you bid.

Update: Dropped it down a rank after many more plays.  Tower of Babel suffers from repetitiveness despite it's shortish duration.  It really needs one more main system to elevate the very clever basic offering mechanic.  As it stands you are just continually evaluating the tradeoff of disks and monuments which is fairly easy, especially once you take into the account the severe limitations of your hand.  I would really like to see another attempt at an offering game that takes full advantage of the many subtleties hinted at in this game.  Lastly, this seems like a three player only game, otherwise too many cards come out which dilutes the proceedings.



The relative simplicity belies its depth.  Five players does not work too well, but three and four players are equally excellent.  The many methods of scoring rank this as the top "offering" style game I have played.

Play with the "Knizia variant", the way the designer intended it to be played, with no bonus cards.  It keeps makes for a much tighter and less random game.  With the bonus cards this is, maybe, a "6".

Tower of Babel seems to be another game that plays better with fewer - I vastly prefer this with 3 players to games with 4 or 5.  That said, it's more of a pure Eurogame and, as such, lacks a bit in the Excitement Department.

A nice game, turns go by very quickly, which I like. And you're constantly required to think, even when it's not your turn, as there are many ways to earn points.

Rating might alter as I play more. Inital impression is this is 'okay', feels a bit like Amun-Re lite - not sure why there are special power cards, certainly some seem a bit better than others, a fixed bonus for finishing a wonder might have been better. Game end seems a round too soon, but that feeling might fade as I play it more. Not sure I like it enough to want to purchase it, but would consider trading.

This is very much a thinker's game.  Every round you need to make several choices between options.  The problem is that it is very difficult in the early going to compare the options.  By the time you get to the mid-game, you may be out of it because you didn't evaluate your early game options properly.  

Played once with 4.  It was a miserable experience, partly due to the players, and partly due to the game.  Evaluating the usefulness of actions is not intuitive at all.  Players complained they didn't know what they were doing, then acted randomly, and complained that they weren't doing well.  A quick strategy overview before playing with newbies is highly recommended.  

Sold.

I really like ToB - best new game I have played since 2002. However after 4 plays I wonder whether it doesn't quite rank as well with 4 players as it does with 5. With building the second disc on a wonder opening up so much opportunity for the players after you - to attempt to finish a wonder, and therefore control the scoring of it, AND get an action card there is a disincentive to take the second disc of a wonder if you can avoid it. With four players, and 8 wonders, after 8 discs have been selected (one from each wonder, if it progresses that way) then when a player finally chooses not to pass and chooses to take a disc the complete, take a second disc, complete merry go round sees the same players completing wonders (unless they pass). With 5 players this alternates, which I like better.

Instead of bidding, one selects the hand to be played, somewhat controlling the scoring for his turn. A nice variation! Need to be prepared to accept help from your opponent. Also, not being chosen by your opponent for building is a tactic to consider for scoring. Knowing when to play the trader, or when not to, can help in being selected. Some neat decisions to make, but not overwhelming. Play seems best with 4 players. And yes, take out the bonus cards, they do detract from play.

There's a lot to take in and a lot of subtle depth that's not readily apparent in Tower of Babel much like Modern Art.  Lots of strategies to pursue and a lot of things to explore.  There's also the potential for putting together really killer combination plays which is something I am a big fan of. Fantastic game that along with Goa, Amun Re, and Hacienda is turning the Hans im Gluck big box games into a must own series.

Yet another area majority game.  To be fair, this one has a somewhat unique twist in that you can conserve your own resources (cards) by using some from your opponents -- but you in turn give up part of your position to them.  One thing I really like about it: it's a quick game!

This is a good solid game. It's the type where I'm convinced there are strategies I'm missing and need to play numerous more times. My fear is that it will become (to me) like Masons, too much luck involved to really enjoy the experience. I'm sure this will see the table again as it's well liked by the family.

RATING: 7.5
Played without the action cards, and it seems to work well that way (while some of them do look a bit too powerful).  While there's some luck with the cards it's not out of line with the weight and length of the game and it fairly zips along and presents some tricky decisions - mostly towards the end.  Like many of the better Knizia's I suspect that repeat plays will reveal more subtle considerations (Municioium would be a good, recent, example) which would lead to me rating it higher and I look forward to playing again to find out.

OK, well, coming back to this one after a few years off, I'm going to dock the rating just a touch. It's still a very good game, and classic Knizia, but I think the balance on the special action cards is a little off and feels a touch arbitrary, and in general the element of the luck of the draw is not as well managed as it is in Tigris and Euphrates, say. Later in the game, you can end up drawing cards that are worthless. But it scores by being short, and simple and playing well with anywhere from 3-5 players. Like most Knizias, there is more here than meets the eye and it's a lot less chaotic than it can first appear. A very fine game. Just not up to the level of some of Knizia's more recent offerings, like Beowulf, Blue Moon City, or Municipium, which are more complete packages. I do think it's as good as many "classic" Knizias, like Through the Desert.
---
I'm now well past 10 plays on this one, and I really like it. It's unique. There are a lot of interesting choices. There is a lot of information to synthesize and that affects what you do. There is constant activity. It's short-ish. It's variable enough to generate replayability - like Ra, the details of individual decisions change sa lot from moment to moment and game to game. It's not too complex. When I first started playing it, I thought it was neat, but that it wouldn't challenge the classic medium-weight Knizias like Through the Desert or Samurai. Now, I'm not so sure. It might turn out to be one of the greats. It has the additional advantage of not relying on closed scoring, which some find awkward.

Weird play - especially on a night when I was teaching a group to play (and I hadn't yet actually played a full time).  Rest of group didn't seem to catch onto the final scoring at the end and I came back to crush them - but not a great victory because the game itself just seemed a little bleh.

Amun Re lite.  I just don't understand why a deck of unbalanced and, perhaps, gamebreaking cards need to be included in a game like this.  Why not give players the same special ability which would still variate but not destroy the game?  Like the ability to place influence on unscored monuments, or just giving away victory points.  This is as poisoned as Amun Re in this way, but at least it is shorter.  Boo Knizia.

Have played only twice, but seems to have some design issues.  For one, whether you can complete a monument or not depends on the situation left you by the last player, so it's basically not up to you whether you have a crack at "action cards," which in some cases deliver free game-end points, and in all cases deliver an advantage of some kind.  Moreover, whether you can make an offer or not depends on the cards you draw. If you have relevant cards, you can either get in on the deal, or get compensating victory points, but if you don't, you can't even make an offer.  Game seems to have a few problems.

Played it twice tonight (we need to do that more often so people get a feel for it).  Loved it.  Everyone is always involved and there is a lot of subtle strategy involved (what to offer, add the trading, close out a wonder, set up someone for closing, when to end game, etc.).

I love the rapid feeling of always doing something, I mean always, the social aspect of the trading and the decisions relating to the three ways to score points.

I enjoy the choices in this one. It feels familiar in a lot of ways, with mechanics we've seen before. But the way they are blended together, with a theme that works for me, comes across as very original. I'm not sure whether the blue cards might be too chaotic in their impact, but I haven't had enough playings to tell about that. They certainly add an incentive to complete works.

RATING: 6
A solid new area majority game that is worthy of both Knizia and the HiG labels. This seems to take some of the feel of Oasis with its "offer" mechanism, but reverses the flow with the player whose turn it is choosing what type of cards are going to be used to help build a wonder of the ancient world and then the other players all join in to help, in pursuit of influence in the area. (I think this "offer" concept works much, much better in ToB than it did in Oasis too). The game has a number of wheels within wheels (as is normal for Knizia) with points being scored for helping to build monuments, for being successful in leading projects, and for being successful in leading to the conclusion of a wonder. The game also seems to play very quickly, our 4 player game was done in under an hour and that was a big, big plus for a game with the amount of depth that this has. The only caution I feel obligated to offer is in regards to scale, the "I need help" system seems like it will depend on having at least 4 at the table to work effectively, so that will narrow the groups that can play this minorly (or at least, hurts its potential for me since I more frequently have 3)...just something to keep in mind. Overall a solid but not overwhelmingly good title.

Not a bad game, if this is one of your first majority games. However, if you already played many other games of this kind, you might find nothing new except for the VP for rejected players mechanism.

Simple rules, good material.

A lighter thinly themed game in which players are building the eight wonders of the world.  Three chits are randomly placed on each wonder.  Each chit shows the number and type of card that must be used to build it.  A player's sets of chits are worth veeps at the end of the game.  Building is done through collecting sets of cards, declaring that you're going to build a section, play the requisite number and type of card, place that number of your houses on the wonder, then pick up the building chit.  Except... other players are allowed to offer contributions to your wonder section.  If you accept them, they get to place their houses.  If you don't, they earn a veep for each unaccepted card.  If they offer their trader too, you get to place your houses in leiu of theirs, but they earn the building chit.  As each wonder is completed, points are received for first, second, and contributing builders.  The scale of these points increases as wonders are built.  The completing player also earns a special action card, which can be anything from extra victory points to extra card draws.  The game ends as soon as all of one color of building chit is gone from the board.  The game really needs four or five players for the offering mechanic to shine.

Despite the clarity of the rules, it seems to take people a while for their brain to warm up to what's really going on. Classic Knizia, in having to choose what you're going to go for.

RATING: 5
Some people speak very highly of this game of Reiner Knizia, claiming it is a game of insidious subtlety which requires several games to become apparent. The game itself had been collecting dust for nearly a year ere I found time to get it to the table. The first thing I did was to silently remove the action cards from the game, spurred by various reviews and comments claiming they were a later and unnecessary addition by the publisher rather than by the designer. I found the game easy to get into and bereft of Knizia's hallmark: a convoluted way of scoring. It was all rather straightforward and so me and my gaming friends were playing happily within a short while. 

We were not quite sure yet whether the subtlety is worth the high rates, though. Oh, there is subtlety alright. Mastering the decisions regarding cards to play and chip to select (if at all) are not easy, and counter-intuitive ways of playing the game are actually quite successful at times. However, in order to make them sucessful, you need a good selection of cards, and that is where the game in my opinion breaks down somewhat. There are various 'effects' you can aim for when putting a chit on offer; likewise for the players being polled. But if for some reason people 'misread' that offer (either intentionally or on purpose or because they simply cannot respond in a meaningful way) the subtlety looses much of its flair because it simply cannot be fully under your control. Further play made it possible to 'guesstimate' better, but also stressed more and more on each occasion that the fact that you yourself will not know what cards you will hold in five turns—and that more or less sealed the game's fate. The toolbox you are offered to play with the options of the other players is simply too crude to be effective. Another issue I have is that the memory aspect is difficult to keep track of, and that (slightly) careless play will just give the game away. I'd be in favour of playing with these chits open after they have been acquired.

In the end, it's a somewhat interesting game with not-too-simple group dynamics, where nothing (save for the action cards) is truly 'wrong'. Nevertheless, there is nothing truly 'right' either. I learned that the promised subtleness really wouldn't show itself at all, and is mostly invented in the brain of some overeager players who probably think they can see or even steer it. Don't believe them: there isn't any, and what remains of the game itself isn't really all that interesting to be spending hard-earned cash on.

There are 3 ways to score points in this game.  First, the incremental way from declined offers.  Secondly, there is a small set collection mechanic with the building discs.  But the big payoff comes from having the biggest contributions as each wonder is completed.

The strategies required here are still unfolding, and I don't know if I full appreciate the possibilities, particularly with the trading card.  The various parts of the game feel disjointed, and I question if a variant is needed to make it really good.

The components are nice, with a lovely board - but the theme is really pasted on here.  Willing to give this time to grow on me.

Interesting, fun, and even after a dozen plays I still haven't wrapped my head completely around it - gaining points through disc sets is straightforward enough, points from refusal a balancing-act yet understandable... but majority in the wonders is heavily weighted based on the order they complete in (or whether they complete at all), and I'm still figuring how to suss that out.

Production: The cards are nice and simple, with easy-to-distinguish colors.  The wooden houses work well.  The board is attractive, though a bit of a hodge podge of images of the various wonders.  Play: Some interesting choices.  It seems always beneficial to offer up one's cards; either one will get points or houses on the board.  I think the real strategy will become evident over many playings, deciding when to use the %u201CI only want the disc%u201D card, either when I know I am a contender to be selected, or to prevent myself from being selected, and knowing when to build a wonder all by oneself and when to use the help offered.

I felt like I didn't have to think enough for a game that shouldn't have been a filler.  I think there is some subtlety there in terms of figuring out how much to offer, but after seeing one of my opponents completely unable to do anything because he almost never had cards in the right suit to even make a "real" offer, I saw that as a big problem.  Also, it's a little frustrating that which special card was drawn by player one vs. player two ended up determining the winner rather than how well they played.  

Extremely overproduced, it could have been a card game for $15.

Strangely I'm liking this less as I play it more. Maybe its because each time there's been more players and this means there's fewer opportunities to affect the scoring (picking regions & chips).

I picked this game up last week despite the lukewarm comments here at the Geek.

What a pleasant surprise! We played it four times with 4 players and afterwards we spent a lot of time talking about strategy and player psychology etc...

It does clock in at 45 minutes, as advertised, and is a powerful Knizia design, not a "rehash" as several have propounded. 

I give it an 8.6 because it's a strong 8, in my books, with a 60% chance of moving up to a 9 (classic).

Those who rate this below 7 must not like very many Knizia games, as this one is one of his best in a while.

Very average.  The blind bids make it a crap shoot as to whether you have a chance to have your bids selected.  Also, you have little information about other players hands as the draw is blind.  The decision to bid low and hope to get selected (to gain influence) or bid high and just take the vps (from not being selected) feels very arbitrary.  Maybe I'm missing something though and would be willing to try it again.  After several plays, I feel comfortable w/my assessment and this rating.  Near the end of the game when some colors are exhausted, it really sucks to draw dead cards.

RATING: 8
Players are building contractors (I guess!) trying to construct the wonders of the world.  On a turn players either pass (draw cards) or offer a building chip up for completion.  Chips require players to collectively contribute cards to complete the chip.  Being accepted into a build enables you to get markers on the board, for scoring when that wonder is complete.  Being rejected still gives you victory points!  Chips collected also pay off at the end of the game.  A very interactive game, where every decision has consequences.  Felt a bit like a turbo-charged Res Publica.  I like this one.

Great area-influence game unfairly trashed by ruined expectations and general response of "I don't get it" by gamers. 
 
It is a clever combination of area influence meets auctions... and most interesting is the way in which each player's offer is a bundled bid. A brilliant twist for Knizia, who usually uses random tile draws to bundle goods for auctions. 
 
Strangely, HiG chose to make a relatively affordable big-box game out of this, though they could easily have made it a small-box game, as most of the bits are pointless.

I think this game deserves more attention than it's getting.  In most games with trading, a player in the lead often finds that no one will trade with him.  ToB has a brilliant mechanic that allows you to profit from even refused offers.  This game is full of wonderful, tough choices for every player on every turn.  My main concern about the game is that you can often be boxed out of being able to do anything on some turns simply because of your card draw.  I'm not sure how big of a problem this is yet, however, as if you're short of one kind of card that usually means you're stocked in another and can make a big play with them.  So far I've played with 3 and 5.  Three is excellent even though cards were somewhat scarce.  Five is also good, but the number of intervening players between my turns made the game feel a somewhat more chaotic to me.  I suspect that 4 players is the ideal number for this game.

Underrated on BGG in my opinion. I consider it up there with other "Knizia greats". 

My favorite area majority game. It adds two twists to conventional area majority games: variable scoring timing, and cooperation. So it's not just about picking easy fights and winning them, but also the timing, and offering/picking/forcing the most profitable help/cooperation from other players.

This is a sleeper hit! I purchased it for crazy cheap at a flea market and foolishly left it gathering dust on my game shelf after reading the rules. It didn't sound like anything special, so it sat unplayed for several months without me knowing all the gaming goodness that could be found inside. This game is grossly underrated. It's really fast, the decision making is engaging and the mechanisms provide good player interaction. I'm stoked to play this again soon.

[b]10.22.11 Update:[/b] There are so few turns in this game, that the fact that the game can (and often does) end in an uneven amount of turns between players is an issue I'm starting to worry about. Our last 5 player game found three players having 4 turns, one having 5 and one having 6 turns (due to Action card). That means 1 player had 50% more turns than 3 other players. I'm not so sure about how I feel about that, but it doesn't feel right. I think I'll be removing teh Action cards in further plays as has been suggested by the designer.

Blind bidding with hand management involved - luck on draw. Variable game ending condition makes this tense. Almost no downtime.  Be careful of rules a)player on the current turn can not build by his own cards alone, and b)rejected hands scores VP but is then return to user, not discarded. DO NOT PLAY special power cards.

I need to replay Tower of Babel again to have a better idea of the game and see what is best for scoring points. It's not easy to see what is best when using your cards to build wonders. 

There are different ways in Tower of Babel to score points, so how can you judge what is a good exchange and what isn't acceptable ? Do you go for the token or the majority ?

Another game might change the game's rating.

**I recently replayed Tower of Babel. Rating went from a 6 to a 7**

I replayed it again 2 more times. Rating is now an 8.

In my opinion, Tower of Babel is more enjoyable after you played a few games. Also, a downside I find in Tower of Babel, if you don't got the right resource cards at the right time, it can hurt your game a lot. I recall one which I two different kinds resources in my hand and the other players also picked a token which I had no resource cards in my hand. So I couldn't even bet. Therefore, my oppenents gained in points and I received a big fat zero for like 2-3 straight wonders.

TRADED.

Rating back down to a 7.

UPDATE: Going with "one-trick pony." It's one of those euros that has one interesting thing going for it but is otherwise unspectacular. I have enough good games without worrying about mediocre ones.

UPDATE: Knocking off a point because I'm losing interest. Is it a one-trick pony or just minimalist? I don't know.

You are a general contractor building the Seven Wonders of the world. There's the Colossus of Rhodes, the Pyramids, the hanging Gardens, and all the other ones I can never remember.

Besides that, this is a great middleweight Knizia game of bidding and majority control. Every group I have shown it to liked it right away, and the more I play, the more I enjoy the subtlety in the game. It's a lot like Ra, where the values of everything is relative.

I need to give it a try without the bonus cards to see if that takes a little of the randomness out of the game.

This is an area control game with resources/hand management and set collection all thrown into one.  It definitely has a Knizia feel to it.  In fact, it somewhat reminds me of Blue Moon City, in that all the players are working at restoring locations by devoting resources to sub-areas of a location.  Locations when completed initiate a El Grande-esque scoring for 1 region.  The interesting thing is that there is a scoring chart where the scoring values increment higher each time a location is completed and scored.  A lot of the decision making in this game comes from building a sub-area because players will make offers to help the active player build.  Whether you accept help or not, there will be good and bad consequences and figuring out what's in your best interest is really the heart of the game.

This is a good and also pretty quick area control game.  It accommodates 3 and 4 well, but I think a 5th player would inject too many resources into the game.  The main thing I dislike is that there seems to be a bit of a disagreement on what a player can offer when the active player is building:

RATING: 7
We played the nearly finished version yesterday (March 7, 2005)at "Hans im Glück":
This is is an incredibly solid offering bei Reiner Knizia, with all the good and bad things that come with it. It certainly is a flawless and elegant design, with an interesting mechanic at it's core (completing wonders by collecting cards offered by other players) and the game play is fast and keeps your interest. But one should also note that this is yet another "majority-in-an-area/VP track" game. Perhaps we have become a bit jaded- 5 years ago this would have been considered an exceptional design, but one slightly wonders if something apart from this basic game idea wouldn't be something that could be explored by the highly talented Knizia in the future. At least one would hope so. 
Still, another winning entry for the high-quality line of games that "Hans-im-Glück" produces.

A very cleverly-designed game. There are multiple victory paths and many strategies to go about achieving victory but figuring out the strategy is not immediately obvious.

I really like this game a lot, but it didn't go down well with most of the people I played with.

Very Knizia-esque game with an interesting dynamic and lots of majority "wins" points rules. You offer cards to help someone build a monument, if your offer is spurned you get points, but it is better to help build the monument because your meeples in the monument area score bigger points based on being 1st, 2nd, etc.

It's okay but it lacks control. You are entirely at the mercy of the card draw, have the right cards, you can make decisions, have the wrong cards by even just 1, and you've got nothing. After discussing it, we'd rather see an Alan Moon mechanism of a series of open cards which players can pick from or draw off the deck. Weak graphic design and pointless bits suggest a rushed job. Definately an 80% Knizia.

The stamp of Knizia is all over this one.  Simple yet clever and deceiving.  So much more than meets the eye happens during the building phase; be careful what you show other players and as the active player giving out a few VP`s so that another player gets too far ahead is no sin.  Really, really liked playing this one and looking forward to another crack at it.

I played this 2005 game late in December 2009 for the first time and was almost shocked at how much I enjoyed it. I had not heard a lot of good reports on it, and had heard at least one very bad one (from Tom Vasel no less), so I went into this with very low expectations. However, this game scratches the same kind of itch that China or Web of Power scratches for me: a meaty filler that plays in about 45 minutes with a few different ways to get points and some interesting decisions that have multiple effects. This game probably has a tad more luck (with the special action cards), but it also has more interaction, as players bid to help each other build one of the seven wonders of the world (or eight, including the Tower of Babel). I think this is one of Reiner's best games.

Players bid for the right to build sections of the ancient wonders and gain majority when the wonder is complete.  If your bid isn't chosen then you get VPs instead.  The tension comes in trying to select your offer so as to force the selecting player's hand.
The theme is pasted on but works well with the game.

6/25/2015-This(in my humble opinion)is one of Knizia's finest games it uses a lot of interaction between players. It goes with the phrase "you scratch my back I'll scratch yours". You see if you want to build something 9/10 you can't do it without help ,so you have to use cunning tactics to give them enough points to get them to help you ,but not enough to beat you.
I also do not like to use the variant ,because the special cards add another layer of depth to the game.dc


My score is 8.4.dc

In Tower of Babel players build the wonders of the world. It's an area majority game where you get to place your pieces according to how much you contributed to the construction.

The twist is that other players can offer their help. Of course, they won't do so altruistically and before accepting their offers you always need to weigh your own position against their gains.

There is some subtlety involved in making the offers but an awful lot also hinges on the building cards you get since you cannot participate in a stage you don't have the material for. Also, the action cards are entirely unneeded but they are easily disposed of.

[b]Always play this without the "special cards".[/b]  They ruin an otherwise very good game.

Yet another short, simple, interesting, clever game with a hign-level of player interaction and zero down-time from Reiner Knizia.  If he ever runs for "King of the medium-weight Euro" he's got my vote.  Tower of Babel is simply excellent!  A novel mechanic: making offers to a player that are either accepted or rejected (with consequences either way), continuous player interaction, a variety of possible strategies and lots of tough choices make this an excelent Euro. A++  The rules are simple and the game length is short (regardless of the number of players). INTERESTING SIDE NOTE:  Reading through the ratings comments I see people who say "this game is no good with more than 3 players" or "it's best with 5 players" or "the sweet spot is 4" ... I find it curious that there is no consensus.  My personal opinion is that plays equally well with either  4 or 5  but with 3 players there just aren't enough offers.  Go figure.

UPDATE:  The more I play it, the more I like it.  This game is much more than it seems - strategies are subtle and varied.  Really, really, good.

UPDATE: We just tried it for the first time without the "special cards" that are awarded for finishing wonders.  It makes the game even better!

I should like this game more than I do; it may be that I'm put-off by the board itself.  The way in which the various "wonders" are delineated and the artwork itself is very chaotic and the colors are dreary.  It plays quickly, about "Ra" speed, and is easy to teach, however.  I'll play it, but there is a long list of games I prefer to this Knizia.  My copy was a gift-thanks James!

When reading the rules, I didn't know what to think of the game.  We then started to play it and we all had a feeling of "Is that it?"  As the game progressed, the game got more interesting and it became obvious that there is more here beneath the shiny surface.  I will need to play this again to see if I am right.  My initial response is positive on this one, but it's not jumping out at me yet like some other Knizia games.

Update: Well, there is a little more to this, but honestly, I don't think there is that much more.  It's an ok game, but nothing sets it apart.  The production is quite nice, so I will give it credit for that.

On the one hand, I did poorly without having any idea why.  Bad luck of the card draw?  Poor play?  I don't like not knowing why I lost badly.

I love area majority. This is one that is very approachable, light and easy to play (and also includes set collecting). The players in my first game were a little underwhelmed. I liked it more than others and may have a difficult time playing much. 

After a second play I find it to be one of the more confounding games I have played. Not particularly intuitive and thus very difficult to decide what is an optimal play. Of course, terrible plays show themselves from the beginning, but the difference between offering one card or two given which auction and whether or not you want to place pieces or take the token...all very hard to calculate.

That makes a game more enjoyable for me. I love the conversations it produces, even if I dislike the stall in play it occasionally produces as well.

RATING: 8.5
Twelve plays. A unique gamer's middleweight with multiple paths to victory and an otherworldly sense of balance and give-and-take. Under construction are the ancient Greeks' seven wonders of the world plus the biblical tower of Babel, and players take the roles of both foremen and contractors offering their services. Each turn a player can try to complete one third of a wonder, and the other players make offers of help in the form of building materials (cards). Victory points are earned by contributing the majority of resources to each project, successful foremanship (that is, successful project leading and collecting sets of matching building chips), and from consolation points when offers are refused (usually because they cleverly interfere with the goals of the foreman). However, these three approaches are often mutually exclusive, since resources are precious, and so players need to pick their battles very carefully. The three different types of scoring might seem a little overwrought for casual gamers, but otherwise the rules are very simple and streamlined and they keep all the players involved all the time. 

Overall the game has a subtle, cunning feel to it, and it is not about lucky windfalls or bold power grabs but rather reading the situation carefully and knowing which piece of the pie is going to be cheapest and sweetest. One thing that's important to note, however, is that the game is very subtle and it may take new players a couple of tries before they get a handle on what they ought to be doing...so much so, in fact, that I think it's a game that maybe only die-hard Knizia fans are going to end up playing since they're the only ones who'll stick with it long enough to see all the good in it. 

I should also mention that I MUCH prefer playing without the blue bonus cards; they add a little bit of zip to the game, but I don't think they're very well balanced and I think that they sort of "muddy the waters" and distract players from the more important tensions that lie at the heart of things (which is kind of a big deal because the game is, as I said, rather subtle). I've heard that these were not part of the original design but were added by the publisher, and I believe it. Perhaps Hans im Gluck wanted the game to look like another Amun-Re? The only other criticism I have is of the theme, which is a little ill-fitting and not really that compelling. I prefer the game with three or four players, by the way.

Got this for a buck off'n eBay;) We had a full (four games) intro session with this, I didn't like it very much, but the others seemed to like it enough. It doesn't feel like you have much control of your destiny. It seems to me that it would be better if the players accrued the build cards at a slower rate.

Could it be? An almost completely original mechanic from a recent Euro game? Moves quickly, is simple yet awesome, is really novel--and feels different from your other games. Just ditch the silly special cards, they're unbalanced and not sanctioned by the good doctor.

I finally got this old game back to the table! It's still a nice, unusual game with easy rules. Like most old Knizia games, the rules may be short, but the game is tense anyway.

I'm not sure if I will keep it forever, I guess I have to play it 1-2 tiomes more to decide. 

The only thing I dislike are the extra cards. They are unbalanced and drawn randomly. Same as in "Amun-Re" and other older games.

Some parts of this game seem so great. Other parts of it seem so lame. Quick moving and no down time is a plus, lame action cards are a minus. I really enjoy it from time to time but it's definitely 2nd tier Knizia. 
===========
I've seen some stories in the forums indicating that the action cards were not designed by Knizia and that he encourages their removal. Having played both ways I have to agree. With this improvement the game gets bumped up to an 8. I suspect this is where it will stay.

Didnt enjoy this too much.  The score track was cool - where each wonder scored increases the scores for the next one - but needs a better implementation.  I didn't feel any tension in the attempts to build.  I could see it becoming quite tense with an experienced, engaged group but think it's highly unlikely to get that group together, and if i did, i would rather play something else with them.

Picked up out of a bargain bin of demo games at a store. Turned out to be a very good purchase, as its a great game. As has been suggested, I don't use the action cards (I call it an included "expansion"), and the result is a cleanly designed game. Really interesting biding mechanics, and makes for a constantly interactive fight for obtuse scoring opportunities. People do seem to be distracted by the Colossus of Rhodes though...

1st played 11/2707. Taught in ~10min & played ~1hr w/5plyr. A fun building & bidding game w/ decent strategy/luck mix. The board has 8 wonders which you are building. Each building has 3 parts & you build one parts. Discs are placed for each part. Discs have 1 of 4 icons matching cards with #3-6 indicating cards needed to complete. Players either cooperate with a builder (place blocks for VPs later & lose cards) or are turned away (immediate VPs & get cards back). Each player is dealt an initial hand & can either take a card or try to do a build. Each player (not builder) decides if & how many cards to contribute secretly. Then the builder chooses who to partner. If successful, the building is built & builder gets a disc. If not successful, each contributor gets VPs. Dics give you bonus VPs at the end (max 4). Each card chosen gets a block at that wonder for the contributor. Each not chosen gets a VP per. If the builder builds the last of the 3 parts, they get a special card (usually VPs in some fashion). Also the wonder is scored. Each player gets a card after each turn. Game ends when one symbol is missing from the board. I'd strongly recommend giving this a try if you know someone who has it & give consideration for purchase.

Apr08: First play went very well.  It plays quickly, with little downtime and tons of meaningful decisions.  I'm just not convinced it was super fun.  As a strategy game though, it was top notch.

Trying to decide what to offer and what to accept was actually really interesting.  The 3 ways to score mixed together very nicely into a cohesive whole.

I think I'm going to need to own this, although I'm not sure what the family will think of it.

(I play without the bonus cards, without the 2-tone chips and only dealing a max of 4 cards per turn.  The bonus cards in particular utterly ruin the incentive pattern.)

Aug08: Well... three months of ownership and no plays, guess it wasn't that good.  I think it was mostly missing that elusive "fun".

After several games with 3,4 and 5 players, my admiration for Tower of Babel is still increasing. This game has all the hallmarks of a mid-weight Knizia masterpiece: well-balanced, multiple ways to score, only one action per turn and yet plenty of choice. The only slight negative is that the action cards vary considerably in usefulness and add an unneccessary element of chance.

Nice, neat game.  There are more tricks in it than it seems at first.  A lot of interaction with other players.  It ends definitely too soon (home ruled required: game ends when TWO kinds of resource tokens are depleted on the board).

Kind of difficult to figure out how to play it at first (strategy-wise).  And not only at first :D

EDIT: Mixed feelings.  Good games intertwined with not so good ones.  Lukewarm feeelings and 'a-ha, yet _another_ interesting dilemma' thoughts are present even within a single game...  I'd have to play this intensely within a short period of time to make a proper judgment.  
In reality: I played the last game of ToB after 4.5 year break...

EDIT2: I decided that although the game is really neat it doesn't have the sufficient spark.

Sold.

I really liked our first game with 4 players which I have seen is the sweet spot, love the scoring in this as with all Knizia's and the balanced game play. I like that there is joint venture building in this and the way the offers and points are handled with the option of the "traitor" in your offer, all around a fun game with a good bit of strategy. I have heard the card draw can make or break you but it wasn't a factor in our first game, if it poses problems too often this could fall to 7.5 but so far great game that plays fast as well.

Update: 8 => 6.75 Luck can definitely become a factor in the card draw, thankfully the game plays in 45 minutes so its not a game breaker. However the strategy element is on the lower side so this plays like a 45 minute to one hour filler which is a little long, it's a mid-weight at best or a bit lighter and good as a filler but the luck ratio is just a tad high maybe for the weight and length.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (December 2016)

I have had Tower of Babel since May 2015. As it is a Knizia´s design, my desire to play it was very low, but the game can be fun.

The rules could be written much better, but they are very simple. You can explain them under 7 minutes. The game flows pretty quickly, we finished under 50 minutes. I played it with 3 players, but, as a majority game, I think it is best with the full complement of players (5), besides, I feel the game has a low downtime so that player count doesn’t bother me.

The game´s components are ok, the art of the board is gorgeous, but the art of the cards is very bland.

As is usual from Mr. Knizia, the theme is pasted on. The name of the box says “Tower of Babel … or why the eight  wonder was never built” but that question goes unanswered when you play the game.

The decisions needed to play the game aren’t very hard. On your turn you only have 3 choices, you get building cards, you build a wonder or you pass. The meat of the game is to decide when you will build the wonder, how to help other players to build their wonder and to accept or reject said help. The decisions are not obvious because the game has more depth than I initially thought.

There is luck of the draw with the cards, but I feel it is rather low, you can always do something interesting with your cards (except near the end of the game). The action cards do have a lot of uncontrollable luck. I dislike these cards because they take away from the cleanliness of the design and introduce lots of uncontrollable, unbalanced and unfair luck, without the action cards the game would be ok for me.

Bottom line, Tower of Babel can be a good introductory game, but it is way too light for my current tastes. It plays very fast which is a rarity in 5 player games. It has way too much uncontrollable luck.

Enjoyed my 1 playing, but not sure will stand up to repeated plays.  Some of the colours of resources are hard to distinguish quickly.  Constant taking of cards may become frustrating.  Good news is there seem to be several approaches to the game and the tactics/strategy did not seem obvious after 1 play.  Have increased my rating after more plays.  Game is non-obvious from a strategy point of view, but this is actually quite refreshing and the game is quick with several things to think about.
Played again and still enjoy.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Not quite as satisfying as E&T or Amun Re, but only because there is a bit more luck here than in the other two.  (Not a lot, mind you, just some.)  Deeper than Palazzo, with tougher decisions - when should I attempt to build, what should I attempt to build, who's offer is the most beneficial to my position, am I more interested in the building chit or working toward a majority, and finally how much do I offer on my opponent's turns?  

This game feels very mathematical, but not in a dry way.  I like it a lot, and this rating may go up.

Follow up:  this  game is not as good with 3,  since the bidding system gets much less flexible, and builds frequently go to the person who happens to get enough of the right cards to do the build solo.

Update 6/17/06:  This game will be a regular in the rotation for 4 or 5 players.  It's short and yet offers complex decisions.  The luck of the cards is a factor, but since it plays in 45 minutes, not a huge detraction.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
An influence game with just the right amount of luck, Tower of Babel can become quite the brain burner... hard decisions must be made every turn.  It's probably best played with 4 or 5 players.  Not one of Knizia's best designs, but it still provides a nice tense game right to the end.  There's a lot of fun involved in trying to remember who took whick token... the end game bonuses can affect victory points in a major way.

Preliminary rating after two plays would be around 7, but I can see that going up once I get my head around the strategies. My previous experience of area majority games is really only from San Marco and Louis XIV, both of which I was a bit disappointed with. Of the three I like Tower of Babel the best.

It might be worth noting that it went down quite well with the non-gamer friends we played with. The rules themselves are quite easy to explain and after a round or two of play everyone had got it, but it still has a gamer's game feel with the opportunity for different strategies.

Tight design providing some nice tension: give your opponents points or give them area control influence?  The chit set collection and traitor chit-trade-for-influence round it out as a good medium-weight game.  I like the player-controlled end-game trigger.  Haven't played with the producer-created action cards, can't see wanting to, the Knizia-designed rules are plenty for me without chaos from action cards.

Glad I was able to try what some call "Knizia's last great game"... there's still hope for a 2nd golden age though, right, if he tires of fillers and apps?!

In summary it's a GOOD game, but is held back from being "great" (and one I'd want to own) by the really lackluster production and art.  I usually like Franz Vohwinkel's art, but here it's too retiring and kind of bleh.  If the art were more in the line of 7 Wonders, I'd have this game on my wishlist.

The actions and mechanics of this game are so simple, yet they create an elegant system of subtle depth.  I can teach this game and play it in under 45 minutes and then play  a follow up game that plays in under a half hour. But there's nothing sustainable here.  I'm finding that after only a few plays, people lose interest and aren't eager to return.

Update: I raised this rating by .5 after playing without the blue bonus cards.  Originally I feared over simplifying the game but it makes for a better over all experience.  The Blue cards add more tension to the game but I think this tension is unnecessary.  The Blue cards can great too big of an advantage and can be difficult for new players to recognize their value.

The design is beautiful, the components are gorgeous, the game is fast and easy to explain.  I love the dual purpose of all the actions, the awarding of VP for various reasons and the psychology of predicting your opponent's moves.  

Two items of complaint, the turn order track it not needed and the special action cards may be a bit unbalancing.  If you feel this way simply don't use either... problems fixed! The game is now perfect!

Enjoyable entry to the area majority genre. As can be expected from Knizia, Tower of Babel has an elaborate scoring mechanism. The idea of all players being able to contribute towards any build of other players is clever but the simple mechanism of the trader card coupled with a set collection subgame turns this game from a mediocre to a worthy gamers's game. It probably suffered from its dry and subtle nature which is not what people expect from a major German publisher like HiG. As a function thereof it's rather fragile and susceptible to unintended kingmaking when players don't foresee the results of their actions. Better with experienced players, not recommended for casual gamers. No problems with the action cards here.

An area control game, a little bit like Attila. The cooperation aspect of building a Wonder is what makes this game interesting. Bidding to "cooperate" creates choices. Do I bid high to score denial points because I'll be shut out anyway? Do I bid low and sneak into the scoring with a single worker? Do I try to steal the building chip with my trade card? These are the choices that are agonizing for me and will keep me coming back. Another well-balanced and efficient game from Dr. Knizia.

First play was highly enjoyable.  It took a little while for the whole offering/bidding part to click, especially with the trading cards.  I think there are many different things going on, and next time I would approach it differently.

I think this is definitely an underrated game, and I look forward to playing it again.

I will probably have to try this with more players, as the 3 player game didn't go so well. This feels like a mix between El Grande and TtR.

The game is very, very good and extremely good looking. The gameboard is one of the most beautiful I've seen. There isn't anything super original here, but everything fits together seamlessly and you'll have to be quite aware of others' positional playing and to metagame a lot when making decisions. There're enough options for strategy and tactics to keep the game quite fresh during a play and also between plays. The pillars are a fine example of completely useless gaming pieces. Also, like with Amun-Re, RK has tried to ruin this game with special power cards, but even though the cards are of imbalanced power level, they're playing a minor part in the end and as a matter of fact the game gets a lot better if you simply leave those out. Some have been complaining about how the player to your right dictates your play through not setting you up for opportunities to complete the wonders but I think the cards in your hand dictate those possibilities even more. Like in E&T you'll have to play through your own strenghts, i.e. your cards. And in the end, it's quite often about who is the best in making unacceptable bids out of scarce resources.

This feels like half a game. A decent half a game, but half a game it remains. 

You go around bidding on stuff, and if you lose you get veeps and if you win you get more veeps. That's basically the game. You're trying to get area control plus these chips that you can collect in sets, and you're trying to make sure you have area control as late in the game as possible b/c you get more points that way.

Others have pointed out the irrelevance of the board. It's true, the board is completely unnecessary, but hey, at least it's pretty. What I don't get is why they color coded the sets in four different shades of beige. C'est la vie.

There's a good game in here, if you added the other half. As it stands, it's a lot like TTR without the tracklaying, and as such is a bit dull.

It took a second game to get a grip on strategies, and even now (after ~5 games), this never makes you say "Yes! My cool play got me many points!"; instead, you coolly ponder which choice might give you a slight net gain.  Anyway, a good game, dry and contemplative and not combative.

Played this one at BGG.con.  Nice little set collection/area control/bidding game, with a neat mechanic to get VPs even when your bid is not accepted.  This one seems somewhat dry like Amun Re, but seems more interactive that Amun Re as well, so future plays are needed to give a better rating.  It's quite likely it will stay a 7, but it might sneak higher with more experience.

Like the bidding mechanic where if your help gets denied, you get points but otherwise it's a forgettable game.  Mechanic is good, but not good enough to sustain the entire game.  On the plus, it can be relatively quick -- esp if you want the game to end.

Great tension, with such a simple system. This game is underrated to be sure. I haven't played with the apparently game-breaking action cards and it doesn't seem like the game needs them at all. This is a pure game of incentive management and backing your opponents into corners. Played with people who aren't savvy to whats going on it is chaotic.

RATING: 7
At 12 dollars I think this game was a steal.  I know I'm "late to the party" as it seems this game doesn't see the table much for anyone anymore but I don't really see why.  It's a great game especially with 3 that plays fast, is hard to master, but easy to learn.  The trading aspect is very interesting since you need to offer trades in order to get rejected and also in order to get accepted.  

I highly recommend this game.  I don't think it will have infinite replayability and if it came out too often I think it would get dull.  However, I think it is very accesible to non-gamers and a game that could be pulled out often enough to justify owning.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Overall, the game seems pretty fun but can't be taken too seriously.  There's an interesting area-majority game here, but it depends on random card draws and player choice/negotiation, which can be problematic with certain players (favoritism or antagonism).  While there are some nice mechanisms to help compensate for not being selected, the lion's share of points reside in the majority scorings, and these points are less visible for leader-bashing.  You also don't want to finish the second-to-last portion of a wonder, since completion gives someone else an arbitrary bonus, in addition to having final control over the majority rankings.  Further bonuses for a somewhat arbitrary position advantage doesn't seem like the right way to go, though maybe my group wasn't cutthroat enough.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I don't like this on, because there aren't control at all: you are going to need other players "help" to build structures, but at the end they can deside are you playing well or are you struggling. This is a very good example fo games, where it's impossible to play well again and again. Only good part of this is a nice scoring system, but the rest is just a mix of different kind of rules and weird components and all are put in a way too big box. Why Knizia why!?!?!

An interesting blend of area influence and set-collection using simultaneous offerings as the central mechanic.  It's light to medium with very subtle nuances.  It's wonderful thing is how and what to bid, given your cards, to achieve more VPs or keep your cards.  Nice thing is there's no downtime as all are involved in decisions throughout each player's turns and it plays at a very good pace.  One of the rare times that I really dig blind bidding games...

House rule option:  For purists or those who want less randomness, just play without the special bonus cards deck.

I would love to dismiss this game as a good game published in a good year with good production values but what rises it above the norm is its accessibility, the familiarity of the theme and the necceary balancing of your options. The balancing of options is key to the game and where so far I have fallen down but because of its strengths I am happy to play again - with friends, family and gamers - and refine my tactics.  Recommended for the casual gamer and the Knizia groupie.

Nice Knizia. I can't remember whether we played with or without action cards
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
It seems improbable that a game by Reiner Knizia could be underestimated by the gaming community, but that seems to be the case with Tower of Babel. What appears to have happened is gamers looked at the rules and saw nothing more than an area majority game with a minor set collection element tacked on and an original but boring system for placing control markers.

The truth is much less obvious. There are layers of scoring mechanics that work through the simple hub of the building mechanic, relating with it in complex and compelling ways. Together, they produce a surprising variety of strategies and tactics, and that produces tough decisions that I find very interesting.

In any given building session, the active player much choose which combination of wonder and colour he wants to work on, and the cross-section of majority scoring, set collection, and the sting in the tail of the Trade card work to make this a nuanced and tricky proposition. Then offers are made, and the active player must choose realizing the rejected offers score immediate points while accepted offers create strength for majority scoring. Further, he must decide whether to give away the chit or work around any trade card offers.

And that's just the short term considerations.

I think the previous Knizia game ToB reminds me of the most is Modern Art, even though they have almost nothing in common systemically. They share a certain minimalist aesthetic, the need to consider the plans and tendencies of your fellow players, and for the strategic landscape to coalesce slowly out of almost random early plays. Don't read that as saying they are the same game; far from it. The comparisons are telling, but so are the differences.

It's also important to note that, after reading the comments of Joe Gola and Matthew Monin, plus rumours that they were a late addition imposed by the publisher, not part of Knizia's concept, I do not play with the action cards. A quick look will tell you how unbalanced they are, and they are an incentive to do something that gamers do not require an added incentive for (although I can see the appeal for casual/family play).

My only disappointment, and it is a minor one, is that the hand management is boring, which is uncharacteristic for a Knizia game. There is little sense of scarcity, and no decisions to make beyond what building card offers you want to make. Even compared to other middleweight games like Blue Moon City this is oddly thin, since I normally think of hand management as a Knizia signature.

Liked this a lot on the first play.  A little like Oasis- it's all about balancing what you want, what the other players will accept and what you don't want to let them have, with an area control mechanism that means that everyone ends up in a different but viewable position.  One I shall try to acquire at some point. It's nothing like Knizia's really meaty games but it's a bit more than a filler.

Another Knizia auction game with a near 7 rating and a top 500 BGG game.

Nothing seems to stand out making this a must buy, when there are plenty of top rated Knizia games that seem to scratch the auction itch much better.

Great review: http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/161134/tower-of-babel-review

Suggestion: play without action cards.

PRO: 
-- Simple rules
-- easy game play
-- top 500 game
-- cheap (1/10/11: amazon used for $13.50: $7.50 plus $6 shipping)
-- knizia


CON:
-- cannot be played with 2 (unlike RA)
-- Little dry (NGFs seem to not like too much)

Shannon Appelcline's RPG review says: "Tower of Babel is the newest big-box game from Reiner Knizia, and unfortunately it shouldn't be. Knizia serves up a fine combination of majority control, set collection, and blind bidding that create an enjoyable, strategic, and thoughtful light game. However, it's overproduced and overpackaged for what it is. If you don't mind the extra cost, and can set your expectations correctly, however, you might really enjoy this game. "

A game that works mechanically, but is way too dry for my tastes.  The components are second rate - the cards are too small and the bits don't convey much of a theme.  The tokens are also too small and hard to read.  The scoring system is difficult to grasp.  Not enough decision making to make this interesting.  I just don't get the appeal of this game.  I have no desire to play this again.

Theme is a little dry, but the production is beautiful and its a nice tight, solid little area control game. Gameplay is simple but there is a lot of depth in choices and many decisions to be made.

Definitely seems as if it will be quite replayable.

RATING: 6
I have to admit, I am a Knizia fan. I liked this game even though it is a bit more abstract than the theme would suggest. Bid for tokens to score and offer bids to other players for a chance to help build a wonder or score on the track. The strategies are easy to see, picking the right combination is harder. Also, being able to judge what the other players are doing can really help score some big points. I thought this was a very nice mid-weight bidding game. Fun, not overly-long, and nice player interaction.

I had a hard time coming up with a strategy in my first game, but found it enjoyable despite losing horribly.  I think I could play this game every day and not grow tired of it.

**********

Second play gave me a better feel for the game and I only lost by a few points.  I still think the optimal strategy is much more subtle than what I am currently seeing.  Perhaps I am giving Knizia too much credit based on his other offerings?  Probably not.  In any event, this is his second most funky offering, just behind [i]High Society[/i].

**********

Third play resulted in my first win.  Most points were scored via region scoring as I accepted many offers with the trader, giving up the disc to get more of my houses out there and bleed my opponent of cards.  In a late scored region, I was the only player with houses, scoring 18 points, while the other players were shut out.  This, in conjunction with a single set of 4 matching discs (20 points), put me over the top.

So far I have only had a chance to do a couple of dry runs of this game.  I can already tell that it will be an instant hit.  The theme and board could really have been anything and any size.  The real backbone of the game is the cards, on that note my only knock on this game is the size of the cards.  When you consider how large the board is it makes no sense that the cards are as small as they are.  They could have easily made them a standard size.  

Considering that is my only complaint so far I think that is a good sign.  I have yet to see peoples issues with the action cards, but the jury is still out on that one.

For some reason, this game gets little respect here on the Geek.  What I love about Babel is that the whole game is essentially about kingmaking: you're trying to decide how to give the fewest possible points to your opponents, but you *have* to give them something.  This game is a lot deeper than people give it credit for being.

The wide variety of strategies that can be used, the depth of strategic thought that is possible to apply to each turn, and the ability for each player to be both at the whim of other players yet still have a lot of control over their own fate, make the game extremely appealing to me.  The game allows players to "help" other players build wonders; deciding how much to offer (and which offers to accept) is extremely fun (and challenging).  

The first time we played this we completely forgot to use the action cards, but still loved it.  The action cards actually seem somewhat unbalancing, as some give victory points while others only do minor modifications to players' hands.  I'm intrigued by the possibility of playing with the disks not concealed in each player's hand, as that would make bid acceptance even more strategic.

Really clever little game. I like it. The strategies seem quite subtle, and the game is pretty unique. The first game is also probably the last game I'm going to play with the action cards; they just don't seem to fit in the game.

The game is perhaps a bit too subtle, though: it's just not attractive enough to get playing time.

Rarely do I find what I consider to be a light game that also fits in so many good Euro-style elements.  This game won't make your head hurt and can be played in an hour, and is surprisingly fun.  Plenty of neat elements, including hand management, set collection, bluffing, and negotiation.  A splash of luck thrown in which can even the odds for those who aren't as skilled (or, admittedly, throw the leader's points into unreachable territory if things go just right).  I like it.

ToB is one of Knizia's rare oddball games, along with his first Beowulf incarnation. It's a fascinating construct (haha), but I'm not sure of its replay value. However, it creates some delicious decision moments, and so we'll see what a few more plays bring.

A bit unexpected mechanisms join forces in this game. Manage a hand of cards that lets you bid in the building of wonders and claim a majority in them. The challenge is to bid so little that you don't waste your cards and yet so much that it gets expensive for the opponent to reject your bid (since you then score for the cards you bid). 

As many others, I prefer the "pure" auction game without the random action cards awarded to the player who completes a wonder. On the other hand, the absence of this rule increases the risk that you waste your cards on a wonder that no other player is interested in completing. Tower of Babel is worth playing just because it's so unique but I still prefer the more downright games of Knizia.

Update: Sold because I was worried that the card wasting is beyond your control and there are simply better bidding games by Knizia.

Great Game of Building Wonders.  I like the somewhat counter-intuitive feel the game has....very unusual...quick yet challenging so helps rating some...can be played in just about an hour yet solid strategy game with that "meaty" feel!!  Art if fabulous with interesting player interaction.  Difficult to win because so much going on.....takes a while to get used to the mechanisms but that is half the fun of figuring out how to pull out the victory.  May upgrade after further play as it appears to be that good!

Players are building the eight wonders of the world.  The active player picks the type of good (camels, ships, stones, cranes) to be built, and all other players offer goods of that type. The active player may choose offers to aid in the construction; chosen players get to put pieces on the particular wonder for majority scoring purposes, while those who had their offers rejected get compensated with by VPs. The twist is that offers can be put with a trader card that allows the one making the offer to take the good chip from the active player; multiple chips of the same good also score points. 
This is a good game by Knizia, it plays around 45 minutes and there is lots of angst when you are deciding what to offer.

My favorite game from 2005. It is the cleanest area-majority game I have ever seen. Brilliant mechanics of rejection points and disc exchange card. Only thing I don't like about the game are these pasted action cards. But when I talked to Herr Knizia, he mentioned that those cards are not his intention. He said the game is fine without them. So I just play the game without them. Game is actually a lot better that way as there are already enough incentive to complete the wonder.
Lastly, I think graphic and theme are also great. 8th wonder is never built because of the system. Great match of theme and mechanics.
Great short classic mid-weight Knizia with clean rules and subtlities!!

RATING: 5
Meh. 

First impression is that it's a typical Knizia -- the game mechanisms work, but is very abstract and it just didn't grab me.  There are so many other games in this genre that I'd rather play.

Rating based on only one play though, so don't take it too seriously.

Not fun at all. The game is a cold collection of victory points. One of the worst Knizia's game IMO.

RATING: 9
A fast jump up to 9 for this one.  Very quick play and some great decisions.  When do you close out a Wonder?  How long can you let the one you have the majority on wait?  How do you make an offer that will get refused so you can use those cards for another purpose but still get points?  How do you get that third like-colored chip you need?  Delicious.

---update---
Knocked down a point for not scaling well.  Four is definitely the sweet spot.  Not enough offers with 3, too many cards with 5.

--update--
This game is all kinds of excellent with 4, and even 3 (though the play is different) that I can forgive not playing as well with 5.  Back up to 9.

--update--
So so so so so much better without the special cards.  SO much better.  SO SO much better.  Will never play with them again.  There is already plenty of incentive to finish wonders - even if you're not on them (sometimes ESPECIALLY if you're not on them).  Knizia didn't intend them so I won't have them.

Cagey, quick-moving title that is actually an auction game in disguise. However, rather than bidding in an attempt to win auctions, you sometimes bid to lose -- because you score victory points for good bids that are rejected by the auctioneer. This means reading the auctioneer and then bidding accordingly. It's a game of much conniving, with about 5 or 6 concerns to think about the whole time -- (1) getting area majority, or at least presence, on each wonder, (2) getting 2, 3, or 4 building tiles of the same kind, (3) managing end-game triggering conditions, (4) finishing wonders to obtain action cards and trigger scoring, (5) fulfilling/maximizing VP-scoring conditions on the aforementioned action cards, and (6) putting together the best bid for your purposes/trying to figure out which part of which wonder to build. One stumbling block for our learning game was figuring out the usages of the trading card -- whether to use it or not (don't use it if you want to gain a foothold in a wonder), and if used, whether to use it to sweeten an offer (in order to obtain the building tile) or to deter the auctioneer (in order to gain the victory points for rejected bid). All in all a great combination of concerns for a game. The one glaring flaw is one that also affects the otherwise-excellent Fortuna -- too much of the final outcome may be swung based on the action card (= bonus card in Fortuna) you happen to draw. Some, drawn early enough, can mean +8 points in the final tally (translating to about a 15% bump in final score), while most others do not confer VPs at all. A 15% bump for luck of the draw seems excessive in a game like this, but on the plus side, Babel plays pretty quickly.

Cool bidding mechanic. Having to decide between board position and end game victory points makes the bidding interesting. Playing without the special cards makes the game much different.

Picked up this bluffing/area majority/set collection on a whim on Amazon and played it in three days. While it may not be Reiner's best game, Tower of Babel was still enjoyable as I still couldn't grasp the strategy or figure where most of the points came from. The game design is really simple and turns move fast; the best part is that there is no downtime as you can help build on everyone's turn. And we finished it in the time it says on the box (a phenomenon which never happens). Cute game that I will definitely play again.

I was more impressed at first, but it is a clever game anyway.

The edition is bad: unnecessary components, board too big, special cards not designed by Knizia himself. Throw away the special cards, turn a blind eye to the components and then you will have a good experience.

Everytime we've played, we've looked at each other at the end and wondered why and how the winner won, as opposed to someone else. There's an interesting mechanic to explore, but anything that abstruse doesn't lend itself to replay and the rating keeps falling as a result.

The games became more and more about choosing who you reckoned was coming last, which meant the games became tighter, which meant the game came down to the final cards and the final points (the big IF being that everyone was assessing place correctly along the way), and no one seemed particularly enamoured with the end result, rarely even the winner.

There is a lot of strategic elements in this game but I do find that it can end some what abruptly especially if you have not been paying attention to the remaining building tiles on the board. I had a game that ended sometime after 30 mins because a player had no other building cards to play. Surprisngly short game.

A light euro with an area majority mechanic.  The theme is thin. [i]Soap bubble thin[/i]. As has been so helpfully suggested here by Gola and others, we play without the action cards.  This brings into focus the curiously balanced decisions that characterize this game.  

I love the way the difference between offering one card and two cards can shift the balance for you or against you in critical places.  The numbers are finely honed here.  

Still, I wish there was just a little more to this game - another layer of play. I want a little Amun-Re or Taj Mahal. I can understand why the publisher wanted to include action cards. It just happened to make the game worse not better.

RATING: 6
This game reminds me a little of Santiago in that everyone makes the current player an offer, and then that player must choose which to accept (and doesn't need to accept the most lucrative one).  You score through either majorities or set collection, so you have to be very careful about what you let your opponents have.  That said, this is a pretty quick game that didn't really hook itself on me.

This game, where you're working together to build the ancient wonders of the world, is interesting. You have to decide when to accept help from other players and whether that help is going to hurt you in the end when it comes to scoring.

Played this once with a mixed group.  To me, it played like a "light heavy" -- not nearly as interesting as Taj Mahal, but with a little too much pretense to that.

Uh,oh. Once I heard that deal making was involved, my interest waned. (Apart from the simplicity of Settlers, this mechanic in freeform isn't a favourite of mine as it can bog down in calculation, negotiation etc). But here the deals are (easy to follow) tabled offers, and the unusual Knizia twists are snubbed offers get vps and the inclusion of the trading card narrows the active player's choice. Also it's a majorities style scoring, which again isn't an enjoyable game feature for me, but it appears simpler here as each is scored separately and once only. Play twice and the subtleties of deals and building selection are starting to kick in. Still alittle too mathematical but willing to explore more.

This is a great game for three players but is less enjoyable with more. (With 4 or 5 there are usually too many cards being offered.) Not that it is a bad game with more; simply not as good.

I really want to like Tower of Babel but I’m not sure I do yet. I can see how clever it is, but so far it’s felt so opaque when I’m playing that I haven’t really been able to appreciate it. There haven’t been any obvious moments when I’ve felt like I (or anybody else) had made a really great play, which makes it feel a bit flat. I’m also not keen on the board design: I think scoring tracks for each wonder might have helped visualise what’s going on better. That said, I did find myself thinking about it a lot and wanting to play again

There's definitely a lot of depth in this game.  However, the theme is a weak facade that was completely tacked on without much artistic integration (unlike the wonders you are supposed to be building).  The art is nice to look at, but the game wouldn't lose anything if the regions were given large letter designations, the building cards were large monochromatic squares, and the houses were generic cubes.  Fortunately, upholding the theme is unnecessary for the solid game below.  The pacing of this game seems a bit odd and appears to undo a lot of the strategic elements.

Another Knizia game. Points are scored for being the principal constructor of a monument, for your assistance being turned down by other players, for being responsible for a majority of a particular type of construction. The game's central conceit is a mechanism in which the player who is undertaking a construction is offered help by the other players, help which either gives them a share in the work, or gives them credit for that particular element, or if refused gives them points.

The game has two problems. One is a set of very random bonus cards, which are likely to make the difference between who wins and who loses, the second is that needs quite a crowd of players to make the central trading mechanism really interesting. I played with three and that wasn't quite enough. So probably only works with four or five (which is a pretty restricted range for a game).

RATING: 7
Based on one play.  Lighter and more entertaining than one would think just looking at the board.  Like Oasis, it's a bidding game that stands out because it has a warm human element.  Bids are made in the hopes that a specific player will accept/reject your offer, so you have to think about other people's behavior!  Simpler than oasis in terms of rules, but also a shorter game.  Seems to be a few ways to work the game strategically, and I look forward to fiddling with it, at least for a few more games.  The game is short, so I forgive it for being a bit repetitive and not having much of a dramatic storyline.  I have somewhat less ability to forgive the fact that the theme makes absolutely no sense--isn't there some way of fitting a proper theme--one that makes you feel like you're doing something other than just gaining points?

RATING: 8.5
Underrated.  Simple point grab game that leaves you feeling good after every player's turn.  Simple. Fast. Elegant.  Occasionally your future rests in the hands of another player, which stops me from giving it a higher score.

Really unlike any other game I can think of offhand.  In a time when the good Dr. Knizia hasn't released just a ton of really original stuff, this one has a unique feel.  Every time I play, I adjust my thinking as to how I should be offering.  Definitely looking forward to getting this one on the table again soon.

EDIT: Bumped rating up after another play.  Consistently enjoy this.  Now on my wishlist to own.

Had it for a number of years, and finally played for the first time on Feb 26, 2015 in a 3p game during a snow day.  As suggested here on BGG, we didn't play with the action cards, and ignored the turn order track.  Would like to play with 4 or 5p as I think the offers would be more compelling and present more choices. UPDATE 28Feb15: Yep, 5p is better!

Interesting little game. The box size and component quality suggest something lengthy and reasonably complex, but this is essentially a light filler. Knizia uses set collection and area control to great effect. In a way, it shares some similarities to a previous Knizia effort, Municipium. That game uses area control to gain sets, and this one uses set collection to gain area control.

I like the decisions this game presents you with, and the card offering is something unique I haven't seen before. Great components and a brief play time make this something I'd like to see again.

I was only moderately impressed with this in my initial plays, but upon returning to it after a year or so, it compares very favorably for me with other abstracted area control games.  This one is fluid and decisions are key.  I enjoy area control games where even the smallest contributors score something and if you play well, you can score a ton of points without being the projected winner.

I was really hoping this game was going to be good. It seemed like it had a lot of one of my favorite components: Player Interaction. Being able to ask for help in Cosmic Encounter is one of the best parts about the game, it creates minimal downtime, and downtime is one of my most hated things in games. Tower of Babel fell very flat in that regard. There really isn't much to it at all. The player interaction is very minimal. People just offer you cards, and you can take them if you want, or not. Then you build a wonder or don't, then your turn ends. You don't have to speak at all, really. Yawn.

I'm starting to feel predisposed against every game that has the word "Knizia" in their box, cause lately they are usually overproduced, unoriginal, without any tension, with very bland mechanics and with the same unintuitive and boring scoring system.  [i]Tower of Babel[/i] is, easily, the worst game of majorities that I've played, and support all the above affirmations.  Its mechanism is a unelegant card collection one to form sets, asking the other players for interested help; simply boring and non sense.  Even when the game has a theme, it is so mindless pasted that it directly shows as an abstract.

A pretty unique area control game.  There's a joke in my group about how "everybody draw cards and everybody scores points", I'd like to play this more to get a better feel for it, but I've enjoyed every play so far.  I've never played with the added cards.

RATING: 8
Wow! I had this game sitting on my shelf for three years before I got around to playing it... wish I had played it sooner! This is one of those games where you will be scratching your head in your first game - players won't really know what the best plays are but slowly, as you play, you will notice subtleties emerging. By the end of my first game, it still hadn't clicked but I was eager to try it again.

The rules are very simple (draw two cards or attempt to build; that's it) but the tactical play is incredibly nuanced - as such, this shouldn't be considered a gateway game due to wise choices aren't apparent within the first game.

Though this is a game I am very excited about, I can see this game failing for people who tend to only play with casual gamers where returning to the same game is not common; this game demands at least two plays for the strategy to emerge.

Yes, the theme is paper-thin but the gameplay transcends it to make this a rewarding experience. Highly recommended!

This is my tentative rating - it will probably increase after more plays!

Fascinating tactical bidding game.  I love how each player is involved on every single turn.  Zero downtime, what a concept!  And it's not easy to figure out if you want to go for influence or for the disks.  And let's not even get into whether to end the game.  Lots of great, difficult decisions!  It plays differently with 3, 4 and 5, which is a great thing.  This definitely has the potential to be a classic.

It's a nicely balanced/designed game, at least without the special cards (I've only played once, and I played without them)... it's just not particularly [i]fun[/i]. Also, while I felt choices were interesting mid-game, near the end it seemed to get less interesting. Not sure why.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Very tough decisions in this one, as there are several elements to consider: set collection, majorities and the timing of the majority scoring, often with disparate and conflicting ways to control them. If you're the contractor, you want to consider what people want, what they'll help you with (giving this a strong economic flavor), and it's entirely possible to make a dumb-shit move and not realize it till after the fact.

This is like the cousin of Stephenson's Rocket, with the same essence of creating tough choices for other players, while trying to find a middling ground when somebody does it to you. Except the stakes at play are clearer with this game, because you literally offer stuff, and accept or reject offers. Stephenson's is more abstract and subtle. Tower is much less computational. Also, Tower of Babel is majority, whereas Stephenson's is majority with strong spatial elements. 

I like this. It's fun to figure out people's attitude to different things, then watch their face scrunch up in horror as you pick the exact contract to leverage it, be it through getting construction help from somebody you know who really needs the huts on that wonder, or getting somebody to cough up the trader so you can attain the majority. It's fun to balance the need to build a majority at a wonder with building it slowly so it's worth more points. It's fun to figure out what to offer, such that the contractor accepts if you want it accepted, rejects if you want it rejected, and you milk the most possible surplus out of the deal. Tough, interesting decisions are fun. Tower of Babel is bucketloads of fun.

[2 plays] This is not a perfect game. The theme is almost non existent, the card colors need to be more distinct, and it really could probably just be a small box card game rather than a Puerto Rico sized boardgame.

Forget all that now, and just realize that what remains is a fairly quick and tense card game that delivers significant punch for its game length. The psychological war of making profitable offers to your opponents is delicious. There are delightful challenges in figuring out when to push for blue cards (on the whole they become less valuable the further you are in the game), when to push for disc collection vs monument scoring, and calculating when to keep your powder dry for another day.

I really look forward to more of this.

Most recent plays Cabin.con 2011 with Garrett, Michael, and Corey.

RATING: 6.5
This game falls flat with 3 players. More players add tension to the negotiation offers.

The game sees players trying to pick up cards towards building wonders. Each completed part of the wonder gives plyers influence towards VPs when the wonder is completed.

Players can also pass and pick up an extra card each round hoping to get sets, Ticket to Ride style.

Ultimately, there's a bit of randomness with the card draws. Try not to spread too thin. There are multiple ways to score; completing wonders and having influence there. Picking up individual wonder parts (St Petersburg Aristocract style scoring).

It's fairly lightweight, plays fast. The graphic design doesn't work for me. It doesn't gel nicely.

Perhaps I'm missing something here.

Everything about Tower of Babel is a trumped up facsimile of game.  There are decisions that you can make, but most of them are irrelevant.  All of the choices that you can possibly make are based solely on what cards you get.  Now the same can be said in many games, but in this one there isn't much you can do with an awkward draw.

There is a compensation to this that is put into the game, if you get turned down you get points, but if you don't get the cards you need then you can't do what you want nor can you offer to get turned down.  This makes collecting the shields random and the only decision you make when vying for occupation is when to not bother to try for first or second.  

You can put up bids for shields where you don't have the cards, but if others don't have any cards you lose your turn and its advantage.  All in all the few decisions to be made are fairly obvious, and the results random.

Then, of course, there is the fact that this should really just be a card game.  The board is worthless, and the turn order markers are the some of the most useless bits I've ever seen in a game. Taking the effort to move them around is an exercise in futility and wasted energy, a perfect metaphor for the game play.

(This rating is not based on the single suit chips and a four player game.  I was recommended to try this again with the advanced chips. I'd be willing to give this another go with the dual suit chips)

In some ways this takes the worst part from Apples to Apples.

RATING: 5
Average Reiner Knizia set-collection majority auction thingy with an interesting central mechanism: players want to get others to assist them to build by contributing some of the required resources. If an offer of assistance is rebuffed, that player gets points; if accepted, they add tokens towards the area majority. In theory, this makes for a fascinating incentive-management exercise. In practice, the hidden information (cards in hand, cards bid) tends to make the decisions less interesting than they could be: less second-guessing and more of the regular sort.

I would be somewhat interested in trying this again with some sort of perfect information variant but not otherwise.

As a person with limited storage, the gross waste of space is also rather irritating. Half of the components, including the board, are unnecessary; it could've fit in a box a quarter of the size.

I may be in the minority, but I really like the subtle colors; however, despite the beautiful artwork this game suffers from a total lack of theme.

Taj Mahal turned inside out. A game of gaining as much as you can whilst spending as little effort as possible, leeching off other player's efforts, forcing and avoiding dilemmas. Constant interaction: even on your turn, all your opponents get to make a decision almost as important as your own. One of my favourite games to teach - I particularly like the bemused looks as you explain the dry mechanisms, and the silence that often accompanies a player's first attempt at building, when he realises it's not quite the no-brainer he imagined. Don't bother with the bonus cards.

tl;dr: OK majority game

So this is JAMG (just another majority game). Play some cards, get some wooden bits on the board and at certain points score for majority.
There's also a kind of set collection mechanism going on with the tokens. If you have multiple of the same kind, you score points for them. More is better. This is where the main draw from the game comes from I guess, since you can get tokens on other players turns by playing the merchant card. But if you do, they're less likely to choose you as contributing partner.
It all works well and there's some nice push and pull going on as you'd expect, but this game doesn't stand out in any way. A very average Hans in Glück game.

The problem for me with Tower of Babel is not the game itself, which, in true Knizia style is simple to play yet challenging to master.  The issue is the theme. I can take a pasted-on theme with the best of them, but in this case the similar washed out look of the cards  and their graphics meant that instead of supplying camels, builders or supplies to complete a wonder, I was just playing card colours. If the graphical design had been better, I think the theme would have been enhanced, and I would have enjoyed this game more than I did.

Game was a lot of fun at first and played very quickly, but the strategy seems to not be there. The winner seems to be the one who offers the maximum number of building cards to assist on every build. Be the person whose good cards match everybody else's proposed build and you win! Pretty easy game for newbies to understand, so the game is a decent gateway game.

Tower of Babel is a soothing way to pass the time, but it is so subtle that you might need something else in the room to anchor everyone's attention.  Rio Grande [rightly] observed that Knizia's core game was bland and then [wrongly] added unbalanced action cards and a variable turn order that never changes.  These tweaks  worsen the game.

A fun trading game, but with it needing at least 4 players to work to its best i don't play it much.  i've also aquired other trading games which have shown the Tower of Babels tactics to be a little simplistic.  Fun and a great introduction into this style of game and a nice board/peices.  Definetely a good buy for 10+ people who are just getting into playing group board games.

I think this is a better game without the special action cards, which add significant chaos to what is otherwise a very nice tactical game.  The action cards were added by the publisher and are not part of Knizia's original design.

Super fun.  Balance between reading players, bluffing, and pressing your luck... all included with multiple paths to victory and many ways to score points.  I love you Reiner Knizia.Blue Moon City seems to have rendered this game pointless for me.  The competitive cooperation, hand management game works better in Blue Moon City.  While I do like this game, myself and my game group prefer Blue Moon City, so I'm unsure if this will gather much play.UPDATE:  Blue Moon City has not rendered this game useless.  Initially they had a similar feeling... but that has passed.  It must have been what I had for dinner that night causing that feeling.  The power cards detract from the game.  Play without them.  It feels much purer, and plays at a nicer tempo without them.  The more I play, the more I like this.  Its a keeper.  Rating without power cards = 8.  Rating with power cards = 6.

Simple rules, great game. It plays great with 3 or 4 players. With 5 players, there are so many cards available that the game looses its tension.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
I enjoyed this game quite a bit. It is easy to get into it - the rules are Knizia's style: 4 pages, with images. Explain it takes about 5 minutes.

The gameplay is straight foward and a match can be over in about 30 minutes (though the estimated 45 minutes is closer to home).

The downside resides in the luck of the draw: one player can have the lack of luck to keep taking cards that:
A) No one else is investing in;
B) The available tokens are in places that you don't want (be for the type, be for how many of the others occupy the Wonder).

I'm considering making a house rule for this that puts together Ticket to Ride and Tower of Babel:
- Reveal a number of cards equal to the number of players: the player whose turn is choose one, than the next player and so forth until all were taken;
- If the players passes, he/she takes one card blind from the deck, and then the cards are revealed for distribution;
- When a player complete a Wonder, he/she takes 3 Action cards, chooses one, and discard the others.

I know this might make the game less "co-op" (the blind draw forces you to accept help to take some tokens or to make your position in the construction of the Wonder better), but I think that could still have enough reasons to accept help (two are: to keep cards in hand to receive the refuse points, or the try for another token of the same type later on).

I will see how this will turn up.

*****

Update:
Haven't tryed yet the variant, basically because now I don't think is really necessary. The second game was smoother than the first one (we played without the action cards and no one seemed to be having bad luck in the draw of the cards). The new players loved the game and wanted to play again right after - not something common in our gaming group. This one appears to be another winner from Knizia.

RATING: 6.5
Played without the action cards, but it still feels too random as you get cards into your hand randomly and I feel like they dictate what you can do. Game seemed frequently to play itself, as they say.

The design is still interesting though. It's basically area majority and set collection that require cooperation to accomplish. Players simultaneously make offers to help (a mechanism that neither necessarily requires nor even permits negotiation), and the active player is constrained to taking the entirety of a given offer or none of it (which can affect what he will get out of it).

If the random card draws were converted into a draft from a small selection, (the game would take longer but) it might become something quite interesting.

Another typical Knizia game.... which does not mean it is bad. This game has Knizia's fingerprints everywhere. Each turn, player actions are limited to either pass or build, but like Samurai or Stephenson's rocket or Durch Die Wuste, where to build efficiently is the tough question. The multiple scoring paths with the trade-offs between immediate gain (scoring wonders) versus end-game scoring (tokens) is delicious. Another Knizia signature is the forced abrupt end-game scenario. Once all the tokens of a particular type is gone from the board, the game ends. Very much like Through the Desert when one color of the camel is exhausted, the game ends.

I enjoyed Knizia when I started Euro-gaming. I still like him quite a bit. His games are what I would call "Elegant", but nothing he has developed lately really surprises me anymore. Will play it and enjoy it sporadically.

I played this at WBC 2005.  This is a game of conselation prizes.  If you have something to offer, then you get something from every deal, even if your offer isn't accepted.  It seems like a solid game, but nothing about it struck me as a must buy.  I'll have to try it again.

Great subtleness in 45 mins. The game is a blend of area control, set collection and blind bidding. Guessing if your opponents will bid for area control or the token (or neither) creates the tension in this game. Receiving points for rejected bids is tactically very interesting. Ditch the special cards: they aren't needed.

RATING: 8
very fun game with more than 3players -- gets kind of dull with 3 and less; co-op building mechanic for maximum points; some card playing/bidding; you build the 7 Wonders of the ancient world (but not like in 7 Wonders the board game which has nothing at all to do with this game) while outmaneuvering your opponents for the most points through area control; I think this one slipped under the radar of most gamers when it was released; pleasant little gem in my books

RATING: 6.5
The action cards feel awkwardly tacked on (probably because they are - weren't in the original design).  Gameplay is unique enough to be interesting and enjoyable, but ends up feeling like a bit of a mess where it's very difficult to get a decent idea what you want to do.  (While difficult valuations can definitely be good, I feel it is often overly obtuse here.)

This one didn't impress me much, partly because of the bonus deck that seemed to sway the game too much in one direction.  The collection mechanic is OK, but combined with the card that takes the token from the "supervisor," it left a lot of the decisions out of my control.

1 play: 4 players

RATING: 8.5
Three plays, each with 4 players.

First play was to feel out the game, as all of the players were new.  Frontrunner ended up winning, not surprisingly, as we weren't being too strategic about our offers.

Second play had the same winner, but everyone scored more points and it was a closer match.

Third play swapped out one of the players for a new player (my wife).  She's an experienced gamer and picked up the rules quickly, adopting a strategy none of us had tried yet and she won the game.

If it wasn't so late, we would have played again.  Very enjoyable, glad we bought it.

Very different playing experience with 3, 4, and 5 players, as the more players in the game, the fewer turns you have, which gives you fewer chances to drive specific wonders towards completion. As such, I prefer the game with only three, but all numbers provide a good gaming experience since everyone is involved on every turn.

Brain frying, delightful, everything I was really hoping for from a new Knizia. Wonderfully unintuitive, which is the opposite of horribly unintuitive (cf. Acquire).

This game is a real JEWEL, the fruit of craftsmanship and geniality. Surely one of the best games i have ever played. Simple enough rules, very very deep, correct dose of interaction, tactics, strategy in the correct mix. And the mechanics is really really an example of art in game making.

It is wonderful in 3,4 and 5 players, but the game experience in each of them is quite different.

I like that it is slightly cooperative and it involves everyone on every turn. The game seems more friendly because of that and is far more engaging/stimulating than some other games.

Seems a bit dry and simultaneous bid/offer is never my cup of tea, but I am interested in the interaction mechanisms of selecting the person to help you build. Want to try with a group of 5, but haven't had the right opportunity.
'17/11/02: Played with a group of 4 and really enjoyed the choices of what disc to choose, what offers to accept and what bids to make. Its tricky and dynamic, with a nice escalation and endgame scoring. Really solid. (Played without the action cards, they seem unnecessary)

290805. Seems to be an all-too-often thing for me with knizia games..First and second play, I don't really enjoy it as much as I thought I would. Then following that, I begin to notice the subtleties of play, the little details to the game mechanism that, with experience, you can manipulate to improve your chance of a win, and the multiple paths to victory, where nothing is a given cert. I suspect I'll grow to love tower of Babel with more plays, but at the moment it holds pretty steady. After 3 plays..yep..I like it. Many decisions to consider, many ways to win.
150510 update. This is the last of knizia big box line. This game seemed to have really swept right under the radar for most BGGers. I think their is a lot going on within a small gaming time frame that it deserves more kudos. I've upped my rating to a 9.
UPDATE: 060311 Further Plays, I believe this was Knizia's final classic. Sure it's a medium/lightweight but there are many mnay subtleties to the game. I think people will mourn it's loss when it's out of print and copies are scarce.

Played a few times (with 3 or 4 players). I cannot say this game does not work - it works actually quite well, but it remains very cold and dry, with nothing original enough which would convince me to buy it, or even play it again rather than another game. Some of the action cards seem to be unbalanced - it might be a wrong feeling after so few plays, though.

RATING: 8
My favorite area majority game. Lots of player interaction and good decisions. So many ways to reach your goals, all of which can lead to victory when done right. The key to this game is finding offers that help both you and the player whose turn it is; if you make such offers often, you will be constantly benefiting, and will win the game.

This is the game that made me decide to collect Knizia games. I was already a big fan of some of his games (Ra, T&E, etc.), but seeing how clever he made this little game convinced me that I wanted to see how as many of his games as possible worked!

I only play without the bonus cards. If you have this game, just leave them out; Knizia did not intend them to be there, and they are not needed (in fact they unbalance the game).

This is a game that looks like it might be a strategy game, but in fact I can discern no long term strategy potential.

This one was a pleasant surprise for everyone involved.  There's a major balancing act, with lots of things vying for resources.  After our first play, I felt like I had made a lot of different mistakes throughout the game, and it feels good to lose based on perceived mistakes, rather than some factor that isn't even apparent to you.  Probably too dry for a lot of people, but if you liked Knizia games like Amun Re and Taj Mahal, you'll probably enjoy this game.

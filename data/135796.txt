After playing the Khaosiung scenario with standard rules, I must say that my initial rating is confirmed.

Very nice gameplay, and I cannot wait to do a campaign game with advanced rules.

This game system has really grown on me ... for the most part. The Advanced Air Game is a *huge* pain in the ass and arguably makes the game worse in almost every imaginable way. Tons and tons of die rolling for little gain in realism and no gaming payoff at all. Stick with 29.1, use the airpower points from the basic game. You'll have to fudge a little, the rules aren't totally complete, but it's better than wrestling with this beast of a system.

In general, although I like the game, it has a lot of feeling of half-assed-ness: wrong cross-references on the player aids, rules that you have to closely parse to figure out what the hell they are saying, notes on charts not updated for the new game, rules in odd places and not cross-referenced (like what exactly a carrier air wing is made up, what the terrain type of an off board box is, whether or not Allied SOF can target airbases in China, and so on), simple things over-explained while complex things are under-explained ... at the end of the day I think the rules are either complete or really close, but man, they are a bear.

Anyway, moreso than Korea, this is an interesting situation. PRC will have trouble with their lift capacity and bringing enough hitting power to take and clear the big cities against and real opposition - they lack and heavily-armed shock troops or crack divisions - so they'll need to rely both on the threat and the actuality of multiple landing points; get the beachhead back in stock ASAP! On the other hand, they have crushing air superiority for quite a while. You can potentially use this to disable ROC HQ units and attack helicopters, which should help a lot, but in practice ROC HQs in cities and urban areas are hard to hit. Clearing the cities is also a huge manpower problem. All in all, I think the PRC has an uphill battle here, but it's an interesting one. And I haven't played a ton so I could be wrong :)

Really an interesting game. A lot of decision making and several very interesting subsystems .
The only problem is that the rules are harder to understand than they should be. However the online support from the designer and others is excellent.

A great game once everything starts coming along.  

However, my score is lowered due to the heavy-handed rules and the fact that cross-referencing the two rulebooks (general series rules and game specific rules) and two sets of general rules (standard and advanced) is a bit of a struggle, especially when learning the game. 

The whole thing could do with some streamlining, layout and language-wise. The actual game is complex as it is, there's really no need to make it even more challenging to get into.

RATING: 7.1
Nice package (map, counters, rulesets, playaids).

Boot camped it. See my session report (1st Mn Jan 9, 2014). Enjoyed it, but, just wishing it would have moved beyond IGYG (I go You go and you can't respond to my moves - and all my units move without friction) model that is very tired and been thankfully retired by Herman (card driven wargames), Berg (chit activation), Raicer (who dabbles in both), etc. The IGYG isn't a show stopper with Taiwan since there are so many other impressive design decisions/game mechanics.

Also, I do really respect this effort in tackling the VERY difficult integrated land/air/sea challenge (you can count decent land/air/sea games on one hand).

And, we had fun. Thumbs up. Looking forward to linking with first game in the series (Korea) and spending a weekend with it.

Just travel and back from Taiwan in this month (September 2015) and I received this game right away.  Gorgeous looking map and the system is growing!  

I learned the concept of "Urban Clearance" in this game. Quite enlightening. The tiny island is subject to attacks from all directions over. A very meaty system for a size that is just right.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A good operational scale combined arms amphibious/air assault game.  High quality map, pieces and player aids.  The Next War rule system is well thought out and extends well to the Taiwan situation.  The rules are clear and 99.9% complete.  Alas, there are a lot of rules, so that last 1/10 of a percent gap (e.g. no armored recon on the terrain costs chart) add up to about as many thin spots as in less "GMT-perfect" games.

While the political aspects of the campaign scenarios can be a real game changer, you can always hard wire which outside natisons get involved when as a means of adjusting play balance.  Letting the US and Japan get involved only in the air and sea aspects might give the best balance overall. Letting the US bring in ground forces definitely tilted the tables in Taiwan's favor, but it looks like they would have been slowly ground down without at least some outside support.

If you want the monster game air/land/sea battle experience on one map and in a reasonable amount of game time (20 to 40 hours for the full campaign with the advanced rules) then Next War: Taiwan is a great choice.  If you'd rather not memorize three complete sets of rules (land, air, and sea), then stick to the "standard" game rather than the "advanced".  The standard game is about as complex as GMT's Eastern Front or Road to Wherever series, which it resembles in many ways. Supply is more like that MMP's Operational Combat Series, but the island is small enough that it rarely becomes an issue.

I'd rate this game a 9 if my rule memory weren't just a tad short of its demands.

Rating is for the standard game, there is a bit of a learning curve, however this is to be expected by learning any new system. Despite this, the Designer Mitch, is an excellent guy quick and helpful. The game itself once you learn it plays fluidly and is fun. The rarity of the subject matter alone gets it a bonus point. Very enjoyable experience.

In the end reduced this from a 9 to a 7. The naval rules aspect just in the basic game was a a lot to grok for solo play. The above though is not diminish, Mitch is great, period. Very interested in games in the series that have limited naval aspects, which is why I own NW:K and NW:IP, as well has having NW: P on P500.

Me parece fantástica esta serie de Next War....., Todavía estoy en proceso de asimilación de las reglas standar....,pero me parece genial el juego de mecánicas terrestres, aéreas y navales.... 
Las reglas no son complicadas una vez las vas aplicando, pero conlleva una gran cantidad de toma de decisiones....

RATING: 9
Similar to GMT's East Front Series in that the game has outstanding components, series rules, game specific rules, examples of play, and everything has been thought out very carefully for the game layout.  The standard game is not very difficult, but the advanced game is not for the squeamish.  A very good look at modern operational warfare and high replay value.  Where was this in the 80's for all of those NATO-Warsaw Pact games?

RATING: 8.5
Interesting simulation of modern combat. This game has also good replayability allowed by both the different levels of preparation for all nations involved and the several initial landing points for the initial PRC assault. With all the rules it gets very long and complex but also more detailed and authentic. The basic rules/specific game rules approach allows players to easily tackle other games of the Next War series once mastered the first, but add difficulties in learning the game and checking rules during play. Game Specific Rules could have been written better

The premier modern operational system. There is so much variety packed in the box, beginning with Standard and Advanced rule sets, with multiple scenarios for each. The individual scenarios can be further tailored through the use of varying levels of international involvement and tons of optional rules. The naval and aerial systems can also be customized, to the point that they nearly become games within themselves. The single map keeps the game manageable, but offers many variations thanks to the choice of many landing beaches for use be the Chinese. Chrome includes electronic warfare, cruise missiles, special forces, and more. A lot of game here folks.

RATING: 9
Both the PRC and ROC have a tough fight ahead of them. The PRC must retain control of the inshore and at sea boxes to perform amphibious assaults and remain in supply, whilst the PRC cruise missiles can delay the arrival of USN forces for some turns. The ROC have few good ER units, but the PRC initially have very small battalions and eventually one regiment with limited combat value due to its size.

The game is simultaneously a race and a delaying action: The USN and USAF racing into Taiwan to achieve sea control and air superiority, whilst the PRC try to destroy as many ROC defenders to present a [i]fait accompli[/i] to the US. The defenders are mostly static, though there may be a few foolhardy attacks on exposed beachheads, the ROC doesn't have the combat power to force PRC marines who have amphibiously landed to leave the island. Strangely, the ROC's ageing green water submarines will play relatively little part in the conflict, being confined to a single DRM for sea control.

Eventually the PRC must contend with USN and USAF air supremacy and consider how it will affect their amphibious and sea transport operations. Once the PRC are cut off from the PRC mainland, they are subject to isolation and surrender.

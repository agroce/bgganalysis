If I was guaranteed an opponent this would be my desert island game. Absolutely fantastic game. The two forces have completely different strengths and need completely different styles when playing. The French can usually steam ahead in the first few years of the game but if the British can avoid a French auto victory the finish will usually be very tight. Playing the right card at the right time is crucial. Well done Mr.Ruhnke. A modern classic.

This is a very good and deep wargame that needs several plays before you start to get a decent strategic grasp of it and at least 2 before the rules start to fully sink in.

It is a third cousin (no closer than that) of Hannibal but is not as dynamic as that game.  Having said that, it's just as subtle and contains as many intricacies. 

I disagree with those who say that it's easier to play the British.  As an experienced grognard, I found it much easier to play the French.  You get more choices, don't have to spend half of your time closing gaps and parrying, can use your cards more effectively and can be sneakier.  The British have their superior strength, but they are like an juggernaut trying to lumber through the narrow pathways of the wilderness, whilst the French can be like mosquitoes or hit-and-run raiders and can strike quicker and more unpredictably.

The card plays are interesting and luck doesn't play too high a part in the game.  There's lots going on, lots to think about and lots to wonder about after each game...all that's got to be very positive in a game.

This is quite a hard game to get a grip of the first few times that you play it. What you need to do is not always as obvious as it is in many other wargames. The whole system with the Indians is almost like a sub-plot to what's going on, but it's a plot that handled well, can win you the game.

Good Points
It's full of the flavour of a very unusual (in gaming terms) war.
Relatively simple rules to learn.
Lots of things to do on your turn (sometimes it's very hard to choose what to do)
The leaders are very well done and add a lot of replayability
There are various areas of the board that are vital and each one of them can win or lose you the game. Sometimes you have to denude one to strengthen another, which can be very edgy.
An unpredictable move always seems likely from the Indians, whilst the armies tend to offer you a more static and slow burning strategy.
Great on ACTS
A few different game lengths and additional rules which you can throw in to keep it fresh.

I really like the mechanics and the history in this game.  The game works as a competitve game of victory points, but there is not really a threat that the French are going to take Philadelphia, New York, or Boston.
As far as a game goes, it is very fun and both sides have to learn to maximize their strengths, because both sides are unbalanced.  Having a common deck is a big plus, so you don't have to deal with deck management.

RATING: 9
Surely this is the case with any good wargame, but for me it’s been amplified with WW: The more I play, the more the richness of nuance and strategic depth reveal themselves –- to the point when I’m playing a Vassal game, I’ll catch myself staring at the board for a half-hour examining the river system, geography, where I need to be to execute and/or prevent raids. If I have enough resources to build *way out there*, and if I do, will I have a prayer to hold the supply line . . .

There’s so much to like here: the many different unit-type capabilities, Br/Fr asymmetry, political backdrop and consequences of fighting, and chess-like maneuver and positioning mixed with chaos.  Montcalm and Wolfe are hammers, but use them too much and sooner or later they won’t be around to bring to the party. 

The components and map are first-rate, the rules concise and clear, and the gameplay taut. In the classic ops/event CDG lineage, it’s hard to find any fault with WW.

Excellent game> The different units and movement options make the game very interesting and challenging. Auxiliary units play a crucial role. Interception and infiltration are two major aspects that render the game somehow unpredictable. The construction phase and the supply line check is a major contribution to make the game not just a war game but also a more strategical game in terms of area control and so on. The actions that can be performed with the cards are really few and thus they are easy to memorize all to the benefit of the game. It is easy to learn but very challenging. Highly recommended, especially the deluxe version with the mounted map.

Excellent 2-player strategy game about the English/French war theater on the American continent. Top notch components from GMT, well designed assymetrical game from Mr. Ruhnke and one of the best heavier 2-player only games! Highly recommended as a CDG and of course not only for that! The only disadvantage that I can think of is that it lasts too long if you play the two campaigns but has a very nicely balanced scenario that is completed in only 2-3 hours.

War Card Driven
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I find Wilderness War (WW) reminiscent of Hannibal: Rome v Carthage in more than the cards that drive it.  Like the Carthaginians, the French start with one outstanding general (Montcalm).  Like the Romans, the Brits bumble along with a collection of mediocre ones while awaiting their Scipio Africanus (Wolfe).  Both games combine a low counter density with the slings and arrows of a card driven game to give a wide open feel.    

While Hannibal's rules fill more pages, WW feels the slightly more complex game.  The most notable complication is the distinction between drilled troops and auxiliaries.  The two types are well differentiated in terms of both movement and combat.  The powerful drilled troops are excellent in a siege and in set piece battles, yet vulnerable in the wilderness to brutal winter attrition and to retreat rules that penalise the absence of somewhere civilised to run back to. The French must make the most of their advantage in numbers of auxiliairies, whose main use is to raid those civilised places.   

WW is a game of calculated risks.  In battle the range of CRT results and the cards that can be played  keep the outcome uncertain.  Add to that some tough decisions about how much can be achieved, particularly when winter is approaching.  

A weak point of the WW design is its reliance on card draws to determine reinforcements. The rate at which the  British regulars arrive and the timing of Wolfe's appearance can have a substantial impact on the course of the game.  Playing the British in the Early War scenario, I drew no regulars cards until the start of the third year, and then my hand had three of them. If that had been my start hand, the French would have been in deep trouble. 

Overall, I like WW quite a bit. It has a good feel of its era and its terrain. It is asymmetrical with a shifting momentum from the French to the Brits as time passes.  It offers both sides different challenges in different parts of the map.

I own the third edition of WW.  Prodution quality is to GMT's best standards, with a sturdy box and a mounted board.  The artwork is quite pleasing, though maybe it is just me, but river routes kept escaping my notice.

Another good CDG. With no political control markers, quite different from some others: different unit types, raiding, wilderness and cultivated terrain all give this game its own unique character. Definitely one I want to come back to, and I could see my rating going up.

For two new players, the 3 turn tournament scenarios took us nearly 6 hours including setup (probably just over five hours of play), so I'd be cautious about attempting the longer scenarios.

I dislike that the French player is just hosed if he/she doesn't draw the "Regulars" card.  That is my only problem with the game.  Does a good job of creating a "wilderness" feel with the need for stockades, use of river movement, dramatic slowing effect of wilderness/mountains.  Edit: after recent enjoyment of Twilight Struggle I think I would like to revisit this game.  I expect my rating to improve.  My rationale: my only peeve with the game is/was randomness, something TS has in spades.

This might be the best of the 2-player card-driven wargames.  Complexity isn't that much higher than We the People, but that by no means diminishes the breadth and depth of decisions you have to make.  Also, the French and British both play very differently enhancing the replayability.

First Impressions: The asymmetry in this game is mostly highlighted by the troop composition, victory objectives, and cards. The game provides the situation of the conflict without being scripted, despite the CDG mechanism. With the various methods of acquiring VPs, this feels open-ended and almost like a sand-box game. The more I play it, the better it gets.

The game is remarkable in how it replicates the seasonal campaigning of the age while managing to be fun and quick playing. The game should be played  using all of the advanced rules. 

Excellent support by the designer and developer on Consimworld.

The French have it tough in the tournament game.  They need to outlast the British mass.  Goal is to get way ahead on VP's then survive to the end.  This game is great for someone desiring a shorter duration Wargame that doesn't mind a little luck eliment through the card play.  Understanding the map and cards are crucial.  First game is usually a learning curve.  Play for the tournament scenario is typically 2 1/2 to 3 hours.

Wilderness War is an interesting game and utilizes the CDG engine well.  

I find it to be more complex than Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage, Twilight Struggle, 1989 or Labyrinth and is more of a traditional wargame.  It does not utilize the "standard" CDG political control marker system.  Instead, players are awarded victory points for winning battles and for capturing fortifications or raiding stockades.  

While the rule book is well written, there are a number of "little" rules that were hard for me to remember and to find.  

The play book is packed with interesting and helpful information.  

Overall, I think Wilderness War is an excellent game but it hits the table less often that my favourite CDGs.

Good fun on a little-gamed subject.  A nice balance of chrome and simplicity in an unusual strategic/ operational situation.  I've had a few French wins early, which was a nice gaming treat, but am satisfied that the game mirrors the history very well, with enough variability to look forward to starting each new sitting.

Late update -- trivia note.  This may be the ONLY CDG I've played where the single, shared deck choice seems acceptable to me, or at least, doesn't seem nearly as onerous as the frustrations it generates in other games.  I have a tendency to get many draws that are often "perfect if they were for the other side" in single deck games (maybe everyone does!).  But it is less chafing here in WW, I don't know why.  

I do know that unfortunately, for the French chances, if they get several of these type draws early, their chances evaporte quickly.  The Fr absolutely need most of their "Regulars" reinf cards to hit, in their own hand, in 55-57.  Because of the preponderence of quality Brit Reinf cards, even if the Brits get several sparse hands, sheer numbers ensure they will still get enough bodies sooner or later (usually sooner) to create the overwhelming 2 or 3 to one sp advantages in "east" and "west" theaters to bludgeon through to the French forts/fortresses.

Somewhat "fixed" strategy for the British and French. Once you get the hang of it, and it will take a few plays, the game tends to feel repetitive. Often there is lack of clarity in the rules explanations which can cause confusion. Also, the layout of the rules is confusing at times. 

Overall, this is a good game that could be even better with the proper rules' clarifications.

GMT CDG covering the French-Indian Wars in North America. A period little covered in gaming pits the French against the British with both regular and miltia troops, as well as Indian allies on both sides, in skirmishes, raids and the odd pitched battle. Very atmospheric as most CDGs are able to be via the cards and game mechanics in general. Two player; longer than We the People and Hannibal, but shorter than Paths of Glory, For the People and WWII, Barbarossa to Berlin. The card deck design has issues regarding troop reinforcement and replacements that prevent it from occupying the dizzying heights achieved Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage, but it is a worthy title in the series.

Just got this in a trade.  Currently I'm reading the rules and can't wait to give it a try.

Initial rating a 7 after one FtF play.  I really like how different the two sides of this game play.  The British are looking for stand up fights with their larger amount of regular army type troops.  On the other hand the French are engaged in a campaign of skirmishing and raiding with a combination of irregulars and indian forces.

I'm bumping my rating to an 8 after a few more games via VASSAL.  The more experienced player should tackle the French as their paths to victory aren't as obvious.  A real gem of the CDG genre.

Juego ambientado en la guerra Franco-Indica, en el norte de América.  Es un wargame y no de los ligeritos. Tiene un reglamento intenso... por lo que se aconseja jugar asesorado (al menos la primera partida). Los Franceses deben conseguir 11 puntos de victoria (empiezan con 5) antes de que los Ingleses se hagan demasiado fuertes. 
Hay asedios, empalizadas, fortalezas, colabaroación con los indidos, limitaciones varias al movimiento. El juego está llevado principalmente por un motor de cartas. Cada carta puede usarse como evento o para activar tropas (bien por fuerza (un líder y las tropas bajo su mando, incluyendo otros líderes subordinados) o bien individualmente.

El juego está bien, pero al principio puede resultar un poco confuso.

RATING: 8
Very preliminary ranking. Please take the following comments somewhat with a grain of salt. 

I am in the early learning stage of this game. As such, and given its sometimes unique (for me) mechanics, I am in a bit of a quandry about it. 

On the one hand, I am enjoying the history lesson it is giving me about the Seven Years War in NA and also the geography lesson. Unit types are differentiated by ability. The difficulties of moving European trained troops in the boonies is here as are sieges and pitched battles. Supply is very important. It feels like 18th century warfare.

Oddly enough, this is also a bit of a problem with the game. Or at least with learning the game. Those unit nuances are fascinating, but also help to make it difficult for the new player to determine just how to go about playing the game. Moving and supplying those troops can be a labourious process, which can give the session a rather plodding pace. Again, especially for a newbie. 

I suspect that this is a game whose qualities will emerge the more one plays it. The trick is to get over that learning hump. Not that it is a difficult game per se, but rather that it is a bit of an odd duck. I also suspect that it may really shine in the campaign game, which is contrary to what others have mentioned. The AM scenario, although picture perfect for showing the sides in their asymmetric glory, is still a bit of a British glacier slowing crushing all in its path. I am concerned that the glacier is only stoppable should the French, by happenstance, have the right cards in their hands. If that is the case, it would be a pretty strong strike against the AM scenario.

PROS: Early days yet, but I am liking the depiction of the time period and the situation. It feels right.

CONS: Early days again, but I think that this game will potentially turn off players after their first session due to its nuances and generally slow play. Some concern over the luck of the draw.

More experience required. Rating will change no doubt.

What makes the difference between an absolute classic game like Hannibal and a pretty good but somewhat limited replay value game like Wilderness War? Hard to say, as it seems that the truly great games are hard to quantify. For Wilderness War, though, I think it's just a collection of little, irritating details: a little too much chrome that has too little effect (light troops, militias); a few elements that are way to random for too little payoff (leader death); a few too many rules; some imbalance which leads to a lack of real tension; not quite enough historical flavor; and a card deck that is much too chaotic. I think that last one is where Wilderness War really stumbles; for a game as complex as it is, the turn of the card adds a huge randomness to the game, which can sometimes kill the tension when you realize that the card you draw may well overwhelm good play. For this reason, the AM scenario is really the only good one; in the longer games, the luck of the draw is amplified even further.

Anyway, Wilderness War is a good game which I enjoyed out of the box and is a good diversion and solid gaming investment. I'm glad I have it, and I'm not selling it, at least not yet. For fans of the card-driven wargames who aren't too complexity-averse, this is worth checking out - it kept me amused for 5-10 games. The replay value just doesn't seem quite what you'd hope, so don't let it slow down your acquisition of Hannibal or Paths of Glory :)

RATING: 6.5
The combination of conventional warfare and raiding activity is unusual and requires some experience to master. The relative "fiddliness" of the various units' characteristics also sets WW above the complexity of Hannibal (though at least the developer argues otherwise). I find it in terms of complexity more in the Shifting Sands, Unhappy King Charles and Thirty Years War range (i.e. below PoG, but more complex than Hannibal, Age of Napoleon, Twilight Struggle and - of course - We the People).

PROS:- good simulation of 18th century conventional and irregular warfare in the Americas
- engaging and sound logistical system
- well-balanced tournament scenario

CONS:
- insufficient playtesting (balance issues) of the full campaign (1755-62)
- no out-of-the-box scenario covering the historical campaign (1755-60)
- little relationship between the military situation and political affairs (unlike PoG, FtP, HRC, etc).
- potentially overpowering card luck. WW includes some overwhelmingly powerful cards (far more so than FtP, PoG, HRC, TS etc. I would argue), which can turn the game. Less of an issue for the tournament scenario, this really can clobber a player in the longer scenarios (balance issue).
- the only really balanced scenario (AM) usually fails to cover the epic decisive campaign in French Canada. Arguably one of the highlights of the whole war. I tend to feel a 1759 ending doesn't quite satisfy my appetite. Late 1760 ought to IMO be the climactic end to campaigning - either resulting in French surrender or (in game terms, having outperformed history) French victory.
- Louisbourg axis of advance pretty much plays itself, all depending on the cards. By comparison, I find Malta in Shifting Sands is handled more effectively.

BOTTOM LINE:A fine design which accomplishes what the designer set out to do. I find the game suffers from various issues noted above, but I nonetheless rather admire and enjoy this game. Yet for the reasons mentioned I fear it falls somewhat short of the true greatness of a Hannibal, Twilight Struggle and (leaving its glaring historical issues aside) Paths of Glory.

RATING: 7
Rating based on 3 plays. I'm curious how this one will compare to Hannibal and Shifting Sands in the long run. After one play each, I'm more intrigued by Wilderness War than Hannibal, but that may be simply because Wilderness War's theme appeals to me more. Or, it may be because I was more familiar with the basic system when I played Wilderness War, having played Hannibal first.

UPDATE: I've played both WW and H:RvC several more times. H:RvC is the better game, although not by a large margin, but this one has a more engrossing theme.

RATING: 5
5+ plays with 2 players
5+ plays solo

A good CDG, but its rating gets docked a point due to the fiddly, nuisance-filled rules (which seem more straight forward in reading then they are in practice).  Missed a rule in each of the first five games played - hell I'm probably still miss something.

That having been said, once you internalize the rules, the game plays well.  It is very evocative of its historical milieu and casts the players in their respective roles well.  And the card choices ... delicious.

Personally, I play the French and their native allies which in my opinion is the most challenging.  The cards drawn in the first year of any scenario, particularly my favorite scenario The Early War, can cast the game very differently.  Woe be to the French player who doesn't draw Montcalm in the first year, miss again in the second and there is no way you can win against competent British play.

The game is like that - at times a joy to play but a streak of bad card draws can decide the game, or feel like it does at any rate.

Update: Docking the game's rating

This game's core weakness is that despite the unique situation, the two sides basically have a single strategic approach a piece.  The French have to raid successfully early in the game to win - period.  And let's face it there isn't much the British can do to stop them in the early game, so French success comes down to the dice.  Once the opportunities for raiding have dwindled as the British situation stabilizes, their forces are built up and pressing forward ... the end is inevitable.  Maybe it's us, but games all follow this pattern, and the title never sees the table anymore.

RATING: 9
After two plays, I'm intrigued and anxious to play again.  This is my next step towards grognard-dom, and it's a very enjoyable one.  Coming from War of the Ring was a fairly natural progression, as there are many similarities between the two games.  The asymmetric card-driven play, with a focus by one side on being a nuisance (the French) and the other being a military powerhouse (the British) definitely reminds me of WOTR.  The rules and nature of besieging also have some similarity.  The detailed rulebooks are helpful (and the historical and strategy bits very interesting), although some of the rules were a bit fiddly.  I think that's the nature of the beast, though.  All in all, a very well done game, and I'm looking forward to getting some good mileage out of it.  Then, on to Paths of Glory!  

UPDATE:  Revisiting this game was a pleasant experience.  The optional rules really shouldn't be optional, however, as they give the French player much more leverage toward achieving victory.  Without them the game is probably a 7, while with them it raises to about a 9 in my book.

RATING: 7
Very good and playable simulation of French and Britain conflict in a Seven Years War. Easy to learn rules, assimetrical tactics and strategy, solid design. Recommended use of all optional rules to achieve balance between both sides.

RATING: 10
:tobacco: :what::D I can't really put my finger on why this is my favorite wargame, but it is. It's a combination of the right scope (strategic, regiment-level), right subject (I've always been interested in the French and Indian war since my parents got me a book with schematic diagrams of the battles of Quebec and Louisbourg, yes I was a strange kid, why do you ask), right complexity (smack dab in the middle of CDGs, with 1960 at the left end and probably Empire of the Sun at the right), right playtime (three hours for experienced players running the tournament scenario), right mechanic (I love CDGs and the mechanic makes special sense in the case of a conflict that was considered by both sides to be a sideshow to the big show), and right level of granularity (the different unit types are differentiated in interesting ways without requiring a shedload of special rules to convey those differences, likewise the generals are all different --some are frustratingly immobile, some energetically tear around the map.)

Strategically, WW depicts a war of maneuver with a significant guerilla aspect, complicated (greatly) by the difficulty of communications and supply in the vast no-man's-land. The winter attrition and retreat rules are [i]brutal[/i], and reinforcements can only be added to the board by the play of events, and every event you play is a maneuver you don't make. Losses, therefore, are really [i]losses[/i], and the CRT doesn't cut you any breaks in that regard. Most of the time, you'll want to move deliberately and cover your retreats by building stockades. Knowing when to say eff it and gamble is part of the strategy of the game. There are three main theaters on the board (the overland approaches to Ohio Forks, the Mohawk Valley, and the Hudson-Champlain route), plus maybe something interesting to be done in the Connecticut Valley, as well as the showdown between the potential invasion force stationed at Halifax and the garrison at L'Bourg, which is practically a game within the game. You have to be pressing on at least two of these at the same time to really make gains, especially as the Brits -- Montcalm is basically the Terminator, capable of swinging battles by himself and dodging fights with relative ease when the odds are against him, but he can't be everywhere at once. Long haul, France starts with the whip hand with better generals, more and better raiders, and the advantage of the strategic defensive, but lacks the manpower to overcome the greater number of British reinforcements, especially since those British reinforcements are going to ultimately bring up the generals that are worth a tinker's cuss.

All of this mechanical pressing and holding back would be for naught if the game didn't tell an interesting story. Fortunately, it does. It manages to even be fun as a solo exercise, trying to figure out the best move to make in a given situation, which is especially remarkable as it wasn't designed with solo play in mind.

This is an oddball personal affection for sure, but I just adore playing this game and wish I got it to the table more often.

Superb game.  It exudes the French and Indian War somewhat painlessly (need a couple of plays), particularly the feel for early guerilla warfare versus traditional warfare.  Its challenging and tense.  Card draws are important so bad luck might be devastating; but I can get over it.
It compliments Friedrich well.

RATING: 7
I love the card-driven system in games, generally. I like the assymetric set-up here...and the theme is very engaging. The components are attractive and help to draw you into the game. 

One of the neatest things about Wilderness War is the way in which different units serve different functions. The French must use their superior maneuverability in the wild to threaten key positions and avoid the big head-on engagements with superior British forces. (Note, I've only played with the advanced rules.) 

I usually prefer the CDG games with individual decks that you can manage as part of your strategy. Perhaps that's a bit 'gamey', but it also seems to mitigate the luck of the draw somewhat. It seems like Wilderness War is more prone to wild swings depending on card draws...but I haven't played enough to see if that is really true.

Great Game, great prodution value, well written rulebook, interesting and not so known topic (at least in Europe). Played more than 40 games and growing. The games are tense and bitterly fought to the last die roll. Wish there were more games like this.
 You MUST use the "optional" rules given in the rulebook. If you are playing the Campaign Game and want to reduce the amount of luck in card drawing you are strongly adviced to use the other optionals you find in the internet.

_Excellent_ wargame about a subject I thought wasn't very interesting until I played the game and saw a lot of the tactical issues and situations.  It's a little more complex than everyone makes it out to be, but that being said the card-driven mechanics are pretty easy to grasp- it's the exceptions and minutiae that get a little hazy. I wish it had a mounted board as my map already shows signs of wear. Definitely a game I want to play often!

Perhaps the best developed wargame (that hasn't gone through repeated editions of rules, such as OCS) out there. Imagine a CDG with *no* card errata. Tainted only by a longish campaign game that too often goes to the British a little early (although I've done well with the French in the past). The tournament game is fun for the Brits, but historically the French were done in North America and just didn't know it yet. Also, too much hinges on the right cards in the British hand to take Louisbourg. Otherwise, a brilliant game on a neglected subject, and a model for wargame developers to aim for.

Played once so far--Annus Mirabalis scenario as the British. French win. 

This game really encourages players to build fortifications (stockades or forts) as their forces advance. The retreat rule and winter attrition rules are painful if they're not in a fortification of some sort. The cool part is these fortifications also offer victory points to your opponent if they capture them. So there's a lovely trade-off here. 

I made two unsuccessful attempts to amphibious movement to assault the French fortress at Louisburg. That was a painful lesson as well. Next time, I'll reinforce the army at Halifax more before the naval move. Louisburg is a tough nut to crack, so you really need overwhelming odds.

The British leaders are crap compared to the French. It almost feels like playing Rome in Hannibal: RvC as you don't have as much control over which leaders are in play (and the majority of them require so many resources/logistics in order to get them to do something!) Montcalm is the Hannibal of the French and Indian war. :)

But, the British have greater potential numbers of regular drilled troop reinforcements from which to draw. And perhaps higher overall command activation limits on their leaders, but I'm not sure on that.

Some things are within your control, and some are beyond it. This game gets it right. While agonizing over whether to push (or defend) in the Ohio Valley, on the Mohawk, at Champlain, or the Maritime provinces, or suffering the relative indifference of the powers-that-be in Paris or London, it will hit you -- this is *exactly* what the Commanders in the New World dealt with.

RATING: 7
Relatively quick for a wargame (3-4 hours) and fun.  After playing the tournament scenario a few times now, it seems to have just enough to keep it interesting without getting too bogged down.  The smaller deck size, along with limited 1-3 ops, keeps the chaos to a reasonable level.

Although I enjoy the game from time to time, I think the timing of the British reinforcements will largely dicatate the pace and direction  (and possibly outcome) of the game among experienced players. Plus, the overall strategies that either player can take are somewhat limited. Fortunately, the execution of those strategies is where it gets interesting.

Ultimately, the overall replayability of the game is somewhat limited, at least for the Annis Mirabilis scenario. This is a game good for 1-2 plays per year, max, though that's not bad. I can't comment on the grand campaign, but I've heard it doesn't work very well and I'm not sure the game could sustain its playing time anyway.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Despite the short and clear rules, they're very "fiddly" and exception ridden. The rules for drilled troops through wilderness simulate well the main avenues of advance and the ability to outflank a blocking force with risk and time. Fun, fast playing and thought provoking.

Another great card driven wargame that plays very differently from the other ones I've tried. 

The French start out in a good position but the British keep getting reinforcements so it comes down to if the French can gain enough points at start to stop a British blow-out in the end.

I really like this game and it plays quite fast, around 3 hours or less for the tournament scenario.

After many years of owning this, I finally got to play a game!   I liked it, but can't help but feel there are some things a little off-kilter.  No stacking limit seems crazy.  Granted it is my first play, but I'm not sure what's to keep both players from massing huge armies.  For instance, with boat movement, Montcalm can zip back and forth between Quebec and the central river with everyone in tow.  If the Brits split their forces say between the two, they will lose battles and VPs.  I think it is a must for the Brits to attack in the west...a must..otherwise the entire French force commanded by Montacalm can defend two fronts.

I think the designers were worried about this but the fixes (Schooner's and Pox) are not enough incentive to keep from massing.  It's just a matter of who will draw what.

There is a good bit of randomness that feels very hard to mitigate...from raids and combat to the all important..who draws what card.  For instance, if the Brits down draw reinforcements, I'm not sure how they would win.  The card draw just seems really important in this one.

Still, it is a fun game I hope to play again soon to test some more strategies.

This game has a lot of good things going for it, not the least being a terrific subject - The French and Indian Wars of the 1750’s. Furthermore, the scenario is very interesting - the outnumbered French versus the powerful British. However, it just doesn’t gel. Fiddly rules that could have been greatly simplified if the troop types were more generic. I’m sorry to say this was the first &quot;card based wargame&quot; to hit the trade pile.

This seems to be the best CDG since Hannibal. The under-powered French are on the defensive against the British colonies here. But the French have great leaders and Coureurs des Bois to raid the British colonists. Also they have powerful Indian allies as well, so it can be a bug-hunt for the Brits under certain circumstances. Looks like lots of replay here, looking forward to more play!

It both accurately reflects the historical situation and also allows players to explore a number of strategic options.  Another game the benefits from repeating playing, and which stands up to it well.
  And, with experienced players, even the full campaign is balanced evenly.  With newbies, play the &quot;AM&quot; scenario and spot the French one more VP.

RATING: 10
Three games in and this is fast becoming my favourite CDG. It has a few things going in its favour. 1. It seems to be remarkably well balanced. I still think it perhaps favours the Brits 55-45% if only because they have some obvious strategies available to them. But with more plays there are some solid french counters and things seem to open up more. 2. as stated, this is a game that opens up rather than closes down with more play. For me this is the real indication of a gem of game. 3. of the ligher CDGs and block games, this might be the best at its history. In broad strokes it does a pretty good job of facing you with the problems Wolfe or Moncalm faced. It is perhaps a little light on the interfactional politics, but it is a two player game. 3. it plays in 2.5-3 hours well and has a rule set with very few exceptions or easy to forget situations, consequently it plays really well at the pub with a few beers.

All in all, im really liking my time with this game, best light game i've played in some time.
----------------------
Initial rating after one play of the 3 year scenario. This is one of the best CDGs, possibly the best in its class. It is essentially the same complexity as Hannibal Rome v Carthage with a few extra chrome rules and unit types. The tournament scenario clocks in at 2.5 hours. This is a game with clear strategic decision points. The kind that define the best strategic war games. Do you build a heavy defense around the Hudson river or give ground and stretch your opponents supply lines? Where do you put your best general? How much do you invest in raids. Then it has the usual gammit of card driven tactics on the turn by turn basis. It is a very tense game that allows you the could have beens after the event.

Excellent, excellent, excellent historical game - one of the best of the card-driven wargames. You wouldn't think it from the theme at first, but this game can be more gripping and tense than many world war II simulations.

By now, if you haven't yet tried card-driven games you are missing out on certainly one of the most exciting gaming innovations of the last 10 years.  This one is an excellent example, not quite as perfect as Hannibal vs Rome, not quite as monstrous as Paths of Glory.  

I've just finished reading 'L'histoire populaire du Québec' by Jacques Lacoursière (fine read if you read french) which details the origins of the conflict covered by this game.  So the adaptation is particularly appreciated; the genre fits the theme perfectly.  The choices are many and difficult to make; the opportunities and turnarounds abound although the cards don't always cooperate.  The randomness is present in many forms but does not drive the play itself.  It affects the outcome, but you remain in the driver's seat.  Play the Tournament scenario (Annis Miraculis) and have buckets of tension and fun.

May end up a '10'.  I like any wargame where I get to play the French, regardless of the period.  Lots of rules and unit types to learn and requires a learning game for the first play to get it all together.  However it plays quickly and has plenty of interesting chrome, events and depth.  This rating is for the tournament scenario.  I read Crucible of War to get into the historical period (and watched The Last of the Mohicans just for effect) and found the game offers up a great feel for the actual events.  I like how quickly it plays and I really like the simplicity of one deck CDGs.

If you've played Friedrich,  Wilderness War is covers what was happening in North America while Friedrich the Great was fighting in Europe.  Two very different approaches to the same time period.



Can't wait for more plays!

A nice card-driven game. The luck with cards seems to be very unbalacing  sometimes (if other player gets lots of reinforcements and you get none, there is little you can do) it still plays nicely most of the times. The "Annus Mirabilis" scenario can be played in 3 hours, which is a big plus. Explaining the rules to a new player seems to take forever, however. There are lots of rules but they create the framework for the asymmetric fighting.

Beautiful counters, map and cards. Quite a solid design, well-earned reputation as one of the best Card Driven Wargames. Asymmetry concerning sides is well managed, so balance seems not to be an issue here. The flow of the game is smooth, no complex phases nor tables must be checked. Anyway at first sight the limited nature of strategies (blame the conflict rather than the designer) suggests replayability could be somehow limited.

Main scenario could last as much as 4 hours.

Middle of the road as far as CDGs go.  The newest GMT edition is a lovely production with a mounted board and thick cards.  The rules feel very similar to Hannibal and you can tell there is a pedigree here.  The inclusion of a fast tournament scenario is great as is the really assymetric game play.  Not one of the great CDGs, but still well worth playing and owning.

The landscape of this war meant that it would have to be fought very differently than the "conventional" European wars of the age. This game conveys that non-conventional style nicely. The two sides have an asymtric playing style. The unit mix abilities is very interesting. It's fun to try out both sides.

This game must be played more than once to appreciate it's subtleties. Expect to make big mistakes the first couple of playings.  It has a great joy-of-discovery learning curve.

One of my favorite card-driven games.  It's on the lighter end of the weight spectrum, but that's how I like it these days: clean, elegant mechanics that get the job done.  My favorite thing about the game is the asymmetry between the two sides: the British in their drilled troops and the French in their irregulars.  The unit differentiation and the way they interact with the terrain is marvelous.  Furthermore, both sides get the chance to attack, so neither has to be the punching bag for the entire game.

CDG sympa sur un sujet peu couvert. Le seul problème est la gestion des cartes Pitt et révolution diplomatique dans le scenario 1755.

This is a superb way to understand this forgotten but dramatic war. Few games balance history and playability as well as this one. I love how the different units interact within the game system; it really illustrates the strengths and weaknesses of each type of soldier. The cards lack a bit of variety, and I wish there was a card for Washington, but these are minor quibbles.

RATING: 4
Wilderness War is a decent game with a beautiful map and clearly-written rules, but I found it to me too much bother for what little enjoyment I got out of it.  I prefer less emphasis on historicity and more emphasis on gameplay.  There's just too much chrome, such as the seven types of troops and their subtle differences.  The game lacked clarity, because we got too bogged down in the intricacies of the troop types, the movement, the raiding, and the fortifications.  I'd rather play a "cleaner" cdg such as Hannibal (or more recently, Twilight Struggle.)

Another area in which Wilderness War suffers compared to Hannibal is the luck factor.  The combat system is extremely swing-y, with a bad die roll leading to catastrophe including the possible loss of an important leader.  The cards themselves vary immensely in power.  For example, the British begin (in the tournament scenario) with all their generals except one having an extremely unwieldy initiative rating of 3.  There's one leader with an initiative of 1, but he can only command three units.  So for the British player to make any progress, he has to get one of his better leaders on the board quickly.  There are six cards in the deck that allow this to happen.  If the British player doesn't draw one of those in the first year, he's cooked.  And if the French player draws Colonial Politics and plays it in the first round, some of those six cards become unplayable!

Overall, I'm not sure whether the cdg format is a good choice for an operational level game like this one.  The system was designed to simulate broad strategic decisionmaking with an emphasis on politics, popular support, current events, and leadership.  A game like Wilderness War with its emphasis on varied unit types, forts, raiding, and methodical troop advancements doesn't really play to the strengths of the system.

With apologies to Kenny Rodgers: 

You got to know when to raid 'em
Know when to siege 'em
Know when to infiltrate
Know when to run
You never count your VPs while you're still in Early Season
There'll be time enough for counting when the year is done.

Best of the CDGs but still some curious choices and ommisions.

There is a discussion initiated by a very experienced WW player who has conducted online tournaments and who GMs at the WBC of his perceived game imbalance and his suggested House Rules that starts on 11 November, 2009 in the WW folder on Consimworld. He expresses some different concerns than mine but there are references to the "Death Star" issue.

1) Issue: The "Surrender!" card performs the identical function of the "Truce" card in Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage, it causes a reshuffle even if not played as the Event. This is fine since it disrupts card counting which is the intention for this kind of mechanism but the supplemental rule which handles cases where the "Surrender!" card has not appeared and not enough cards remain for a full hand to be dealt calls for the distribution of those remaining unplayed cards and then filling the hand with the reshuffled previously played cards. This allows each player to know EXACTLY which previously undealt cards are held by the opponent and thwarts the "Surrender!" card reshuffle mechanism. In the so called "2nd Edition" Rules for Hannibal this flaw was remedied so that any remaining cards in the Draw Pile are reshuffled in with the previously played cards and all are then used for the new hands.

Fix: The obvious method from Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage cited above.


2) Issue: The huge stacks of Regulars that freely roam the Wilderness which are frequently referred to as "Death Stars" or "Panzer Gruppe Montcalm" or such.

Fix: (These rules only apply to movement in Wilderness/Mountain spaces without a friendly fortification. In Cultivated Spaces, whether those spaces are friendly _or_ enemy, normal multi-leader led forces are permitted per the standard rules.) Only the number of units controllable by the Commanding leader may be activated as a force to either start movement or _enter_ a Wilderness/Mountain space that does not contain a friendly fortification. Other equal/lower ranked leaders may accompany the force (any such supernumerary leaders _would_ be subject to leader loss die rolls). On Defense this rule means that any units present in the (non-friendly fortification Wildereness/Mountain) defending space which are in excess of the same maximum command limitation will cause any Tactical modifier to be voided, that is if Montcalm is defending in a Wilderness/Mountain space with 7 or more French units [even (0-6) Aux units count] Montcalm's DRM will not be in effect even if there are other leaders whose Command Rank would account for the excess number of units. An equal/lower ranked leader (with his own subordinate attached, if available) can still be activated from within a larger stack to move/intercept/avoid with his own maximum number of units. This change makes those 3-7/0 DRM British Army Leaders more individually useful and avoids the unrealistic Super Stacks of units commanded by 4 Command level leaders accompanied by multiple subordinates while an actual Theatre of Operations commander like Abercrombie or Loudoun languishes at a Fortress or minor outpost. It may also make the historical "Louisboug Siege followed by Amphibious attack at Quebec" strategy more attractive since it can be used for a large multi-leader led force. 

3) Issue: Forces can never add units (pick up additional units/leaders) during an activated move.

Fix: Once during its activation a moving force may spend one additional MP (either land or boat) to pick up units/leaders up to the capacity of control by the activated leader from a space if there is no leader present or if all other leaders in that space are lesser ranked than the activated Commanding leader. No units/leaders which have previously been activated and/or moved during that activation phase may be picked up by such a moving force. Individually activated units cannot make such a pick-up.


4) Issue: The loss of all Drilled units which are forced to retreat to a wilderness/mountain space that does not contain a friendly fortification is excessively severe.

Fix: After normal combat losses are assessed the subsequent retreat in wilderness/mountain space is treated like Winter Attrition with the exception that if it is a single reduced drilled unit which is forced to retreat it _is_ eliminated.


5) Issue: The Siege Rules permit any single (non-Indian) unit, not just a Drilled unit, but even a Coureurs des Bois or Ranger and even at the reduced strength of 0 in the case of the CdB, to maintain the siege of a fort or fortress over the Winter Interphase regardless of the number or strength of enemy units occupying the fortification. I have questioned this rule on Consimworld and been assured by the designer that it plays as intended and is historically plausible but I think it is ludicrous to believe that a dozen fur trappers are capable of holding the Greater Albany Area (or for that matter Boston or New York) hostage while thousands of Regular and Provincial  troops are holed up there and forced to suffer attrition.

Fix: Require any unit/force which attempts to maintain a siege over Winter to have at least half the strength points (rounded down) of the total number in the fort or fortress (so that a 0 strength unit could still siege a 1 strength unit). Failing to have the 1:2 Ratio at the time of Interphase would cause the sieging unit/force to withdraw one space as if it had lost a battle and suffer any normal Retreat Penalties that would apply.


6) Issue: 100% assured foreknowledge of the last game turn ending precisely on a Late Season prior to application of Winter Attrition/Going Home effects leads to a "slash-and-burn" attitude toward Drilled units left in the Wilderness which, if there was an unexpected delay in the cessation of hostilities would be decimated by Winter Attrition and then be easy pickings as additional VPs in the Spring.

Fix: The last "Late Season" game turn in the Annus Mirabilis scenario is subject to being extended by one more "Early Season" on a d6 roll of 5-6 made at the end of the scenario defined last turn; Winter Attrition and Going Home effects are applied normally if the additional Early Season turn occurs. No Raids in the added "Early Season" score points since there is no follow through to another Late Season but normal points for battles and capture/destruction of stockades, forts and fortresses are added to the final score and can cause an Auto Victory. 

If playing the Full Campaign game add a "Sudden End/Prolonged Hostilities" possibility by using 2d6 with an ascending roll ending the game after an Early or Late season starting with a roll of 2 ending the game after the Early Season 1760 (no successful Raids score), then roll again at the end of Late Season 1760 where the game would end on a 3 or less and so on with a roll of 4 or less ending the game after Early Season 1761 and continue until the roll at the end of the (added) Late Season 1764; if a 12 is rolled the game ends at the end of Early Season 1765 (assuming the normal Sudden Death Victory conditions have not ended it).

YMMV


Notes on Going Home:

There are two separate occasions when Indians/Leaders Go Home (Rangers/CdB if alone are only required to Go Home after a Raid).

"10.4 Regardless of the outcome of a Raid, all surviving Raiders immediately redeploy." (Note: this is the only paragraph in which the word "redeploy" is used in the Rules instead of Go Home). 

The very next sentence in the same paragraph leaps to the Late Season "Indians & Leaders Go Home" reference to rule 4.0 B.3 and where the unfortunate conflation of the two instances occurs.

The next sentence in that paragraph leaps to a reference to 4.0 B.3, "Indians must redeploy if they are not in a fortification during the Indians & Leaders Go Home Phase at the end of each year (4.0 B.3)."

asymetrical strategy game; the outnumbered French with interior lines vs. the strong British with defensive commitments across the colonies.  powerful cards add a large luck element, but lots of strategic options should equal many replays.

Luck?  Any game with dice and random card draws is going to be subject to critical luck.  I have personal experience with this game where Murphy struck with a vengence; every die roll and card draw that could have went bad went bad (Wolfe drawn late, then dies, small pox with a '6', out-rolled in combat, couriers, etc.) and I still had a chance to win on the last turn by being careful and planning for the worst.  Thus, while I might be cursed at this game, I do not believe the luck factor is out-of-hand.

With the tourney scenario, I think WW is probably the best of the two-player CDG's.  Shifting Sands is longer with less viable strategies, PoG is much longer and not an accurate simulation of WWI, ToC is too chromey, Twilight Struggle requires too much card knowledge, and EotS and FtP suck.  Haven't played Succesors or Hannibal, so I'm not including these.

Update 2011:  I think the French are disadvantaged in the tournament scenario.

Initial rating.  Seems too fiddly for what it is.  The game never develops a flow because you're always checking the rules for how far you can move or whether you can respond with a colonial militia unit or whatever.  Seems to sacrifices game play for historicity.  Will give it another shot and see if things improve.

Update 10/28/2012:

The engine of the game is driven by how many reinforcements the Brits get; if they draw too many too fast, the game is over for the French. If they don't get enough, they can't make any progress. All of this is to say nothing of the difficulty of the Brits' doing anything without lots of 3 cards and amphibious landings. Oh, and do try to draw the Surrender! card as often as possible--I highly recommend it.
Come on, guys. CDGs shouldn't have such swingy card draws built into the core system.

[2007/01/30] I finally got this to the table after about a year, with my cousin.  We were both new to the game, so there was lots of referring to rules during the game.  We didn't finish, calling the game about midway through turn 3 in the Year of Miracles scenario.

Initial impression: this is a fun game.  Most of the complexity arises from the different unit types and their effects on rules, but I kinda like having Provincials, Militia, Indians, [i]coureur des bois[/i], etc.  Generic CUs aren't as interesting.

I'm looking forward to playing it again, with a larger time window for absorbing the rules.

-Very interesting setting
-Rich in flavor; commanders, great unit mix, assymetric forces, indians...all is there
-Smooth gamelplay; eventhough rich in flavor the game is accessible, playable and replay value seems okay
-Clear rules

Minus:
-Definately missing a player aid for the optional rules and unit effects! (available as download, thanks to stefan o sullivan (sos1))
-Very minor but I would have loved to see more events and cards.
-Not a real minus but some administration aspect regarding leaders / leader boxes: watch out you administer correctly when leaders move or interferrence card is played. You easilly mixup   things and screw the game 
-Different strategies somewhat limited

First impressions are very good. Will update once I have played more. After some games I realised the strategies were rather limited and the itch to play disappeared. It is a great game but I got a good price and sold.

This CDG develops the ideas from earlier CDG's (We The People, Hannibal), adds a CRT and drops the Card-based combat, and focuses on the unbalanced French & Indian War.

The game itself is fascinating because of the shifting balance of play, (and while I cannot say that I have a good handle on all the rules yet) the interplay between the players is interesting and fun to play.

Based on one solo play I am starting this at a 7, but I fully expect to see it climb because it is a speedy enough game to play in one afternoon, with multiple secnarios of varying length, but offers a lot of replay value in terms of strategies and opportunities between the French and English players.

In the path of CDG evolution this is definitely a step up in both complexity and playing time from Hannibal, but it still incorporates all the luck of the draw inherent in a single deck CDG (and the luck can be constantly exacerbated by reshuffling forced by the 'Surrender' card). I'm not sure that the brief AM scenario is the best in the box, too much depends on how quickly the British can overrun Louisbourg and get their best generals into play, whereas the French start with their best assets on the board and all their options open. Why doesn't the standard game map provide all the generals with their own holding boxes? Not rocket science as they say. For me, rules complexity and game length put this is outside the envelope of what's sensible in a 'single decker', making it less satisfying than either Hannibal or We the People.

RATING: 9
Brilliant game. The historical situation lends itself well to the wargame treatment: asymmetrical sides with different types of troops, both of whom have interesting decisions and strategic options. But the game itself really makes the most of what's there: tons of options and tension. Can the British siege Louisbourg succesfully before winter sets in? Will the French transports arrive in time? Will the Indians cut the siege supply line?
Some comments say the room for manouevre is limited to only a few avenues, and it's certainly true that forces do tend to cluster around the river valleys: but that makes perfect historical sense, and within those limitations there are still opportunities to do the unexpected and to steal a march on your opponent through maneouvre. In my last game I made a supply line over the mountains and took the circuitous route into Ohio Forks as the British, just taking it in time and cutting off the French forces in the Southwest; careful placement of stockades opens up the strategic options by allowing fast movement even in the Wilderness.
I marginally prefer the full campaign over the AM scenario, but if either player is new to the game then definitely do the shorter one. Otherwise, early errors may prove fatal.

PbeM suitability: quite high - there's the odd interrupt card (Foul Weather etc) and plenty of interceptions and avoiding battle, but otherwise not bad if you let one player roll both sides in a battle. Turns can be very short at times.

I believe that this was the first operational (as opposed to strategic) card-driven wargame, which may explain its immense popularity among many traditional grognards.  While the game (at least the 1757 scenarios) does a good job recreating the French & Indian War, historicity isn't everything.  The chrome-to-substance ratio is the highest for any game I've played.  At seven different troop types, there are at least four too many.  British light troops, for example, seem to be included merely to prevent British forces from being ambushed in wilderness terrain later in the game.  Couldn't this have been accomplished with a card play?  That's the big problem with this game: it has all of the disadvantages of the card-driven genre, but fails to take advantage of many of its strengths.  For all of the fiddly chrome rules, some of them make no sense: e.g. stockades provide a defensive bonus for the defender, but forts do not.  The 1755 scenarios don't work right, as there are a number of event cards that each side needs, but the game has neither the mandatory-play cards of We the People nor the play-from-the-discard cards of Age of Napoleon, so most of these events will occur late if ever.  The superior 1757 scenarios assume that most of these cards have already been played.  Also, the strategic options are quite limited, as the French are basically reduced to raiding (which is just a die roll) while the British methodically advance.  Unfortunately, the most important avenue of advance—-through Louisbourg to Quebec—-is determined not by game play but card draws.

It has a very good feeling of the period and the subject, with clear rules which help you focus on the strategy and not on deciphering.. Playing the British you have to make small steps trying to attenuate the initial French advantage until you are strong enough to strike. Playing the French, try to grab as many points as possible early on and then defend the forts by using the increased mobility of Montcalm and use the Indians to the greatest extent.

Do not ever believe wargamers who claim that this is "as simple as Washington's War". It is not. Still, I really love how the atmosphere of the French/British conflict is depicted in Wilderness War. Although the learning curve may be surpisingly steep (the instruction booklet is deceptively short), this game is every bit worth the effort of learning the rules and a "must have" for anyone interested in the topic.

Two player CDG, supported by ACTS.  Gotta have it!

Recieved a copy of the reprint, Great rules, and game quality.  There is a lot of game here.  Rules are simple, and intuitive, but have quite a few exceptions.  After two plays strategy seems to be wide open.  Also seems like you play more cards as events than other CDG's.  Like it a lot.

Excellent CDG title. Asymetrical warfare with a clean rules system. Full  war can be a little long, but not a tedious drag. I love the game pieces-actual regiments that fought in the war, not generic strength points. I wish American Revolution games used the actual regiments, not points. One of my fave CDG's.

Wilderness War is attractively presented and the subject matter is interesting. The games offers scope for different strategies and is replete with tactical options for bot sides.

This should rank higher for me, as I like the subject matter  a lot and the designer knows what he is doing, but this really left me cold. I was looking forward to utilizing the various types of troops, and I liked how the raids, departments, and stockades worked.  In the end however, I was disappointed.  For me, the various parts were lost in a system that seemed somehow generic or disconnected.

I love CDGs, but this title seems to have a few problems:
- the game is fiddly; many small rules and rules exceptions (and exceptions from exceptions) completely unneccessary/not justified from the gaming point of view as well as from the historical perspective.. ('false' chrome)
- a bit too many generic/uninteresting/rarely played (or occuring) events.  Events don't play out as interesting sequences too.
- the game seems generally a bit outdated comparing to newer CDGs; you can feel it distinctly -> many rules, possibilities, cards which rarely matter...
- reshuffle occurs way too often - it's enough to play a proper event.  That way you can have reshuffle (with draw pile) even after 1 hand.  Absurd.  Cards you are waiting for may never show up in the game...  Whoahh...

BUT my biggest complaint is:
- the game seems to fall into similar tracks every time (2 war fronts: western (Ohio Forks region) and central one (from Ticonderoga to Montreal) and sluggish movement of forces in each of these areas) ; it seems there is too little variety in the gameplay and surprising manoeuvres

Still, despite above objections the game plays nicely and _smoothly_. There are emotions during the game.  That's the most important for me.
  It's an OK game and despite all of its shortcomings I would've probably decided to keep it if not that final complaint...

Sold.

Outstanding replayability, excellent historical flavor, short playing time for the tournament scenario, and remarkably good rules.  Wilderness War is perhaps more dependent on luck than the other card-driven games, particularly in the timing of reinforcements, but this was a conflict that was heavily contingent on factors outside of the North American theater.

WW also has one of the best CRTs around.

RATING: 8
So as predicted my rating for this game is going UP.  My last play was just SO much fun.  The game system is so very tight, it simply works.  USE the advanced rules or you're missing the meat of this contest.  The French MUST use infiltration and the Brits have to build defenses to intercept.  Catching a sneaking raiding party with your drilled troops is awesome.  The game feels very well balanced to me, and there's plenty of room for maneuver and strategy.  Fate will play a hand with the cards you're dealt, and help to determine where you can focus your energy.  This is a terrific game imo.

It "fixed" some of the Hannibal-style CDG but ended up trading them for other "issues" which are probably more glaring.  The asymmetric gameplay is pretty tight but the events and optional play tends to make it feel pretty scripted.  The CRT would appear to be cleaner than combat cards but its less flowing and the results are too scripted.  The building/fort aspects give a new interesting way to score VPs but the defensive play can boring in practice.  I do like it but just not as much as some other CDGs.

RATING: 8
2010 edition - one solo play to get the rules right, one ftf play only. 

Card driven wargame with significant unit differentiation and focus on limited forces in play (i.e. units are precious, especially for the French, who have very limited reinforcements), fortifications/sieges and Indian raids. This gives it a unique feel amongst CDGs. 

It's a little more complex than its sisters such as We the People/Washington's War/Hannibal, but it's worth it, It's still simpler (and quicker to play) than the more complex CDGs such as Paths of Glory.

I really like the different strata in the game, i.e. the completely different feel of the head-to-head struggle on the Albany-Montreal axis, the high-stakes Halifax-Louisburg-Quebec amphibious assault line, the Indian skirmishing and the opportunities for wilderness campaigning around Ohio Forks/Niagra. Underpinning this is the decision making around when/where to build/destroy fortifications, so necesary to support wilderess campaigning but such a target for opportunistic enemy raiders.

All this means that (unlike a number of CDGs) the decision making isn't around simply where you apply your generic forces, you need to decide which type(s) of forces you want to apply, and where.

Excellent, multi-layered game.

To date the absolute best of the card driven games.

The game has a fine balance of historical flavor and playability that generates a narrative during game play that feels quite real.  Moreover, this game also has the cleanest set of rules of any wargame I have ever played, which is saying a lot considering this is a card driven wargame.  Finally, the graphic treatment, extras such as detailed designers notes and an extended sequence of play coupled with short playtime make this game a real gem.  Other designers and developers could learn a lot about good game design and development by studying the many things that were done "right" in this game.

RATING: 9
The rules are admirably brief and errata-free. There are many types of units and their different movement/battle capabilities can be tricky to internalize. I like how you can demolish your own fortifications if you feel they're in danger of being captured for VPs. 

The terrain effects and supply rules are perfectly suited to the nature of the war. The British need good fortune to draw the cards that get their regulars on the board, then must start the long haul through the wilderness to the valuable French targets. France starts with an edge that they hope to maintain with a regular regimen of raids and stout defense of the Louisbourg fortress. 

This is the perfect "playable in an evening" wargame that still has plenty of meat on the bone.

Play with advanced rules immediately and don't wait until you learn the basic system.

Very playable simulation of an assymetrical conflict and the constraints on supply and command and control during the time period. Would be a 10 if it was less dependent on luck of the draw. (If the English get many reinforcements early, they win, and if they get them late, they lose, more or less. But if the reinforcements are reasonably paced out, the game is extraordinary.)

One of GMT's most popular games over the years.  I have not been into CDGs in the past, but it certainly adds another dimension (and more flavor) to the game.

One of my favourite CDG, and one of the few game that manages to simulate an assymetrical war between vastly different opponents. The mighty brits have to wage a patient war, cultivating their vast superiority in men, while advancing across the Wilderness to attack the french heartland. Meanwhile, the French benefit from a superior leadership and defensive interior lines (mainly using canoes, which is disoncerting at first...), all the while launching raids with their indian allies. A most excellent game.

*All Comments Based on Solo Play*

Nice balance of detail and ease of play. The different terrain and unit types keep a simple system from being too simple. A few neat event cards thrown in but it is mostly about the military maneuvering and recruitment. I like the abstracted militia system, and the provincial assembly. I'm tempted to desire more of those extra systems but I think there is a nice balanced elegance in what the game includes and doesn't. The mechanics all interact meaningfully instead of feeling like clunky additions. The game gets a boost in rating for this ability to pose it's not overly complex historical simulation as a deep game.

I think winter attrition could be more granular?

Rating based on one playing.  A one-deck Card Driven game like For The People but much lighter.  Some of the cards seemed overly powerful if they came up too early.  In the game I played, I got the British reinforcements the first turn and also had the luck of killing off the best French leader early in the game.  I had a lot of fun as the British romping through the French cities in Canada, but I think my opponent didn't enjoy the game too much.  I'd be willing to play this again though.

Good card-driven wargame, simulating the war between the British and the French & Indians in North America (1754–1763). Fast for a wargame - playable in 5 hours. The impact of a bad die roll or unlucky card draws can be (too) high, but nevertheless an interesting and engaging gaming experience. ***** Plays for the scenario "Annus Mirabilis (1757-59)", which is the tournament scenario covering 3 years (with each year having two seasons): three times as the French and once as the British. Plays for the scenario "Early War Campaign (1755-59)": once as the British.

Fantastic map and counters, and great simulation of a little-known war. Limited strategic options, but lots of colour and tension.

This was the first Card Driven wargame that I had played and I enjoyed it so much that it has led me to explore the genre further.  I am not very knowledgeable about the French and Indian War, but the level of detail suggests a good deal of historical accuracy in the game's presentation.  I found the rules to be substantial (perhaps becuase I'm used to euro games) but not overwhelming.  All in all, a worthwhile game that has improved with further play.

Ok I know that some cards are killers, like the Bay of Quiberon played too early, and I would definitively not recommend the 1755 scenario.

But apart from that I love this game, it has a lot of chrome. The victory conditions are well thought, the possibility to gain victory points with guerilla warfare as well as standard warfare, the discrepancy in force are all well thought.

Excellent and easy to play game. It never took us more than 2 evenings to complete (10 hours max)

This wargame does almost everything right. The complexity level suits the war and scale it is depicting, there are many options available to each player, its extremely well balanced, it plays in a reasonable amount of time, the presentation is attractive and the rules are completely free of ambiguities (I cannot stress how nice it is to be able to play a war game without having wade through consimworld to find clarrifications and errata).

The tournement scenario takes 2-3 hours and is extremely satisfying. Both sides feel like theyre making important decisions (and theres a multitude of options) on every turn and its intense the whole way due to never being quite sure which cards the other player has.

Im not really sure that militia or light infantry do much other than add a bit more chrome to the game. At this scale i wouldnt have minded if they were ignored. But thats a minor point.

Absolutely one of the best GMT wargames. I wish there were more like it.

Captures a sideshow in game designs. Good historical feeling, but too less strategic possibilities. You have as British only 3 channels of advance and as French you have to wait, til you will be beaten. Especially three cards in the game are very valuable and if you will not get them and your opponent will get his very quickly, you will shurely loose. That's bad luck and not bad gaming, which is disappointing. So all you get are wonderfull components with a mediocre game.

12/18/05 Played once. Nice cards and counters. Adequate rules and player aids. Sub-par map (I really dislike mapsheets - they never lay flat). Same complaint I have with many GMT games; too much chrome. I don't see why it needs seven troop types, step losses, early and late seasons in the same year, and several kinds of terrain. All that contributes to making the game take three times longer than We the People. Longer/more detail seldom equals "better" to me.

I have not played every game in this series, but after 10 or so playings I am still engrossed in playing this wonderful game.  More complex than We the People, but the rules seem intutive.  This title should be considered one of the better titles in the card driven war games genre.

Also any comments about balance are unfounded in my opinion.  The Brits may have the more obvious plays, and as such may have an advantage with inexperienced players.

I think this one of the best WtP style games. Very tense, as you must watch for potential holes in your lines that raiders can exploit. Seems like play can eventually get a little stale, since there aren't a lot of avenues to explore. One plus that I especially appreciate -- this game has perhaps the best written rules of any board wargame I've ever played (and I've played a lot...!).

Edit: After playing most of the other card driven wargames, this is in my opinion by far the best. Wonderful design! Edit to Edit: Maybe For the People is best. WW is not nearly as complicated. I love them both.

Edit: just received the latest version (summer '15), and what a beauty. Great job by GMT. It's interesting to contrast the original release with this one -- the original release was perfectly fine, but this version is high class from top to bottom, from the actual game box to the mapboard. The game has always been great, but now all the trappings around the game are just as great.

Played a friend's copy, and got SLAUGHTERED as the English.  New York was renamed Jeune Paris.  I like the variation in abilities of the units.  Have not figured out the value of raids yet.  Movement difficult, and timing conflict on three fronts.  Couldn't wait for the reprint, so I got my own copy. 

November '17: British win tournament scenario in 1759 early as Bradstreet takes Niagara, and Ohio Valley already held.  Early loss of Louisburg made it tough on the French and they could not recover.

This is a very good game, if somewhat unbalanced in favor of the British. It is the first card-driven game I've purchased and it is highly enjoyable with quality components--the rule book is the best-written of the four GMT games I own.

Very very good wargame. All the main points of the specific struggle are here:
- woods and how they impact movement; same for rivers
- natives and their affiliations; raids
- paramount importance of stockades (or forts)
- leaders and raids/battle
Rules are easy, but the system is still less elegant (and somewhat "fiddly") than the next Runhke design: COINs!

DAMN this game is good!  I just got trashed by my nemesis Jim, but what a great system!  Further plays will tell if it moves up or down, if at all, but wow!

Being interested in the war represented probably has some influence on its high rating... that aside it's also a great game. The Annus Mirabilis scenario clocks in at around 3 hours, and is a blast to play. It's not complex for a wargame, it's relatively quick, and there are at least a few viable strategies for each side to achieve victory. Tense throughout, and the choices of strategy are brutal. Expect it to hit the table every few months.

Classic CDG. I prefer Washington's War for this time period but really that's just down to preference and more of a connection with the subject matter. Taking forts in this game is really hard, so there's a cool level of historicity.

RATING: 7
A great maneuver game which is fast and very tense from beginning to end. Card here have not dramatic effects such as in PoG so you can concentrate on playing your game without thinking about deck management, disrupt effect of some cards etc. It's a great game, the only problem I have with it is that after some repeated playings its hard to see new tactics at work... still, a must play.

RATING: 6
I actually enjoyed this. This felt like the first proper campaign-style war game I've ever played and understood pretty thoroughly. The combat is still a little slow-paced for my tastes, and the amount of spaces on the board is pretty daunting. That all being said, I think this is an excellent next step game for those who played and enjoyed Twilight Struggle, but want something with more emphasis on an actual war. For me personally, I'll probably stick with A Few Acres of Snow. It's far more abstracted (Also maybe more imbalanced?), but I think it suits my tastes better.

I don't think that the Campaign Game got much testing, and it turns on the draw of the cards.  The game is much too 'busy' for my taste, and the strategic options are too limited.  It also didn't help that my map fell to pieces after a few playings.  The rules are, however, a model of how to write a tight, easy-to-understand set of rules for a complex wargame.

Volko Ruhnke has done a spectacular job of recreating the drama and the various types of conflicts of the French and Indian War. You have two sides that tend to wage completely different campaigns, the challenges of wilderness and mountain areas, the construction (and demolition) of forts and stockades, raiding Indians and Rangers, and a nearly perfect VP system that's tied to global politics and perceptions. Add in four different scenarios to be played and a bunch of cool French names, and you have wonderful gaming experience.

A conflict that I know virtually nothing about, though it makes for a very engaging wargame. The designer has emphasised the operational and strategic differences of the participants brilliantly.

This is one fantastic game. There is a lot going on here and really brings alive an interesting era in US/Canada history. I find this to be one of the easier CDGs to teach, but that doesn't take away from the depth and strategy of it. 

If GMT actually had quality components to this game, it would be amazing. It's easily my favorite 2player CDG.

Point to point CDG of the French and Indian War 1755-62. The French start with the advantages in leadership, Indians and navigation, but sooner or later the British and Americans will overwhelm them. Players must use water routes or build a line of fortifications for speedy movement and supply through the wilderness, but as these cost VPs if lost they must be built with care. Indians can be used to raid, a useful source of VPs for the French, but the Americans have enough militia to fortify their frontier if need be. I found the British too strong in the campaign scenario, so I have VPs debited when each side plays a reinforcement card. This also represents the huge expenditure the British made in the war, and the political costs involved. In the end the British bought victory over the French, but at the cost of alienating the American colonies with taxes to help pay for the war.

I have only managed to play one and three half games of this since buying it less than a year ago. But may I just say that they were some of the best one and three half games I have ever played of any wargame so far.

I am familiar with the history of what is being simulated and I think that the design, the use of cultivated/wilderness/mountain areas and the flavour of the cards make this one of the best wargames & particularly CDGs that I have ever played.

At least a decade behind in my praise for this game, but for a game to be so playable after all these years and feel so fresh-with so many other designs and copies of it's ideas around is surely testament to it's design.

I'm a big fan of event cards and WW doesn't disappoint here: from Quiberon Bay and Diplomatic Revolution events to tactical problems of small pox, the game accurately conveys the tough wilderness campaign. It's a wonderful, tense atmospheric game that may frustrate non-Grognard types early on (I still have to refer to the advanced rules!) but it is worth preserving with. It's my favourite wargame by a large margin.  

Face value the game seems to be restricted to three fronts and repetitive gameplay, however all of my games have been completely different because of the random nature of drawing the cards (something I actually like). 

The one-deck event cards makes the game, although some will think it overly chaotic. Personally, not a problem, but this is a tactical game - particularly the AM scenario. If you like to play your CDGs in a strategic, chess-like fashion, WW could frustrate.

Excellent campagne game! Well researched, and full of 18th Century flavor and facts. The historic confrontation of Wolfe vs. Montcalm plays different each time with the card driven mechanics. The rules are well edited, very descript and seem to cover everything. (made learning the game easier) There are many strategies each player can follow. The French must hit HARD in the early game to overcome the growing number of British Drilled Troops that arrive later. Additionally, the French must use the indians to help absorb losses. The British must use Johnson to get auxilery troops to help guide their troops through the wilderness. Whenever I play this I can't help but admire it. Nice job, GMT!

One of my favorite wargames, and for me one of the best card driven wargames out in the market.  I find the game to be well balanced (I've won the long campaign as the French!), and exciting every time I play it.  Rules are straightforward, the situation is tense (both players share the same deck of cards), and it is one of the games where you look at the opening situation and say to yourself "What the heck do I do now?".

If you get a copy of this game, the deluxe board from GMT is recommended.  Comes with leader holding boxes that aren't, but should, be on the paper map.

Rating after one play. I'm not real sure what to think about this game right now. I know I liked it, but from my learning of the rules I thought I would like it more, and have a more instant love of it. I found that for a lot of actions you roll just one die, with modifiers and what-not, and I thought that this was a nice way to speed things up and I hoped it would, with good planning, mitigate the luck by giving you the chance to plan the DRM's to your advantage. This is still true of course, but my opponent and I were both rolling pretty low, frustratingly, and not a lot was actually getting accomplished. We both spent turn after turn after turn after turn trying to siege the same forts to no avail. I rolled five or six 1's, 2's, and 3's and did jack-shit all in a row. The game felt futile. I am really hoping that the next play will be better, that now that I am familiar with the rules in a practical sense I can start the game out with more of a plan and hopefully do better.

A fine game, love the the CDG system and theme, but as a card carrying Euro-snoot I had trouble getting past the paper map. All of the components are really well done (especially the cards), but the board should really have been mounted, or printed on thick card at the very least. Perhaps the inevitable reprint will include the deluxe map?

Update: Well, I quit my whinin' (to continue with the DW Tripisms) and got some plexiglass, and also played using the deluxe map. I'm increasingly impressed with the elegance of this game: it's very mature, polished, and unambiguous for a wargame. Highly recommended.

I just could not get into this game.  I played it once and gave up about half way through it.  I can not place my finger on the exact problem but I just could not get into the theme, had trouble reading the map and developing a strategy.  This is a game that may need to be played against a veteran so you can see some strategies play out.

This is the first game where I looked at the board after setup and said "now what do I do" but never came up with anything substantial.

After one play I'll rate it a 7.5. This will probably go up after more plays if the depth I barely plumbed in the first game is a deep as I suspect. A lot to do in this game. It takes a bit to get your head around the rules, but it is the 'What do I do now?' feel that makes this so deep. Lots to do and never enough time. 1st game ran just under 5 hours with set up and many trips to the rule book. Flowed much better as the game went on and we learned how and what to do.

I've played it once now face-to-face and found it much more difficult than anticipated -- not in terms of rules complexity, but terrain constraints. That's not necessarily bad; it just worked out differently than what I had envisioned from just reading the rules. I'd like to play again at the soonest opportunity.

On the downside, it doesn't seem too amenable to solitaire play. My rating might go up with more chances to play against an opponent.

RATING: 7
Superb middle complexity CDG that meshes the best of Mark Herman's system but layers it with several wargamey bits (CRTs, lots of tables). This game is a neat recreation of the 7 Years War in America: one player takes the French and the other, the British. It's an asymetrical game in the sense that both sides have different ways to win: the French has an early edge and will use more Indians and Auxiliaries to make raids for VPs. The British has better quality troops and have more cards that allow them to amass power to take key French controlled cities.

The tournament scenario plays fairly quickly and can actually be played at a breakneck speed once you get familiar with the tables and charts. Excellent game and it cries for a reprint!

After more plays, gameplay is solid but does not quite capture the tension of other games such as Hannibal. The Tournament Scenario seems well-balanced, although a lot hinges on the timing of British reinforcements (and who gets the Surrender card). Don't really see how the French could win the long game.
-----------------
The British are gearing up for a large-scale invasion and the French have to use their Indian allies and the North American wilderness to slow and harass British regulars/ At first, it appears the British are unstoppable and the riverlines limit strategy. But there's a lot more depth to the game than is immediately apparent, and the differentiation of the troop types and usage to simulate wilderness conditions is very well done.

RATING: 8
Card-driven wargame set in the French and Indian War of 1755-1760. The game is driven by the play of cards with dual purposes. Firstly they have an operations value that can be used to move forces, engage in combat, build fortifications etc. Secondly, each card has an event that can be triggered to further a particular side's cause. The two sides play quite differently, whereby the British are better suited to direct combat between forces and sieges, whereas the French with their greater number of Indian units are more adept at raids and movement across country. Combat is simple and effective with dice-rolling against a table that takes into account units' strength and leaders' tactical proficiency. 'Wilderness War' is a very solid game where participants have to balance the desire to attain their own victory conditions with a necessary focus on preventing the opponents from achieving theirs. The tried and tested mechanism of dual-purpose cards work well and leads to some interesting decision making, which in turn means that this is an absorbing and tense strategy wargame.

It looks really good, and after reading the rules I did like it quite a lot. After playing, I like it even more. In fact enough to read few books about the topic and that is not common occurrence with games. WW offers interesting strategic challenges, similar to Hannibal but less political and more military and logistics. That said, the key is great disparity of forces, and almost completely opposing operating principles of forces.

Once familiar with the few unique bits, game flows nicely. Familiarity with cards comes in time, and it is a sort of essential - like in a Hannibal. On the same token, the game appears to have quite bit of replay value, even though the probable avenues of advance are somewhat  (but not always) predictable (same was said on Hannibal as negative comment, yet it has not diminished the value for long term gaming).
---
- 0.2 points from the non eloquent solution to use half victory points for raids. Not because of the math, but because of raid optimization (not a whole lot, but -0.2 point worth) it leads to.
---
For a wargame, Wilderness War seems to offer surprising amount of non-fighting, which in turn is interesting aspect.

RATING: 9
Does the best of the CDGs as far as causing anst over whether to play the event or play the card for OPs.  Some CDGs you have good events you always play and bad events you never play.  

Game drips with theme, giving a good sense of operating a European style war in the North American frontier.  Superior job of capturing Indians and their effect on the war. 

Does not have the political control angle of Hannibal or We the People.  Instead, winning battles, successful Raids, and investing forts gives you VPs on the VP track.  Both sides have auto-victory conditions.  For the British it means taking 2 of 4 objective spaces, and for the French ending a turn with 10+ VPs.

The most tactical CDG I've had the good fortune to play.  This definitely leans more toward the "move your troops around" kind of CDG, much like [gameid=234] or [gameid=26457], and less like the political CDGs I most love, like the COIN series or [gameid=17392].  That said, I enjoy it, and there's a lot to like here.  The asymmetry here is historic and very interesting, and you really feel the tension of wanting to do everything, but having the resources to only do the barest sliver.  From what I know of the conflict, it seems a great way to simulate the strategic-level thinking of the war.

The luck has too much weight, much more than in other Card Driven games.
In 1755 scenarios the random factor in cards is still more critical. I have seen games (without advanced rules)where the luck can be decisive, without no possible strategy to avoid the defeat. 

I think that campaign scenarios have been little tested.

Very tentative rating after two sessions spent with the Annus Mirabilis scenario.

This is the deepest 2-player CDG wargame I've played, and perhaps the cleverest of them all. So many truly great elements centering on fortification, raids, supply. Moves a lot slower than Hannibal, requires much greater patience, so will be a hard one to master for impetuous natures like myself. - NOT an option for the table on evenings where my brain is not in full swing.

The quirky odds in the CRT do their best to make any planning and strategy meaningless. With a d6, "extreme results" are too common. Other than the dice, there are many features to love in Wilderness War. Terrain and different unit types have to be carefully considered. Chain of command and the mobility of the irregulars offer tactical options. However, a streak of low rolls with the dice can ruin hours of careful planning and the entire game especially for the British player, making him want to pull his hair out. Still, all the addiction and tension of a very good card driven wargame is there.

RATING: 6
1/22/09 -- I really want to like Wilderness War, but rules ambiguities have plagued all 5 or so games of it I've played, and I'm just tired of it.  

6/18/07 - Hmmmmmmmm.  The jury is still out on Wilderness War.  I appreciate the fact the game length was kept within reason on this one (when playing the tournament scenario, at least), and something about this game is unusually immersive, thematically-speaking.  Still...I can never quite seem to remember ALL the rules in-game despite the fact that I really feel I should, and the fact that Indians can raid empty spaces, an integral component of the French strategy, seems to be not fully developed from a rules perspective.  So, while not as clean as Hannibal, it's the more engaging game IMO (if comparisons aren't out of the question), but neither would beat a revised We The People, which I anxiously await.

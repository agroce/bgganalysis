Another social deduction game that at first glance simply could not be fun - but beyond all expectations it really IS fun!.  The game can be over in the first pick - as happened to us on our very first game, but amazingly even that generated huge roars of laughter that set the scene for following plays, which were inevitable.

The theme might not be too strong here, but it at least makes sense. This is a cute deduction game which is simple to teach and quick to play. Get hidden roles, shuffle out cards, check your cards, shuffle so you don't know which order yours are in, and then try convincing the active player where he/she should investigate.

Quick social deduction in which investigators attempt to locate all 4 elder signs mixed in the row of cards in front of each player while the cultists want to fin the sole Chutulhu card. Each player is able to see the 5 cards in front of them but must reshuffle the cards so exact placement is not known. The game plays very quick and which could be perfect to start a game night. The game doesn't do much to really separate itself from other social deduction games but could be worth seeking for fans of the Chutulhu theme.

Totally solid little bluffing game. It's an overcrowded genre, though, and this one doesn't do [i]quite[/i] enough to make me want to buy it. In general, the bluffing doesn't feel very dynamic - cultists and investigators each have some set bluffs they can/should use and it's pretty apparent what makes sense to say when. Doesn't lend itself to the same range of exciting and funny choices of even something like Cockroach Poker, IMO.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Probably the definitive 4 player hidden role game, if not quite a titan of the genre. Still a fun and different twist on the genre that really should have still been named Timebomb. Because "accidentally summoning Cthulu" is a joke.

RATING: 7
Light, quick, more fun than I expected. One of those 'Let's just play one more round' games.

It has a redeeming quality, that of being short, simple and somewhat tongue-in-cheek, but you have to bring your fun with you and there is a substantial amount of luck involved which throws any sensible strategies out the window. Not a bad game, but not one that traces any new ground. Can become a bit boring side after a few plays. Pass.

Pareil, celui là, on l'a déjà à la triche. Ramené de Essen 2015. C'est aussi un jeu minimaliste japonais où une équipe de terroristes essaye de faire sauter une bombe. Les autres doivent les débusquer. Mais voilà, contexte international oblige, c'est un thème qui ne passe plus trop auprès du grand public. La version IELLO habille donc le thème avec Sherlock Holmes Vs Moriarty à Londres. On est dans du p'tit jeu d'ambiance à la Loup garou.
Pour 4 à 8 poseurs de bomb... euh ...sbires de Moriarty dans des parties de 30 minutes

A fun little bluffing and deduction game. It reminds me a little of the Resistance. The shuffling and handing out cards each round can get a little bit annoying.

A very good party game. A solid 7 rating.

RATING: 1
A broken game.  You can lie about your role (terrorist/swat) and also lie when anyone asks you a question. There can be an equal amount of both roles in the game. I fail to see any deduction elements in this game.  It is just a big ole crap shoot of picking cards.  To pass this off as a game is a stretch.  I hope we got a rule wrong.

RATING: 8
A truly superior hidden identity game.  Unlike the "One Night..." games, it doesn't end with revealing identities.  That's only a means to an end, so there's an entirely other level of complexity to the game.  And NO ELIMINATION.  Players can still win even if unmasked.  Played very well with five.  Can't wait to try more.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Time Bomb: One or two players are terrorists in this Japanese micro-style game. The others are good people. No one knows who is who. The terrorists are attempting to detonate the bomb to win. Each round each player has five cards and one of the twenty cards is a bomb. A player chooses a card to reveal and if it is the bomb the terrorists win. So there is much bluffing and table talk. 

There is less real deduction involved than Resistnace, but the simple rules and short playing time means the game is really successful. 

RANT: There is a US reprint called Don't Mess with Cthulhu. Now, I understand the desire to re-theme the game from the Japanese original, since a game about terrorists and bombs could upset people who are sensitive to game theming. However WHY OH WHY does it have to have a Cthulu theme? WHat is it about Cthulu that so obsesses game publishers? Cthulu is a little-known story written a long time ago which, for some strange reason, has become the obsession of game publishers and the go-to theme for games. That and Steam Punk, an equally unknown concept to the wider public. Time Bomb is a great family and mass market game. Why then theme it around a geeky theme that appeals to a sub-set of gamey type people? There are endless themes from everyday life that could be employed to give this game broad appeal, so why theme it around one which has a narrow appeal and is completely meaningless and off putting to the broader market? 

So, a great little game which could, with a little family-friendly theming, have been a real mass-market hit. As it is it will fail to reach beyond the BGG market. Cthulu? Give me a break.

This is now my go-to social deduction game, having replaced Good Cop/Bad Cop, The Resistance, and Mafia/Werewolf.  There is no silly script to say with your eyes closed, no player elimination, and even if you are outed as a cultist, you still have agency in the game.  The strategy for playing this as both an investigator and a cultist are intuitive as well.

Social deduction á la Werewolf and The Resistance *except* there is no "shut your eyes" overhead and neither side is constrained to telling the truth.  The downside is a tighter player count (4-8).  Themewise, I imported the French Sherlock Holmes themed version instead of the UK Cthulhu themed release because I think this makes the game more accessible to non-gamers.  It does not have the special power cards, but I do not consider the game to need them.  It does come with some cool cardboard wire cutters (use a blob of superglue to stop the pivot falling apart).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This game is pretty fun. We had a lot of laughs, some hard decisions, and plenty of clever plays. I would always choose the Resistance over this with a group of gamers, but I will always choose this over Resistance with family and casual gamers.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

An inspired piece of end-of-evening silliness. Only problem is that there's almost no incentive to tell the truth about your cards, no-one wants to reveal whether they have successes or the bomb.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This is yet another Coup-style social deduction game, but this time with a Cthulhu theme.  The rounds are really quick. Players have two cards and make arguments to each other about which cards to look at (yours or someone else's).  There are some special cards that cause chaos.  This really isn't my favorite genre of game, but this was a fairly inoffensive entry in the genre. (1 play)

It is very hard to carve out any space in the traitor game niche. IMO Resistance has the market cornered and has ruined all others, kind of like how the Bourne movies ruined all other action movies, and how the Lord of the Rings movies ruined all other fantasy movies.

TimeBomb has a sort of questionable theme, and I could see how some people might not want to play a game about potentially being blown up maliciously. Though it makes a lot more sense than the atrocious retheme.

It is quick enough that it feels different, and the traitor element is fairly easy to play, which makes for a more relaxing and low key type of game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Dead simple but very fun social deduction game. The rules make it sound like there's not much to go on and that the game could just randomly end by making a wrong choice. And that is true. Those things happen. But the game is quick and short enough that this doesn't matter that much and there are also those moments when you manage to figure it all out. And it's those moments which make social deduction games shine.

I'm not a fan of the deception games but this one is decent. It has the whole Resistance vibe but is a little simpler to follow the logic and I felt like I had more control of the outcome than I usually do in Resistance. It's hard to win with only one cultist though (5 player) and I wonder if it wouldn't be better to always have two.

I still personally prefer The Resistance as far as bluffing / deduction games are concerned, but Don't Mess With Cthulhu is really close, and in fact it seems to be preferred by a lot of the people I play with.

This was the biggest surprise discovery for me because I thought it looked stupid when people ran a PBF a while back. Then Pete Vasi convinced me to give it a try at GenCon, and I fell in love. Somehow, two decks with only 5 different cards in them manage to have crazy levels of complexity and variety in strategies to play. I prefer to be Fremen in this one, but it's great trying to figure out what's going on too. Seriously an amazing game. I feel bad for taking so long to finally play it.

A terrific social deduction game.  It's a bit more random than "Resistance" style games, but it's quicker and lighter as well.

It works for my main group better as there's less deduction, though the engineers are definitely trying to bog down the gameplay by over analyzing.  Still, there's more room to move in this design and it stays fairly snappy.

Basically, I love this game, and expect that it is less group-dependent than many other social deduction games.  I do have the KS edition with the ability to play with more than 6, though I haven't done that much.  I also haven't tried the 2 variants, the Necronomicon and Powers I think they're called.

Feels like reverse Liar's Dice with a traitor element. I enjoyed the game, but don't think it's that special compared to other social deduction games.

I prefer Bang! The Dice Game and Good Cop, Bad Cop when it comes to this style of social deduction game.

Another Kickstarter game I'm mad I didn't back before. In my defense, hidden role/deduction and Cthulhu are subjects I'm not too interested in anymore. But this game is terrific! It contains everything fun about Werewolf/Resistance/Coup/Deception in Hong Kong within the space of thirty minutes. The best part of the game is the fact that the roles are secondary to the object of the game; even good guys have an incentive to lie about their intentions! It plays fast and it has become my new favorite way to break up mind-melting Euros like Terraforming Mars. Love this game and can't wait to get the expansion!

RATING: 7
Another "work out who's lying" game from Indie. One team win if the Cthulhu card is revealed. The investigator team win if 4 investigator cards are revealed beforehand. So if you're on the investigator team and you have investigator cards and not the Cthulhu card, you want the other players to reveal cards from your hand so that your investigator cards will hopefully be chosen (it's a random pick from your hand). But the baddie team will want to pick someone else hoping to find the Cthulhu card, if they believe your claim. If you do have the Cthulhu card and you're the investigator, you might say you've got no investigator cards so players won't hopefully pick from your hand. And reverse it all around depending on what team you're on. The first round is pretty random (and it could be all over after the first card pick as we found in our very first game!), but if you get past that, it improves with each round, trying to pick who might be on which team based on who they pick cards from, helping determine who you might be able to trust. And if it all crashes down around you too quickly, it's a game you can repeat play pretty quickly and have some fun with. Good filler.

Solid "new" social deduction game, as long as everyone is ok with the game ending in literally 1 minute then it'll work out.  Haven't played this one enough, but there seems to be some interesting ways to lie once you get into round 3.

I just don't get social deduction. As I said at the end, I just don't really feel like I've played a game. Still, it was quick and harmless, and played in good spirit with good company.

Pure bluffing. Reminds me a bit of Cockroach Poker in execution. Seems hard to win as the Investigators, but probably easier with a group of players all familiar with passing hidden information.

Awesome deduction and bluffing game.  Especially when you can reveal Cthulhu when everyone knows you're a Cultist.

Fantastic card game for 5-6 players. The game itself is very minimal, components boring, but the player interaction is fantastic. It's not just bluffing, it is psychology.

There seems to be a lot more luck in this game compared to other hidden role games, but it is still a decent amount of fun, it is very engaging, and has a decent amount of tension.

Got this at Essen 2015, and after a couple of early plays before we 'got' it, my group now absolutely loves this game. 

The game is so simple, yet the strategy actually runs a lot deeper than you would think at first glance. Because it's such a short and simple game we've had success even with people who are not normally fans of social deduction, while there's still a lot of strategy for more savvy players.

This is thus far my sleeper pick of the year, and probably my favourite game of the year. Slam dunk.

Solid mechanics. Another variant on the 'find the traitor'. But as I already own a couple games like that, I'm unlikely to purchase this one.

I'd happily play it again, though.

I don't like social deduction games much anyway, and here you cannot even gain much information, so it is the pure essence of social deduction. No, thanks.

Not much to this game and the artwork leaves something to be desired, but game play is well thought-out and fun.  The game does seem to be a little bit weighted toward cultists though.

This is my favorite deduction game, by far.  We have already nearly played my copy to death.  Luckily, two people I play with just picked up copies.  I don't see this one falling off at this point.  Easily the least fragile of all social deduction games, and I love that it often forces both good and bad guys to lie.

Great fast deduction game. There is a wonderful element where if you find out who the cultists are they still have opportunities to bluff and betray. excellent small bluffing game.

RATING: 6
Bluffing/hidden role game which is interesting since the best strategy is often to lie about your cards both as a bad guy (Terrorist) and a good guy (SWAT), unlike many other similar games. Unfortunately it suffers from the fact that some games can end much too soon.

Timebomb is hilarious. It's more social than deduction and you know what, that's just fine. This retheme is questionable but at least it's well produced. All hidden role games should use more tiles.

A good 2-3hr game. Nice to break out from time to time since it's really simplified and the wife and teens can play it. It's engrossing for what it is (condensed), just repetitive.

Best game of 2014!!!  This is the game that [thing=68264][/thing] [i]should[/i] have been.  THIS is your entry-level WWII/Eastern Front game.  Highly innovative block game with a reasonable number of blocks, a short rules overhead that captures the theme and history of the conflict in a reasonable one-sitting playing time.  Lots of nice chrome: Stukas, Case Blue, Russian Winters, mud, encirclements -- it's all here.  Not enough good things that I can say about this one.

Update: it kind of loses its luster over time.  The first few turns are really exciting, but then it turns into a slow-paced slug fest of attrition for the last half.  An early winter combined with a bad roll on the first turn pretty much ends the game for the Germans.  This caused me to drop my rating a couple of points.

Still, it is a really fun game to play the first few times and it is a remarkable achievement in wargame design.

Primero de la serie. Original el sistema de bloques que permite disputar la partida de una sentada.
Buena perspectiva de los años 1941 y 1942 en el frente ruso.
Muy adecuado el acabar el juego en esa fecha, ya que el resto de la campaña fue una guerra de desgaste más estática.

RATING: 6
Ok. It's a block and dice game. Roll well and you see the flow of history for the Germans. Roll badly and the Russians will be in Poland in 1942.

With an average roll and the Russians knowing what to do to shore up the defences, the Germans would be just rolling along to the outskirts of those Victory Cities and still lose the game. The Russians will just need minimal attacks to straighten up the line when the bigger boys starts to come in. In fact, the Russians could possibly win without making attacks.

It's an ok Russian front themed block-dice game. The fog of war did minimally to hide any fog as the number of units makes it known the moment the panzers move and attack. Fog of war worked better on the Russian side due to replacements and reinforcements.

The game reminds me of Avalanche press games on the eastern front. Or Columbia Games' 1812 in a broad front battle.

Holdfast is a VERY light eastern front themed wargame. It's like M44 scenarios compared to other dedicated deeper wargames.

Russian Front from Avalon Hill still reign supreme.
  
Rated at 5, gave an extra point to a 6 for the theme.

RATING: 7
A broad brush, fast-playing, ultra-simple treatment of the first two years of the Russian Campaign.  A novelty to me is the use of resource points (RP) that are spent to replace lost steps, move and attack.  RPs drain away in bad weather and, for the Soviets, with the loss of key cities.  The Soviets get an RP boost for the arrival of General Snow, while the Germans receive one with the first clear weather of '42.  This all works rather well in representing the fluctuating capacities of both armies to take action. The abandonment of separate movement and combat phases is also interesting, opening the possibility to punch a hole and then move through it.  All is not free-flowing blitzkrieg, however, as loss of supply has fatal consequences.  

HoldFast's simplicity seems to have been achieved without too much offence to the history.  The one exception that strikes me is the key role you will want to give to armour in attacking and defending fortress cities.  While I have enjoyed my first play I do wonder how often I'll wish to replay this game, with its single scenario and apparently limited strategic possibilities.

There were clearly some corners cut with the art and production of HoldFast.  While the map is functional, it has the look of something the Wylies might have knocked up for an early playtest, complete with errors in the set-up hexes.  Armour is more difficult than it should have been to distinguish from infantry and those German crosses that stretch as far as the numbers are unfriendly to these eyes.  The RP track on the back of the box appears a choice driven more by cost than by utility.  I found the rules generally well done, though they could have used a bit more proof reading.

WWII East Front with 6 pages of rules and 2-3 hour play time.  The rules distill down the essence of what an East Front scenario should have - weather, supply, air power - and works simply and effectively.  The first half of the game is fun with fast paced advances before bad weather hits - but after that it can get bogged down into a big pushing match between Axis blocks and Russian blocks, like rugby scrums around the VP cities.

RATING: 10
Fantastic game. 

Easy - only a few pages of rules. 

Bluffing - get the Germans to attack your strong units and ignore your weak 1 strength units.
 
Nail biting decisions - so many things to do but not enough resources.

Immersion - can move then attack or attack then move. You feel like you're really planning your campaigns.

Fun - Everybody gets a chance to take the offensive!

RATING: 7.9
Simple and elegant, what No Retreat! should have been with hexes and counters. Surprisingly accurate flow of the campaign, a lot of trade-offs due to the RP mechanics and open Movement/combat phase. A bit long to play with too many turns, maybe a Sudden Death test should be added in 41. I estimate a typical game to go for 3-4 hours.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Exactly what I like in a war game: a) straight forward, easy to digest rule set; b) low counter (block) density; and c)  fast and furious action (well for a war game anyway!).

While it has several non-standard rules (combat dice are no tied to number of steps on block), it is still a very good game to introduce the war game genre to new gamers.

RATING: 8
Seems to be the best of the holdfast series. Germany must push very hard to win this game. Quite a bit longer (3-4 hours) than i expected for a simple block game, but there are two full years or so to play through, so like 20-25 turns iirc.  I think a Shorter Scenario should have been included, with the first two or four months out of the way.

I'll be the first to admit that I don't play many two player games and I don't generally play many war games... That's something I've been trying to change recently and I've added several to my collection in the last year. HoldFast: Russia was the first of these to make it to the table and that is in large part thanks to Blinky. Best described as a beer and pretzels war game this plays relatively fast and straight forward. I played as the Germans and ended up loosing pretty badly. One on one I could win most any fight, but I was unable to break through the massed Russian's at the end of the game. Seems like the Germans really need to haul ass early on. We played a few rules wrong, but I really look forward to getting this to the table again. I suspect that a second play of this game will see my rating rise.

Though I've only played a portion of one game, I already know this will be one of my favorites.  Very minimalistic mechanics but you still have a feel for the over-arching decisions facing the combatants in this very popular theater of WW2.
Judd's Vassel module is outstanding as well and automates many of the tedious houskeeping tasks very well.  I highly recommend this game to any new wargamer!

Love the easy set up, and that it's fast playing, provides plenty of tension, and a variety of decisions to make. Another plus is the choice (flexibility) to choose between moving and attacking OR attacking and moving. It feels like the historical east front campaign from the books I've read and documentaries I've watched. I have No Retreat the Russian Front, and it is a great game but for me it has a lot of moving parts and can bog down a little bit. Also it is a longer game.  

Holdfast:Russia 1941-42 is a great way to experience a fun, fast-playing game game about the Eastern front that feels like history and can be accomplished in an evening.

very good game, have a nice time playing it, tense with important decision to make. may be lack some chrome (all unite have the same value, no SS, no italians o ungarians, no air unit for soviet) but it is simple for that reason.

but it is a keep and play at least 1 time, you will not regreat.

The eastern front, playable in an evening with little fuss which is sort of a miracle. This game is all about the raw basics of the campaign; special rules are non-existent. It works well as a game and okay as history. Best of all, the Russians do not have an easy time here and your 1941 defensive stands will often have the appropriate air of desperation. Still, there is a sameness to the game that prevents me from fully embracing it.

Update: This game has grown on me.. big time!

Sure it's simple, but within its simplicity it delivers all the basics of a supply-based strategical wargame with the constant struggle of cutting the enemy off, bluffing, looking weak in one place while looking strong in another. Fucking beautiful..! (pardon me i'm european)

Yes, some of the rules create a little ludonarative dissonance like railmoving troops through swamp far behind enemy lines.. but i gladly pay that price for a streamlined gameplay.
A.f.a.i.k. the Korea title is a bit weaker..

_____________________________________________

Much like No Retreat. Actually they stole pretty blatantly from No Retreat, cut all the fiddly stuff out (along with the CDG mechanic) and kept/streamlined the good things.
But same with no retreat the gameplay can feel quite repetitve & simple. So much that it feels a bit like an abstract game.
And then there is the game lenght, for what it is, it just feels a bit too long.
Even after my second play i felt like going throught the motions. Due to limited tactical options the replay value is rather miniscule.

But if you're looking for a two-player entry-level wargame & are interested in the barbarossa campaign, it's the game to buy.

Bravo for HOLDFAST
Back to the old days when wargames were clean, simple, challenging and fun (and historical enough as long as you don't get games and books mixed up)
There is brilliance in that with basically 3 pages of rules (deleting illustrations and photographs) this ruleset will produce the possibilities that could have occured.  
There are a just a FEW variables that can cause these variabilities.  Weather and RPs (Resource Points).
Factors in the game are Airpower, Supply, Breakthroughs, Weather, Reinforcements and especially Replacements (Resource Points).
You could go the entire game never rolling MUD unlike SNOW which is guaranteed two months out of the year.
Snow HOWEVER, is not that devastating for the German (unlike in TRC........).  In fact a little luck on the bone and you will hardly notice a difference between Snow and a sunny spring day.

Thrilled to see the WG philos reverse direction from the runaway philos of 'If this can be done in 2 pages of rules then 10 pages will be better.......'

Great job WG and a 9.3 from me on BGG.

Played once FTF and enjoyed a very close game which came down to the wire, with the Soviets barely holding onto Moscow.  To me, Holdfast has less "guff" than other Eastern Front designs (EastFront, TRC, Defiant Russia) while offering similar drama and strategic decisions.  The resources point system seems generous at first blush, but when you get into the thick of the game and start having to cope with lousy weather, that calculus changes quickly.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Great implementation of a block system. The limited moves/supply per turn and non-rigid turn sequence make one plan more than one would expect. You can move and fight in any sequence depending on what you pay for. Move some units and fight to make a hole then pay to move more units through the hole and fight again etc.
The supply is also varied by weather which makes mud and snow appropriately tough for the attackers.

This is a fantastic game that takes no time to learn and just a few hours to play yet encapsulates all that is the Ostfront. This is a perfect intro wargame and has enough detail and challenge for even an old grognard who doesn't have time to play Case Blue. Recommended!

so after 3 face to face + 2 vassal games (and 3 solitaire) I enjoy a lot this game. Have still to better understand how can I better play both the russians and the germsns!

updated july 18th 2014
after 1 face to face and one through Vassal I can say the game is greeeeaaaat!
---------------
just got my copy. Had only the chance to play solitaire four times right now.
what I don't like
- soft box (I prefer a stronger one à la GMT)
- the starting points printed on the map are, in my copy and to my eyes, very difficult to read.

what I like:
- the system is very easy, very accessible and straightforward. Furthermore, the either move or move&attack or attack&move gives us a very flexible way of playing.
- rules are clear, just few quibbles for which I found here Q&A file already posted
- few units: the turns are fast and furious
- no stacking problem: one one unit per hex
- a lot of fun; once started I have problem to stop... got pleasantly hooked :-)) I don't know yet how it plays with an opponent but playing solitaire cannot stop playing... 
recommended to people like me, with reduced playing time, reduced brain power to study heavy rules, loving eastern front, few units and wishing lot of fun

Like Holdfast: Korea this seems to get the historical feel of the campaign.  The Germans do much better if they stick to a strategy (unlike the historical German choice).  It's neat to see large numbers of Russian blocks disappear from the board when they are successfully surrounded.  Playing the Russian side has a different feel.  Lose half a dozen armies to envelopment?  Oh well, just throw in a dozen more.  Weather plays a big role in this game and the Germans really need to move hard and fast when the opportunity presents itself.  I'll pick up the third game in the series (Holdfast: North Africa) as soon as I work on my backlog of new games.

Nice game, plays in under 3 hours, very short rule set that is only about a ten minute read. The rules are well written and some nice elements such as the use of resource points and the way that only Russian infantry roll a number of attack dice equal to their current strength, while everything else has fixed rates.

It looks to be the first of a series of similar games, so good news for gamers.

Easy, quick playing... but does it have the replay value? Not yet clear...

I'm not sure about this one yet. It's definitely a unique (in a good way) take on the block war game system. And it's packs in a lot of game for such a short rulebook. My main reservations is the replay value. The set up is effectively always the same, and the players are trying to do the same sort of things; there aren't things to vary it from one game to the next. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
A very enjoyable game that provides both sides with a lot of tension:  the German always feels like he is on the verge of victory while the Russian feels impending doom.  However, time/space seems to be on the side of the Russians.

The use of the blocks definitely adds to tension because the German is kept guessing on where the Russian is weak. Combat is resolved using the "buckets of dice" methodology were a 5 or 6 kills infantry and a 6 only kills armor.

A quirk of this combat system is that troops defending in cities/fortified cities get *more* dice, rather than the attacker getting less dice. I think the game designers were trying model how Stalingrad and Leningrad turned into meat-grinders; the attacker is probably going to take a lot of casualties taking a fortified city.

The only thing keeping me from giving the game a higher rating is the map.  It is bland and looks "state-of-the-art" from about 1975.  It is a shame that such as excellent game is blemished by such an uninspired map: it is 2015 and tremendous developments have taken place in graphics production.

RATING: 9.5
I love the Holdfast system here, it works great for giving the gamer a stripped down system of rules that does not bog the game down. simplistic...Yes, but the strategy is unbelievably realistic and highly functional in recreating what the Germans and Russians had to face in term of the really tough choices. The fog of war that the block system generates is excellent! The Resource Points make an obvious choice extremely tough to execute and still have resources left over for other parts of the front. Very difficult for Germany to "win", but that is all part of the historical realism of this game. Looking for a great game system to get into that doesn't have a giant book of rules(I believe this rule book is only three pages after you take out the pictures and designer comments). This is without a doubt my next great game system for historical war board games!

[b]HoldFast: Russia[/b] is a gentle introduction to hex and counter wargaming. It's a simple block wargame that uses the hex and counter conventions of hex maps, ZOC, supply trace, and out of supply attrition. Very easy to learn and fun to play. The Germans must either win during Operation Barbarossa (i.e. within the first third of the game), before the entrance of significant Soviet reinforcements and arrival of unfavourable weather, or they will inevitably lose.

There's an optional downloadable campaign for the entire Eastern Front from 1941–1945, which illustrates the encirclement operations of the early war Germans and late war Soviets. The Eastern Front significantly expands in width as the Germans advance eastward, spreading the Germans thin. Whilst the reverse means that Germans have a much narrower front to defend when the tables turn against them in Late 1942. The Soviet advance from 1943 onwards will be highly attritional. It's incredibly difficult, but entirely possible, for the Germans to fight the Soviets to a standstill to end in a draw.

[2 plays] Best version of an Eastern Front game I've played. 5 hours including rules. Will go 4 hours or less in the future. 

You can see all of the map and all of the blocks the whole game, a big deal as far as I'm concerned, no messy overcrowded fusterclucks of blocks.

The rules get out of the way of having fun and making meaningful decisions.

RATING: 8
Amazing, realistic nail-biting experience. It is basically a boiled down version of Eastfront (this game would not have happened without it), where combat, supply, command and control is managed through the same, simple economy of ressource points.

It gives some very true to life results, and compared to Eastfront and No Retreat! (which are also great games), you actually have a chance of reaching and taking Stalingrad in this game.

It is design for effect at its best. For those caring about history (of which I am one) Leningrad is too easy to take, however. It's a necessity I guess with the very simple victory conditions of taking 2 out of 3 major cities. It keeps the game simple though, and it really makes the german player drive hard at Moscow and Stalingrad, instead of gaining points for smaller objectives and destroying units.

Mechanics-wise, tanks being hit on 6's creates ahistorical and gamy tactics of only attacking tanks with tanks. Also, it just feels weird that cities and fortress cities gives the defender extra dice, but the attacker hits the defender unhindered.

Smooth light rules set. Clever mechanics allow for real blitzkrieging. I'd call this light medium in terms of rules but upped it medium because the actual game play requires a bit of serious thought. I need to play it more to get a better sense of the game, but so far this seems like a great light wargame.

Very easy to learn, this one still offers lots of choices and a decent historical feel. More for beginner wargamers; it leaves out aspects such as retreats, breakthroughs and sea movement, focusing on the low-level basics. My one game so far ground to a long attrition-fest fairly quickly, and the tight map makes such a thing less than thrilling after a while. Component-wise, the value for money is pretty dubious; you're going to want to bring in your own small pieces to mark units as you use them for movement and combat, as well as cities you've taken--and the more dice you can provide yourself, the better. Despite the minimalism, I look forward to more like this, if only because of the oh-so-welcome simplicity.

Fantastically simple, elegant system. The only question is whether it will stand up to repeated plays. Also, I wish the board went a little further east.

Hmm, now nearing my third play and I'm less charmed. Still love how easy it is and what a great VASSAL PBEM game it is, but I'm thinking that there are a small number of viable strategies to use for each side.

Just got this, based on high praise.

Block game with a hex map on the Barbarossa invasion of the USSR by Germany.

Small, very manageable game on a vast subject. Still a good 3 hrs to play, but not too bad for getting a treatment of the eastern front. Very simple rules. Yet accounts for weather effects, zones of control, and resource and movement points. Supply lines are implemented simply but in a way that makes supplies critical.

Combat is different from Columbia system. Not tied to unit strength (so hits don't affect combat effectiveness). Hits are also tied to the type of unit being attacked and are completely independent of the unit that is doing the attacking. No multiple rounds of combat. Just defender/attacker rolls followed by simultaneous damage. Simpler and quicker, to be sure, especially with a stacking limit of only 1 block per hex. Compare that to a 3 round battle between 2 super-stacks of blocks in, say, Crusader Rex, which also has tactical nuances such as combat order (initiative rating) and options for retreat, withdrawal, sieges, etc. Hold Fast focuses less on combat itself, completely stripping tactics out of the equation, and more on strategy and the big strategic decisions and movements a commander would be making. 

Great economy of rules complexity to still capture a surprisingly deep simulation of the Barbarossa campaign! While EastFront by Columbia might be a bigger and more elaborate block game treatment of this subject, i think this is a better east game for me right now... much shorter and more manageable and therefore more likely to get played.

This was my first Worthington block game. Not super impressed by their quality. I often bitch about Columbia Games' low production values, so I have to be fair and knock Worthington for this, too. They appear to be emulating Columbia's treatment: no mounted map, similar sleeve style box, etc. The game is honestly very objectively overpriced on its own, but even compared to a Columbia, the map is blander, the blocks smaller and lighter (possibly a benefit to keep the board from getting crowded), and the stickers feel cheaper. Plus fewer blocks and no cards. So where is the $60 price tag coming from? The box itself feels like a box a tie or scarf would come in.

On the plus side, the rules are full color on glossy paper and there is a very nice player aid card (though only 1 of them, and 2 would have been better). Wish Columbia would do player aids, so kudos there. Still, GMT has done a better job than either company (Pax Baltica), and Academy Games (Strike of the Eagle) has truly mopped the floor with all of them in this regard by producing a game that is not only cheaper, but 10X higher quality in production

Way more fun that it should be. Not one I would have picked by myself, but playing with someone else convinced me. Good intro wargame, though the Russian side is not the most exciting to play and the German side pretty unforgiving.

Very streamlined and elegant representation of the German offensive against Russia up to December 42.

The way to reach the objectives on the German side is not entirely clear to me yet but the game plays smoothly and gives a good feel of the overall operations and challenges without getting bogged in minute details. Replaces East Front II.

Low rules overhead - best block game I have played

Need more plays but a lot of fun -- only complaint is the weak components, including only one player aid and a sorry RP track that is actually the back of the box

I paid a premium and wish the bits (minus the blocks) were a bit better

Am I sad I bought though?  Hell no

Great

Love the system. So far only I have only gone solo with this game but love it and can't wait to go face to face with a few of my eager comrades, the fog of war factor using the block system giving it added depth.  Going head to head with the  Option for continuing the game past January 1943 looks interesting too.

I bought this game and gave it to my 15 year old son [2015], as a gift. It is a block game on the Russian front during WW II. As the Russians you need to holdfast until reinforcements arrive and as the Germans you need to aggressively advance and capture key objectives before the Russian reinforcements arrive. This seems easy, until the bad weather slows your advance to a crawl. This game is enjoyable, changes tactics as the game progresses and the victor is usually determined in the last few turns.

Simplicity at its best.  Strategic level Army movement, low unit counts, fast play.  Don't look for details in this one as it's not a "monster" game on the subject.  Perhaps an even lighter treatment than Blocks in the East by Columbia Games.

Chaotic block game that [i]could[/i] be a good introduction to light wargaming, if only it were shorter and a bit more varied.

There's stuff that's powerfully pleasant, such as the RP spending system, the turn structure, weather brutality, and the overwhelming dice assault.  But the units are samey and the single-scenario limitation is a major setback.

I still have [i]No Retreat! The Russian Front[/i] and [i]EastFront[/i] sitting (mostly) unplayed on my shelf, so there's no reason to own this as well.

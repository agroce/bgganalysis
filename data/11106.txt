GAME: Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader

RATING: 6
A wonderous and baffling parade of ideas, more than a game.  The 40K universe has been compelling ever since, but the core mechanics haven't improved much.

Awesome game!  The flavour and richness of the game matures with age.  Only if GW would bring back this fine masterpiece for those devout fans.

RATING: 6
The first edition of WH40k. It has a more vibrant universe and background, but the mechanics are not nearly as clean. They are very open to abuse. This would make a better combat orientated RPG, with a good GM.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Much better than the later editions. Of course, it's also almost to roleplaying game levels, too...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Suitably dark and yet tongue-in-cheek in style, much better than the plain and boring commercialism of later editions. The rules are not exactly clear everywhere and could do with a bit of streamlining, but that's not a problem with the freeform approach this edition has taken. Warhammer at its best.

RATING: 8
The original WH40K Rogue Trader book (art, setting, and background) was very cool and very inspirational, and although the product line has suffered some unfortunate mutations since then, I still love the original book, along with the Compendium and the Compilation, and will never sell them. This game, along with the original Adeptus Titanicus and Space Marine, helped introduce me to the hobby of miniatures gaming.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
The very first rules for 40K had that quasi-roleplaying feeling that was never transmitted to its descendants. Too bad I got this years later, when everybody played with new versions...

The rules are great when used as originally written - for playing small scenarios with a Gamemaster. Unfortunately the game line was soon focused on tournament-style armylists and unimaginative battles.

RATING: 6
The old warhorse.  I got it as a Christmas present at 14 and now look at me.  This iteration was not very user-friendly, although it offered many options and innumerable random tables.  Still, you've got to love it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Only slightly better than the newer 40k.  It's archaic you-go/I-go system hurts it but it is barely playable with the 10 to 15 models a side that it was intended for. The points system is tanked and psykers and powerful equipment could screw a game. It really gets destroyed when "armies" come into play, see Warhammer 40K 4th. edition to see where that HELL goes...gah.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
In spite of the rating, I would likely never play this anymore. The 2nd edition just did a lot of things better mechanically, and had a more workable points system for force selection.  Still, Rogue Trader was damn cool (in a "kitchen sink" kind of way).

RATING: N/A
Played a bunch in high school. It was a lot of fun then: proxies and kit-bashing galore. The point system was ludicrously easy to break, so don't go looking for balance, but it had a nifty background and played well enough.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The original, initially valiant attempt to reconcile RPGs and miniature wargaming. Unfortunately, it didn't come off. Though GW's dark universe is rich and appealing, the systems were, at this stage, rather clunky. Rules were vague or sometimes nonsensical, and characters (particularly psykers) were all-powerful. This often made for games in which only two models were left standing in a wasteland blasted with plasma-fires, psionic cyclones and temporal distortions. Victory seemed hollow, since it was often due to some insanely destructive weapon/spell. Good effort though, and essential for 40K completists (which I ain't).

The game rules were pretty decent over all, the initial rules had design rules that were flaky and ultimately could not be used.  The Company promised updates to "correct" that problem but they consistantly ignored the issue completely or glossed over it when ever it came up.  It was hoped that with the White Dwarf mag that rules updates would appear and correct the issue there but alas, the pattern was being established.  With the release of 1st edition there was promise of "clarified" design rules and "fixing" of various "broken" rules. Again the trend continues, the biggest problem that I had was not so much with the game (okay I did have some problems with the game) but with the Company that produced it.
Games Workshop promises much but delivers little.
This has been their history from day one and thru the many rebirths.  They promise this rule fix in this update or a supp for this race (Stunties/Dwarfs) and that race, and only produce a third of them or none of them (Stunties/Drarfs)and then decide "ooo we need to change the rules so we can put in this other race(this or that Chaos race) instead of what we have been promised for the last eleven months."  Now 80% of the minis you purchased along the way are not usable in the "New and Improved" rules version. 
Yes I got suckered into three revisions before I finally said enough was enough.
That and having 1/2 of my army stolen from me while at a game store did not help.  

What ever you do don't play any of this company's games.  They will sucker you in for a year or so then suddenly "revise" the rules enough that most of the minis you have are no longer usable in the new Revised edition.  They will promise much and deliver little.  Their prices are way out of porportion to value (even tho they will try desparately to convince you otherwise using trickery and slick verbage) These buggars are masters at removing coin from your purse whilst you thank them for doing it or feel guilty for questioning their "noble motives".

1st Edition

RATING: 10
Far superior to subsequent iterations. The fluff that existed around the game between 1988-1990 was perfect. As the setting became more fleshed out, it lost its edge. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
If only, if only...this one really should have been an RPG with miniature rules. Instead, they focus on the wargaming aspect and then burden the thing down with a ton of extraneous, complicated, and crunchy material. The artwork and fluff in the original book, however, is the BEST of the WH40K series. Can't wait for the RPG

RATING: N/A
I found the rules somewhat convoluted, but later editions of this game address that problem somewhat (or at least organize the rules better). Once you understand the rules, the gameplay is relatively fun and furious, with light to medium amounts of strategy. My main concern is that the prices of the miniatures (and Games Workshop's WYSIWYG rules) make this game very expensive to play - especially when you need to update your forces on a regular basis to take advantage of, or counter, new rules and/or units. I am told that there are various paper miniatures available online, but I have not come across any of them yet.

Armies: Space Marines; Orks

RATING: 6
A precious keepsake at this point.  40K barely formed.

Full of so much awesome though, a wilderness that was scaled back to become the 40k that everyone knows.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
This is the system that kicked GW and Warhammer into the mainstream. Though perhaps more complex in places, than 40K currently is, I have a real longing to drag  this set of rules out of the closet. Nostalgia more than anything else.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
As the original WH40K game it was based on small squad based actions, very much a skirmish game.  I had many, many battles and a huge collection of minis to play with.  The rules were a bit sketchy to use but it has a great dark future feel, great art and background. Lots of unit customizing and individuality. No army lists in this one, the large scale battles came later with White Dwarf articles and the WH40K Compendium.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This is the game that turned me on to miniatures.  The customizable rules were pretty good, but I don't think they were very balanced, and the lack of real army lists made building an army very very time-consuming.  However, this version had some of the best background fluff, and I was disappointed when a lot of it was dropped/changed later.

RATING: 9
I feel like this original edition had much more personality than the current version. There was a lot more freedom when building your armies. I think when Games Workshop figured out their business model (i.e.- sell the same thing over and over, with minor changes, to make tons of cash), this all fell to the wayside. It wasn't perfect, though, I feel that the way the rules are now written, and the way the game plays, is much more approachable for the mass market.

A classic for 40K gamers. Its fun to leaf through the book and look at 40K's humble beginnings but the game is not very playable. The point cost system in particular has no balance at all. It is as if they couldn't quite make up their minds if 40K was supposed to be a roleplaying game or a wargame.

Not well balanced or concieved as far as the usual 40k stuff goes, in that two players generating army lists and then fighting will not create a good time.  However, I think it could be good (much better than standard 40k) with a GM and pre-planned scenarios.  It packs in more fluff than any subsequent edition, and for much less money (at the time).

RATING: 7
The original - and with some expansion tweaks still imo the best version. You can keep the uber simplified, full of special one offs the new version has become. I'll stick to this.
The original book is well worth it for the fluff alone - a table top wargame with a heavy leaning towards wanting to become a lite RPG.
Interesting that the much later Inquisitor almost went back to the WH40k roots and to an RPG driven table top combat system.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Lovely setting and a very nice production, but rough around the edges.  Take the basic set up of Orks versus Marines - the original Space Marines had toughness 3, the Orks 4 - as it turned out, Toughness 4 was worth much more than the Marines' slightly better powered armor save.

A book full of marvellous ideas, but it took many issues of White Dwarf (not to mention several supplements with radical changes to the combat and vehicle rules) to be smoothed into a good game.

In 1987 I was a "serious" 20 year old gamer playing the likes of Challenger and Harpoon, whilst Rogue Trader was the game that the "kids" played, so why do I have a copy of this in my collection?

In reality I would probably never actually use the rules themselves, I find the Warhammer mechanism very clunky,  but the book itself is a wonderful bit of nostalgia.

IMHO the best of the Warhammer 40,000 editions. The rules were pretty solid, you didn't need millions of extra books or billions of miniatures and the games were more fun. The players had to be more creative and the addition of a GM to make sure everything went well and write cool scenarios was amazing. A well missed game, it's a shame people will soon be on the 5th edition designed so you'll need loads of extra stuff to even play the game.

Warhammer 40k in it's many incarnations is certainly miniature converter's dream. Too bad the game isnät that great, but old RPG like rogue trader sure has some fun stuff in it.

RATING: 9
I still love this. Is it unwieldy? Yes. Would it be impossibly slow to play with modern sized armies? Yes. Point is so much and so many games and gamers owe this a LOT. Rick Priestly was a genius. This incorporated everything you could possibly need for a game, in order to incorporate it. I loved that there was a games master driven narrative where you'd suddenly find your marines flung high into the air due to an alien plant. This had something sadly missing from most of the GW range from late 90s onwards, a sense of humour. It didn't take itself too seriously, realising it was escapism, dark and dystopian, but tongue in cheek at times. It was halfway between a skirmish game and an RPG and you could lovingly craft your own armies, create your own characters, watch them develop, then qrieve as an ambull stampede crushed them in a tragic unforeseen turn of events! 

I'd suggest if you can get a copy of this, or the 30th annivwrsaey edition that you do, reading it alone playing it makes it worthwhile, but drop me a line if you fancy a game, my first edition marines and orks are always keen for a scrap!

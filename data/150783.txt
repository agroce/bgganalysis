I love the game. One of the best gateway games you can get. I've played dozens of times and the new players don't weigh down the experiences. The comments that say it's just a game of luck most likely didn't take the time to learn the strategy.

I have not played with the included expansions because I feel the game shines in the depth through simplicity it has. Highly recommend, especially if you are part of a group with either new or lightweight players.

Played with 6 people, it felt completely random and the game ended way too soon.  Due to how hard it was to get near-complete information, the group I played with decided to just hold on to high point cards and guess once the game ended.  If you started with two syringes, there was almost no chance you would be able to use both of them on vials before the game ended, which also sucked.

Would not need to own, but would probably play again, maybe.

If you enjoy light games and have family that likes games that are light but also super over-played (looking at you uno)this game is perfect. It's fun for those deep-thinkers who like involved games and those who enjoy a lighter game. I guess I can't speak for everyone on this, but I'd bet overall most would enjoy it.

Okay, so you can't eliminate luck.  Full disclosure.  Once you get past that, this is one of the better microgames of 2015 so far.  Antidote has excellent strategic depth for such a fast game, and rewards your ability to "read" the other players.  Makes an excellent ongoing lunch hour game, as the point tallies are most meaningful when accumulated over several games.  Then - when you're tired of the base game, integrate the (included) expansions for a variety of cooperative and semi-cooperative options.  

Tired of the pure blind randomness of Werewolf, and drowning in hidden role games?  Need a new light strategy (or party) game?  Give Antidote a try.

I have a surprising amount of fun playing this game, even though I wouldn't call it a very well designed game. For some reason, I really got into the theme. I think you need to add some of the expansions to the game to make it meaty enough in order to have enough information to make it a proper deduction game. I would not play again without the clinic trials. Without them, there just isn't enough information being traded between the players, so you often just need to go with your gut feeling. As such, the game often feels too random. Player A might get dealt two X cards and a syringe at the beginning of the game, and player B might just get a bunch of numbered cards. Guess who is more likely to win? Hint: It's not player B!

RATING: 6.5
This is actually a fun little deduction game that shouldn't be taken too seriously.  It allows for some fun moments, especially when playing with the Clinical Trial and Placebo cards.  It's filler, to be sure, so don't expect anything with weight when playing it - this is all about just having a good time at the table.

That being said, the set-up is a bit too fiddly for what the game is and I honestly can't see another solution to it.  It's just a lot of sorting and shuffling before you can start playing, which kinda makes it feel like a chore.  For that, it doesn't quite reach the level of "I wanna play it!"

Came across this one on a table at a gaming weekend. The first thing I noticed was the excellent design and great colors.

I rated it a buy given the $10 cost.

A pleasant enough, quick deduction game. Players must either play or pass cards until they have gradually dwindled their hand down to just one. Hopefully, that last card matches the antidote (or you're out) and has the highest value (and you win). Nothing particularly compelling or offensive. Fine filler.

[b]2 Player Review:[/b] 

A sweet (despite what the theme might imply), charming little deduction game that is over very quickly, leading to an inevitable rematch. Yuki remarked that the theme reminds him of Pandemic, and while it does me as well, there is a lot more playful `take that` here than any co-op. 

The idea is to discover the exact kind of toxin that has infected everyone, and get that exact antidote into your hand before the other players force the game to end. While the game-play is clever, it`s not incredibly deep, making it a perfect filler or great to pull out with non-gamers (I imagine, not yet actually tried it myself).

It plays incredibly well with 2 players, and the dummy player actually adds a nice layer of strategy as you try to guess what the other player has just put in there and decide whether you should waste a turn to find out if your suspicions are correct. 

[b]Pros:[/b]

- Plays in around 15 minutes
- The "Aha!" moment is satisfying every-time
- Very quick set-up

[b]Cons:[/b]

- Not so deep, but deep enough for a good filler
- I feel like my hand is a little too full at the start of each game, but that`s quickly remedied.

Initial Rating: 5.0 (June 2015)

I have never heard of Antidote, the first time was right before we played it and when I learned it was a deduction game I was keen to play it. It is a fun deduction game and I enjoyed that part of it, however I dislike that even if you know the correct answer you can lose solely by luck. To win, you need the highest card of the correct color and taking it from another player (or drawing it) is pure luck. What I mean with this, is that I feel if you play well you can put yourself in a position in which “maybe” you will win the game, but you need luck in your favor to close the deal. I don’t enjoy this.

I liked that you need to choose how to reveal the information in your hand, also the play is simultaneous, making it a fast paced and short game (its main appeal).

The art of the cards is ok.

Bottom line, Antidote is a game I would play if requested. I’m curious about the variants. I enjoy the deduction aspect but hate the high luck/chaos factor. Even if you deduce correctly you are not much closer to victory and you can still win by luck alone (even if you didn’t knew the correct answer).

This was fun.  A short deduction game where you can't really deduce the answer (if your group is not cooperative), so you're left to rely on hints from others' dropped cards.  I'd like to try it further with different groups.

Have played the beginner verient in a larger group and we enjoyed it quite a bit. Easy to learn and great art on the cards. I haven't added the advanced part of the game yet so I'm holding off on a rating until then. So far a very welcome addition.

* Kickstarted! *

Seven colour cards, based on the number of players plus one, and some special cards to make the dealing even -- with the catch being that one of the "plus one" cards is pulled out of the deck and you gain points by matching your number card to to it at the end of the game. It's therefore logic deduction with the twist that you don't get to see the plus ones when they get discarded unless you use the special cards. The Kickstarter edition comes with some additional special cards to help keep things interesting.

PLUS: easy to learn, focuses on what other players do
MINUS: not much beyond a guessing game really

Lots of guessing involved with 3 players, but still a great time!  Rather enjoyed it and I like the look of the game.

Played with 6 and 7.  STILL a lot of guessing involved.  Not sure if we are doing something wrong, or if our group is so competitive that sharing info isn't happening like it should be.  hmmm....  idk.   

Game looks great, plays up to 8, and has a small footprint.  All that is great... but does it work?

This game has everything a deduction game should have but it just feels like it's missing something to make it great.  Or maybe it has too much of what makes a deduction game; Secrets and info to remember.  One on one trades are essential to the game and the rule book doesn't emphasize this enough.
The expansions that come in the box are needed to make the game fun.  I'll play this game if someone wants but others like Coup, Avalon, or Werewolf are so much more fun.

First play with six players.  None of really knew what to do.  The strategy was a little opaque. I think more plays might be needed.  I rather liked it but I think adding the placebo and clinical trial cards are necessary.  In our game no one drank the right antidote, so we either were doing it wrong or there isn’t enough information learned by the end of the game. What is the point of trading cards one on one?  I finally offered someone a trade X for an X.  He agreed and gave me a numbered antidote card.  It was funny.  I think the game needs more table talk but I am not sure how.

A great bluffing and deduction game with a great theme. I played this as a two player with a silent third player variant as outlined in the game rules. I found it to be an interesting concept with lots of interesting plays throughout. Lots of tension even with two players and the theme fits perfectly with the game style. 

Will definitely get this to the table again as a warm up before playing other games. The game includes some expansions but the base game stands strong on its own. Getting the set up phase of the game right is critical.

RATING: 7
Surprisingly fun and clever social/logical deduction game. 

The only real issue I have with this game is that there's a lot of imbalance caused by the starting cards each player is dealt. If you're dealt two "X" cards, you can simply hold on to one of them for the entirety of the round, thus limiting the amount of information flowing, and making it impossible for anyone but you to completely deduce the correct antidote. 

On the flipside, if you're dealt two syringe cards instead, then no one will want to exchange information with you (since you have none), and your syringes aren't useful until you actually have information. All you can really do is speed up your imminent loss by always forcing everyone to discard, and hope that all the other card-exchanging social butterflies you're playing with haven't had enough time to hone down the antidote. 

We've recently tried a house variant to mitigate this by always dealing each player one X card and one syringe at the start, and it seems to make the game a lot more fair, albeit making the first few turns slightly more predictable.

After a few plays with my PnP version and several different groups, I'm enjoying this and itching for more.  Each round very quickly gets you going with a little information and I like that the known to unknown information ratio throughout the round seems to transition at a good pace -- I usually feel like I have enough info to make decent decisions but still uncertain overall.  The last few cards can result in a really good tension of trying to determine how much to trust the other players' cards.  I don't think I was ever 100% sure at the end of a round, which is good, although I still picked the right antidote each time.  I was also able to make a few clever plays to throw off other players, which was fun.  Really looking forward to the final art -- the PnP art has some color issues but the final art is incredibly impressive.

A delightful puzzle game with a wonderful theme. Tensions rise as a deadly chemical spreads among the researchers present at the gaming table. Only the smartest and sneakiest researcher will survive. This game uses a hint of logic and a dash of theft to uncover the true nature of the deadly chemical. 
Players trade, steal and observe each other's research to hopefully develop the correct cure and save their lives. Many times I have gone with a hunch as friends have bluffed and double bluffed in an attempt to confuse and confound others at the table. Overall a splendid game that hasn't had nearly enough time out with my gaming group.

This game is so simple, I mean after 2 plays I know how to predict the antidote with no problems...after 8 games, he still didn't. Fun with more players. The "roles" and the "clinical trials" are, so so, some times they work, sometimes they don't add to the game. The roles definitely  require more players.

I REALLY want to like this game more, and I do have to try it a few more times, but there was a time in the game where is seemed like it may never end!

The way you change cards around to try and find more information about which antidote is the correct one to swill gets redundant if no one is pushing for the end, which could be a major problem if the only people who had seen enough info, are clueless.

Sort of a social deduction game that concentrates more on the deduction than the social. The trading action does not work at all but makes more sense if you just rule that trades have to be accepted every time.

Backed it as a Kickstarter. I've mainly played it as 2-player, which requires a 'dummy' variant. The artwork is great. I would love the game if it weren't for the dummy mechanic.

Played this with a group of friends over the weekend... and I think we found our new favorite group game.
It was very easy to teach everyone how to play. Played two rounds with the basic rules and everyone got the hang of it! So, we then added some of the expansion cards and they picked up on that after another two rounds.
In all, it took maybe 10 minutes for them to earn the basics and a couple of rounds to understand how to start developing a win strategy. 
Great game!

It's a fun theme - everyone gradually discarding down to one card, which represents the antidote you're going to drink in the hope that it's the correct one to save you from the toxin running rampant through your locked lab. But the mechanics don't provide much of interest. Each player starts out with knowledge of a subset of which antidotes (ie suit colors) are useless, and therefore can be discarded. You want to end with the highest valued card in the suit that's been secretly randomly designated, Cluedo style, at the start of the game. A turn is to do a trade, or all players pass a card to their right/left, or all players discard one, carefully noting what other players are discarding and passing as indicators to what other antidotes are known by the other players as useless. But are they misleading you because they have two of that suit?! It's obviously good to trade for antidote knowledge, but if everyone does it continuously then everyone will know what the missing suit is automatically and it's a win-lottery as to who happened to get dealt the highest card in that suit. The game feels more fun by restricting trades, forcing players to infer knowledge, and by adding the variants which provide more complicated winning conditions for bigger but riskier points. I'll play it for the theme, but it otherwise feels like you just want to accelerate the discards to see how it ends as there's not enough game in the game.

A quick filler game.  I got in on the Kickstarter for this one.  I hoped it would be better than it is. Still it is an enjoyable card game of trying to find which suit is the antidote.  You must "drink" the last vial card you have in your hand.  If it is not the suit of the secret card that was set aside at the outset, you have just taken poison...and well, you know. Colorful artwork and unique idea.

RATING: 6.5
Fun, simple deduction game. Suffers at high player counts since there's just too much hidden info to keep track of, but you want enough players to introduce enough entropy as well, so the deduction isn't so easy, and finding that balance is a bit tough. Some of the extension modules are better than others as well.

Tried this with my group and it just didn't work. Cooperating is risky, since you can be betrayed or still not have enough information, so everyone just ended up not cooperating to minimize losses, making it not really a game anymore.

RATING: 7
Enjoyable game, reminiscent of Divinare, one of my favourite guessing/deduction card games, but this one seems just a little bit wonkier and somehow more breakable.

After one game (6 players), it feels like imbalance in opening hands could be a potential issue - those who were dealt 2 syringes and no Xs each round felt aggrieved - but by the end the group verdict was generally positive so this will certainly get some more plays.

KS Backer:

A quick playing light-weight deduction game in the same vein as Resistance and Avalon.  The theme is novel: everyone at the table has been poisoned, and must determine, through a series of card shifts and trades and discards, which antidote to drink.  The problem is, no one has perfect information about which specific toxin they are poisoned by, and so, some players may die while others live.  
While this sounds intriguing and exciting, the truth is that the game itself is a fairly rudimentary exercise in how co-operative your group is. If you're working together, the likelihood of survival is fairly high (at which point the game becomes a strange "numbers based" affair with VP's and multiple games...oddly removed from the carefully constructed theme).  If not...some of you will die.  Either way, the base game is pretty vanilla and sort of anti-climactic.  We played three 6-player games and by the last game, the consensus was, "oh...I died.  Bummer," or "oh...I lived.  Oh, you had a higher point card?  Bummer.  I guess you win."
Maybe the expansions (which are included in the KS box) will help, but complexity and new rules rarely alter a base experience for the better, particularly when there's little interest in playing the base game again.  
Also, it bears mention that the cards are cheap, cheap, cheap cardstock (think sub-Gamewright tin can games), and will require sleeving if you intend to play much.
The good news is...you probably won't need to sleeve it.  
Not a terrible effort by a reasonably new designer (the theme in particular shows tremendous creativity), just not as good of a game as it could have been.

RATING: 5
An interesting little deductive game. Unfortunately I don't think the rules really work to create as tense of an experience as is desired--largely because players rarely have a desire to share information with others, coupled with the virus cards being randomly dealt out, often one player has far more info than the others. It's a quick game though so none of these are huge issues. But ultimately the game is thoroughly average. I'll play here and there, but this isn't the type of game that really gets me having a great time.

A unique take on deduction games. Like most games in this category it works much better with talkative gamers who can play semi-cooperatively. If all anyone does is advance the game by discarding cards, everyone will just drink a random antidote, which is no fun at all. Trade! Make deals! Be social! Add in the lab romance cards if you have to. They can give players that extra nudge.

Not a deduction game.  Inference at best.  There is just too much chaos and chance to be able to formulate a strategy.  You either get a good hand or you lose.

A premissa é ótima: caiu um composto químico venenoso no laboratório e os jogadores têm que tomar o antídoto para não morrer. Só que não é cooperativo. Cada um tem um pouco de informação, e todo precisam trocar e blefar para beber o antídoto correto entre vários possíveis.

No gameplay em si, achei que é um pouco fácil de deduzir qual é o composto certo, e acaba que quem tem na mão a carta mais valiosa do antídoto sempre ganha.

Ainda assim, é bem divertido de jogar.

This is a small card deduction game.  In this game all players are lab assistants and a vial of some deadly virus has been broken.  The goal is to finish the game with the antidote to that virus in your hand.  At the start of the game one of the 8 possible viruses is removed from the deck, that's the one we are all infected with, then the remaining viruses are shuffled up with a deck of antidote cards (each virus has an equal number of antidote cards in the deck equal to the number of players) and a number of syringe cards (equal to the number of players), then dealt evenly to all players.

The game is played by going around the table and each player in turn picking one action out of 4 available.  Either they force all players to discard a card (virus cards are discarded face down), all players pass a card to the left or right, they can make a deal with another player for a one-for-one trade (such as you give me a virus, I give you one), or playing a syringe card which lets you pick up a discarded card or pick one randomly from a player's hand.  This goes on until each player has only one card left and then you check who survived by having the correct antidote in their hand.

I felt like the rules as written were a bit imbalanced and there is an easy way to balance them.  First of all instead of shuffling all the cards up and dealing them out I think each player should start with one syringe and one virus card.  Syringes are very powerful and one player starting with 2+ of them while others have none gives them a clear advantage.  The same can be said for one player starting with 2+ viruses (eliminating possibilities) while another starts with none and MUCH less information.  Also, the rules state that when multiple players have the antidote, the one with the highest number is the winner but we played that all survivors were winners because the number you end up with is almost COMPLETELY random.

Even with these fixes though it is too bland and easily solved of a game.  It almost always happens that the antidotes discarded belong to viruses that those players know they aren't infected with.  The only way a good antidote is discarded is if a player has multiples and even then you see much less of that antidote than any others so the deduction becomes very easy and the game becomes very boring.  But a whole game also only lasts about 15 minutes, so there's that.

Trade information and hope to have the right card in hand at the end. Technically there is information to be gained from what people discard, but since no-one is making a fully informed decision until very late on the value of that information is questionable at best.

Get dealt 2 syringes and you're probably in trouble as you're relying on others to discard X cards before you can do much with them unless you just want to hope for a lucky draw from someone's hand (a bad idea generally, but possibly worthwhile right at the end).

Antidote is not a terrible game, but it's not one I can ever really see me playing again.

Unique fun social deduction game. I had a lot of fun with this and will definitely be playing more of it I especially want to include the expansion cards that come with base game. It is a game that needs people to play it many times to get down the best strategies for determining the antidote. When playing with new comers or those with little logic it can frustrating as you can often feel like you are just guessing. My score for this game may go up if I ever get to play it at its full potential.

"You decide when the game ends" is an interesting mechanic in theory, but here (as in Colovini's I Go) makes ambiguity and uncertainty central pivot points in the design. For a deduction game this is certainly necessary, but then you're also trying to fumble together a hand of cards as well which muddies the whole thing.

That the design *works* in general is a testament to it, but for deduction games there are far more and better out there.

(July 2014 after 1 5p game) - Played a base game where the numbers did not matter to the end condition.   We only played one round and found it to be OK.

It is a short deduction type card game with rather simple rules - not a complex game.   

Goal is to end up with the antidote for the game through card exchange, discards, syringe play ,etc.   Would play again.

RATING: 8
One of the best combinations of theme and mechanics that I've had the pleasure to play, and probably one of the best adaptations of a book that I've ever seen. It brings to the table all the main elements that make the universe of Dune such a great scenario: the struggling factions, the endless intrigues and, of course, the unique essence of the planet Arrakis. Everything is reflected by the rules that, even if not always perfect, manage in offering to the players a simple system with a good level of strategy and just a bit of luck. It can be really long and it's difficult to estimate the real duration of a game. Depending on how the various alliances develop, it can be a matter of a couple of hours or it can go on for 4-5 hours. Is it worth the time investment? More than in other cases, it’s definitely a matter of personal taste. Nowadays there are more accessible alternatives for the same category of games, but what really makes Dune stand out is its unique blend of theme and rules. One thing is for sure: you'll spend that whole time negotiating, debating and considering your military opportunities, in a deeply interactive game that doesn't leave much space to downtime. Of course, if you  don’t know the universe depicted by the book the game probably loses at least one point or two, but, despite its age, it’s still a good piece of work.

Avalon Hill version, components of good quality and design (considering their age). It’s worth to mention that here on BGG there is some great homemade material that is definitely worth a look.

Very true to it's theme and the thing I really love about this game is how differently each of the roles play which can provide such a varied experience. However, I find the mechanics all a bit tedious and, unfortunately it just doesn't quite live up to expectation.

One of the best games there is with 6 players (if you have the time), ok with 5.  The factions are wonderfully asymmetric but balanced enough.  Very thematic. The long but variable playing time can be problematic, but Dune is well worth it.

RATING: 4
Dune is basically just an inferior Cosmic Encounter knock off with some really good ideas.  It's inferior because the added complexity distracts from the player interaction. You spend more time fiddling with rules than playing your opponents.

I love the process of bidding for cards--only some players know what everyone is actually bidding for. The combat resolution, including possible traitors, is fantastic. Someone should steal this idea. Bizarrely and unforgivably the combat resolution was modified when FFG publish its Dune knock-off Rex.

Superficially it captures the feeling of the book it's based on. This feeling goes away after a few plays when the CE internals start to manifest in a gamey and un-Dune like fashion. In the end the great ideas are wasted on a game that is too much limited by the source material and its similarity to CE. If you want Dune, read the book. If you want a good game of shifting alliances, play CE. Dune the boardgame fuctions best as a novelty collectible.

Modern efficiency min-maxers will have to play for the long game.  And they may be rewarded!  However, the treacherous and the bold will more often come away with a win.

This game dares people to manage chaos.  Ride the wave or be drowned.  Either way, we're all addicted to the spice.

This game is a ton of fun, but tends to be over very quickly for our group. The first time the sandworm appears, we hold a conference, everyone creates alliances, and the game is pretty much over three turns after that. Alliances are very powerful. I have been on the winning side once, and the losing side once – the first time I played Harkonnen and was the back-stabbiest of players – I also chose my traitors very well. We were able to wipe out the opposition because I had all their major generals as traitors – which was great for us, terrible for them. 

The second game was much closer – in that I played the Guild and was allied with the Emperor. And even though we lost, I was able to nuke an entire city – that alone made the game worth playing. I lost one troop (the guys who set up the nuke), was able to take out twenty enemies troops, and one city was no longer protected from the sandstorm. It was glorious. I will probably never have the chance to nuke the shield wall again... but I will never forget the time I did!

+ The game feels like the books throughout play; The different houses that you can be are excellently thought out and are very different from each other.
- Takes too long to play with the full number of players, but the game isn't as good with less than the full number of players.


Why it's previously-owned:
It's only good with 5 or 6 players and we don't have that many dedicated gamers that get together on a regular basis.  If we had the right play group, I can almost guarantee that this would be top favorite game.

Played this a lot when I was a kid, and had/have fond memories. In adulthood I think the basic rules are the only playable ones, and alliances pretty much ruin the game. Each game also has a significantly variable time length which is annoying. A few rules now really erk me, but I still like the basic combat system. Probably should be left in the past. Best 'Dune' based game I've seen :)

RATING: 7
Very chaotic and unsettling at first, especially with game end conditions that could end the game at any time in an unpredictable way. In fact, our alliance won in the 3 or 4 of a possible 15 rounds. 

I do really like the storm mechanic that destroy everything in it's path (soft reset of the game winning area control spots). And I really like the battle mechanic made of of base units in area (you pick how many you want to use, but make sure to leave at least 1 behind so that you can occupy the space if you win), the power of your leader, and 1 defense and 1 attack treachery card. 

2 hours to go over the rules for first-time players in a 5 player game. Not sure how long the game actually went. I was the mind-controlling, free-deployment-to-planet Bene Gesserit witches. Out of all of Silverbeard's out-of-print games, this is a fantastic find!

I love it, but it evokes some mixed feelings in my gaming group. The rules are arcane in comparison to modern games. There appeared to be some balance issues.

RATING: 7
Good? But not great? Not sure why this is held up as a classic. Actually, scratch that. I know why - it does feel like a modern game that came out in 1979; but it doesn't feel like it would be extraordinary if it came out today. Nevertheless, I enjoyed it. Battle mechanic - adding leaders to your committed troops, the rock-paper-scissors of shields/weapons, that's pretty cool. Deployment feels like it's a bit too difficult; it's expensive to get people to the planet. Assymetric powers are always cool too.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Diplomatic game with lots of gamers interaction. Every side has its strengths and weaknesses.

Tactically this game is a bit on the lean side, however take note that this is a game from 1979. One move action per turn compared with the loads of diplomatic interaction is a bit off balance.

Oddly enough I didn't get a Dune feeling with this game. I have the computer game in mind.

Sadly the armies are just dotlike thingies instead of beautiful designed counters.

RATING: 8.5
A great game, I understand why it deserves its "grail" status. The theme ties in so well to the game, I can't imagine how the FFG re-theme is as good. First play was with four, second with 5, still waiting to play with the full 6. Basic with optional rules seems to work well, in no hurry to try the advanced rules, and I think it would be dull without the optional rules that gives more variable player powers. Fantastic game.

RATING: 6
This is essentially a war game with each player having certain assymetrical powers.  The game uses mechanics and game play to recreate the feeling of an undoubtedly beloved work of science fiction.  Since I have not read Dune, when I played Dune, I was essentially left with experiencing just the game itself, not the sensation of reliving my experience of reading Dune.  As such, I found the game itself to be merely an okay war game, not something I would want to play again, so I have to give it a 6 at best.  

The blind bidding for Treachery cards which are fairly decisive in battles, with one player being able to see what they are, was a weird way to effectively and eventually determine battle results.  I did not care for this mechanic, but it is an interesting game design idea.  Bottom line: if one wanted to play a war game, or a war game with alliances, there are better games.  If one wanted to play a game with assymetric player powers, alliances, and zinging card effect battles, I would go with Cosmic Encounter.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Dune has a very strong theme and some innovative design features, but the game feels old and it's much too long.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Dune does a lot of things right: its extreme asymmetry manages to seem moderately balanced; its combat system is elegant and quick; and in particular, its diplomacy and shared victory conditions smooth out most balance issues and add variability between games. 

However, the game has a significant snowball effect: once you start losing combats, it seems difficult to recover, due to the disproportionate advantages for winning. The winner gets to keep his hero, most treachery cards, and (most egregiously) gets paid for any enemy heroes they kill. The loser kind of gets hosed: not only do they lose their troops, but also treachery cards, which are key to winning combats. The loser tends to be both low on dough and treachery cards at this point, which makes it difficult to win further combats.

Traitor cards are meant to add another variable to perhaps even things out (as well as be conceptually one of the coolest things about the game) but in practice the odds of seeing a relevant traitor was so low as to not bear thinking about. 

Would love to try playing again with a few house rules. Note: we played with a print-and-play version of the game; good luck finding an original copy.

This review might be partially influenced by me getting crushed as fremen, so take it with a grain of spice.

Wow!
Dune has it all. Bluffing. Risk. Alliances, Traitors. Sacrifice. Leadership. Bidding.
Few games ever made have had as many positive attributes as Dune has. Sure, by today&#039;s standards it is overly long and some of the rules (BG co-existence) are laborious, but once players have mastered the rules, the game has more dimension and tension than almost anything on the market today.
Key to play are bidding, bluffing and collection. Players bid for cards that allow them to perform various functions in the game or, more importantly, triumph in battles. You bid to risk your wealth acquiring the tools to triumph...or not!
Conflict resolution is a bluffing system unlike any other game. Leaders make the difference but each player secretly allocates how many precious troops they are willing to sacrifice. Too few and they lose the battle and all is lost anyway. Too many and the victory is Pyrhhic in that other factions will exploit your depleted position. Leadership most often makes the difference in battles, but beware traitors.
The economics of the game revolve around the collection of spice from the surface. Too little collection and everyone is poor and desperate. Too much and some factions (Emperor, Harkonnen) become overly powerful.
Dune is a game of balance and subtgerfuge.
The theme is so much in line with the books that you really take on the mechanics of a faction as if you were the fictional characters.
The real standout of the design is the assymetrical structure of the factions. Some factions are far better than others, but often it depends when in the game: beginning, middle or end. The ebb and flow of power really is like sand dunes shifting. Sweet victories come from sacrifice and risk, but mostly from just simple outmaneuvering and outthinking your opponents.
I don&#039;t reccomend the Spice Harvest expansion. The Duel expansion is better but the one-on-one fighting is boring. You can opt out of that portion and simply use the leaders and new cards/rules to enhance the basic game.
Last point: No game in this database deserves a remake like this one.

Great game. Captures Herbert's Dune exquisitly. The components serve to immerse one in the world of Dune - the Battle Wheeels are an inspired notion ("Wheels within wheels"). The game has it all: player characters, each with their own powers; combat which is simple to grasp, but excruciating in its choices; diplomacy, bluffing, treachery and betrayal; Resources (spice and troops) which must be acquired and managed efficiently; leaders, which are vitally important for combat; a bidding mechanism in which spice is bid on cards that convey special abilities; victory which is based on area control. I preferred a house rule which disallowed Alliance wins.

Heard so much in the past about how Dune was Cosmic Encounter on steroids, and that CE itself was already great. Played CE, admittedly only once, and it went over like a fart in church. Maybe time to revisit. Anyhoo, despite spending at least half the game trying to figure out rules, advanced rules, optional rules, and so on, I thought this one delivered. Probably less than half of that was the game, as the real strength were the player interactions. But the game is what structures that. Remain interested in replaying.

We played this on a game night, and only got through four rounds before we had to go.  The rules were pretty long and complicated, and no one really knew how to play.  The rules never really caught me...I think it's just a bit too heavy for my taste.  I am willing to give it another shot.

I've only played this game once, so my ratings may go up for this, but I was heavily impressed with the level of diplomacy and position-shifting involved in this game.  Alliances shift often, so you may be on the verge of victory one turn, and then all of a sudden, in a "loser" alliance the next turn.  Powers keep it interesting - particularly trying to gage when and who the Bene Gesserit want to win.  It does appear that the powers are slightly unbalanced (with the Fremen appearing to be weakest).

I played the BG's the first and only time, so would be interested in playing again with a different race.

Purchased 1/08 from Noble Knight games. Unpunched 2nd printing.

Played for the first time in a 6 player 4/2010. Very similar in many ways to Cosmic Encounter, but very good at capturing the 'wheels within wheels' aspect of treachery, shifting alliances and Byzantine complexity which makes the books such a classic read. Unfortunately for me I played pretty badly in my first try out of the game...so back to Mentat school for me!

RATING: 6
3/21/16: I play this pretty much exclusively because my friends like it.  The emperor together with the guild seems to be a very powerful faction.  In our last 6 player game they teamed with a third, and the Guild ended up with 39 spice.

3/19/15: Heavy and dripping with theme.  Asymetrical powers which are very true to the book.  Over 30 years old and still innovative.  Multiple mechanics make this a very complex game with a lot of tension.  Can end relatively quickly or can go for a long time.  Direct conflict, treachery, and going after scarce resources.  Spice is crazy tight.  Last game we played we used the optional rule that spice beefed up the soldiers, and that made spice even harder to come by.  Best with 6.

This game is nothing short of amazing. It loses two points for the following reasons: 1) I imagine it is not as good with less than 6. 2) Components and art.

Other than that, I haven't even read/seen the book/movie, and I was absolutely drawn in. The way all of the powers worked differently was phenomenal. I really did feel like I was playing the spiritual predecessor to all of my favorite games.

RATING: 7
I've owned this game since the early 1980s. Dune only touched on the philosophical concepts Frank Herbert explored in greater detail in subsequent novels, but the first novel certainly proved it could stand on its own. This is an enjoyable game that can be even more enjoyable if the players are familiar with the novel and make an effort to have their factions act "in-character." Choose your favorite film adaptation and try it out (say what you want about the first Dune film, and we'll probably agree with you on most points, but we still love the cast and the "look" of David Lynch's epic production).

RATING: 9
Excellent game. I only play with 2 player alliances, and these players need to hold four strongholds to win. This may increased to five, because the real fun of the game is solo victories.

The different powers means the game will play very differently depending on who you are. The game definitely plays best with 6 players, and plays poorly below 5.

It really needs 6 dedicated players to invest the energy and dedication to making it a GOOD, TENSE game with a lot of decisions.

Nagyon jó! Az egyik legjobb, és legkreatívabban megalkotott játék az általam ismertek közül. Nagyon egyedi mechanizmusokkal van tele (csata, vihar, kártyákkal kínálkozó lehetőségek és frakcióképességek nagy része ilyen). Bonyolultságát a játékosok eltérő lehetőségei adják. A játék hosszában nagyon nagy ingadozás lehet, 8 órás partiról is hallottam már, de az egyik, amit játszottam, 2 óra se volt! Állítólag 6-an a legjobb, de nekem 5 fővel is nagyon jó volt. A szerencse komoly szerephez juthat, de eléggé ki van egyensúlyozva ezzel együtt is a játék. Nekem elsőre a Harkonnen jutott, a jövőben is szeretnék ezzel a frakcióval lenni, bejött...

Harkonnent 3 parti alapján túl erősnek érzem!
---
5 év elteltével újra előkerült... Nos 6 fővel nagy meglepetésemre nem volt olyan ütős, lehet hogy csak rosszul alakult a játék (pl. 5. körig nem volt szövetségkötés). A császárt túl erősnek éreztük, nála és a Ligánál volt a teljes fűszerkészlet 80 százaléka...
Nevetséges, hogy a szabályban tök fajsúlyos részt képez a karama kártyák leírása, nagyon erős lapok, jól színesítenék a játékot... feltéve ha nem 2 ilyen lap lenne összesen.

RATING: 9
A game years ahead of its time.  Still one of the best SF multi-player games around.  The sweet spot is 5 players (although 4 is also OK).

With 6 the BG player tends to sit around most of the game with very little to do; with 2 or 3 it is seriously unbalanced.

Every game is a different experience, especially since each faction has its own special powers and therefore individual strengths and weaknesses.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Played twice, both times as a 6-player basic game using the optional rules: XV, XVI, XVII & XIX.  We played without using any expansions.

The strength and weakness of Dune is its alliance system.  Alliances may only be formed or broken when a Worm card (aka nexus) appears, which is randomly determined by the spice deck.  Ideally a nexus will appear every few turns so that the alliance system is dynamic and fluid.  However (much like the Westeros deck in A Game of Thrones) the deck shuffle can break the game.  Unfortunately, the spice deck distribution ruined both of my sessions.  
 
During my first session, a Worm did not appear until Turn 9, which is a really long time to wait!  The second time I played, a Worm appeared Turn 6, which would have been OK, but when a Worm does appear, you keep drawing until you draw a Territory card.  Unfortunately, the next 4 cards were Worms, leaving only 1 Worm card for the next 9 Turns (FYI- It finally appeared Turn 14.)  
    
So, does the alliance system in Dune make for a good game?  Well, in theory it sounds pretty cool.  Each faction has a variable set of player powers that they bring to the table.  These advantages can be combined together in some interesting ways.  However, the alliance system sort of sucks.  As stated, alliances are at the mercy of the spice deck, which can easily break the game. The other thing that sucks is that the game encourages alliances so much that you are almost forced into a counter-alliance if one or more factions join together.  I guess you can be sneaky and get a solo victory, but in most cases you have to share the win with one or more players, which SUCKS.      

I MIGHT play Dune again for I highly enjoy exploiting the variable player powers & traitors.  I also enjoy the secret selection of Leaders, Cards, & Troops during battle.  Perhaps with some house rules to fix the alliance system, I will be more inclined to play again... but why bother trying to fix Dune when I can simply play a better multi-player war game?

RATING: 5
This game begs for a facelift! Once you get over the quality of the materials you discover that gameplay is surprisingly deep, with alternative win conditions for many of the players, hidden agendas, traitors, etc. I have read and loved the Dune novel and feels the game captures the story well. I strongly dislike the alliance victory mechanic, although I realize that some of the factions have hidden agendas that can utilize alliances for individual victories. And yes you can ally against other factions but I will not play a 2-3 hour game were a two player alliance can win merely by capturing one more base beyond what they start with. Rating dropped accordingly.

Noticed in my second play through that recovering from an early battle loss is almost impossible.  Without spice to afford Treachery cards your leaders will die in combat and feed additional spice to others.  

This is compounded with the Fremen who do not have access to alternative means of getting spice.  Once I lost an inital battle, all future spice blows were contested and without threachery cards I faced a losing battle till the end.

Although I have to acknowledge it’s a good game, I really can’t seem to enjoy Dune: actually it isn’t anything else than a purely mathematical game where you only have to calculate your odds again and again before (and after) taking any action.

There’s no room for simply guessing, taking unnecessary risks or resorting to any level of randomness, which in my opinion results in too much of a brain stress for a pastime, that is for a hobby where you should simply have a light, thoughtless fun: heck, there’s not even a die roll in the entire game!

Moreover, its theme (Herbert’s saga and setting) has always left me aloof.

Dune is a clear case of nostalgia and sentiment trumping critical appraisal.  I would even argue that Dune fails to achieve the accurate and thick theme many apprise in it.  After all, when did the various factions ever come engage in full-scale war as depicted in this game?

Speaking of war, this is where the game truly crumbles as it fails to capture any strategic dynamic or tactical finesse.  Since only the strongholds matter and perhaps a couple spaces on the board with spice, most of the board rarely comes into play.  No exciting maneuvers, no logistical consequences and no tactical considerations.  Just ship into a (cheaper) stronghold and send a few guys to collect some nearby spice.  This wouldn't be a completely terrible model if not for the suicidal combat resolution.  All your guys die if you are vanquished.  If you win, even with one guy left, you control the stronghold and you keep your treachery cards, along with a hefty bonus of spice for killed leaders.  So most battles you dial one less than your maximum force pool, except that most leaders contribute about as much to victory so actual force count is irrelevant, then again a completely random weapon and armor system makes leaders very fragile.  Synthesizing all these elements, you have a system with such a huge discrepancy between winner and loser that it encourages Pyrrhic victories and wild swings of fate endlessly repeated as players reinforce directly into strongholds.

On top of this is a ludicrous economic model that fails to function in either the basic game or the advanced game and is subject to very strange perturbations based on which powers are in play.

Finally, we come to the novel alliance system, which unfortunately loses much of its appeal with the shallow nature of the rest of the game.  Alliances function mostly to leverage certain power combinations (like Atreides looking at treachery cards and the Imperium buying them for free) and meet the victory conditions rather than registering any strategic impact.  Unsatisfying to say the least.

Yet, for all of this it does maintain some charm imparted to it by the rich setting of Herbert's creation.  Even that, however, can't save a game that runs too long and rarely offers up any interesting decisions.

6 player Dune is the ultimate gaming experience!  Reflects the Dune universe beautifully, but will be lengthy with experienced players.  My favorite game of all time.

I saw a description of the David Lynch's "Dune" movie entitled, "Still crazy after all these years." This encapsulates the experience of the board game perfectly as well. It can run very long. There are rules questions that pop up that veteran Dune groups have answered differently in good faith. Each group has to decide which set of rules with which to play. There is a definite learning curve. It's out of print. ...and it's awesome. I owe my thanks to Slev for the rules rewrite, Ilya for the graphic redesign and Tullsen for the production; I have and can play this classic now. 

The theme is rich (I've played Rex and this matters more than I had thought). The asymmetry reveals itself in the blend of alliances, producing moments of just dazzling surprise in each session. The battles, particularly because of the traitor element, frequently involve the players holding their breath for the outcome to be revealed. My main group doesn't really have the patience for this but the game is worth finding a group that does. If I had one BGG wish to be granted, I'd wish for the Herbert Estate to grant Fantasy Flight the rights to produce the game with Iya's redesign. I won't hold my breath, but I will relish my opportunity to play this title. Get it on Ebay. Print and play it. Just play it.

A great game that has not lost its charm with the years. The players struggle to control a set number of strongholds on the planet while harvesting "spice" which provides income necessary to keep one's forces strong. The key elements from Herbert's classic books are skilfully woven together to form perhaps the best matching of theme to game ever seen. The "battle wheel" approach to combat is unique and fiendishly clever.

This game is best played with at least five or six, as strange things can happen with fewer, and choosing which factions to leave out is not a simple matter. More players also bring out the interesting alliance possibilities that can have drastic effects on the game's duration and outcome. Games will last anywhere from three turns to fifteen depending on the group dynamics (I highly recommend using the "almost official" rules regarding the number of strongholds needed for alliance victories). The designers from Eon who did this and "Cosmic Encounter" set the scene for what we call Euros today.

Our game started with a Harkonnen blitz that succeeded only in filling the Tleilaxu tank with black chits.  There was lots of shipping, so the Guild and Bene Genesserit had suprising military power.  Game played more quickly than expected, and I'd like to try it again soon.

Oh, what a blast that game was.  Let me make it clear that I find no boardgame experience to be more fulfilling than successfully defeating 5 other players in a battle of wits, diplomacy, and war.  Thus, you will find that my top 3 games require these skills in spades.  However, no other game can provide one with the feeling of ultimate devious pleasure than winning a game of Dune as the Bene Gesserit through their prescience ability!

I was fortunate in my first and only game to be randomly assigned the faction I was looking most forward to playing (Bene Gesserit).  I successfully foretold that the Fremen would win in Turn 7.  Well, it was more than luck as I worked subtly so that they would succeed (e.g. weakening a city here or there to make it open for the Fremen to take).  It required me to push against the Fremen too (for on Turn 6 they might have won had I not attacked them).  

Unfortunately, I had it in the bag until one person (Mr. Bourn the Harkonnen, of course) recalled, after the game was decided, that the final combat between Fremen and Corrino's was a tie and not a win for the Fremen (that would have given me the game due to my prescience).  Thus the Fremen did not capture the last city on T7 as I had predicted.  Bahh, a mere technicality I say!

Dune, along with Republic of Rome, are the games I want to play if there are six of us. There is ample opportunity for diplomacy, backstabbing and clever moves, powers are truly asymmetrical and players must always be alert or someone will sneak out a win. The mechanisms also capture many of the things I love about the book. Maybe a tad long, but a great game nevertheless.

My Dad bought this game decades ago, and I discovered it in a closet in my parents' home. A friend told me about its legendary status, so we eagerly gave it a go!

But no one liked it. I am very sorry.

Extent of My Investment - low (probably eight plays, a few decades ago)

Integration of Theme - some (conveys a sense of Herbert's created world)

Thoughts - noteworthy in its day as a rare multi-player, assymetrical title

Avalon Hill "Sting"

I often heard how well Dune implements its mechanics into the theme. Well that really is true.
For me, as a fan of Dune (books, movies and games), this game transports the story and the feeling of the Dune-universe incredibly well.
Every faction feels like it is represented in the movies.

What I really like, besides the well balanced, asymmetric factions, is the alliance-mechanism. Most games don't feature true alliances. But here it offers more than empty promises and eventually backstabbing, no, here it gives you benefits if you work together.
Absolutely great game and another proof that old games have a lot to offer.

An effective adaptation of the book. Don't need to know the book to play but it helps. I really like this one. Pretty close to modern family game design efficiency; not too long or complex, good flavour of its 'world', nicely balanced. Clever 'pick' system: Guessing your enemies 'committement' of troops and leader choice, in battles. This balances luck nicely

RATING: 9
I used to play this a *lot* 15 years ago, and then might have rated it a 9 or 10. It's fallen off a lot recently, though, with a lot of the longer games that no longer seem such good bang for the time investment anymore. Dune really is much too long for today, and I am unlikely to play again despite the wonderful ambiance, amongst the best game adaptations of a book/movie ... by a wide margin. I'll break with the conventional wisdom, I think 5 is best ... unless you can find someone who explicitly *wants* to play the Bene Gesserit. They can be quite powerful, but they also can be really, really boring as they take forever to build up strength and have a horrible time getting money. The Guild may have sucky leaders, but at least they're usually flush. Anyway, as interesting as the BG can be, I wouldn't want to inflict them on anyone who wasn't enthused about playing them. The Tleilaxu expansion for the General is facinating, an interesting alternate 6th (or even 7th) power, and hardly *less* involved than the BG. For a good bloodbath to help out the Tleilaxu, play with The Duel. Decidedly *not* a fan of the Landsraad as their "hoser" power seems to be against the spirit of the game.

RATING: 7
Based on 1 play: Just played this for the first time, and thought it was great (I won, as Emperor!). Since four people were learning though, we didn't use the alliance rules. I look forward to playing again using them. This game is remarkably well-themed. It evokes the feel of the books near-perfectly. All the powers are incredibly well-balanced; in fact, I think its only fault is that I really wouldn't want to play without max players... if any one of the powers were missing, I think things would feel a bit off.

Update: played again 6 years later in a comical game where my boyfriend won on TURN ONE. So, didn't get much time to re-assess my feelings on the game, but a few things jumped out at me:

-Coming to this game some 20+ years after its release is sort of harsh, just in that the presentation is so poor. There's a LOT to take in for each race, and it's sort of spread out between your individual character sheet, generic reference sheet, and the rulebook. A component update would make this game 100x more learnable. It's a shame it will probably never be re-released.

-Remembered a couple of things that feel like they could be streamlined. Notably, the whole half-point system for committing units feels just plain convoluted.

There's probably a few other rough edges that could be worked out, but I didn't get the chance to experience them! I remember my first game took somewhere in the neighborhood of 2 hours, which I felt was unnecessarily long (making game 2 all the funnier, I guess). Hopefully I can get a better feel for the game by playing again... sometime before 6 years from now.

RATING: 9
The classic assymetrical game and one of the cleverest translations of theme from book to game. The different faction abilities and possibility of traitors are true to the book and make for a tense game where you take on a role rather than a colour. Should be played with the additional character advantages (not to be mistaken for the advanced rules which are more hassle than they're worth). Game length seems to be highly variable. The mechanics were groundbreaking when it first came out but might feel rather 'clunky' to modern eurogamers. The auctions can slow the game down if not everyone is paying attention. I would like to try having the player whose turn it is start the bidding and then open it up after that.

This game really deserves to be reprinted with updated components (better cards, shields and tokens, bigger board and more concise rules). Some lovely resources available in the files section to improve the look of the game thanks to several creative geeks. The Herbert estate's refusal to re-licence this game is odd from an accountant's viewpoint and a huge disappointment for fans of the book and game.

Previously owned two copies of the AH edition and the Descartes French edition. Now own a P&P version cobbled together from the best bits of five different editions / re-designs! Includes stickered wooden tokens and three decks of ArtsCow cards.

RATING: 6
*6* ( Initial Plays)
I am not familiar with theme having not read any of the books.  After my initial plays of the game I liked it. There is quite a bit of information to take in initially, especially with all the different characters, and there is a good amount of interacting among players. The game length hinders getting this to the table as often, it's unclear how long a game could last.

Yes, I own a copy of this--bought the AH version around 1985 or so.  No, you can't have it. Nyah, nyah.

Our group pulled this out in Oct. 2006 after not having played it for 5+ years.   "What a great game!  Why hadn't we played it for so long?" we all asked.

We play with the optional rules, but not the advanced rules.  We also play without alliances.

The expansions aren't that great, IMO.  Spice Harvest is interesting but probably not worth the time it adds to the game.

Best boardgame ever made. Some people ruin it by playing without bribes or negotiation, which are the heart of the game.  Nothing better than a 12 hour, six player, hard fought game of Dune, with the expansions.

Includes  Dune Variant Cards (1986).  Note the backs of these cards are the color that matches the old "Worm" cover Dune cards, not the newer "Sting" cover Dune cards, so they will stick out if you try to use them with a "Sting" Dune set.

RATING: 4
Rated 4 after one play. This is a tough game to rate, as there's a lot to really appreciate with this game. For a game released in 1979, there's a surprising range of fun and innovative mechanics. The auction for "treachery cards" is actually pretty solid, and possibly the best aspect of the game is the unique roles of each player. 

We played with the full complement of six, and it was fun to watch the interactions between roles that encourage combat, boost money, provide hidden information, etc. These roles aren't minor tweaks; they are serious power differences that enrich the gameplay.

The Achilles heel is the play time and the slow move to an endgame. In three hours, we had two or three moments when either a player or an alliance between two players came close to ending it, only to watch the rest of the players rebalance and kick 'em out of position. It's a slow crawl to finish the game, and given the lengthy playtime, I'd rather be playing some modern options that have a better game arc. Still, anyone curiously interested in some of the "grandfathers" of modern gaming need to play this at least once.

This is the game that got me back into gaming after a 10 year hiatus. Excellent game.  The theme is immersive.  The rules mimic Herbert's world.  There are asymmetrical powers that must play different strategies to win.  You can form and break alliances.  There are traitors.  MMM...goodness.

Only played once so I don't have a grasp on the strategies. But similar to Cosmic Encounter it has different starting abilities for each side and also similarily requires negotiations. Both of the elements I love. The theme also adds to the game greatly. It played much quicker than I thought it would based on the size of the rules. I think it was just over an hour. I am sure my rating should be higher but it took too long to get through the rules. However the next game should be much better now that I know how to play.

This is my favorite game. The Bene Gesserit rules really make for some interesting play. They predict who will win and when and write this down before the game begins. If they successfully predict the outcome, they win. So imagine an alliance round, do you ally with the Bene Gesserit-- they might be trying to really help you, or they could throw the fight so the other side could win, making them win. Everything they say has multiple meanings...

Works best with six players but is still okay with five. Four of less - forget it.

We use to play with the Duel extension double spice-blow and all optional rules because we feel it reequilibrate the game in favor of the poorest: Fremen and Bene Geserit.

As for Spice Harvest we don't play with it: It's a game in itself before the standard game and it changes completely the situation on Arrakis.

Probably this is THE negotiation game I'm looking for. The premise of negotiation game is you need to have possibility to need help or helping other players, and so mechanically your move should be affected a lot by other player actions. It's pretty easy to fall on each end (Full diplomacy like Cosmic Encounter or, well, Diplomacy, or maybe full mechanical like Chicago Express or Container). But Dune strikes the perfect balance of mechanic and diplomacy. 

Not to mention the special abilities of each faction is clearly bringing out the Dune theme a lot. Theme is dripping! The only downside is it's truly at its best at 6 player. Less is probably playable, but I don't know.

If this game were ever to be republished, I'm convinced the overall impression would be "OK, that's cool, but it's not THAT cool."It is a system that can lead players to fritter away four to six hours, only to watch as two players - in desperation for the damn thing to end - form an unholy alliance that completely unbalances the forces at odds, and pulls the entire rug out of under everyone.  Clever ideas?  Yes, some, but certainly not the end-all or be-all for implementation thereof.

The ultimate irony for it, perhaps, is that it is a standard bearer for the Ameri-Trash crowd, yet by far best typifies some of the nature of Euro-games, well before they were pigeonholed as such - no dice for combat, hidden bidding, resource-collection, etc.

RATING: 9
An excellent experience that only suffers point degradation as it effectively requires 6 players, which makes the ability to play it slightly more limited than other games.  A rather surreal experience, that probably deserves an 11. Lies, deception, backstabbing... What more could you want?

RATING: 7
After a single playing to learn the game (which I screwed up massively by losing all my units on turn 1 as Harkonnen), I can see a lot of promise here. Other players in our group complained about the rules, and the fact that they are all breakable by cards or special powers, but that's exactly what I like about Dune. It's the same appeal as Cosmic Encounter (Olotka, Kittredge and Eberle's other biggie). Can't wait to get into the strategies of the different factions, but we might struggle to get six players again :(

RATING: N/A
An old classic. Probably the best use of a theme ever in a board game. A combination of various gameplay styles and mechanics blended together to make something that does the Dune universe justice. The major downsides are the long playing time, the crap quality of the playing cards, and the unbalanced nature of the (small amount of) races included. Rating it low to get petty revenge on the Herbert estate for not letting FFG use the licence.

The dune license definately adds a lot to this game, not sure how interesting it would be without.

Ending the game can be anticlimatic multiplayer alliances, otherwise use house rules to limit alliances, but it ends up feeling clunky and forced, and alienates players who took a pounding early.

Really not keen on games that rely on heavy use of open ended negotiation.

I so wanted to like this game, but it's such a garbled hodge-podge of stuff.  We had constant disputes over interpreting the rules (and had to muddle through the original French for adjudication) and incessant queries of "what happens now?" or "what does this do?"  I'd far far prefer just playing Diplomacy.

Great multi-player mayhem where you always have a shot at winning.  Surprisingly fun, the game also really captures the flavor of the book and all of the different factions.

RATING: 7
A must-play for any hardcore Dune fan like myself and probably not the best choice for someone who isn't familiar with the story as the interplay and special rules are a bit more intuitive if you already understand the factions (unlike say Game of Thrones where not having read the books will not prevent you from understanding or enjoying the game)

The game was long, it was intense, at times even frustrating.  I preferred it once the alliances came into play, which in hour game wasn't for several hours.  There really is some opportunity for brilliant maneuvers here, the kind that get you so excited when you manage to pull off.

This is a game I probably wouldn't play more than once a year because of the length and intensity, but I would be unhappy to go more than a year or two without playing it.

A lot of the older games are propped up with nostalgia: they really don't hold up that well against newer offerings.  AH games, I've found, often find themselves in this category.  Dune does not.  Dune is something special.  It marries a perfectly implemented and rich theme, with excellent mechanics.  Yes the rules can be fiddly, but they are so for a purpose.  If you're a fan of the books, you will feel very comfortable in a game of Dune.  Even if you're not familiar, you'll find Dune is probably the best multiplayer wargame ever made.  It will be tough sledding to learn the differences between the factions, but you'll have plenty of help because there is some cooperation in this game.  Your strategic, tactical, and diplomatic skills will be pushed to their limits.  The movement in Dune is so spare as to evoke Chess or Go.  Feints and strikes abound.  That said, you'll be amazed at how epic Dune feels despite a maximum of 30 moves.

Decent game based on the book. The game is dripping with theme, as each side has its own special abilities, which is neat, and the mechanics are basically sound. The downside is that the playing time can drag if no one can get a clear advantage.

The components are generally old and cruddy. It's a shame there are legal issues preventing a second edition.

This currently sits as my all-time favorite game. Update:  It used to be my favorite.  War of the Ring has eclipsed it.  Dune is still my 2nd favorite game though.  Dune has the perfect combination of depth, skill, story line, luck, diplomacy, and complexity...very well playtested. It does seem like all the stars have to be in perfect alignment to play the game though. You really need 6 (5 works ok) players with 5  hours to explain the game, and then finish it. An appreciation of the story line makes the game even that much better. The Sci-Fi version of Dune from the Sci-Fi channel (not the crappy 80s Sting version) should be required viewing before playing the game. :)

RATING: 9
[Eon] One of the real great games out there. Beats out so many other negotiation games in that deals and alliances are managed in the rules and changeable only at certain phases every few turns. The sparse board positions and ability to transfer pieces to board from your stock prevents it from devolving into a wargame. Dune was eons ahead of its time for sure, and still beats out all of the other negotiation and empire games I can think of. Easily worth the time investment for such memorable experiences.

(my copy is a print-n-play mounted version constructed from internet downloads)

When playing with 2, be very careful about what factions you use, or else be ready to modify the victory conditions.   Since this game isn't really about balance, it can end REAL fast with two players, but really it's best with 4-6 players anyway and shouldn't be played with just 2.

This is perhaps the pinnacle of the marriage of theme and mechanics.  People who have never read the books or even seen the movie(s) will likely have a hard time caring about this game.   However the design is richly thematic and it's amazing how far ahead of its time all the EON games are. This game has a tendancy to end very quickly, or go the full distance, and not much inbetween.

Based on one play:

I found this game to be the 'heaviest' game I've played yet. It was fun and very challenging. I would definitely play it again...but I don't know when or how often I'm going to have to set aside 4-6 hours to play a single game, and I think I would rather play two games of Cosmic Encounter or get two games in over one game most of the time. But I enjoy the movies, liked the book, like the story...If I have the time, I'll play again.

I enjoyed the battle mechanics, the storm seemingly always barreling down on you and all the things that go into each move that make this a deep strategic game.

Update: it's now my grail game. Rarely do you see a game where variable player powers and basic game mechanics are as interwoven as in Dune, and wow does Dune pull it off. Great war/negotiating game. Played the Dune setup expansion once and felt like it was a good time by itself, but not really needed for the base Dune game. As a matter of fact a recent game which I cant think of came out and was basically that expansion alone. SUSD did a 3-game review which included the game.

Want to play more. Again it gets out competed by A Game of Thrones, because my game group flock to the familiar (they've seen the show, read the books etc). Appears to be awesome sauce though. I love Dune, the books, and even the David Linch Film. This game is almost unmatched in its ability to capture that theme. It can be abit chaotic, one side can win on the first turn if the others aren't paying attention. This happened in my first and only play of the new Rex version.

I own the french version from Descartes Editeur.

Dune is one of my favorite games. It is another classic board game for me. I always look forward to playing Dune again. I really want to play it again sometime.

The game really shines with 6 players. Playable with 4-5 players but no less if you want a worthwhile game experience. It is better with 6 players since all families are represented.

I would want to play this game with my regular gamers at home, though it can be a long game. 

In 2008 at the WBC, I watched part of the final and it took nearly 9 hours. Reason why it doesn't hit the table today. The more players you have the longer it can take.

UPDATE: I played two games of Dune recently with four players and it was more fun than I first of thought it would be since not all the families are represented. The two games played were played in the same day too. A four player game is a lot shorter than a six player game.

Alliances can be short or long depending how often the worms comes out and if you want to stay in the same alliances or switch to someone else or go out on your own again.

Can't wait to play Dune again.

Made my own copy. For a game that's 30 years old, it has aged very well. Very strong theme, high player interaction, every side is nicely balanced etc. A classic multiplayer conflict game that actually works. I have mixed feelings about alliances though. Having the rule keeps game length manageable but can tilt the game towards the Bene Gesserit. In any case, in games with less than six players, I'm inclined to leave out BG because their game play is too passive for anyone to have fun with. But that may encourage alliances between two very strong military powers (i.e. Atreides and Harkonnen) and they just sweep the board. Handling the BG issue is tricky...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
[5 plays] This is the rare game based on a book that succeeds both in capturing the flavor of the book and in being as good in its own (game) way as a great book.  Read the book first or the game will make no sense whatever. Dune is a magnificent epic game, the kind that generates moments that you remember and talk about long afterward.  Some see its highly variable and potentially long playing time as a big drawback; it can easily go 8 hours, but a victory in the early rounds may wrap it up within a couple of hours.  Of course the long time causes some scheduling issues, but the game is well worth it, and I don't see it as negative in itself; Dune may last for 8 hours, but they'll be 8 really fun and exciting hours.

[b][thread=512219]The PLAYMOBIL® Legion reviews "Dune"[/thread][/b]

(As of [b]4[/b] plays) After you come to terms with the wildly different special abilities of each faction, actual gameplay is pretty simple. The theme is beautifully wedded to the mechanics. Negotiation, alliances and betrayals add a wonderful layer of interpersonal complexity on top. Only downside is the potential for ludicrously, frequently prohibitively long playing times and, consequently, incomplete games.

[b]2 year verdict:[/b] I really dislike the long playing time, but I wouldn't mind playing again, if the stars and my mood aligned. A truly great negotiation game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Enjoyable, but feels a tad overrated to me.  I do enjoy games with alliances, but they tend to need experienced, or at least cutthroat, players to really shine.  My one play was certainly affected by some negative factors, and I will have to revisit this rating.

Only one of the six had read the book, and it took quite some time to get this creaky antique off the ground (those rules!).  I had the same critique as many others in that most of the board wasn't used in the game.  There seems to be a common 'push-pull' flow in Eon games, where high attrition in combat and fixed victory locations cause forces to go back and forth, repeating moves and fighting battles over and over.  The actual combat is nicely odd, but a bit of a frustratingly obtuse guessing game.

The asymmetrical powers and negotiations and alliances are well done and certainly appear to give the game longevity.

I’m fortunate to have a group who plays this somewhat regularly (few times a year) and now that we all know the game well enough, the sessions are epic. I’ve had epic victories and epic wipeouts. I’ve been insignificant only to hook up with the winning player at the right time. I’ve been betrayed by my own partner (Bene Gesserit wanted to preserve his prediction so he threw one of our battles!). I’ve been riding high only to lose most of my forces and get kicked to the curb by my partner who goes on to win with someone else. And they’re all epically fun sessions.

This game delivers on what so many others wish they could – a sandbox where players rise and fall in power and alliances constantly shift yet nobody is ever truly out of it. Try getting wiped out in Civ and climbing back in; not likely. The different faction powers and cards mean that a new plan is not too far out of reach.

The space for creative play is wonderfully open. We play with optional faction and Karama powers and you can make some crazy things happen like stealing cards out of a players hand or negating somebody’s special power at the worst time. The asymmetrical faction powers work in a way that makes them feel roughly balanced. Some factions are on WBC record as having won more but they’re all close enough.

I especially like how the alliances work. There’s no fear of Diplomacy or Game of Thrones style out-of-the-blue backstabbing here. You can only ally/un-ally during certain points in the game. I’m so tired of traitor and lying games, and I appreciate the opportunity here to focus on creative power moves vs treachery to a partner. I’m very happy my group has decided instead of trying other games similar to this one to simply play more Dune.

An obvious classic, one of the most thematic games I have played without a doubt and a great recreation of the book.

The battles are bloody and the opportunism rampant.  This wouldn't be so much of a problem if there weren't the constantly shifting alliances which can alter the whole game balance in a turn and create an easy win for the opportunists.  

So, although alliances lie at the heart of this game, they can imbalance the game to make it too lopsided, which is why this keeps my rating at 7.5.

Not played it yet. It's my own construction. In fact at time of writing I haven't made the storm marker yet - it's the final cherry on the cake.
Update - played the game twice. Totally love it! I can totally see why people get hooked on this classic, the depth is astonishing. The great thing about the special powers is that though some are your standard - you get a benefit that he others don't - affair, many are much more fluid than that and there are a few different reasons why you might use them - the more you reflect on an ability, the more ideas pop into your head. I'm particularly fascinated by the Benegesserits. They are tricky to use and I find them a cool challenge. I really think this game is the gift that could keep giving for decades even with regular play.

First play with 6 was fun, need to play it again.  It has a really wide open feel.  It's simpler than I thought and the negotiation parts are lively.  It moved well for a six player game.  I love the old AH retro '80 look of the artwork and cards!  Takes me way back....

RATING: 7
a.k.a. "As the Worm Turns" due to the game-altering Alliances enabled by the appearance of the sandworm, Shai-Hulud. Dune is the precursor of the modern Euro-wargame, playing to conclusion in 2-3 hours due to Alliances. Thoroughly entertaining, with the various powers of the factions causing all sorts of havoc (especially with Alliances in force). Never play with less than six, and never sub in the three expansion factions (they ruin the fine balance of the game). The Duel and Spice Harvest expansions are *not* recommended. Otherwise, this is a great game that remains very effective 25 years after it was first published. If you're a fan of the Herbert novels, that only increases the appeal (the flavor of the game setting and mechanics is off the scale).

Luck infested game: blind auction (and I mean, you don't know what you _buy_!), rock-paper-scissor combat mechanism. Arrgh. Ok, special powers can mitigate this luck somehow but it's still way too random for the sheer length of the game. Interesting from an historical point of view since the game is some kind of milestone in the genre. I can see why some people like it: the theme is great and somehow fits. It really didn't grab me though.

One of the best boardgames.  Wore out one copy and had to buy another.  The basic game is best with the optional rules added in.  The advanced game is unbalanced and doesn&#039;t really add anything good.  The two expansion sets are interesting but again don&#039;t add anything except upset the play balance.  The games only fault is the tear down the leader aspect each turn.

I need to play a "real" game.  In our game no worms came up for 10 rounds and we had to quit early, so we never had any alliances.  The theme was enough to make it fun even though I knew nothing about the Dune universe.  I didn't feel like I was making very significant decisions, though.

It is incredible that a design that is as old as I am is still valid. It feels like a modern board game. The designers were way ahead of their time and that's probably why the target audience did not understand this masterpiece when it came out. I is a shame that the Herbert Estate don't let this game be reprinted. The theme of Dune is perfect for the mechanisms (It was designed around the theme, no doubt).

Could this game be played with less than 6 players I would have rated it a 10. But needing this high player count makes it difficult to play on a regular basis.

I have literally only played this 1st printing 1979 Dune game a couple times solo and I've had it since it was first released. No wonder this game has a huge cult following. There are other reasons for the Sting version being so famous but I'll leave that to the ether! The game is quite fun because of the abilities of the characters. There's an amazing amount of things each player can do every turn, and a whole lot of bluffing. I've never cared much for bidding games, but the bidding in this for Treachery cards is pretty unique and fun. If you've never played Dune, you really should. I plan to see if I can loop a friend into playing it for real (rather than solo), so we can see how it really shines.

RATING: 9
For a game which is now pushing 30 (it still has a few years), and a title I didn't have the pleasure of playing till well after a multitude of newer designs, I am amazed how this game holds up.  Although games of Dune are hard to organize, as it does require the full compliment of six, when the stars are aligned this is quite simply the most fun I have had playing a game - and might possibly be the closest to being a perfect gaming experience. The theme is rich, the variable powers are designed immaculately, the asymmetry is beautiful especially when alliances are formed and played with treachery.  One can not help but love parading into a Harkonnen strong hold with one Fremen, a lazegun, and a projectile shield.  Dune is a game that leaves you with stories - the kind you never tire of telling or hearing.

UPDATE:  Dune is now more than three decades old, and still going strong.  Only drawback is it needs 6 players to really work and possibly a good chunk of time.

 After a play just a bit ago I have revised my rating for this game upward. I had forgotten just how much fun this game can be. Great with 6 players!

This game of cut throat diplomacy fits the book's theme perfectly.  What makes Dune so successful is the seamless blending of Cosmic Encounter's variable player powers and victory conditions, Diplomacy's hard nosed negotiations (and treachery), and an elegance way ahead of its time.  In my heart this is a 9+, but the fact that it takes so long to play knocks it down to an eight.

We have a reprint of this game, and it is one of my favorites & there's never a shortage of players in our group.  It's a great example of a game with amazing mechanics (there's a lot going on without it being unwieldy), but where the theme dominates (rather than being a secondary add-on to the game).  I like the fact that negotiation is built-in and that any openly-proclaimed alliance must be kept, at least until the next negotiation phase comes up.  This game has LOTS of backstabbing - which is absolutely true to the spirit of Dune!

I think I need to play this again. The worm card didn't come out until round 8 making for a very strange game. I really disliked the end game as well. I think the alliance system is a bit broken and needs to be modified to ensure alliances can be entered into earlier than round 8. There also needs to be some limitation on the number of people in an alliance. It has potential but right now it is a 5.

[b]Dune[/b] [i]Bill Eberle - Peter Olotka 1979[/i] 
One of the best multiplayer experiences in the market. Perfect game for six players, the bad news are that it is only perfect exactly with this number. Antoher issue is its playing time since it is very variable, from forty five minutes to several hours. Otherwise the game is just wonderful: nice combat mechanics, room for a lot of negotiation and screwage between players, secret pacts, traitors, as well as six different races with their own powers and combos, that must be played in a very diferent way each other to win the game. Just a wonderful design that was created back in 1979!!!

Oct 8, 2007 - First Play ever.  I fear that Dune's rating may be inflated by nostalgia from old fans (which I freely admit to inflating some of my nostalgic ratings of my own!).  It was an interesting 'wargame' with asymmetrical sides.  But it's ability to wipe out players with one card or sandstorm, and the crippled alliance rules hurt the game. I'm interested to see how the 'reprint' if it ever arrives rates.  6/10

It has a theme, which unusully well incorporated into the game. The rules are also pretty simple, but all these different powers, not to forget optional/advanced rules, makes it a bit messy and lowers the rating.

Multiple interesting mechanisms, auctions, variable player powers, -- the Eon folks were brilliant.

I want to like this more than I do. I enjoyed it a time or two twenty years ago but I didn't like it much the one time I played recently. It doesn't feel right that the game can end with an alliance victory within the first hour of play.

Bought because of my love for the book and played a lot when I was a teenager but not since. I was surprised to see how highly rated it is here but I do remember it being great fun, although I'm not sure we ever managed it with a full group of six players. I still have it somewhere minus the box but otherwise hopefully complete and will have to dig it out.

Edit October 2011: Replayed in the past 6 months and as good as I remembered.....although it can't be played without modification to limit the number of alliance members (as we quickly found out).

There are many problems with Dune: it requires exactly six players, it's duration can vary from 1 to 5 hours, it's very rules-heavy. But none of that matters because it captures the spirit of its source material so well. The mechanisms are pretty abstract, but overall, you feel like your struggling for control of the most important planet in the universe.

I don't get many opportunities to play Dune, but I cherish every time I do.

Great take on the book series with possible Fremen vs. Atreides battles. An alternate history in an easy to learn but hard to master boardgame. I love a game based on any fictional work that does not slavishly adhere to the plotline attempting to recreate every event in the book. Another game where all the players must understand the nuances created by the special abilities of each faction. Hard to get a game going except at a convention. A classic.

It may have been good for the time it was published, but it has not aged well. Long, boring and incredibly random for a game without dice!

First, you have a series of pointless card auctions where you don't know what you are buying (OK, the Atreides player can see the cards, but it would save a lot of time to allow players just to buy cards at a fixed price and let the Atreides draw two and keep one, for example).

Then, most of the cards are used in combat to kill or defend leaders in a guessing way, with some blind bidding of troops occurring at the same time. The winner may have huge benefits and the loser is severely penalized. Just one or two losses may result in impossible recovery, making the player suffer through the rest of the game - and the playing time may vary immensely. Some cards can also cause huge swings of luck outside of combat, not to mention an absolutely ridiculous special power that allows the Bene Gesserit player to simply steal the victory by guessing the winner and the turn the game ends.

The fascinating universe of Frank Herbert's books and the rich implementation of the theme draw interest to the game, but do little to save it after the novelty goes off (after a few turns). And let's not even talk about production values.

Hard to rate. It surely provides a compelling play experience (even for those like myself with no affinity for Herbertisms--I routinely call the Kwisatz Haderach the Knick-Knack Paddywhack), but the rules are a bit wonky and the game is vastly too long. The movement on the board, in general, is dull and fiddly--especially since most of the action happens via transportation anyway.
All that said, it can produce moments verging on pure brilliance--the daring gambit, the unexpected leader death, the sublime joy at being opposed by a traitor. The first (and only) game I played had a Bene Gesserit win, which was like poetry in its beauty.
I don't think I'll play it again, though, which is a shame. Long past time this got streamlined, and, I for one don't agree that the thematic integration is 100% necessary. Ditch the storm, change the map, keep the combat and traitors... It seems doable.

I can see why this is a grail game.  Could possibly warrant a 10 after more plays.  A very dynamic wargame with plenty of negotiation, backstabbing, and variety.  Each player is a different experience with different powers.  Very well done.  Two complaints: The components suck, and it is a bit too dynamic.  You never know who's going to win.

Holy cow this is a great game.  Played one abbreviated game (we finished, though we ganged up on some people in an alliance to win early because it was dinner time) and despite the abbreviated play had to immediately consider whether or not that was the most fun I had ever had playing a board game.  

Dune captures the "we are unsure who is on our side" tension of battlestar galactica, combines it with an elegant combat mechanism reminiscent of fine area majority war-euro style game, a complex but simple economy of resources like you would expect to see in a great economic game, and has the alliances and backstabbing through a structured environment of Empires in Arms.  Notice I said EiA there and not diplomacy...  backstabbing for backstabbing's own purpose doesn't really work in Dune.

This is a fantastic game everyone should play if they get a chance.  The only problem with it is that the rules, although simple, are not well written at all.  This issue can be alleviated by reading up online, getting some of the clarifications downloaded, and using player aids.  It really is worth the effort.

Simple rules simulating a complex fictional setting. Dune does a good job recreating some of the themes of the novel and is pretty easy to learn while having some fairly deep strategy. Shai Hulud can wipe out spice production and the coriolis storms can wipe out your units. Interesting interactions can occur when your factions' special abilities work against another's. There's probably a few modern boardgame designers that drew inspiration from this game. If you love the Dune novels (I have for many years) you need to play this game a couple of times. If you like games that give a full strategy boardgame experience you should try it.

An exquisitely interesting, exciting and strategically deep game. I just love how each character is so different than the next but everything hangs together in dynamic, balanced, suspenseful and rhythmic gameplay. Since each player plays a force that has significantly different strengths and weaknesses, each person has a unique role in the game. This makes for a game that shifts and changes in quite a beautiful way, and that would seem to support almost boundless replayability. I really like how the game sets the conflict in a context of a natural disasters like a deadly approaching storm and dangerous sandworms. That really heightens the epic feel.

The person who taught me this game also shared this bit of wisdom: alliances should only be acts of desperation; playing in the spirit of the game means trying to be the sole winner and not settling for a win by alliance.

RATING: 2
Played two 6-player games, both with the Fremen, and was utterly unimpressed.

I had never seen a more unbalanced game, where some players are spectators more than anything else (especially the Freman).

This is a game where the stong will go out of their way to take out the weak, because the winner gets rewarded in spice (the game's currency) for taking out leaders, theirs included.  Unfortunately, that makes the weak a prime target, and they only get weaker, not to say taken out of the "game", if it can be called that.

By pure luck (4 worm signs out of 5 cards), and multiple alliance changes in a row, the Fremen are now somehow in a position to win a battle...  Unfortunately, they don't have any leaders.

In my two games, my impression was that I had no control whatsoever.  It is a diplomatic game more than anything else, but since the Fremen have nothing of value to offer, it is very difficult to enter into an alliance, let alone collect any spice which may help them get out of this predicament.  Does this sound like a solid "10" game?

To add insult to injury, the Atreides sells info to the B.G., letting that player know which cards you purchased...  

Based on my experiences, I am unable to see where's the enjoyment.  Surely these players don't play with the Fremen!  An utterly pointless game, yet I was wiling to give this one another try, as so many folks here appear to enjoy this game (for the life of me, I can't understand why).

Merits a 1, but the game oozes with theme, so it earns a 2 (most pointless 4 hour non-game I have ever seen).

A true classic in every sense of the word.

The design is dynamic, tense and filled with theme, to the point where every game seems so utterly different, but always memorable.  

It is a game where the players not only talk excitedly about the game mechanics, strategies and possibilities of play, but also about the events that happened, surprise upsets, victories and defeats.

It should be noted that the rules are not at all straight-forward, and choosing which rules to play with is a matter of experimenting.  

Also worth noting is that other players have posted lots of house rules that make a lot of sense : have a look at these and decide which to include.

The only negative point to this game is finding a copy : thanks to all those uploaders who spent so much time to allow the rest of us an opportunity to play this amazing game.

This is an excellent game because of the interaction and role playing.  It fits well with the theme, and is fairly attractive.  I own the French version, and even though my playgroup does not have french speakers, the game is quite playable.  In fact, I think it adds to the exotic/gothic feel of the game. 

Down side to the game, it is definitely not for everyone.  Some of my group are frankly put-off by any science fiction theme.  Also, the game is lengthy and promotes back-stabbing.  

The Descartes version included the Spice Trader, and Duel expansions.  I like the spice trader for starting the game with theme, but find the Duel to be a tedious addition.

Our first and only try at Dune was a disaster. I believe we had some of the rules completely wrong, and no one really understood the significance of the combat system, which seems to emphasize guerrilla tactics. There is a good game here, but the first play (we quit after an hour, with only one/two turns) left a bad taste in our mouths. I will have to find a new group of five or six to spring this on.

RATING: 6
Based on one play: Game ended on second turn. Seemed to play pretty decently with 6 (which is more than most games can say). Some potential but lots of questionable stuff that would require more plays to get a solid opinion on.

What happened in our play: on turn 2 a Nexus came out. Guild & Emperor aligned. Atreides, Harkonnen, and Fremen aligned. Bene Gessirit held the balance of power, threw in with Atreides et al. A couple of big battles and the 4-way alliance won at the end of the 2nd turn (with 0 spice harvested by anyone).

- The Bene Gessirit player can "predict" which player will win on which turn. That's a bit of an ask for players with little/no experience in the game. "Do most games go 5 turns or 10 turns?"

- Blind bidding (except for Atreides) on the treachery cards feels like it might be a bit too much randomness.

- Feels like there needs to be something to just prevent everyone from forming a 6-way alliance on the first Nexus and calling it Game Over. If winning in an alliance is okay, then why not a 6-way alliance? Why prefer a 2-way over a 6-way if you're going to share the victory?

Still, I'd be curious to play a few more times and see how else the game can develop. My provisional rating could go up.

Great theme that fits the actions very well - every faction plays very different (if very unbalanced), a lot of backstabbing and insane vicious battles, and a very harsh unforgiving environment.

The initial infatuation is definitely starting to wear off, but I can't help wanting to play it anyway.  The problems are that we have more than one run into a deadlock-type situation.  With no alliances and more than 3 players it's impossible to win (and even with 3, only if someone totally ignores your attempt at victory).  With alliances, again a stalemate was reached.  Holding out for more plays :)

Update: It is a very long game, with quite a few complex rules, so it requires a serious commitment before pulling out. Downgraded to 7.

Now out of print, I played a friend's version of the came hand-made from someone in Ukraine. It was beautiful, though I can't compliment the original on that aspect. What I can say is for a game of area control, the amount of assymetry in the player powers was staggering. Yet not debilitating. In fact, the spread seemed almost necessary, as their interdependence made the world run - just like in the books. An excellent adherence to theme, storms and worms must be avoids, just as the Holtzmann Effect with shields and lasers must be! Play as the Bene Gesserit and win by being the power behind the throne, the Fremen by keeping Dune Arrakis, or the Emperor by spreading your might across the land. Truly a pinnacle of combining theme and mechanics.

Dune seems like it was pretty ahead of its time.  I especially love the little mini-economy in the game.  If you want to buy influence, pay the Emperor player; if you want to ship units, pay the Guild player.  The special powers all mesh nicely while fitting the theme incredibly well and varying pretty drastically.  The addition of negotiating, bribery, and functional alliances are of course always a plus for me.  The only unfortunate downfalls to the game are the length and vague rules (I had to abort my first game due to a misreading that locked the progress and broke the ending conditions).  Still, if you want a negotiating game with special powers, varied ending conditions for the players, and a conquest type feel - this old dinosaur is probably a decent bet.  It really doesn't feel as dated as it should.

Ideal Players: 6

Description: Fight for control of Arrakis as one of the major characters in Frank Herbert's Dune.

Pro: Perfectly captures the feel of Frank Herbert's Dune. Each game tells an epic story. Deterministic combat with a blind-bidding system. Players each have different abilities and special victory conditions, leading to a dynamic game board and a different game every time.

Con: Requires 6 players for a good game. Expansions make the game too complex.

Afert a long time waiting to play this game, I finally played it on 2010.It was a long game, the full 15 turns. It was also an experience, we had fun playing it, nevertheless it has defects common among 80's designs, like long playing time and king-making.

One of the most balanced space warfare, political, trade and treachery games ever produced.  Faithfully reproduces the feel of "wheels within wheels" which signify the Herbert books.  Well worth the purchase price to acquire one of these if you have 4 or more players willing to give it a go.

I fell in love with the assymetric powers of the races, the evolving alliances and the general gameplay.

Apparently, the original rules were someplace between unstable and and unplayable but the adopted homerules with double spice flow make the game awesome.

Battle is not a simple dice roles plus modifiers.  Each faction has a option to play a weapon and a defense that may block a weapon.  In addition, the number of troops committed to a battle can be supported by Spice which can double their affect.  A leader is added and he adds to the faction's strength -- unless, he is a TRAITOR.

Truely a fun game.  A little long and really is best with 6 players.

I've played only two or three times. The games were unbalanced because of mixed experience among the players (the first time you play it is difficult to develop a strategy due to the asymmetry of the roles). But it seems as though the game would work very well if all players have played a few times.

RATING: 9
Such a well designed game.  I still haven't figured out how to play this game (even though I have won it a few times), but I really enjoy this game.   I just can never figure out the best number of troops to send to battle with. The interactions between the players is what the game is for me.  I enjoy when deals are made and broken whenever the worms appear.

I cannot comment on the theme for the game since I've never read the books nor seen the movies/miniseries.  A reprint of the game in a different universe wouldn't bother me for that reason.  Fans of the books seem to love how the various races interact within the game and how they are perfectly represented in the game.  Myself, I just enjoy how the game is played.

Edited to say: I have finally read the original Dune novel and I can say how well the theme of the game fits the books.  The powers of each group fits perfectly with the book.  Such a well designed game.

Many GREAT ideas here, but the spirit of the 80s floats all over this title...  Looong playing time, downtime and player near-elimination are present.  

This would be a truly great game if somebody was able to cut the playing time and modernize the mechanics up to the modern standards.  Unfortuantely I don't know if it's possible without harming the setting of the game.  All these specific little rules and exceptions add flavour and create great climate.  It wouldn't be Dune without them...  I just don't see anythng fit to be cut out of the game immediately..

Areacontrol:bluffing:negotiations:alliances:traitors:auctions:variable player powers:

initial rating 1 play 6 players, don't expect any movement

[b]WOW[/b] Epic epic game and so far ahead of its time. This very unique game actually deserves it accolades. The game is bursting with THEME, maybe the most themactic game I have played, fantastic.

The game is EVIL, just like the movie/books, love it! One of the best multiplayer games I have played, it incorporates a lot of different elements and does it well. Tons of special powers, very cool combat system, alliances, negotiations, all very cool stuff. 

There are three big negatives, length of course, a game could play in 2 hours but could also run very very long, had this been a 3 hour game there sure would be more '10' ratings. Rules, I sure am glad we had an experienced player running our game, lots of rules and exceptions that will make picking the game up and playing hard after a layover. Randomness, the order cards come out (especially the worm and destruction of the wall) determine how the game will be shaped and there is no determining that. Balance is questionable also as two factions are constantly collecting spice (money) and always have money to outbid people for the cards, ship more men, etc. This is where alliances can hopefully come in depending on the worm of course.

Despite these negatives, which can be somewhat overcome with more play, this is a fantastic system that I look forward to playing again

Well, I really have enjoyed playing this game but it's hard to be 100% sure just how much I like it after just two plays, especially given the fact that the first time I played we expected it to be around 3-4 hours long, yet it took about 9 hours to teach and play it! On top of that, both times I was the Bene Geserrit who I don't think you should play for your first game since it's tough to play when you don't know what you're doing. All in all, I have a feeling I will really love this game after another play or two. The single greatest thematic game out there IMO.

This was my first chance to play the highly sought after game. It was an enjoyable game, but I thought it suffered from poor alliance rules. Any number of people can be in an alliance. This led to 3 players declaring an alliance against the two other players for an easy win.
Got a second chance to play, but with modified rules, all alliances need an extra siege for each extra member, (i.e. 2 person alliance needs 4 sieges, 3 person alliance needs all 5). This fixed the biggest flaw in the game that I saw and rated a bump in the score.

RATING: 9.7
Such a fantastic mix of theme and mechanics. The game is one of my favorites, behind only The Resistance, Werewolf, and Diplomacy. I could play this every week, especially if I didn't have to teach it every time. It takes a bit of effort to get a handle on the strategy for each of the specialized factions, but it's well worth it. Your second game will be much more fun than you first.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
The spice must flow and sometimes blood. An oldie but a good game. The main win condition is to control a certain amount of important stronghold locations on arrakis. Doing so you're trying to avoid sand storms, collect spice, form alliances, and backstab friends and family.

For first time players its probably best to limit alliances to 2 people unless you want a really short game as inexperienced players will just want to gang up. The fremen can be difficult to play for new players as well.

Overall a fun game with treachery and backstabbing that can last anywhere from 2 hours to an entire day if you use more advanced rules or play the optional no alliances rule.

Initial Rating: 9.5 (September 2011)

This is the game I first thought Cosmic Encounter (which disappointed me) should be. GREAT game. Surely with more plays this will crack my top ten of all-time favorite games :D.	

You want negotiation you’ve got it, you want betrayal, you have that too (you have also alliances, traitors, bluffing and much more). 

The gameplay is awesome (there are no dice). You need to play a different strategy according to your faction and you are so immersed in the game you don’t feel any downtime between turns. Very nice :D.

The game is a little complex (I like that) thus it can take a long time to explain the rules to new players (but is totally worth it).

The theme is incredible rich and accurate, fans of the Dune novel should play this right away (sadly, I have not read the book yet but all my fellow players have and they were ecstatic about that).

On the bad side I think the game needs 6 players to truly shine and Dune can take a long time, also the components can be hard to handle as they are very small.

Definitively my kind of game.

If you can get a copy of this DO IT! you won´t regret it.

Dune was in my Top Ten favorite games for years. I love the game and I will get a copy one way or another. It is a shame FFG couldn’t reprint it.  After I played Dune I read the novels and the game theme does justice to it.

Dune´s playtime can be very long or very short, if you play with less than 6 players the game can finish very quickly due to the alliances. Nowadays we always play that the alliance can be formed by two players only. If we allow 3 players alliances the game will finish very soon. 

As I´m currently doing my list of Top 100 games of all time, I have to downgrade Dune´s rating to denote my current feelings for the game. It is still a very good game, furthermore if you have into account the year it was published. I love it.

Current Rating: 8.0

I finally played Rex: Final days of an Empire and I can say, without a doubt, that Dune is the superior game in almost every way. Rex advantage over Dune can be summarized in: 1. Better components 2. Faster play, mainly due to decreased turn (only 8) and increased movement (2 for all the factions except Sol/Fremen which have 3).

In all other respects Dune is still the best game for me.

It’s been a long time since I last played Dune. I still have the game close to my heart, but I have to recognize that my desire to play it again isn’t as high as before. In these past couple of years, I have been drifting away from most Ameritrash games and I’m now firmly on the Euro camp. Still I won’t say no to a game of Dune.

Deserves to be the classic it is. There's definitely something to say for variable player powers, all of which seem game-breaking on first glance.  Yet amazingly the game still seems balanced.  When and how to reach for victory seems like an extremely difficult skill to master.  Ultimately Dune's emphasis on conflict and de-emphasis on character growth will keep this title from being among my favorite of the Avalon Hill classics, but it's more than worth a play every few months or so.

**NOSTALGIA RATING**

This...this is a classic!

I loved the first novel of the series (it's one of my favorite Sci-Fi books ever) and this game catches the theme so very well.

Duplicitous bastards conniving against you, brilliant play, alliances, battles...a classic.

Long, but worth it.

I sold my Avalon Hill version, bought the French (for the expansions) and am going to make a wood board for it in the future.

By today's standards, I'd clock it at about an 8...so not that much off actually, damn it was good back then (still is actually).

Dune captures the essence of the novels brilliantly. It truly feels like you are playing out the characters, events, and places from the novels.

Race to control Arakis through troops that are paid for based on spice haul and/or CHOAM charity - though beware the traitors in your faction. Follows the books fairly well, but what makes this game stand out is the battling mechanic: you hide how much you are wagering and which leader adds their power until it's time to show, and you can add one weapon and defence in a one-shot try to negate the other's power.

BIG PLUS: battle mechanic, long rules but simple to play, follows the book
BIG MINUS: really works best with more players

MEGA MINUS: this game is not in print any more… and it should be!!!

This is one of the sacred cows of gaming, and I've seen it slaughtered quite a bit on BGG. Some of the innovations in the game haven't aged very well, and the rules are a bit of a mess with all their exceptions and ambiguities, so there's fair grounds for criticism. Nevertheless, it's a majestic fusion of mechanics and theme. Everything--even the clunky parts--seems to fit the Dune universe remarkably well. 

I know we're just starting to scratch the surface of what's possible in the metagame. Bribery, pseudo-alliances, threats, backstabbing...the game is fertile territory for all of it, and when you're fumbling through the first couple times it's hard to know the relative value of territories, information, and the use of each faction's special abilities. I can read Pug's excellent series of strategy guides and understand them much better now. The alliance wins do seem a bit deflating, but it's up to everyone else to band together and get in the way, something we didn't do (or even cajole each other to try). 

Flawed? Yes, definitely by today's standards. Ugly? The original game, sure--that's why I built my own. But I won't be able to get the game off my mind anytime soon, and I'm itching to play again, because I'm certain it'll get even better with repetition.

Nice game but some races seem more fun to play than others... also if some players are weaker, depending on which race they play, it can cause imbalance in the game.

The game really needs an component upgrade, it's really a shame FFG couldn't get the Dune license. Although to be honest, the game is fairly abstract... Spice is just money in this game really.

Rare: a uniquely happy marriage of narrative and mechanics. I can't imagine what it would be like to play not knowing the Dune universe. Overly complex. Dozens of plays in and we still get the rules wrong. Six players all but mandatory. But the design keeps giving (and giving in, to story). Here imbalance is virtue. Six factions that resist and enable each other in delightful ways. The Bene Gesserit may never win, but never-winning has never been so fun. Defeat here has the glow of defeat in narrative: somehow it's more interesting, more vital. Games need drama. The story of numbers adds up to nothing. Full disclosure: I hated math until I discovered it had imaginary numbers.

An almost perfect DUNE game.  I've played this game for years & have an itching to play it again soon.  I'd post how many times I've played it but I can't remember from all the "spice" my friends & I smoked during our sessions.  That's right.  We turned it into something MORE than a drinking game, using spice counters as the trigger to "partake".  Don't bogart the "spice."

It's a shame the licensing for this game can't be worked out for a re-release.  It's great if you like Dune and long, long games.  60 minute playing time is a joke.  180 is more like the minimum.  The game takes between 1 to 2 hours per player.  With 6 people expect a 6-12 hour game, and bring food.  Plan on 2 extra hours just to explain the rules to first timers.

A pretty simple wargame based around the world of Dune. It played quickly and the special powers for each faction added an interesting element to the game, but I was dismayed by the lack of victory conditions in the game. The only way to win is to control strongholds, there are no bonuses for controlling spice/spice production (which would've suited the theme better)

This game is incredible. It fully captures the harsh feel of Arrakis. Battles are bloody (annihilation of both sides is not uncommon), assassination of your characters is unavoidable, and no city is truly safe. We find the game has a strong theme of biding your time then pouncing with full force, but while some races start with a stronger map presence than others, all will get their chance at glory!

The game shows off some fantastic theme from the Dune universe (if a bit of 70s camp/kitsch), and staying true to the story every faction plays very differently and with real character. Its much better to play with 6 players to really get the full flavour and inter-relationship between the very diverse factions.

This is a real hard core war and politics game: if you take it seriously a game should take at least 5 hours. Not for the faint of heart. Because of this, it can be a little AP prone, but the experience is worth it!

If I were to change anything about the game, it would be to make the victory conditions a little less focussed around control of cities, and I would like to see the alliance rules a bit clearer.

I love this game, though my version is older than the one described here.  It is only good with a lot of players.  There are a lot of nice touches here, especially the treachery cards and special powers of each faction.  Even players who have not read the book, can enjoy the game.

RATING: 8
One of the strongest themes in a boardgame so far, and does a great job capturing the feel of the books. The factions aren't really balanced, but they are different enough to let it slide. The fighting mechanic is excellent. To a point. 'Cause everything comes down to the luck with the Treachery cards. Great game nonetheless. Somewhere up there, Mr. Herbert must be smiling...

I've only played this once, and not for about five or six years, but every time I even think about it I start to drool...

Of course, I lost as the Bene Gesserit about two or three rounds in. Probably not the best faction to pick when you're a n00b.

RATING: 2
after lot of thoughts I must say I dislike this game. Everything is not completely bad and I like hidden combat but negative factors outweight it for me.

First of all it plays quite long and second issue which is even more highlighted by long playing time is that I think some alliances are too powerfull (I mean those fractions which can read your combat plan - if there is alliance of Atreides and second reading side you are limited to decide very few things and this broke it for me). In such situation I knew that 80% of time I will loose combat and there is nothing I could do against that and it was too frustrating.

If I had to rate this game on the 1 play of it I had it would be well below a 5.  The rules as written are broken.  Particularly alliances.  
I am willing to try this again when I find the common house rules and hope it becomes the multiple paths to victory, asymmetrical, alliance making and breaking, game of supreme awesomeness that I thought it would be.

RATING: 6
Based on 2 plays.  I got to admit, this was a bit of a let-down.  I loved the the theming and the unique special abilities were fun, but as a game itself... eh.  A lot of the mechanics, such as the bid for blind cards, seem clunky and dated.  The alliance system has interesting potential, but in our matches it often led to a rapid endgame.  And at times it dragged, esp. when the politicking got excessive.  Still, there's enough of a game there to be enjoyable every once in a while, given the theming.

First game of Dune! I was done for as Harkonnen by turn two--over-aggressive play in the beginning seems like a good thing with these guys, but it needs to be balanced with smart use of spice. Oh, and don't leave Carthag vulnerable to counterattacks (idiot).

Honestly, despite the fact that I spent much of the game licking my wounds, I can't stop thinking about how I would've played differently given more experience (hide out in the Polar Sink for while, just biding my time...then BOOM, take advantage of Carthag's extra movement and wipe those bastard Fremen off the map!...maybe). 

This really seems like a game to grow into.  And now that I've played I don't find the rules overhead nearly as intimidating.  I'm actually looking forward to teaching this one and getting everyone into it.  Oh, and I call Guild next time.

Wow, I finally played this.  It is tense and pretty fast playing with 6 players, especially for a 3+ hour game.  The rounds quickly become intuitive and the player powers are just a blast to use.  If you're into the books at all, this game is layered with thematic elements that create the feeling of being in Frank Herbert's world.  I can't think of any other game that does this so successfully.

I got this off ebay, and it has only managed to hit the table once so far.  I really like this game, even if I don't get to play it often.  The variable player powers, differing goals, uncertain alliances, and secret traitors are just a few things that make this game rich.  I am also a fan of Frank Herbert's work, and so that is an added bonus.  (Rating based on: 1 FTF play)

Unsure from one play. For all the dicelessness, the cards and traitors seemed very swingy, with as much luck as bluff in most of the combats.

It feels like I'm in the miniority of people that have actually played both games but prefer Rex.  Dune is a much stronger IP and the game has the nostalgia factor for me as I played it as a kid but these days streamlining things a little bit is a good thing.  As it is I just don't try to defend either game to the haters that just don't get it. I ultimately got rid of Rex as well for that reason but would gladly join in playing either version of someone else's game.  It's a wildly asymmetrical but balanced system where the game is your special powers.  The combat system is what puts off a lot of players I've played with but I personally love it.

RATING: 7
Thematically it is very strong and I see why some people like this game, but I couldn't enjoy it. Everything revolves around quick combats which can be devastating even if you win. Every round people blindly bid for cards - very random. Also, I don't like the movement constrictions and the lack of resource grabbing options (some factions constantly get free money but spice itself only appears into one place per round).
The idea of a circular board around which a storm moves is quite neat though and the combat mechanics are okay. I'd still rather play Dominant Species or Game of Thrones if I'm in the mood for a long heavy area movement game.

This is a long and possibly bitter game, especially if all six regular factions are playing.  House rules (to layer on top of the existing morass of rules) and perhaps certain missing factions can definitely improve things (like the inevitable win for overly large alliances).

There are interesting ideas and mechanics. But in over all, I don't like much the game. I played with the spice harvest expansion.

The spice harvest is a pretty cool mechanic, but I would have prefered using it during each of the game's turn, not as a game setup minigame.

Unless you play emperor or guild, you are always short in money because spice cost so much to acquire that it actually does not worth it to try capture spice. So I would have loved to use the spice havest rules each turn so that you could have more diplomatic influence during the game on other players and so that there could be a minimum income of spice that enters the game.

Also the map is so big for the limited movements you are allowed to do in a turn. So maybe with a smaller map and more mobility, it would have been more interesting.

I would have loved to have the feeling of "push your luck". Do you risk collecting spice, do you stay to collect more or should you wait for a better opportunity. You don't get that feeling when playing dune

So there is place for improvement. I am curious to see the new FFG version.

RATING: 9
Best with 6 and one of my all-time favorite 6-player games.  It has the potential and likelihood of being a long game (3+ hrs) which is why I like the original rules of allowing for Alliances (provided the two rivals can never be allied this way).   
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Excellent negotiation game with each character having different powers.  Watch the alliances as some can create powerful combos.  The traitor element is a nice touch as everyone gets to pick at least one traitor to serve them from four leader chips that are drawn (pay attention to the leader chips you draw that are yours too as they are obviously not treacherous)!  Develops a bit of paranoia in the game, particularly if you are facing the Harkonnen who could have four traitors under their control!  

However, one does have to be aware that playing this for the first couple times will require dedication and quite a bit of time - my only play with five took us almost 5 hours.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Rating after 2 plays. I was a little bit disappointed after finally having played the game with having read all the hype beforehand (Best ever... BEST 6 player game...). But my expectation was really high. After thinking about it, I give it a 7. The asymmetrical player powers seem to be fairly balanced and the game mechanics carry the theme very well. However, the game can end very quickly when players are not concentrating on the game and are too unexperienced. We played with the basic AH ruleset (the player or alliance that first controls 3 Strongholds at the end of the turn wins the game) and both games were won by 3-player alliances quite early in the game. Next time we have to try the house rule single person 3 strongholds, 2-player alliance 4 strongholds and 3  alliances 5 strongholds. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
So much interlocking things going on in this game. I love variable player power, but I wonder if this one just has too much to make the game kind of predictable, at least in a sense of strategy (depending upon which faction you play).  At lest five more plays of this will be required before I have something a firm grasp on the game.

Admittedly, I have only played this game once and it was only with four players but it was very disappointing.  The factions seemed imbalanced in our game (the Emperor and particularly the Guild having enormous influence due to their spice income). Two players began the game in control of two strngholds each and could have won on turn one due to an alliance (which we avoided just because it seemed too stupid).  After turn four one of them had won independently.  The alliance rules seemed broken to me (maybe they work better with the full compliment of players.  It's really a shame as I enjoyed the asymmetrical powers and found the combat system, spice blow mechanism and the variable storm progression interesting.

RATING: 8
Perhaps this is the only good game and the best one in wargaming history based on a popular book first and then a movie.  As successful as it is, it almost brings (and in fact in response to the prevailing mood at the time) sci-fi games to the high tide in late 70's.  A game which recreates most faithfully to the world as described in a sci-fi fiction.  You can be immersed in it. Played this once and won.  The strategies each faction can adopt are so fun!

I got this game for Christmas , early '80s . Played hundreds of times back then ( still have all pieces intact ) . The one mechanic I was always impressed with is that this is a strategy game that doesn't involve a single die roll. I suppose the weather tokens could be substituted with a d6 but only if one is lost or missing. Great game . And since the six box art is taken from the book before the movie its interesting how close the characters look ( except of course the Guild . A lizard in trunks?)

This game did manage to convey the book in an interesting way.  The six factions flawlessly mesh mechanics with theme.  The hard-diplomacy is one of the best I've seen implemented, and the variable player plowers are near unbeatable.  The combat is pretty weird, though, and you need to make sure that you raise the win-condition limits as you add players to alliances.

RATING: 9
This game is pretty brilliant, actually. The rules seem a little convoluted at first, but they actually only take up half a dozen pages, and after the first few turns play flows quite smoothly. The strategy required is pretty deep, but not brain-busting. What's most impressive, though, is how the Magic the Gathering/Cosmic Encounter-style rules exceptions mirror the traits of actual races and characters in the book, while at the same time keeping the game remarkably well-balanced. By the end of my first play-through, I was frankly in awe of the designer for having pulled this off. My only complaint is that the alliances mechanic makes the game a little too prone to sudden reversals when you're playing with fewer than five participants.

RATING: 7.25
Great game, in that the variable player powers make for such intersting interactions.  I'd rate it higher if it took less than 4 hours to play.  Lot's of diplomatic/allegience/backstabbing tension.  Very advanced game for 1979.

I have dropped this down to a 4 as I have not liked this game.  There are aspects which are great.  But I don't want to play a game for 10-12 hours.  Its just not fun.  And this game can be very un-fun.  The hidden traitor is brilliant when you can win a battle that is critical.  The battle system is similar to Game of Thrones, and this is where it takes far too long just like GoT.  

The problem I have is the one step forward two steps back aspect of the game.  You occupy areas end up having a battle and half your forces are wiped out and it takes three turns to rebuild.  Watching two other players agonize over battle choices is not much fun either.

This is a great game, that it should not have taken me so long to play.  But, then again, I should have read the book sooner, too.  I can see how it might drag on in some circumstances.  The combat mechanics allow for great double and triple think moments.

Totally brilliant. A classic and the perfect blend of simple Euro mechanics with AT-style deeply integrated theme. Difficult decisions abound, and you really feel the tension rise as the battle for Arrakis takes shape. The game also gives you plenty of diplomacy options, and its extremely dynamic nature makes any form of turtling impossible. Huge fun factor unless you're one of those players who can't stand backstabbing.

This is a game that had been built up to a level that would be hard to achieve, so this one was a little disappointing once I finally got it to the table.  That being said, I still found the game very enjoyable.  The group I played it with was very fun, so I kind of get the feeling that the group determines the enjoyment of this game.

Epic game of treachery and negotiation, Dune is an enjoyable journey. The different race characteristics make for a highly entertaining game.

Multiplayer confrontational game based on diplomacy, blind bidding, card drawing... quite poor overall (and the different powers of the players are intentionally overpowered).
Possibly better for fans of the book.

This game was a great find, hidden as it was on the shelves of a local gaming store. My friends were initially excited to play but after several sessions, their feeling toward the game turned sour. One reason was the complexity of the rules and the fact that we only had one rule sheet in English (Yes, this is my fault for not downloading one of the many player aids on the Geek). Another was that the 2 most powerful factions (Empire and Space Guild) would typically ally, subduing most of the competition and killing of the other player's motivation. This game seems like it has a lot of potential (and we never even got a chance to use the expansions) so hopefully I'll get a chance in the future.

The guy who introduced this game to me has a theory that Dune must have had a heavy influence on the European game designers responsible for "Euro" games.  I'm not sure if that's true historically, but it has the ring of truth to me theoretically.  Given the choice, however, I'd rather play Dune than any Euro I know.  Highly recommended...if you can find it.

RATING: 9.8
This game is genius and some of the most saturated gaming enjoyment to be had. The overall game is pretty simple in the rules, but shockingly intricate and flexible in strategy and possibilities. No two games are going to feel the same, despite the same set-up. (contrast this with a game like Axis&Allies, where the set-up is always the same and the game typically starts and unfolds the same way, dictated really by how the dice of the battles unfold). Dune isn't going to feel different because lack of dice, but more so based on player choices and interactions. 
The game flys by. You don't feel the downtime, even when playing with the Duel expansion (where the game will stop as two players duel each other). 
Rich in strategy, deception, intrigue and player interaction. The game is extremely fluid; the balance of the game can dramatically shift from turn to turn and even within the turn, so you have to stay on your toes, constantly reassessing possible alliances, bribes, challenges and priorities. 
The duel expansion was great fun. It added a pretty tense and suspensful element to the game that even the invested spectators feel. You have to choose which side you think will win; if you chose correctly, you win some much needed spice. If you loose, you loose the leader you sent to support the combantant. 
The game and some of the cards offer some very open and creative ways of engaging the game; Kanly (for challenging duels). Declare a specific action and a player, if it happens, you duel.
"If the Guild ship a troop to the Funeral Flats, we duel". 
The truth serum card is also fabulous; you force an opponent to answer a Yes/No question. "Are you going to attach the Fremen this turn" 
Its the little elements like this, plus the unique faction advantages, the low reliance on randomness for battle, and the amount of player interaction that affrds this game to be one of the best.

[b]First impression of the game?[/b]
Fun game. It's cool to play an old classic and experience some of the game mechanics that are still influencing games today.

[b]What are the highlights?[/b]
There are a lot of nifty little ditties in this game. The traitor element can be devastating and significantly affects decision-making. The rotating storm adds uncertainty and a need for caution. The alliances add a great deal of variability.

[b]What are the drawbacks?[/b]
The nature of the mechanics creates some ambiguities which requires a lot of rules lookup. Some of the faction powers seem unbalanced but I could be convinced otherwise with more plays. Both of our initial plays (11/14/09) ended with a Harkonnen/Empire alliance victory.

[b]Who would enjoy this game?[/b]
Obviously people who love the Dune universe of Frank Herbert's books are going to eat this up. However, I don't believe knowledge of the books or movies is a prerequisite. 

[b]Who would [i]not[/i] enjoy this game?[/b]
This is definitely a gamers' game. Game length (2 - 4 hour) and potential rules-lawyering prevents this from being a good family game.

[b]Would you play this game again?[/b]
Yes, I could definitely see playing this game once or twice a year. It is a neat little game with a lot of thematic elements that I like in games like Fury of Dracula with combat and negotiation components of old-style Ameritrash games.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Just a note, I knew I was going to love the game just by reading the rules.

I punched out my new but not so new copy of Dune and have never looked back. The game has everything I expect from a game.

Variable Player Powers - The 6 different factions make for a game where each player has a unique set of abilities to draw from within the game. This also fits perfectly within the theme of the novel. 

Treacherous Backstabbing Harkonnens 
Subtle but Brutal Bene Gesserit
Native Stillsuit-Wearing Fremen
Guild and their Shipping Monopoly
Prescient Atreides
Mighty Emperor

Negotiation, Extortion, Bribing - The game cries out for alliances. The player who can wheel and deal the best will see themselves on the profiting end of things.

Diceless Combat - The battle system simply works. There's a great deal of thought that can be put into every battle. Are you going to dial up your troops? Are you going to risk a strong leader? What are the odds of your opponent having this defense/offense? 

Mindgames - In Dune, you play against your enemies as much as the game itself. There's lots of room to bluff and coerce other players into doing your bidding.

RATING: 4
Maybe my experience wasn't optimal and my expectations were too high, but I found this game to simply be okay.  It didn't measure up well to the reverence and lifestyle status some people give it.

Playing it a second time didn't change much.  It is interesting, and pretty good for it's age, but it still didn't impress me that much.  It was too easy for one or two players to be almost totally crushed fairly quickly.

Third time wasn't the charm either.  The problem this time had to do with the difficulty in reading and understanding the rules.

3 plays; 5 and 6 players

RATING: 10
What a great game. The theme is huge in this game, so if you are a Dune fan you will like this. If you are not a big Dune fan then the game itself is one of the better multi-player conflict type games out there. It has special powers that seem to work well without being unbalanced. (I have not played with expansions)

I like this one a lot and now that the ice has been broken with the group I hope it sees a lot of table time.

A bit complex due to the numerous special powers of each player. But that makes for a very rich theme. Each game is a story in itself.

The hype is totally lived up to.

The biggest problem is that there is a pretty serious learning curve. The basics are pretty easy to deal with, but the need to know all the rule braking special faction powers and unique rule questions makes the first play (or 5) far from what they could be. Even in the first game though it's easy to see how amazing the game has the potential to be.

4 / 5 - Great.

This is a mad game. I'm not aware of any other title that screws without your head quite so much in terms of feeding drips of information to individual players and making everyone excruciatingly paranoid. Every decision you make is a horrible combination of mechanical strategy (no dice, remember) and hidden information: the tension is palpable. Indeed if anything the game is almost too tense. The legendary manner in which the game connects to the source material hardly needs further discussion and is well deserved. However the near-requirement for 5-6 players for a satisfying session is a shame.

Instantly fell in love with this game. There is no other game that seems to mix theme with war so well as this one (that I've played yet). I loved the fact that each faction you pick gives you radically different strategies, aligning you to different goals. The storm marker always kept it tense, and this game does have the BEST battle system I've played to date, bar none.

Full Game Review available in game forum.

When you have exactly 6 players and enough time to finish playing, this is simply the best game I've ever played. The pace is slow, the decisions hard, and your gaming group will need to come up with some measures for dealing with these elements to suit you.

That being said, the Storm mechanic is one of the best ever created, the theme is great, and the asymmetry is extremely well done (unless you have less than 6 players, then the game becomes terrible). A lot of newer games are using modified versions of the combat system, which is a good thing.

Extremely frustrating until you know what you are doing and how everything works, but once you get it the payoff is big.

Now own the French version, and it looks really great.  This game was so far ahead of its time: diceless combat, area control, the diplomacy, multiple player abilities.  It has stood up for almost 30 years.  Those Eon guys really were amazing.

WOW - this is the ultimate in player interaction.  It faithfully catches the flavor of the books.  The intrigue and dealings are tense and masterful.  Battle is very interesting - how much are you willing to risk (lose) to win?  Always read for a 5 or 6 way game of this one.

RATING: 8
It would be easy to point out Dunes so called flaws compared to modern designer board games if you wanted to approach it like that. Dune is not pretty, it's unforgiving, rules can be a handful, playing time is unpredictable and so on. But if you are able to look past that you'll find a game that offers something its modern counterparts do not. The variable player powers in Dune are variable indeed like in nowhere else and powerful with a punch, yet suprisingly balanced. Negotiations and alliances rule over combat, which itself is agonizing fun. And the setting of course is lovely and perfectly executed. The spice must flow.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I really like how the various factions are completely different yet mostly balanced (except maybe the Freemen, and, to a lesser extent, the Harkonnen). Definitely depends on everyone keeping an eye on their neighbour. Not so much a big fan of the overly "chromy" rules; I'd rather be playing a game than a simulation of the book. Games tend to be short and bloody, which can be anti-climatic (I have heard of first-turn wins).

RATING: 9
May be the best themed game in existence.  I couldn't imagine anyone playing without first being familiar with the Dune storyline.  Tons of treachery, alliances, stategems and suprises.  Everybody seems to have their own variant-preferences and rule interpretations so hammer those out as much as possible before you start playing.

A classic... enough to make this Euro gamer salivate with anticipation.  Very engrossing in the Dune universe and faithful (to the first Herbert book).  Amazingly fun play with full 6 players... alliances, rivalries, complementary powers!  Good stuff, wish they'd get license to reprint!

Excellent atmosphere.  I like the combat resolution system.  One of the better science fiction games and an excellent multi-player game.

This game design was well ahead of it's time and holds up very well today.  A classic game design imo.

Better than most modern multi-player, direct conflict with diplomacy games that I'm aware of (e.g. A Game of Thrones).

My initial plays of Dune have been fantastic, though I think I was always going to like this game given my love for the Dune universe. This game achieves a ton of thematic flavor and immersion with what is ultimately a fairly simple set of mechanisms (the rules complications mostly come from the various faction-specific powers). This is an epic (and often very long) game that I won't get to play often but will always relish when I do.

Notes: My copy is a custom version of Ilya's redesign crafted by Andrew Tullsen at Print and Play Productions.

RATING: 7
Really elegant combat system, probably the best one I've seen in any game so far.  All the roles are fairly different which makes replay value high.  Thought the mobilization was fairly frustrating though, but the combat system and leader mechanics more than made up for that.  Never read Dune before but the game got me interested.  The different treachery cards add a lot to the strategy of the game.  Liked the auction system a lot as well.  Probably would have liked it more if I didn't play it at 10 pm to 2:30 am!

RATING: 7

RATING: 8.5
First play confirms, this game lives up to its reputation. In our four player game, it was an absolute smack-down knife fight to the end, climaxing in round six between myself as Fremen and another player as Atreides. Vicious combat, complex metagame (auctions, bribery, alliances, backstabs) quirky special powers that remind me of Cosmic Encounter (gee, wonder why?) Hesitant to rate it higher than this for now, but maybe future plays will allow me to acknowledge its superiority.

------------

Second visit to the desert planet was absolutely brutal - ended up winning with a three-way alliance. It's an interesting game, but I feel like things don't really get moving until the first worm appearance and the nexus it causes. In this case, it was two hours into game play. There doesn't seem to be a good way to fix this - if you intentionally dealt a Shai Hulud card every four or five cards, than players would plan accordingly and some of the dramatic tension of one showing up would be lost.

Also during this play we played with a few rules wrong, which completely and totally changed the game - we got Bene Gesserit unit placement wrong, and space landing wrong. Next time should be an even better game.

Works best with full complement of players, however the game can be anti-climatic with a premature allied victory.  Conversely, the game can drag on in a protracted stalemate with paritied alliances.  The game is showing its age, though, as the components are underwhelming.  The map is way too small for a 6 player game; the tokens are difficult to handle and place inside the tiny territories.  The perforated tiny cards are a nightmare to shuffle and get damaged easily.  Consequently, this game would benefit greatly from an update/reprint.

Not a Dune fan, but a Sci-Fi theme is nice to see.  The game plays pretty smooth with wonderful combat mechanics.  I hate the randomness of the storm and worms.  I don't like the fiddly extra rules to make it more Dune-like.  I'd prefer if the system where gutted out and transported to a different setting.  I don't like alliances winning (I want a single victor).

I had to make my own game to play this.  The BGG files are wonderful to have available, but the game isn't exactly the prettiest.

RATING: 9
Dune does a great job combining theme and great game play. It is said it borrowed mechanics from Cosmic Encounter, but whatever they did AH made a game that really clicks for me. There are some serious rule ambiguities. We try to use the most recent rules here on BGG since they have been through the wringer a few times with fellow players.

My relation to dune is ... complicated. I want to like, because it has some interesting mechanics and my friends love this game.
Yet I it still did not click with me. Why? Hard to say. I like the game offers you a foundation for diplomacy, treaties and betrayal, but I do not like that you have to wait for an event to build or break treaties.
Having to sacrifice troops for fighting power leads to tough choices, but I feel they are underpowerd compared to the leaders. Also I hate the fact they are only worth half a power point. Would it be so complicated to make whole numbers?
The game basicaly eliminates chance, which is good and bad. Because you have to pay attention all the time! I want to play to have fun, but the level of commitment Dune requires feels tiring, leading to missing or forgetting important information, leading to defeat and being yelled at be your treaty partner.

It's a great game, but... Here's the thing. It can be over in about seven minutes. Or it can be tense and well fought for 60+ and then end in an instant. I don't herd with dumbshit nerds, OK? But, you move early in rotation and forget to close the back door to Carthag or Arakeen? Oops, game's over. I'll always play it, there just seems to be that one piece missing.

And no, those missing pieces are not included in the two 'expansions'. That said, guilty secret: I don't hate those near as much as I'm supposed to.

I have the cool worm version with the strange Fremen. Way better than the Movie one. Wonder if the same dude in charge of that decision also put Burton and Taylor on Civilization?

Different factions on Dune (Harkonnen, Atredies, etc) compete for spice and avoiding worms. Combat resolved by selecting a personailty from the household and playing other cards. 

"But Sir, you promised me a Harkonnen!" 

Neat idea of different factions with different abilities and ways to win the game. Would have a higher rating if the game wasn't so unstable (nucleonics could wipe out a bunch of forces), and once the Harkonnen lose all their troops, they are basically out. Games typically clock in at more than two hours.

RATING: 10
Played about 15+ times. Love the theme, balance of play and the length. Once you have a grasp of the rules, one of the best  multiplay games around. If you like the Dune books then this is a must. My wife loves the game and I normally play it with couples. We don't change any rule interpretation during a game but wait for the next.

[b]Dune[/b] by [person=34][/person], [person=35][/person], [person=36][/person]

A legendary gamer´s game that has been out-of-print for ages. It has been re-implemented recently (in 2012) by a stream-lined [thing=104363][/thing]. Some players are not happy with it, while others are. The greatest sticking point is the Dune theme itself, since the rights to it could not be procured. The publisher of Rex instead used their own Twilight Imperium universe for the game´s setting.

For players unfamiliar to Dune (which is originally a Sci-Fi novel written by Frank Herbert):

Unlike most IP tie-ins, this is a great game and does a very good job capturing the feel of Dune.

I really like the mechanics for this. Combat is determined by the value of your commander as well as how many of your troops you are willing to sacrifice.

There is also a good amount of treachery and scheming.

And of course, it centers around the Spice.

A true classic and perhaps the finest game ever made. Sure, that's saying a lot, but this gem merits the praise.
The perfectly balanced asymmetry, diceless system (rare in an American game) and faithfulness to the genre make Dune shine, and its lustre hasn't faded a bit in the 30 years since it was first printed.

I have always enjoyed this game, even when I lose. It is an interesting game in that each player is quite different. Best when all 6 powers are playing. And winning as a weaker power (read Bene Gesserit or the Guild) can be an added bonus.

I have even won with the Bene Gesserit "sight" rule. Also, never let X-man play the Baron. He is just too good at it.

A classic! Finally able to play this one thanks to discovering a new member for our gaming group. I wouldn't pay $100 for a copy, but it was still a large amount of fun nonetheless. Some things are less than intuitive from our modern perspective, but the way that the individual factions play so differently is pretty cool.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The most striking aspect of the board game is the theme recreation, cleverly designed to reflect the Dune universe. Fans will appreciate the many details included there; the player abilities, the map, the turn process, evertyhing makes sense. At the end of the day, it's an area control game with abstract victory conditions, but during the gameplay you will feel you are representing your family, etc.

Another great feature of Dune is the inequality of the races. It's not that they have different stats or posess some loose exclusive skill. They are REALLY different. And their differences are VERY powerul and have a HUGE impact in the game. This has been said about many games, but in Dune it's more true than in any other: the game experience and strategies change completely depending on who you play with.

There are some aspects where the game shows its age, though, like the player elimination. It's a feature present in very few of the recent games, and certainly in no "hours-long" game. It is indeed a problem, because in most instances, players need to be eliminated in order for someone to win. And being eliminated when there's still more than one hour to go is not nice.

I have not played enough to have a strong opinion about this game and my game experience was "contaminated" by the inclusion of its 2 expansions. It's not a game up my alley, but it has enough attractiveness to be played once per year.

PS: I owned a copy of Rex: Final Days of an Empire, but I immediately sold it. The theme is so rich that it doesn't make sense to play it outside the Dune universe.

Have not played for several years, but recently had the chance to get a second-hand copy, so reconsidering this game and its rating:
A large part of my antipathy is due to a couple of the people who taught me the game - over competitive and politicking far too much for a game with new players. Complete twerps, in fact.
There is a learning curve, and the rules are unfriendly.
The pieces are poor by today's standards.
[i]Dune[/i] only works with 5-6 players.
Theme is "meh" IMO. Frank Herbert bored me to tears.

OTOH: it is interesting because of the asymetry, and there is little downtime.

[i]Will try again, probably with people who don't care about the books.[/i]

First play with 6 players: 45 minutes to teach the rules (with more explanations as they came up) and 4 hours to play to round 10. It was worth it! I loved what I call 'the muttering phase' where alliances are made and everyone plots in whispers and hushed voices.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
A perfect translation of the book to game form.  Asymmetrical play and so many permutations ensure the game will not pall.  Easy to learn  mechanics but difficult to master.  My favourite faction is the Bene Gesserit.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Preliminary rating after 2 plays (5p), French edition. 

A game that meets all my expectations, that's for sure. It mechanically feels A LOT like Cosmic Encounter, the atmosphere is very different though.
I won't deny that we may have missed or mixed up rules to some extent, but the game seems to come with a truely fundamental defect resulting from the alliance victory option that is offering no incentives for expelling any player from an alliance or for a strong fraction to ally with a weaker one. House rule essentially required, otherwise simply broken. Could be an 8 or 9 if the issue was fixed.

House rule idea: A maximum of 2 fractions may constitute an alliance.

I wasn't expecting much from this game, but I must say that I've been favorably surprised. Nice atmosphere, reminiscent enough of the books. The bluffing component of the combat system is really fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Quite long, and a lot of rules to read first - but the game does really fit the Dune universe, and is fun to play if you're a sci-fi fan.

Of course graphics really look "vintage" by now, but it's part of the fun.

RATING: 9
Since it is just the 3 of us (myself and 2 kids still living at home) playing this multiplayer game, it took us quite a few plays to figure out the best "mix" for just 3 players. IMHO in a 3 player game use House Atreides, the Fremen and the Emperor along with the basic rules. We tried many other combinations and this one seemed the most balanced and the most fun to play. This is one very well desiged game. On top of that, it follows the book very well. One of the smoothest book-to-game translations I have seen. Finding a good copy can be difficult and a medium to cheap expense. So it is worth the time and money.

RATING: 6
Thematically superb. But ... there aren't that many decisions to make in the game; its not continually engaging. You do the best you can with your power. The strength of these powers (and the ability to shoot for victory) waxes and wanes, and therefore for reasonable periods when you don't have a shot at it, there's not much of interest to do. However, the quality and importance of the decisions you make in Dune are crucial, as opposed to many multi-player games where there numerous engaging decisions to make through the game, but few in themselves are crucial. The big attraction is the alliance capability with its scope for diplomacy and it's prerequisite setup to bring something to the negotiation table. I'm happy enough to play if others want to explore, as long as everyone's committed to keeping the game moving.

Generally a very long game and it takes a few plays to get to know most of the cards and their effects, but a very rewarding game nevertheless and a lot of fun if you're a fan of the book!

If I had to sum this game up quickly, I suppose the best comment would be "Fun, but frustrating."  Dune introduced (well, introduced them to me, at least) a number of interesting ideas and mechanics that I've seen appear in later games.  It also does an interesting job of capturing the flavor of the different factions that feature in the books.  There's also good strategy and tactics to satisfy the serious gamer.

If the game "falls down," it's due to the interaction of different victory conditions and factions.  It's amazingly annoying (to many, anyway) to win the game as the Harkonnens on turn 4, only to find out that the Bene Gesserit had predicted that win and therefore win instead of you.  For some in our group, these types of interactions kill the joy in the game and leave it on the shelf (far too frequently, if you ask me).

But I like it and it usually gets a few votes when it's time to pick a game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The amazingly beautiful fan redesign by Ilya.

Clanky, complicated, unbalanced, ambiguous (with all the different variant rules out there), hard to learn and get into (your first play is likely going to be frustrating), can end on turn 1 or drag to turn 15, erratic and volatile (one round of bidding can change the power dynamics), unforgiving and the special powers of the factions really narrows down the paths to victory to each faction.

BUT oh so epic, and a terrific implementation of the theme. With the beautiful fan-made version, this game is really an intense experience that makes or breaks your day.

Finalmente ho giocato a Dune, la leggenda, il mito senza tempo, il Kwisatz Haderach dei giochi da tavolo, e ne sono rimasto soddisfatto.
Innanzitutto è talmente coinvolgente e calato nell'ambientazione che sembra quasi un gioco di ruolo (ah, l'Atomique de Famille!). Le regole sono cucite addosso alle sei razze, e le abilità assegnate sono così pesanti nell'economia della partita che c'è una strategia diversa per ogni gruppo scelto. 
Inoltre, ho giocato a pochi giochi con così tanta interazione tra i giocatori. Il sistema di gioco è al servizio dell'ambientazione: i traditori, le minacce e i duelli rendono bene l'atmosfera da "fantascienza feudale" che pervade il libro (e il film), la tempesta di Coriolis perenne e le insidie del deserto ben rappresentano Arrakis.
Le battaglie - senza dado, un caso più unico che raro - sono originalissime.
Infine, le molteplici condizioni di vittoria, che cambiano a seconda della razza e dell'alleanza, mettono ancora più pepe a un gioco che di per se' è già molto speziato.
Per ultimo, i (pochi) difetti:
- Dura tantissimo: suppongo che un tavolo di giocatori esperti faccia lievitare ulteriormente i tempi.
- Regole difficili: il primo impatto col gioco è devastante. A mio parere le regole sentono un po' i morsi del tempo.
- Componenti non all'altezza: dagli anni '80 a oggi la grafica nei boardgame ha fatto passi da gigante. La rotella per i combattimenti è "gratuita" :)
- Bilanciamento delle razze: a occhio sembra che qualcuno sia più svantaggiato degli altri.

I remember this game as being incredible, I had picked it up sometime between 1989 and 1991. I understand the Cosmic Encounter has a variable power component that was featured in Dune, but I can't remember much about it, except the cool artwork and theme. /  3/27/10: picked up in trade w/Primordial Soup for Merchants of Venus + 6 General Magazines.

2014: I managed to set up and try a solo game of this to try to grock the rules again (and they are OBTUSE, let me tell you). It just wasn't happening for me. I gave the game to my nephew, who likes the movie, but I doubt he will ever take the trouble to learn them. He's a big Minecraft player, and that generation doesn't read emails, let alone figure out Dune.

2016: nephew gave copy back to me, never played it. Up for sale or trade.

Fun Factor: 10
Components: 7 (Components are what you would expect from a game released in 1979.)
Theme: 10 (If you are familiar with the books, then you know that this game is absolutely married to the theme.)
Mechanics: 6 (The rules are a total bust- very difficult to decipher and high mental cost of entry)
Theme + Mechanics: 9
Replay Value: 10
Scaling/Players: 5 (Poor. Really no good with less than four players.)
Subjective +0.25 (This game is possibly the most elegant multiplayer themed wargame ever designed. The amount of player interaction in this game is nothing short of amazing, very few games approach it with the "nexus" mechanic and treachery bidding, along with special powers.)  Edit: subjective rating reduced 0.25 because of problems of length and metagame tendencies.

Edit (1-1-2013): This game suffers some issues with the metagame.  When playing with money factions i.e. Emperor and Guild, if all the other players are not present the game suffers certain weaknesses.

Another nearly perfect game.  The theme of the game is so well supported by the mechanics that you will become fully immersed in the game...  Excellent with a full compliment of players, nearly useless when you have less than 4 players.  Not too short, not too long, this game is really deserving of a full review on my part.)

RATING: 5
Only played it once and that time one player threw the game because he just wanted too prove that a game where one player can hand the victory to another player if he decides to must be a sucky game. Well, that particular game definitely sucked. 

*Update* Just got to play this again. While I can see the game's charm and respect the design, I feel the problems outweigh the fun: the components are horribly dated, the playing time fluctuates wildly, the limited resources allows no sense of build up, just biding time like some scorpion (just hoping that it's not your own neck you're stinging when you decide to strike).

My #1 board game.  Is this actually a great game to be held up on a pedestal for all to see?  Probably not.  What it does offer is some of the most tense diplomacy and area control you can have in a game of this type.  It offers six very unique factions, very quick and easy to learn rules, and so much strategic depth, luck pushing, and bluffs that it truly surpasses most games in what it offers.

Dune is not just a game, it is a life event.  If you can get six people together for an indeterminate amount of time this can be one of the greatest uses of time ever devised.  

I may be partial because I have read and loved the books multiple times throughout my life, but somehow they captured the personality of the various factions in the mechanic of the game itself.  Harkonnen is vile and treacherous.  The Emperor is rich yet flawed, his power slowly fading throughout the game.  The Atreides are prescient, all-knowing and intimidating foes.  The Spacing Guild is controlling movement throughout the board and profiting off the conflict of others.  The Fremen are wandering native across the board, using the storm and worm to their advantage.  And all along, the Bene Gesserit are manipulating everything behind the scenes.  

The more the players know the game, the more the game melts away and you are in the world, an agent of Arrakis with your own motives and glory.  Trust your ally, but only so far.  Maneuver, entice your enemy to overextend, throw the battle to win the war.  Rarely has inspiration and creativity been given such free reign in a board game as here.

And when the game is over, blink and look around and return slowly to your normal life.  But not really.

Excellent game designed by EON; the people that designed Cosmic Encounter.  They altered the design and included some of the flavor of Dune. The game is almost a serious version of CE. Very deep strategies. The game, along with the 2 expansions is still produced by Eurogames. It is the best &#039;wargame&#039; around. The variety and depth are unmatched; there is combat, diplomacy, auctions, area control and variable victory conditions.  The systems all work well together.  It is a great game. Only drawback is that it requires 5 or 6 players for the best games and that increases the playing time significantly.

The theme of this game is really impressive. The design of the print and play version I had by Ilya Baranovsky is a sight to behold. The mechanics are so much smoother than it's child, Rex that it's not even funny. This game suffers a little bit from it's age. Lots of the battles wind up being harsher than they need to be thanks to betrayals. The economics are so tight that if you aren't a faction that gets money through the actions of the other factions, you can easily land yourself in an untenable situation. Battles are very costly, but the game gives you very little to do other than battle.

This game is so much player negotiation that despite it being a really cool game, it was completely incompatible with my group.

Well, one of the best games ever made, this game is a truly gem in my collection. Unlike much of other strategy games this one is normally done in a few hours (means: between 2 and 3). In my group it is normally played as a warm-up before we start on heavier stuff. I will just describe two fascinating features of the game, which are different compared to other games. First, all players play races with race-specific different strongs and weaknesses, means that every race is uniquely played (its even not like a credit point system, like race 1 is good in A and B but poor in C and race 2 is poor in A but good in B and C ... they are COMPLETELY different. The second feature is the quick altering of the game, meaning that in minutes the game can topple and a player, who was minutes before nearly out of play, could challenge to win the game.

Generally use a house rule requiring an extra location for victory when allied to another player.

Nagyon jónak tartom, de nem az eredeti szabályok szerint, hanem az évek alatt csiszolódott játékélményt növelő változtatásokkal. Kicsit agresszív és túl konfrontatív, de kell az interakció.
A leginteraktívabb és legtöbb diplomáciát igénylő játék. Ha belejövünk ebbe, akkor az egyik kedvencé is válhat. Komoly esély van rá.:)
Az évek nem hagytak rajta nyomot, mert még mindig jó és egyedi megoldásokkal operál. Érthető a helyezése a BGG-n. 
A szövetségek és a szereplők képességei lenyűgöző kombinációkat eredményezhetnek.

NOTE: This game is likely going to get an update to a '10'. I want to play it a few more time before I make my decision on this score. Every single time I walk away entirely pleased with the experience, reviewing what went right and wrong in my head, and how to do a better job next time. And, most importantly, wanting to play again as soon as possible.

Fantastic game. I never seem to be able to get this one to the table as much as I wish. There is so much going on in this game that I love - asymmetrical powers, auctions, alliances, hidden powers, multiple paths to victory..and I love the theme.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3.5
The game captures the feel of the novel better than any other alternate medium (movies, etc.).  At least it felt that way for a while.

This game is really not that good in my opinion.  The winning conditions are ludicrous and non-thematic.  The game is so fragile that if a players are merely playing to win, rather than role-play Dune, there's little reason for the game to last past the first Shai-hulud.

It's fairly easy for all the players that control strongholds to ally together on the first Shai-hulud and end the game as equal winners.

If you want to implement personal agendas like, "I want a solo win," or "I will only ally with the Fremen," then things can get interesting but the mechanisms aren't implemented make such actions conducive to winning.  

You can implement house rules, I suppose, to fix the game, otherwise it's as I said, more of a role playing experience than a game.

I'm usually bad at diplomacy-type games and therefore tend to dislike them (by a few points on the ratings) but Dune (this one) was a lot of fun. Even when I was losing, I had options that let me screw up the carefully-crafted plans of the people who had screwed up my carefully-crafted plans earlier.  In fact I had more fun doing that, than I did during the time I was doing ok.  Definitely want to play this one again! (Rating dropped by 0.5 after playing the Emperor, whose special power completely sucks compared to the others.)

RATING: 9
The rules set bounds for an incredible narrative that the players exist freely in.  Players are not playing against the game, but against each other's personalities augmented by their faction characteristics.  There is no other game which exhibits such freedom without becoming dominated by a strict rules set. True, the rules are a bit of a maze to navigate as each faction has many rules exceptions, but as the game progresses, these exceptions become obvious and expected.  This is the one of my favorite games that I have played this year and may possible become my favorite game of all time.  The theme, mechanics, and rules mesh together to make a truly spectacular game!  It is a must buy for anyone who has read the books, loves diplomatic games, and wants to make plans within plans within plans.

Currently making a homemade copy... tons of work and not cheap!

One of my first games. A reprint needed for this one, no doubt!!. I don't remember more fun than playing this title with a group of friends. It was released much before the Lynch's movie came out.

I've managed to get a few more plays in, and have played this a total of 4 times now, and loved it each time!  After my fourth play, I read through the giant tournament rules FAQ and saw that we were still doing one or two things wrong though!

Some people hate the way alliances work in this game, but to me that is one of the appeals.  Every game I have played so far as ended after an alliance was formed and has consisted of pretty epic battles in every fortress.

Complicated and long. Not sure it's my cup of tea, but my one play to date certainly generated some interesting situations and outcomes. It is a rich game, full of detail and theme. I'll try it again some day, although I won't mourn if it doesn't happen soon.

My favourite game.  I have a spare copy for when the first set wears out.  There are problems with the rules, and I don't like the expansions much, but the base game perfectly meshes playing the other players with playing a system.  This is not a game with a perfect plan, it is a game where plans reflect plans that reflect plans.  This is a wargame and is too complex to be an acceptable family strategy game.  At its best with 5 or 6 experienced players and a few house rules to ensure it plays in 2-4 hours.  It brilliantly solves the multi-player leader hitting problem by allowing alliances to win, and controlling when they can form and break.  It is asymmetric but balanced.  Undimmed by the Eurogame invasion, the game is actually fairly simple rules-wise and offers an unparalleled gaming experience.

Great game, play with 5 or 6 players, tho this will increase playing times.  Be sure you have read Dune, or most of the rules will make no sense.  Of the two sequel games, Duel is not worth the time or money, but I really like Spice Harvest.  You can play a game of Spice Harvest the day before, (since it sets up the board for the basic game) and then play the full game the next day.

RATING: 10
I give the game a 10 when 6 players are present.  Usually we have 3-5 players and it is indeed a great game.  2 players not so much.  That aside the player powers each has, the troop movement, so many ways to spend spice, how to decide who dies in battle.... That and more makes this a great classic!!  Must own, will never sell mine.  I never cared for the Dune theme much or the books/movies but the mechanics in this game are top notch!  Do not let the age of the game fool you!

One of the best board game, Dune is Queen and Starcraft is King of board games for me. 

Dune is great mechanism in great universe, Dune from Frank Herbert. Every game mechanism fit to Herbert books, everything from Herbert´s Dune books fit to this game.

There is many treachery, traitors, tactics, battles, harvest spice, alliances, everything you know from Dune. Who doesnt, come to know. 

Every Faction - Emperor, Atreides, Harkonnen, Fremen, Guild and Bene Gersserit - are different. Different strategy, different advantages, different way to win.

This game is not only about theme, there is great mechanism and also this game isn´t only about great mehanism, there is great theme, if not greatest ever. It make this game the best in theme category.

Who want play Dune, play this game. Rex is comming soon, but its not Dune and never be.

Spice must flow.

I consider Dune to be one of the all-time great games.  Quite simply, I have found no other game that provides the intensity of Dune:  the pressure is always on; every decision matters.  Despite the many different possible interpretations of the rules and the debates caused by them, the rules (once agreed upon) work well together and provide a highly thematic environment.  Although the game doesn't follow the books very well, it is rich in covering many details.  [2009-AUG-02]

I see some of the appeal of this game but it has some serious flaws (particularly the alliance system which makes four player essentially unworkable).

That sort of circumstance is unusual and I am not sure if I would choose this.

Aces all the way--this game&#039;s got it all.  Play with all the expansions for best results.  Only flaw is that bothersome infinte loop in the rules when Atreides/prescience, BG voice, and a Truthtrance Card all come into conjunction.  Fortunately, this is a rare occurence.

I like this game, it is the length (variable at that) that knocks the rating down for me.  Time needs to be set aside to play this one in case you do run into one of those long games.  Hence, by BGG's system, I need to be in the right mood to play it and would play it only sporadically.

That said, this does a decent job of capturing the books with shifting alliances (though can include some not imagined in the books...Atreides/Harkkonen) with a fog of combat element (leader choice) as well as the treachery element.  A great game to play at a con or gathering when the time is allotted.  Not one for a casual game night.

Fifteen years ago, I would've listed this as one of the best games around.  We played it all the time.  Like Cosmic Encounter, it's a seminal and influential game design.

I haven't played it in a decade and, even if it was part of my collection, I'm not sure it would see much play over the newer more-streamlined games I own.

On the other had, DUNE is a great multiplayer game where everyone is battling to reach a different goal.

And it fits the theme of the original book remarkably well.

--Jun2006-- (Slightly) better than _A Game of Thrones_, in my opinion.  And not much longer in practice.  I might give it a 9 if I could play it more often.  Sadly, I've not played for more than 15 years.
--Mar2007-- Whee!  A couple plays.  This one really needs 5 or 6; with less than the full complement it feels like it's missing some secret sauce.
--Jun2007-- On the other hand, with a full set of players (and the advanced rules, please) it's amazing.

This is a game of loopholes.

Big and complicated and full of the "Rule 8.12.9b" syndrome. We played it once, with the full contingent, and it was rough teaching ourselves from scratch. The game ended on turn 3 or so when the top 3 of 6 all allied together. We'll probably play it again some day, but for now it seems like a close companion of the Lynch movie: when you're in the mood for something weird and striking, but not necessarily what you would usually consider good.

Dune has to be the only book whose finest adaptation is a board game. Like the book it's based on, Dune is filled with hidden motives, shifting alliances, and unforeseen outcomes. As an interpretation of Frank Herbert's original novel, it is impeccable. As a board game experience, it is filled with opportunities for creative play and secret plans. Mechanically it plays a little like a heavily-themed "advanced" Cosmic Encounter, but in practice it feels very different. It's a six-player experience that is unmatched, and it's a great showcase of how well board games can embody the themes of famous novels.

Guild + Fremen + Atreides + Bene Gesserit won in round 4 ... after four hours. There's so much potential in this game. I'm sure every play is different and again and again awesome!

Would be a 10 if not for some meddlesome, never-resolved rules issues. Kind of long, too. Avalon Hill's poorly thought out optional and advanced rules can largely be jettisoned, though most are loathe to do so.  Don't like to play with free-wheeling bribery either, since it gets around most of the restrictions of the game.  All in all, a clean new edition with nailed-down rules would just about end my game design 'career'.

The 'million ways to play Dune' stemming from this being a relic of '70s game design and antiquated rules and rules-writing is a turn-off. Rex is more streamlined and clearer in every aspect, and even if it's off the mark in some places, at least it sticks to one principle.

But the natural evocation of the theme here just works.

Biggest difference is in movement and shipping, and I think this is more a case of preferring whichever system you learned first (Dune or Rex).

[u]Key Differences[/u]
 - More faction powers in Dune. Unfortunately, these are on the fiddly/powerful side: Atreides' Kwisatz Haderach, Harkonnen's Leader Capture, Guild's Maneuver Anytime. I favor keeping the additional Fremen powers. b{Advantage: Rex}b
 - Karama is too many abilities crammed onto a card. Better to have it streamlined into a Cosmic Zap or similarly pithy card (it's a Cosmic Zap with exceptions + faction-specific abilities + 2 generic abilities), which Rex did. b{Advantage: Rex}b
 - Maneuver/Shipping differences: Rex is more dynamic, while Dune = very restricted by whichever strongholds aren't still occupied, and the importance of movement discourages combat and losing the tokens that took a while to develop. b{Advantage: Rex}b
 - I welcome any structure on diplomacy/bribery besides free-for-all. The additional structure actually encourages people to make deals (instead of just relying on a person's word). OTOH, easily ported to Rex. r{Advantage: Dune}r
 - While leader-revivals in Dune make combat even scarier, I prefer leader death to mean something. r{Advantage: Dune}r
 - Winner takes all the spice from killed leaders in Dune while killing leaders gains influence in Rex. I favor the latter since the former results in more separation between winners and losers and makes combat scarier. b{Advantage: Rex}b
 - Increased revival rate in Rex makes combat less scary but also nerfs the Fremen. A wash since it's also needed to balance out Double Spice Blows without Advanced Combat, and get more combat into an 8-round game.
 - Treachery Deck in Dune encourages creativity with Truthtrance and combat with Worthless, while Strategy Deck in Rex provides flexibility with each card having 2 uses. r{Advantage: Dune}r

Overall, combat is less scary in Rex, which is welcome, because blind-bidding combat is already as scary as it can get. I'm concerned that combat in Dune is scary to the point of turtling.

A classic from childhood and still enjoyed periodically to this day.  And that's no Choam Charity.  OK, maybe it is biased.  I love Dune.  In fact one of my fave movies is David Lynch's Dune - a movie which many don't seem to appreciate.  So consider that a disclaimer, although I stand behind my 10 rating.

While this game has been an absolute blast to play, and I can hardly wait until I get to play it again, I have to give it this somewhat low rating due to the time involved in playing it.  If this were guaranteed to finish in under 2 hours, I would definitely bump this up a couple of spaces.  As for why I like the game: I love how well the game captures much of the feel of the Dune books.  As I was playing my first game, I started seeing the books in terms of gameplay.  This to me defines a game with lots of theme.  Add to this that it is loads of fun, and you cannot lose. [7]
--------------------------------------------
Not much has changed of my opinion since my original rating of this game.  The time to play is still something of an issue, that it affects the likelihood of the play more than the desire to play.  So I bumped the rating up just a bit.  It's really not quite an 8 but it is pretty close. [05/03/2009]

Avalon Hill did a wonderful job adapting the supremely complex world that Herbert conceived into a beautiful, playable game complete with spice and worms. If you loved the book or even just learned of Dune when Sting popularized the movie, you'll still enjoy this compelling game. It's best when played with four or more opponents, but be prepared for a lengthy endeavor; Dune takes many, many hours to complete. Some of that is due to the complexity of the rules, but our lengthiest games were always those with the most experienced gamers. If you have the time and enjoy fantasy war gaming set in space (i.e. Cosmic Encounter or Twilight Imperium) then I'd highly recommend Dune. For the casual gamer with little familiarity with Herbert's classic novel or with a low tolerability for complex, lengthy games this wouldn't be the best place to start.

[1 play] Roughly 5 hours of play, about half way to completion. This could obviously be a very, very long game.

Quick thumbnail sketch is a cross between Bermuda Triangle (the storm), Cosmic Encounter (the combat and alliances), and Diplomacy (the alliances, metagaming, etc.) - all dressed up nicely for those who like Herbert's world.

There are clever ideas here (the unique powers and unique victory conditions for each power are great)

Wow. What a game! Made in 1979, Dune has alot of mechanics and ideas that are way ahead of its time. Player abilities that interacts creatively, negotiation, an auction for special cards, combat that involves secret assigning of troops, leaders and special cards. Amazing.

The object of the game betrays AH's wargaming roots: capture 3 of 5 strongholds. But the turn order is fairly brisk and streamlines (players can only place units in 1 location and only move 1 set of troops). This makes decisions agonising and tense. Battles are also tense affairs and one must be careful as to when and whom to attack. The negotiation and alliance aspect has touches of Diplomacy and Cosmic Encounter.

The ruleset and variety of card and player effects leaves room for debate and our group saw some vaguely nasty disagreements at times.

I'm in the minority in thinking Dune plays just fine with 4 or 5 (but 6 is certainly preferrable).  Also, usually we play just the basic rules and disallow alliances; many rule ambiguities evaporate and there isn't as much bickering.  The game provides a great deal of tension and rewards long term planning.  Victory is truly sweet!  It was our favorite as teenagers (now we just don't have the time).

[b]Best 6 Player Game Award[/b]

Fantastic game. I've played the reimagination, Rex, more than I've played this, but I feel that the games are similar enough that I have a good idea of how the system works. 

As for Rex VS Dune, my impression so far is that it feels like the same game but it's not, and that Dune simply has more stuff -- more powers, more cards, more strategies. Which appeals to my gaming tastes, so I'm rating this higher, though Rex seems to be successful in its goal of streamlining the components and rules -- especially the rules, which are all over the place with Dune (seems like no group plays the same way!)

First impression preferences:

*I like the "more stuff" factor in Dune.

*I like the shipping rules in Rex and the super-mobility. However, I also like the increased emphasis on movement in Dune. So I appreciate them differently.

*Worthless cards are pretty damn fun for Atreides and Bene Gesserit, annoyance for everyone else. Karama is cool.

*I think I like money gains for anyone who kills a leader in Rex, not just the winner. Dune battle losses are already harsher than Rex in multiple ways -- so it seems unnecessary to me to punish a losing player even further by letting the winner collect spice from his OWN leader!

*Rex is prettier and has some extra components that help and stand out more (the Sol fleet is much easier to spot than Storm, Bene/Xxxcha get tokens for their predictions, etc) and the map is easier for me to read; but there are some clean looking Dune redesigns out there

(5 Design + 5 Enjoyment)

So much has been said already.  The advantage to the Decartes version is that the expantion cards (which should be played) have the same color backing (The AH cards are different color backing and give away what you have).  Disadvantage is that it is in french and the board looks color copied.  Still get it while you can.  A perfect game.

I recently played Dune again for the first time in probably 15 years. I was pleasantly surprised to find that it holds up well to my distant memories. It's a great balance between simple core rules and complex special powers. I won't give it a 10 at the moment because it's only perfect with six players and it does raise a surprising number of questions for such a short rule book. Plus it can run a bit long.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Has so many fantastic factors that all fit together in way that is just plain rip-roarin, memory-makin fun. To name just a few of the awesome moving parts:

blind bidding for treachery cards - some are completely useless, but your opponents dont know if you got a "trip to Gamont" crap card or if you've received a useful poison weapon or lasegun. The Harkonen player excells here, as he has cornered the market on Treachery. But, all payment for these cards goes straight to the Emperor player. 

The best variable player powers you will ever see in any game - like the clairvoyant Atreides being able to see part of your battle plan, or the Bene Gesseret and her "voice" that makes you do things against your will; or the Fremen's uncanny knowledge of the storms and Worm.

Speaking of Worms - they pop up when you don't want them to, and can devour entire legions of your troops, unless of course, you are the Fremen character and can ride them to any sand space on the board...

There are both troop movements on the board, and troop shipment onto the planet from off-world. The latter is costly, and paid to the Spacing Guild player. The Emporer player must at start ship all of his troops from off-world, but he has so much money he can afford it. 

Turn order is cyclical, but the starting player is determined by a storm that forever circles around the border of the board, destroying the best laid plans as it rages from one sector to the next.

Area control is important, as one must claim strongholds to win - not an easy task.

And lets not forget all the glorious battles - so much edge of your seat fun here, and with no dice rolling at all - just an elegant, easy to learn system involving choosing your leader, sacrificing as many troops as you can afford to, and picking attacks and defenses. So, so good. 

Spice is the currency of the game, and most players will have to fight for it. 

Honestly, once the players all understand their special powers and the mechanics of the game, it plays out like a symphony. Only drawback is that it must be played with at least 4 - the more the better.

If you can get the players and the time, this is one of the most fun games out there. It's highly interactive, with cooperation, negotiation, and the most tense combat system of any board game.

A wargame with political intrigue and treachery, it perfectly captures the spirit of the novel. for best results you need six players and for those six to have some enthusiasm for the source material.

It moves a bit slowly, but is heavily themed and can be a lot of fun.  I recommend starting without the optional rules, just because it can be a lot to remember all the exceptions.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
My six rating is an uneasy compromise between my great admiration for the design and my disinclination to actually play it. Dune is variable player powers done right, alliances done right: every character feels very different, and powers are so complementary that different alliances are valuable at different times. Everything ties together very neatly.

The key is that you need the right group -- people have to play to win and they have to be happy to break alliances to do so. Helping your current allies can be dangerous because they may not be allies for long. You can't trust anyone.

You can see the way the game is *supposed* to work: it's possible for a victory on any turn, so players should be on edge the whole time, working to ensure that they're part of the alliance that takes it (or the one that snatches sole control). You just need a bunch of scheming, backstabbing little Machiavellis. 

When it doesn't work, it's a tedious, 4+ hour back-and-forth. I'm not sure I want to take that risk.

I LOVE this game.  The only down side is it can have balance issues depending upon how many are playing and which factions they are playing.  A great political intrigue/light war game that has the best combat mechanics I have ever seen in a game.  It also faithfully adheres to the books and even cleverly incorporates advanced rules that fit the houses perfectly.  It amazes me they were able to put all this together in such a pleasing and well-balanced package.  Although this game can be a little pricey and hard to find, it is worth it.  If you have read the books and this game looks at all interesting to you, then you MUST play it.  The only catch is you really need at least 4 players for this game to shine.  It's best with all 6 though.

[1 play] Initial reaction rating.  I played a six player game.  It ended very suddenly and quickly in second turn.  A worm surfaced, alliances were formed, one alliance held enough strongholds to win, game over.  I felt a bit odd, I would not mind trying a more "complete game" to get a better feel for it.  It was an interesting game to learn and play, I had a good time with it.  I saw people playing it again later and their game too a long long time.  I am not sure I like how the alliances determine the outcome so much in this game.  I prefer games where I feel a little more in control of my own destiny I think.

RATING: 7
I am shocked at how well-loved this game is...I owned it along with basically every other AH box release in the late 70s/early 80s, and played it some.  The game is fun, with lots going on, and the flavor is definitely there.  But I remember the victory conditions slanting so that you pretty much had victory determined by the alliances that got made, with one big battle in the Imperial Basin or with Family Atomics and a storm clinching the 3rd stronghold for the winners.

Very true to the source, but never really grabbed me as a game.

UPDATE:  OK, played this game for the first time in 15+ years the other day.  It was a lot of fun.  I think we used to play with 4/6 (including the Shield Wall) needed for the win and no increase for alliances.  The group I played with used what I believe is a pretty common optional rule where you need 3/5 as a solo winner, 4/5 as two-player alliance, and 5 for any larger group.

I still think the combat tends to be a bit punitive for larger stacks, but I was quite impressed.

6 player game. Long, felt pretty static. First 7 or 8 rounds had spice rather than worms, so no alliances. Finally a worm shows up so we split into 3 vs 3 deathmatch alliances. One player has to leave. We fight on. The final battle is a tie, wiping both armies off the map so the round ends 2 strongholds each, and play should continue, but we called it a draw before some of the hungrier players passed out. Tips for next time I play: remember to bring a packed lunch.

Captures the feel of the books extremely well. The actual gameplay is average though, and there are a lot of weird rules that take time to get the hang of (e.g. having orthocopters also means you can harvest 3 spice instead of 2 per person). Each person is very distinctly different, but still fairly balanced in play. Also, the bluffing and hidden aspect of combat is very fun and I wish more games incorporated it.

I also own and made a hand-crafted version designed by Illya.  It's beautiful. It's a shame that his version hasn't been licensed for a commercial reprint.  I'm a big fan of the Dune novels, but, perhaps, this game is for Dune fans only? I don't see how you can truly appreciate the game's perfect match of theme to its gaming mechanics without having knowledge about the world of Dune?  The game design is pure genius.  My only negative thoughts about it is the fact that it's difficult to get six players together as was intended for optimal game play.

The rate would be higher if the game was shorter (120 minutes? Much longer than that!). 15 rounds is a lot, even with no optional or advanced rules. The game itself is great and fun, especially if the group likes the Dune theme, as I do.

Sold off my Descartes copy as my friend has made a brilliant homemade copy so if we play a copy it'll be his. That being said, I'd love to have such a copy in my collection so when he makes another I'll be the first one to buy it of his hands!

RATING: 6
There are certainly some interesting things going on in this game and the combat is a nice little bluffing game but somehow it all left me feeling a little cold. Perhaps it was the easy alliance that led to an early and mostly uncontested victory. I'm not really sure why I didn't enjoy it more than I thought I would. Perhaps it just didn't match what I expected the game to be; the spice mining/collection seemed to be an afterthought for most of the players and the luck of getting useful treachery cards seemed pretty key.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It can take a while, but the player immersion is there, and it feels like Dune.  In desperate need of a component upgrade and a reprint.  I'd like to play it a few more times because I feel the ranking will move up with more play.  (We played basic rules)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
A classic, one of the best board games ever. Diplomacy, conflict and treachery mixed with great thematic background that drives the rules. All the Cayluses, Goas and another "trendy for half a year" games are not worthy enough to lick Dune's crack.

RATING: 2
An experience of misery for 4 hours (6-player game) with vague and convoluted rules, unbalanced economic rules that encourage turtling.  The game has serious flow and mechanics problems.

The sad part is that I really wanted to like this game as it has some neat elements to reflect the books/movie.  I like the asymmetrical faction abilities and start, the sand storm, Treachery and Traitor cards, the Spice Blow.  The "chrome" is enjoyable, but the core game mechanics are frustrating.  It's hard to build and conquer something.

Summary: nice idea, poor design and execution.

This is a really impressive design that, despite being 40 years old, has not aged a day.  This shouldn't be surprising considering it comes from the design team of Cosmic Encounter.  The integration of theme and mechanics is top shelf, especially if you're familiar with the source material.

Still, this is a difficult game for me to rate because I've only played it once and it's definitely one that would blossom with experience.  The rules themselves are quite simple, so learning to play the game is easy; the nuanced and substantial differences between factions, however, make learning to play the game WELL is a challenge.  Once I get a better handle of it, and play some sessions with people who are all experienced, I can see this one becoming a top 10 game for me.

We played this game for it's cool factor a number of times.  We liked the special powers.  We liked the negotiating.  But we failed to notice that nobody could win -- we would either end by somebody noticing that another player had made a big mistake (once) or by giving up (a couple of times).  I think this game has a lot of neatness factor but I can't see playing it again.  Also, in our group, the game seemed to bring out bitterness and unhappiness in people, even as they raved over how much they liked it.

Theme and stragety ooze from every pore of this gameplay experience. Since playing the game with more than 3 players, I've bumped up the rating by .5, it definitely deserves it. The only thing stopping it from reaching that perfect 10 is the dated graphics and components in the box. Sure, this is readily fixed with downloaded maps and counters, but I am rating the game as it is in the box. Full review at: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/303598

If you have six people willing to play a long game, this is the game for you.    The wild variable playing time is a negative for me, but it can be squeezed in in 4 hours if everyone knows what they are doing and conscience of playing quickly, but runs the risk of lasting 20 minutes with a quick sneak attack.  It really feels quite free form, unlike other game systems I frequently enjoy.  Crazy interactions once the alliances form.  Really well balanced.  Minimal downtime for such a long game. 

The rulebook ambiguities are brutal in this game.....  A better rulebook would probably bump this game up to a 10.

After loving the original book, enjoying the next five in the series, and disliking the recent prequels, Dune was one of the games at the top of my wishlist for a very long time.  I was finally able to trade for a copy of the Descartes edition, and am now very eager to get this to the table to try it out.  I really like Diplomacy and Game of Thrones, so I'm hoping that the negotiations and variable player powers of this one are as good as I've been hoping.

One play. Not a good play - it took more time to teach the game then to play it. Once it started, two alliances were made - one with three players, other with two (one of the players stayed out of both). It took around 45 minutes for the alliance with three players to attack the alliance with two, in order to take the last city they needed. It was a lost battle for the alliance with two, since the other one had a much bigger army (since, with one more player, they could afford leave little behind). But they wanted to crush and used the strongest General they had - and he was a double agent. So the alliance of two won the battle and crushed the army. The game was over after this - the alliance of two won.

Though the end was great (because of the major swing of sure-thing battle), overall I wasn't impressed at all. The possibility of an alliance that can lead everyone on it to victory is a bad thing.

After this I learned that there are some variants that make the alliance thing do not happen. But I have yet to play like this (since I don't own the game), so I will keep the average rating.

Played this once. While there weren't tons of rules, since we were learning from the rulebook and there's not much help on the player aids, we were fumbling around a bit. The endgame in our 4-player game was pretty wonky, where we suddenly turned it into a 2v2 team game. I'm guessing there's a different dynamic with more players and more experienced players.

There is a reason this is considered a classic - it has one of the best intertwinings of theme and mechanics I've ever experienced in a game. So many times, legendary games from the past can disappoint when compared to more recent, evolved games, but Dune seemed so ahead of everything it feels like eurogames are just catching up to its elegance and intricacy. Only one play, but one of the best gaming experiences I've ever had. It's a pity that the reprint won't include the Dune theme as it is the driver behind many of the mechanics.

It pains me to rate this so low, as I usually love this type of game, and when I researched this, I thought it sounded like an older version of [gameid=6472].  I was wrong.  It's an incredible mess.  Dune does theme well, so well that I would say it's the best conversion of ANY theme to a boardgame, whether book, movie, or imaginary universe.  However, it gets more things wrong than it does right.  Components are ugly, units are thrown away frivolously and yet absurdly limited, and the treachery cards are both crucially important and too random.  DON'T try the advanced rules until you are familiar with the basic rules, or at least have a player in your group who is well-versed in the intricacies of the basic rules.

There's an absolutely critical failure of Dune, though, which is bad enough to get its own paragraph.  The alliance system is a [u]horrendously[/u] misimplemented mess.  As written, it's a fun-spoiler of magnificent proportions.  There's no reason not to gang up with the two or three or even four other strongest players on the board when the first worm comes up.  Then, it is child's play to secure the three strongholds needed for victory between several players.  What's the point of playing if four of the six players are able to claim victory together?  To make it worse, a single-player victory is nigh impossible if players are keeping their eyes open.  If nobody forms alliances, the game devolves into pile on the leader.  You can house-rule the alliance system down into merely unfun territory. but it smacks of underdeveloped, overly group-dependent laziness.

I want components from the PnP remakes of the game  ([geekurl=/thread/531160/scotts-dune-build-project]Scott[/geekurl], [geekurl=/filepage/61499/ilya-77-dune-components]Ilya[/geekURL]). Although I see it as a project for myself, I don't know how I'd make the board. Apparently you buy a cheap board for another game and paste on the dune printouts.

I would prefer the Ilya board, but I don't know where to find the board image.
[ImageID=974607]
It does not seem to be listed in [geekurl=/filepage/61499/ilya-77-dune-components]Ilya's component list[/geekURL]

I could use the [gameid=104363] rules to streamline the game from a 6-hour experience to a 3-hour experience.

RATING: 8
I've only gotten to play this legendary game a couple of times. I have to say, I came away with some mixed emotions. Most of the game is surprisingly simplistic, looking at the gameboard and reading about it here on the geek I expected it to be a lot harder to learn than it actually was. (That's a good thing!)

I love the asymmetric sides and the way that all of the different factions mess with the board, each in their own unique way. This design does the best job of capturing a theme that I've ever seen. For instance, check out how the Bene Gesserit faction works (summary from wikipedia): [b]The Bene Gesserit player may "coexist" with other players' units without causing a confrontation, and may command other players to use or not to use certain cards during combat (representing their use of "the Voice"). At the beginning of the game the Bene Gesserit player secretly records the name of another player and the turn at which they think that other player will win the game. If the Bene Gesserit correctly guesses who will win and when, they win the game instead.[/b]

Is that the most thematic special ability ever? Yes, yes it is.

As for what holds this back from a truly stellar rating, the rules assume a certain amount of self-policing by the player's to protect the experience. Modern gamers have unfortunately been somewhat trained to look for and exploit loopholes, which can make the game break down a bit. The rules allow alliances to share both powers and a win, so technically a player can join an alliance just before the game ends and provide a victory point to someone else who has a big lead get a share of victory they clearly didn't deserve. Worse, they can form one at the very beginning of the game and never even consider betraying the alliance because there is little reason to do so. This can be a problem because some of the faction special abilities can be pretty game-breaking when combined with the special abilities of another allied faction, which in turn can lead to a very lopsided game from the outset, particularly if players align quickly and the rest of the table doesn't react to it.

Another thing that can sink the game before it starts is that it relies rather heavily on players leveraging turn order to force later acting players to absorb the resource and action cost of preventing game end. While strictly speaking this isn't quite the same as the "everybody loses" mechanic found in a lot of competitive co-op games, it functionally can end up that way if a player being leveraged decides to just not participate, as a counter-threat. That may just be a natural part of negotiation games n general, I'm not sure...but I do know that if the players are overly sensitive to economic bullying or quick to sabotage the game, it falls apart very quickly.

At any rate, the game requires selfish play and everyone at the table to be attempting to hold each other back at all costs, or it will end before it even starts. Dune is one of those weird games that almost guarantees a terrible experience on your first couple of plays, but if you stick with it and can find a group that is psychologically wired to do what the game asks them to do, then it is easily one of the most enjoyable and thematic licensed games out there.

RATING: 9
The Dune world comes to life with all its attendant tension and paranoia.  Thematic immersion is the game's strong suit.  Political alliances and treachery create a thick top layer of tension and a haze of uncertainty veils plans within plans.  Asymmetric wealth, mobility, troops, etc, to start, but can be offset by alliances, weapons, defences, weather, spice blows, etc. The game is as good as remembered from years ago, but only with the full complement of six players.  Games have an epic feel and narrative.  Excellent experience.  Unfortunately, uncertain length of the game (it varies from 1-6 hours) and needing six players makes it only an occasional experience.

The game experience lived up to memories of games played long ago, but the original components did not.  The Treachery cards in the Avalon Hill versions lack any verbiage and require the use of a reference sheet.  Found that annoying enough to make replacement cards using Ilya's files.  Again using Ilya's files, the map and faction shields were soon replaced as well.  Only the battle wheels and leader discs are from the original game.

Brilliant and so thematic. All those clever systems and special powers make for an always intriguing game. Unfortunately, it needs 6 players, and it's best if all of them are really into the theme, and are all gamers. So I will basically never play this again. :(

The rules are way too fussy as well, greatly reducing the ease of play. This is screaming for a reprint, with some tidying up and (mild) streamlining. And no, Rex (the TI3-universe Dune "clone") doesn't count.

Rating based on one play at the Gathering of Strangers in SLC.  Appears to be a multi-player wargame that has some of the issues of that genre; kingmaking, the potential for unbalanced alliances.  Has great Dune flavor, with each of the houses having highly thematic, interesting abilities.  The game ended prematurely with myself and another taking three areas (5 player game)... Or at least it felt premature.  Of the numerous house rules, many people pick +1 city for every member of the alliance, but I can see where this would extend the game dramatically.  Having to get 3 was hard enough, and occurred because of a lucky low-odds attack.  Getting 4 would have been impossible.  Limiting alliances to 2 players?  Probably not necessary since good groups will not do lame alliance stuff anyway.  Hmmm.  I probably need to play this more....

A very good, but long, war/interaction/diplomacy game.  It is an enjoyable social event, but a fair bit too long by today's standards.  I'd probably rather play Antike, Imperial, and Gheos than play one game of Dune, but it is still a good game to have in the collection for that periodic "manly games day."  I can't see playing with either of the expansions.  They seem to add nothing but length to an already lengthy game.

I chose to sell this one, assuming that the FFG reprint will be a bit better (or at least, much nicer looking) when it comes out.

Strategy conflict where players represent the main factions of Dune. Special powers of the factions lends itself towards heavy negotiation and alliances. The combat system uses has a card bidding mechanic similar to cosmic encounter which also lends itself to a bluffing and negotiating environment. This is a must-play game for anyone who considers themselves serious Dune fans that feed on diplomatic interaction.

Purchased as a high school gamer - and avid fan of the books - in 1982 or 1983.*

[i]Dune[/i] holds the record for the game that I have owned the longest without playing. A few weeks after bringing it home, I set it up solo and pushed some pieces around - but that was as far as I got.

I love 2-player wargames, even long ones, but I've since learned to avoid long multiplayer wargames.  There's too much diplomacy and downtime for my tastes, which is why 2-player games are so appealing.

So [i]Dune[/i] is one skeleton that may sit in my closet forever.


*I haven't cracked one of the novels in 25 years, so I have no idea if they still hold up.

This is a truly wonderful game that my friends and I are trying to play on a quarterly basis. [We now know that anything can happen, ever since the Harkkonens pulled off a surprise 3rd Turn victory. Positive outcome: we just started up another game that went the full 15 rounds.] The first time we played this, the game was a blood bath. Now, we are more timid, waiting for just that right moment to strike. Which is almost always a mini-bloodbath.

An excellent game, but my enthusiasm is wanning slightly. We tried playing with the troops cost spice to fight fully rule, but I am not interested in this variation any more.

[b][i]A beginning is a very delicate time. Know then, that is is the year 10191. The known universe is ruled by the Padishah Emperor Shaddam the Fourth, my father. In this time, the most precious substance in the universe is the spice Melange. The spice extends life. The spice expands consciousness. The spice is vital to space travel. The Spacing Guild and its navigators, who the spice has mutated over 4000 years, use the orange spice gas, which gives them the ability to fold space. That is, travel to any part of the universe without moving. Oh, yes. I forgot to tell you. The spice exists on only one planet in the entire universe. A desolate, dry planet with vast deserts. Hidden away within the rocks of these deserts are a people known as the Fremen, who have long held a prophecy that a man would come, a messiah, who would lead them to true freedom. The planet is Arrakis, also known as Dune. [/b][/i]


[i]I own the Shai-Hulud box art edition, for those that give a damn about these things.[/i]

We've only ever played with six players, so I'm not sure how well the game scales.

[i]You will need to house rule this game![/i]

[b]Recommendations:[/b]

A. Only play using Scott Everts' fantastic (Artscow printed) redesigned decks and map.

B. No expansions.

C. No advanced or optional rules from the [i]General[/i].

D. Do not allow more than 2 players to form an alliance together.

E. Change the victory conditions:
To win you need N+2 strongholds (whereby N is the number of players in an alliance).


I should plead for CHOAM charity: this game cost me a small fortune to assemble, even AFTER winning the game in an eBay auction for no small sum. So here's the inventory of extras I assembled for the ultimate Dune experience:
1. The actual game = £45
2. Replacement, custom made Artscow decks for the Treachery, Spice, Bene Gesserit, and Traitor decks = £30
3. Replacement, custom made, clearer and larger, Dune map from China (Artscow again) = £20
4. Mounting said map on a large, tough board = £23
5. Printing off a decent player aid = £0
6. Buying 10 packets of plastic discs to replace the card tokens = £20
7. Spray painting 2 lots of discs to colour match the leaders (spray cans cost you know!) = £5
8. Buying a big bag of blue gems to represent the Spice Melange = £10

Total = £153!

All that's left, is to buy or assemble a life size sandworm, and fit all my players with blue contacts, methinks.

A thematically rich game made even better if you are a fan of the Dune universe.  I really like the special powers for each of the six factions, as well as the benefits they confer to their allies.  Not very impressed by the standard win condition though, except for the Bene Gesserit.  I was more intrigued by the optional victories.

I also didn't care for the fact that some factions have easier access to spices than others.  There is no worse feeling than having very little army presence on board while being broke at the same time.  The game become quite boring and no one would really want to ally with you.  Not a fan of the combat either.  The whole thing with the committing tokens to using weapon/shield to betrayal just seemed very stilted.

I'm glad to have tried it, but it's definitely not the kind of games I enjoy playing.

A great game for cutthroat gamers.  The rules are a bit arduous to get through, especially the first two games or so, but once you have the rules and flow of the game down, it's the most evil game ever created.  Winning requires a great act of opportunism, cunning and treachery.  Be careful not to lose friends by playing this game.

Editor's note:  Got a few plays under my belt and raised my rating to a 9.  This game is fantastic.  Gamers out there that also enjoy poker will love this game, as it involves reading people.  The strategic differences between all of the factions are great.  I don't know how they work, but they do.

After 1 Play: My first play got cut short, so I'm really looking to try it again. I am a little wary of the length though, because if the game goes the full 15 turns I'd be pretty bored by the end.

After 2+ Plays: My biggest complaint is that there seems to be about a billion different combinations of opinional rules, so I'm never clear on exactly what set is in effect.  Outside of that, the variable length precludes me from play this a lot, but I could see playing once or twice a year as a special event.

3/15/07 - I'll be playing my 7th game of Dune tomorrow night, and I'm as giddy as a prom queen before the "big night".  Dune is the most ingenious, fun, thematic and brilliant game I've encountered.  I love it dearly.  And, for the record, it plays excellently with 4-6.  Don't listen to those liars who say 6 is the only option - they're liars.  You also need not have read Dune to appreciate the game, but doing so will only widen your appreciation for its ingeniousness
----
I don't really know what to say about Dune at this point.  I've played it three times and it seems to be haunting my every waking thought.  If I could somehow be paid on par with my desire to play this game again I would instantly have all of the money in the universe.

Severely underrated. Should be higher if published under another title to distinguish it from "Settlers of Catan".  The best of the Catan spinoffs.
Modified: should be the best of all Catan games!

Shake your rocket until two balls drop. Yes, it's that phallic. Still, a decent light Catan game that doesn't get played as often as it should in my gaming circle. September 2012: this is the first game I've ever traded for. Goodbye, Alien Frontiers - Hello, Starfarers.

The encounters give the game a nice twist. But was heavily disappointed by the fixed board (as it reduces re-playability, which is one of Catan's strong points). Oh, and the oversized rockets look silly..

RATING: 7
A very nice Catan game that adds some interesting elements and fun to the game.  A good switch-up type of game.  The ship however needs to be fixed, the poor thing just doesn't hold up to pressure... or use.  Good game though, I really enjoy it.

RATING: 5
2 plays / 5,6 players (with expansion)

LIKE: Space theme is nice. Good tech progression. Fun to explore. Amazing production pieces.
DISLIKE: Long, and game drags out (Limit trades to 1 minute). Encounters and production are very random. Players in last place will limp along, because usually poor production leads to a poor game, and resources are needed throughout.

OVERALL: This game would be much better with 4 or less players. With 6 we had a 5 hour game and the players in last place knew there was nothing they could do to catch up, so the game dragged out and was unbearably long. Limiting trades to 1 minute helps a little.

Ugh, nowhere near as nice as it's older brothers. You have to study the token mix to figure out which planets are likely to have good numbers, events happen too often, and if one player gets the traveller card early you may as well pack up and go home.

Didn't really care for it; however, I was the only one in the group that felt that way. The rocketships were breaking left and right, and I think that that mechanic in itself is stupid, but a lot of people seem to like it.

Big game with some of the most amazing components I will ever see in a game.  The play is pretty thematic for a Euro, and it doesn't bog down the flow of the game.  The play is smooth, but rather long.  It takes about 3X as long as [b]Settlers[/b].  It was a good time throughout, but will probably be a once-in-a-while thing for me.

Played only once so far. The production is impressive and the most relevant variation over plain Settlers, the exploring and adventure part, is fun although it slow down the game. 
I liked it but also tried almost at the same time the news Settlers in America and found it similar but a better game.

An interesting play that needs another round.  I did find that some of the event cards were a bit too powerful at the begining of the game ("space warp"), and the broken booster clip thing will keep me from getting this one until it is fixed...I picked up the new set and it does have some playability (the bits are WONDERFUL).  The new clips work great, it's just too bad they didn't bother to make them the same color...

It's a Settlers game with a lot of complexity piled on top. The event cards and the spaceships are a blast. The rest of the game is about as good as Settlers.

good game, as most if not all the Catan variants. Had a significant problem with the clips on the rocket ships (to hold the boosters)breaking off. They sent out a couple more ships to replace them.

This was actually the first boardgame I bought. Previously I'd only played Settlers and wanted something different to bring to my gaming group. IMHO it's a superior game to Settlers, although some people have a problem with spacejump cards. My only quibble was with the booster clips on the motherships which break if you actually put boosters in them, but Kosmos came up with a retrofitted ring that slips over the ship and fixes the problem. You can get the rings from Kosmos or Mayfair.

RATING: 4
There is more then 1 way to win this game and it can be really fun to play at times but it feels a bit drawn out. There's a 50% chance of an encounter each turn and that gets boring fast. The game is very luck dependent and the board is quite big for this type of game. A plus for the components, the mother ships are impressive although fragile.

I haven't played the game yet, and when I bought it, the cards were of the wrong constituency.  But when I called mayfair games about the problem, they did such an amazing job making up my missing parts and sending them to me right away, that I'm going to start off rating this as a "9".  I'll change my rating after I've played, but I'm going to add "1" to the rating due to the excellent customer service.

I like this game a bit more than settlers.  Many of the elements from the settlers expansions can bee seen in this game but the game does not seem to bog down quite the same way settlers can (especially when playing with Cities and Knights).  The exploration can slow things down a bit but in general I like the pieces, the play, and the interaction much more than settlers.

Disclaimer: I think I may have been brainwashed to dislike Catan-like games. While the game components are fantastic, I can't see myself wanting to play this very often. Much too random for my tastes (crazy rolls or an early space jump can swing the game too much). I'd consider this a step up from Monopoly for the non-gaming crowd but for me, it's more of a novelty item I'd take out once a year to show off the cool space ships.

This game comes with toy starships and looks great on a table surface!  However, the actual game play has been consistently slow taking off.  I've come up with some variations that I feel speed up the game.  Even though this game takes longer to play, I much prefer it to Settlers of Catan.

Love empire-building games and love a science-fiction/space theme, so obviously this one would appeal to me.  Only marked down by a couple of points as most of my friends don't seem to "get" it, the plastic motherships have bits that easily snap off (mine are almost completely broken now, but still playable) and it pales a little in the shadow of Twilight Imperium!

Highly entertaining Catan spinoff in outer space.  Upgrade your ships, set up trade agreements, and take a "strong stance against piracy"!  My friends and I always seem to have a blast playing this, and the inevitable role-playing that always ensues.  Surprisingly strategic given the randomness factor with regards to the planets, with a good mix of probability/risk/interaction/awareness of other strategies all needed to win.  The pieces do break down easily after time, unfortunately.  My copy has been ground down from overuse through time that I probably need to throw it out at this point.

This game is well worn but still quite playable!  All the parts and pieces are there except for one freight ring.  It's certainly playable without the freight ring.  You may not even get to that point in the game.  In addition, the box has a rip in one corner.  Unfortunately this game had a design flaw in the clasps for the boosters on the mother ships.  Not all the booster clasps are broken on my mother ships but most of them are.  This is negated by the additional booster holder rings that I recently received from Mayfair Games.  As of 12/1/12: I have it for sale on EBAY.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Production problems associated with the freight rings and booster clips mar an otherwise good game.  Unfortunately, for everything that Starfarers adds that improves the Catan system, it simultaneously adds its own problems.

The good:  Teuber opens up the strategic possibilities which makes for a better game compared to Settler's narrow focus.  The reserve system abrogates some of the sting of random resource generation and speeds up would could be an even longer game.  Finally, some fun and flavor is added through the Encounter deck.

The bad:  Despite multiplying the various paths to victory, Teuber still didn't balance the resources adequately.  Fuel reigns supreme no matter which strategy you pursue.  The reserve card ameliorates this somewhat, yet it brings its own problems.  It reduces the need to trade and creates an awkward circumstance where people lounge around at 9 points in order to continue to receive a free resource.  Finally, the Encounter deck can randomly hose people; not something to look forward to in a game that routinely approaches 2 hours in length, a length that Starfarers doesn't shoulder very well.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I got this during my "I love Catan" phase. It plays much better than Settlers — you can't get blocked and choked off from expansion. After playing the expansion a few times I came to the realization, I don't particularly like games that rely heavily on luck — which is what almost entirely drives both Catan games. Starfarers does have some *really* nice bits though.

I've given up on this one. Probably won't play ever again. Good parts: Cool components. Vaguely related to Settlers. Bad parts: Cool parts are very expensive.

RATING: 5.5
Not enough control.  In addition to the randomness of production (like other Catan games), luck predominates for ship movement, exploration & event deck.  Sadly, the event cards (which play out like a "choose-your-own-adventure" novel) become fairly predictible midway through the game (ex. pirates try to steal your resources, if you chase them, you usually compare your ship speed with an opponent).  Poor production -- don't try to attach the yellow boosters to the sides of your ship... you are guaranteed to break most of the tabs.

This is easily my favorite of the Catan series of games, but I'm not a big fan of the other titles.  'Starfarers' is just more fun, with a much more appealing theme (to me) and over-the-top production.  My plays of this proceed at a brisk pace, especially compared to 'Cities & Knights' or even vanilla Settlers.

The encounter cards can decide who gets the upper hand in this game. Space jump with a trade ship and then Galactic Relief Fund is IMO too powerful. Of course the winner usually  gets 4-5 VP on the last round, it's seldom the leading player on the last round who wins. I like the idea with the motherships.

Come late to this one - probably the 'catan' line was a put off as I really don't like Settlers much.

This is rather different and vastly superior. The theme fits well, the components are top notch and (so far) has good replayability, expansion helps adding more planets.

We play that everyone can build if on player builds which  speeds things up a bit, and you can ignore an encounter if the black is the 2nd ball (again speeds up the game).

Not as much trading as settlers - but that's okay, trading part slows the game down.

Very nice to look at, lots of things to do, but also seems very long.  I think our 6-player game came to 2.5 or 3 hours.  Later played with 3 players; much quicker game.  Due to game length, this is a 6.  With 3 players, it would be a little higher.

RATING: 8
One of the best Catan variants. I really like how you can upgrade your ship, which turns this into much more of an "engine builder" than the other Catans, since you get faster and more powerful as the game progresses. The tension really ratchets up as players race to colonize, and the exploration mechanic (taken from Seafarers) combined with the "combat" mechanism makes this feel more like an Ameritrash hybrid than a straight Euro.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fun variation on the Catan mechanics.  Encounters can be frustrating when one person gets all traders and you get all pirates, but there are ways to deal with it (i.e., making sure your mothership guns are on par with everyone else).  Like it as a break from Settlers.  Toy factor is huge!

I <b>really</b> like this game. Although I've rated it lower than the standard Catan... this is the game we pull out consistently when wanting the Catan experience. I think the original is a beter game (and thus rated it as such), but this is the one we continually play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Rating after one play. It's somewhere between vanilla Settlers of Catan and Cities & Knights in terms of complexity, but it feels longer in play than it needs to be, and the strategies seem more straightforward than I would like for a game of this length. The little ships are a neat gimmick, and I'm sure including them has sold copies that otherwise wouldn't have. But I think it would have been better (and certainly far cheaper) to have used a chit pull system for the ship speed, and some sort of on-board score track for boosters, cannons and fame rings.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
If you own Settlers already, I wouldn't bother with this.  In fact I wouldn't bother with it at all.  You'll feel pretty childish playing with the starship toys, they're most of the reason for the price, and they're prone to breakage if you're not careful.  Enough different than Settlers to not really be the same game, but enough the same you don't need to trouble yourself.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Great game... crappy components.  The time to play is not too bad.  It's not really a "heavy" game as most people put it.  But I do find it has enough strategy and player interaction to make it fun.  An open vote will always choose Settlers, but having this one set up before the company arrives will still make for a fun game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Despite the abuse that has been piled on it, this is one of the great games of the 90s, and has eclipsed even Settlers for me - only Settler's great variety of scenarios gets it played over Starfarers anymore. With the randomness toned down (yes, that's correct), and the number of viable strategies vastly increased, and with a great "fun factor", this is a tremendous game that belongs in virtually any collection.

Probably my favorite Settlers variant outside of the base game.  There are a few more decisions to make here, and the components (make sure to get the free booster rings from Mayfair so your ships don't break!) and choose-your-own-adventure style encounters are just plain cool.  If only the game got off to a little quicker start, this one would get a very high rating.  As is, I still enjoy it quite a bit as a once a year affair.

Overproduced, anyone?  The rocket ships are not only unnecessary (a die would do) but are easily broken.  The ship upgrades could've been tiles or cards instead.  Other than that, I guess the rest of the pieces are necessary to run the game.

This game is all right.  I like the exploration aspect of the traveling, and it reminds me of how some of my friends and I would make up our own exploration variants for Settlers way back when (when we didn't know other Euro games).  My problem main problem with the game: there's too much chance in this game for my taste.  Not only does this game include the randomness of die rolls for resource generation and the random numbers on planets, it also throws in random encounters.  On the plus side, a good outcome in a random encounter can let a player who's far behind catch up all of a sudden--but the player in the lead could just as easily get a good outcome that clinches the game by a big margin.

I definitely prefer this version of the game over the original.  There is enough other things going on that it keeps my interest even when I am losing.  My only complaint is that it can get a bit tight in the 4 and 6-player versions as you run out of space to colonize and have to focus on other aspects to gain the win.   It forces diversification, but if forgotten can lead to a late game stall.

I tossed the insert and created my own foam-core insert to fit all of the expansion in here as well.

The first thing about this game is the incredible cool factor that the ships provide. If this was a game for 10 year olds it would probably get a 9. The components are amazing. However this is the only game for which I have ever mentioned the components at least as far as I can remember. I almost never take it into account either for or against. So I'm giving this a 6.5 because it's not as good as the original settlers. It has some elements that are better and there is more to it. The original is quicker, cleaner and not as susceptable to luck. Traded.

One play.  Not nearly as bad as Eric says it is, and it is clearly one of the more inventive Catan derivatives.  But our game went on waaay to long for something that's not that deep or strategic (about 2.5 hours).  The others assured me that was a fluke and the game usually plays in under 90 minutes so if I ever try it again we'll see.  That would raise the rating a full point.

I vastly prefer this version to standard "Catan". The encounter cards, and the need to go exploring make the game much more enjoyable, and MUCH less about "placing correctly" on a board and cutting off you opponents. Much more room for back-and-forth play, but still suffers from the tendancy to have a "run away" victory. This is still one of the games that almost no one says "No, I'm not in the mood" to.

RATING: 7.5
This is a beautiful game with enough similarities to Settlers of Catan to teach it to players familiar with that game, and more than enough differences and unique features to not be trapped in the shadow of its predecessor.  However, it is a fairly long game and can be somewhat daunting for new players (especialy when they see the tray FULL of figures), and so many of the encounter cards are total gambles that it sometimes feels too much like guesswork when you are given an option, for example, to give a merchant a number of cards of your choice without knowing until your choice is made what the outcome will be.  In all, this is a good game to pull out once in a while for variety, but it is not something I can play again and again without giving it a rest for a few weeks.  Better for four players than three, but works for either.


Unlike some users, I have had no problems at all with broken or flimsy game pieces.

A very nice twist to the Original game. This game isn't available in Dutch, so we play the English version. The game takes quite a while to understand so it's not a typical game to play with first-timers. However, when you do know how it's played, then it's a very nice game. As all Catan-games the games take quite a while and it's not easy to finish on top when you fall behind. Will play again, but not soon probably as there are quite a number of games that play better and faster.

Enough like Settlers that basic strategies carry over well, with a fairly shallow learning curve.  Different enough that one doesn't make you tired of the other.  Sort of like Puerto Rico/San Juan.

This was a victim of the Settlers' popularity, where anything with Catan in the title was selling like a hot cake.  The game has a silly space monsters fighting theme and is by a large margin the worst of all the Catan incarnations.  It does include space rockets, though.

I love SF so this game is much better than the vanilla Settlers to me, a bit too long perhaps but much added diversity with the event deck and the aliens still makes it playable once in a while. Don't forget to play with the speed up rule that you draw two resources if below 7 VPs.

We do call it the dildo game for obvious reasons, what was the designer thinking of when designing it I wonder? ;)

RATING: 5
Fun game, but there is too many random encounters.  I think it definitely needs tweaks such as making random encounters only happen when the black ball is at the bottom of the mothership.  Also fuel seems overpowered.  A tweak here or there and this could go up.  Horrible design on the motherships...they break when you try to snap on the fuel boosters.  In terms of mechanics issues...trading has been reduced and fuel is overpowered.  Good for a play or two until this is discoverd.

RATING: 6
A great port of the Settlers system into space.  Players have to draw resources from planets, build colony and trade ships, and send them out to further colonise the galaxy. Trade ships pick up powerful bonuses.  Spare resources can be spent tooling up your ships so they fight better, move faster and can colonise frosty planets - and it has to be done to minimise the damage from the events and reap potential rewards.  This is a good game.

Finally got a chance to play a couple of games. My rating above is with a couple of house rules, seen here on bgg.

RATING: 7
A very fun theme, but the game is way too long. In a somewhat "Days of Wonder-fashion", the components are fantastic, but the gameplay isn't anything to write home about. Of all of the Catan games I have played this one has the highest luck factor. The adventure feel is sweet, but I would expect the encounter cards would get old after many plays. This is a game I'd probably only play a couple of times a year, but would enjoy it at that frequency.

A whole lot more random and longer than original Settlers. Especially with the 5-6 player expansion (lengh wise). If I ever play Starfarers again, it won't be with the 5-6 player expansion. The game lasted like 4 to 5 hours to play. Way too long for me with the expansion. Boring.

Some cool ideas, I enjoy the theme, but way too slow and very little player interaction compared to the original. Replayability not as high. Great components.

There are too many better games out there that playing this game on a regular basis is a waste of time. 

I don't plan to play Starfarers of Catan any time soon.

At this point I probably enjoy playing this game more than the original Settlers,(high praise indeed) but let's face it, nothing can truly top the original.  As a side note, I am tempted to lower this game's rating to a 7, because every one of my starships has broken after only casual use.  This wins my "most fragile game" award for shoddy craftmanship.

After the initial enjoyment of exploring planets and encountering aliens, the game starts to bog down and can sometimes take forever to reach its conclusion.  It can be extremely difficult for players to secure the last few VPs needed to end the game, causing the game to teeter on the verge of conclusion for what seems like an eternity.  But I must say, the amazing bits and strong theme do help to keep you drawn in during most of the game.

I enjoy this game a lot more than Settlers of Catan. The space exploration theme is done really well. I really like the random encounters portion of the game, the mother ship customization, and the interaction with alien races. The things that I like about this game really balance out any negatives that I described above in my comments about Settlers. Definitely more fun than the regular Settlers of Catan game.

I love this game so much more than Settlers of Catan.  There's less friction within the group as no-one gets cut off to quite the same extent as in Settlers.  Mayfair games even sent me the replacement parts to hold on the engines, so it's visually quite appealing.

Gave it to good friends as it was out of print and they loved it more than I do.

I really enjoy this game.  It has all the fun mechanics of Settlers, plus the cool sparkle of a science fiction universe.  My only gripe is that the game wears out its welcome by about a half an hour.  That's when it goes from being really fun, to starting to wish that somebody -- anybody -- will win and end it!  I've tried playing with the "quicker" variant that gives two cards from earth for those below 7, but it doesn't appreciable speed things up.

My impression is that with the right group, the extra time wouldn't matter.  (No tired sighs.)  Unfortunately, I don't have that group.

The most underrated and now UNKNOWN Catan game. It's out of print which is a huge shame. Catan in space was a great idea until the watered-down Star Trek version came around. My only criticism is that the big plastic ships would break, but this doesn't affect gameplay at all. Please bug Mayfair and tell them to reprint this and make a new and improved edition. You get to settle and explore space AND fly around and have encounters with aliens. It's an awesome game.

A great sit back and enjoy exploring the cosmos experience. Quirky components lift it hugely - they're not just novel but very practical. It's long but I feel a game like this has to be.

Curiously this was in my collection then vanished from the geek. Clearly the german entry was merged into this one and the summary hardly explains anything.
WARNING 1
Big problem, don't get the german edition if you're not all fluent. The game has encounter cards that require y/n decisions on a simple flowchart. This dramatically affects game-play and brought our attempt to a halt.
Combined with the poor rules-set here (but thanks for those that have submitted anyway) we had a miserable time with this.
It is a still a good game, more like other space exploration games than like Settlers though.
WARNING 2
I broke two teeth on one ship putting the engines on and off. And I was really careful. You'd be better not pushing them on at all.
I'd have given this 9 but these aspects.

** Played again with a german reader, and it still took 4 hours. Fun, a good variation, but long for the result. Way too many encounters brings way too much luck into the game. Update - marked it down to a 6 now, because it contains luck in two forms, firstly the dice roll, then the ship shake. The dice I can accept, the probability is a key mechanism there, but the extra randomness of the shaker is too much. The probablity that a black ball will appear is something like (1/4)+(1/3), which makes it pretty likely. That much randomness is too much.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A good variant on the Settlers game.  The space theme works well, and it's fun uprading your own ship (be careful with the boosters).  The discovery of planets and alien enhancements make this a gamer's delight.  I like the ship's colored ball mechanism, but the Event cards remind me of "Chance" or "Community Chest."  Grade: B

I was so excited when this came out that I hurried out and bought the German edition.  To compensate for the incomprehensible card translation sheet, I made a flowchart that was incomprehensible to everyone but myself.  (Actually, it was a dichotomous key, but I didn't know that until I thought about it just now.)  Anyway.  The mechanics are fun, and I'm curious what the >4 player expansion does.  But the phallic plastic ships are so brittle!  Basically now that a couple of years have passed, if anyone attaches a thruster, they are pretty much guaranteed to send a little plastic chip flying off the ship.  Boo!  Bad plastic choice!

Played 2 times. This game has a fairly good space-exploration theme. Not just another Catan add-on either -- definitely has a lot of its own game. Pretend it's Star Trek or something. The onyl complaint is that is does tend to run a lot longer and get crowded in a 4-player game, making the 3-player game a better bet in my opinion. Probably get bored if I played it too often, but the underused space theme boosts it up to a 7.

I wrote a review for this game, it's a favorite in our household.  Game is a lot of fun in 2 player variant too.  Plays in 90 to 120 minutes.  Interesting that this is one of my wife's favorite games.

I recommend adding the expansion even when playing with 2, 3 or 4 players.  It adds more star systems and one more alien race -- making the game seem to play faster.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2.1
I've played this once.  No matter what I did to my spaceship, the black ball fell on perhaps 80%+ of my rolls, forcing me into encounter after encounter.  The encounters are pure random luck, since there are identical ones with different outcomes.  Some of them you're hosed no matter what you do.  And they provide a runaway loser effect; the more encounters you fail, the more likely you are to fail encounters, because your success depends on the strength of your ship versus one of your opponents, and all too often you lose upgrades when you fail encounters.  By the end of the game I had lost every single upgrade to my spaceship.  It was 2+ hours of tedious, joy-sucking hell.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
One of the most brilliant of the Catan series; this game involves players colonising other planets for victory points.  The added gimmick of the starships is excellent and brings an interesting new element to the game, as does the contact with alien races.  In some ways the starship is like the advancements in Stone Age Settlers, and the alien races like the exploration tiles.  My favourite of the Settlers series would be a toss-up between these two.

I find this has much less of a flow than the regular Settlers.  I actually like Starship (just for 2 players) much better.  And the breaking ship clips is really annoying in a game that costs $50.  I did get the new rings, but it's still a pain.  And the game just seems to take forever.  And the little balls in the end of the Starships are about the stupidest game mechanisms I've ever seen.  Wow, just writing this making me like it even less...

One of the people in my game club suggested we play with the ability to attack other players with your starships.  It might actually add some player interaction to a game which has so little!  And it needs it SO badly...

RATING: 6.5
Huge quantity of components not least the huge motherships (made of brittle plastic!).  Great to play but due to the fixed board doesn't have the replayability of the original Catan.  Alien trade planets add another dimension.  A quick email to Kosmos and 10 days later I have the plastic rings for the spaceships engines.  Thanks Kosmos !

Update 17/10/2013:  Got this one out again after a gap of a few years and it was a dead flop.  It looks as awesome as ever but we had real AP issues with one player and everyone became bored very quickly.  Dropped rating as a result.

Although Starfarers is superior to the original Catan, it still has flaws: first, there is almost no player interaction (even the thief mechanism has been removed) second, because of this lack there is no way to overtake the leader; a leader, in fact, who may owe his position to nothing more than luck. Third, the alien races one visits have almost nothing of any value to offer you. Now, there are one or two items that are important but most are not worth the effort it took to get them. And finally, the encounter  cards only affect the active player, which increases everyone else’s downtime unnecessarily. But at least Starfarers doesn’t have the silly "longest road" VP condition of Catan.

RATING: 7
An extremely enjoyable Catan-system game. Obviously, I have a better love for this theme than the medieval theme of the parent game. It has the basic mechanics, but adds a little more with ship upgrades and friendship options with aliens (that give bonuses). By far the most interesting addition are the encounters, which are little "choose your own adventure" cards that really add some flavour to the game. I thought I wouldn't like them at all but I can say now they are a very interesting part to this game and I've never played a game that has something like them. The game felt a little repetitive at times, but hey, This is Catan! So yeah, definitely on my top list of Catan games.

I wanted to like this, as I first played this when still a little wet behind the ears and Settlers was yet to become stale.  The idea of a Euro game with plastic modifiable spaceships sounded dreamy yet the game play fell short.  Granted my rating is based of one and a half plays, so may not have any real substantive claim to an accurate rating, but i don't have any desire to play this offering by Teuber again - especially since Elasund has been released and I have found that to be the worthy succesor to the original.

Of all the spin-offs to come out of the "Catan" franchise (and there have been many), Starfarers of Catan is my favorite. An abbreviated list of improvements compared to The Settlers of Catan:
- somewhat unknown production when deciding where to expand
- long-term merchant benefits (compared to short-term gain from development cards)
- encounters
- resource aid until you reach a certain point threshold
- more ways of earning points

After 3 and a half months of waiting, the game is finally in my hands. 
One play (4 players), nice theme, funny, easy to learn, very good artwork and components, moderately luck dependent, a little bit long for what it is but i think it flows smoothly with insignificant downtime.

2 days after the game arrived I sent a mail to Mayfair, asking for the 4 rings of the starships. (Those of you who  know a little bit of Starfarers, should know what it's all about).

Surprisingly, i got an answer later the same day! But not only that, the rings where at my door 3 days later!

Only played a couple of games so far but it has made a good impression. The comments about randomness are, I suppose, true, with both the die roll and the mother ship randomisers. The event cards add flavour to the game though, and can speed it along considerably. It takes a long time to play and our first game with six players went on for about 3 1/2 hours! However, everyone said they enjoyed it and didn't really notice the time - which says something. Oh, and yes a mother ship broke  the first time I attached a booster . Got the engine rings from Mayfair in the USA in a few days - excellent service.

It's heavier than Settlers. I only played it once not realizing how much you have to focus on the game. I'll admit that may have impacted my impressions of the game because I played with a group I had hoped to socialize with while we were playing. I'd definitely give this game another go.

Initial Rating: 5

I have only played this once, and it was a learning game for everyone included, which made for an unusually long game. We also had to do some direct translation from the german cards so maybe we did get some rules wrong.

Compared to the original Settlers of Catan (I have not played any of its expansions) this is the better game, even though it is longer. Possibly much longer.

Pros: 
* The game is more forgiving of "unlucky" die rolls in the beginning of the game since you get at least one card every turn.
* It is cheaper to trade with the "bank" here than it is in the original game. 3:1 instead of 4:1. The reason I think this is good, is that if you play with people who are hardly ever willing to trade, the game will bog down and you will have to wait for your luck to turn around.
* The friendship cards you get when building trade stations at the alien home planets are nice and give the game a nice asymmetric feel where the players will have different abilities.
* The encounter cards were very fun, and although they were probably the most time consuming when trying to translate the game it never detracted from the gameplay


Cons:
* Long playtime. I actually think the game would be fine if played in 2 hours, and maybe it usually does just that. But in my first learning game it took an unreasonable amount of time. Mostly due to trouble interpreting the foreign language I would say.
* Low quality on the plastic motherships. Maybe it was just the copy I played, but we couldn't put the drive engines on the mothership without something breaking.

Good game, a nice variation on settlers.  Had the broken ship problem, that was not fun.  

Just pulled this out after 2 years and I actually liked it more then I remembered.  Just uped my rating.  I now after game after game after game of Settlers think I prefer this one.  There is more of an open field, no one gets pinned in and there is more to do each turn.  A little more random and less strategy then Settlers but now I think more fun because of it.  If only the damn motherships didn't break.

Played this to death. That's the trouble with kids and not enough games. It is a pretty cool looking game, with the pimped out space ships and large colourful space board with little rocket ships buzzing around the galaxy in search of wealth and patronage from other friendly races. It has much the same mechanic as basic Settlers with more rules and a little more complexity and depth. I think the luck element is about the same, with the annoying robber element still there, and another even more annoying one, where someone can steal resources from a player ahead of them on the score board. It can be played in 60 minutes (depending if someone gets lucky), to 90 minutes with 4 people, to at least two hours plus, if everyone if playing not so well with not much luck.
Some games we have had, especially when beginning, took almost three hours! The trouble is, if you pimp your ship to early and your score goes over the free card level, you can find yourself with few resources being collected and your game grinds to a halt while everyone else catches up. This game therefore it could be said, does reward a balanced approach between pimping ship and setting up space stations and trading stations, but saying that I have seen plenty of wins which negate that theory.

This is what Settlers should have been, and this is from a medieval-fantasy buff who doesn't like sci-fi.

It is too expensive when looking purely at how much game you get for your money, but they have plastic spaceships you shake to roll balls? What more could one need.

I received this game as a Christmas-gift from my older brother, as I had wished for Settlers, but when he was in the store and looked at the boxes, "This one seemed much cooler, with all the plastic bits and spaceships. The other one just had sheep and fields, screw that!".

This somewhat simple statement wonderfully explains the difference between Seafarers and Settlers
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
(1 play, 4 players) A very enjoyable game. Of course, the bits are fun to play with, but I liked the game as well. It took us quite a long time, unfortunately, but I think everyone enjoyed it the entire time, and it will speed up with repeated play. The best part was how close the final scores ended up being. Often in regular Settlers, one player (especially in 4-player games) is irredeemably behind. Here, even the person in last place had a good shot at winning the game.

It has a lot of random elements, with a few too powerful outcomes (free ships and space jumps) which may be very unbalancing. Also, I felt there wasn't much competition for the trade outposts, and even less with 3 players. But the game is so full of atmosphere and the components are so great that I'm always eager for a chance to play it again. I must say the flawed design of the motherships was a real annoyance, but the new rings, which Mayfair promptly sent me, solved the problem.

Somewhat like Settlers, but not really. It is much more exploration based. Perhaps a bit more comparable to Seafarers in that regard, but with a flavor all its own. Great bits, shame that they are so fragile. I had trouble with their customer service actually getting the rubber rings to me, but now that I have them, I can actually enjoy playing the game. There is a bit more chance here than in Settlers, and it takes a bit longer in general. I really have enjoyed this game, but I don't get to play it all that often.

While this might very well be the most over-produced version of Catan out there (with the exception of the deluxe versions), it's not as 'tight' as vanilla Catan. If you play this with a group that is not willing to engage in the mystery of space exploration in which not all quantities are (potentially) knowable, like I did, this game falls flat on its face. Perhaps with the right group, this fast and loose approach to Catan would have been a lot of fun.

[Initial Impression: 7]
Far, far more enjoyable than the original Settlers (the original kept me away from Eurogames for several years, because my friends always cited it as the premier example and I disliked it - I rate the original a 4).  Although the core mechanics are similar, a player is much less likely to get resource-screwed: you can spread out across the board so that suitable locations are relatively easy to establish, trading with the bank is at 3:1 or 2:1 for 1 resource type ("trade goods"), and if you're low on victory points you get a dole of 1 resource card per turn.  There is a lot more going on as well - you have several options of upgrades to purchase, and the encounters, although random card draws, allow an extra decision point on many turns. Because no victory points are secret, there is less of a runaway leader issue - although that's in part because the leader will get cards stolen from them more. The theme and bits are so much more engrossing, and there seems to be more interaction between players.  It still plays a little slowly for the game's depth, but it's nonetheless something I would look forward to playing again - I'm glad I let myself be convinced to try this one.

I like the original Settlers for many reasons, most that are related to the social aspect of the game.  Starfarers left me cold.  The game is similar to Settlers, but has a confrontational aspect as "encounters" force you to battle against your opponents.  The encounters also lengthen the game, which is a drawback. Finally, I purchased this when it did not look like an english version would be available.  Translating the cards, and then having the plastic pieces break frustrated me and my fellow players. 

The game has really cool Buck Rogers style rockets and I liked the idea of building onto them.  For me, it was what sold the game but it could not save it.

This one is terribly random.  Listening to the rules, I imagined a much more fun game.  But I believe since both players start at the same end of space, it's a race in the beginning and the roll of the dice help you out there.  Plus, the mothership broke when we tried to put the boosters on.  That was sucky.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A straightforward variant on the roll for resources-trade-build system done with a space theme this time. Trouble is, with no robber you can't rein in an early leader, so once you're behind, you stay behind. The game has plenty of luck in which number chits you 'fly by', and the encounter cards throw in further randomness as outcomes are so unpredictable. Those 'merchants' you keep meeting may be generous, parsimonious or pirates in disguise, no real world experience will let you deal with them successfully. With such a rich-get-richer element the playing time is an issue, this is just too long at 2 hours and the components are just ridiculously over-produced.

April 4th, 2007, I've played this twice now.  The first time I really liked it (years ago).  This second time I've had the experience of playing other games which consume less time and less effort to learn.  This game takes a decent commitment to learn how to play and you will spend your first game learning what to do.  It takes a looong time to play too.  With that said, it was still fun, however I'm not sure that I would like to play it over other shorter games.  So I guess on the scale, it would rate a bit lower than other games that I like.  It does have a lot of options and decent balance of luck/strategy.  I recommend giving this game a play or two, however I'd strongly recommend playing it the second time to reap the rewards of learning how to play, etc.

Picked up the game, at first the price was a little daunting but once the box was cracked open and the first game played, you came to realise that it's all worth it.  The rules did take a little getting used to as you first learn to play but once you know them, the game went alot smoother and faster.  There are many ways to victory and the only thing I found that could have been tweaked is the encounter cards (always take the most noble route and win... else consequences are bad) they need a little tweaking in a sense that you shouldn't need to take the best route always.  But other than that the game is excellent and everything just feels right, just like when you play the original Settlers series, it's just FUN!

My favourite of the Catan series games. Uses a spaceship which accepts accessories for shields,boosters and missiles as well as a unique coloured bead movement mechanism to determine ship speed makes this an intriguing game of space exploration and alien technology acquisition. My only fault is the space wormhole jump which gives a huge edge to the player that gets there first and with it the most advanced technologies.

RATING: 7
Like Settlers of the Stone Age, spaceships transform into colonies, so you have to keep building. Like Seafarers, you don't know the resource number until you visit the planet. Role-playing flavor from encounters bring in decision-making & another player on your turn. Gain special abilities by trading with the aliens. Slow movement/exploration even with modification of extra movement points. Bits are neat.

RATING: 10
I don't care what anyone says.  This is a GREAT game.  One of my very favorites.

It has TONS of tiny colorful pieces, and spaceships that work as dice.  Even the most reluctant player cannot help but give Starfarers a shot when they see it getting unpacked.

Also, it really captures the feeling of space exploration.  You're really trying to fly out and see what's out there.

*BEST OF ALL*: (Brings score up to a 10) They finally fixed the problem with the engine boosters breaking the brackets off the ships, and the fix is perfect.  The new rings don't look like cheap add-ons, they look great!  Like they were always there.  If your copy of Starfarers don't have them, call Mayfair and they will mail you some for free, no questions asked.  THANKS, MAYFAIR!

I now prefer this to regular Settlers of Catan.  It's basically a rethemed Settlers with some nice thematic touches -- the rocket ship playing pieces are especially well done (though fragile: the top broke off one the very first play, and later that same ship broke in half).  The large Encounter cards with their decision trees are also creative and lots of fun.  I swear Klaus Teuber was thinking, "I must have a Roll & Move game!"  It's the most creative Roll & Move you'll ever see (the value of the roll is determined by two colored beads at the bottom of the rocket ship).

ruins a classic by adding a load of nonsense (not to mention some fragile plastic toys). everything good about this game are the parts that survived from classic Catan. The starfaring part introduces some messy NPC trading races which give random abilities that aren't particularly well balanced. I'd advise giving this one a miss, unless you love playing with toy spaceships.

Lacks the simplicity that makes Settlers enjoyable. I loved the encounter mechanism at first, but soon realized that they occur way to often. I think I would enjoy it more with a house rule that reduced the probablility of the encounters - they just interrupted the flow of the game too much.

28.10.2009: Quite fun to play. I won the first three times I played it, so that might have raised my opinion of it. It's more random than Settlers and also longer, but have more ways to score victory points and you don't feel constricted in your movement. Since you play to 15 victory points I think the added randomness evens out in the end. I also like the free random resource you get on your turn in the early part of the game. Can get a bit boring if people overanalyze their moves. It's not that type of game, get a move on!

One of my very favourite games. The best Settlers spin-off. In fact a better game than Settlers. Beautful components and a gorgeous board. 

The settlers move into space in style. Fixes the main problem with settlers, early in the game you draw a random resource on your turn. This resolves what I think is huge issue in settlers, you can just be unlucky with the dice roll and not draw any resources for a few turns, and be out of the game.

Pretty darn good game!  The makers of Settlers Of Catan should feel proud!  The game is presented well.  It has a HUGE inventory of pieces which prabably explains the high price tag (44.00 to 59.00 depending on where you shop)  You certainly do get what you pay for! The game is of superb quality and realy quite easy to get up and running although you do need at least 3 players for a game.  The rules are explained quite well and there is an example game to get you aquinted with the system in use.  Have played 2 games so far and seem have the rules down pretty good.  Game time is suggested 2 hours. Our games have run a little longer...2.5 to 2.75 hours but we had to go thru some rules questions.  The thing I really like about this game is that there are so many ways to win!  Another big factor is that it is SO much different than Settlers.  Where as there was so much determined in the initial set up and a great deal of luck involved in the game, Starfarers has these problems rectified.  If you are pondering this game I highly suggest it...LOADS OF FUN TO BE HAD BY ALL!!!!!!

I liked it at first and thought it was an exciting addition to the Settlers group of games.  After repeated play though, the encounters got repetitive, and they seemed unbalanced.  Some results were clearly better than others, and there wasn't enough of a disincentive to accept a challenge.  The result of encounters, good or bad, added more luck into the game, and unlike die rolls (or in this case, color-coded rolls), the encounters don't seem to even out in the end.  It would be worth trying out, for the novelty factor, if you haven't already, but I wouldn't recommend owning it.

I enjoyed this more than I anticipated.  This does add length to the Settlers system, which is a drawback.  But I think that with experience we can cut the playtime down a bit.  I enjoy the encounter cards, which add a completely new element to the game, but it seems to add a wildly random element to the game.  They don't seem to unbalance things too much, my main complaint about them would be the length they add to the game.  But I like the exploration aspect of the game, and the theme (I'm not usually a fan of science fiction) makes it kind of fun, almost more feasible than the regular Settlers theme.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A space-exploration game with a touch of role-playing added in. Its very interesting to play the Euro-half against the American choose-your-own-adventure half. There isn't as much a scarcity of resources in this game as there is in Settlers, which is a good thing, but there is a predominant luck factor in the game.

Components are fantastic and add a great deal to the game. I would've liked to see more varied encounter cards though. The current ones there are good, but limited (i.e. they all seem the same after a while).

As far as looks go, this has got to be the prettiest game I've yet to see. The components are stunning. Good quality plastic, cardboard, and wood. My rule is that players must have played Settlers at least once before trying Starfarers, though, because it is a step up in regards to complexity.

I got this game half price at Wizards of the Coast, which is good because $60 seemed quite a bit at the time for a game. The components of the game look nice, but they are very fragile. This game can take a while to develop due to the rather slow rate of production. It is easy to get a little frustrated when you have been spending forever going across the board and someone else gets teleported there for free ahead of you, but you have to realize there will be random events you can't control.

RATING: 7
This can be a pretty fun game, but I highly recommend getting a Deck of Dice to go along with it. Some games can be very one sided due to a bad run of the dice. It can run long for what it offers, so perhaps playing for fewer victory points might be better for some groups. I actually enjoy it a little bit more than regular Catan. The only knock I have for it is that it can start off slow. Compared to regular Catan, it's not that much more complex but does give you quite a few more ways to achieve victory. The resources seem to be a bit more scarce earlier in the game which keeps trading to a minimum compared to regular Catan. I do like how the difficulty of the challenges are based on the other players which pressures players to keep the arms race going more than they might wish to and allows the difficulty to ramp up over time and keep pace with the game play.

Enjoy playing, but the game seems to take a bit to start and then moves fast and just as it starts to become enjoyable (with the cannons and boosters added), someone gets that last point and the game ends and it's never something miraculous that ends the game so I always feel somewhat let down at the end.

Also noticed that the pieces are quite fragile.  Boosters have broken pieces of ships because they just didn't fit where they were supposed to fit.  We now just sit them beside the ships instead of trying to fit them on.

Interesting branch of the Settlers game...totally stand alone game but incorporates much of vanilla Settlers in its action sequence outside of moving.  Love the use of the mother ship to find out how far one moves in a turn and the decision tracks for the various event cards.  Personally, I think some of the special cards from trading with the different aliens may make the game potentially unbalanced.  Also, I would recommend use of a timer after the first game as this game tends to take 2-3 hours otherwise.  Don't play this with the 5-6 player expansion unless you want to be there all night!

RATING: 7
Better than Settlers IMO. States 3-4 players but plays VERY well with 2 although you loose a bit of the trading aspect (but not much). Too bad this is out of print. One of the most expensive games I have purchased when it was still on the shelves - and it was well worth it.

When I first played this, I thought it was THE Settlers. But after a few more games... I just don't know. I lost interest. It seems as if it is even more random than regular Settlers is, and once the coolness factor wears off, I end up choosing Settlers over this one 9 times out of 10.

Tentative 7. I think this is ONLY a 4 player game in order to ensure there are enough resources flowing among the players.

There are also some very basic things that you can do wrong in the early game due to inexperience that can make the game MUCH longer than it should be. It's still likely pushing two hours regardless of experience however.

I enjoyed the first play with all it's wondrous bits and crazy encounters, playing with 4 (3p first game) will tell me where this one truly lies.

The game is way too long.  I think the variant at the end of the rule book should be used all the time due to the fact that some resources are just plain scarce and can really slow that game down to a crawl for all involved due to the random placement of the resource markers.  the random placement of the markers I think makes the game alot longer and I thin I will try to figure out a way to make a more balanced spread and make the game flow faster.  I enjoyed the 1st 2 hours of the game but after that is got tedious.

     This game guts Settler's from crotch to crown and shrieks in glee as it basks in the blood of its slain predecessor.
     Seriously, it is a deeper and more enjoyable game with similar length.  Granted, it is a sci-fi environment and chucking cubes has been replaced by a simulation of self-discovery in adolescence as a random # generator,but I think the game adds a lot more while reducing some of the luck of its parent.  Having ships to outfit and a decision in what resources you'll get and the luck you need to get them really helps.  Alien races add to viable strategies for winning. I love this game. And I love myself. *violently strokes his own "starship"*

We played this quite a lot right after it came out, and then my great buying sprees of the early naughties relegated it to the back shelf. I remember wondering about all the comments here on the Geek about the allegedly fragile motherships, since we never had a problem with them.

Pulling it out after 6  years showed that the game itself had aged very well, whereas the ships hadn't. Since that one game left all of us wondering why we hadn't touched it for so long (although it does, in my opinion, only shine with four players), I'll be off to order some of those marvelous booster rings from Kosmos - amazing how rocket technology has progressed since the last millenium ...

Played once and won.  The game didn't engage me at all and I don't feel like I did anything to win.  I even forgot to move one turn.  Too many luck vectors (dice, encounter deck, ship movement, production counter placement, etc.) and too long of a game.

I have played this only one time so the rating will probably change. I did enjoy the game and would like to see what happens when people are a little more informed about when and when not to trade. It seemed that some people got nailed a lot on the 7 roll, while other were not hurt by it at all. We played with teh faster 2 resource draw when less than 8 vp's. The game still took a long time to play.

RATING: 8
I think this is a better game than SETTLERS OF CATAN. Within thirty minutes of starting SETTLERS there are usually two players who are out of contention for the win and they are forced to play out the rest of the game mumbling under their breath. STARFARERS adds another path to victory that makes everyone competitive throughout most, if not all, of the game.

A nice addition to the Catan family of games, although I prefer the original.  The events grow a little stale after you've played a time or two, and some of the events are way overpowered if you have the resources to take advantage of them.

Be sure to order the booster ring retrofit package for your motherships, in case yours is one of the 0.4% of the motherships for which booster holder breakage is a problem.  Oddly, 2 of the 4 ships in my box were among the 0.4%.  

Mayfair was prompt with the retrofit, however, and even replaced a mothership whose fame ring holder snapped off when my daughter bumped it off the table.

My favorite of the Catan games, and not just becasue of the toys that come with the game (though they're great to play with).  Changing placing roads to building starships, along with trading and encounters, makes it much meater and more fun than Settlers or Seafarers (those and Starship Catan are the only Catan games I've played).  It can be long with the 5-6 player expansion, or at least seem that way with more down time between players.

Adds a little more depth than settlers.  The playing pieces look great but the booster clips keep breaking off my rockets. I do have the replacement clips now so this game will see more table time.

So far I've only played this by myself to learn the rules.  But I had a lot of fun, and I'm excited to try it the way it's supposed to be played - with other Catanians!

I love sci-fi fantasy themed games, so this was a must have. It seems a bit complicated at first, but if you are familiar with Settlers things will settle in after the first turn or two. I would rather have and play this than the original with any or all of the expansions. My only sadness is the production quality on the mother ships. Three of mine broke the first time we played. This makes the anal-retentive collector sad.

Too much luck involved to still be true to Catan, IMHO.  My biggest complaint is that there's a distinct advantage from knowing what all the cards say beforehand.  For example, knowing what the possible outcomes are for paying merchants certain amounts of resources.  Or racing to get the power card that lets you steal other players mothership parts every turn.  

I'd rather play Twilight Imperium if I'm looking for an epic space game.  Still, it's a good game for what it is.

Similar to Settlers but ever so slightly different. Same basic resource production concept, but there are no roads built, rather you travel in ships that can be upgraded. In order to settle new colonies you buy colony ships and move them on your turn. Not as closterphobic as Settlers, sort of like Seafarers in the exploration. Alot of SoC players I know complain because of the random encounters that happen in space but I know alot of people including myself who enjoy it. The main downside is the game is a bit pricey at $60 retail.

File down your starships before applying boosters.  This is THE major problem with this game and is a bit aggravating.  Once you can get past that, the game itself is a fun take on the Settlers family of games.  Though the encounter cards make things a bit more random than I'd like, it doesn't detract from the gameplay.  There are many different ways to acquire victory points and the added aspect of the Flight Phase makes for an interesting elenment not present in other Settlers games.

Somehow manages to be a lot longers AND a lot more random than settlers -- two deadly sins as far as I'm concerned. THe bits are really cool and I love the sci-fi theme, but the design is sloppy and rushed at best. I mean, the ressource chits are face-down for the starting positions, face-down for the prospective planets, moving your ships to these new planets is random, on 40% of your turn you'll get a random event the outcome of which is, well, random,... I'm not sure why they even bothered. Too bad, I actually wanted to like the game.

As with all Catan games the rich do get richer so trying to get ahead early is a good idea.  The setup and downtime is significant though but worthwhile if you're looking for a relaxing (rather than brain-taxing) night of gaming.  I wouldn't mind if they came out with a new, meatier Starfarers game.

Was kind of fun for a while, until the encounter cards felt like they were too random. The real kicker was when the rockets started breaking and the little boosters wouldn't stay on anymore.

It did have the most elaborate game component ever with the rocket ship and its red and yellow balls.

I wonder if Mayfair will ever remake this game in a much cheaper version with some sort of replacement for the rockets?

RATING: 7
Decent settlers variant. One good aspect is that you cannot be blocked off by roads or ships since there are no permanent routes (just movable transport rockets). The events are mediocre. The race bonuses are unbalanced, but if everyone knows that then it is less of an issue. All in all, a nice game but not one that I would play all that often. My parents like it and I enjoy playing it with them.

RATING: 6
With the exception of Cities and Knights, my least favorite Catan.  Takes a very well balanced premise of the core Catan concepts, and adds a lot of additional rules which serve moreso to complicate(and throw off the good balance of) the original core.  Still, it can be good for a change of pace, though in general if I want a non-Catan change of pace, I'll play something that isn't Catan.

Very Settler-y.  Too long.  Ships are fun but unnecessary and fragile.  Encounter cards are samey and boring.  I won without making any trade ships or doing any of that, so I'm not sure if that avenue is even necessary.  Okay game, space theme and little ships are fun, but in the end, I would rather just play Settlers.

Way too long for a game with such a big dose of luck. (2011-08-16)

I originally found this game frustrating, because getting new production capabilities is difficult for several reasons.

Now that I have more experience with the game, I like it more. I discovered that all pirate lairs and ice planets are on chips with a red back, so you know what to avoid if you don't want to run into those guys. Also, there's more to the game that just increasing your production by getting new planets. You can go for the trade partnerships with the alien races, which are quite lucrative, or go for success in the encounters. The encounters are not entirely random; there are ways to improve your chances at them.

This game was our regular weekly-play for almost a full year.  It really holds up, especially with the 5-6 player expansion.  I love how the initial planet setup can spin you in a wildly different Whole Game Strategy.

Lots of fun.  This game is great for when I have an urge to play a resource trading game and don't mind a little extra set up.  The pieces are pretty cool, and the best part of this game is that each player gets there own space ship they shake to determine their speed.  You can physically snap expansions onto it.  The unfortunate part of the game is the dice factor.  Best played with four players, but also plays surprisingly well with two.

Nice space variant from SoC. The dice rolling and resources trading mechnics reconise from the original SoC. But ther are also many differnces. The occurence cards, the starship movement, the alien traiding bases, no roads (also no 2 points for the longes road), no points for the highest (laser) power...

In all its a nice buildup exploration game without violance trougth the player and with nice minatures and impressiv motherships (witch are very fragil, be quite!). When you like buildup games the long gametime from 2-3 h will not be a problem.

RATING: 6.5
Fun, slightly-lighter Catan game that requires piece movement and development across a static universe. VERY high production values.  The big complaint about this game is that there are a lot of random events that happen, and these can tip the balance of power.  I personally don't mind it; though the game can drag on for 2+ hours and isn't really worth the long time commitment.

I have played 2 very long (3 hours) games, both with 6 players. The bits that don't break :) are simply fantastic. There is a fair amount of luck which I don't mind, and more importantly, it's a lot of fun. However, if bad luck comes your way for a few turns, it can be frustrating with 6 players. I think (hope) it will play better with 4 as far as duration-frustration factor goes.

Yep, it takes too long and there's way too many events and too much luck. So knowing that, be prepared for a 'ride' game. Go with the flow, treat it as a bit of an adventure and see what happens. As a result I quite enjoy the experience and happily (occasionally) play again. There's an early game expansion to get your exponential Settlers resource growth thing happening. Then there's a mid-game build in non-growth assets that you'll require to get your last few victory points. And then clutch out for the final points. Amongst all that, some flavour unfolds through the event cards of many pirates and merchants. It has some boredom in there whilst you're waiting for your resource numbers to come up, and it takes a while to build up what you need for the final victory launch, but it provides some interesting avenues to explore along the way through a host of new special powers you can acquire.

This game is great fun! I had forgotten how great it looks once it has been set up. It's a very good version of the original concept with great implementation of the game bits! It has much more random elements then the original Catan  game, but this adds very nicely to the "space-exploration" feel that the game tries to achieve. Once the players know the rules, it doesn't take those two hours, but rather 1h30m, which is quite reasonable for this game. Very nice indeed! :)

Based on familiar Settlers ground, Starfarers is quite different.  It doesn't seem (to me) to have the level of variability of the other Settlers games, but it does have some new things.  I particularly like the big plastic spaceships and the colored-balls-method of introducing randomness.

A great variation on the Catan template - not as complex as Cities and Knights, but more options than Seafarers. I like the colorful plastic bits, and the alien races and events lead to interesting new tactics. A solid 7 in my book, but some people will prefer Cities and Knights. I actually think the best Catanian adaptation to the space opera genre is probably Ad Astra.

Originally I thought I would like this better than Settlers, but after playing both several times, I found that Settlers (with Cities and Knights) has a MUCH better player interaction system.  I like all the features and the theme of Starfarers, but as far as fun goes, I'll usually choose Cities and Knights (with good opponents).  With amateur opponents, this might actually be a better game, funwise.

I appreciate all the bells and whistles that this Settlers variant adds, but in the end, the whole process just ends up taking too long.  The special abilities granted by the aliens are pretty nifty, and add good flavor.  However, it's a little frustrating not being able to explore or get where you're going for turns and turns, as it sometimes happens.  I wish the giant plastic ships weren't so brittle, too.

RATING: 4
Mega-crome game. More costly that most Euros, but comes with tons of plastic. Primary value of this game is to "wow" non gamer friends with it's look. Not sure how this would play with super-competitve people, but I will probably never find out, as we will play the "less fiddly" instead. UPDATE: I am really ticked off at how fragile the large plastic ships are, I don't see how with more than a few plays you can avoid parts breaking off.

12/11/05: Missions are totally random, why? Little reason to trade, alien bonuses are hard to take advantage of. Random, random, random. Avoid.

8/06: Played this 3-4 times in early summer against niece, nephew and son (16, 13, 8 years old). Not quite as bad as I've said before, the powers make sense to me now. But if it annoys you when pieces of your game break (as it does me), you will hate this game.

Easy way to describe this game: If you can't get enough of Settlers (you know who you are, I used to be one of you), and you like Sci-Fi games, you will probably like it.

4/13 traded away

2014: This game completely fell apart on me. Literally parts came off of the spaceships, like every time I touched them.

Looking back, I did have some fun exploring the game-space.

It's definitely an unique and thematic twist to Catan, however doesn't have the player interaction and tightness of the original.

I like the theme, the exploration and space feel, and having many paths to victory with points.  I like the pity resource for having low victory points.

There is actually more randomness to this game, with the encounters not always controllable.  There seemed to lack trading, with people getting more ways to get resources, especially in a three player game.  The Friendship/trade point competitions seemed lacking in three player as well.

Not as good as ordinary Settlers, but still ok.
Too much luck. Dice, movement and encounters are all luck dependent. Especially the encounters. This makes it impossible to have a strategy.
And the leader cannot really win since there are so many ways to punish the ones in the lead.
Changes that I think would improve game play: 
-If you want encounters you can choose to have it. If you have invested heavily on cannons and boosters you really want an encounter every turn.
-Food is generally worthless, compared to the other goods at least.
-Some of the alien cards are way too good.
-Make the encounters more worth the trouble. Now there are cards with identical text but different outcomes. If you sacrifice cards in an encounter then at least some good should come out of it.

We are really liking this game; the bits make it very elaborate to behold.  Game play is rather fast and we like taht you always have something to do on your turn even though  you may not have a ship.  The encounter cards coudl be the only thing that could eventually hold this back later (after we have played more times); as it would seem after a while, you could memorize them.  It woudl be nice to have some that are interchageable...  A nice change of pace game from some of our more hardcore games.

This is my favorite family game because it has plenty of strategic depth, a great theme, and I can play it with anyone.  It's on the heavier side for a family game, but the plastic spaceships are flashy enough to get the game on the table - and it usually works pretty well after that.

Starfarers bares little resemblance to its predecessor, Settlers of Catan.  Emphasizing on Exploration and Ship Expansions, Starfarers continues to be enjoyable.  Encounters and alien race relations certainly add to the theme and fun. I must score an 7 because with all of this diversity, it is still not diverse enough to stop a certain gameplay tactic from succeeding almost time and time again, and also because my Starships broke after trying to affix boosters onto them. (A problem which Mayfair was willing to help me with).  It's fun, but more complicated then Settlers and certainly makes for longer gameplay. And - oh yeah - could the game bits BE any more phallic??  Seriously.  It's almost embarrassing.

RATING: 6
For me the scoring of vps boots up the competitive tension. The relaxed trading conditions (3 for 1 to the bank, 2 for 1 with trade goods), resources from earth, means less trading interaction, but this missing social factor is reintroduced via the flowchart encounter cards involving shaking your "mothers". This adds to the narrative atmosphere(sorry)injecting some humour, but this slows the game pace as does having ships on the board to move and explore: it just elongates a player's turn. So I can only really play this with 3. This then makes some of the planets/resource chips redundant. Then you have to reach 15 vps which stretches my tolerance past the 2 hour threshold. (I bought the expansion in the hope it would speed up play, but it's unplayed as I'm tiring of the Catan system). As for the playing pieces, very impressive until the clips holding the booster snaps. This is the main reason for my reluctance to play SoC, I can do without the emotional consequences when breakages happen. This is a shame as I've found the game had innovative elements and was good harmless fun; it almost has a party style feel to it.

An excellent game in the Catan formula: resource acquisition, trading between players, building, randomness that you have to deal with.  I love the exploration aspect, the multiple ways to win, and the competition for good spots before the other players take them.  The more I play the game, the better I like it.  Even better with the 5-6 player expansion, but excellent even with just 3 or 4 players.

Ugh. An over produced, convoluted, mess of a game. Catan is/was good because it kept it simple. This game is anything but. The only part i though was great was the "choose your own adventure" card mechanic. That was fun, the rest of the game, not so much. All the pieces VERY phallic looking.

RATING: 6
Haven't really played this enough to form a great opinion of it. One thing I noticed is that rocket props break REALLY easy. As in we broke 2 of them the first time we played the game. Perhaps snapping bits on and off the Rocket isn't the best idea. We ended up just setting the attachments next to the rockets.

Interesting take on Settlers in space.  I really enjoy the development of my rocket ship coupled with an interstellar colonization aspect.  Neat game.

My favourite Catan besides Cities&Knights. Flying with space ships instead of building roads is a very neat mechanic. 

I really enjoy that you physically upgrade your mother-ship. The encounter cards and the "dice rolling" with the mother-ships are a neat addition to the classic Catan mechanisms. Especially the encounter cards give some Ameritrashy flavor to the game. 

As basic Catan and Cities&Knights I would rather recommend this game for 3 players and less for 4, since otherwise you have quite some down-time and there are too little good spots on the map.

INTERSTELLAR CATAN VARIANT WITH SPIFFY BUT FRAGILE STARSHIPS
Excellent components and board - I received a more recent edition that was shipped with the clip ring (no need to request from the nmanufacturer anymore).  Much longer than regular Catan (I somehow nmissed that this was a 2-hour game when I purchased it) but lots of fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Played once.  The pieces are colorfully thematic, but only adequate (the game owner had added velcro strips to hold the boosters on to the motherships, board was slightly warped).  Game play was enjoyable but felt like there was a missed potential for a much better game.  I expect this is a candidate for a lot of variant rules.  (08-JULY-2008)

RATING: 5
15-01-2015. Rated after 1 play. Settlers of Catan with a twist. I do not really enjoy settlers of Catan and I found out I do not really like Starfarers of Catan.

Starfarers uses a fixed map instead of random setup with hexes. In Starfarers there is randomness in the the  number counters, each set of planets has their own counters to ensure that all resources have a certain distribution. The thing which changes most is that there is more exploration in Starfarers, which is akin to Seafarers or Pirates expansion that I think came later. I do feel however, that these games may do it better with more interesting choices.

In addition to the exploration part slowing the game down, the game also suffers a little AP and downtime from an additional action that happens after the trading and building. You move your space-ship around the galaxy, which is fun, but takes time as you have to 'roll' with your space ship and have to encounter stuff.

All in all, the game is more interesting than vanilla catan, but I am not sure if I like it better. At least vanilla catan is over in max hakf the time. Maybe we played rules wrong, but I felt that the resources were ecxtremely tight in this game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
If you love Catan, especially Seafarers, then you will likely love Starfarers.  With 5 resources and more things to build, it's a little bit more open what types of things you want to build.  The special ability cards you can get by traveling to them with merchant ships (IIRC) can be really cool too.  And it removes the blocking - you still need to race to get settlements where you want them, but you just travel to the spot, you don't lay down tracks that block other players' movement, so players are never screwed completely.  Until near the end, they can always just travel deeper into space to find an open spot to settle.  That also means, unlike in Catan where you can sometimes predict who will win after starting set-up, starting placement is not as critical - everyone's usually got a relatively similar starting position that can be quickly equalized with players preferentially trading with those in worse starting positions.

The bastard son of Settlers of Catan. Even more luck driven this time out. You can try to make some long term plans here, but they're only be superficial and you'll have to adapt to the changing situation and ultimately learn not to make any long term plans (which I hate). More ways to gather VPs here, but really only one main strategy to win (get a few planets, a few space stations and 2 aliens). A decent sci-fi game, nothing exeptional though.

Many of the 4 spaceships have plastic broken off of them.  I am told that Mayfair Games will ship for free grey plastic discs you can slip over the ship to hold the pieces previously assigned to the weak plastic.

Here we have an example of a good game made great by its components and art.  Careful not to drink too much while playing--we often catch ourselves trying to imbibe from our mothership instead of our stein.  Satisfyingly rich for most yet not so much as to repel casual gamers...one or two wives who are relectant to go beyond the likes of Monopoly generaly have liked this one.  Don't put your boosters into the "snap in" locations of the base of the mothership or you'll soon be looking for super glue (which won't work) and new motherships.  Sort of an unforgivable flaw for such a well-designed and delivered game (and on at its price point)...board can get crowded with too many players, which is frustrating since more players also make the game more fun in terms of ways to win and competition.  For whatever reason, one of my all-time favorites.  A bit like Settlers in outer space, I guess.

Has quite a race-feel to it and isn't just Setlers-in-Space  - it somehow feels more like a race than an exercise in engine-building and upgrading and developing your galactic empire (although if you know Settlers most aspects of the game will feel familiar).

Quite a long game, but it's a great way to spend an evening.

Starfarers of Catan -- I was initially concerned that Trade ships look too much like Colony ships, but found it was not a problem.  Aftermarket Rings are now available which allow you to attach Boosters to the Motherships without risking damage to the fragile built-in Booster clips.

This game is really great. Better than Settlers of Catan, but because the board isn&#039;t variable like Settlers, it tends to have less replayability than Settlers does. The movement and colony settling make more sense than the road building in Settlers. Also, there are some mechanisms for keeping the lead player from running away.

Take Settlers, chrome it up and set it in space, add a huge 'toy' element and you get Starfarers. The turn order is easy to get through: roll dice, take resources, trade, build, move spaceship/s.

There are lots of event cards and special cards that grant players abilities.

The only problem is that the multiple ways of scoring only serve to prolong the already long game. It's very much a race game and the dice can be a killer. Sure, there are ways to overcome the die rolls but like I said, you're putting too much time and effort into a payoff that's not worth the investment. The toy value is great and *almost* makes the game length bearable.

Shave off 30-45 minutes off the playtime and it will rate much higher. As it stands, I'd rather  play 2-3 other games in the same time it takes to play Starfarers.

RATING: 7
Exploration, Resource Gathering, Building. A pretty cool game - still has that Catan feel, but with an appealing space exploration theme and random encounters/events thrown into the mix. I admit I'm a bit burned out on base Settlers and C&K, so this was a breath of fresh air for me.

Feels more like a racing game than Settlers and suffers severly from "catch the leader" + potential kingmaking syndrome.

RATING: 8
Fun game that adds on to the SoC mechanics. You really don't want to be caught behind on your ship upgrades when it comes to encounters. Rules can take up to 15-20 mins to explain.

RATING: 5.2
Well, if you like Settlers and you enjoy the space-theme, you'll probably like Starfarers.  It's pretty much the same thing, except for the addition of random encounters and a few slight modifications such as traveling (as opposed to road-building), 2-hex "settlements," and galactic alliances.
The space ships are funny looking, but that's part of the strangeness and fun of Starfarers.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This version of is a fun experience that tends to overstay its welcome.  The original Settlers succeeds because of it's functionality, you want to trade to get the cards you need. Goods in Starfarers are useful for encounters, and the purchasing matrix is more difficult here, so you often times can't make worthwhile trades.  

The result leaves you feeling that the game is all luck and is mostly multiplayer solitaire.  Sure you can take stuff from players on the board before they can, but every thing moves so slowly that it is hard to imagine that you could beat people out very often.  

All of the bits are cool (other than the ships breaking from the boosters) and it is fun to upgrade stuff, but after a while it wears thin. 

There is high luck on explorations, where the pirate chips are near impossible to beat before the game is over, so they make founding colonies too difficult for trailing players. 

All of the game growth compounds resulting in a rich get richer problem.

The encounters are cool, but not varied enough.  Because you are playing this for a while and often have encounters, I get sick of space pirates, merchants, and distress calls.

Dear Starfares of Catan, you had a lot to live up to coming from such a prestigious family and, in any other family, you'd probably be a good game.  Don't get me wrong, you're fun, but its like riding a bike stuck in the wrong gear, players do a lot to not really go anywhere.  Have a good summer.

Same feel as Catan, but some key differences. Event cards are a new game dynamic that can set you back or prepare you for an early win. This game varies in length, but errs on the lengthy side so be prepared for only one game a night. The plastic ships in the game are a bit on the fragile side so this game is not for younger children (or drunken friends).

So happy to have a chance to play this -- it's a component whore's dream!  Very entertaining game as well, if it was a bit shorter I would never play Settlers again.  Really enjoyed the thematic look and feel of the game.  Catan in space adds a lot of great ideas to the franchise, and the goober in this game is ULTRA cool. I seriously love the components and I really like the gameplay as well. The only downer is the time, especially when you add in the expansion. Still, I'd play again in a heartbeat.

I haven’t played much Settlers, so my best comparison is with Starship Catan.  I like Starship for the entire 1.5h duration of the game.  It’s a race game where you quest through stacks of cards, garnering victory points for upgrading your ship, flying missions, colonizing planets, and establishing trading posts.  In Starfarers, much is the same:  you quest across a beautiful hex board, garnering victory points by establishing colonies, trading posts, and spaceports, and by liberating planets from ice or pirates through ship upgrades.  
Like Settlers, you roll for production, trade and build.  Then you “roll” your ship to determine the distance you travel (added to your engine power).  If you roll black (~38% probablility), an encounter card is drawn.  Sometimes these allow you to take advantage of ship upgrades you’ve made, but some are just random guessing.   These cards add a distasteful dose of luck into the game for the sake of theme.  You have to cross physical distance on the board to discover and colonize more resource planets, which allows you to improve upon bad starting position for some resources.   As I type this, I’m thinking “Hey, other than the encounter cards, that sounds like a pretty good game”, but I find that it drags on as people decide how to best negotiate their turn.  The space pirate wannabe (and Starship Catan aficionado) in me wants to like this game, and I still believe that with the right crowd, this could be a great time, but after 3 plays, it’s a 6.

RATING: 8
Not as good as Settlers of catan, but good for a little variety.  Plays slower than settlers, and seems less competitive in a way.  My biggest problem though, is the material the 'spaceships' are made of; all four of mine broke completely (the booster expansions) in less than five games(two broke in the first game).

RATING: 4
Neat idea.  Not fundamentally different from Settlers, but enough bells and whistles to make it a neat experience.  I'm a little sad that the locations of pirates and ice planets can be a little predictable, seeing that they're all on the red dot tiles, takes a bite out of the suspense of exploration.  But still playable.  A sweet change of pace.  It's not a regular play, but a great once-in-a-while offspeed pitch.

RATING: 5
Too long for what it is, but still an interesting variation on the Catan system. It's almost RPG-like with the exploration theme and the encounter deck. The end game is a bit slow for my taste, but overall I like the gameplay enough to play every once in a while, and the components really are impressive.

Drastically overrated, over random, over fiddly, over fragile, over long tripe that just didn't do it for me.  Worst of the series by far, and I've no desire to play again.  Just plain ick.  The fact you need to send away to Mayfair to get pieces to fix the breakable motherships is just inexcusable.  A rushed-to-print jobbie to be sure.  (So many people like it, I hesitate to say I'd NEVER play it again... but it'd take some serious convincing!)

RATING: 8
[Mayfair 2004 edition] {Space exploration; dice-rolling, development, resource management, trading} Klaus Teuber is an ambitious designer.  Clearly, he is not satisfied with just pasting a galaxy theme to existing Catan games.  He chooses to design this new game by adding many new elements to the core elements of Settlers

The great success of Settlers allows Klaus Teuber to create this game with exceptional (extraordinary) components.  The building of trading outposts and colonies is similar to basic Settlers.  But the development of the spaceships is unlike any other Settlers games, which provides tactical options and makes the game thematic and fun.  The "Flight" phase is interesting and unique, which fits the exploration theme perfectly.  The aliens provide many tactical and strategic choices.  The "sponsorship" rule for lagging players is a nice one to give them chances to catch up.  It is multifaceted, but without the complexity of Cities and Knights.

The game may look more chaotic (dice roll and mothership roll) and longer than the Settlers; however, I don't find it irritating because the game itself is very fun to play with.

In all, this is an enjoyable game to play / own, in addition to the Settlers of Catan.

This game is like a bad joke. I bought it trusting the Catan name. It is colorful and exiting. You will probably want to play a second game, but then you may find yourself thinking, "wait a second, this game sucks!" From big flimsy rocket ships to dumbed down randomization, to a set of event cards that turn it into a bloated game of shoots and ladders, the game falls flat on all fronts. It isn't that bad of a game, but the only things Catanesque it shares are the flaws. I'll play if others insist.

My first venture into the Catan series.  I played it with my wife and two friends the other night and absolutely loved it.  Pros: wonderful (but complex) rules and playing pieces.  Cons: it's a minimum of 3 players, which is awkward.  Also, the pieces can be a bit fragile (Mayfair has been very helpful to replace broken or damaged pieces).

I enjoy shaking my ship as much as the next guy, but I never choose to play this game.  If someone else picks it, I'm fine with playing it but I don't think it's got too much to offer.  One rule from this game that is a nice addition to Settlers is the free resource card prior to a certain number of victory points - this helps (a little) with the problem we have in other Settlers games where one person can just get cut off and, for all intents and purposes, eliminated from the game early.

RATING: 6.5
Played for my second time, and the games flaws really started to jump out at me.  I got completely screwed by the event cards, both directly and indirectly (eg. due to bad dice rolls, I had only 2 fuel, which I used to buy a booster.  I pulled a merchant card, had to give him 0 resources because I didn't have any, and he destroyed my booster.  End result, other player beats me to planet, and I had to settle for a crappy spot.  A different player space jumped all the way across the map near the start of the game and founded a spaceport over there long before we could get there -- as a result she was able to colonize and trade ship without competition, giving her a huge lead.  The third player space jumped all the way across the map to beat me to a spot I'd spent the previous 8 turns flying to and was just about to colonize on my next turn).  It's quickly becoming apparent to me that there's too much randomness in this game -- from the dice rolls to the event cards to the not being able to see the numbers on the planets before you get there.  Also, there are several very unbalancing game issues, such as the aforementioned space jumping being way too powerful, and the fact that people who fall behind in the game tend to keep getting screwed by the event cards since you're constantly compared to your peers.  Plus there are way too many events period -- by the end of the game I was groaning every time one came up.  So, in spite of loving space games, I can't take this game seriously as a strategy game, and it takes too long to play to put in my enjoyable whimsical games (eg. Munchkin) category.  I think it's destined to live forever in the cracks of uncategorization, as a game that could have been great but didn't quite make it.

For obvious reasons, this game plays similarly to Settlers of Catan. It's not a bad game, and I do enjoy the space exploration theme. The problem is that the event cards, while thematically fun, are random and repetitive. The larger board and greater supply of resources seem to lower player interaction (but that could be my imagination). In short, thematically, this game is just right or me. But as a game, I prefer the tighter Settlers of Catan.

This took me a couple of turns before I figured out how to order things.

Probably my favorite version of settlers of Catan...the choose your own adventure cards, cool (if probably also unnecessary) dice rolling space ships, and other chromey bits all add to the fun.  Unfortunately, it's about twice as long as it needs to be, because this is still just Catan at heart, and as such, has no business lasting more than an hour.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
The best part of the game?  The cool spaceships, of course!  Otherwise, it's SoC (reading the rules, I kept saying, "I've played this game before") with some interesting twists and additions to the core SoC mechanic.  I've mixed feelings about the exploration (hidden counter) aspect: on the one hand, it's more "realistic" than having perfect knowledge; on the other, it's easy to spend a couple turns exploring "undesirable" planets.

Without the expansion, it gets a little overly long. With it, though, it works well and is constantly engaging. So many cards and chips and effects and considerations. Is there luck involved? You bet. Is it fun anyways? No doubt. If I've got 2-3 hours to spare, I am totally fine with using it to play Starfarers. I'm constantly amazed by just how much new players love the game, especially those who already know Settlers - I mean, I like it a lot, but some people say they need to play another game of this ASAP.

RATING: 5.5
Have played several times.  Think the game is a little long for the play.  Will play again, but would be just as happy playing standard Settler's or another game.  Has a runaway leader problem or at least a last player can't catch up problem.
I like the game, but just can't justify the time it takes to get more plays.

An ok, but slow, game that moves the Catan system into space and actually changes it up more than in many of the Catan games.

I've been on the lookout for a good space exploration themed game for a long time and this is the best I've come up with. We like to play this with just 2 players, in which case the game doesn't usually last too long. I could see that one becoming a problem in bigger groups.

RATING: 6
Better than the basic set of Settlers, mainly due to the fact that it easier to close the gap with the leader and there are more ways in which victory points can be obtained. Also, the 5-6 player expansion is better thought out than the one created for Settlers. Play time is considerably longer though. Components are great, but pretty fragile: Luckily, Cosmos handed out free "engine rings" at their booth at Essen last year.

RATING: 3
Extra randomness (from the unknown star system contents) was the last kind of modification the Settlers game system needed. Some folks complain that regular Settlers of Catan has too much luck. This game has many other neat elements, but the core game is such a major disappointment that I can't recommend it--unless you like Settlers and think that even more luck would be just fine.

Played this once a long time ago. Was being introduced to board games by a friend after having played CCGs for several years. He's like, "Don't worry, many first timers don't do very well."

A bit too much luck, but otherwise lots to like. Awesome bits (but the big spaceships are a little fragile), good atmosphere, entertaining. As in all the Catan games, play is dominated by the effort to build up resource production, and effective trading is important.

This game would have been a lot more fun if the rocket ship shakers/dice equivalents hadn't all broken during the course of the first play through. They were not terribly well constructed and by the end of the game we had to pass the one intact shaker around in order to continue playing.

RATING: 7
The first two dice can decide the game, which is a big drawback. On the other hand, we have always lots of fun when playing it, so I feel generous with the rating.

Edit: As some of my friends absolutely love this game, we play it all the time. The game takes very long, so it's usually just one game at a time, and I don't really get fed up with it.

Klaus Teuber (Catan); colonise planets and trade with the alien races. You start at one end of the board with colonies and a port around numbered planets. The usual mechanisms apply of rolling dice, collecting resource cards (no space sheep, sorry), trading and building, developing your colonies and earning Victory Points (VPs). Where the flames for the rocket would be is a small clear bubble. Shake your mother ship and put it down and two colored balls fall into the bubble. If the are red, yellow or blue, your little ships move across the board. But if one is black, you face an adventure card. (A similar mechanism is used in Ab Die Post). Another player draws and reads you the adventure, and you must make simple yes/no choices. A flowchart on each card reveals the consequences, some good, some bad, and often you shake your ships to see what happens. Roughly though, pirates try to rob resources and if you win a fight you keep your cards and gain reputation (worth VPs). Or traders welcome resources and give you good stuff and reputation in return. But if you flee the pirates or stiff the traders, you lose stuff and lose reputation. There are also wormholes and wandering folk. Two cautions. If you have only passing German, don't bother with the German edition. While the adventure cards follow familiar patterns, there are enough subtle variations in the text to make this game impossible to play without a dictionary. Secondly, if your box does not contain 4 grey plastic rings to fit over the mother ships, do not attach the engines onto the ships. The mother ships are made of a hard, brittle plastic, and when you put the engines on, or pull them off, the teeth break, no matter how careful you are. The makers learned this and now provide the 4 rings upon request.Expanded by: Starfarers of Catan 5-6 Player Expansion; Starfarers of Catan Figures; good review: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/80837 Two player variant: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/file/info/16532

Is it just me, or is there more luck in Starfarers than there is in Settlers?  The event cards, the dice, and the ships contribute too much to a LONG game, making it too long to have so much luck.

Add my complaints to the choir about the ridiculously over-produced and flawed mother ship design: in the first use, one of the prongs on a mother ship snapped. This game is not exactly "Settlers in Space", but I like the more chaotic, rollicking nature of this game. I'm a fan and will gladly play it again. It's rating might improve with re-playing, or it might stay where it is. This is a good game, but maybe not a very good game.

This is fun, no doubt, and the theme beats vanilla Catan, but there are some annoying design flaws, such as the red-dot worlds being almost all pirate or ice worlds.  And it is just a tad too long for what you get.  But I'll play it.

Though this game lasts a long time, the theme is just too much fun.  This is a Catan resource-management, race game, with a space exploration theme.  It captures the feel of early space exploration computer games in which you collect resources, trade with aliens and race against other players to colonize planets.  I especially have fond memories of the gaming group making up stuff in place of the regular text for the encounters to spice up and personalize the game.

Played at bgg.con 2006. This was really fun. It's fun to explore and the game parts were all nice. I wonder how fun it is with multiple plays. I'm wondering if exploration is as fun later on, but the planets ARE set up randomly. So maybe that sweet sweet random reward will keep it fun. This was fun like Settlers, but with the added fun of combat, exploration, and SPACE.

My favorite of the Catans. Unlike the other Catans, it feels like you are always doing something and it doesn't bog down as quickly. As long as the inuendos don't get to you (and for some that's the best part of the game), it's an enjoyable game for everyone.

Played at BGG Con 2015. Definitely better than Catan but still suffers from some of the same problems due to randomness. The ships are a very interesting addition.

I do like this game... only complaint is that it is hard to introduce to new players with experienced plays playing as well... there are some things that you need to do to win and new players may not grasp those quickly enough... and the game is long so it can be painful sometimes to get through. Beautiful production (not mentioning ships breaking) and high geek factor with innovative shake the ship movement and number generation. Fun stuff but not played all that much anymore. For me the length of the game seems to detract from my enjoyment of the game - it outlasts its welcome - but it is a good game.

After 1 Play: The greatness of Catan, like Bohnanza, is how its few simple rules encourage trading between the players.  These simple systems aren't really suited to expansions, though the publishers continue to produce them.  Starfarers adds length and complexity to a system that can't support it, and makes for a less fun game.  That's not to say the game is bad, I just don't see any reason to play it over basic Settlers.

06/29/09 - A well-done expansion on the basic premise of the original Settlers.  Thematically well-executed and yet faithful to the original Settlers concept.  The game is longer, and waiting for your colony and trade ships to traverse the void of empty space can be a little trying, but otherwise the news systems all work nicely.  The encounters are definitely worth the price of admission alone.  I prefer the more compact and efficient game found in the original Settlers, but this is an excellent alternative.

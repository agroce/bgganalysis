A heavy dudes-on-a-map game. 3 on 1. The 3 invaders need to cripple the defender before his industrial juggernaut overwhelms them. This game really suffers from disparity of player skill.

It's been a long time since I played this, but I seem to remember it always feeling very one-sided (I think it was the United States that always seemed over powered, but again, it's been a while.)

* Note: Having read other people's thoughts, I'm thinking that the groups I was playing with must have blown since, apparently, this game is very balanced.

Fun game, but seems a little too scripted to offer much in the way of unlimited play scenarios.  Pondering some options for "house rules" to help open it up a little.

An all-time favorite. Picked this up in college at 25th Century Five and Dime in Bloomington, IN. Sadly, I don't think the store is there any more, but I spent a LOT of time and money there in the mid- to late- 80's. This game makes me happy. I have the Saddam cover.

WOW!!!!  That sums it up.  All that is good and right with Ameri-Trash is contained in one box.  It has awesome (and unbelievable) theme.  It has dice.  It has conflict.  It has cool plastic pieces.  It has hovercraft, lasers, and it has Wolverines!!!!

All coolness aside, this one has a real genius in how it plays out.  The "bad guys" (hmmm...they didn't break the treaty, did they?) have the big advantage early on, but America starts building her strength and as more lasers come online, the bad guys' spearhead gets shattered or else their supply lines can be decimated with a laser attack followed by the right strike.

So much to like about this game!

Can be fun, but suffers from the Axis and Allies problem of the game playing out similarly every time.  U.S. is dependent on strong reinforcement cards, enemies are dependent on dice.

3 vs 1. Add some random cards, add some limitations on dice rolling, draw a map, and we are ready to go.

Don't quite like Axis and Allies. Hate this even more.

But excellent production on the minis though.

RATING: N/A
Good theme play however unlikely the scenario.  Game is easy to learn and play, but grasping the tactics takes a few games.  Game play was very tense and is very well balanced.  The combat system is unique,uses different dice (D6, D8, & D10) combined with many units and some terrain, and very eloquent.  Rules are well written.  The components are excellent.

Wolverines!!!  Playing this game will take you back to the Cold War faster than "a shaken, not stirred" martini served from the galley of the Red October.

The original rules were not especially complicated and didn't provide a lot of variations in game play.  However, there's nothing like holding an invasion to Colorado border and then fighting your way back to Main St. USA.  So many sleepless slumber party nights were lost defending the homeland. If only I still had my copy.

RATING: 7.5
Gamemaster series, so nice bits are a given. This one is one of the better games from that series IMO. Invading countries have to be very aggressive and coordinate their actions in order to overcome the formidible lasers that eventually kick in for the US.

My personal favorite of the GameMaster series (Axis and Allies, Samurai Swords, and Conquest of the Empire are also in this series).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
An old style dicefest with lots of plastic pieces to worry about. With 3 people ganging up on the Americans it usually comes down to one make or break turn. If the the reinforcement  cards come in such a way to keep the Americans alive until the Invaders are out of reinforcements they will certainly win. A fun way to pass some time but there are other games out there more worthy.

I've got the pudgy-faced Saddam, looking a little like a cartoon dog, staring out at me, the expression on his face not the least concerned with the international global thermonuclear war. WHY ARE YOU WEARING A RUSSIAN BERET SADDAM?

Twin Towers right there as well. 

When do I drop this one on the kids' heads? I was in the 4th(?) grade when I saw Patrick Swayze say goodbye to his little brother, when Jennifer Grey's down stuffing popped out of her coat. Oh man, I didn't mean for this to get so heavy.

Don't play unless you're ready to commit 3 hours to defending your country. The balance in this game is amazing and results in a high tension game. The theme from matching colored units (Asians are yellow, Commies are red), US laser towers, and the reinforcement cards are pictures of 80's television screens "broadcasting" the events are in the game.

First Play: 4 Player game which needed a long rules explanation. The premise is good but the execution of the game dire. I played the invader from the west and spent over 3 hours advancing on a retreating enemy that only engaged in the last turn. To say the experience was turgid is an understatement. The game was put on e-bay the next day.

bought my original from Toys r us back in the day, took a whole paycheck from my first job, and then some. love this game, almost gave it a 10 just for nostalgia sake, but that would have been cheating, I will play this one every chance I get however, and would love to see MB revive the line (if not the original games) it was a good idea ahead of its time. If you get the chance play this one, its not too heavy, but with the right players, can be very thrilling, for all involved. mechanics hold up well actually. too many plays too long ago to be accurate, but there are some notes in the box, I'll post some soon.

07/02/10
Dropped it down to what I think is more accurate, I had just gotten it back in my possession after almost 15 years when I wrote the original. looking at the notes in the box, the current score more closely confirms this to me, still looking forward to some monster plays on this one.

RATING: 8.2
This old school light wargame from the MB Gamemaster Series has stood the test of time very well. The assymetrical nature of the game is just great fun. Despite three players playing against one, the game seems to be very well balanced. The stacking limit of five units together with the combined arms rules make this into a game where manoeuvering and troop management are very important. Frontal attacks don't work very well but to flank an oponent you need time to position yourself. And the more time you give the USA player the more chance he has to win. Probably better suited for two players as the individual winning conditions for the Invaders tend to weaken the alliance, giving the USA player an unfair advantage. Great components and one of the best rulebooks of the era.

The definitive Ameritrash game, it's always been a favorite (especially for someone who lists Red Dawn as a favorite movie).  I find the asymmetric game play engaging and am always drawn in by the high quality of the bits and board.  Steep learning curve and the demands placed on the U.S. player make this a hard game to find new players for.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
My favorite of Milton Bradley's Game Master series and one of my favorite games of all time. Nail-biting decisions on every turn. Even the set-up is critical: America can't defend too heavily forward, and the invaders must husband some heavy pieces for the final assault for that elusive 18th city. Just the slightest tweak will upset the balance of this game. If you enjoy "what-ifs" and don't mind the "light wargame" feel, you won't be disappointed by this.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.75
An unbalanced dicefest, but then that is exactly the idea. America is invaded from the south, east and west simultaneously and has to repel these attacks, or at least recapture some cities lost to the invaders. 

There's an initial balance of units 20,20,20 vs 60, but the invading powers start out with the power in the early game as they get more reinforcements early on (8 each per turn). However, the US tends to gain more after the first few turns, just as the invading powers reinforcments peter out. The invading player(s) need to rush for target cities to win early or else the US partisans and resupply of units will mean an inevitable defeat. 

And there's lasers.

I like this game. It's enteraining, though I think it would be much less good as a four player game than as a two player game.

I wish it took about half the time, however.

Fortress America is a near-future wargame premised on the idea that the rest of the world is going to attack America after it lets down its defences. It's very Axis and Allies inspired, though not identical by any means. Lots of bits, a neat board, and the American player gets to use partisans, a la Red Dawn!

Risk or A&A with some interesting twists. Lots of different sided dice - 3 invaders team up to invade America. Fun in its day and good for some beer and pretzels nostalgia if you can talk your friends into it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Plays best with 4 players. A futuristic hypothetical invasion of USA game.  The theme is not believable, but still fun game to play with my kids.  The turn sequence 1st Move/Combat/2nd Move (with several special rule exceptions for each phase) is unnecessarily complicated for this otherwise simple game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Won't appeal to those who don't like risk/axis and allies style conflict games - interesting spin on the many vs one concept. 3 invaders have to co-operate to take over America, but each wants to do a little better than the others. 2 player is uninteresting as the invaders just help each other with no risk of a backstab. 3 players is worse as one person gets 2 powers. Best as a 4 player ... helps if everyone knows the game and you play the early turns with all the invaders moving simultaneously.

With 3 others who like this genre I'd always be happy to play.

RATING: 6
A good 2 OR 4 player game to scratch the Gamemaster itch.  The best things about it are the playtime (lower than the others) and the combat system.

RATING: 7
This ended up being the weakest game out of the MB lineup.  I think the unit counters were a bit dull, and gameplay seemed to favor the US player.  Also, the whole let's team up to beat one player aspect wasn't very appealing.

I must say I enjoy this one more than Shogun. Play is fast and the tension really builds up. Will the US hold on to its 13 cities...? Play time is about 3-4 hours with 2 players which is good.

RATING: N/A
Brilliant asymmetric game from another era.  3 players are the "invaders", who are invading America.  The fourth plays America, defending the land of the free with partisans and lasers.  Yeah, lasers.  It is that awesome.  The game is well thought out and offers some really interesting decisions for both sides, as well as dice heavy combat and a boatload of plastic minis.  

The most interesting dynamic in the game (IMO) is that, by the rules, only one invader can win.  Together, the invaders have enough strength to overwhelm America, but just barely.  They must balance working together to defeat the USA with looking for a chance to steal a city out from under their "allies".  If they choose to ignore this dynamic, I think the game becomes a painful slog for the American player, and is not really that great.  But when the invaders are watching each other as closely as the USA, then it's great.

I have played solo once, and it was fun.  I'm looking forward to my kids being old enough to handle this one.

RATING: 5
Really interesting to play this one again. First impressions were that it's really not bad - pretty straight ahead design-wise, not a lot of innovation, but they managed to find a pretty good  spot where the game maintains tension levels and tactical interest through most of the play. Not bad, most US designers today can't manage even that fairly rudimentary accomplishment, so that's good. It's a decently fun game that goes on only a little bit too long and ends only a bit after it's over.

On second impression, one can't help but psychoanalyze the culture that produced this game. I mean, really. There is only one perspective in this game, the US, and the invaders really only play for their thematic amusement. The Americans have all the cool toys, all the strategic control, all the theme, all the narrative. The invaders get a bunch of interesting tactical problems to tackle, but let's face it, they play a thematically vacuous game. It's not that they're evil, or misguided, or psychopaths ... they're just complete non-entities for the US player to enjoy tormenting. The asymmetry here is quite striking, and a little disturbing, actually. Maybe I'm over-thinking this.

This leads to the third impression that wow, this was really a missed opportunity. Make the invaders more interesting and flavorful, give the game as a whole some narrative instead of just the US player, you might have something pretty cool instead of a workmanlike game with a faintly disturbing window into American culture.

I think at the end of the day, the MB folks who designed these games back in the 80s just weren't working with a lot of tools - buckets of dice, to-hit numbers, areas, move and attack - that's about it. They got lucky and made a few good games along with some really terrible ones. Fortress America is one of the better ones, but it's a low bar. I'll probably enjoying playing it again largely because of the car-wreck appeal of the theme, and because the tension is rather well managed.

RATING: 7.25
For an old Axis and Allies junky this game really hits the spot.  It's fun, it's fast enough, and has some epic moments.  There's two issues that keep me from giving it a higher rating:  I think there are balance issues in a 2 player game where the invaders don't turn on each other.  I also find that the laser decision space is somewhat rote if the invaders have bombers.  All in all this is a great old game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Not as significantly unbalanced in favour of the home team as people say.

Keep the bombers all together, away from your frontline cities, so they're not easy targets for lasers.  Don't take a city unless you can hold it.

Rated 7 after one two player game. I'm increasingly interested in "dudes on a map" type games, and this one is pretty good. I played the invading forces and got my arse handed to me, but in retrospect, I can see numerous mistakes that I made. I'm willing to try this one again.

This is the third of the MB big box series from the 80's .A similar level of complexiety and the detail that you might expect from Axis and Allies, but with more action and less early game scripting. The best of the three.

My friends and I used to play Fortress America even more than Axis & Allies, but as we've gotten older the reverse has become true. Although FA is a good game, the strategy becomes quite weak through repeated play. I still treasure this game, though.

A very clever idea... if only they could have been bothered to find a way to let the US win once in a while.  Crippled by bad balance, this game is actually quite fun.  Just assign the role of the US to the player who most likes being the underdog... and who is a good loser.  I would still play this... perhaps I should consider raising my rating?  But then, there are so many other games that are so much better.

In the futuristic world post WW III, the final invasion of America by the Communist powers is at hand.  This Milton Bradley original 1986 version is a great, fun game to play.  I really like this game as a two player game as it can be tense.  Likewise, if you have four good gamers around the table, Fortress America can be a really good four player game as well.  Lots of dice and special card events make the game twist and turn.  One moment you feel like your forces have had it as the American player and the next moment you've been brought back from the dead to keep the game alive. I love how tight this game can be when played with skilled players.  Fortress America tends to take about 5 hours with skilled players at the table - enough time for even a weeknight game after work!   This futuristic type war game has made my top 50 list of war games I enjoy playing of all time.

RATING: 7
I recently dusted off my circa 1986 copy of FA and gave it a whirl.  I think the game is fairly well balanced and is fun.  I like that the game system recognizes the notion of combined arms and rewards you for it.  The game requires the Invaders to rush the US as quickly as possible; in one game, the Invaders took 20 US cities late in the game but were too weak to hold them; the US took three of them back and built up partisan forces well behind enemy lines to eventually force the Invader to concede.  The game was bleak and all but lost to the US, but by tenaciously holding on, their lasers and partisans were able to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat.  I'm not a big fan of the movement mechanic as it's easy to lose track of which units move or not, and I think declaring combat can be a little clumsy, but the game is fun nonetheless.  I'm glad I tried it out again - it was fun rehashing a childhood classic!

Part of the 1986 MB Gamemaster Series.  I found it at a garage sale along with 2 other MG Gamemaster Series games, Axis & Allies, and Shogun, around the year 2000.  I paid $4 for each game.  That was my best garage sale find of the year.
I have played it twice.  1 player defends America against 3 invading players.  It's different.

Man, I just have to get this to the table in 2008!
OK - first play (5/24/2008) - definitely a fun and challenging game (especially for the USA player). Lasers are FUN! (Yes, I was the USA on this first play for our group).
Second play (7/6/2008) - this game is diabolical, in a good way! Just finished our second play. USA won again as Invaders imploded due to greed and suspicion regarding which Invader would come out on top after USA was finished! The victory conditions in this game are perfect and result in a finely balanced experience!

I finally got a chance to play this after owning it for almost 2 years.  Really enjoyed it.  Would love to play again to test different strategies.  Seemed very well balanced and play-tested.

I'm not sure I would consider this a go-to game, but I enjoyed myself despite (as the Americans) the end being a foregone conclusion long before we reached it.  I'm pretty certain that was all my fault since I am a n00b and had never played the game before.  So of course I volunteered to be the Americans because nobody else wanted to do the job, but that meant putting my head into the lion's mouth and boy, did I do a terrible job.  I mean, I sucked a fat one.  Trying to take cities back is a risky job and well, dice have to like you a little bit, like to the point of considering that maybe you might be a fun date, but really, they've been eyeing that nice sporty boy in Class 2 and they should probably hold off just in case they get a chance.  Still, if that doesn't work out, maybe they could get together with you.  They'll call their friends and see what they think.  They gotta like you like that.  They don't like -me- like that.  They totally wouldn't be caught seen with me even in the hallway, let alone working together for CAPITALISM!

...Where was I?

Oh yeah.  The game is tons of fun, but it is not for the bold man (or woman).  As the Americans, you really have to dial back your risk meter and not give it the ol' "what the hell".  So that particular role doesn't suit me since I love to take risks and I have "what the hell" tattooed just under my belly-button (that may or may not be true).  However, despite my inability to properly dial-in my attitude toward risk, I had a lot of fun and would play it again, perhaps not as the Americans... but then again, I feel I have to prove it to myself that I can win in that role.  I'll be better prepped for it next time.

So why isn't it a go-to game?  Well, you gotta be in the mood for it, for one, and two, it's long.  I can think of a few games about the same length that I would rather play only because I would feel the experience would be much more satisfying.  I have no problem with losing games; I lose them often, but it's no fun to play a game that isn't fun to lose.  Think about all the great games out there that you really like to play - how many times have you won and did not winning take away from the game?  That's how I feel about older titles - unless you're winning, you're just kinda there.

I made the same comparison when we played; I said, "I now know what it feels like to be the gazelle as lions are picking who gets what part."  You know, those pictures where the animal being eaten is clearly in distress, but for some reason looks totally bored as lions climb atop it.  Check out some lions hunting hippos pictures.  That's me.  The hippo.

Plays pretty much the same way every time, but I find it to be reasonably balanced, and it's always fun.  The invaders need to do some serious damage early in order to win: if it gets to the point where they are no longer receiving reinforcements, then it's only a matter of time before the USA wins.

RATING: 6
This is a fun light game, until you work out its basic flaw: there is no reason for the American player to defend most cities and there is no reason for the Invaders to capture most American cities, until the last possible moment. Why? Because if the American defends all the cities he will run out of units and never get any bonus reinforcements, which only appear when he RECAPTURES a city. And converely, Invaders should never capture a city until the very last instant, because they now have to defend them indefintely. Having the defender not defend and the attacker not attack just seems so wrong that most people stop playing when they reach that conclusion.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
In more ways than one this feels like a major influence on Friedrich.  The difference is largely in combat resolution and theme.  Thematically I prefer this.  Fortress America has a built in timer - the Americans get stronger, the Invaders get weaker, so the invaders need to strike fast.  Fortress America  has different unit powers - infantry/vehicles/airplanes which each attack with a different dice.  There is also a nice addition of a combined power bonus which aids invaders and helps govern strategies. Fortress America is a fun mid-weight wargame that is heavy on theme.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The premise is great. The components are great. The rules are clear. THe game is l-o-n-g. Though the length is not its weakness, it is the downtime between turns for the invaders. It's a game that is fun to reach the table about once a year.

The best of Milton Bradley's GameMaster series. The setup conditions give it more replay value than the set-piece start of Axis and Allies without the unbalanced conditions that random territories create in many wargames. Best with two players, or with invaders who cooperate well. The game will favor the US if the invaders compete with each other (let alone /fight/ each other) but is balanced when they cooperate.

This is a blast.  Superior to Axis & Allies.  Somebody needs to re-make this one for today.  I love the asymmetric challenge.  The Americans are pathetic to begin with, and must choose their battles carefully.  The Invaders start strong, but attrition slowly wipes out all their best stuff.

Hilarious theme, but a very tense gaming situation. 

Fortress America is an artifact of its time. Historians, sociologists, anthropologists, and others could find much to talk about just by looking at the game cover. Ah, but playing it is where you’ll really come to love it. Best of all, you don’t have to like or watch Red Dawn to “get it.” What do I get out of the game, beyond the fun? Let’s just say since 1945 Americans have been a quest for an enemy to vanquish. We’ve declared war on communism, poverty, drugs, and terrorists to name but a few. I’d say this mentality has done us more harm than good, but at least it gave us Fortress America.

I think one thing is missing from the game's plot: a Jimmy Carter presidential victory in 1980. How else do you explain the solar panels!

I’ll leave with some wisdom from Sylvester Stallone:

"We just happened to come along at the right time. This country has needed to flex its muscles again. You might say America has gone back to the gym...I think the intelligentsia should understand that this country now is functioning on emotional energy more than intellectual energy...President Reagan has provided this country with a lot of incentives to feel better. When you think about what it was coming off of with the last three presidents, Reagan has been a godsend. The country’s esteem is on the rise."

RATING: 5
Middle of the road for the Gamemaster series.  Not as good as Shogun or even Axis & Allies, though definitely better than the first two games of the series.  I loved the partisan cards, but overall the game was too slow to develop, poorly balanced, and very limited in strategic options.

RATING: 6
Enjoyable game with cool plastic tanks and stuff. It doesnt really work unless you have 4 players. One to defend America and the other three to attack it from three different coasts.

I haven't played this for 20 years. It's hard to get the old Milton Bradleys on the table with so much new junk out these days.

I love all of the old Gamemaster series games (Heaven help me). I just cannot help it they are all just plain FUN. I cannot think of a more American game than Fortress America. Three sides of America are attacked and the good Ol' USA must defend itself against the Communist (and presumably socialist) hordes. Just a great dice fest with hover tanks! Answer the call defend to your homeland or to conquer the evil that is America you choose.

As Axis and Allies, there are only two strategies you can use, if you don't, you lose the game.

2 players game actually, don't be fooled. And quite boring, you play once and you have seen everything the game has to offer.

Like Axis and Allies, stay away from that one.

It is innovative, has a brilliant theme, an excellent production value.
A great, great game that is fun, fun and there are games like these missing these days. Who dares to publish a successor? FFG?! 
The only backdraw is that it fails somewhat in it's execution as it is limiting the available choises.
What Braveheart is with Hammer of the Scots, is Red Dawn (go Patrick Swayze!) to Fortress America. Now that the twin towers and saddam are history, this game becomes the ultimate classic of all games for me.

Great fun every once in a while.

A+ almost a perfect 10!

Outstanding Game (always want to play it and expect this will never change)

The absolute best of the old Milton Bradley "Game Master Series". Far better mechanics and balance than, say, the far better known Axis & Allies.

I didn't fully appreciate the genius of these rules back in the 1980s but I'm seeing more and more depth and elegance each time I play it and it's quickly become one of my very favourite games!

Great Mechanics that are simple but really enhance play: Order of Casualties, different dice sizes and colours for different units, combined arms, etc. a lot of the latest games could learn a thing or two from this one. 

Great Balance: almost every game is too close to call, and each game you learn something new as do your opponents and you have to adapt to their new strategy as they adapt to yours.

Some people can't get over the cheeziness of the theme but you need to sit them down with a 6-pack of Duff in front of Red Dawn to give them the flavour of 80s Kapitalist anti-red paranoia.

If only Eagle Games would re-release it with a gazillion pieces and a big-assed map that included all the US states and Canadian provinces to give it more of the scope of Invasion: America.

Played this a dozen or so times in high school, however I didn't get into this one as much as I did with A & A.  It is in fact fun, however it takes so much time to play and the US alwasy seemed to win as I remember.  It takes a lot of time to commit to play as you will spend hours reading and figuring out a strategy.  Play with people in your skill level (beginners only, etc) otherwise you will find it not so enjoyable.  It does take a long time to play.  If you stay on task it will probably take 4-5 hours.  With that said that time is rare as it alwasy takes our group longer.  If you can make it through all of the above, I would still recommend giving this a game play for those war game strategist.

Only play the game with 2 players.  It is very balanced, with both thinking they will lose for a long time until finally one side starts to pull away (Usually the US on the last reinforcments turn for the invaders).  US strategy must be to have some choppers and tanks die during the initial invasion so they are available on his first turn.

This game is for anyone who grew up during the height of the Cold War where nuclear armageddon could happen Any Day Now.  Reminds me of Red Dawn.  Who doesn't shout "Wolverines!" after defending against a foreign attack? Not much of a fan of wargames however, but it is still fun because of the 80s theme.  I first played this well after the Cold War was over.

All in all, I was a little disappointed.  I purchased A & A and Shogun when I was younger and loved them, but at the time was never able to find Fortress America. I had built the game up in my mind as a 10 year old, and while I probably would have loved it then, it just didn't live up to expectations playing it for the first time as an adult.  The choices seemed limited and the downtime seemed very long.  While this is not a bad game and I could see myself enjoying it if in the right mood, it is not a game I would elect to play very often.  If I wanted to play this type of game I'd play Shogun or HoTW instead.  It definitely seems to be the weakest of the Gamemaster games I've played so far.

RATING: 6
Initial rating based on one play: 6. This game seemed well-made for what it is: a dicefest with carefully calibrated balance, deep movement options, and drawn-out attrition. It certainly has an interesting tension, with the invaders forced to smash inland as quickly as possible while still attempting clever tactics. There are only 8-9 turns to crush the American resistance, after which America finally catches it's footing and wipes the invaders from the map. I rate this a six because I'm not sure I want to play this type of game for three hours (I much prefer the brisk pacing of Memoir 44). Also, the much vaunted theme and atmosphere of the game seemed to boil down to 1.) quoting Red Dawn ("Wolverines!"), 2.) Quoting Under Siege 2: Dark Territory ("Boom! Earthquake in mid-air"), 3.) Occasionally re-reading aloud excerpts from the "background" and cracking up (all of the oil seeps out of the Persian Gulf after a nuclear device is detonated), and 4.) Jokes about cities that have to be taken or defended because of personal value, or that can be left undefended because of personal dislike. I'm not sure that really qualifies as thematic over three hours. On some level it's just unexciting looking at a flat map of the United States with some mountain sections. I'd like to play again at some point to get a better sense of the game. Rating may eventually go up.  

In some ways this is a tight package, but if I wanted to scratch the large-scale strategic combat itch, I'd rather play a big Battletech scenario with the added complexity of weapons load-outs, armor ratings, terrain, etc. etc. I'm predisposed to view FA's gameplay as a bit narrow.

One tense game!  A really interesting situation where the Invaders have the advantage of numbers and equipment, but the United States slowly grows in power since it can (somewhat) replace its losses and use its lasers to thin the intruding hordes.  The mechanics work very well and have some subtleties to them which give the different types of units a distinct feel.  While it does not have a set time limit, the growing power of the US lasers and reinforcements means that the Invaders either win by a certain point or run out of units.

I find it very difficult to actually beat the American player if they know what they are doing. This has unique strategy elements, no other game like it, with supply lines and every player against one, plus a high water mark (so to speak) in every game. Its fun because its dripping with theme and fun to gang up while looking out for your own interests. Only problem with this game is the American player most likely wins every time, especially if they're good at it.

I remember reading an interview with Michael Gray (the designer) where he said that this was his favorite game, due largely to its perfect balance.  It does seem well-balanced to me, the invaders really need to pick when to work together and when to fall on each other over the spoils.  I always liked it, you have two sides that start the same but over the course of the game the American player evolves into a very different force with partisans, lasers and event cards.  Elegant, clear rules with lots of examples, I'd forgotten until writing this how good those rules were.

Fortress America, originally part of Milton Bradley's Gamemaster series, depicts an alternate near-future in which all of the world attacks and invades the continental United States. From the west arrives hordes of Asian foes; from the south arrives a union of South American countries through Mexico, and from the east lands come legions of Soviets who have taken over all of Europe. America besieged has to rely on the remaining ground and air forces left in the country along with partisan uprisings to defend mom's apple pie.

Fortress America was an interesting game back when it was first released.  More balanced in my opinion than Axis and Allies but somewhat less enjoyable gameplay.  This game is better multiplayer than two player as the gameplay can bog down if the invader player is beset by AP.

RATING: 8
This is a classic asymmetric four-player wargame that will also handle two- or three-player counts (just assign multiple invaders to one player). In addition to the radically different "attack" vs "defend" objectives of the invaders vs the US, each invader faces a very different set of initial defenders and terrain considerations.

And, as an added bonus (and an unusual case for the Gamemaster Series), there's a functional endpoint to the game. Like Risk, Axis and Allies can drag for days. FA, though, shuts off the reinforcement pipeline for the invaders after 6 turns. They will either win shortly after or run out of troops.

Disappointed with this one.  Lack of variability and strong luck factor means you may as well just roll some dice to see who wins then play something else instead.  Neat bits though, but only four colors means you are limited in making your own games out of them.  Five would have been appreciated.

Modern/semi-futuristic game in which the US angers the whole world and then has to defend all of its national borders from their invasions (barring the North since jolly old Canada decides to stay neutral). One player is the US, while the other 1 - 3 players are the invaders. The invaders are on a clock.  So, unless they capture 18 cities, they will run out of troops and the US will prevail. It's like a board game version of the movie Red Dawn.

Neat to have a theme that has America as the battleground.  The supply chain effect kind of sucks, but I guess it makes it more balanced.

Seems like it was designed so the American player has an advantage to win.  I haven't played enough to confirm this.

RATING: 7
Played a tweaked version to make for numerous very, very close and tense games.  Great as a two player game.  My favorite of the gamemaster series (probably due to the number of players more than anything else).  It is a dicefest, and that is fine, but there is a bit of downtime (esp. with more than 2 players).  Rulebook has nice examples, but goes into painful detail on very simple concepts.  Still, all in all, it is a game I have played many times through the years and will bring it out from time to time.

Update:  broke it out and taught P & A.  P lost interest quickly.  A did okay, but didn't really like the game.  Guess it will sit on the shelf some more. That's sad for me, best of the MB games from the 80s

I think this is a great game.  Love the pieces and the theme.  Almost always comes down to a make-or-break turn late in the game.  An experienced US player should win, absent abnormally poor partisan card selection and abnormally good rolling by the invaders.  Try the variant that makes it harder for lasers to hit bombers/helicopters to even it up a bit.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I have no idea if the new version is better, but the old version is really good, so I don't care.

The two-player experience using the old system is some quality gaming. In addition to inspiring overuse of exclamation points, it is just good, old-fashioned AmeriTrashy fun! It's the sort of game you can point to in lieu of trying to "explain" or "define" AmeriTrash. 

The components are fun, the factions are fun, the rules are pretty simple to learn but game play is reasonably deep. Based on limited play, it looks like there are some definite trends and tendencies that will develop. However, you have a fair amount of freedom to try some different tactics, to make feints, to try blitzkrieg or broad front approaches, etc.

I never played this back in the day, but I have played many games from that era and this era. This one stands up to today's best and is worth picking up. From what I've heard of the new edition, the only reason for picking it up instead would be the size of the box. This old thing is big in every way and worth the storage space if you've got it.

RATING: 6.5
An interesting game with some risk-like elements... though quite a bit more complex. After playing a number of times, the winning strategy for the U.S. is fairly simple: Simply survive as long as you can. The longer it takes for the invading armies to beat you, the more likely victory is for you as you begin to place more laser towers. Now, this sounds a lot easier than it actually is... I've only ever seen the U.S. player win once out of a dozen or so games, and it was a memorable occasion. :)

Gripes: Takes a looong time to play, several hours. Plus, the difficulty of playing the U.S. can be a bit daunting. Plus, a single run of bad dice rolls can completely doom a player, diminishing the overall fun factor.

I really loved playing this game back when I was in High School, especially after watching Red Dawn.  While the game was a blast to play my friends and I always felt that the game was slanted heavily in favor of the Americans.  We all cycled through playing the various factions and America would wind up winning about 60-75% of the time.  Still, it was tons of fun and I would love to play it again, espcially since I haven't played it in about 20 years.

Played this game a long time ago (when I was in middle school).  It is a great breather from Axis & Allies.  Everytime I play it I think of the movie "Red Dawn."  Fast play, easy rules, loads of pieces, it makes for a great game.  I'm not giving it a 10 because sometimes the game got really frustrating, especially for the attackers (the guys invading America).  But hey, its a dice game, so it all really depends on the luck of the die.  Great game though.

A "parts" copy:

- missing original printed rules book (pdf copy in box).

- nearly 2 complete set of military units for all factions.
- extra cities and Laser SATs.
- 2 game boards.
- 2 player aid cards.
- complete set of USA partisan cards in "like new" condition.
- Saddam guy box cover art.
----------------------------------------------------------

This and Shogun/Samurai Swords/Ikusa are imo, the best of the MB Game Master series (not a fan of Axis & Allies).

Excellent asymmetric setup and good mesh of simple game mechanics and theme.  A classic of the Ameritrash game genre and appropriately so since this game is the definitive example of that type of game.

Seems to be finely balanced if played with 4 players.  Command friction between the various invading forces is both entertaining and helps to balance the game.

Good implementation of basic wargame mechanics in a well produced package.  Plays well, looks good, and has held up over the years both in terms of component quality, graphic design and gameplay.  At least in my admittedly biased opinion as I do like this game best of all in the MB Gamemaster Series.

This perennial and genre-defining game is not without it's flaws, but we had a blast playing it. Takes a WAY longer than it should for what it is, there's far too much downtime between player turns, and things are fairly reliant on dice rolls, but in the end none of these complaints really mattered. What mattered is that we destroyed each other and had a laugh.

This game only really shines when have the full four players.  When you can manage that, it should always be a game to consider for your time.  I love the theme of America on the defensive against invading armies, and this was the first game I can remember that had cards to really change the scope of the board out of the blue (though only for America, who needs the help anyway).  Doesn't get a higher rating because if the invaders roll lights-out in the initial few rounds and America's lasers don't hit with regular accuracy, the American player just wasted a couple of hours for nothing b/c they will be wiped out quickly.  However, this is not the norm so it's still a great game to play.

A reimplementation of a classic game from the 80s. Pretty fun dice chucker for kids and teens. The theme is also pretty unique. If the Americans can hold out for long enough, the war will turn in their favor; the invaders need to score an early victory to have any chance.

Played this game 20+years ago. Played again and was impressed with the game. It works especially well with four players as the three invaders work together to defeat the US player while positioningnthemselves for an individual win. A wise US player can use this against them. A good game, much better than I remembered.

RATING: 2
This is not only the worst of the GameMaster series, but it is a lousy war game in and of itself. The game "balance" is too severly stacked in favor of the Americans. The pieces are contrived and the premise, boring. Not worth the time spent. Probably have logged 30+ hours in my teenage lifetime as one group after another tried to "convert" me. Finally, I cut my losses. For its time, I do like the oddly prophetic addition of "Saddam Hussein" to the box cover artwork; Not sure if that was intentional...

Purchased this on Dec 19, 2015 on Ebay for only $31.80 ($25.00 + $6.80 shipping).  It is in amazingly good condition!  Many of the pieces are still on sprue and un-punched.  I originally purchased it for a friend as a gift.  I ended up holding on to it for a long time to find the right time to give it to him and a good time really didn't present itself.

I ended up buying him another copy for even cheaper on May 29, 2016 on Ebay for $25.25 ($12.50 + $12.75 shipping).  It too is in amazing quality!  In many ways it is in better shape than the first copy I bought.

To find 2 complete and pristine copies of a 30+ year old game (at the time of this entry) for $57 is amazing!  So, I'm keeping the first copy for myself and giving the second copy away.

Suspenseful entry into the MB Gamemaster Series.  The invaders have only so much time to capture a set number of American cities -- every game I have played has always been close.  Even still, its appeal for me is not as great as Conquest of the Empire and Axis & Allies.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
I'm a heathen, but I didn't like the game.  I disliked the fact that the three invading forces could not share spaces.  I also disliked the fact that if you did not squash the Americans quickly, the lasers and the partisans started popping out of the woodwork. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
What can I say? This is a gem of the gaming world. Nothing will ever combine the level of charm, playability, excitement, and nostalgia that "Fortress America" brings to the gaming table. The thrill I feel while defending my home state with a single partisan unit is something that I've never been able to recreate. "Saddam Hussein" edition. Box slightly caved, but he artwork is undamaged. All booklets/instructions. One Soviet reserve infantry was always missing, but it can easily be replaced from the pile of dead infantry resulting from the massive amphibious landings near D.C.!

I really love this game, and it's my favorite out of old the Axis & Allies, Fortress America, Shogun triad (revised Axis & Allies probably beats it). The rules are simple, yet emphasize the necessity of combined arms and supply lines. The finite invader reinforcements impose a distinct time limit -- if they haven't won by the end of the sixth turn, it's time to call it quits.

Great looking game and kudos to the production team. Shows its age in the time it takes to complete a session and the associated down time between player turns.

My cousin owned this game as a kid while I had A & A. We played each dozens of times during our teen years. We loved the high quality pieces that Milton Bradley produced for their Gamemaster Series, simply the best war games of the time. Fortress America seems like a strange concept in the post-Cold War era, but it was spot on for the 80's ever-present concern with nuclear proliferation. I recently purchased my own copy of this vintage game with the hopes of reliving some wonderful childhood memories.

It's cool how the game plays out:  all-out invasion of America followed by the gradual attrition of the invaders (thanks, in part, to some frickin' lasers).  However, it takes for too long for my tastes and can end in anticlimax.

This game is probably the most fun of all the Gamemasters because it's part defend against invasion, part SciFi, part Red Dawn (the movie) with partisans and other reinforcements popping up behind invader's line according to the card draw. It is both entertaining and offers decent strategic challenges and options.

Lots of dudes on a map, classic Ameritrash. It's not brain surgery but there is real skill in managing the invaders and even more skill in handling America. With 2 players, it's probably 60/40 favor the invaders; with 4 players, it's more like 40/60 (because of invader squabbling).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
By far the most played of my Gamemaster games.  Finely balanced, and a few turns in you reach a tipping point.  If the invaders haven't won by that point, they are done for.  Unfortunately, the game continues for several more turns of pointlessness.  Calling the game early might bring it to an 8, but I'm not giving the point for something I had to fix.

Classic Ameritrash.  The best of the Gamemaster series; I find that the variable placement gives better replay value than A&A.  The sides are fairly well-balanced; the game seems to come down to a close finish consistently.  Besides, you get to zap enemy bombers with lasers!  What more can you ask?

As wargames go, one of the faster and more unique ones out there.  Most games tend to play out similarly as there's really one correct strategy for the American player.  The game tends to be dictated by the dice gods, but it's a surprisingly good time.

RATING: 8.5
An absurd background set in the early 21st century where the rest of the world get so angry with America they ally together and attack it from all sides (or at least it seemed absurd when this was produced), this is my favourite of the MB Gamesmaster series. We&#039;ve found the game is balanced slightly in favour of the Americans after repeated playings, but the reinforcement rules can be easily tweaked to fix this. A great game in every way.

RATING: 6
Light asymmetrical wargame of Cold War paranoia: one player takes America, beset on three fronts by 1-3 opponents controlling the three Invaders. The arc of the game is that the Americans reinforce slowly, but destroyed troops can be rebuilt; invaders build up faster but lose troops permanently. The first half sees the Americans playing defensively, fleeing the red (and yellow and blue) tide; if pushed hard enough, they lose. If they survive, the tide eventually turns.

The real problem is that it only really gets interesting at the fulcrum. Have the Invaders pushed hard enough, or will the Americans survive long enough to turn it around? It's 2+ hours buildup/denouement for half an hour of climactic gold.

The system itself is relatively simple, but with surprising nuance -- notably, a simple CRT which encourages "combined arms" (one each of infantry, mechanized units and air), and some wrinkles around pre- and post-combat movement phases. While not the sort of thing I would expect to like, it does work well. If you need a 'trashy light wargame, you could do a lot worse. This one deserves its classic status.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
An oldie but a goodie, takes a few hours and depending on the players, America survives or fails if the attackers know what they are doing and the routes to take.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A very enjoyable light war game with an interesting and novel idea; the United States is invaded on 3 fronts and must protect major cities from occupation by the invaders.  The best thing about this game is that it always is tight right down to the end if you have equally skilled players.  I also like the combat system and the idea of combined arms.  The game features enough strategy for my tastes without being overwhelming.  The only minor complaints I have is that game length can be just a little too long and some of the rules regarding movement and combat are a little unclear.  Otherwise a very good game, and this is coming from a person who does not really like Axis and Allies at all.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Good theme play; however, an unlikely scenario.  Game is easy to learn and play, but grasping the tactics takes a few games.  Game play is very tense and very well balanced (asymetrical between factions).  The combat system is unique, uses different dice (D6, D8, & D10) combined with many unit types and some terrain, and very eloquent.  Rules are well written.  The components are excellent - colorful mounted board & plastic playing pieces.  Game length is about 3 hours, and feels right.

Had it as a kid, had the fortune to re-play just a few years ago- the game is more interesting for historical reasons than in its gameplay.  Guaranteed to make the loser utterly frustrated:  either they've watched their American troops get utterly destroyed on the eastern seaboard in the first 5 turns, or the invaders watch their western supply lines and eastern ground-stall crumble under laser zaps.

The premise is way over the top. At the time I bought this we were still interested in modern warfare, but wanted a simple “beer and pretzel” game as a break from the hardcore.

I've played this game about 6 times. I used to think America always won. Last two times I've played as USA I've been spanked. A lot of luck in this game. If you don't get the right cards, if your dice rolling isn't up to snuff - then it's over. However, there are some cool innovations here - like bonus for combind arms and different dice for different units. Plus, the mins are darn cool.

RATING: 8.5
This, is my favorit of the lot! Axis is all well and good but this is da Bomb. You heard me, da Bomb.
It is a funny little background, based on the communist taking over the world and the attacking USA. With cute little miniature cities with skyline and everything.
The use of different dice is a nice touch. And the one round, defender fires first combat system is extreamly exciting to play with. You never know if a battle will go you way. And the partisan cards not only adds flavor but also opens up for playing a defenders strategy partly based on the chanses of getting certain cards. And it forces the three attackers to cooperate and garrison heavily or risk their entire game.
Also heard over a game:
"Wohoo, major airlift, here I come!"
"I disrespect your mobile infantery"
"Nooo!!! I got the bomber card!"

Upon one play of this 1 on 1 I discovered certain things.  I will admit that I lost as America, there seems to be some serious flaws though.  I dislike so called start games where theres things cut in stone, this one seemed to be loaded with them.  The soviets pretty much get hosed, America wins as soon as they get enough lasers, America should abandon the west entirely.  It really didn't seem balanced and I cant see it being much fun to play over and over.  It took me a few seconds to realise the error I made with my original unit placement, that lost me the games.  It also seems very luck heavy, sad really, it had a cute theme

A great game. It is however unbalanced, but still lots of fun to play. The reason I only give it an 8 is due to comparing it to the other games in the Game Master series. It reminds me of the movie Red Dawn which I loved. I am looking for the board to this game due to water damage to the one I own.

I tapped out on Risk type rollers years ago. I don't get stoned and sit in the dorm doing repetitive stuff like this anymore. There just isn't any surprise in rolling the 100,000th dice to see what comes up.

Asynchronous factions, the invaders taking cities & keeping them; the American's must take calculated gambles, with militia & the Star Wars lasers, to retake cities and find a foothold in the West or South or the riptide will pull them under.

Fun with the right people & in the spirit of Red Dawn. 

Alternative/post-apocalypse history is attractive, but couldn't overcome the Risk-like play.

As a kid who loved the Movie, Red Dawn, Fortress America was a great game to play with my two brothers and switch sides and such. I think that neither side is unbalanced as you'll see and read often on game boards for FA. Really, it's more, in my opinion, the luck of the dice since a '1' makes the Attackers and Defenders retreat. I've won numerous times with both Invaders and the US, but the game like A&A gets repeatative, and if the US has a hot roll with his lasers and the ten sided die midgame, then the Invaders are doomed. A 8 game 15 years ago. . .a 7 today because of the solid strategies that have been cultivated over the years to streamline and stregthen this classic

Fortress America is part of Milton Bradley's Gamemaster series. Fortress America depicts an alternate near-future in which all of the world attacks and invades the continental United States. From the west arrives hordes of Asian foes; from the south arrives a union of South American countries through Mexico, and from the east lands come legions of Soviets who have taken over all of Europe. America besieged has to rely on the remaining ground and air forces left in the country along with partisan uprisings to defend mom's apple pie.

So much better than I remember it from being a kid. Back then, I had no concept of anything and thought Axis & Allies was good. Now that I examine this game, I am amazed at how well balanced it is. The US wins probably 55-60%, but its always razor thin. The issue often becomes whether or not their reinforcement cards get wasted, which is kind of sad, but does not significantly detract from gameplay.

RATING: 7
Creepy, what with the extremely jingoistic tone of the theme and even of the introduction, but a pretty good game nonetheless.  If you can manage to get past the flag-waving and see to the lighter nature and into the absolute ridiculousness of the situation, it's a neat play.  The attacking rules are neat, clearly derived from games like fellow Gamemaster Series member [gameid=98], but the twist of being able to temporarily go over the stacking limit if you attack from two or more countries make it feel more unique than just another clone.  The dynamic of slow retreat, coupled with opportunistic attacking for the Americans is the type of just hold 'em off defense game that always appeals to me.  This is not just a kids game, rather this is a pretty solid medium to light wargame.  Just, please, make sure you don't buy too much into the theme.

My personal favorite of the Gamemaster series.  Awesome production quality and very solid gameplay with combined arms, endangered supply lines, and frontlines that waver back and forth,  In fact, this is probably one of my top favorite war boardgames of all time due to its countdown feel.  The Invaders, with their large but ever shrinking reinforcements, must race across the map to strike down the weaker American player whose ever growing never ending reinforcements will eventually overwhelm them if given long enough while the American player must do all he can to stall and delay the enemy advance.   I love this game.

A classic boardgame that pits a crumbling United States of America against a horde of invading forces. The game is unique in that the invaders have a very limited number of troops and they do not replenish when they are lost in combat. The U.S. starts out undermanned, but slowly gains troops and weapons as the game goes on. Essentially, the invaders are on the clock and the U.S. just has to hold out until the invasion runs out of steam.

The game has held up surprisingly well over the years. I introduced my 11 year-old son to it, and he absolutely loved it. I did too. It was just as much fun playing it with him as it was when I was playing it in my buddy's basement in high school. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't surprised!

The only problem I see when looking at the game with a modern eye is that it really does need four players to work. I had fun going up against the youngster, but I think that the U.S. is at a distinct disadvantage if there is not infighting occurring amongst the allies. Only one invader can win, so at some point they each have to pause their assault on the northern cities and fight each other for dominance. In a two player game, that doesn't have to happen...so it's a little unbalanced in a head to head match-up.

Still, it's considered a classic for a reason and I'm glad I finally found an affordable copy after all these years.

Update: My comments refer to 1st edition, but the second edition from Fanatasy Flight is almost identical other than a tweaked map and an easier to resolve combat system. In other words, my thoughts apply to both editions...

I don't generally like this style of game, but this was better than I'd guessed it would be. The combined arms combat rules are interesting (and force you to use your infantry wisely, rather than as bait to allow your other units to steamroll through), and I like the built-in rules about ending the game by mutual agreement after 5 turns. Still, I would've liked it a lot more if it could reasonably play in an hour.

My favorite of the GameMaster series.  Love the theme, the decisions are interesting, and I like asymmetric "one vs. them" situations.  I don't care for the small number of reinforcement cards for the US (some predictability is nice, but the notion of planning around what ought to be fairly chaotic outbursts isn't quite right). Mostly related, I also find it a bit samey from game to game.

The balance complaints are just wrong: it's fine as is, with a slight edge to the US player, and very elegant means of handicapping to taste.

[i]Fortress America[/i] gets props for being an early many-against-one game (the first?), but there's not much else to enjoy.  The Red player keeps the Americans busy until some other invader wins, or the 'mericans hold out (for hours! the agony!) and spit in the face of the rest of the world.  That's OK, of course, because non-US countries are NOT the greatest, whereas we clearly ARE the greatest. (If that's an inaccurate statement, my local armed services recruiter has some serious explaining to do.)

I'm self-refective enough to realize that I would have loved this as a kid, which is why FA is the very definition of a nostalgia game.  You liked it then, but stay away if you're over 30.  Fond memories should be cherished, not broken.

I really like this game.  It's a total slaughter from the get go for the US, but if you can hang in there... the tide will quickly turn.  The game can draw out quite a bit and there is a lot of downtime for the aggressors.  The US has a bit of downtime as well, but at least he's involved during the other players turn... if you count removing your pieces from the board as 'involved'.  As with Axis & Allies, there is a high luck factor involved here... which, for me, keeps it on a lower peg.

A game that I never played as often I would have liked in my high school and college years.  I like the fact that it has a mechanism that makes the game end unlike most games of Axis and Allies.

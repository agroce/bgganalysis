It wants to be Space Alert perhaps? This is a co-op with lack luster illustrations and graphic design. The concept is adequate, but lends itself to player mistakes and confusion as player turns are simultaneous. There is a small amount of tension along the way, and I do appreciate the timer flipping mechanic. But over all, rather bland. Not a game I'm likely to play again.

(Sold to make room on my shelves.)

I'm going to give this one a 6 after one play, just for the seeming hopelessness of the scenario.  This may go up with more plays as we get better, though!

Update:  We played a few more times, even even won once!  I'm going to keep this one at a 6, though, since it seems like the scenario options for my 3-4 player group are very limited.  I don't see it getting much more play.

Loved it!  I can't wait to play again.  I thought the "action then wait then action then wait" aspect would bother me but the challenge of figuring out what your action should be was enough to fill that time and keep the suspense going.

One of my most disappointing Kickstarters to date. The premise is good, but in practice the timing mechanic just doesn't work for me. The idea that it is in realtime, but your turns are regulated by time also, creates this hurry up and wait aspect of play that I can't stand. In stead of feeling like I am in a high stress high speed race for victory it feels like in in rush hour traffic. No thanks, I get enough of that already.

Someone noted this was a "better" Space Alert.  I highly disagree and found that it took the worst aspects of Space and Time, with random pick up and deliver mechanisms to bring X/Y/Z goods to repair.

Fine if you want something light that has no repetition, but if you want a true real time cooperative game, play Space Alert.

The one problem with this game is that it is essentially worker placement where you can double the number of your workers by keeping the life support high. It is hard to balance that. If you are able to maintain life support, the game is kind of easy, if not, the game is nigh impossible. 

Still, a very fun experience and I would definitely play it a few more times.

First up, I mostly play co-ops two player and this game has exactly one scenario which lists two players as a possibility, and it requires a bit of luck and a very specific (repetitive, dull) strategy in order to beat it.

Second, sitting watching your sand timer isn't fun, and if you look at the board, resolve a damage report, or make plans with the other players, you'll likely lose time because you won't notice that your sand timer has run out. So, the solution is to sit there staring at your sand timer. Which is boring.

Third, when an action takes up possibly one minute of real time to complete, moving from one room to another, when you might need to move four rooms before doing anything, well that's a long time to be staring at your sand timer and doing what is, let's be honest, a not particularly exciting action.

Fourth, the entire game is haul things from crates to repair spots, repair, repeat, and every three minutes the work you've been doing gets undone to some extent.

Finally, I've played Escape and Space Alert, and they are both way better when it comes to frantic real time co-op fun. All three are fiddly, but neither of the others have me staring at a piece of game equipment instead of planning moves with my partners or, I don't know, actually doing something (looking at the board, playing cards, rolling dice...).

They are also, both, shorter games. Escape is actually playable with two because they have scaling rules. Neither of them has the game undoing my accomplishments. 

With those two games in existence, I can't see why I'd pick Damage Report for my sparse board game playing time.

While it is a neat idea with the turns based in real time using egg timers, it is just boring.  There isn't enough to do or think or argue about each minute while you wait for your turn to come around.

I'm not a big fan of co-op games, specifically because a leader often emerges who controls the game and plays for everyone. Having one player control the game is literally impossible in Damage Report - there isn't enough time!

This intense, fast-paced real-time co-op challenges you and your friends to repair your ship in a race against time. Everyone takes simultaneous turns every 30 seconds or so, giving you just enough time to assess your own situation and plan a strategy for yourself.

Since you don't have enough time to look at what everyone else is doing, you simply MUST work together as a team to survive and win each scenario. Players shout to each other what they need, prioritizing as well as they can with the limited information they possess.

I've never felt so immersed in a game as when playing Damage Report. By far the best co-op game I have ever played.

This is the best entry so far in the real - time frantic turnless genre, in my opinion. Similar challenges to Red November, with mechanics similar to Space Alert and Space Dealer plus a theme that's a loving homage to Star Trek.

Sounds really interesting but I wonder if 45 minutes is too long for this type of game. In the video people said it was 'fun', I didn't notice that aspect coming out as much as one would think though, people are just very 'busy' trying to get stuff done (which is one of the reasons SA has the 'resolving' phase, a chance for everyone to laugh at what happened where here you don't have the time) 

My impression is it won't replace SA, but does look like an interesting co-op that like SA, solves the dominant player issue and will also have good tension. Definitely like the modular ship and different scenario setup which are both improvements over SA

I like co-ops.  I don't like timed games.  The timer mechanism works like Time & Space, but somehow it didn't seem as bad.  That's faint praise.  When we lost life support in one game and had to cycle through many phases, it did get pretty bad, though.  Maybe you could talk me into playing it again, but maybe not.

This game is so good and so addictive. It can also be very hard too! I find that with two players you have to do at least one of the mentioned variants to even have a chance to win.

I'm a sucker for realtime games, so I bought this not expecting much. It turned out to be remarkably good! It was a kickstarted game with limited availability and the scenarios clearly don't scale well with player counts--fewer players just means fewer actions available with which to solve the scenario. Despite that, the game makes it easy to adjust the difficulty, difficult to solve by rote, and very approachable for new gamers to join in.

I like this game. I accidentally played this at Gen Con (I signed up for it thinking it was something else), but it turns out the frantic and sometimes hopeless feel of the game really appealed to me. I've been told that this concept has been done before, and done better - but this is the first game I've played of this type.

I've played it quite a few times now, including once at the pub for game night. It was pretty well received by all, although some folks seem to have trouble getting some of the mechanics down for some reason (dropping one item at a time to repair, how teleporting works, etc.) It's kind of hard to keep everyone on the rails if you are also trying to play the game. I might add that the rulebook seems a little disorganized also.

Anyway, it's a fun, frantic, cooperative game, and sometimes that's just what we need. I'd buy it again.

This is one of my favorite board games ever. In so many ways, it reminds me of the video game FTL. Both games are about modular space ships, where the crew must work together to keep the ship afloat. Both have some of the best game design available in their respective fields, and both suffer from lackluster art. 

Unfortunately, while FTL has managed to overcome its art and become a wildly popular success, this game seems to have been unfairly dragged down by it. Often, while trying to get people interested in playing this game, I hear the same argument: they're not interested in any game with such bad art. It's disappointing. Art is important, sure, but in the end it shouldn't be the deciding factor in whether you play a game or not. 

Despite many hours of playing, I don't think I've won this game very often. The difficulty level is pretty high. Part of that is the real-time turns, which makes it much more difficult for skilled players to quarterback. Everyone is trying to talk and move at the same time. Sometimes they'll look down to notice that they're timer is already out, and they've been wasting some unknown amount of time that they could have been acting. It gets pretty exciting. 

I won't claim Damage Report doesn't have any drawbacks or flaws. But if the concept of the game sounds interesting to you, buy it. You won't be disappointed.

"Real-time co-op where players are crew, repairing their spaceship. However, the real-time aspect actually SLOWS you down, where you have to wait X seconds between turns. Very clever twist. It seems that you need houserules to scale the game for the number of players."

What I like:
- Fun theme (although similar to 3 other games)
- Clever twist on real-time
- Character special abilities are well-done
- Modular board with multiple scenarios

What I don't like:
- Rules don't provide good scaling by player count
- Cards and tokens are a bit fiddly...can spill during the game
- Seems like it might get repetitive (move/grab/move/repair)
- Waiting 30 seconds to take a turn can be frustrating
- Limited number of tools seems very brutal

Damage Report was fun and challenging. To compare it to other real-time spaceship-repair co-ops: I didn't enjoy my one attempt at Space Alert, and haven't yet decided how I feel about USS Ocius. I haven't tried Space Cadets. 

I would put the weight around 2.4, although I haven't tried the advanced scenarios yet.

A frantic game, running about a modular spaceship board, acting at the same time as all of the other players to avoid an overbearing "leader" that I've experienced in Pandemic, Forgotten Island, and Elder Sign. 

Pros - The time mechanic is right on, keeping everyone busy and sometimes arguing with limited time before their next move. I also really like the different character abilities and play-styles that can accommodate new players and veterans alike.

Con - My copy came with a few light scratches on the board, and some chips out of the timer bases. I think this was due to the way it was packaged.

Since receiving it, I try to bring it to every game night I attend.

I've liked very few real time games with Galaxy Trucker being a huge exception, which I love!  I don't have a problem with the mechanic but I just think it is a hard mechanic to build around, especially for someone like me who prefers meatier, deeper games most of the time.  With depth comes thought and planning and those things don't mesh well with a ticking clock.

This one is good though.  It certainly doesn't have great depth but for a cooperative romp I enjoy it.  In the game we are all part of the crew of a space ship that is being attacked by aliens.  We are trying to either battle the aliens with weapons or spin up the warp drive to escape.  We do this by collecting resources around the ship and using them to operate stations on the ship.  This is where the real time mechanic comes in, each action can only be taken once every so many flips of the timer, this can be increased using one of the stations on the ship.

However, every 3 minutes (once every 6 30-second actions to start the game) the aliens shoot at us and damage parts of the ship that slow us down and give us more work to do to repair the ship.  It's a difficult game, at least in my experience, but the tension is at a right level and I found myself mentally occupied and interested despite the lightness of it which bleeds through even with the cartoony artwork.  Each player also has a special power which is standard for any coop.

Also, because it's light you can teach it to most people and the components are good quality with pieces that actually look like what they are (metal plates, purple crystals, microchips, etc.)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Real time co-op. OK, but it just doesn't stack up to Space Alert. Actions are mostly repetitive, components are fiddly. Really hard to play two player; there's no player scaling at all, so it just gets easier with more players, and with two you just don't have enough actions.

Gameplay itself was more fun that I expected, though has some flaws; the timer mechanic works decently but is very boring if you're trying to move across the ship.

Everything about it could be improved upon, but it was such a good foundation, real shame they never got to expand on it.  
I'm still giving it a 8.5 because its that much fun and the timing mechanism is something ive never seen before, it adds to the stress and frantic energy of the game, keeps things exciting even while youre waiting 30 seconds to make your next play.   A bit pricey at its normal cost, but if you see it on the clearance rack, grab it.

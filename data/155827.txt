This game is just bad. Boring, not compelling, and awful rules. Translation errors all over it, including a character who can't be played without finding translations [i]and then corrections to the translations[/i]. It takes the most boring part of an MMO and just has you do that over and over.

if you are a fan of KROSMASTER BACKGROUND, you will love it, it is easy to build new scenarios or add new rules while you are playing..
The rulebokk is NOT  well explain but to spread on the 30 pages.
the quality of the composants are average (the adventure trail for exemple)  but the miniatures are awesome !!!!

if you are a fan: buy it

if not : try it before buying

I have never played a 4x game, but I imagine it amplifies the amazing feeling I had playing this.  An epic game, hard to get to the table, but worth it.

Take Krosmaster game mechanics, through them in to a competetive-coop against a villain in a somewhat of an open setting & map and you Krosmaster:Quest. Ambitious. Full of potential, but low on direction early on.

Traded 10/16

This feels like it would need more streamlining/playtesting.

The map tiles (heavy card stock) warp a lot. I found a solution by using clear acrylic tiles over them to keep them flat.

But I didn't find a solution to the gameplay itself.

I really wanted to like this game, as I was already heavily invested in Krosmaster Arena. My whole Krosmaster stuff really takes some space and is worth a lot of money, that's why I traded everything. This was supposed to be the game that prevented me from selling everything; it failed.

I preordered this at GenCon as soon as it was announced because I loved the original game. After the long delay in finally getting it, it does nothing for me. I have too many dungeon crawlers and the system doesn't work as well as I wish it did.

Unlike the head-to-head battles of Krosmaster: Arena, Krosmaster: Quest can be played "cooperatively" (with one player as the "demon" and the rest of the players working together), or as a competition as players look for treasures on tiled boards. The box includes seven new Krosmaster figures with character cards (two exclusive), more than 600 pieces, 16 terrain parts (which can be used in Arena), more than 40 settings, and 6 special dice.

We were hoping that this would be an RPG in a box that used Krosmaster figures. Instead we just got a slightly different way to still play Krosmaster. Such a disappointment.

Got to play the final version at Gen Con and examine the scenario book with a Japanime games rep.

The game looks fun on its own and the potential for fan created scenarios is really interesting.

RATING: 8
Its the precise same feeling as playing a mmo using all your krosmaster figurines. the set of rules admit scenarios where you can go crazy about componentes, tweaks, using components of other krosmaster games or even writing a campaign.

RATING: 3
Too much fuss and ridiculous complexity for a game that should be fairly light.

RATING: 5.5
With 2 players there's no fun to be found. The components' quality is OK, but the rulebook is utterly useless.

played a protptype at Essen 2013. Note that I have not played Krosmaster before (or after) that:
well... cute figures, unique abilities; still a dungeon crawl

RATING: 8
This is a solid 1 vs many game, and I'm very happy to have more uses for my Krosmaster figures. The game plays all vs all, which I haven't tried, or 1 vs many. I somewhat wish it did fully co-op, but that's how it goes. I have only one concern, which is that the game timer relies on flip luck. The game ends when X events have come out, so an unlucky card run, and the game could be impossibly short I'd need to play more to see if this is really a problem, or maybe it's a problem that could be easily house ruled, or some such

:star: Art, Iconography and components functional
:star: Clever or interesting mechanisms
:star: Reasonably low downtime between turns with mildly AP players
:star: Multiple plays stay interesting
:star: Low or mitigatable luck elements
:star::star::star::nostar::nostar: Raw enjoyment

RATING: 5
Beautiful. Gameplay is complex, not focused. I think that Mice and Mystic type scenarios would be much more interesting. As it is you have to invest 5-10 hours to understand the rules and they are obviously not quite ready. (e.g. dungeon difficulty does not scale with number of players.)

Looks fabulously and mechanics are so delicious! Long but interesting all the tone play. A lot of scenarios so will stay for long with us. Colourful terrain and painted miniatures. Massive amount of components. The only downside are the map tiles - everything else is on cardboard but these are just thick paper.

Fun RPG-Style board game. Only missing a few tweaks from being good to being great. Uses the same character as Krosmaster Arena & Junior. Needs a few more plays to fully appreciate the game.

Juego divertido. Mazmorreo pero con muñecos cabezones. La estética te puede gustar.... o no. A mi si que me gusta. Pero como en todos los juegos en los que entre tu jugada y la siguiente tienen que jugar todos los demás y hay poca o ninguna interaccion requiere una cosa que en nuestro grupo de juego rara vez se consigue: fluidez y agilidad :)
Aun asi me gusta y es un juego a tener en cuenta para 5 0 6 jugadores.

Edito, el juego esta roto, o le jugamos mal, y al acabar la partida te quedas con la sensación de que no has podido hacer casi nada. le bajo un poco la nota

RATING: 5
Fun Game if you love "easy" Dungeon Crawl 
The game do have a good manual, not easy read.
Also can be improved the game-play (not good escalation), too many useless rules

ITA: il gioco è carino ma soffre di gravi difetti sul game play, non scala molto bene al crescere dei giocatori (più sono i giocatori più facilmente finisce il gioco a favore del GM/gioco). Il manuale è scritto decisamente male. Secondo me alcune regole/accessori sono superflui e creano solo confusione, vedi trade item. Ma possiede ampi margini di miglioramento se verrà aggiornato. I tile sono di pessima qualità (cartonino leggero e rimango piegati sul tavolo). Consigliato solo se i è appassionati di Krosmaster Arena.

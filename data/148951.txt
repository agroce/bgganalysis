A Huge disappointment. I really liked the initial concept of a fast playing area control that fits into your pocket and should have a good replay value. However, the game turned out to have three massive shortcomings.

1. The print on the sheets is just way too small for being read across the table. You will have very little idea what the special powers of the other players are. There are too many races, too, for you to pick up them all in a reasonable number of plays.

2. Fighting is unrewarding. It will just make you spend your resources (although you don't have to if you want to push your luck) while the peaceful players can use theirs to generate victory points. And even if you chose not to spend and you were lucky, the only gain was not losing the resources.

3. There is no hidden scoring mechanisms. All information is public. It is not fun if you do not have to agonize over the decision whether or not to end the game this turn or the next. This is especially problematic, since you are not playing a predetermined number of rounds. The game ends exactly when one of the players chooses to trigger the game end, provided that s/he has the resources. 

There are some great qualities to the game, however. I especially liked the fighting mechanic. It created a certain fog of war and lead to agonizing decisions while it still played quick.

Finally, I'd say that the concept was promising but the aforementioned issues make the game virtually unplayable from the viewpoint of having fun. The game also offered very few interesting decisions for being made.

Really good compact game about taking land and exploiting resources better than other competing races. Much less combat and conquest than you would think depending on the race you are playing. The game really gives you a LOT of different races to play so you can enjoy yourself quite a bit and have a different game experience every time. I think of it as a sort of micro small world.

My play group has broken this game and we can =not figure out a way to fix it.  Maybe by changing the cost and/or payout of the tower.  But basically as is, whoever can get the early jump on the Tower and just race it will win and cannot be stopped.

I am willing to try variants to fix this game, because I suspect it could be a really great game.  But this issue must be solved or the game just be first to level 6 tower wins.  EVERYTIME!

Disappointing. Another example of the pretty art and "cool" pieces over actual game play I seem to be getting in many of the Kickstarter games as of late. Just race your tower to the top first as it's by far the best return on your resources. Unfortunately, the powers are generally not worth the investment.

Review:
I REALLY enjoyed this game! It's just as good 2 player as it is 3 or 4. Have not played the solo version or 5 player yet.
The game design on this game is absolutely fantastic! Every inch of every card has a function. Kudos to the designer!
This game is very big for being so small. I felt like I had a big game experience while the game comes in a super small package. The game is really simple to learn, yet highly strategic. Easily could be used as a gaming 101 for the n00b, while being advanced enough to accommodate veteran players. To add to the strategy, I deal two race/kingdom cards to each player. The player must choose one to act as their race card and the other to act as their kingdom card. 
A $14 price point. For transparency's sake, I purchased my copy at Guardian Games in Portland, OR. 
This game has EASILY jumped into my top 5!

Harvest resources, move into new areas and harvest more resources.  Spend them on building a tower for vps and gaining magic abilities for fewer vps.  The concept of doing the same action as the active player or taking resources does keep the game ticking along at a good pace.  However, there wasn't anything particularly compelling going on.   

Production quality is decent, but the artwork is nondescript.

I don't think I fault the game so much as the fact that for what it is, players are required to be very mindful of everyone else at the table to stop someone from running away with the game.  Like, it depends too much on you making sure it plays right, and that's not exactly great if your group isn't into that.

Of course if they don't care about playing a close game and like to just throw some meeples at each other across a few kingdoms while unlocking nifty abilities and such, great, go to town. ;)

A super portable 4X points race game for up to one* to five players! What's not to love?

The solitaire version is a little wonky, but once you get used to the way the D12 and 'compass card' control the "A.I." player, it's pretty cool.

*I have "Ultra-Tiny Epic Kingdoms," which came with the 'compass card.' The base Tiny Epic Kingdoms does not include this card, and is consequently 2-5 players with no solo variant. The compass card comes in the Ultra-Tiny version and in the expansion. As far as I can tell, it's the only thing missing from the base version to make it a solo game.

This is one of those big games in a little box.  There is quite a bit to like about how this one plays out.  It's designed to be a quick game and it succeeds at that.  It's like, but still has some strategic elements.  The replay value is high - considering the variety of races.  But within that mix also lies the game's biggest weakness.  An individual game could end up swinging pretty harshly by the balance of the races in that session.  Not all of the races are well suited to working with the others.  Some are quite powerful and others pitifully weak.  The wrong mix means that the game experience could be quite poor.  the right mix and the game experience is quite good.  I think this game would benefit from a published list of setups that work well.  Especially for early plays.  Outside of this drawback, the game is pretty solid and nice addition to a game collection.

Really impressive what they can pack in the box here, 4x mechanics that are smooth and intuitive as you move tokens around tracks for magical research, resources and tower construction. The one bit that can feel a little tricky is the warring, not so much the fighting mechanic itself (a bid of resources on a 12-sided die), but the use of truces and then potentially breaking truces later that can really mess with the players' status out on the zones. Anyway, I would NEVER play this without the added Exploration element, it just makes the world feel richer and more fun. But this is a recommended game for breaking in newer players to the 4x genre without breaking their minds! Colorful and well-designed to boot, and I think the 2 player variant with the Neutral army works pretty well here.

Good game. It has hit the table quite a bit.
I'm sure the expansion will improve my rating.

Have lost twice to the dwarfs which seem can seem a bit overpowered if they get to build before you. And it can be hard to catch up to them once they start building (with tower building "exponentially" giving points per level build after the second level).

I would seem that the expansion can "fix" this by giving you the option to destroy towers. 
Looking forward to play this with Heroes' Call.

While this is a portable, quick, filler "4x" game... the game invites and almost requires a level of meta-gaming to work; Without the threat of conflict, the game lacks fluidity and the decisions seem shallow. Furthermore, the action-selection mechanic lacks tension or any interesting blocking... if a player doesn't want or can't complete an action, they simply gather resources, which often seem equally advantageous. The game's mechanical foundation (not factions) seem too well-balanced.

Despite that, the game didn't overstay its welcome. I'll play it again but suspect the game may become annoying with repeated plays.

This game isn't bad, but it's not amazing.  I'll definitely give the designer credit for doing a pretty good job of covering a wide design space in a small package.

For how much it seems like the game wants you to attack one another, it seems like all parties benefit more from alliances than attacking, though there does come a time when a good strike is beneficial.

I really didn't get the feeling like the races were balanced.

I did really like the action selection mechanism along with the decision of the other players to follow suit or collect resources.  That is the strongest part of the game in my opinion.

Dude, I love it.  It's exactly what it says on the tin -- a fantasy 4X that plays in thirty minutes.  If I wanted to introduce a newbie to the concept of a 4X, this is EXACTLY the game I'd break out.  The rules are simple enough to play really fast but still have enough depth to satisfy, with a multiple paths to victory and enough asymmetry to give each faction its own feel.  Oh, and it overfunded like crazy on Kickstarter, so you get some lovely production values to boot.

I can't imagine this will cost more than $30 when it goes on sale, and it has a tiny footprint on your shelf.  It will more than carry its weight.  This is a light, delicious 4X snack and is highly recommended.

Tiny Epic Kingdoms is a super light civilization game with an oversimplified resource management: tiny it is but you don’t feel anything epic about the way it plays.

Simply put, it’s just a slightly more demanding filler than usual that also happens to have a hint of a pasted-on fantasy theme.

Initial Impressions:
----------------------
I was actually pretty excited to give this one a shot, but it fell kind of flat (Tiny Epic Blah?).  While there were some interesting aspects of it, the attacking felt like it would weaken you WAY too much too attempt it.  It also felt like it ended way too fast.  By the time you get any of your cool faction abilities, the game is about to end.  The main action selection aspect of the game was interesting, but the game felt like it was under developed.

My whole family enjoys playing this one (probably slightly more than I do). It's a mini 4X game that isn't hard to learn and doesn't take too long to play. There are several paths to victory, none of which I can seem to figure out. Each round, every player gets to pick which action will be taken on their turn. Other players can either take the same action or collect resources. Timing is everything. If you need one more food before you expand, and another player picks the expand option, you'll be stuck waiting until the next round, so you may have to adjust your strategy. 

Overall, this game is pretty engaging and packs a lot of fun into a small box. It has more components in that tiny box than a lot of full-size games, so you don't feel like you are missing out on anything due to the size.

There are a few races that are good to be played by beginner players as they have less subtlety and complex rules.

Some races leverage on the
(1) positioning of their units on specific terrain to gain bonus points
(2) receive additional bonus when attacking units of another race
(3) ability gain more resource or exchanging them with different resource (like Elves)
(4) control another player's actions (e.g. Halfling which can be very annoying)

There are races that require a few game plays for players to have some ideas on how to use them competently like Mimic so these races should only be introduced to the intermediate player.

Halfling
Seemingly innocuous race but are shrewd and opportunistic.
Willing to back stab other races.
Some races will enter into an alliance to gain peace as they find the presence of the society of these small size humanoid as less threatening and not worth spending resources to deal with them.

Raise Dead
Call upon the bone of the fallen
Remnants of the dead
Join the rank
Scavenge the deceased soldiers

The game can move fast as whenever the active player call for an action, each other player in clockwise player can choose to follow so there can be little downtime.

Fun, quick game. I love it because everyone does something on each turn. I have only played against real people one time, and war was even harder because it's like bidding and I'm horrible at bidding. Vinny didn't bother to fight back ever, so he kept losing, and I declared peace trying to talk Chris into an alliance. He went full 11 instead!

Update: with TEK: Hero's Call they have some rules updates. I would be interested in retrying the game with the updated rules, since I believe 1 rule is that you can "retreat" when you lose a war, if there is a connecting open space.

I love area majority games and I liked the fresh take on this genre.

There were two major issues with the game in my opinion:

Firstly spending resources in fighting doesn't give big enough rewards so that it would compensate the weakened position of both players involved in the battle. It's too easy for the other players to take advantage in the situation and preferably not fight at all.

Secondly I generally don't like area majority games where there's not a single hidden score element. It's not fun to spend time counting points in the end to figure out whether or not end the game. Alien Frontiers had similar issues and El Grande is a good example of a game where this problem has been solved elegantly (cubes in the tower which come to the board secretly).

I had played this as a print and play during the kickstarter and the game has changed considerably for the better since then. It's more streamlined and it's harder to force someone completly out of the game.

For such a tiny game there is alot of strategy to it more then you can really grasp in one play through... Unfortunatly I was only able to get this played once, although it will definatly be hitting the table again soon.

Interesting mix of Euro + theme with assymetric factions. The game is very short and the actions selection system tends to make every player do the same thing each turn.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
TEK, at it's heart, seems to be a game of positioning and timing.  Each turn, someone selects an action, and everyone else follows suit, so you want to make sure you're in the right position to capitalize on other player's choices.  You want to ensure that no matter what someone chooses, you can do something decent with it.

While, everyone is essentially playing the same game and working toward the same goals, the neat twist is that everyone is playing a different race that gives them slightly different abilities to shake things up.  I thought this was a really neat touch, at it was neat to see how the races differed.

However, in the end, while TEK is a well designed game that works, I just didn't find it to be that exciting in the end.  The goals players are working toward just felt kind of dull (advancing up some tracks and populating the board).  I can see how others might like it a lot more than I did though.

RATING: 5
Perfectly fine design with a couple of clever mechanisms.  I dig the variety of races and the game hangs together pretty well for being a microgame.

However, the game does squeeze out many of the qualities which make 4X games satisfying to achieve that stripped down playtime.  Fighting is not incentivized and you can largely play a solitary Euro-style strategy that makes for a bland and uninspired experience.  Because of this it's just an ok filler with just enough strategy but it's not a game with anything really to get excited about.

I am a deluxe edition backer. Printed out the free basic print and play version and have played. The game is easy to learn, intuitive to play, and has a surprising amount of strategic depth, much of which comes from the faction tech tree. With the basic version this could get a bit "samey" after many plays but the KS version has many more factions. If these are well done I may raise my rating even further.

Backed the original deluxe edition. was hyped. However it totally fell flat for me. I played with 3 groups and it failed to resonate with any. Not to say the game is bad, it just does not fit me. 

first group: non gaming colleagues. way too difficult for them. i will stick to ticket to ride and the likes for future.

2nd group, my regular gaming group. way too simple and deterministic. not much strategy to talk about in this game. you have choices, yes, but they dont really matter. diplomacy is the order of the day.

3rd group: casual gamer. just doesnt work. they dont like conflict, play peacefully and the game become a boring as hell.

It is impressive how much strategy and variance they pack into the little box.  TONS of replayability thanks to the huge amount of combinations with maps and kingdom types.  Very very in depth, but some random map draws can make some very lucky combinations feel severely overpowered and the land masses don't always seem to mesh together well.  There's a lot of "house rule voting" on specifics like what constitutes a body of water or what land area borders which on another board.  A good time though, and since the players choose when to end the game through their actions, everyone has to be very aware of a lot of factors with every player in the game.

I'm not entirely sure what to think on this one.

On the one hand, it's really neat. Wonderfully stripped-down Civ. Racial techs feel very different. Spatial layout seems to matter. It does look like the game will often come down to efficiency of action use - do you have enough magic at the moment someone else takes Research? - but I'm OK with that, particularly in a short game.

On the other hand, there are some areas of the game that make me wary. It has the "attacking probably just helps everyone who isn't involved" problem that many civ/multi-player combat games succumb to, exacerbated by the blind-bid nature of combat. The resource-gathering upon not taking an action felt too good - when I took an action my opponents couldn't make good use of, I didn't feel like I'd gained any sort of advantage - which scales back the stakes of one of the game's primary points of interactivity.

I don't know what to make of this. Well, actually- one valuable discovery about games for me that came through this game was this: the physical presentation of a game matters to me. A bigger presentation with more weight adds to the fun factor for me- when it is so lightly presented as this, even though it is a good game mechanically, I just don't have as much interest.

I am prejudiced and elitist. I know.

Nice art. Great mechanics. Tight/cutthroat play without being too personally vicious.

If you aren't prejudiced like me, you likely will love this.

Each player starts with a country consisting of 5 regions (plains producing food, forests producing magical manna, hills producing ore, castle areas worth 2 points, swamps producing a resource of your choice). Water and mountains on the maps are impassable. In one of the regions the player can place 2 armies. Each player also plays with a specific race, each with their own tech abilities. During his turn the player can choose 1 out of 6 actions (move an army within a country, move an army to another country, pay food (as many as you have armies) to create a new army in a region where you have 1 army, pay manna to increase your tech level (max 5), pay ore to build your tower (max 6), trade 1 type of resources for 1 other type). The other players may produce in the regions where they have at least 1 army. When 2 players meet in a region, each with 1 army (each region can only hold two armies), then they have to choose a value on their identical battle dice (1 to 11 or a flag implying to want peace). Both have to pay the cost of the war by spending manna (2 war points) and/or ore (1 war point). Some face down chits spread out across the regions add an element of surprise (good or bad things can happen).

After spending about 1.5 hours on a 5 player game, it turns out this is not anything near the 30 minutes. Also, I found the game to be a bit repetitive, especially so since the decisions seemed rather obvious (and technology doesn't branch or anything). I'd much rather play a more complex game in that amount of time.

Also, as someone else has remarked, the tower seems a bit overpowered, being the only nonlinear path to victory.

A much hyped game that fails to deliver.
The decision to print each race on one small card was done for profit only and makes the game fiddly and hard to read. 
The races seem somewhat unbalanced and the game is over before any "theme" sets in.
Going to war is usually not worth the trouble. 
I prefer Eight Minute Legends in almost every way.

I respect what this game is trying to do: distill a complex game genre down to its essence. What it ends up doing, however, is making a bland and generic game in a bland and generic world. The mechanics technically function, but the game is boring and the characters are very unbalanced. Kingmaking is a problem. While we always play it out, everyone I have tried this with wants to stop halfway through.

I swear I played this one before, and to this end, I'm annoyed at myself for forgetting to review it at the time. To this end, I must not thought much of the game the first time.

It is a micro game in the purest sense. It works, is non-threatening, and in the end doesn't do much. The decisions are fairly bland and in a vacuum, player actions and scoring is in almost parity. If someone is foolish enough to fight another player, those not involved are the winners. The real kick in the nuts is how the alternate resource collecting action is almost always better than the chosen action, and since the active player can't perform this side action, it leaves a backwards feeling of not wanting to be the leader.

More gimmick than game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
The components are all very nice. The maps and wood bits are great. It's just a shame they aren't used in a game that's anywhere near good or fun. 

It is kind of a multiplayer war game. But the combat system is very poor. The race powers are all different, but some seem useless. In fact I didn't use mine at all because it didn't seem worth wasting the effort to level up, and I won easily. Some of the race powers are actually useful, so lots of balance issues, given that the powers are the only things that differentiate the players.

I appreciate the quick play and the relatively simple rules (with only the breaking of alliances being a bit unwieldy), but TEK is too light for my tastes. I went in expecting an amazing Civ-in-30 minutes experience, but the game is closer to a Settlers of Catan derivative in both feel and scope. This could be a nice gateway game for those who are interested in the theme.

I particularly liked the Puerto Rico style action selection, though warfare seemed only to benefit the players not involved.

Settlers' & Smallwords' pint-sized love child. Resource-gathering, levelling up, fighting, negotiation...it's all here in mini form. Some races seem to be more powerful than others with certain tiles (Order of Gamelyn on a "wild" resource tile: I'm looking at you). But overall, it's pretty balanced & it's interesting to see how different strategies work against others. Quick to learn, easy to play. Lots of strategy. Even better when played with MeepleSource's TEK meeples.

1x 3-player game at the Essen Spiel Game fair.

The game looks extremely promising, all the rules seem to fit nicely together and the micro-components are quite nice. We strated the game with some expectations... To say that I was disapointed is quite an understatement. The game simply does not work at least with 3-players. It is a 4x simplified to the bone, and that's where the issues comes from imho : there is no space and no time for the metagame to develop. The the players cannot even out the balance issues. Hence, it is quite possible to know who the winner will be as soon as the 3rd or 4th round... without being able to do anything against it. Indeed an insightfull leader cannot be catched up because in case of ties the attacking player loses... you have to gang up to deplete his ressources. To issues here : the first to attack gets no spoils, since the only pave the way for the others and their is no way to allow a compensation by the others (i.e. giving ressources to another player).

Played as a Euro it is boring, and its been to streamlined to be played as an ameritrash. Great ideas, nice mechanics, nice components, boring to play

I love this game for what it is: a light 4x game game with barely more complexity than Carcassonne. [b]I own it.[/b]

Rating history: 10|8...|6|4

Me currently: :star::star::star::nostar::nostar: (2p game)
Kevin rates: :star::star::star::star::nostar:

Plays:
2p x 7 (good, but lacks a bit of sprarkle)

1st play: :star::star::star::star::star:. NOV14. I had been on the fence about buying this, finally taking it out of my cart last week. Then I popped over to Dewald's, saw it on his shelf and asked to play. WOW! Think 4x game with Carcassonne complexity. It didn't blow me away, but it found an important niche in my play-rotation. Fantastic for what it is, greatly aided by the different race cards (and it would be easy to player-make new races!) Bought it after my first play.

2nd play: :star::star::star::star::nostar:. NOV14. 
3rd play: :star::star::star::star::nostar:. NOV14. It's not that the game is bad with two - it's an interesting game of well-chosen battles and tactical resource denial. I do think though that the alliance rules etc. will make the 3+ player playings of this a 5-star game in my book. Or maybe I'll even grow to appreciate the 2p game more. =)
4th play: :star::star::nostar::nostar::nostar: I want to like this game, but the battle/acquisition is just too simplistic, and this game doesn't work as a 2p or 3p game, in my opinion. Traded.

Backed the Kickstarter since the game sounded awesome. Unfortunately it turned out to me a game for someone else.

I'm not saying that the game is bad, but it is bad for me and my gaming group. I didn't find anything that was broken, but I didn't find anything that made it worth playing either.

Essentially TEK is a worker placement game with a twist (you share workers, i.e. actions/shileds, with everyone). This is where it breaks down for me - the theme is one of kingdom building and the races are supposed to support that, as is the war mechanism etc. Problem is that there's a giant clash between theme and mechanics.

On their own the mechanics don't hold up our interest. We've played a couple of times and play became quite tedious. Even the winner simply shrugged and said "good that the game's over".

So from our game group - zero engagement, no fun. You might have a different result.

Valahogy mostanában a rosszul játszott játékok korát éljük. Ezt se sikerült első kettőre jól játszani, ráadásul elég alap dolgot rontottunk el. Mindenesetre azért így is kialakultak érzések vele kapcsolatban:

+ jópofa grafikák
+ jó a rengeteg faj, mind-mind más képességekkel
+ jó oldották meg az interakciót is. Egyrészt akkora galibát nem okoz ha "megtámadsz" valakit. Viszont valamennyire ki is van kényszerítve, hogy megtedd.
- extrém nagy különbség van a fajok ereje között

RATING: 3
The action following is unique because each player can select to collect resources instead--meaning that players want to select actions that players want to take rather than the ones they do not.

There is a huge level of complexity added to the game by a blind-bid combat mechanism that offers practically no incentive to engage in it between the plentiful resource availability and the massive drain on vital resources. The tension of combat is absolutely necessary to the game, but it acts solely as a gating mechanism to slow the game down rather than something with which players want to engage.

One 4-player game in, and all four of us enjoyed it.  Clearly, some of the factions are more powerful, but I'm not sure that matters.  It can definitely be a very confrontational game, and a few early loses in wars really hurt.  I have no idea yet about strategy, but it's got quite a lot of game in such a small box.

My students love it, but I'm growing weary of it already - not a good sign.  It's simple and good enough, but there's just not quite enough player interaction for me to enjoy this type of game.

Kickstarted this. Didn't like the component quality. The wood, while it looks nice in images on the geek, is very low grade and so light it feels like paper. The paint is very matte as though they skimped on varnish. Definitely does not have the quality feel of German-made games.

The "boards" are cardstock and not boards, the edges of which were whitened out of the box. Replacements were posted by Gamelyn but they have the same problem.

This was my first kickstarter and the price and KS imagery looked good. Live and learn.

In short, I just didn't have fun playing this.  

I really wanted to like it (I spent enough on it + expansion + meeples), but after 3-4 plays, I am just not feeling the love.  I thought it was the direct confrontation, war & broken alliances, but the last time I played, it was a pretty peaceful game, so that wasn't it.  I even won, and didn't get any thrill out of it.  There's a lot here that I should like, but it just didn't do it for me.  I wasn't bored, and I don't hate it, but I just didn't have fun.

This may be the first game I've ever bought for myself that I'm deciding to purge (though there's another Kickstarter game that probably should go first).  So sad.  Who wants to trade?

I was impressed by this game. It's very ambitious and very portable, with lots of varied components and races to choose from. It wouldn't be my choice for a 4X game, but I find it admirable that it fits inside such a small box.

Unfortunately I have to mention the art, because it was a turn-off. Standard fantasy is boring for me, and there's so many other games who represent that in a more appealing way.

'Tis OK, but a bit flat with two players. I wonder if it will be better with more... It might also be a bit aggressive for my (and my partner's) tastes (except in wargames); many of the nations favour aggressive tactics, so you'd be at a disadvantage not to use this when you can. However, our groups rarely go in for PvP antics.

As a solo player I can't really complain about it - it's 2+ players on the box. I just find it a bit clunky and drawn out, and the couple of times I've got the kids to play it, it hasn't gone down too well. Bit of a miss for me, unfortunately.

First off, I own the Ultra-tiny version, and have never played the original. With that said, this game is not a better game than say Eldritch horror, which I rated as a seven, but it is extremely accessible. I once played a game of this in-between classes at college (about 30 min) with a classmate who isn't even into the hobby. It is exactly what it purports to be. A condensed 4x asymmetric fantasy game. There is a lot of replay ability to be had in the different races, and the mechanics will be familiar to any 4x fan. The most interesting feature though is the way in which players take actions, and choose to follow the leader or gather resources. Experienced players can deny their opponents the opportunity to take the most advantageous actions through smart decision making which is an excellent layer to an otherwise serviceable filler game. Our play group does agree however that the tech tree is over powered, and that the game feels as though it is missing something. I've heard that Heroes call does a lot to remedy that with the addition of exploration tokens, hero "trees" and functional war towers. I never leave home without this little game.

The action selection and multiple end game triggers are pretty well done but the gameplay comes off as a bit hollow for me.  The decisions aren't meaningless but the game is so quick that nothing feels very satisfying to do.  If there were chances for bigger moves or some kind of climax it would be a great game.  Instead it trails off at the end.

Has an action selection mechanism like Puerto Rico, where picking an action lets your opponents do the same. If they don't follow along, they gather precious resources, making the choice tougher.

I would have rated the game higher if i thought the races were balanced.
But even if not completely balanced this game offers a full game experience with very few components in a very short ammount of time. Bravo i say!
Artwork is good & game play pretty tight.. always make sure you have enough magic to defend yourself to some degree, otherwise a player might try you, weaken you & then others will just steamroll over you..

Different winning paths seem balanced too. Pretty good for what it's supposed to be..

RATING: 6
Intriguing due to the tiny footprint, this one is best met with expectations likewise constrained.  It isn't a "big game in a small package", it's just small all around; an ambitious filler, really.  A certain level of whimsy and suspension of gamer-disbelief is required to enjoy it.  Trying to make a meal out of this [i]amuse-bouche[/i] will leave you hungry and disappointed.

As is usual for Kickstarter games this one looks great but feels vaguely brain damaged—I'm sure there are degenerate strategies and "broken" powers lurking beneath the surface, to be found, mercilessly exploited and then dishearteningly house-ruled until we can't stand to touch it anymore.  How many plays in the box, then?  Who can say—but more than would be expected when engaged with a light touch and lowered expectations, certainly.  Besides, it's short enough that even a thorough hosing is bearable.

[b]After 3 plays:[/b]  [COLOR=#979797](2p)[/COLOR]  I'm not sure it works with two—whoever gets the upper hand in resources and attacks on the first turn essentially wins the game, making it enormously uninteresting.  I suppose we could be Fonzies and ignore each other for a while... but that just feels weird when the win is dangling right there for the taking.

A 'tiny' game and tiny differences can make the difference between winning and losing, e.g. which terrain types border your opponents' kingdoms, how much you're picked on, being one resource short for that important build.

This game is so ridiculously fun. Like completely stupid wicked fun. Honestly, when I kickstarted it, I thought it would be kind of gimmicky. But since it was cheap, I went for it anyway. So totally worth it.

I haven't played another 30-45 minute game that feels so satisfying. You get an entire story arc in that short time frame, and the gameplay itself is jam packed in. The game feels at least twice as long as it is, but that isn't because it drags. It's because it is so filled with stuff that by the end, I feel as though there's no possibly way I did all of that in fewer than 45 minutes.

I enjoyed my first play, but that was only because I managed to avoid getting involved in any of the PvP stuff.  We played fairly peacefully and then I maneuvered so that I was immune to attack.

Use selected actions to explore areas with your meeples, gain resources from their locations, and use the resources to move closer to winning conditions. Some of the winning conditions become really easy to get to -- which explains why the game plays so quickly. Some decent strategy involved, but it's not a game that really leads to a sense of major challenge.

PLUS: easy to learn, quick play

Quick 4x kind of game. Ends very quickly so getting attacked early and not being able to win doesn't matter so much. Since it is quick though there isn't much time to use your races special powers more than twice.

RATING: 7
I have played this now several times with 2, 3, 4, and 5 players. While I think it is best with 4, it plays well with 3 and 5 (not so much with 2). Each of the factions feel different and the game gives you all kinds of choices that are extremely fun. 

The "choosing actions" mechanic is great and makes you think long and hard about how to arrange your resources.

The one thing that I have noticed in every game is that the tower is a fairly invalid strategy to win the game. Even the Dwarves, who are geared toward it, struggle to win. Besides, the magic research, exploring, and warring are so much more fun.

All in all I think this is a great, portable, strategic game. It is well worth the $25.

I was on the fence about buying this one. I wish I'd gotten off the fence a long time ago. It's a great game. With the Heros Call expansion it's outstanding. The number of factions and lands are outstanding. It's really neat how the factions all have different feel to playing them. 

The solo play is fun as well and flows fast. I'd love to see race/land expansions even in PDF/pnp form. 

Some races are not suited to solo play and it would be fun to be able to at least tweak them ourselves with the template. Having a hard time tracking it down though.

RATING: 6
Hm. Tiny Epic Kingdoms. I kickstarted this game a few years ago and really enjoyed the idea of a short, portable 4X game. What I got, though, was interesting. The game has action-selection that can be used to block off opponents at the right time and the tower is good for sneaking in a couple of extra points. The rest of the game feels almost there. War with other players almost seems beneficial and race powers almost seem balanced. The original two-player variant was very strange, but the updated, official variant (can be found on the game's BGG page) is significantly better and makes players actually want to go into the Lost Kingdom.

RATING: 6
10-24-2014 - I was hoping for more out of this one, though it really does do what it claims which is to fit a 4X game into a small box game that plays in 30 minutes.  I should bump the rating by one just for that!  But the game play just isn't that exciting and it can get confusing as to who's turn it is.  At least it was for us as we took our time with most of our plays.  War is pretty interesting as you decide if you want to White Flag it or commit resources, but if someone spends star points on a magic level they're pretty much inviting disaster and it's hard to catch up.  I'm sure it all balances out and that frustration is part of the fun, but at times it was just frustration.  We still had fun though.  Anyway, I guess I'm glad to have it and who knows, once we learn it better and play more races maybe I'll bump it up.  6 for now.

n Tiny Epic Kingdoms, a 4x fantasy game in a pocket-size package, each player starts with a unique faction (which has a unique technology tree) and a small territory. Throughout the game, players collect resources, explore other territories, battle each other, research magic, and work to build a great tower to protect their realm.

I finally had a chance to play with heroes call's expansion that seemed to have fixed a few things. The game I played took anormally too long (2h15) but I think it was our group that was too slow.

There are a few interesting idea, but in overall, it's not very elegant, and it can get confusing when half your meeples are spread out on other player's cards. It's the kind of game that could have worked well as a solitaire game a bit like it's the case for Pocket Civilization.

I don't remember the huge criticism I made before it got released, bu one thing I remember and that remains is that I hate the combat system. Adding a single die roll would have made wonders. Considering the game comes with D12 for battles, there is probably some variants out there that does so.

Amazing how much game is in this little box.  Disappointing that it feels pretty repetitive after a while.  But it's not ruined.  There is some replayability in the different races; good thing that are so many because that's all that really changes.  I like that there are different lands too, but that doesn't substantively change the game.

Still need to play the alternate play modes that came with this.

I'm not sure what to make of this game. Just as everything gets going, and competitive, the game is over. I have a strange feeling there will be later variations on this design that vastly improve upon the concept.

- When you finally unlock certain racial abilities they feel like too little too late

- Some of the races aren't very good

- This game feels like more of a race than 4x. 

I do like it, and will play it at least a few more times, but I'm losing interest rapidly.

I kickstarted the deluxe edition and have played the print and play edition. If you are considering purchasing TEK consider this: Fantasy theme, 4x, 15+ factions, meeples, custom dice, fantastic "Disneyesque" artwork, variable player powers, player interaction, easy set up and tear down, a low price point, a highly portable box, and a rule set easy enough for my 9 year old to understand, but a depth of play that my gaming group can appreciate. And all this from a game that can play in under an hour (lunch break anyone!!!).  Simply put, this game is one of the best micro games I have ever played!  It is an instant classic! Get it - you won't regret it!

I only played this 2-player for a while, and found it extremely lackluster. Then I played a 5 player game, and understood why everyone was giving it so much praise. Honestly, you really just need 3 players to get the actual game experience, which by the way, really is fantastic. IMO it's so bad with 2 players, I would have preferred if they would have just said 3-5 players, and focused the game more. Then maybe add in a (competent) 2 player game in the expansion, because 2 players is horrid.

Surprisingly good! Much content in tiny space.

Very strategic game, with no luck involved. Some factions seems to be much better than others, but you have to just master them if you want to play well with them. Maybe there could have been some more different maps in the box.

Solitaire Game workshop surprisingly well too. 

Hero's Call expansion adds the possibility to destroy enemy towers and that is a very good add to the game.

Preliminary rating. I definitely need more plays to form a solid opinion. After 1 play, it's fun, albeit a little odd. I didn't feel like I knew exactly what I was doing. Either it's not the most intuitive game, or I just didn't get it. Still, with how small and cute this package is, it certainly warrants more plays, especially considering the fact that I kickstarted it's 2 siblings.

First impression : Great value, the components are amazing. You can tell everything was designed with a lot of passion. Especially the artwork, although it's not the best technically, every character design is charming and it adds a lot of personality to the game. There's lots of depth behind every single decision, which is how every game should be.

(I'll have to try it more to give a more accurate score. The shortest of the game might be it's greatest selling point but also it's biggest flaw, because one mistake and you're out)

No luck. Lots of variation. Strategic game. The weaknesses include the fact that kingmaking is possible if multiple players play aggressively, and slow players like to play this game slowly (probably related to the fact that there is no randomness).

Eso sí, ni rastro de la cuarta x, la exterminación, puesto que el último mepple de un jugador siempre es inmortal. Aún, así, entretenido y bastante rejugable.

I backed the Ultra-Tiny edition of the game on Kickstarter. The production quality is excellent and it fits a lot into 1 card box.

The action system is a mechanic I like however the first few turns in a game are always the same (patrol, expand, build tower or research). On your turn if you cant do the action you want to do then you basically forfeit your turn. Preventing yourself from forfeiting is, for me, the most interesting part of the game.

Sadly I feel a bit let down by the actual game balance. Rushing to build your tower ends the game quickly in about 7 turns and will usually give you enough points to claim the victory. After a couple of games this ultimately discouraged people from exploring the other 'game ending' paths, including making use of your unique fraction powers (although there are some exceptions to this) which I feel was the main selling point of the game.

Just like in real life, the war mechanic forces both sides to pay for war and both the player's economies are crippled. In a 3+ player game it is difficult for either player to catch up. After a couple of games it just led to defensive play from everyone at the start.

Overall I am not that impressed, I think the game would greatly benefit from the tower changes made in the 'Heroes Call' expansion (sadly not included in the Ultra-Tiny version).

After all the hype (and the expert KS campaign), I ended up not liking this one at all. I found it clunky, the rules unclear in many places, and I genuinely disliked the "premium" shaped pieces as they were more confusing than anything else. Real shame, too, as it has a lot of potential.

Very interesting and challenging 4X game.

Better to play the game with some new player, for not always doing the same moves through all games. That's his weakness i guess : if all of the player uses some similar strategies, it's very straightforward. Best move is to choose a faction whose need a very different gameplay than the one we're the most used to after some dozen games. More replayability that way.

The game was fun at first, but after more plays it is hard for me to see what strategy really works best in this game.  Sure it only lasts 30 minutes, but it just feels a little too light for gamers and a little too heavy for others. 

Plus it always appears that anyone who participates in combat is the most likely to lose the game, except in two player games.  

Honeymoon phase for the game is over, so the score is getting dropped a bit.

It's not often that I hate a game this much.  In one turn I had two people attack me for almost no reason, nearly wiping me from the map, just because I happened to spend my resources the previous turn, so they could easily defeat me.  I was crippled for the entire game so that I didn't really have a chance to do anything.  Not fun.  It's easy to be killed and then it's very slow and expensive to rebuild, spread out and build up resources again.  Besides that, if you go late in the turn order you have to take a crappy action that doesn't help you at all, only to give everyone else a pile of resources, by which they can then pile-drive you in the next turn.  I wanted to like it, but it is too open to outright meanness.  I have no desire to play this again.

I was part of a ten-pack Kickstarter pledge through the ACT forums. This game looked like a pretty attractive option for my lunchtime gaming group in that it looked to have enough depth and replayability to make it worthwhile, but would be short enough to play over a lunchbreak.

Well, ours was one of the pledges where the ten-pack became a one-pack with the other nine on their way at some stage, maybe before the Xmas break, maybe not.

As fate would have it, the organiser of the pledge happens to be a regular attendee at our lunchtime gaming so we got to try out a three player game last week and I must say I was pretty impressed.

The game was very easy to learn but seems at this early stage to offer a whole heap of playing options, especially as there are a heap of different races to play each of which has their own distinctive characteristics.

So, thumbs up to this one and I look forward to receiving and playing a copy of my own soon-ish.

I purchased the Ultra Tiny version of this game, and they weren't kidding!  The whole thing fits into a standard-sized box for a deck of playing cards.  According to the person I played with, it plays similarly to Tiny Epic Kingdoms.  The differences I've noted are that you can play 2p head-to-head, or you can also add a neutral kingdom which you fight to control; there's a solo mode, and they include a special compass to help resolve solo play.  I thought there was a lot more strategy than I expected, and it was very chess-like, so a bit too forward-thinking for my tastes.  I'm hoping to like solo play better.

Finally a 4x-style game I like! Granted you need all the expansion content to make it feel like a proper 4x, but even the base game is pretty fun. A lot of the replay value comes through the different races you can try, but I find that this game has a lot of different avenues to pursue. I'm not a big fan of combat costing players resources, but it does deter those who like to stockpile them. Just a really awesome game in a tiny package.

UPDATE: The shine is starting to come off this one for me. I enjoy playing it, but too much of the game feels scripted and railroaded down certain paths. Considering all but one action will be taken every round, which usually ends up being the usually-trivial trading action, it's more about positioning yourself for resources than anything else. This is probably still my favorite game from Scott Almes, but I do wish that there was a little more freedom given to the players.

I should have guessed that a title selling itself as a 30 minutes 4X game - but streamlining the genre to the point one of the Xs (explore) would entirely disappear - was probably glossing over its other characteristics. Tiny Epic Kingdoms is perhaps not a terrible game and I could see my enjoyment of it improve by learning more of its intricacies during subsequent plays, but it piles up a number of issues that are each big enough to annoy me; most of them being related to poor map design.

Since each resource is balanced to have about equal usefulness, there is no incentive to wage war for the control of any of them long as there are free spots on the map; unfortunately that one, regardless of the combinations you might try, is really open and mostly uninteresting, resulting in a carebear early game. Now supposing we get two factions caring a lot about a single resource, it wouldn't change much since if they're going to war, the winner is likely the factions that don't take part in the conflict. In short, losing a war is too expensive (less resource production + an expensive meeple), but spending enough not to lose it is an equally unappealing proposition; being short on resources at any point to spend the next tower/magic/meeple building phase harvesting instead is not good, because the amount of those phases per game is limited and directly tied to victory. On the other hand invasions resulting in an alliance don't really work between rational players because they require two movements to be equitable, triggering two separate instances of game theory each having another player with the defender's advantage. Therefore aside from grabbing capital cities in an endgame situation, there is little incentive to be the one to break the status quo.

Though I'm usually a gameplay-centric person, I have to mention the components. Everything (including the bad map system) has been made within the limits of the Tiny Epic franchise marketing, which is basically "30 minutes playtime and small box so we can call it a microgame". Faction boards are small and thin (read "unstable") and the resource markers can fall off really easily. Plus since you can't move them around it's really hard to read the opponents'; so you can easily spend the whole game ignoring whatever is happening at the other side of the table. Except you can't, because supposing the game gets interesting and someone finally decides to wage war, you have to understand everyone's unlocked faction powers and the amount of each resources they currently have, those numbers often changing twice per minute for every player. Which is annoying to read and replan around, to say the least.

Really wanted to like this game but, the winning strategy is to go for the towers.  Combat is a giant kingmaker option as you will be taking out not only the victim but yourself as well as you have to waste resources on it.  So, the end result is that you eliminate yourself and another player which will allow the non-combatants to win as they will presumably be focusing on tower building.  In my youth I would have worked on some house rules to fix the game but I honestly just don't have the time anymore.  My first recommendation though would be to make level on the green track (I forget what that is at the moment) to be the first tie breaker.  Just to re-iterate, I really think the game is worth saving as there is some pretty cool stuff here and I hope someone does take the effort to do so as I would really like to play it.

It was really a fine game. Having it taught took about 10 minutes since we had to separate the pieces and double check some rules here and there. The gameplay took about 40 approximately, and scoring/cleanup took around 10 ish.

The game is fine for an almost filler game. I do like that there are no random elements other than the occasional ability (like the shapeshifters' drawing from the deck). The three resources, their balance, and the things they built/lead made sense and seemed relatively balanced.

There were some issues about balance that were raised. The person who taught it said every game he'd played, the dwarves always won. I was the dwarves this time, and I won this time too. I looked this up in a thread though, and it seems like the dwarves are only "good" while 4 races seem to be "better" in general? I certainly did think the dwarves I used had a nice advantage. I was targeted in the only two battles and lost two of my three dwarves, the other experienced person was always trying to build ahead of me on the tower, and yet, I still won. So I do think there may be some rebalancings that could be useful here.

I think the gameplay sometimes left a bit to be desired, especially on some turns when everyone was low on resources so everyone used the resource gathering action instead of the main action available. But its a filler, so I think that's okay. The boards were relatively plain too, but again, its a filler...Even so though, I thought it felt a little unimaginative after a while given everyone's board has a lot of similar combinations of fields and the orientation didn't matter too much.

The non-desire to fight is good from a non-kingmaking perspective, but I wonder if it goes against the spirit of the game? For a supposed 4x, fighting is fairly discouraged from my first (and obviously skewed glance).

Anyway, my favorite points were the 3 resources, the different actions/roles usually, and the combat mechanism. My greatest issues were race balances and the somewhat repetitive gameplay at times I think. The artwork is good but I wish there were more actions/ways to get VPs, and I think more balance on the races would be good.

Still, didn't blow me away or anything. But it was solid and a pretty good role selection. If they came out more balanced or as a better overall game, I think Id be very down for this.

Plays: 1

Played again at 2p as the human faction, and I think it worked well mechanically for 2p. I was surprised at how enjoyable it was though there were some dead ish turns without much happening. I think there may be a bit more of a noticeable imbalance but my loss to valkyries was my own. Want to play more to get more a feel but possible issues:
- 30m for a 2p but I think it'd be closer to 40-45m for 5p, a bit long
- not all the role selections are necessarily interesting every turn. Some feel dead ish of just constantly getting resources.

Will probably trade after playing this more and trying different factions.

The biggest issue is many turns a player will want to just collect resources and none of the options they choose will seem like one they wanna do - but they are selecting so they pick one anyway. I feel like a good role selection game should make all the roles tantalizing, which leads to better decision points of whether to collect resources or do the action. This one is like stockpile resources -> expand/research/build since war typically hurts both involved players. Also doubt the powers are that balanced and wish we could branch our tech trees or at least put them to more use. Not a bad game but not one i seek to play that much given also how some classes seem a bit imbalanced. But it is also usually close in some regard so I apprecaite that. Debating on trading atm.

Part of this trend of taking eurogames and miniaturizing them while retaining the eurofeel (Sail to India). The asymmetry will take several plays to figure out; the key seems to be in figuring out what your opponents are gunning for and how they are trying to trigger endgame, which requires good awareness of each starting race's character card. Which is kind of a lot of work for a game this quick.

The gameplay is in general interesting, but I have the feeling that your strategy is basically very stricly dictated by the race you have and there is not as much choice as I expected but it's more finding the strength of your race and then sticking with it. 

Also, while I like the "tiny" part of it in general, one big problem with that is that it is very tough to have an overview which abilities your opponents have and at least so far people constantly had to ask around who can actually do what, which is of course especially important when going to war.

心得:
遊戲卻是很有它們自己的味道
內容還OK
但是種族能力說實話是有點無聊
主要是能做的動作都太小了配合這些能力也沒讓遊戲感覺豐富點
且許多種族人少根本玩不起來
所以覺得普普的遊戲
規則:
*高塔行動卡放中間
*每人拿一組米寶，資源標記各一，一張隨機種族卡，一張隨機領土卡(自己選一面)，資源放1鐵2魔力3食物(之後可以總和6自己放)，高塔標記放卡下，兩個米寶放在自己領土的一個區域，隨機起始拿主動標記
*遊戲輪流有行動，有五個階段，直到遊戲結束
1.如果行動卡上放滿盾牌則移除
2.選一個沒盾牌的行動放盾牌
3.主動玩家執行選擇動作或pass，其他玩家則可做該行動或拿資源
>移動一個米寶到相鄰區域(同張卡片)，不能過水
>移動米寶從一張卡片到另外一張，要在該卡邊緣並進入另外張卡片邊緣
*不能移動到有兩個米寶所在位置，不能移動到該玩家唯一一隻米寶所在區域
*移動遇到其他玩家米寶進入戰鬥，兩人皆秘密拿一顆戰鬥骰選到要使用的面，數字大的獲勝，平手防守方獲勝，兩人都白棋則同盟都待在該區，根據骰面支付對應資源(扣掉增加戰鬥能力的)，魔力2鐵1食物0，輸的可支付同等場上自己米寶數的食物，撤退到相鄰合法無敵方區域，沒食物付就移除
*同盟只有在有兩個不同米寶在該區才有，可自由移動到同盟隊友區域無懲罰，如果同盟方有人發生戰爭，則結束後失敗者要移走所有同位置的米寶，撤隊每隻都要付一次，剩最後一隻就不移除一到最近沒被佔領的區域
>支付對應等級鐵來移動高塔標記一格，最多建1格
>支付對應等級魔力來提升魔法軌，一次一格
>支付場上自己米寶數+1個食物來放一個米寶進場，要放到有你米寶的位置
>交易 棄掉一種資源任意個換成另一種資源，只能做一次
>非主動玩家可選擇收集資源，每個有你米寶的區域產對應該區域的資源(看顏色)，資源上限9，剩一隻米寶時，可額外獲得一個任選資源
*水跟山不能通過，城市最後佔領有兩分(同盟一人1分)，進入廢墟要放倒，收集資源時立起來並拿一個任選資源，站著的收集資源不會拿到，可選正常移動把米寶站起但就沒有資源，遊戲結束時會米寶在此會移除
4.確認結束條件 7個米寶在場/塔到六層/魔法到5，三個條件任意達成即結束，進行到行動區擺滿為止
5.順時鐘傳遞主動玩家標記
*最後計分 每個場上米寶1分，魔法卡高塔等級對應分數，佔領的城市分數，平手照前面順位比最後在比資源數目
**變體 探索標記***
*洗勻探索標記並蓋著放到沒有人的區域，有人進去就打開結算
>皇冠拿走放到該玩家圖板上最後兩分，打輸要給別人
>寶藏 獲得兩個任意資源板塊棄掉
>土匪 棄兩個資源或是移除一個米寶，板塊棄掉
>龍穴 控制該區的如果打贏可選擇不移除米寶並不花費撤退改讓該輸家高塔降一級
>帳篷 該地點額外產一個該地的資源
>圍牆 蓋底額外獲得兩點戰力
>城鎮 額外一分
>教堂 控指者如果戰鬥輸了可移除該標記把米寶免費撤退到該區域(不能違反兩隻米寶上限原則)
**5人***
移除行動的該玩家不行動直接跳過，使用探索標記的話每人自己圖板放3個(空白的移除)
**2人**
放一個第三方領土卡，每一個區域放一個米寶，跟中立戰鬥是戰力要大於等於所有中立米寶數目，拿走該米寶最後值1分，2人遊戲不同盟，遊戲最後每個中立米寶1分，每個佔領的中立區域1分

A very tidy little game, packing excellent punch into a 30 minute slot. What makes the game tick is the concept of everytime someone takes an action, everyone else gets to do that same action or take resources. This allows everyone to be involved every turn, and allows you to setup the next bit you want to do quite quickly. My second like was the need to be careful when initiating movement and battles - you might get to sneak into a desired empty territory first as the chooser, but the person going last can judge exactly what to fight safely, so there's a nice balancing here. My third like was the variety offered by the different races, each with 5 different powers. Combined with the variety of different terrain to exploit / fight over each game, there's nice inter-game variety on offer. It's probably true that if two players are fighting then the only real winner is the person not fighting, which I'd have an issue with in a longer game, but I can happily live with it here given its lightness and length. Taking care on turn order, knowing when to fight and when to ally, knowing when to build vs save resources to spend on fights, taking advantage of powers, ... tick, tick, tick. Good stuff!

Excellent and meaty micro card game.

RATING: 7.5
It's not quite the 4X game I was hoping for, but it's still good. There can be some interesting choices to make; do I take an action to benefit myself (and allow others to follow) or take an action others may not be able to do since they are short of resources (just one example). I think the game is better at 3+ with 4 and 5 being the best. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
After one play it feels like you are fighting for a few points in the end. Since everyone executes every action there is no room for runaway or left behind. Usually this is good, but not if it diminishes the impact of your choices. I want a good player to be able to win big and a poor player to loose big. Now whatever you do, if you play the game, you will still only win or lose by a few points. 

After second play. I have to correct myself about win or lose by a few points, because you have to watch yourself, so you don't get stuck with no (or too few) resources when it's your turn to chose an action. If you do you will lose with a few more points. Especially with three players, since you then get to chose two actions in a row when resetting the action shields. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A game that has all the ingredients that I like - variable player powers, simultaneous action selection, no luck in battle mechanics but risky choices for sacrifice, action drafting and a fantasy theme - all in a small box that I can take to places.
and I have taken it places, and it's not been so much fun. The war ends up being very punitive, and harmful for those involved. The powers of factions are limiting instead of interesting. The end of the game trigger makes for awkward, slow calculation that are just not fun. 

In general, it feels like a bunch of good ideas that are mixed in a way that is not glued together well. There's some fun there, but the game doesn't feel like a 4x - you're not really building an empire/kingdom, you're just spreading some meeples around and progressing on the book scale. The tower is really boring but you have to do it or you'll be left behind. I really wanted to like this game - I kickstartred it, drank the cool-aid and was all aboard. But after a few plays, when the excitement wears off, it fell flat for me.

2 plays - Generally not a big fan of the tiny epic series, which are mechanically sound, but more ride on their novelty ('smallness') factor. The thinness of the card stock etc., in my opinion is actually detractor! The game play is okay, but nothing that isn't done as well (or better) in other (better produced) games! Happy to play, but not a first pick.

Based on one play: A very nice strategy game in a small box. I played with the expansion on my first play which seems to add enough and makes the decisions each turn tougher as there is more to think about, but still not a very complex game, just enough for a medium level strategy game. There is a fair amount of interaction and you get a character that gives each player some specific ability as they gain ressource to expand and level up. Quite enjoyed it.

The variety of races is fun... unfortunately they don't seem very balanced. Trading is under-powered, building is over-powered, and fighting a war only seems to benefit the players not involved, so there is very little reason to do so.

A unique take on the 4X genre of games as a 'micro game' filler. The way the action selection system works is pretty cool as it keeps the other players engaged. Lots of different races, but I'm not sure they were equally play tested as some seem much better than others. As with many non luck element games with open information, the end game becomes very anti-climatic

Core mechanism is Puerto Rico with regards to action selection, except you don't have a choice of which "buildings" (research in this game) to purchase.

What I fear that might end up happening is that there are few dominant strategies for each faction. However, many factions come in the box.

Drags a bit with five players. Would like to try this game with three or less.

RATING: N/A
Description: Tiny 4X, fantasy, Civilization building, fighting, diplomatic, area movement, area control, resource management, strategy game, with variable player powers and meeples on a tiny map.
Weight: Light to medium.
Number of players: 2 to 5. Best with 4.

Impression: The premise and promise of this game drew my attention. The idea of having small sized 4x fantasy epic civilization building game that is played fast is great, and I accepted it with reserve. It is almost all it represents but it is not bad at all. There are many races with different technology/powers you can research. Action selection works in an interesting way where one player selects one of the 6 available actions and everybody else can follow it, or collect resources. And there are many double sided terrain tiles to chose from. Artwork is very unappealing and could be done much much better, but overall it's a fun game that lived up to all of it's 4 x's.

Likes: Compact size. Different races with unique powers. Lot of terrain tiles. Action selection with everybody doing follow up (basically no downtime).

Dislikes: Relatively long game time with more players (but hey, it's tiny AND epic). Unappealing artwork (probably deliberate). Imbalanced combat system.

I was pleasantly surprised how easy this game was to learn and play.  My wife destroyed me in our first game because I over extended too early in the game.  Looking back I can see some obvious changes I would make.  It's easy to wrap your head around the strategy and all subsequent plays will be much better.

The small foot print works too.  I'll be bringing this game to our next dinner outing to play while waiting for the order.  Good stuff.

I played this at my local games club in July 2015 - still my only play to date - and found it quite interesting (although not compelling enough to rate higher than 7). I like the way it reduces a lot of elements of your typical engine-building-and-potentially-conflict-heavy "civ" game into a short playtime with very little downtime, and the asymmetrical player powers are something which I enjoyed, as I do in most games with this feature.

It took me four games but I've finally broken myself of buying the Tiny Epic games. The enthusiasm of the creators is infectious but none of the four that I got did anything special. Playing them feels not quite like a chore but definitely obligatory in a lot of ways. No one that I've introduced the games to has been excited about any of it - bland art, bland theme, bland components, bland mechanics. Tiny Epic Bland.

A pretty solid game for the time frame it plays. It plays quickly, but captures the feeling of progressing your civilization pretty well. The components are great and it is easy to teach. I wish the game was a larger scale production though as the miniature form factor is not necessary for me as I never wish I could fit my board games in the pockets of my pants.

Really good, small footprint, VP game. You have different races, like elf, dwarf, orc, etc and they all do different things. There's like 20 different races. You're trying to get the most VP by doing several different things. Lots of fun. This is a short 30 minute game and that is perfect for this game. i wish there was a little more too it so I could play it longer. It's too much fun to only last 30 minutes, but then again I could just play it again.

Tried this one again and lowered my rating further.  The idea of the race abilities is great, but for many of them, the abilities are very vanilla and never ever used.  Otherwise the game play is pretty boring - unlike games like Puerto Rico, rarely is there a time when you can choose an action that other players can't also use (because they don't have the resources), so scores are very close.  And there's usually no point battling - it only hurts those 2 players and helps the others. Just spread to 3 or 4 areas and double up.

Bought this on a whim when Tiny Epic Galaxies was out of stock at my store. Does not compare to Galaxies. The positives are the theme, art, and compact size of this game. The downsides are that the game moves relatively slowly and I simply don't find the mechanics all too much fun or intuitive. It's not that it's overly complex, it just is unnecessarily so.

This felt very prototype-y, like some mechanisms were tossed together as a learning exercise in game-making. Nothing feels overtly unbalanced because there isn't really much going on. The obnoxious label of "micro-game" is true in every sense - it's short, there isn't much to think about, and there is absolutely no emotional investment in anything that's going on - a microscopic game experience indeed.
Don't get me wrong. There are short games that belie depth, demand practice, and encourage creativity and strategic emergence over many plays, all with just a few components and rules. They are elegant and brilliant. This game is a mish-mash of "actions" that don't ever really gel or feel like viable parts of a strategy.

Addictive, interactive, thematic fun. Some of the race's powers are quite amusing, although only used once or twice per game, since the playing time is rather tiny too. Perhaps achieving two of the three victory conditions and then ending the game would make for a more conflict-oriented affair.  

A few too many Kickstarter emails from the publisher, but otherwise excellent production values and bang for the buck.

Not a bad little effort this one. Boils down a lot of the big game civ builder ideas into a small box game that seems nicely balanced. Unfortunately the age old problem arises where two players beat up each other and the third waltzes away for the win. It has potential though.

After TEG, this one left me a bit unimpressed. The set-up is neat, but all players felt little reason to attack each other as the combat in the game felt unnecessary and too random to make a strategic guess on what the situation would bring. 

It might be because my group generally plays a bit too 'euroy' (avoiding conflict and trying to set up a solid economy), which we felt wasn't the best way to play this game.

 This game delivers on its promise perfectly. It does a great job at capturing the 4X experience on a micro scale. All of the elements have been simplified or abstracted in a perfect way that works wonderfully in the context of the game. The action selection mechanism at the heart of this game works really well, and leads to lots of interesting choices. This really does deliver a lot of game in a small package.

I got a copy for Ultra Tiny Epic Kingdoms from Kickstarter.  The game is a bit different from it's [full sized?] variant, but not much.  I really love the super compact UTEK because I can take it anywhere and it still packs in a MASSIVE amount of strategy, thought, and super fun gameplay.  I play this equally with my 8-year-old twins and my colleagues at the office.

Decent little quick civ-style game. Plenty of different maps and factions do make for nice replayability, however, it does not seem that War pans out often enough and we always seem to end with someone reaching the end of the Magic track, so I do wonder about how diverse the strategies can really be.

RATING: 4
When I first saw this game I was very intrigued.  I remember it being advertised as a "micro game" though, which it certainly is not.  It is a small game but hardly a micro game in the same vein as Love Letter or Burgoo.  I think they just said it was a micro game because that's a big buzz word in the gaming industry right now.  Anyway, it intrigued me, it was pitched to me as a civilization game you can play in 30 minutes and it had a nice pile of races with special powers (especially since I played with the Kickstarter deluxe content).  Also, it is ADORABLE with all the little wooden books, corn, and stars...although perhaps dangerous to have around small children and pets.

Once I played it though the game seemed woefully incomplete.  I get the feeling that the designers designed all these neat races and the structure of what could be a reasonably entertaining game and then just never put forth the effort to finish it.  It honest-to-goodness does have some neat ideas and a nice base for what could be a great game but those ideas never go anywhere and there are some extremely broken issues with it because of that.

In this game each player has their own race and their own little plot of land with different landscape types on it.  Each turn a player selects one of the available actions and it is played follow-the-leader style with each other player choosing to do that action as well or producing.  This is, so far, very well designed.  It's everything after the neat action selection mechanics that falls apart for me.

The actions include moving, trading resources, buying a new meeple, leveling up your race, or building a tower for points.  When a meeple moves into a space with another meeple there is a war.  This is one of my biggest problems with the game.  Wars are so badly designed in this game.  I think they were going with simplicity since they wanted an excuse to call it a "micro game" but in the end all they get is a broken, pointless piece of the game.

First of all, wars are rarely even worth it to conduct.  You spend resources to fight a battle and if you win you kill your opponents meeeple.  That's it, no reward for you except setting an opponent back a small bit.  You get to occupy that space now as well but there never seemed to be a shortage of production spaces for each player without going to war.  But the lack of reward isn't the worst part.  The worst part is that after you win a war you're incredibly weak and the next player can just come in and wipe you out for a much smaller contribution.  This is further exacerbated by the follow-the-leader gameplay, you fight wars by moving and after you move every other player gets to move too.  Fighting a war just puts a huge target on your back so there's very little benefit to it.  So most games I can see wars being completely ignored, which is even more of a shame since many of the bonuses for the races have to do with war.  Not enough to make them worth it mind you, so those abilities are completely wasted.

My other big problem with this game is that for a "civilization" game there is an inherent best strategy very obvious from the get-go:  building the tower.  There are very few points to go around, which is something I'm not a big fan of to begin with, and most of the things that get you points are linear.  Every meeple equals one point.  Every level of magic equals one point.  However the 5th level of the tower is worth 7 points and the 6th is worth a whopping 10.  No resource is more or less rare than others and building the tower costs the same amount of resources and actions as buying more meeples or leveling up your race but has greater point rewards from level 5 on.  What a silly design decision to make one path to victory inherently and obviously better than the others.

I found solo play was a bit cumbersome. Didn't really like having to constantly move and collect resources for the opposing virtual player. I do admit that it began moving a whole lot quicker as I played the game and got used to it. I think the rating of a 6 for me is fitting. I will bring it out if I am in the mood. Maybe try and teach it to someone for some two player.

A TON of fun in a VERY small package. I like how portable this is and that I can play it almost anywhere. However, while it is right at home on a small cafe table, it is almost unplayable at a gaming meetup or on a dining room table. 

I like that it has the extra factions included in it. Most of these Tiny Epic games are very samey and while that is true of this and TEG, I will definitely keep this one around to play every so often.

[Gamelyn Games deluxe 2014 edition] {Fantasy; area-control, various-player-power, action-drafting; optimal 4p}  Tiny Epic Kindgoms is a fun fast game.  It's interactive and thematic.  Players have to plan carefully with the limited resources so that they can build and expand their civilisations.  This game only shines at 4p and that's my rating.

Since the game only has a small map.  War between 2 players may not be beneficial.  Once each players have spent resources in a war - they become vulnerable to upcoming wars.  So, in a game of more players, players need to be more careful to start a war, except wanting a peace.

Replayability is very good.  Players can choose factions and territory cards to have a setup each time.

The production quality is good.  I love the meeples and the graphical illustration is vivid.  The only problem is the territory cards, which are too busy for me.

Very nice game, impressed by the amount of 'game' it packs in a little package.

Benefits: plays VERY quick, fills up a unique niche (fast playing 4x).

Drawbacks: three main issues with it:
- Conflict is very costly and the map is simply not tight enough to 'force' some conflict. You can easily all coexist peacefully and never fight before the end. Because conflict is so costly, it doesn't work well as a 3p game.
- The person ahead on the building track will nearly always win, as the point difference to be had there will easily make up for any point loss on meeple and/or magic. As there is no hidden scoring mechanism, this will make it pointless for players running behind to end the game, even furthering the problem as the building gap widens at the end. 
- Because of the lack of hidden scores, end-game is mathy and unfun, and might result in hideous kingmaking. Being a short game isn't enough to redeem for that.

Have not played with the expansion yet, but it seems to alleviate the 'tower' problem a bit by giving other point exploring opportunities. Plus, player experience will alleviate that problem as well. 

As for hidden scores, I've created the variant:
"Expansion markers are not automatically flipped (except Crown of Valor and Bandits), instead they may remain hidden. Hidden non-blank markers can be flipped open upon Patrolling or Questing into the region, after they will give their usual effects. Hidden markers do not give any 
usual benefits, but any non-blank hidden marker is revealed at the end of the game and gives 0.5 bonus points to whatever player is solely controlling a region the marker is in, rounding up any total fraction."

This adds a whole tactical layer of information and uses and will make the end-game a tense affair without kingmaking, bringing the game into a good solid '8' in my book.

This is going to need more plays for us to get behind; so in the fence. Didn't help that we had some rule confusion between out 1st/ KS edition and the rules walk through with 2nd ed. I think I am going to get the 2nd ed rules and just make those the rules we use in the future. 

We did like the quick play and the wide variety of options the different race cards provide. We also plan on adding the KS bonus pips to future plays.

Increasingly I'm finding that I'm be more impressed with a game if I only owned 10 games - or maybe if I'd only played 100.

TEK offered very little that was new. War seemed to be fairly rare and rarely worthwhile, trading really does nothing for you as just simply producing resources is always better unless you've already essentially been eliminated from the game and there's little to reward good play or punish poor. As such it seemed very much as though everyone was going to score a similar amount of points and one or two actions would make the difference.

Sadly, just a bit mediocre. Which is pretty good by Kickstarter standards.

I grow tired of short fast games with some decisions to be made. 

That being said, this is one of the better ones, there are some interesting decisions to be made, but lack of actions and time don't really give people chances to separate and give you the epic feel of great games.

It falls short, but it's fast enough that I'll play it.

This was a Kickstarter game that I was kind of unsure about. I love the concept, but I wasn't sold on the mechanics - particularly how war worked. I need to get more plays before I can make an accurate judgement, but after 1 play I feel optimistic. The role selection mechanic with dissenting was similar to Eminent Domain and I enjoy that. A big selling point for me was the wide variety of races and I love how differently they feel. None of us went for the tower at all because we didn't have races that benefited from tower construction. I'm still not sold on the war mechanic, but it wasn't as bad as I feared. I like how alliances work, because if one person offers an alliance but the other doesn't, the peaceful side loses. It's very much a prisoner's dilemma. I backstabbed Andy after he offered me peace (I didn't trust him). Then he backstabbed his wife after she offered him peace (he was just being a jerk). Our wives were very peaceful and shared alliances together. Pretty good game that has potential. Bonus points for being so small. So far this is a Kickstarter that I don't regret.

RATING: 7.3
A really tiny EPIC game - don't get fooled by the small box, this is not a simple filler game; it is a full riped strategy game with interesting decisions to make, but I fear it has some balancing issues and sometimes feels a little fiddly. I really recommend to play with the "Heroe's Call"-expansion, which smoothens some of the issue and really spices up the game.

This has turned out to be a little disappointing. Great components and production, but unless war seems to be ultimately self defeating, which cuts the player interaction. Fits in a really small box though, and so likely to be carried around, not a top favorite though.

I really enjoy this small take on a 4x-style game. The different faction powers are what really make it though; they really serve to shape your strategy. Hard to recommend if you will exclusively play 2 players though; I feel it would thrive in the 3-4 range.

Just good clean fun, simple game and rules but with some nice depth depending on the group you play with. Best part is it plays fast, quick setup, play, and take down. Can't ask for more in such a tiny package!

It is possible I could learn to like this game but after playing it a bit I found it lacked any real feeling of fun.  It was tactical and such but I just didn't find the game at all enjoyable and without that element of fun I had no real reason to play it more.

RATING: 5
Initial plays are very encouraging. The action selection mechanism, similar to that of Puerto Rico, is one of my favorites and it's the main mechanic of TEK. The different races all play a little differently and seem like they'll add a ton of variety.

Update: The expansion and second edition content really helps improve the game greatly. Aside from just the huge amount of new factions and terrain, the new elements (war towers and heroes) really make for more interesting decisions.

However, I've realized that the game just isn't very exciting and I would rather play just about anything else.

For the record I have only played this solo.  I felt like maybe I was missing something.  It didn't really feel like much of a game I guess.  Instructions were very unclear, had to watch a couple of Youtube videos to figure out the stupid clock mechanic for when the AI invaded or scouted.  Plus while I get that they wanted to keep the packaging tiny?  Making the solo version require a not-included 12-sided die is kinda not cool.

Culled - Second wave; Charity auction

Why we culled it: It took me a while to get over the whole "Tiny Epic" craze, but I've finally been able to make peace with my compulsive-collector demons and evaluate the games on their own merits. TEK is a pretty cool and innovative take on the civ-building genre, but at the end of the day, I would almost always prefer to spend my civ-building time with something less abstract and restricted - the unique civ developments are a great idea from the footprint perspective and it works well here, but it does strip out a lot of that empire-growth charm of a proper civ-builder. In the end, TEK is too much for a travel game and not enough for a home game. It remains very novel, and I'm sure it will have no problem finding the right home.

Technically I played "Ultra-Tiny Epic Kingdoms" but I think other than the size and some scaled down components, it is essentially the same game.

Each player gets two cards, one of which is your race (with special abilities) and the other which is your map. The whole game is essentially about putting cubes on the map, and bumping up your mana-powers and building towers. Each one of those things you do gets you a point at the end of the game. And the game ends when someone maxes out their mana-powers, tower or people on the board.

There's six actions you can take. Each player puts a cube on an action when they use it blocking it off until five cubes have been placed. Then those cubes flush and you begin again. Every other player has the option to follow your action or harvest (producing a good for every region where they have people). As the active player you can't ever harvest. If you're forced to initiate an action you can't do, it's simply a wasted turn for you, but everyone else can follow your action.

The actions are place a dude in a region you're in by spending food = to total worker count after the placement (only 2 dudes in any region ever), moving dudes (either adjacent to where they are or to an outside spot on another map card), increasing your mana powers by spending mana = the next level's cost, building a tower level by spending ore = the next level's cost, or trading one good for another (but any number of times between those two goods).

There's also a war conflict that can happen when you move into a region with another player. You blindly bid some amount of resources to kill the opponent or spend nothing to be a pacifist and make an alliance (if they don't betray you). If you do battle, it triggers a war between the two players wherever they may already be in the same regions.

A large part of the game is being efficient in following actions and making sure you have the appropriate resources at the right time. The races make it a little interesting, and there's a fair number of them.

The ultra-tiny version has a very small footprint. It's a good bit of game for the size, but it's definitely not a main course game. I'd play it while waiting to play something else, but I doubt I'd really seek it out.

An interesting concept, shrink down a 4x game until you either get the most complex small game ever or the smallest complex game ever. Touches it's nose to the wall of having enough going on that it's not quite a super filler, but isn't really overstuffed either. A remarkable design, to be certain, but one that I more admire than enjoy.

Deluxe Ultra-Tiny Kickstarter. This was a cheap entry point to see what the fuss was all about, and the game seems solid after reading the rules. The solo game is okay, but I doubt I'll be playing it often. 2 player was decent; the Lost Kingdom certainly helped to make things a bit more interesting. I'm fully aware it may have been us, but there wasn't much conflict in the 2 player game, more of a points race. It played well enough with 2, but I'm guessing 3-5 may be needed for a more interesting game. It's a good game to begin/end an evening of games with.  

The bag to store the game and die is a nice touch, and I didn't think the box sleeve was going to get used, but it looks nice on the box.

Free Print-and-Play edition (WiP). The game is too unforgiving. Seems 4P is the sweet spot (just to make war work)... there isn't really a shortage of resources for most of the game, especially two player (and it isn't really fun).

Making a bigger action selection card.
Standard sized eurocubes work just fine.

(Dec 2014 after 1 5p game) - A decent filler with some player interaction and you should be involved on each turn as you either follow the role, or produce resources.

Micro 4x euro. Variable player power tech tree. Worker placement with follow actions. Control of territory for resources and victory points. End game triggered when all meeples are placed or tower is completed. It can get mean in negotiated combat. In fact, the game is at its best when there is a lot of table talk negotiation and banter trying to influence and getting burned by betrayal. I've always been intrigued by games that provide big game experience from a small package like this one does. I love that there are so many different races with unique abilities to explore. One of our favorite travel games and it plays under an hour.

Fun little game. But the game's main strength of being "tiny" and playable anywhere etc. is also its weakness, in the sense that I would almost never pick TEK in any other situation. It's unfair because TEK is a good game on its own, but when I´m at home I largely prefer to immerse myself in the game by looking at a huge map, moving components instead of grabbing tiny pieces of meeples. On the plus side I really appreciate the fact we can have a good game in a tiny box, if you compare with the vast majority of crappy games in huge boxes you can't store unless you have a lot of room.

There is too much here for my to consider it a Micro-Game... but Tiny Epic Kingdoms is a great looking, civ building filler!  It packs some nice resource management and strategic decisions available and there is a ton of replayability thanks to all that extra content from the kickstarter.  Still, while it works perfectly well its also very not exciting and I traded my copy away as I have quite a few games I'd prefer to play at this general depth and length.

Quick game with some nice mechanics in it. Prefer playing the plain version as opposed to playing it with the expansion.

Interesting concepts and an impressively small package, but the combat system was confusing to some players. I would play it again now that I have a better grasp on how much to actually commit to combat, but it just didn't excite me on the first play.

A good "pub" game, Fast and Easy

ITA: Un buon gioco, rientra nei riempitivi una partita dura 15 - 20 minuti. Ma rientra nello strategico/colleziona risorse, le mappe per il gioco potevano essere fatte con una grafica più comprensiva (magari aggiungendo delle semplici frecce per indicare le direzioni di movimento)

Excelletn area control/action limited game.  Really like how much differentiation there is for such a small package.  Great value and surprisingly cut-throat.

Clever 4X (eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, eXterminate) where the "exploration" is pretty minimal. Different races have different strengths. Family Friendly.

Gran juego que cumple justo lo que ofrece: ser un pequeño juego de reinos que puede jugarse en media hora. Hasta 13 razas fantásticas diferentes cada una con habilidades propias especiales y 16 mapas diferentes hacen que sea muy rejugable. Conquistas, avances en tecnologías, construcción de una maravilla y recolección de recursos todo ello en una pequeña cajita.

This game is surprisingly good!  It hits all the necessary notes, yet shears off all of the "fluff" and gets right down to the core.

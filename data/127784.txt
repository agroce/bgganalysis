Found this at target and was pleasantly surprised by this hanging dexterity game. Rods with specific indentations are hung from eachother until it collapses. While not my favorite stacking game, this one isn't bad, especially for being from a big name store.

Unfortunately only really suitable for early elementary school age. Everyone else has an instinctive grasp of gravity, friction and pendulums. 

If the rods were (or could be) weakly magnetized with distinct poles (they can't, they are some paramagnetic alloy) then there would at least be a force that would have to be tested while playing and the total integrity of the structure would be less predictable. 

Even if the bars weren't all straight (I haven't experimented, but I think these alloys are crystalline enough that they will break under force rather than bend) the pendulum action wouldn't be as easy to predict.

Unfortunately, there just isn't enough in the game as is to make it worth the time, even with two sets and the "pool of points" variant.

Run of the mill dex/tower building game. No better than most of its ilk and a little worse in some ways (e.g., in our first game someone won because I rolled a Green and the only one left on the table belonged to the guy with only 1 bar. What? C'mon.)

I like this game concept a lot, but the rules are a bit rough. We play the intermediate game with house rules that if you roll a color you don't have, you get to pick one from an opponent to play, and if successful, trade one of your pieces for the one you played.

Reminds me of Hamsterrolle in the mechanisms. I quite liked the game we first played (wrong rules) when we were allowed to use occupies grooves. Quite a chilled collaborative building experience.

The real rules were a bit annoying and the die unecessary. I'd buy it though, since it's easier to fit in a bag.

A balancing Jenga-type dexterity game with funky metal rods.  

See my pictorial review: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/1941073

Very fun, but does need some house-rules to make it more satisfying for gamers, otherwise the die used to choose the colour rod becomes too important.

For example, Daniel Cluley suggests a [thread=1944236]Swap Variant[/thread] 
 (originally [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/article/27053037#27053037]here[/url]): "[i]If you roll a color you don't have, you get to pick one from an opponent to play, and if successful, trade one of your pieces for the one you played.[/i]" Kirk Roberts has come up with a [thread=1862586]Color Force variant[/thread] which seems quite good, and perhaps even better is the [thread=1367054]Pool of Points variant[/thread] from VaultBoy. 

Others have suggested being able to place your final piece without needing to roll.  Another suggestion found online: "To counterbalance the luck factor, I'd recommend that if you only have 1 piece left, you're allowed to place it without rolling. Also, if you roll a color for a piece you do not have, but your opponent does have, they're not allowed to place it if it's their last piece. Lastly, since whomever went first is at a tempo advantage, we implemented a "rebuttal" rule that allows everyone who has 1 piece remaining a chance at a shared victory.﻿"

None of this will probably matter to non-gamers, but I can understand that gamers will want a fairer set of rules that rewards skill and mitigates the dice-rolling.

RATING: 5
Not too bad, but the dice rolling kind of takes away a lot of the skill that could be involved. There is still a lot of room for a good player to win, though.

Here's a quick and easy dexterity game based on balancing.  What makes this one so great is how quick it is to play and jump play several games and get lots of different results.  We enjoy playing with the die as it adds a little bit of luck in with the strategy of placing the wires.

My kiddo got this as a gift, but it's not just a kids' game. I'll play just about anything she enjoys, but this is one I'd also break out in a group of grown-ups.

There are several difficulty levels, and the basic rules are solid. It's pretty easy to get the structure rolling, but it turns into a hot mess quickly -- and one bad move can bring every piece down, too.

I'm not wild about the novelty tube packaging, but the game is excellent.

---

The die needs a different symbol for each color. The game can run a bit long with two if it flips back and forth with big piece dumps.

Apart from those two minor dings, this is an excellent game. The physics involved is really enjoyable.

---

Thought the "biggest to smallest" version would be easier than rolling, but it's harder!

We use the Animal Upon Animal rule for falls: Pick up your piece and two others of your choice, at most.

---

After 15 plays, re-rated from an 8 to a 7. Still enjoyable, but there isn't a lot of depth and variety in the gameplay.

Silly balance game. Only gripe is that it can drag on if multiple jokers end up knocking it down a lot. But then again it's easy to just set aside if the group feels done with it.

You have to work pretty hard to make this game difficult for your opponents. Easy placements are easy to handle. Much of the joy comes just from seeing what you've built and witnessing the physics of this mass swing around with each new piece. Very enjoyable.

This is pretty stressful but a lot of fun! I do think that it's weird though that you have to play other players' pieces if you don't have that color [since playing a color is luck-based by rolling]. Why would I want to help my opponent??

The game is fine. I'd play it if asked. It's really weird that if you roll a color you don't have you have to take an available piece from a different player and successfully place it, effectively helping them win the game. I don't like that rule. But it's fun to see how it sways back and forth. I don't know how this particular version of this sort of balancing game became the mass market success, though. I guess because this is the only one that a place like Target chose to put up for sale.

Clever game of balancing wires of various lengths. While playing, I dubbed it "The Coat Hanger Game," and although the wires have no hooks, I still think the description gives you a feel for what it's like. You can play conservatively or aggressively by balancing your wires in the middle or on the edge. If you make the wires tumble, you have to add the ones that fell to your pile. First one to get rid of all their wires wins. It's fun until everyone has one or two wires left, when the roll of the dice determines the winner instead of skill. On your turn, if you don't roll your color, you do nothing -- or worse, you may have to help your opponent. I'd be more frustrated if the game wasn't so short, and so silly. That said, it doesn't have much staying power after the first handful of plays. I'll gladly participate if someone pulls out a copy, but (of all things) I think the game needs a bit more development.

Good idea with nice pieces, but the game is a little too easy.  It's pretty simple to create a very solid structure, and at a certain point in time it's nearly impossible to disturb much, because the pieces are too interwoven to move much.  Might be possible with more play to make it harder for your opponents, but I'm not sure about that.

It's a forgone conclusion that every 10-minute dexterity game will receive a 6-7 rating from me, even though I'd never suggest a game and there's a chance that I'll never actually play it again.

[i]Suspend[/i] is like all other "pretty good" dexterity games, except that it requires players to use marshmallow roasters with bumps, notches, and pretty colors.

Note: "Pretty good" is my highest possible dexterity rating, which can be useful or not depending on your philosophical leanings and the degree to which my cranium filling overlaps with yours.

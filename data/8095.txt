GAME: Prophecy
RANK: 1410
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A lot of people around here like to compare Prophecy to Talisman, which makes a lot of sense - in fact, the distribution company (Altar) that was in charge of distributing the Czech version of Talisman made Prophecy only because their rights to Talisman had expired. Think of Prophecy as Talisman 2.0 - it keeps some of Talisman's key concepts like Strength and Craft (Willpower) or combat mechanisms, but improves on its many shortcomings. Namely, the game doesn't take 4+ hours to finish, it's faster paced, it relies heavily on your own decisions and not just luck (e.g. you have absolute freedom of movement), and it's much more well-balanced. In many ways, it's Talisman like it should have been from the beginning, but with many original ideas as well (movement, skills, life and magic system, Astral Planes).  
However, there is something lacking in Prophecy - I think it's the very spirit of the game. When I play Talisman, I always become completely immersed in a fantasy world. Playing Prophecy, on the other hand, feels just like playing a generic RPG game. I blame the visual style for the most part - the digital, airbrushed look of Prophecy is no match for the beautiful hand-drawn illustrations of the 2nd edition of Talisman. The terse, to the point descriptions on cards also contribute to this: the game tells you all you need to know and nothing more, leaving no room for world building and immersion. I also wish there were more Adventure cards as the game can get repetitive once you get to know all of them. Talisman just feels richer, even if it doesn't really work as a game. For those reasons, I can't give Prophecy the highest rating, but it's still one of my favourite boardgames and I highly recommend trying it, especially if you're a fan of the RPG genre.

RATING: 7
A very sweet gift from Chris.  I really enjoy these types of games, but often feel that the most exciting and fun part is the beginning.  The end game is pretty boring, and I don't enjoy the basically forced PvP.  I have yet to try the expanded rules that make the game take longer (joy), but I think I'd like them, since they prolong that beginning part of the game.  What I can't stand is towards the end when most of the characters are strong enough through equipment or good encounters to breeze through 90% of the monsters on the board.  What seems so promising and exciting quickly gets lame as you uncover the final bosses and defeat them with little challenge or danger.  I'd love to find a way to make this cooperative, but to accomplish that, the board would have to be much more difficult, and such drastic changes would be really alien to the nature of the game.  I'm guessing Arkham Horror will scratch this particular itch.  Also, a lot of the guild abilities just don't seem to be that good--would love to see some variants of more useful abilities.

Among Runebound, Return of the Heroes, Talisman, and Prophecy, I like Prophecy the best. More theme than Runebound and better mechanics than Return of the Heroes or Talisman. If you prefer a shorter game, try my variant with the character starting kits.

RATING: 8.6
(Z-Man edition) This is a very good adventure RPG and borders on excellent (just wished it played a wee quicker). I've only played a few of the more popular games (Talisman, Return of the Heroes) and this game places in front of these others on my play list. It forces players to make some tricky choices about where to best spend their time and how to get to the best places ahead of your competitors. Some random thoughts:

Guild abilities may look sort of weak on the surface but this game is about the little choices that make up a character. Yes, you need to level up in order to beat the various Guardians and gather the artifacts but you need to battle through many monsters and get the jump on your competitors. This is where the items and abilities come in. They round out your character and give them the tools to win the little battles while all the time looking to level up for the final larger battles. 

The game board looks a little small and cramped to start (compared to say Talisman) but it doesn't take long to realize that you don't move to places all the quickly or easily and the distances are greater than first imagined.  

The starting differences of strength and willpower of the various game characters is small. At the start, you are either balanced or stronger in one or the other. But don't let that fool you. It isn't easy to level up on these two important stats so you need to think out a course of action in terms of where to focus your gains. Balanced characters may actually have the hardest time because they are forced to choose a path where the unbalanced characters mostly have the path chosen for them.

The game pieces are of high quality with a mix of cardboard and wood pieces. The cards are small but readable and the quality of material is high. The artwork meshes well with the theme and enhances the overall gameplay.

Overall, I'm really impressed with this game. It has a lot to offer and future expansions will keep this game fresh for years to come.

A bit long for what it is. To be honest, it is a tad boring after a while. More chance cards might be an improvement. Perhaps I'm missing the point a bit?

RATING: 3
A failed attempt to "Euro-ize" Talisman.  Imagine that classic game played on a smaller board while stripped of surprise and character idividuality.  And it doesn't even take any less time to play.

Prophecy attempts to infuse its adventure game substrate with determinism and strategy, but only manages to do so in a bland and superficial manner.  If you want a fantasy based strategy game go some where else.  If you want surprise and adventure, play Talisman.  Prophecy attempts to be two things at once and fails to be anything worth while.

This one has it for me in the line of adventure board game. It's paced better than Runebound and has better mechanics than Talisman. It lacks both of them in pure flavor, but still, it plays really well. However, now that I own and play Tomb, this one might never see another play. Sold it.

New Zman edition. We started it once (not finished) and it gets some of role-playing ideas of growing up your character but don't know if could get repetitive. Played twice. It's a good adventure and fantasy game with some ideas of role-playing. It took three hours to finish with only 2 artifacts. Want to play more.
2016: sfter playing more it seems enjoyable. Good game.

RATING: 7.5
Nice character based adventure game. The characters aren't very differentiated but the acquisition of items throughout the game does give everyone unique abilities. Not an overly long or complicated game. In many ways it is a very comparable game to Return of the Heroes. Just make sure you don't play with more than 4 players and play until one character gets two artifacts. Otherwise the game can get too long.

RATING: 7.25
Enjoy leveling up characters.  Would like to see some more difference between characters other than home guilds and starting red/blue cubes because by the end of the game all characters are essentially the same and the winner is simply the person who was able to level up the fastest which can depend on the luck of the draw.

RATING: 7
Very playable fantasy adventure with more than a dash of Talisman. Fortunately, Prophecy plays much faster. Good decisions to be made every turn facilitated by improved movement rules (spending additional resources to move faster and connected movement spaces.) Rules and components are in English, and while you can tell they are translated, the translation is very good. Cards and dice add randomness, but good strategy wins over bad strategy. Highly recommended (especially if you are nostalgic for Talisman.)

This is a fun adventure game that is more elegant than most of its kind. I think this was the first game I played that used little wooden cubes to keep track of things on the player boards, something that is now ubiquitous. The end game - the astral planes and artifacts - is great, and leads to some much needed back-stabbing.

RATING: 6
Great production, very decent rules, played well with two.  We let it go way too long the first time because we didn't realize how achievable the endgame goals were and could shave a bunch of playtime off it.  Still, without variants it's very easily a 2+ hour game and leaning toward 3+.  Seems like starting with more gold/experience and possibly some basic items might be a good idea.  The enemies and such have awesome little thematic touches, and the Clover Meadow, cursed mummy, and lion in particular are just completely awesome.  Haven't played Talisman or Runebound, may like it better than Return of the Heroes.  Not enough to justify the time for me, though - and I never mind playing an epic game of Through the Ages, just to show I don't have gamer ADD.

This game is tauted as a Talisman lite and it lives up to the rep.  Whether playing the basic or full version of the game, it is important to remember that you may acquier items, skills, and health by visiting key locations - that is, advancement is not limited to defeating creatures.  I was surprised by the speed in which the game plays.  There can be some down time when things are going poorly, but overall the game delivers on a character building RPG type game.  The board is well illustrated, but it is not a dungen crawl immersive style board.  If you have the itch to see a character advance and take on evil, this is a good selection if you want to do it in under 2 hours.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
12/17/11: Rating is based upon initial play of the basic game.  A nice adventure with unique characters and leveling abilities.  Described by many as Talisman with actual choices.  I personally like it, but can understand why many don't.  

One complaint is that the board is cluttered, and will all your different acquired possessions, it does become clunky to add up all your bonuses at the end.  That said, I don't know of any similar games that don't also have warts.

A lot of small print on cards that is somewhat difficult to read.

Definitely a luck based game, but hopefully your choices help control and minimize this.

I would say that three players is the sweet spot for this game, with four the downtime does start to become noticeable.  3 hours for a game sounds about right.  The endgame may be a bit of a letdown, and this may be more about the experience than the game conclusion.

Finally get Prophecy onto the table.  It had been on the shelf at least three years unplayed, so it was due an outing.  Soon realised I was playing Talisman but without the familiarity and excitement.  Undoubtedly a better balanced game than Talisman.  But then it’s the ups and downs that make Talisman fun.  Slightly surprised that a game that is so similar can be published.  If I want to play this type of game I’d probably stick with Talisman.

Vlaada made a masterfully balanced adventure game, which could very well be a disguised resource management-development game. Quality of components is top notch, but although playful and robust the artwork does not reach the standards of fantasy flight games.

Very much enjoy this one, its light-hearted, and that first play through has enough dread to really make you feel the sense of it. It was not so tough that either of us dies first time through (beginners game at wife's behest) but we got roughed up, and felt good about our progress. The design holds up really well and to me is actually a shining example of the genre. I wanted a copy since I saw the video review on BGWS, and of course love runebound, also the Tom Vassel mention of it had me wanting to play. When I ran across it late in the day at the TGD bazaar I knew I had to get it home, I will not regret this, and look forward to more multiplayer plays.

RATING: 6.7
Great fantasy themed game where you get stronger and stronger until you are strong enough to conquer the long lost artifacts. Can have a bit of a runaway leader problem as every creature defeated basicly gives you an advantage in the rest of the game. So if you're unlucky in the beginning you tend to get behind. Other than that the game is really streamlined and flows like a charm. I esspecially like the way strength/health and willpower/magic is handled. One last problem is that, allthough it's much quicker than talisman, it still can take 3 to 4 hours where 2 to 3 would be ideal. Component quality is below par.

Playing time really proved to be a problem in getting it to the table. So I traded it away.

Often compared to Talisman, this involves less luck, as you have control over your movement but there is still a fair bit of randomness.  Maybe it's my nostalgia for Talisman, but this game just seems less charming than Talisman.  It's oodles less frustrating, and there's a lot to love, but it leaves me a bit cold.  This game also seems to drag on and on in the last half as the cards repeat themselves.

RATING: 5
Why?  Why play this game when you can play World of Warcraft or, more desirably, D&D or some other true RPG?  Prophecy and its ilk take the trappings of an RPG—experience, gold, items—and build a game around it all the while ignoring the actual fun part of RPGs.  

So admitting that I am not too keen on the actual idea of the game, I must further admit that it actually fulfills its intent quite well.  I have some problems with the pacing, however.  The beginning is quite slow and very important, yet it mostly depends on luck in finding good encounters or rolling well.  There is actually a fair bit of a run-away leader problem in Prophecy.  Secondly, the player interaction is miniscule until the PvP section of the endgame.  Unfortunately, if the game actually reaches PvP than it has gone on far too long.  Other than that, gathering strength and willpower and some cool new items is pretty fun.  I have serious doubts about the balance of the various abilities, but as long as everyone is aware of the good ones it works out alright.

Okay, you can put Talisman away. Really! This game takes everything you like about Talisman (weird characters, weirder things to fight, getting the weirdest things that ultimately mark you as Weirdest Badass in WeirdWorld) and drops out all the things you don't (limited choices, tedious progress, and endless playtime) and allows the good parts to run their course in about two hours of play. And while there are more and better decisons to make and paths to take, it's still a joyously simple game to play. I should warn that this game has luck by the wagonload and that could affect replayability. Not for the A/P prone or "skill" sharks.

Sort of talisman for the new generation :)

What you'd expect from an adventure boardgame. Start with your basic character, go around finding stuff and fighting monsters, get experience, get cash - buy better equipment. You have a bit more control over movement - and you can tailor the game to reduce playing time if you like (for example forget the end game final battle, just play for holding a majority of the artifacts).

Overall quite like it, definitely prefer it over Return of the Heroes and Talisman.

It has the Talisman feeling, but gets rid of the dice movement. Also the character development is much more in control with outlying Skills to purchase.

I have never played Talisman...

This game feels like a production game to me in that you are buying and otherwise acquiring skills etc. to go for the bigger points as the game continues. 

It also has a press-your-luck feeling to it since there are cards and events that will happen that can cause you to lose gold but will reward you for being poor. 

The theme is pure fantasy and it's well integrated with the game.

*I'm impressed with how well this scales to 2 players.

If you like Talisman or Runebound or any of the other fantasy adventure style games, this might be your cup of tea.  Better movement rules than either of those, making for more interesting decisions.  Game is just as long, however, and downtime boredom is an issue.  Another problem is the fiddly thing of constantly putting various cards on a crowded board.  Lacks the charming art of Talisman.  Devoid of interaction until the endgame, but that means 3  hours of mostly soloplay.  Don't take this as catty, I'm sincere:       this game might be terrific for a group of 12 year olds.

Prophecy was a long time coming for us.  We played Runebound and got sick of the grinding and length.  We played Talisman and did not enjoy the roll-and-move sameness of it.  We played Return of the Heroes and liked it, but it's a pick-up-and-deliver logistics game, not an adventure game, and it was slightly too generic.  Prophecy looked the worst of any of them - perhaps I was prejudiced because it was always on sale for $10 somewhere, and there were always manifold copies floating around in the math trades.  So I avoided it - until we'd exhausted all the other games like it.  Then it went out of print.  Damn!  Cursing myself for not picking up a copy cheap, I waited and waited until I finally got a used Altar version of the game for $10.  

So how is it?  It's very good.  For me, this game takes the ideas behind Talisman and puts them in a pretty good Euro framework.  The ideas are basically the same as in other adventure games - wander the world (a circle, in this case) improving your character until you are advanced enough to take on the assorted baddies floating in the nearby wormholes.  And as in Talisman, you can see the endpoint of the game from the beginning (there are only 5 baddies in the game, so it's more about knowing who is where rather than who is who).  But instead of roll-and-move hell, this game utilizes a few Euro mechanisms to ensure that the game is enjoyable.

What are these mechanisms?  Well, one problem in many adventure games is grinding.  You repeatedly slay creatures to level up, but this is boring, and what's more, random, so that you often wind up getting beat down by a creature you were too green to take on.  It's all too easy to get beaten down, lose items/gold, and have to start over again.  Prophecy deals with this by way of a fate deck that gets turned over every turn.  The deck populates the board with encounters, and also gives out random goodies (such as gold, or health, or experience).  This random distribution helps keep everyone in the game, and lessens the need for grinding.  Another problem in many such games is that you tend to get locked into one mode of dealing with threats, as befits the character you're playing (Barbarians fight, Wizards use magic, etc).  This is all fine until you run into upper-level baddies of the opposite type.  In Prophecy, the characters are quite general and undefined, having either an edge in magic or strength.  Otherwise, it is up to you to customize the character by spending your experience at various guilds to obtain specific one-of-a-kind abilites.  This ability to customize your character gives the game real  legs, as there is competition for some abilites, and you can craft a character to fit the needs of the encounters on the board.  With 10 abilities per guild, and 5 guilds, you will be having some very interesting individual characters.  

Most importantly, you can see the end-game of this one from the beginning.  The boss monsters are not too much tougher than the average board monsters, so it becomes about who economized their actions and upgrades the best rather than a random "I happened upon this card before you did" experience that many adventure games provide.  Plus, you need a majority of the artifacts these bosses posses to win, so it ensures competition and late game struggles.  It also helps balance the game and ensure that everyone is in it to the end.  Because the game plays out like a heavily themed 2 hour Euro, you feel like you can actually strategize to some degree, which is rare in this type of game.  On the other hand, I felt like it had just as much theme as Talisman, and felt like adventuring.  For us, this is the fantasy/adventure game that will stay and get played (I only wish the Z-Man expansion was compatible my Altar set).

RATING: 7
Very good rethinking of Talisman that is better than Talisman in many ways.  Still suffers from the one major drawback: playing time.  Takes at least 1 hour per player.  That is a significant time investment for a game that is basically "roll high you win, roll low you lose".  I enjoy it though, in moderation.

Don't play the basic game; there's no reason to do it.  Anyway, not my usual kind of game, but this was really fun, really good looking, and really easy to learn.  However, I would never play with anything other than 2-3 players, and I like Frank Branham's play-to-2-artifacts endgame change.  My second game with 2 players took 2 hours to 2 artifacts.  Three artifacts would be OK, too, I think, with a small number of players.

Well, Prophecy is better than Talisman. That's pretty much damning it with faint praise. To be fair, we played this during the hustle and bustle of a convention with five players. It took quite some time... approaching three hours, and we finally cried "uncle" and gave the winner to the first person that won an artifact.

Moving around, collecting stuff, rolling dice to fight creatures... this might not be my style of game. I appreciate the Euro mechanics added to Talisman, but the result is still a bit too long and too repetitive for me at least.

Only played once.  Sort of a Talisman/Runebound hybrid.  I remember enjoying it, but for some reason it hasn't hit the table in a long time.  Part of that might be my learning of Magic Realm, which is probably my favorite of the board role-playing games at the moment.  But I do think this is a solid effort in a genre I like, so I'm sure I'll play it again at some point and have some more thoughts.

RATING: 4
I was going to rate this game a 5, because it really is inoffensive, and plays with some decent speed for its genre, but the truth is that I do find it a little on the boring side, and I have to knock the rating a bit because of that.

Prophecy is basically a dungeon crawl, hack and slash kind of affair. Anyone who played D&D in their youth will probably enjoy the theme here, I definitely did...the flavour in this game is easily the best part of it.

The game is basically all about wandering around, hacking up monsters, collecting skills and treasures, and then attempting to take out the guardians of the ancient artifacts of untold power, or something to that effect. The real game behind all of this works well enough, but, as seems to be common with these heavily themed affairs, it takes forever to do things, particularly because healing either of your stats generally takes at least a turn or two, as well as the turn or two taken to get to the healing area, and so on. Gold is also incredibly important, and in the early game it seems that getting it is largely dependent on having some easy pickings show up in the adjacent neighbourhood. On the plus end of things, combat is relatively fast and painless here, though certain monster types, particularly the 3 life specials, really require either an overwhelming statistical advantage or amazing luck to best. The overall balance here seems decently good though, and the game length isn't bad...about 2 hours or so.

The bottom line though, is that this just doesn't have enough actual meat on it for me to like it. The theme is cute, but it isn't enough to carry the otherwise thoroughly average gameplay for me.

Ok adventure game - the movement system is great but there's a lot of time spent plodding around trying to gather stuff to fight the not so very tough Guardians. Problem is knowing when to go for the end. Better mechanics but not as fun as Talisman.

Alright, this is what you're waiting to hear- 1) Compared to Talisman, the game is a little less wild- the card density is much lower, there's no roll-and-move, and you have a lot more options in terms of pursuing an actual strategy since you can "develop" your character by purchasing skills.  2) Compared to Runebound, the game is MUCH better overall, there's very little downtime between turns and the game never degenerates into watching someone roll D20s against numbers on a card.  Again, a little less variability but also a little more control.  3) Compared to Return of the Heroes, RotH (which I absolutely adore) is really sort of a hybrid of a pick-up-and-deliver/route planning game with some fantasy trappings.  The character development is much less abstract and the gameplay is slightly more straightforward. 4) Compared to World of Warcraft, the game is actually FUN and has a sense of adventure and narrative rather than just beefing up your character and fighting monsters.  Overall,  I think it's an _excellent_ game if you like this sort of thing and it introduces some very nicely concieved mechanics (particularly the apocalypse ending, moving character abilities to skill cards, and flexible movement) and manages to have a relatively short playtime for the genre, but it still can drag with four or five.  As far as the components go, some people are just crybabies, this is a professionally produced, high-quality game with MUCH better art and graphic design than most Hans Im Gluck games.  The cards are better cardstock than most games published in the 80s (and into the 90s), the artwork is colorful, bright, and even somewhat evocative of the classic Games Workshop-style art.  If you think that the percieved "Olde Worlde Charm" of brown wooden cubes is a barometer of game quality, you probably won't enjoy this anyway.  The game definitely derseves a wider audience and I'd easily rate it one of the best European games of the year so far.

A shorter version of an epic fantasy quest game such as Talisman, Runebound or World of Warcraft.  Often when these Eurofied games try to bill them selves as the shorter version of something else they end up tasting like Lite Beer.  Not Prophecy.  It feels like an epic fantasy quest packed into a neat three-hour package.  Only downsides: board is a little crowded and busy with all the cards out, and at three hours is still a hair longer than it needs to be.  Will definitely get played again.

[i]Prophecy[/i] is an engaging modern revision of the classic adventure game [i]Talisman[/i]. The production quality of the Z-Man Games version is outstanding.
Like most adventure games, [i]Prophecy[/i] is about travelling a fantasy land battling monsters, gathering treasure and improving your character's strengths and abilities. With the myriad of different options and strategies to pursue, it can be easy for the novice to lose sight of the end goal and, just like [i]Talisman[/i], the game can stretch on for longer than it needs to.

The game is really like Talisman without the roll and move and without most of the card draw randomness as you can usually see the cards on the spaces before you move. It's definitely more fun than Talisman.

... however, we found the expansions added significant game length and the new realms were just less fun than what occurs on the main board. The races in the first expansion are take it or leave it, the central island for the 2nd one was interesting, but removed focus from the rest of the board.

So i find the game a 7, but only without the expansions. With them, this is only a 6 or 5.

Definitely one of the best games of its type.  FAR superior to Talisman as they have introduced real decision-making into many aspects of the game coupled with a resource-managament scheme; movement, increasing abilities, etc.  That being said, it is a bit on the long side, and of course you can get screwed either by die rolls or bad cards showing up.  But you have MUCH more control over your fate than in Talisman.  Looking forward to the expansions in English which are said to help speed the game up and fix a few of the card balance issues.

Someone around here told me this game was "an improvement on Talisman" and was to be a "much more modern Magic Realm." 

Pffft. It's none of those things. 

There's absolutely no narrative development and the theme is about as connected to the game as anything Knizia has published. I simply ignored my fellow players throughout as it's perfectly possible to "develop" your character to a point where it can simply cruise straight through all the endgame "conflict" without a hitch. The only strategy required is to ensure you're in the right place to benefit from the encounters each turn--which isn't at all difficult even with the "randomness" some cube-pusher whine about. Ultimately, it's a spreadsheet game with a dragon on the cover. Worst part was having figured out exactly what I needed to do to win at the 20 minute mark and then having to slog through another hour to implement that plan. Played 3 times with long-time gamers and won all 3 handily. 

Spend your money on Talisman (or even Runebound if you're interested in solo play) rather than this bit of dreck.

Having played 1 game is hard to make a good judgment... I liked the game, but was slightly disappointed. I expected more based on other reviews. This game just made Talisman seem more epic, but then again Talisman has so many expansions! I wouldn't want to play Talisman base game only any more, but if I did, I think it would be better than Prophecy on some levels. However, Prophecy has less issues. Our group had less rule problems. It is simpler. But base vs base, there are some things Prophecy does better, character development is probably better in Prophecy, and movement as well.

Prophecy is a simpler twist on Talisman.

Shiny!

Nice maps and bit but not directly user friendly once in use. Manageable but not more.

The game itself have some nice mechanics where wounds means less fighting strength until you heal and so on. I like this part of the game. You have several options each turn and never feel you have nothing to do. There's quite a lot of balancing cards in the game too (perhaps too many?).

What's not to like it the long playing time. Next time I have to try out some of the variants to cut some hours of the playtime. I think the best solution would be for the players to start out a wee bit stronger.

The shuffling of event cards felt a bit tedious after a couple of hours as well. Not that many of them either. Not sure how to solve this?

Update: Sold it as it got no love.

Players take a character and have adventures in a fantasy world.  Build your character, defeat the evil, fantasy adventure game in the style of Talisman.  However, unlike Talisman your fate here is not so dependent on die rolling.  You have genuine movement options and choices here - whether it's developing skills, bashing beasties or working for a turn or two to earn some gold.  The "?" chance deck nicely keeps cards cycling through the game.  The game ends (after at least 3 hours!) when someone has recovered four artifacts from the bad guys.  Attractive game with great ergonomics - the cards are nicely designed (e.g. items are printed "landscape", abilities are "portrait"), and each type uses a different subtle shade.  Crystal clear rulebook too.  It's certainly a cleaner, tighter package than Talisman, but still a long haul for the full game.  Bring on the expansions.

RATING: 7
The English rules are AWFUL - vague, contradictory, ugh.  Spent much of the game discussing what they might mean.

Some nice variations from Talisman, especially diminshing strength as you take damage.  Lasts too long in that things seem very repetitive toward the end (e.g. ran out of new Adventure cards a little over halfway through, after which those cards felt boring.)  Strength-based characters seem to have an advantage as in Talisman.

Not perfect, but scratched that Talisman itch.

Didn't enjoy this one as much as Talisman, but I did like how you had control over movement while movement is a roll of the die in Talisman. It needs expansions as you get tired of seeing the same event and adventure cards over and over again. I also think there should be a card limit per space as people take 10 minutes on there turn as they encounter a deck of 10 cards trying to figure out which order gives them the biggest advantage. Nonetheless, it is still fantasy-themed fun.

I like these fantasy boardgames in general.  How will it stack up against Runebound and Return of the Heroes?  Well, pretty well actually.  It is more simple than either of the other two.  You know exactly what you have to do--build your stats, get some weapons and skills, and go kill bad guys!  It might suffer on replays, but there are three expansions in the works.

Gran juego de aventuras, es más ligero que Runebound y lo hace algo más corto, permitiendo jugar una partida a 4 jugadores en una tarde (Runebound ya con dos jugadores necesitaría más).

Lo peor las reglas, están bien escritas pero deja algunas lagunas, imprescindible leer las FAQs y corregir las cartas con errores. Y un fallo menor, las fichas de los personajes también son un poco... enormes y de cartón, mejor coger un par de minis de otro juego.

Si estás buscando un juego de aventuras para jugar con 4/5 amigos, este es uno de los mejores que puedes encontrar. Y el idioma no es un gran escollo ya que las cartas (lo principal) están acompañadas de iconos que facilitan la comprensión rápida de la carta.

Era imposible sacarlo y al estar en inglés se hacía algo pesado de jugar. Se va en una MT.

I enjoyed this more than other games like Talisman, Runebound, and Return of the Heroes.  While still inevitably chaotic, this felt like it had been mitigated to some degree with a lot of open information for the players.

Also, the game seems to be kind to players, offering up a lot of healing and bonuses without much effort, which I like because it prevents a player that is getting behind to just be languishing in a poor condition or situation.  I felt the game keeps wanting to say "Yes!" to the players, rather than "No!"

My biggest problem with this game is it's length.  Even using the short variant 'gather two artifacts' I felt it was too long for what it was.  I don't mind some long games, but this didn't really appeal to me in the fun vs. length ratio.  Didn't like the die roll + modifier system compared to Arkhams dice & successes model mainly because if you're so geared up you can autowin some combats without rolling dice.  Decent game but I would rather play Arkham Horror.

If you like this type of games (like me) this is actually one of the few Talisman variants which improves on the original. Some elegant mechanics make the game shorter but also similarly colourful if compared to the original. The gameboard looks bland at first glance, but works well, and the cards and abilities are varied enough to keep the fantasy fan happy. Better than "Runebound" in my opinion!

I'm really interested in a fantasy adventure game for playing with my children.  This seems possibly better than [gameid=29294]?  After two plays, some issues I've noticed: 1. down time with 4+ players; 2. lots of cards everywhere, can be overwhelming; 3. there are times where there's nothing to do; 4. I'm not keen on player vs player, and prefer the cooperative variant (which needs tweaking, else the guardians get too powerful - better would be to use the draw deck as a timer, and with less players you get to go through it less); 5. miniatures would be nicer than cardboard standups; 6. It's too long for what it is, and needs an accelerated start (eg start with an item and ability) and accelerated finish (eg end when one player has two artifacts).  Probably a cooperative variant with some tweaking would be excellent.  It is a simpler game than Runebound, and family friendly too, kids might want to replay it over and over, but I'm not sure I would want to.
Arkham Horror (unfortunate name) is another possibility - seems like the best game in this genre, because of the cooperative element (which I prefer to player vs player),

For this long-ago Talisman gamer, Prophecy scratches the itch for "somewhat long boardgame that allows you to build up your character in a race against other players".  There's little interaction, but the fun of planning out your moves and dealing with the vagaries of chance makes it a winner for me.  Not for everyone.

The board is beautiful with quality and durable components.

I have not played the game but I read the rules extensively for  3 hours, did a solo play before teaching it in a store.  

It takes a minimum of 3+ hours.  If a person gets killed they can re-enter as a different character, but after an hour I am not sure there is much point.  That means should you die half way through, you sit and watch the game for the next couple of hours.

The rulebook had some problems--it referred to areas on the board but these areas were unlabeled on the board nor diagrammed in the rulebook.  So we just assumed we knew what was meant.

Extensive text reading slows the game down.  Nothing really new in the mechanics, although I did like the choice of waging war either with mind or the body.  And many different movement choices as well.

I want to like this game I really do, after watching Scott's video review, I found every elements I want from an Table top board game RPG. Especially it;s been out of print for years, and I waited 6 years for the reprint hit the market again 
However, I would not recommend this game and really regret purchasing it for ONE REASON.


PROs:
- BY my favorite designer
- Beautiful, classy, fantasy art
- Awesome game system, map navigation, monster fighting, looting, character building

CON:
- MAJOR TURN DOWN: The map design and card placement is AWFUL. Absolutely awful and takes away all the fun.

Let me elaborate.
The card is way too big to fit in those pathway, I tried to shift it up and down, tilt it but once the map is full of cards, it is really hard to tell what terrain my character is in. And during event phase, I have to flip over many cards to count which tile needs to replenish. Plus it is not easy to lift the card up neither. You might think I am overreacting but when u see a bunch of cards on the board and your character token just constantly fall out of balance because a shit of one card shit every other cards really took away that adventure feel

The map is appealing but the card system on the map just too messy, really took out lot of fun...I mean, I would't mind keeping it, but It probably won hit the table that often given the game needs variant rule otherwise it is way too long

but I really don't want people to dislike this game, it is just a really disappointment for me, and I would blame no one for this, it's really a design issue of the parts. I want to give the credits it is due, I will give at least a 7.5 out of 10. and add 1 point for becoming a reprint and affordable price again. Thank you publisher and the designer

Not too bad an experience, though the art was lacking and the board cluttered. The no-effect flavour text (eg the four-leaf clover that the player keeps for luck) was strangely charming.

Probably better to play an action/RPG on the computer though, as this exhibits all the problems of adventure boardgame: dependence on luck as to whether you have interesting things to do, whether you'll win combats, and whether you can progress; almost no interaction other than fights to the death; and no long-term strategy.

An OK game.  If the dice aren't going your way it can become extremely frustrating, and there aren't a whole lot of ways to mitigate that.  Lasts a bit too long for what it is, even with the shorter ending variant.

Long game, but daughter and I really enjoyed the character progression and sense of adventure.

The Talisman-like mechanics are OK but the game takes very long (our first game was almost 3 hours with just 2 players!). Unfortunately, the components are sub-par (the cards, after torn out, have perforations on the edges, like postage stamps) and the art is positively UGLY compared to what the player expects from western boardgames (at the same time, it's one of best artworks to be found in Czech games). Still, this game was created under different conditions than western games and I can probably recommend it to Czech gamers. Other players are out of luck because the game contains loads of Czech text. There is also an expansion available.

I appreciate someone trying to distill a dungeon crawly adventure-type game, and in many ways this game succeeds. The problem here is that the flavor and theme get lost. It turns into a generic upgrade as fast as you can and still the game just ends with everyone duking it out. This game lacks the theme and flavor that this genre really needs. Prophecy does have some good ideas and the artwork on the cards and characters are nice.

Very much a child of Talisman with some elements changed that make it a better game and some that make it more AP prone. The main changes include a non roll and move travel mechanic, a 'chance' card that is turned up at the beginning of every turn, and guild specific shopping areas. I thought the chance cards were great, they kept the board populated with critters and items and sometimes universally affected players positively or negatively. The travel is different, gone is the move and roll of Talisman. In some ways that is better and in others it takes away a little of the spontaneity. The guild area in the center is mostly a physical and AP mess, IMO. All in all though it is a very enjoyable game and I'm looking forward to the expansions.

The mechanics are similar to other adventure titles, except one has a finer degree of choice and control in how your character develops, and the things you encounter on the board. This makes it a little better for those whom hate dice, or roll and move mechanics. It stands up to the other adventure titles like; Talisman, Return of the Heroes, and Runebound quite well.

The mechanics are simple, but might be a bit confusing for non-gamer's. If you're an adventure game freak, or have a bit of experience with other games of this genre, then it should be a breeze. The Lady, while she's a very experienced adventure board-gamer, had a bit of trouble with the record-keeping. That said, I wouldn't say that it's any more fiddly, difficult or complicated than any other game of it's type. I think it's just the way the information is presented on the cards which makes record-keeping a bit of a chore.

I'd say, like most adventure games, it works good with 4, and best with 2 or 3. While a very good game, for some reason I seem more drawn to Talisman to scratch my adventure game itch, but then again, I rather enjoy luck-fest games.

Liked it, I'm much an eurogamer but I saw this one as an improvement of Talisman. While I doubt to play Talisman, I won't refuse a game of Prophecy
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Prophecy is what happens when Talisman is re-designed as a gamer's game.  Strip the game all the way down to its most basic systems (adventure cards, combat system, strength/willpower) and build it back with the goal of maximizing a player's intelligent choices and minimizing the blind luck.  Prophecy is filled with tough choices: where to move and by what method, which creatures to encounter (most adventure cards are placed face up before you arrive), what skills to learn, how to spend your gold, when to rest and marshall strength, etc.  Nothing else I've played in the "fantasy adventure" genre comes even remotely close to this brilliantly designed game.  Return of the Heroes and Runebound are both horrible compared to Prophecy.

In terms of gameplay and strategy, Prophecy far exceeds Talisman in every imaginable aspect.  However, it does have a couple of shortcomings.  First, Prophecy's art is not as good as Talisman's.  It's better than the gag-inducing Return of the Heroes art, but it's not even in the same league as 2nd edition Talisman.  Secondly, there's just not nearly as much "stuff" here as there is in Talisman.  Talisman's greatest asset was its broad array of enemies and events and items and characters.  Prophecy is not there yet.  But it might get there.  Two expansions that have been published in Czech, and Z-Man games plans to print these in English.

Prophecy plays best with two or three players.  The pace drags a bit with four, and I'd prefer not to play at all with five.  Also, those who like a shorter game might consider requiring just three artifacts for the win and starting the apocalypse countdown (and all the special endgame rules) when the fourth artifact is discovered.

Wow, I really enjoy this game ... certainly it is my favorite of the fantasy boardgame genre. I loved Talisman way back when, but that game worsened with each expansion, and through the lens of contemporary design Talisman is just too long, punitive, and random. Prophecy improves on Talisman in almost every way, while still staying true to the formula (indeed, Talisman players may safely consider this a Talisman remix). But the game has been made less arbitrary and punishing, and there is a more sensible difficulty curve. The endgame is improved by a direct if still-dicey throwdown between the players. Yes, it still has aspects of mutual solitaire, and luck counts for a lot, but as an example of it's genre I think it is top rate. It is like I got Talisman back after all these years, which is quite a gift. I will try to manfully resist adding expansions to an already-enjoyable game that clocks in at about one hour per player. Nice components in my Z-Man edition.

Its Talisman ancestry is hard to miss. Very pretty game, and the movement system is a nice touch, but I don't know if there's enough here to make me want to play this over Talisman. I'm not a fan of the small sized cards either, they should have been printed full sized for sleeving (IMO).

The general consensus is true: It's a better version of Talisman. Now, I absolutely hate Talisman, so what does that mean to me? Well, I actually had fun with this one.

I agree with the criticisms that it takes too long and is too repetitive. However, I think both of those things can be managed and minimized. Before starting, we all agreed on modifications that would speed up the game. We played with five, which I knew going in was going to be a problem. However, once everyone understood what to do, it moved at a pretty good pace. I know for certain that our next game will go much faster.

As for the repetition, I think that's to be expected with any game of this type, at least to a degree. It really didn't bother me, but I could see how it might bother others.

Overall, it was a fun gaming experience, and I look forward to giving it another try (probably with 3 or 4 players).

I've only had a chance to play the basic game.   I can see where there may be a game in there.  I'd rate the basic game somewhere between a 5 and a 6.  The collection of cards to win just seems to blah.  But, I'm not putting it in as the rating as it seems the basic rules were just thrown in and I do not feel it's indicative of how the game will play the way it appears to be meant to play.

Very good dungeon crawl/ D&D-lite game out.  You have several choices per turn for the movement, most of the characters seem pretty balanced.  Some of the late game artifacts seem really strong and the incentive to beat on the other players the continue to kick them while they are down isn't the best thing.  At the same time, this game doesn't feel like it has nearly the story that others of the genre provide, mostly because the encounters seem so random.  You fight a vampire in the plains!  Hey its my turn, a pirate appears in the mountains!  ad nauseum.

What a disappointment this game was.  Like an extremely dumbed down form of the WoW board game that has a totally meaningless combat system and takes far too long to get your character powered up.  I especially loathe the XP system and skills - not only do you have an XP limit but then there are limited skills to buy at any given time so you're stuck either wasting XP or buying useless crap.  The items aren't much better - even expensive rare items didn't seem very helpful.

We didn't bother finishing our play as we were all pretty bored and irritated with the game.  The WoW board game blows this away in all aspects except for the game length.  It feels like there are no real decisions to be made in this game other than 'go to x space, deal with y card, roll two dice to decide my fate and hope for the best'.

This is a beautifully crafted game from Z-Man. Play is fast with very little downtime. Combat is too simplistic for my tastes, but it keeps the game going. It effectively captures the feel of some older RPGs, albeit with plenty of abstraction. However, another player commented that this reminded her of Arkham Horror, and she's not too keen on it. Maybe we'll get this back to the table soon. Although we played for three hours to only two artifacts, I think we spent too much time pumping up our characters. Seems we should be attacking the Astral Planes within an hour or two. We just didn't know how powerful we needed to be. With additional plays, this will become apparent. Also seems that replay value will suffer as we get to know the encounter cards. Is this better than Talisman? I don't know, it's been awhile since I've played that other one, but it is fun to play this type of game again.

Update (08/27/11): It's been several years since this has seen the table, but it was fun breaking this out again for several newbies wanting to see what this game was about. It took four hours to play to two artifacts with five players. Some of the rules regarding encounters is confusing, but other than that, it is a straightforward game. I was surprised to discover that the designer is Vladimir Chvatil, who also designed Through the Ages and Dungeon Lords, both designs I dislike. Prophecy is quite unlike those games. Not bad breaking this out once in awhile, but not too frequently either.

Preliminary rating based on one (incorrect) play.  I like the general feel of this fantasy world, as well as the breadth of choice on your turn; however—and this was agreed to by all present—the game was fussy and cramped compared to [i]Talisman[/i].  Several players wished out loud that we were playing [i]Talisman[/i] instead, as it seems to move more quickly and can support more players with less downtime.  Will update after playing correctly.

UPDATE:  Anyone who thinks this is better than [i]Talisman[/i] is full of hot air and lard.  [i]Talisman[/i] is the best game possible.  [url=https://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/1862415/talismangler-ii-retalismangling]QED[/url]

Rating based on a partial play, due to time constraints.

This is a great game.  Did not get to the end game, but, the main game is terrific.  VERY much like Talisman in a lot of ways, but without being a clone.  Also has elements of Return of the Heroes in it.  The movement mechanic is excellent as you are forced to make decisions on what course of action you choose to take.  Fight the nasty monster one region away in order to get closer to the handy item 2 regions away?  Spend the gold to buy a ride past the nasty to go straight to the item, but have no gold for training?  Catch a ship to a distant port?  Stay where you are and take a training action?  The characters are pretty much all of your fantasy RPG archetypes, and that is fine as there are a lot to choose from.  The idea that you can train for free to learn skills for your own class (i.e.; train for free at the fortress and monastery if you are a paladin), but pay equal amounts of experience AND gold to train outside your class (at the thieves' camp, for example) is a great balancing factor and really captures the feel of multi-classing in Dungeons & Dragons.  I can't wait to play a full game soon, and definitely cannot wait until I can find my own set

A very fun adventure game.  It seems to play well with 2, 5, and any number in between.  I like that you can get a skill from any guild if you want.  I tend to stick with my main 2 guilds, but it lets me pick up a random skill or two as interesting ones pop up.

Great concept, especially the interdependence of strength and health, but it's like a "nice, fair" Talisman. Despite more sophisticated rules than Talisman, it's not mean enough to make the competition fun. Talisman has more extreme highs and lows, whereas I think this one hovers too safely in the middle.

This is the longest game I've managed to try out so far.  We really enjoyed this one.  I've never personally played any roleplaying D&D stuff, but I read a review on here that said this game has that kind of feel.  My boyfriend seemed to feel that way.  I just liked all the fighting and foes. Yay!

As a casual RPG adventure game, Prophecy gives back player the control of the character’s movement; yet allows the randomness in an adventure game. 

Prophecy is like Talisman with an improved game engine, which I enjoy better.

The game supports up to 5 player, but that will be too long for me.

Neat little board role-playing game. Characters go around the board fighting monsters to gain gold and experience. Gold and experience can be used to buy abilities or items for your character.

Kill monsters, collect toys, kill more monsters, get more toys.  After 1 play, I think I really like this.  I played it with two.  Both of us are long-time D&D players and already enjoy other dungeon crawl games like Descent.  We played the race to two artifacts variant, and didn't engage in any PvP.  We both agreed that it would be great with 3 players, and especially if no players who suffer from AP are invited.

Things that I like so far:
* Turns are fast, low downtime.
* Movement gets easier as the game progresses, and you never really have to slog through parts of the board that you don't care about.
* I like games where my character grows and gets toys.  Perfect fit here.
* Character classes only define what is easiest for you to train in.  You can still train in anything you want for a higher price.

Initial Rating: 5.0  (December 2012)

I love most games from designer Vlaada Chvátil, perhaps he is the best game designer in the world. I love Through the Ages, Dungeon Lords and Space Alert. Due to this, I was very keen on trying Prophecy but it was a painful letdown for me. Perhaps I expected way too much, but it is a very simple (and boring?) game. We played only the basic edition and perhaps (hopefully!) there were rules mistakes.

It is certainly better than Talisman, but that’s not high praise. I remember I thought the game has lots of luck and the game is way too long for what it offers.

As I have a lot of faith on Vlaada, I bought the game and I expect to play it again soon. When  I do, I will come back to do a proper comment.

I finally played Prophecy with all the rules, I had some fun playing it but I don’t want to play it again.

Prophecy is a Talisman like game, but better. It has more meaningful choices but luck still plays an prominent role. Playtime is over the 4 hour mark. Way too much for this kind of game, it gets very repetitive soon! The downtime is excessive, so the game is best with 3 players. I cannot imagine playing with 5!

I have the Zman edition and the bases are too tight for the heroes. The player´s boards are unnecessary big.

I read two different set of rules, they changed how the end develop. I much prefer the final fight because it plays a lot faster!

Bottom line, Prophecy is the worst game I have played from my favorite game designer (Vlaada Chvátil). I gave it two chances to woe me, but this kind of game is not for me. The long playtime and downtime kill the game for me. I’m selling it ASAP. It is a better game than Talisman in every regard but the components.

Played once, with 2 players.  Certainly better than Talisman, by leaps and bounds.  For me, a little too repetitive and stagnant near the end, and I thought it went on a bit too long.  Runebound (with 2, fast rules) goes on a bit too long, as well, but I didn't feel the stagnation there as much as I did here.  I'd play it again, but don't feel the need to run out and buy it.

RATING: 7
Prophecy is different from most adventure games. While a lot of adventure games are epic in scope, a bit bloated with endless cards, and can have very long play times, Chavtil re-designed some of the the basic principles to align with more streamlined eurogame mechanics. Gone are the quests. Gone is the vast landscape to explore. Gone (for the most part) is the sense of discovery. The game board is a circular collection of regions and locations that players can either slowly walk around on foot or pay money to use horses, ships and magic gates to get around quickly. For as small as the board is, improving your travel options through items or abilities is a MAJOR part of this game. Characters have two main abilities - Strength/Health and Willpower/Magic. Battles can be fought physically or magically. Magical combat is abstracted so that you don't cast specific spells, you simply match up Willpower/Magic traits. There are spells in the game, but they are cast prior to combat. Tying these traits together so that if you get hurt your fighting weakens is one of the great innovations of the game, I think. Each region can have two possible encounters, at least one of which is always face up so that it is hard to get completely surprised. Chavtil also did away with leveling. When you gain experience by killing creatures, you can trade it in at training centers in order to gain the ability cards currently on offer. The disappointing aspect of this is that aside form the artifact guardians, encounters do not get more difficult as the characters get better, they only get easier. Combat is a single comparative die roll with modifiers, as opposed to most other adventure games which either use handfuls of dice or many small dice rolls. The objective is to gain 4 out of 5 artifacts that are guarded by powerful creatures. Usually, a character cannot gain all four on his own, so once all artifacts have been claimed the characters must fight each other to get up to 4. This is one of my major disappointments with the game. After ridding the world of monsters for the entire game, the big baddie at the end is...another hero?? It just doesn't make sense to me that these heroes would be fighting each other and I find it anticlimactic.

Overall, I think the game is good, but it doesn't capture my imagination quite like an adventure game should. If fans of efficient eurogames want to try an adventure game, this would be a good start for them.

Very disappointing - no desire to play again.  In no way does this game address the key problem in non-co-op adventure games:  player interaction.  No amount of novel ideas and board design etc will save this kind of game if it does not handle that issue.  Talisman is better than this simply because it is not trying to be clever.

Just one play, but I REALLY enjoyed it. Lots of decisions to be made. It runs long (3-4 hours for our 4 player game), but with card familiarity it should speed up some. I disliked my one play of Return of the Heroes, but this gave choices. Glorious choices.

I like the coop variant of this as well but I have cooled a bit on it.

I'm not big into roleplaying, RPG-based boardgames or the genre of experience games as a whole. But Prophecy is fun enough to fill that very small niche in my collection to satisfy the rare need of playing an RPG-based boardgame. It's still a bit on the long side but decisions are meaningful enough and preparation against bad luck is possible to make the time spent worthwile. Not like Talisman, Zombie State or other experience games of similar length.

Finally, finally, finally I get to play this one, after owning (at least briefly) three different copies from two different publishers. And ... it's pretty good. Definitely I prefer it to Runebound, which I already owned and traded away, in that Prophecy is less random in movement, far less combat oriented (generally, one quick round in Prophecy versus round after round of Hero and Allies battling), and overall quicker playing.

The end game *can* seem anticlimactic, especially in the "short" version, because when you haven't played before, it's hard to know when you're strong enough to go after the guardians. If you play it conservative (a natural tendency in a first game), it's going to take longer and feel flatter because the baddies aren't as bad as you are. All of these games should be treated as "race" games, where you get to the goal in as few moves as possible.

Overall, good components, a very nice upgrade from the Altar Games version. The small Chance deck actually plays out OK, even though I'd imagine it getting a bit too predictable. The Adventure Cards are where this game probably comes up the shortest vis-a-vis a game like Runebound. The encounters in Prophecy, both combat and noncombat, feel pretty generic--lion, vampire, snake, etc. The mountains of cards are the one thing I'll miss about Runebound.

I definitely see playing this again. Probably best with three, as the rulebook suggests. I'd like to get a final-battle version in, too.

Very good adventure game.
What I want to add to other comments is this : not only should you try it if you like Runebound and Return and the like, but you should also try it if you DON'T like those but like the theme. Because this game is a very clever resource management game at heart, with panache ! Rules and gameplay are elegant. Prophecy is more strategical and tactical that other games in the "adventure" league, and yet highly narrative. Your character never wanders about, you always have a plan.

"As an ex-fan of RPGs, I really thought this Talisman-like game would do the trick. Streamlined mechanisms, various non-dicebased movement types, unorthodox map... what could go wrong? It turned out the game was more of a chore-filled yawnfest than anything else, with characters that all feel the same, piles of small cards obscuring the map and tons of small text you have to constantly re-read to figure out how to resolve what was supposed to be a supremely simple combat system. Whenever I pulled out this game, it never failed to.. well, fail."

RATING: 6
Stream lined traditional adventure game. The very small 'chance' deck means you see a lot of the cards many times which could lead to slow decline in interest after multiple plays. However, the element of strength and magic being linked to your health and the fact that movement is sort of demoted in importance making for easier and much more purposeful movement makes this a fun and slick alternative to fantasy adventure gaming. A dice lover's dream, a strategy lover's nightmare.  
UPDATE: After multiple plays I'm starting to feel "cramped" by the Prophecy world. In multi-player games the spaces get stacked to the gills with overflowing pointlessness and the overall lack of spaces as a whole just makes me feel claustrophobic. I think I'd rather go back to RotH or Talisman not because of mechanics or theme or feel... just so I have a bigger land to explore. The good thing Prophecy still has going for it is the variable skills that allow you to create character combos, but other than that I'm slowly growing bored of it.

Interested in this because of comments I saw a long time ago from puck4604 or helenoftroy, but I forget where.  Glad to see it's Z-Man doing the reprint.

Update: bought this [i]from Zev![/i] at BGG.CON.  Looking forward to trying it with the burrito boy, and am hoping I like it more than Talisman (which he likes).

Update: after one 4-player game, the burrito boy [i]says[/i] he prefers Talisman, but as his parent and legal guardian, I believe it is my responsibility to make him play this instead; it's [i]soooo[/i] much better.  After playing this, it is unlikely that I would ever play Talisman with adults.  The deal-breaker with the burrito boy, though, will be to see how it plays 2-player (we haven't done that yet).

Update: we've played this 2-player a few times now, and now he asks for this instead of Talisman!  Yay!

Prophecy (originally released as Proroctví) is a Talisman-style game by Czech designer Vladimír Chvátil. The players represent fantasy characters on a path through a land full of adventure with the goal of grabbing ancient artifacts from the claws of demons guarding the surrounding astral realms.

Instead of rolling dice to move around the game board, players in Prophecy use a variety of means of transport. The game includes an experience system and loads of skills and spells that your character can learn. A large number of monsters that you can meet and fight also await you, as do random events that will keep taxing your abilities because after you cast a spell or lose a fight, your strength or willpower declines until it is recharged by healing.

One of the better "close to the theme" adventuring/dungeon crawling type of games.  With a nice euro type resource management and solid mechanics, it's decent fun.  I'd generally rather play a "real" board game involving more management and planing than controlling a little character killing monsters and gathering loot, but still, this works well and some people want that type of gameplay and it doesn't take 5+ hours.

RATING: 2
It's so long and boring for a very random game. It took up 3 hours to play the short game with 5 players. I wonder how much time the regular game takes.

If you like talisman, you might like this game. They are very similar. I think this game is a bit better than Talisman if you are hesitating between both game.

Else, stay way from it.

It takes so much time to power up your character since each powerup gives so little bonus. Movement is so slow, if you are wounded or lack of gold, it's just faster to wait for the random events to give you those resource than spend 10 turns to reach the city that is going to give you those resources.

At the beginning of the game it took more than a complete turn before stuff could appear on the board. So we ended up having nothing to do at the start of the game. No encounters, no challenge and no items to buy.

The board is also fiddly, at least in talisman, you had space to place your cards on the board directly, here all the cards are chaotically placed around the track of the board making it confusing. It also increases the amount of reading around the board players needs to do.

The game is also very random, you roll 1 die in battle and that's it. Sometimes you can chose to use strength or willpower to fight, but that is about the only decision you have to make in battles.

This is Talisman but it is called Prophecy.  (wink, wink)  It actually is a bit better than Talisman but is very similar kind of game.  And, just like Talisman, it has a "falling-behind issue" b/c if you fall way behind in the game, it is not likely you will be able to catch up to contend for a win.  I wouldn't want to play this with five players and barely interested with four.   With three, it's not overly long so it would suit me for what it is.

I'm glad I got a chance to play because I've been curious about this genre of games for a little while.  That being said, the downtime and largely solitaire play with an anti-climatic ending was a bit of a let down although it was interesting to see my character develop and acquire items (limited in quantity that it did occur).  Very repetitive play made it feel too long as well for me even though our four person game really didn't take all that long.  Basically, I came, I saw, I played, and now I never feel the need or the urge to pursue further gameage in this genre...:-)

Nice simple Dungeon Crawl. Character are a bit bland since they only have 2 stats. But the different guilds give you stuff to personalize your character.

It is really key to pay attention to adventure card that gives permanent increase. If only one player gets them all he is sure to win.

This is among the best RPG-esque boardgames.  It's playable in an afternoon or evening.  Lots of interesting things to explore and control over your movement are great aspects of the game.  The short game seems to be the only way to play this--I think it would drag on too long if you play the full version without a sufficient payoff in fun.  I definitely want to play this more and check out the expansions when they are available.  

Update:  this has held up well after repeated plays.  Dragon Realm adds some nice variety with extra cards and races, but I'm not sure about the rest.  Still waiting for Water Realm...

RATING: 6.1
An adventure style game along the lines of Talisman but with a bit more player interaction involved in the endgame.  This game cries for expansions though since the adventure deck is a little thin and gets recycled a lot. Character building is where this game shines in comparison to its kin though since you are able to build your character through purchasable skills but you have to get them before your opponents do!

RATING: 6.5
Picked up Sept 2006

Tried one solo game with 2 characters working co-operatively. It seems to be reasonably playable as a solo game. I like it in that the game is simple to understand and easy to set up, so getting into a game is less of a hassle, compared to say Arkham Horror. There is also more control in your movement so you actually feel like you are working towards the development of your character when the right opportunities present themselves within reach, unlike in Talisman. The board gets a bit cluttered with all the cards and the tiny glass stones are quite fiddly (much prefer using normal sized stones, which I had to use since my copy seemed to have an incomplete set of original stones), but these are really minor complaints. Overall, I am very glad I went through the trouble (and expense!) of hunting down this game. It is exactly the light fantasy adventure boadgame I've been looking for. I am already eager for the English expansions.

I think the game is too long for what it yields, the first phases play like a multiplayer solitaire - interaction starts at the end of the game when players have a reason to play against each other.

Ahhh.... Talisman revised, just right!  

For those who bemoan a lack of interaction in Prophecy; they must not have made it to the end-game.  The final stage of this game  = "hunt down the other players and take their Artifacts".  Interaction is also heavy in the early game, although of a different sort.  Because movement is not random, careful consideration must be given to where your opponents are and where they are going.  

Lots of changes to gameplay from Talisman - at first glance it may seem similar, but wait until you start playing.  Different movement, different character building, different system for generating encounters. 

If the expansions don't come out in English, I'll try to learn Czech.

I may be looking for the Z-Man edition, if the expansions (if they ever come out) are not compatable with the Alter edition.

This is "adventure game mixed with euro". You always decide which encounter You want to meet so You can calculate the risk and resources (time being one of them) which You would use to do it. Most efficient hero would win. All that said, the game is very fantasy themed, with a lot of flavor, intersting heroes and top components. For me it has little to none similarities with Talisman which is dicefeast. Prophecy is very good game, mixing adventure and strategy.
The only minus is to long playing time, but only because i have not as many time for gaming as i would like. Playing Prophecy i am interested and involved all the time, only nearby clock tells that the game takes that long.

Yet another fantasy adventure game. Yet another instance of a game fixing some problems inherent to the genre perfectly while simultaneously adding some new ones and ignoring old ones better addressed elsewhere. I guess there is something about fantasy adventure games that make it impossible to really nail it perfectly. But despite it's flaws I think it is both a solid representation of the general idea as well as a game that brings it's own little innovations to the table enough to make it worth playing sometimes. For me it wouldn't be redundant to have 10 different fantasy adventure games if they all hit different high (and low) notes, so it's easy for me to think highly of this. If one wasn't so enamored of the genre though, you'd probably find that this doesn't bring enough new to the mix for it to get picked up.

If you loved Talisman, run, do not walk, to the nearest store where you can acquire this game. Its better. Its faster. I'm not sure that its completely beat out Return of Heroes or Runebound for me, but it is certainly more accessible in terms of rules, setup and play time than either of those offerings. So may actually be a better introduction to the 'adventure' type fantasy game than those options.

7 hours (over the course of two days)! 2 Players. Mostly ugly artwork, crowded gameboard, lots of looking-up in the rulebook (almost no holes in the rules, but could be a bit better organized).

Well balanced fantasy adventure. The characters are barely predefined, you can customize them to your liking as the game progresses. The winning condition provides a relatively fast play as it forces competitive race if you don't want a runaway leader, or if you've got one, it's even faster. The adventure cards can be too repetitive after awhile, this game just begs for expansions. Best played with 2-4, and kids from 6 love it, however younger ones could play it too with a slight help.

Had a very fun play of this game: my Druid came from far behind and mastered the Universe, collecting 4 artifacts to my opponent's combined ZERO.  Har har har!  However, we exhausted the encounter deck, and given the charaters are really not so different, there is not a compelling reason to play again, as all the surprises are pretty much gone.  A fun ride for this game, however.  Pretty nice art, except the mapbaord, but the magic items could have been a bit more colorful.  One of the best rules ever: the curse of the mummy.  While the curse is given no effect in game turns, it says that you will be aware of this curse through your continued bad rolls and card draws during play of the game.  At least I had something to blame for being beaten by the swordswomam like five times!

Pros:
Some really neat ideas, a really good RPG-lite system
Definite opportunities for RPGing (ex: 4-Leaf clove)
I really like the way heroes "upgrade" their skills
There are some actual, interesting decisions to be made
Neat catch-up mechanics
Characters felt fairly balanced
Cons:
The game can take forever, especially if playing it as delivered with a PvP finale 
This is doubly damning as under these rules, players get eliminated. Hello, Risk!
Despite the catch-up mechanics, a streak of good/bad luck can make the game, especially in the first quarter of the game. I think this is inherent to this type of game where the first player to level up ahead of his competitors has the major advantage of being able to kill the bigger monsters -- and thus get even more xp, get even more levels, and kill even more monsters
Would have liked a bit more variety in the characters, maybe if they all started with a special ability?
Not enough variety in the event cards, after 2-3 games this can get repetitive.
Overall, a great game that could have used just a bit more development time/polishing.

I have played both versions of Prophecy.  The new edition has made a great game even better.  Very smooth playing.  Balanced.  Easy to learn and now even better looking.  I should mention I play "first person to get two artifacts" wins - otherwise it runs a bit long (especially w/more than 3).  Still, it's one of the best of this type of fantasy game, The 'movement management' just really does it for me.  Good stuff.  Can't wait to play the long awaited expansions.  Often compared to Talisman, but I find this game far superior to my taste.  I also like it better than the vaguely similar Return of the Heroes, Runebound, and Talengarde.

I think this is my favorite adventure game, but there really aren't any good adventure games.

In order to make the game not last an eternity we play with some house rules.  You start with 10 gold and 10 xp, and are dealt 3 basic item cards and 3 skill cards from your primary.  You can buy from those cards and then discard the rest.  All the locations are populated with cards (all terrains, the village and city, and two cards at each training place).  We show the astral monsters right away because they'll be half uncovered by that one chance card and getting randomly screwed on which boss is a waste of time.  We don't allow attacking other players and take out the one thief skill and a few items that destroy other player's stuff.  The goal of the game is to get 2 artifacts.

The game is basically a race to improve your combat high enough to take out the ~8 strength boss monsters.  You start with ~4 so you just need 4 to 6 upgrades of combat ability.

I can admit it, when Prophecy first came into our scene I thought it was great. Hey, look, it's Talisman but there are choices to make... and it doesn't suck!

Sigh. I've heard people say it's take a strong man to recognize their mistake. Well, this was one of them. Boring and long. The decisions? Hell, they aren't at all interesting and, it's just Talisman, who really needs them?

One of the worst games on my list, designed by the same man as one of the best games on my list. Aren't games an interesting medium?

A wonderful yet underrated game. Prophecy is a must own for anyone who likes Talisman, Return of the Heroes, or Runebound.  Prophecy's gameplay is most similar to Talisman, but it's less chaotic and random.  Movement and character development is more purposeful (than Talisman) which allows for some planning on the player's part.  The game is very attracive on the table, but even still, the artwork is not up to par with it's competition. I'm looking forward to seeing it's expansions released in English.

After some initial confusion about how different cards come into play, Prophecy clicked in a big way with me and my wife - by the tenth round or so. All in all, the short (first to two artefacts) version took us close to five hours to finish (with periodic breaks to deal with family matters), and we're in no way slow players. So be prepared for a long first experience! The game will probably move quicker once we learn to advance our characters more effectively, but no way will Prophecy ever be played on weeknights.
But despite the long playing time, the game was thrilling from start to finish. There's an epic, almost RPG-ish feeling in the process of upgrading your character to deal with tougher and tougher challenges... and that's not too bad... in just five hours.

Enjoyed the game, but the time element of it is a real factor.  Gameplay can become a bit tedious hunting for FIVE artifacts.  Another gamer suggested that play would be enhanced if we only played with two artifacts and this did help gameplay considerably, otherwise rating would be lower (probably a 4 or a 5 with all artifacts in play).  Very similar to Return of the Heroes, but a little more meat on the bone to be had.

Some may prefer this to Talisman, but to me, Talisman is a game to just throw some dice around, play from the hip and take ones lumps. Prophecy sets out to improve the strategy end and decrease the luck factor, but just balloons the experience with downtime. The board is also a cluttered mess after a few turns.

This was not Vlaada at his most innovative. After Galaxy Trucker, I would really like to see what he could do to improve on the fantasy model that is new and different.

I enjoyed this game.  It is a different take on Talisman where the designer tried to fix the ways you move around the board and build your character.  You never find yourself NOT being able to get where you want to go within a turn or two.

It's probably the best that I've played of the category of "wander around and beat things up to get experience and gold to allow you to get stronger and faster to eventually beat the stronger, faster, baddest things to win the game". Turns are fast and you've usually got some decent choices, which are two big steps up on the usual junk in the category. But you're still mostly playing it for the ride rather than the challenge. Nonetheless, I was engaged throughout and that's a plus.

RATING: 7
"Light adventure game, which I would only ever play as a co-op. It has some neat systems, and unlike many Vlaada game, is not pointlessly complex. It does seem to run long, so some kind of quick start is probably necessary. The character development is pretty cool for such a light game."

What I like:
- Thematic adventure co-op (I won't play it competitively)
- Light but not overly random
- Leveling up of characters is quite well done
- Good variety of items and abilities
- Special abilities of monsters are simple but effective

What I don't like:
- Insanely slow start. Needs a turbo-quickstart variant. 
- Trading in co-op shouldn't require giving up movement

There are official co-op rules in the Dragon Realm expansion. There is also an unofficial co-op variant on BGG, which some seem to think is better.

At least as a co-op, the start of the game is painful. You spend turn after turn slowly moving around trying to get to the occasional monster you stand a chance of beating. Then you limp off to slowly heal back up. The quickstart in the book is nowhere near quick enough. Starting with 8 gold/8 XP isn't nearly quick enough. Next time we'll try starting with more gold, xp, a movement ability, and probably a couple extra cubes. If there is a next time. 

I would put the weight around 2.4, a bit lower than BGG voters.

 This game could be one of the most succesful fantasy boardgames. But it is not. It has more strategic choises than Talisman but I don`t think they improve the gameplay.
 1. Game is way to long. Building of your hero takes to much time
 2. There is to much card floping. They make the board cluttered
 3. Downtime is very annoying. Besides, attacking other characters is rather pointless so everyone plays for him/herself.
 I still prefer Talisman over those modern fantasy boardgames which produce downtime and illusion of strategy.

Premetto che non mi fanno impazzire i giochi "powerplay" dove si accumulano oggetti, incantesimi e bonus per fare le combo, e nonostante l'esistenza di giusti limiti monetari, di esperienza e di caratteristiche, il gioco risente di un certo "eumatismo" (vedi World of Warcraft - the boardgame).
Eccettuato il tabellone, brutto e troppo astratto, il resto dei componenti è graficamente eccellente (peccato per i personaggi, che a parte il nome e il disegno differiscono tra loro solo dal valore delle due statistiche: alla fine del gioco uno stregone con spada a due mani può attaccare un mercenario che lancia palle di fuoco). La meccanica dei combattimenti (tiro di dado più modificatori dati da skill/oggetti/incantesimi) è veloce e snella senza risultare piatta, così come il sistema che aggiorna eventi e incontri. La quantità impressionante di oggetti, incantesimi, mostri ed eventi dà la sensazione di grande longevità.
Inoltre, benché l'interazione sia garantita dagli eventi comuni, la scarsa convenienza/probabilità di attaccare un altro giocatore fanno di Prophecy un quasi-solitario di gruppo, battaglia finale esclusa ovviamente.
E poi un non-difetto, ma un avvertimento. Forse a causa della lunghezza nello scegliere cosa fare prima di combattere, Prophecy dura un sacco di tempo.
Concludendo, sebbene non originalissimo, Prophecy è un gioco divertente e abbastanza facile da poter giocare con tutti.

Preliminary rating after one play. Fun adventure game. Fight monsters to gain experience, use experience to improve your abilities so you can fight tougher monsters and so on, until de final monster is defeated. The movement and guild systems work well tough and give the player some interesting decisions along the way. A little bit on the longuish side but it didn't feel boring. Must play again to see bow it goes... rating may go up or down.

We played this game at the local boardgames/rpg convention. Some rules were misunderstood because we learned the game there by trying. But in the end it was some fun. I'm usually a fan of fantasy adventures and this one is a bit worse than some others available but still a solid 8.
I'd sure like to play this one again sometime! (It's just damn hard to find..)

RATING: 5
Plodding pace and subpar graphical organization makes this a rather boring experience. Feels like nothing happened for the two first hours. The simple circular travel route on the board feels unengaging (there are all kinds of shortcuts and alternative routes, I know, but it still feels bland).

RATING: 9
A great fantasy adventure that fits into a few hours, plays well with two, and has a great power/level-up/skill system.  Unfortunately, with only 2 players, the PvP aspect seems to be pretty useless.  For 2 players it seems to make a better "race to the top" game, whoever gets the most artifacts wins.

RATING: 8
One of the best adventure type game. You can level your character with various skills, making each game have a different feel. The map is a simple circle around the outside, so it doesn't have quite as nice a feel as say Runebound or Magic Realm of exploring around the map. But this does make the game flow faster. There is not much player interaction, although the final battle does involve a death match.

RATING: 4.5
Vlaada Chvátil and Dirk Henn have at least one thing in common.  Their idea of a good game is not the same as mine.  If some new hyped game is coming down the pipe with either of these two distinguished designers attached to it I know there's no reason for me to get interested.

Oh, by the way, I played Prophecy recently.  Admittedly it was only the basic game, but it didn't change my opinion of good ol' Vlaada's game designs.  It does crib much from Talisman so it's not a completely uninteresting experience.

Changes from Talisman: 
Prophecy has fewer spaces on the board.  It gives the players perfect control about where they want to move.  It causes cards to be revealed during an event phase at the beginning of the turn so players are never surprised by what they encounter.  And so it sells its soul to the dark lord of Eurogames.

Compared to Talisman there is no drama or surprise.  In the basic game players need at least 15 experience to win the game.  Experience comes from killing monsters.  So in the beginning players stumble around a bit trying to build up their stats.  But once the characters reach a certain level it's just a race to fight what monsters are available.  The game reaches a point where players pointlessly wander around the board waiting for the next "draw cards" event to see what new monsters will become up.

In an even more frustrating turn of events the designer has seen fit to make money, health and magic rain on the characters via the event deck.  Where's the thrill in killing a Vampire for 7 gold when the next event card dumps gold on all the players?  How is it a difficult choice to use up all your magic when the next event card will replenish your mana?  If you wander around with one life point, you are not walking a razor's edge between life and death because before your turn comes around someone's going to pick the "everybody finds a free medikit" card.

Vlaada has included an interesting mechanism regarding the control of magic and health points.  For example, players have a fixed number of health cubes.  As they take damage they move the cubes from one side of their player mat to the other.  A players current health is equal to their strength in battle.  Throughout the game players will want to keep their cubes on the health side of their mat (not too hard considering the contents of the event card deck).  But their strength is limited the total number of cubes they have.  So acquiring new cubes is very valuable and usually requires players to spend valuable experience points.  The choice of whether to spend experience points on stats or on the game winning conditions is the most interesting part of the game.

In Prophecy we have a poorly Euroized Talisman.  It trades randomness and surprise for straight forward procedures.  The art isn't as good and don't get me started on the poorly laid out board with its square miles of wasted space.  I have some hopes for the advanced game but so far I see no reason to play this when the glorious FFG version of Talisman is on the market.

Probably the best recreation of Talisman yet. But made our group realize that Talisman was fun because we were 15 years old at the time.  Nowadays we like things with a bit more thinking/strategy.  In Prophecy your entire decision making process is based around the luck of a card draw and dice rolls for combat.  It's possible for someone to get extremely unlucky and never get anywhere.  Younger crowd would like it.  Great production values.

PROS

Beautiful game board, fabulous artwork on the cards.

CONS

Cards and text very small, the board gets to be a mess with so many cards everywhere - it's a bit fiddly, and it's a little difficult to learn (lots of details but not really hard once you get it.) 

Takes way too long to play - this is my main complaint. it's too long for what it is.  There are times when you feel like the choices you have aren't very meaningful or helpful. Not a bad game if you don't mind game length and if you like this style of game. I rated it one point higher because I think it's a good game for some, just not for us.

RATING: 7
Remarkably bland dry adventure boardgame with good movement and character-building mechanics (plus terrible art). We usually have had enough (so stop playing) by the time one of the players defeats a lesser guardian. How anyone could say this is an RPG game is beyond me -- I suppose it is by Eurogame standards. Much prefer Return of the Heroes.

*** 

Prophecy isn't a Eurogame, but I enjoyed how he subtly added some Eurogame decision features into a "roll and move" genre. Unfortunately, I thought the first expansion added too much fiddliness (and have it up for trade in the SF Bay Area). I highly recommend the BGG variant "kits" to speed up the beginning game.

One of the best fantasy boardgames.  Players are aventurers trying to reach fame and fortune in a Magical Realm.  They travel, perfom quests, fight beings, get healed and deal to become stronger so they can asume the battle against the Portal Keepers and steal treasures from them.  The first player to get two of such treasures wins the basic game, which is the one that I like the most.

RATING: 5
With 5 players the game is too slow, and if you take action again and you have a bad dice rolling, you need to wait again. you cannot take anything else for many minutes, just rolls the dice and wait. The main game system is very good, but the dice rolling in the war is too simple and randomly.

RATING: 7.2
This game rating is for playing with kids (I have played with kids in in the 7-10 range).  A great adventurous journey.  Probably not likely a game I would want to pull out for the adult game group.  Prophecy is about the most scalable of the adventure games I have played (Talisman and Runebound being the others).  You can scale the game to play in an hour or so and have it still feel like a full and satisfying experience.  The combat system is nice and streamlined, with results normally coming down to one roll of dice.    
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I highly recommend this game to anyone that likes Talisman or Runebound but wants a quicker experience.  There's less player interaction then Talisman but it has a much better move system and encounter system.  You have encounters appear on the map based on Chance cards, not landing on a square.  There's alot more strategy in deciding where to go since the random factor of moving has been removed.  After playing this game just once I have finally found the game that satisfies that "Talisman itch" I've had for years.  I could never get anyone interested in playing Talisman since it takes forever and has balance issues.  This game should be easy to get a group together for.

Good lightweight fantasy adventure game. Lots of decisions to make and a nice fun factor. I really like the fact that half the adventure cards are events/opportunities rather than only creatures. The guild and skill systems works well and helps to individualize your character. Somehow the game does fall flat for me though in being a bit too "ho hum".

The variant that adds one skill and one starting item for the characters adds to the theme and speeds up game play. I play also play the variant where the game ends when one player has two artifacts. Don't be scared to take on the guardians sooner rather than later. You don't need to be a super-hero to beat them. Game could drag if people play too conservatively.

The mechanics are very clean and streamlined for this kind of a game. I've played it enough now that I feel I can make some accurate and useful remarks. I've never played Talisman or any of the ancestors of this game, so I cannot make any comparisons there. In Prophecy, you and other players move your avatars around on the game board, encountering "Opportunities" which are optional and encountering "Creatures" which you must fight. There is a basic game, with no spells and somewhat simplified rules, which is truly excellent for playing with children. In the advanced game, you are trying to gain as much strength, wisdom, spells, and powerful items in order to defeat very powerful guardians and take their groovy artifacts. This is more of an "experience" game, yet there are very discrete goals you may work towards - both short term and long term, and this distills out any feeling that you are just dorking around. You must focus on a strategy and reaching your intermediate goals if you wish to succeed.

The atmosphere in the game is excellent. It's traditional fantasy, but with a fun element. The board art is slightly cartoonish, but in a good way - like World of Warcraft is cartoonish in a good way. There are also some really excellent touches. For instance, if you decide to battle the Noble Lion in the mountains, and you defeat it, it's card says that you may henceforth call yourself "The Beastmaster". Any game that provides for some beastmaster action is A  in my book. There is also a four leaf clover Opportunity card that, should you pick it up, grants you luck for the rest of the game! Yes! Although battles are resolved by a simplistic die role, the mechanism just really fits the theme and style of the game. The only real downside I see with Prophecy is that, if you play to the game-winning conditions stated in the rule book, you will be playing the game for a very long time. I wish the expansions were available in English.

CHILDREN'S RATING: 8

Prophecy wins huge points from me because my daughter loves to play it. So I play it a bit more often than I would were she not around. This game is superb with kids about 5/6  (if they are patient, skilled readers, and like the theme) - again, the only downside is the playing time. Fortunately, it's very easy to modify the winning conditions to shorten play time.

Oh man, I hate to give a game like this one a low-ish rating. I love the idea of this game through and through - adventure is so close to my heart. And my girlfriend loves it. I have to say though, if I have lots of time, and she wants to play, I will. I love slaying monsters and getting treasure and learning skills, etc. But that's just it - the Gestalt of this game, the total picture, is actually less than the sum of its parts. For what you are doing in the game, it is way too long indeed. Becomes monotonous, and no amount of fantasy can help with that. I would say it's "okay" - but it's hard to devote this much time to an "okay" game. Perhaps the expansions make it more interesting.

RATING: 7
Played Z-man edition
In Prophecy, you're competing with the other PCs to take out typical fantasy bad guys and capitalize on special event cards.  The board is set up as a circular kingdom around water, and getting from one place to the next quickly is part of the challenge.  You manage XPs, gold, strength cubes, and willpower cubes, often trading one for another to set yourself up for your next few moves.  I've never played Talisman, but I've been told that combat is nearly identical in this game.

So, that's it:  Go around the board, acquiring and spending your assets to improve your character.  You can even do combat with a PC.  Turns are very simple and relatively quick, but limited, so that you need many, MANY turns before you get to the point where you can take on the victory-defining baddies, the Guardians of the Astral Realm(s).  There are five Astral Realm regions, each containing an Artifact and two tough Guardians.  The first player with four Artifacts wins, and there is a Battle Royale at the end as the surviving players duke it out for possession of Artifacts.

I'd definitely welcome the opportunity to play this again, and would probably suggest it on occasion.  Great light fun.  Due to its length, however, I see big difficulties in getting it to the table.  3 hours is about the minimum for a 4p game.

Interesting, and fun.

Many of the cards seem similar in strength. I wish there were an expansion that merely added more cards to all of the decks, for more variety in terms of encounters, and for more variety in terms of strengths gained.

I also wish some of the cards were less dark, and the font were larger.

RATING: 6
This game was a bit too stripped down for me.  Prophecy just felt like a step up (albeit, a big step up) from Dungeon!  Move to this place, fight the monster, collect the loot, repeat.  To be completely fair there is a little more to it than that which is why I said it was a step up...but not as much more as I would like.

It is still an adventure game that does a pretty good job of stripping away a lot of the time it usually takes to play a game like this but I'm all about substance with my games and this one didn't have enough of it for me.

Also, the component quality was a little lacking.  The box is much bigger than it needs to be.  The insert fills probably 75% of the space leaving a small lane in the middle for the small amount of cards and gems which are all the components this game has.  Plus the box doesn't properly accommodate the board to sit on top of this insert.  The cards aren't properly sized to be easily sleeved and the art isn't very good.  I've also read that the expansions printed by Z-Man games have different backs and different sizes from the Alter Games edition base game (the edition I have) making them incompatible without altering your components.

Between this and Talisman, I'd rather play this.  I like the planned movement, the slightly higher level of complexity, and the way the end game is handled a lot better.  I need to play this multiplayer and see what Ren and my buddies think.

RATING: 6
Sometimes I wish this game would just end and sometimes I feel like I didn't have enough time to do what I wanted to.  Kind of like an RPG but without the RP.

11/29/15 Update: Apparently we were playing it wrong. I will update as soon as we play it right. 

8/6/17 Update: So we were playing it wrong by continually piling up event cards on spaces but, there is a two card limit per space. Makes the game SO much better. However, it is Amerithrash so you can still be screwed over by dice rolls. Not great with two players as this can greatly swing the game in favor of one of them. Quite fun and with lots of laughs.

Got in math trade March 2010.

Played a partial game with my wife. She seemed to enjoy it, but we started late. I think it's safe to say that I want the expansion. Don't tell her I said that...

Rating to follow after I've played a couple of full games.

*EDIT* Two full games played now. It's fun, but I'm surprised by the fact that I (and the others I've played with) like Return of the Heroes better. This one needs more table time.

RATING: 9
It's the game I wanted Talisman to be.  Fun, thematic, good character development without becoming fiddly.  It's still very random, but the non-random movement, character development and face-up encounters make sure there are plenty of meaningful choices to be made.  It might be a still be a bit too long, but hopefully this will reduce after more plays.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
I'm not sure why I thought it was a good idea to pick this up, probably because of the "Vlaada Chvátil" on the box. It's essentially a strategic recreation of the venerable Talisman: a strongly abstracted fantasy roleplaying experience where you walk around in circles (a ring of 20 spaces) encountering things (cards placed on said spaces).

As always with this sort of story-generator game, I find it to occupy an unnecessary middle-ground between a true RPG and a more solid strategy game. My rating is even lower than for Runebound, the last such game I tried, largely because the (hideous) board is for me an abstraction too far -- I enjoy spatial games and here the movement is far too simple.

Don't get me wrong, Prophecy is certainly a strategic game. There are several different movement options, and many different types of equipment, training and monsters. Characters can develop differently and accept different levels of risk; there are real decisions about which paths to take. As with most such games the level of player interaction is low, but the win-condition -- a player collects four of the five artifacts -- does more or less demand player-vs-player combat in the endgame.

The real killer? You're not getting this one done in under three hours.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It's a good adventure game, the artwork is kind of amateurish but in a good "old-school" way. I vastly prefer the bloated chaos of Talisman, but if you favor less randomness, you might like this one instead.

Vlaada's first try for an adventure game and it isn't bad at all.

It is way better than most other similar games like Runebound and Talisman.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
[Altar Games 2002 edition] {Fantasy, adventure; dice-rolling, development, fighting; optimal 3p} {5 basic, 7 standard, 6.5 extended} Prophecy is an interesting adventure game with strong player interaction. The character advancement is slow (the cost of some abilities / items is real high) and repetitive but it's enjoyable and rewarding to watch your character can beat strong mobs.  Replayability is high due to many characters, abilities, and items.

The rule is very clear in explaining most situations. The core game flow is easy to understand; we need not refer to the player aid or rulebook frequently. Players have good controls as they can plan where to go to and confront. IMHO, increasing mobility is very important in early games so that you can move to a particular location in fewer turns / obstacles.

A minor problem of the game is the "Economic Crisis" card. I think this card somehow disrupts the game flow and slow the game a lot; esp. when players usually need gold to do many things.  It doesn't help much in game - there is no runaway leader problem even without this card and players usually don't have enough actions to do all things; thus, they usually need to stack some gold for some planning.  A typical game is long; I would rate it higher if it is 1 hour shorter.

The illustration of cards is nice and effective though the cards are small in size; normal size is preferred, though. The board is large enough but it looks childish. The gemstones are nice looking but they are not effective as markers because it's clumsy to distinguish to big and small gemstones.

[Expansions] IMO, there are not enough cards of all kinds.  Expansions are needed to enhance its replayability and fun. I am glad that Z-man will release compatible expansions.

RATING: 7
Talisman with: one track; movement points rather than a die roll; experience points when monsters are killed that may be cashed in at one of 5 bases for "skills" that are essentially character enchantments relating to movement and combat; loss in combat results in temporary decrease in strength (strength points also double as hit points); and a separate stack of cards for equipment (basic and magical) all bought with a freer-flowing gold supply.  The goal is to gather enough stuff to whack pre-arranged baddies and take their artifacts.  The first to get five artifacts wins, but the reality is, if you can't read Czech you can't play at all, as there's no card or rules translation.  Those who hate Talisman will hate this as well - for the collector, it is an interesting cultural reinterpretation of a classic game.

I'm really pleased with this purchase. This is the first RPG in my collection after a couple of years considering other possibilities: like WOW, Doom, Descent, Runebound, Arkham Horror etc.

This is a great entry level game to scratch that RPG itch for Euro gamers and plays in a very respectable time.

It's a fun game that smacks of well-tested mechanisms that gel together well.

I'm sure that they are other games that are better in specific ares: bigger maps, more characters, spells, opponents etc. But they all seem to fall foul as a package: too long, too complex, unbalanced or what have you.

With expansions on the way Prophecy was the perfect choice for me.

Thanks to BoardGamesWithScott for highlighting how good this game really is.

Played 3+ times. Very interesting take on the Fantasy genre. Lower on luck than some, because movement is deterministic and generally more than 50% of the adventure cards are face up.  Combat is still dice based, but pretty easy to put in your favor.  I don't like talisman but I like this. 2009/06/21

I love the adventure feel of this game. Except for the stand-up character card which ought to be replaced by a figurine, the game boards and the illustrations are nicely drawn. But all the cards can quickly clutter up the board during the game. More thoughts should have been given to that aspect because it makes the game feel less enjoyable when things are messy on the board. The game can get too long too when players are conservative about challenging the realms. Despite the flaws, this is a game that stirs imagination and is fun to play!

Quite an enjoyable RPG boardgame. Didn't feel like I had no real options or choices like in Talisman. Didn't feel like a pick-up-and-deliver game with bad graphics like Return of the Heroes. Didn't feel as frustrated with movement like in Runebound. Didn't feel like there was a runaway leader. Didn't feel like there was no way to catch-up even after several set backs.

If I played again, I'd play with at most 3 players; we played with 5 players and it took about 2.5 hours which I feel is tolerable for this sort of game, but I'd prefer to play something that take a shorter amount of time. Either that, or reduce the victory conditions to collecting 3 Artifacts instead of 4. 

Everything else in the game system worked very smoothly. This is a game I wouldn't hesitate to introduce new gamers to, even those who aren't too familiar with RPG boardgames. Definately would love to give this another try with 3 players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A little long, which seems to be the status quo for these kind of games. The game goes very quickly from a lot of things on the board that you can't do (not enough money to buy something or strength to kill something or experience points to gain a skill) to a lot of things you can do, but there's a long crawl until you reach to this wealthy status. Seems that you could speed the game up a lot by putting items in the city and village at the start and giving players a starting skill. It would also help if there were a segmented deck of cards. So that you're battling easy creatures at the start and getting low payout opportunities, then medium creatures and better opportunities and then finally big creatures and the best opportunities. Right now it seems like you can flip up some cards that just sit there most of the game because players can't afford it or can't beat it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Wow, this is a very fine game.  It captures the feeling of adventure RPG's very well in a simple stream-lined set of rules.  I've played Runebound many times, and feel that minute for minute punch, Prophecy wins out.  You get a quicker playing game with a great feel.

Character building offers nice variety.

Only thing preventing a 10 right now, or pushing rating to 8 eventually, is replay potential.  Eventually, the cards might start to feel stale, so the promised expansions will be well worth getting.

Edit. Moved rating down a tad.  I still love the game, and adding in races and additional cards from dragon helped, but the game needs just a little more variety. Come on with water expansion and likely to rate higher

I much prefer this to Runebound.  The skills make each game different and give the characters more personality than stat increases.  I like the graphical style.  Unfortunately, the massive amount of cards that you will go through each game means that you will see most of them before long.  This game could really use some new cards.  The expansion that is out doesn't expand the game the way I want it to.  I'd rather have new adventure cards than races and a new board.  I'll likely trade this away due to the lack of replayability.

It's a 'generic' fantasy game very similar to Talisman. However, I enjoy this better. You have more control over your movement & there is slightly less luck involved. The game is long, 2-3 hours minimal and you should never play with more than 3 because the down time can be atrocious! 3 is the best number!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
From now on I will believe the rulebooks... this one's says that 5 players are too much for this game, especially if there are newbies among them. Definitely want to play a faster game with 3 players. About the game itself: as it goes on, the board becomes chaotic because of the lot of cards played on it. Bad designing, because the cards can even get on important texts or icons on the board, making them invisible, so periodically the players have to toss away the cards, peep the text, put the cards back, etc... not helping the fast game at all.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The game goes on for too long for what it is, though I haven't tried the shorter version that's in the rulebook.  That's probably the way to play.  Also, the board gets overly cramped with cards very quickly, with 14 card piles, 4 discard piles, and other assorted cards scattered everywhere.  I do appreciate the quick turns and the streamlined mechanics, and your characters do develop their own feel as you upgrade their skills, especially if you focus on their specialties.

It's so close to being a great game, and I think it actually would be an excellent game if you have kids who dig fantasy.  But I don't have kids so I traded it away.  Again.

This rpg-ish walk around the map is pretty fun.  Combat is quicker and easier than Runebound, but feels a touch heftier than Return of the Heroes.  There are some good decisions to make about where on the map it's safe to go and what benefits your character.

The rules encourage a little character focus, so that everybody is not automatically seeking the same skills.

Prophecy was an interesting adventure game that is reminiscent of the old school Talisman.  I might enjoy it more if I played a few more times, but after one play, I just feel like there's so many cards with so much text that it's a bit overwhelming.  I enjoyed it, and didn't bother to read all the text on the innumerable cards on the board, but just sort of ambled around with my character.  I got crushed as a result, but still had a good time and wouldn't refuse to play again, but then again I'm not exactly dying to play it again.

As a side note, I am amazed at the breadth of Vladimir Chvatil's designs, from Prophecy to Through the Ages to Galaxy Trucker, he's certainly a designer that I'll keep an eye on to see what he comes up with next!

While the sheer amount of cards and numbers and words all over the place might intimidate some, it's a game I've kept coming back to. I'm a fan of a number of the mechanics: the cubes for magic and health making you weaker or stronger as you go about the game, the deterministic movement, the partial knowledge of what's to come, and so on. I would only play this with 2 or 3 players. The game is a bit long, but usually it's fun enough to make up for the length.

RATING: 7.5
Wow...good game.  Lots of chrome on the monsters and such,  but the character development stuff had tons of variety.  Felt very balanced, but it was mentioned that this particular session I played was unusually close.  One die for you and one die for the enemy seems like very little control,  but I guess it does work out to two dice.  The plastic player markers were really nice.  Cards did feel ultra-cheap,  and mini-beads were small and a little tough to differentiate.  Played with 4,  lasted about 2 hours.

A couple plays later, definitely a good game,  but still too long.  Production values for the Zman version are top notch - nice thick cardboard, although not enough stands for the characters (companies should take the cue from Arkham Horror and include a stand for each character in the game!) Thinking about it, the beginning always feels a bit rough,  as you start off a bit too weak to kill anything, but you have to try anyways so it's a bit of a luckfest to get your engine going.  Maybe starting "at level 2" variant might have been nice - maybe more experience and gold to buy your first combat skill or weapon,  or giving some pool of skills, etc. to buy right off the bat.  Feels a little aimless if there's only a couple really tough monsters out,  all the skills at the guilds aren't useful or too expensive, none of the items have come out yet...Ultimately, this is definitely a step in the right direction,  but still suffers from being too long.  Almost there...

The cards look great, the board looks great, come on the whole weight of the box is due to the unnecessary waste of stock paper used for the characters and the stock used to hold the elements inside the box (that by the way is so tight you cannot bag anything if you are going to keep using it). This plus the fact that the character sheets give the appearance of going to be peeling during the first session of the game. Only a moron would chose those materials for something that could have been solved with the same material as the cards.

RATING: 7.5
Played multiple times (mostly 2-player) using the two-artifact ending condition.

If fantasy romps are your bag, Prophecy is one of the best choices available for teens and adults.  Return of the Heroes is preferable as a family game due to its simplicity and its clever reliance on short-term quests.

Update:

Between Prophecy and Runebound, my kids (ages 8 and 12) prefer Prophecy.  No doubt the relative lack of downtime and ease of mobility are important factors in their decision.  A sense of humor (e.g., the mummy's curse), which is absent in Runebound, also makes Prophecy the livelier and less ominous of the two.

RATING: 7
Very much like Talisman. The way health/strength and magic/willpower are used and have to be refreshed is a nice touch. Getting the right combination of weapons and abilities is somewhat luck driven. Players have 2 guilds that they can gain skills at cheaply. You need to do this for efficiency. Lots to read the first time you play, so expect a longer learning game. I may not play it a lot but it does scratch the RPG itch a little.

A good game for when you feel like putting the brain in coast mode. Few meaningful decisions to make and little control over your own destiny -- roll some dice and hope for the best! Very pretty and a fun diversion from time to time, though. Still looking for a better grand adventure type game.

My favorite fantasy adventure boardgame, easily beating out the likes of Talisman, Return of the Heroes, et al. Much is determined by luck (including risk assessment and gambling), but character building and planning is the heart of the game.

Prophecy - 7 Feb 09. 
Sleeved all cards.
2-5P

RATING: 6.5
Moves a bit slow in the beginning, might be cured by more characters. Unique mechanics and design but just a little too slow, even when playing the shorter variant.

Oddly enough, I've been wanting to revisit this one lately. Might play better with 3. I think I would still feel like it moved a bit slow and boils down to a roll and move/dice combat game.

Little too slow for me, sold.

I bought and read the rules to this, and it didn't look like fun.  It sat on the shelf for a couple of years before being traded.

i like it!  it's going to rival Talisman probably, if we can get some expansions going in English.  non-random movement is the bomb, and the card "adventure" placement mechanism is pretty good.  i can imagine this would be pretty hectic with five players going at it.  it's kind of long though.  i'm thinking that the game length could be reduce by an hour or two by starting out a little more powerful.

Fixes some of the problems with Talisman, the Co-op is great, it's just too long to hit the table often.

the middle complexity, 2nd favorite of my RPG boardgames...it's best for me because it levels out my concerns with my other 3 fantasy RPG boardgames

Played the Z-Man version for the first time today and LOVED IT! Similar to Talisman but with more choices and more MEANINGFUL choices and decisions to make. I especially like the movement mechanic compared to Talisman's roll and move. Talisman is an all-time favorite of mine, but this one just might overtake it as we continue to play! Looking forward to expansions for this one!

A nice fantasy adventure game. It's in the line of Talisman, but much better in my opinion.

This is one of the best fantasy adventure games I have ever played.  I like that there is so much control over your movement, adding a level of strategy that is lost in both Runebound and most certainly Talisman.

The artwork has a certain charm to it that I absolutely love.  The downtime is extremely low, so even though the game is a bit long, it doesn't feel that way like Runebound does.

As a videogamer I love RPG, but as a boardgamer I have played very little of the fantasy adventure genre, mostly because it tends to devolve into a dice rolling fest.  Even so, I got to try Prophecy for the first time recently, and while I enjoyed the first half of the game, honestly I didn't care for the resolution of it.

The initial accumulation of items, spells and abilities, as well as encounters to build up experience, gold and stats, was a lot of fun.  However, as everyone's character begin to plateau (because after all, there is a limit to its growth), and the decks were reshuffled (multiple times), everything became repetitive.  All of a sudden the game seemed to lack the appeal and the luster it had an hour or two ago.  It wasn't fun any more since I'm just doing the same tasks over and over again (eerily it felt like the endgame of MMORPG).

Prophecy feels like a game that after you played it once, there is really no need to go through it again because all of the encounters are still the same, as well as the characters (since they have nothing unique about them, other than a slight difference in the two stats).  It also has the problem of overstaying its welcome.  It is pretty, with a very good production value from Z-Man, but unfortunately Prophecy lack the substance to withstand repeated plays.

1/1/12 -- I ultimately ditched my copy of (Altar) Prophecy because the end-game just seemed a little underdeveloped.  Maybe the newer version is better--I don't know--but I still hold the game in high regard.

06/18/07 - I've had a chance to play this some more, including a 3 player game (all my other games have been 2 player), and it definitely holds up.  Experience brings down the play-time as players begin to realize that they can go after artifacts sooner and sooner.  I haven't yet experienced a competitive end-game scenario yet, so maybe that can drag out; I don't know.  I mention this because, aside from repetitive play, Runebound has made me extremely sensitive to this type of game taking too long to play.  Prophecy is definitely hitting on all cylinders and should be everyone's first choice for its genre (unless the alternative is Magic Realm, of course).

1/23/07 - I've played this twice so far, both as 2 player games.  It's really awesome.  This type of game is a difficult one to get right (e.g. Runebound's popularity to suckiness ratio should be a good indication of this), but it seems to have found a near perfect balance of difficulty, pacing, and character mobility.  Our games have run in the 3 hour range, but that will definitely drop with familiarity.  The magic system is interesting and has a good feel to it.  In the beginning, characters are all pretty similar, but with different guild memberships end up with a wide degree of varying abilities.  I definitely recommend this game to anyone who is taking their first step into fantasy adventure board gaming.

Very similar to Talisman - but a bit better. It's still a little bit slow and suffers from a run-away leader problem, but it's not bad.

RATING: 5
An average game slightly boring is a good evaluation for this game.
Though I really love Galaxy trucker and Space alert, this game is a little bit disappointing for me.
The game goes somewhat slower than I expected.
And I like Runebound better because it is more story-telling than this game.

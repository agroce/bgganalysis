Bad game, not fun.  I'm not fond of trick-taking games in the first place, and something seemed to be unbalanced with this one.  2 consecutive plays.  Rating would be lower if I could remember just what was so bad about this game.

This game reminded me somewhat of Hearts, in that it is as much about forcing opponents to win bad tricks, as it is for you to win good ones. The element of shafting your opponents really appealled to me, and whilst this is a fairly light game, I could see myself playing it a lot with certain family members.

RATING: 5
Only played once. Another fairly generic card game - take tricks to gain cards, but lose points if you get too many of another colour.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The rules of this game are misleading in their simplicity.  At first it seems an incredibly trite game and could be easily dismissed.  But by about the 3rd deal you'll find the table grows very quiet as folk realise what a challenging game it is, as they do their best to score well on totally different types of hand.  

But the playing time is misleading.  This is no light end-of-evening game.  Five players playing 10 deals - and one needs that two deals per player to even out the scoring - won't give you much change out of 90 minutes.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Yet another trick taking game.  It's a good one, but with so many to choose from this one doesn't necessarily stand out from the rest.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Wonderfully enjoyable trick taking with a twist - that being that you can have two tricks open in the same round.  That doesn't sound like much but it gives rise to a hugely enjoyable cardplay experience - definitely the more the merrier.  Many thanks to Alan Parr for introducing me to this great wee game.

RATING: 5
Unique trick tacker with some interesting strategies. Has a little less screwage than I'm accustomed to, but there's still some to be had. I look forward to playing it more to see if my rating rises, it just might be hard to fit in with so many other good trick takers out there....

RATING: 6
Card draw luck is fairly prominent, but it's light enough and quick enough that I don't mind that too much.  I used to think this might be best with six, as it's less likely that one person will be the only player pursuing a given color.  It may still be, but I've begun to see how things change with only 4 players.  There the concern is less "How do I get more of what I want?" and more "How do I not get more of what I don't want?"

RATING: 6
Quirky trick taking game. There are only three suits of cards, numbered from 1 to 20. During a trick, there may be two colours in play and you may play to either of these colours. The object is to win as many cards in the one colour as possible, as your score is the number of cards you&#039;ve taking in one colour minus the number in the other two colours. I like this game. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Excellent trick-taking game.  You only want to win tricks in 2 of the 3 colours but that is a lot harder than it first appears.  Shame it is out of print as it is a very very good filler.

[Original comment] I like the challenge in this game, although a player's chances (as in most card games) depends upon the cards he is dealt.

May 2009 -- We haven't played this game in a while. I'm the only one in the family who will suggest playing it, although everyone seems to enjoy it. It's just not as entertaining as many of our other games.

There seems to be a lot of luck in the draw.  If you get an evenly-distributed hand, you're sunk.  There should be a better way to throw off cards.  I might like it better if you could pass cards after the deal.  Something like: pass 1 card to the left 3 times.

Firstly, what the heck is up with the dumb looking hats on the cards? Couldn't they come up with anything else?  And what do the hats say?  Is it an advert for a casino?  Another vicious trick-taking game where you're often helping others and hurting yourself.  You definitely need to play a significant number of rounds (up to 50 points) to even out the card distribution, at least to my mind.

I quite like the brain food this one offers in such a simple idea. 60 cards, 3 colours numbered 1 to 20. First player leads a card. Next can play a card of the same colour or a different colour. Only two colours can be played in a round, so if two colours are out already, the next must play in one of the colours out there, otherwise they have a choice. And so on, until each player has a played one card. Whoever has played the highest in each colour takes all the cards played in the colour (so there's usually two winners). The tricky thing is the scoring after all cards have been played - you score 1 point for each card captured in just 1 colour (you're largest) and lose 1 point for each card captured in the other 2 colours.

Which makes for all sorts of interesting decisions - I really need to offload this highish red card, but I can't afford to win any reds as I'm collecting greens, so should I play it under the 20 Red just played, but that means I'm donating points to the 20 Red player who's collecting reds, or should I hold on to it to see if I can offload it later on to someone who's not collecting red but has a higher red than I. Hmm, need to start counting the high cards at least. As there's few 'forced' plays (you can always play in either of 2 colours), you can't actually determine other players' hands so the educated guess runs rampant.

Alapvetoen egy a klasszikus szinre-szint, ha nincs akkor adut bele tipusu kartyajatek, de ugye itt jon a csavar. A pakliban 3 szin van 1-20 szamozva es mikor valaki elindit egy kort akkor a kovetkezo jatekosnak lehetosege van egy masik szint is elinditani (harmadik szin mar nem kerulhet elo egy utes alatt). A kor vegen ahany szin indult el, annyi boldog (vagy esetleg banatos) tulajdonos lesz. A jatek vegen ugyanis olyan colorettosan 1 szin pozitiv, a masik ketto meg negativ pontokat hoz. Ekkor mar nem szamit a lapok erteke, csak a szama.
Erdekessege meg a jateknak a 4-6 szemely meghatarozas, az elso parti 4 szemellyel volt, de erzesem szerint a maximalis jatekosszamnal meg izgalmasabb lehet a jatek.

The game has an interesting trick taking mechanism. There can be two tricks at one time, and you don&#039;t have to follow suit (color in this game.)Highest # card in each trick wins, highest overall card leads. Scoring is handled by adding up 1 pt. for each card in your largest color set and subtracting 1pt. for each card in the other colors you took. Any card &quot;passed&quot; i.e. not played on a trick counts as -2pts. Game length is the number of players x2 in hands. 2 to 6 players.

This is a fantastic little game that can and should be played with a deck of Sticheln cards.  There are three suits from 1-20 with some of the most unsightly graphics I've ever seen on a card.  Hattrick should have had hockey guys on it or something (I know it would probably be confused with Slapshot, but it probably already is).  A lighter kinder version of Sticheln that works better in larger groups.  Great trick taking game with no trumps (I hate trumps).  Nice decisions between making points/dumping unwanted cards/and hurting other players.

Played a partial game - 2 rounds. The first round, we all played predictably, and it seemed to be nothing more than luck of the draw (deal). Next time, there was more strategizing and bluffing - actually, kind of fun.

RATING: 6
[Amigo 95 edition] {Card; trick-taking} Hattrick is a traditional trick-taking game: players shall follow led color, player with the highest card takes the trick, etc.  Nonetheless, it has a novel mechanic - there can be at most 2 tricks in the same round.  i.e. 2 players can win a trick at the same time.  This is nastier than other trick-taking games because discarded cards count negative points.

It is a fine game.  It is not great but it is nice to play it every once a while.

With simple rules and scoring, this game can be taught in about two minutes. Strangely, it feels like you have more control with six players than with four. Serious card players beware: if you are dealt a bad hand, it seems as though there's not much you can do about it, especially with four players. Playing several hands usually mitigates the luck of the draw, but sometimes not. On the lighter end of the trick taking scale.

Weird but fun trick-taking game. I like the "last card isn't played" and the option to sit out for -2 points, they help counteract the luck of the draw a little bit, but it does seem like if you have a bad hand, you're going to do nothing but feed the others points.

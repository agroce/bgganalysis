Note: I played a special oversized version of this game, apparently, on a games fair. It was quite popular and there were people standing around it for the whole day. I don't know how the retail version pans out, since it wasn't available there for comparison.

It's a dexterity game that can be played by anyone. Truly a great party game of stacking asymmetrical ladders. The rules are quite simple; On your turn role a die to determine one of three assignments:
1) Place a ladder touching only one other ladder;
2) Place a ladder touching exactly two other ladders;
3) Place the highest ladder touching a maximum of two other ladders.

Ladders shouldn't touch the base nor the table. Anyone that collapses a piece of the construction gets a tear token. Winner is the one with the least tear tokens.

I'm wondering for how long this game keeps interesting, since a game can drag on quite a bit and there's no particular challenge except for the three different placement rules.

One of the most excellent dexterity stacking games I've played, and a genre I never really expected to find another stand-out in!

While the game rules are nothing to write home about, the way the game works is truly excellent. With many stacking games, the game ends up in a catastrophic structure failure, with the game ending in that event.

However, due to the way the ladder shapes kind of lock a lot of things into place, the structure here does a lot of shifting and wobbling without completely falling, and when stuff does fall, it doesn't take the entire structure down, which is really great. The moon just cries a little when you cause something to fall, and the player with the least tears when the moon cries it's last tear wins.

This will likely be THE stacking dexterity game of my collection.

Beautiful!  Playable art.  Great aesthetic experience, and lots of fun.

I love the whimsical, simple romantic theme which is carried well throughout the production - the simple wooden teardrops are a great touch.

Good looking rule-book, too, with an unexpected but useful bonus section on clever ladder configurations.

Zero setup, taught in no time, straight away eye-catching.  I'm not sure when I'd play Junk Art instead of just putting this on the table.

I wish the base cloud could have been something other than plastic, but not sure I could think of an alternative that would be as stable and robust as this one is, and still allow precise cuts for the ladder feet.  Anyway, it still looks good, says "cloud", and doesn't otherwise detract.

I think it's pushing it to play with 6 players.  Too much down-time, too few teardrops (penalty-point markers), and too few turns.  But it does give something interesting and pretty to look at during that downtime.

Love it!

Opinion is after one play session, at the top of a very wobbly ladder, surrounded by clouds.

A nice little dexterity game and the ladders are sufficiently different to pose challenges with the stacking. They are also surprisingly flexible. 
I am a bit dissappointed that out of the box one of the ladders was broken and also that the game ended because we ran out of ladders rather than somebody reaching the required number of tears.

Sold in 2018.

Ce n'est pas du tout mon style de jeu, mais je ne peux que saluer l'effort de thématisation qui a été fait. Alors qu'on a trop tendance à voir des jeux froids et au thème plaqué, c'est un bel exemple qui montre qu'un jeu peut aussi être une œuvre d'art.

For what it is, this is elegant. Light, with a simple yet compelling 'game' to it, it offers a lot of possibilities in terms of placement and tactics. It's not as spectacular as Bausack, in terms of crazy structures, but its accessibility and portability means it's likely to see more table time. A top-notch filler, or quick activity.

Gioco di destrezza con inpilaziobe scale. Forse simpaticono dopo le prime mosse. Poi un po' noiosetto

Delicious, tactile and hugely delicate take on dexterity-stacking. Much more ethereal and pretty than the Junk Art/Bausack genre.

My problem with most dexterity games is that they are about being silly, laughing when people are clumsy. Not here. This game, just like Animal Upon Animal for us, is all about being a virtuoso. You can do incredible stuff that looks impossible. And the dice gives you a challenge each time. You're not just stacking, you're trying to do something more specific.
And it doesn't just look impossible, it also looks great and I usually don't care much about how games look but with dexterity games, where you physically touch, balance and build with pieces, presentation matters a bit more. And this game knocks that out of the park. The wobbly ladders look surreal, both beautiful and funny at the same time.

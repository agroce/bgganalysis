RATING: 7
Sort of a combination of "Hey That's My Fish" and "Incan Gold," two nice games.  This push your luck game essentially feels like a friendly family game, though it does have spatial screwage potential to make it a bit more interesting for gamers.  In particular, as expedition leader, in mid- to late game, you can steer expeditions towards tiles that effectively cut off other players' future expeditions.  Our five player game played nicely.  

Curiously, I am not quite sure about the theme this game:  collecting rare and endangered animals in Costa Rica.  But apparently we are collecting them all to protect them from poaching, which I do not believe is very common in Costa Rica.  Or are we photographing them?  Not sure.

Very nice, easy, light and engaging push your luck set collection, with a pinch of bluffing. Great with kids. Actually, one of the few games my group was just eager to play again.

Also, I like that there is quite low downtime, even in 5 players. You need to keep paying attention on how good the cards are for you in current situation.

Fast and simple game of set collection and pushing-your-luck, family friendly theme and execution, clear if slightly sub-par presentation. While there are some decisions to be made concerning where to move your expedition, luck of the draw can completely screw a player over, a problem that becomes more prominent with higher player counts.

Player explorers are here to collect sets of rare and exotic animals to rescue them from poachers. Collecting as many as you can of one kind is valuable, but having one of each kind can be beneficial, too. Each player must decide whether to leave this expedition and collect all of the animals seen so far, or whether to remain with the group to (hopefully) collect more animals later. Once a player does leave the current expedition, they remove their pawn from that group, collecting nothing else from it.

Costa Rica is mainly about push-your-luck. You explore hexes with all the other players in groups, turning tiles over till you dare not turn any more, taking the stash before it gets too attractive for your opponents to take. 

The interesting angles on the game which sets it apart is that the whole game is, from its core, completely interactive. You explore the island in groups, and each player gets the chance to stop the expedition and take the tile haul. 

What takes it from the ‘party’ style gaming of Incan Gold and into the Euro-gamers territory is the way that this interactivity works, along with the potential to start cutting areas of the map off in parts where you no longer are exploring. This can be harsh and really can kick an opponent in the teeth if your luck keeps running on and they get isolated on the edge with nowhere to go.

It is all very simple and nicely done, playing smoothly and quickly.

(Note: the box can be cur down to one-quarter of its size and the bits still fit in).

Review based on one 3-player game.  Fun press-your-luck type game, easy for anyone to get into. good for filler or family game night.  Nice art and pieces, the board is always random and there is some strategy when it comes to the path you take.

There's a reason this game is ages 8+. There's not much 'there' there and the push your luck and set-building aspects are handled better in other games with less downtime or player elimination. Pass on this one unless you have 8-12 year olds you want to bring into the gaming fold.

It is not a good sign if the setup has potential to take more time than actual playing. In Costa Rica it can happen, because there is a good likelihood that all the expeditions won't even happen. This is light push your luck with very luck based set collection element.

Not as good as [thing=154246][/thing], which has the same theme. The color palate was just shades of green, and it felt like you had much less control over what sets you could collect than in La Isla, since the information in Costa Rica was hidden.

I am new to board games so I visited a local board game shop to check out their used games and get a recommendation or so. I explained my predicament to the guy working there and he recommended Costa Rica as a easy to play and learn game that's excellent for introducing people to board games. 

I have now played it 5 times with 7 people the first two times (played as couple teams+1) and a few times with my girlfriend with each of us taking 2 colors. It's an easy game to learn and play, just like the guy suggested. I feel it lacks depth, and it doesn't seem to be highly strategic (maybe it will become moreso as we play it more) but it's a quick and fun game.

I'm not in love with it, but since it's easy to set-up and play I keep it in rotation for now. I'm sure something will usurp this for me down the road, but I think the $25 I paid is well worth it being a great introduction to "non-traditional" board games for my friends and I.

Edit: Brought it to a friend's last night for the second time, it was their preferred game between Carcassonne and Forbidden Island for the time being.

Neat and simple mix of set collection and Hey That's My Fish. What it sets out to do, it does very well.
The mechanism of shrinking expeditions is lovely.
"Most mosquitoes in mountains, least by rivers" and generally the mosquito-danger handling should be meaner to players, imho, but that can be easily fixed with house rules. A keeper.

[b]Costa Rica[/b] was sold via auction 10/15/16.

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (6 -> [b]4[/b]):[/COLOR]

[i]- A simple push your luck game that introduces set collection.
- Everything works mechanically but the game is boring. It is completely lacking the tension and/or excitement usually found in push your luck games. 
- The scoring is okay, but again not streamlined enough for such a light game nor does it fell necessary. I think a simpler scoring method would work a lot better.

I took a flyer on this one because I found a copy for a really cheap price. It doesn't hold a candle to my favorite push your luck game Diamant/Incan Gold. The game is lacking in exciting moments, it really feels anticlimactic while playing. The only reason it may stick around in our collection for a bit is due to the animal theme really appealing to my daughters.[/i]

Push your luck in the worst possible way. If you push your luck but want to CONTINUE to do so you have to first give up your rights to the tiles for other players to take. This game is not encouraging you to push your luck but to play it safe. I don't like to "play I safe" - that is far too mundane and boring for me. Therefore this game falls into the category of 1 and Done for me. I lost horribly since I decided I wanted to push my luck further but people would just take my tiles. I got left stranded and I hated it. Really is probably a nice family game but for me it is not one I will ever revisit.

RATING: 6
Costa Rica is a decent gateway push-your-luck and set-collection game that I purchased to play with my 8-year-old daughter. While the theme is thinly pasted on to almost non-existent, the colorful art at least a hints at Costa Rica's natural grandeur. So far my daughter seemed to enjoy her first few plays, but given how simple a game this is, I am not sure how long her interest will last.

My biggest gripes with this game are (1) the horrible punchboards that do not allow the tiles to pop out without tearing the paper (marked tiles in this game is a disaster), and (2) the huge box size relative to the space taken up by components. Given my limited shelf space, it annoys me to no end when my game boxes contain mostly air.

This is a nice family style game a bit along the lines of [thing=8203]Hey, That's My Fish![/thing]: you use hex tiles, the pieces move, and you collect the hexes. But there is much more going on, with a push-your-luck element, set-collection, and revolving partnerships (sort of; as people leave expeditions, the remaining ones can steer the expedition towards or away from other expeditions ... there might be room for some negotiations or incentivization here?). Very enjoyable!

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
At the start of the game, all the tiles are placed face down in a Settlers-style hexagon made of hex tiles. The tiles are of 3 terrain types (visible on the bag), each with 2 types of animals (one common, one rare; 1 or 2 pictured on the tile) on the hidden side. Some animal sides also show a hazard symbol (most common in mountains, least in forests). Expeditions, each consisting of one meeple from each player, are placed adjacent hexes spread equidistant around the outer edge of the play area.

On your turn, you may move any single expedition which still contains your meeple. You move to an adjacent hex and flip it. If you reveal a second hazard, you discard all revealed tiles and remove your meeple from that expedition; your turn ends immediately. Otherwise, in order (starting to your left and ending with you), players have the option to take all the tiles (and their meeple) from that expedition and end the turn, or pass. If everyone passes, you move again to a new tile and repeat. However the turn ends, the expedition remains on the last spot explored. 

The game ends when no more legal moves remain. Then, everyone scores for the animals they've collected:
- for each full set of 6 different animals
- for each animal, score by size of set (triangular progression)
Most points wins!

This is a cross between Hey, That's My Fish! and push your luck. It's effectively a set collection game where you are exploring an island by moving across and removing tiles, similar to Hey, That's My Fish!. There are a lot of decisions to be made and there's virtually no downtime. There is also a lot of room for cutthroat moves, if that is your style.

It's on the lighter side, but I enjoyed it and wouldn't mind playing it as an appetizer at a game night.

A clever twist combining push your luck with the route-denial of Hey That's my Fish!  Easy to teach and quick to play.  I like the subtle mind games of trying to get people out of your expedition so that you can have free reign to explore as much as you want.  In the end though, I'm not so sure that it's worth the effort of setting up the tiles.

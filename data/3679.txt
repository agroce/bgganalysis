One play. A nice multiplayer abstract. End of game scoring is not clear and potentially annoying, but everything else is straightforward with what seems like a reasonable amount of depth. I'd actually prefer this over Through the Desert, even though TtD has superior bits.

This game pretends to be an abstract strategy game, but it isn't. Especially when you are playing a 4 player game, you will find that the three others will mess things up for you, so you can't think ahead. Besides it wasn't fun at all.

My main problem with multi-player abstracts is that many (this one included) seem to require too much thinking for the amount of control you have. Now it may be I am just not very good at them, but either way they are not my thing. 
(I'm not sure why, but playing this reminded of Bridges of Shangrila - possibly because that's a multi-player abstract that I enjoy).

A bit of a weird system of tile placement leads to a little confusion and not a terrible amount of strategy. More plays are probably required to get a hang of this one.

RATING: 2.5
Quizá entendimos algo mal en las reglas, pero nos pareció un poco roto: alguien con suerte puede ganar en su primer turno, si no es el primer jugador. Tras un par de partidas, tampoco nos dejó ganas de averiguar si habíamos jugado bien o no. Eso sí, sólo por los componentes merece la pena para reutilizarlos.

The rules are unclear in some places and this is surprising because the game itself is pretty simple and elegant. After a few moves you know what to expect and how to play but there is some depth in it.

If you like pure abstract games with simple rules that work well with more than two players - give it a try.

Abstract strategy that isn't half bad, but I wouldn't call it exciting, either. It does offer some intriguing serial moves here and there, but it felt a little slow as well to me. MIght be better with more players; although the neutral piece rule might be better than I think so far. There is no feeling of towers, by the way.

Another in a long line of games that have at their core a puzzle.  In this case, the puzzle is threefold--controlling of towers, scoring towers, controlling endgame.  The game is very satisfying intellectually if somewhat dry.

A very intellectual game with a clear rule set and tons of replay value. I would always prefer to play with two players for the chess-like gameplay, while my significant other would (if ever) only play with four for the exact same reason.

I recently played this after many years of neglect. What a wonderful surprise, especially as a two player game. There are many choices and tactical considerations. The chain reaction of multiple moves makes for lightning strike end game conditions. Above all this is fun to play and there are always surprising moves that allow for neat comebacks. The size of the board feels liberating and there is a lot to take in, especially in the early game.

Quite abstract game where you move pieces over others creating towers. Once they are tall enough for you, you move them into a scoring position where they stay until the end of the game.

An uncommmon gem in an uncommon genre, Spiel der Türme  gracefully avoids most of the troubles related to designing multiplayer abstract games:
* The goal is easy to grasp: stacks have to be built and then placed in certain "scoring" squares until a player controls four consecutive scoring squares or until a player can't move at all. Then all stacks are scored.
* The mechanisms are succinct: each turn a player moves a piece of their own or a stack topped by one orthogonally over free spaces and other of their own pieces or stacks; a piece is stacked on another piece or stack if topped by the same symbol until a limit of five pieces per stack is reached; scoring squares can never be left and allow an extra move.
* The rich tactical interplay scales almost perfectly from two to four players (all pieces are always used, but only player-owned pieces can be stacked on other pieces).

Spiel der Türme is kept from utmost excellence merely by minor drawbacks: some will find it dry, despite the short moves keeping downtime low there's a certain danger of analysis paralysis, alliances against one player while seldom of use can be harsh, and in rare cases a player can win on the first turn (an intentional setup as stated in the ProLudo edition reduces that risk hugely and gives the game even more depth).

A clever abstract, where stacking threats abound and you balance between setting up for taking points versus defending your pieces from being overtaken versus offensively stacking on top of opponent's stacks if you can get away with it. Neat.

Pretty much an abstract game, with only the lightest veneer of theme. The German edition we played was quite beautifully made, the pieces were wooden blocks neatly engraved with symbols filled with color. A bit dry, but plenty of room for cleverness.

rating after 1 play (2pl) - 7ish

im not a huge fan of abstracts (i think tho im not actually sure anymore) - but anyway this was fun - feels like an enormous game for 2 players with v subtle and combinative moves - interested to play a few more times

rating after ~5 plays all 2pl - 6

is quite good fun BUT setup is random and can help 1 pl much more than the other - also its possible for 1st pl to win wo other player having a turn!!!

so an interesting idea but with 2pl def too random - not sure with more

Nice components.
Simple game, wich doesn't mean gameplay is simpel.
Things can become rather complicated and you really have to watch your oponents all the time.

Personally I would hav wished they'd pick some colours that are more different.
Purple, dark green and dark bleu look very simular in bad light and it gave me quite a bit of trouble.

But as said we really enjoyed it..

I think it's most enjoyable with four.

Well, if you're looking to play an abstract game then this should be high on your list. It plays in under an hour and will keep you concentrating without frying your brains. There's some good choices and risks to be made each turn with planning for several moves ahead. Turn order matters a lot in this as the preceding player can open up new areas and opportunities if they're careless or concentrating on their own agenda. No to be taken too seriously, but it is fairly entertaining.

A surprisingly deep and elegant game for Rudi Hoffmann.  Ultimately, for me, it suffers from being strictly an abstract game.  Still though, I am quite surprised that this game didn't catch on in the abstract crowd.  Lots of things to keep track of here. Expect the person that can assess and proccess large quantities of information to kick the crap out of you everytime.  Clearly a game that you can excel in.

Nonetheless, there is a bit of humiliation that can be had when the neutral player can make more points than you do (but, the same can be said for Clans, which I love).

Take four players, each with lots of pieces in four different designs, each of which can move in four directions to capture pieces of the same design, while avoiding being captured themselves, forming towers up to five pieces high... and what you have is too many options, none of them interesting. It all adds up to a slow-moving exercise in over-analysis. Then paste on a theme which isn't needed and doesn't work (Ramparts edition). Dreadful.

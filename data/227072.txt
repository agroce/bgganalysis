Very fun distillation of Spyfall. It cleans up my issues with Spyfall and is much more approachable. However, I do think it's pretty weak with 4 or less players.

This game is like Spyfall but in one round. It was alright but I rather get engaged in a game of Spyfall over this.

RATING: 7
Decent party game, but fairly easy to nearly break if a player always gives an overly vague clue.  I prefer The Insider for this type of game.

I love this game.  Picked it up at PAX Unplugged 2017 for $20, came with PAX Philly promo.  In my opinion, it fixes what is bad about spyfall.  When you're the spy, it's nearly impossible to guess where you are unless you've memorized all the locations.  This fixes that with the centralized card. It's not perfect, some topics are harder than others, and like all these types of games the enjoyment depends on the group.  The sweet spot seems to be 4-5, played with 8 and it can be really easy for the chameleon to figure out the word because of so many clues.  But overall it's a great game.

RATING: N/A
Honestly, I purchased this game partly because the box just looks so darn cool! Also, there is a decent, fun little game inside. It reminds me of Spyfall except you are given a secret word rather than a location and, you all go around saying ONE word that relates to the secret word without giving it away to the chameleon. Vote and see if you were correct! Rounds go fast, and it is a good game to whip out when your group is looking for something fast and easy. Pick it up at your local Target.

Booooriiiing. 
Every round was pretty much the same. 

I can hardly imagine that chameleon lose a round, with group more than 4 and If he or she is not beginning a round. In the other hand, if chameleon begins the round, it could be impossible to win. And this is another bad thing, that position at the table has so huge impact.

Played this with small groups (3 and 4) and found it ok but slightly lacking. Played it with 6-8 and it was a blast. This one needs time for people to find the balance with the word that they give but it became the most played game of the night. Suffers slightly if the first person is the chameleon but rounds are so short this is almost forgivable.

very fun and very fast game.  it's so funny when everyone immediately can tell who the chameleon is from their terrible keyword.  I was even able to play with an 8 and 10 year old

might replace codenames

RATING: N/A
2-8 players. Bluffing/deduction word game. In front of all players is a grid containing words with a common theme. Each player, except for one -the "Chameleon"- knows the word. Every player, including the Chameleon, must give a one-word clue about the word. If the other players catch the Chameleon they win -unless the Chameleon can correctly guess the word based on the clues given.

2017-11-24 - This is a Spyfall killer. It's very similar, mechanically, but I like it better in almost every way. I like the variety of the subjects, and I like that you just have to come up with a word, and not a question to ask someone else. Great game.

RATING: 6
An utterly shameless hybrid of Fake Artist and Codenames - which is an interesting thing to explore, the innocent players trying to create a loose Venn diagram around one word, but the open discussion/accusation phase makes it too Werewolf, and easy for novice players to inadvertently help out the Chameleon. Also a bit broken in that you don't know for sure who's recognising memorable dice combinations.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This is a fun, short and easy to learn the game. Very similar to "Faking it" from Jackbox. I really like the dice mechanism with the clue card. I think it is fast to learn game. The only thing I don't like about this game will be the clue cards color. I wish they have some role/ characters. I also think the first person and the last person will have an edge in the game. Fost person will have less chances to be acused and last person will have more clues on what word/phrase that is chosen on the word card.

Quick-playing mash up of Spyfall/Insider/Codenames type play. Limiting clue to just one word spoken without much hesitation means deliberation becomes main focus of play as opposed to time spent giving clues.

This game is a less "open" easier version of Spyfall.  I prefer Spyfall, but this is fun and different enough for variety.  Plays a little more quickly and easier for some people to grasp and maybe less stressful.

(11/17) 7. A game I hoped would rate more highly when I got it.  Thought it would be a great mixture of Spyfall and maybe Codenames, but so far it really hasn't sparkled too much on the table.  It plays so quickly that I'm sure it'll get more time and I hope this number rises.

This seemed to go over quite well even though I found it rather boring.  The accusation of who the chameleon was never quite worked right and there was consistently a little clunkiness with people misreading the dice/table to ID the correct word.

RATING: 7
A social-deduction game by Rikki Tahta (Coup) that plays a bit like a cross between Spyfall and Codenames. There's the familiar set-up of one player who isn't in on the secret - this time which of 16 words related to a topic ('zoo animals', 'jobs') has been chosen. But instead of the conversational charade of Spyfall, each player is restricted to saying just one word. After some discussion, the players try to identify the Chameleon, who if identified can still win by identifying the word correctly. 

The Codenames piece comes in in the word-choice - you need to be just indirect enough to confirm yourself as being in the know but without tipping off the Chameleon. And that indirectness is what gives the Chameleon the chance to remain unidentified too. It's fun! More in the breezy spirit of Insider and Fake Artist than the 'coherent lie' of Resistance or ONUW.

RATING: 3
So this game draws on the traditions of Party games like Spyfall and Are You a Werewolf?  This is sort of a child of those two games.  But not in a good way.  More like a child that screams and pouts. After a few minutes, you don't want to be in the same room as this child.

RATING: 7
I don't think it's the next big party deduction game or anything. I prefer games like Spyfall and Werewrods, but Chameleon is nice for when I need a small change of pace. It is a bit faster than those other games. It's a bit wierd when two players think of the same word, or how the Chameleon can simply pretend he was thinking the same word. I suggest players think of a back-up word for those instances.

Pretty much replaced Spyfall for me. I feel it gives me the same feeling as Spyfall without the stress, in a much shorter period of time, with a wider variety of topics, and without requiring the players to think of so many things (questions and replies and who to ask), which is much harder for casual players than to just come up with a single word.

Very related to "Spyfall", here with themes and only one word you must say. Had the chance to play one mini round with the guys from "Cliquenabend" at SPIEL '17. A cool and quick game but I would prefer the before mentioned party game.

Great, quick family game!  But don't play with more than 6 players or it comes to a screeching halt.  At around 6 players and up the chameleon will almost always guess the key word meaning points start to add up REALLY slow.

In many ways this is an admirable evolution of the Spyfall brand of social deduction games. Fast, not stressful, and can be played ten times in like half an hour.

This reminds me of Spyfall quite a bit, but it offers a less on-the-spot brand of tension. I like that new players have a few seconds to think of their one-word clue before being put on the spot. Ultimately, this seems to be pretty group-dependent, but this is a solid social deduction/word game.

RATING: 4
I would rate this as a 3 due to terrible game components ; The chariot boards getting chewed up from the scoring clips on first play, cardboard for chariot pieces separating upon initial construction but the game play is acceptable enough to raise my rating to a 4 so overall I really can't recommend it.

RATING: 7
Good, short racing game.  Quite nice interplay between health, speed, and options.  The battle elements are a little tacked-on but functional.  Nice variation in game board and player boards.  The production quality is a little cheap, though.  The player boards need laminated desperately.

Entretenido juego de carreras de cuadrigas con gestión de dados. Se pueden dar situaciones divertidas e inesperadas. El problema es que se hace laarrrgo y leennnto para lo que debería ser. No necesitas pensar hasta que te llega el turno de lanzar los dados y donde puedes repetir tirada. Componentes cutres salvo por los dados muy chulos de madera. Por el precio que tiene, ya podían haber incluido unas minis de los carros en vez de esa mierda de cartoncillos. Aprobao pelao y porque te ríes un rato.

Fairly mediocre racing game. I expected more from this.

Unfortunately once you get a lead it is near impossible for other players to catch up, especially with only two laps of the board (which is approx 5 turns).

I would have liked more variety of tracks in the game and the 'special powers' of each chariot are pretty laughable as they simply start with different stats and these are not at all balanced against on another.

Quick and dirty Yahtzee-style racing game that develops quite differently depending and group dynamics. As long as the racers play it safe it feels like a friendly walk in the park but when the gloves come off player elimination isn't only likely but to be expected.
A short romp reduced to the essentials in both rules and materials.

This game doesn't look like much.  It's board is quite plain and the component quality is lacking a bit, but it hides a deceptively fun game.  The balance in this game is actually really good.  At the end of the race, you either find yourself squeaking by the finish line or careening into a hot mess as you go too fast for your wheels to carry you.  I find many people are surprised by how good this little game is.

Another racing game? But this one's from Pegasus Spiele (in Germany) and Matt Leacock. That should be interesting! Nope. The mechanics bring nothing new to the genre, besides randomly attacking opponents with spears. But nothing strategic because of the dice roll. Even worse, the production quality is so poor, it's ridiculous. The ugly cardboard chariots or the thin player boards to keep track of your chariot's stats with plastic clips will break after one or two plays. The lame graphic design is a complete fail, too. Ah, I really had high hopes for this one, but after I checked it out and played a full game at Spiel '16 this is the biggest disappointment this year for me.

RATING: 8.5
Light strategic chariot racing, involving dice roll optimisation and critical player interaction (blocking, ramming, javelins, caltrops etc). There’s important tactical decisions and the riding of luck, within a fun-filled dash (twice) around the Circus Maximus in Rome. The components won’t blow you away but the game-play more than makes up for that. Might have been a little too modest in its ambitions (e.g. the alternative chariots offer differing speed and damage gauges, rather than wheel blades or special manoeuvres). Nevertheless, for me it’s a winner and I’ve not struggled to find those keen on repeat plays.

Chariot Race is a decent light racing game. It provides enough decisions to be entertaining, but not enough for a deeply strategic experience. Part of its appeal is its simplicity and brevity. Good choice as a filler.

RATING: 6.5
Dice determine whether you affect your speed or attack the other riders around the oval -- and it works because not only is there both a benefit and penalty to your speed, but because your attacks can be poop to harm those behind you as well as spears overhead. Unfortunately, once someone goes down, it's very hard to get back up.

PLUS: theme fits, demands interaction between players
MINUS: when you're behind you have a hard time catching up

RATING: 7
Fun but tough. I have played it twice so far and nobody has yet completed a race.

RATING: 5
This is a very light dice (and javelin) throwing race game. The rules are very simple. As your chariot takes damage your speed is reduced. However, at lower speeds you have more control since you roll more dice. 

One of the clever twists is that you cannot change lanes without rolling a change lane icon on a die. You also need the dice to adjust your speed. All of this means that crashing into others, or careening around a corner at dangerously high speeds can easily happen by accident. This leads to really funny moments in the game where you just have to laugh at your poor plight. 

The game is meant in this spirit of fun. You can try to win but a lot of it is left up to fortuna. The disconnect for me was in the length of a player's turn. Dice can give plus 2 speed at the cost of a damage or +/- 1 speed. This means that you have several possible speeds that need to be considered before executing your move, or paying for a re-roll. This system is far too thinky for the weight of the game. It causes too much downtown.

The other downside is the player elimination, which I wouldn't mind if the game played in 20 minutes. However, the game takes more like 45 minutes, or upwards of an hour with 6 players. On the easy side of the map you won't get eliminated too early, but on the advanced side you can have a streak of bad luck that takes you out quite early.

The atmosphere of the game reminds me a lot of the somewhat obscure Knizia game [thing=3242][/thing] which also has dice rolling and a Roman theme. It's a fun light game that has semi-elimination, you come back as a vicious animal and try to eat your opponents for points. Chariot Race seems like a similar game in spirit but is just a tad too involved for it's own good.

Played this and bashing each other was fun.
Gameplay was okay.
Sadly played this after Mechs vs Minions and this was a quarter of that price.
Componentwise it costs about 20 times too much compared to that one.
the cards to keep track f your chariots won't make it past 20 games....

I Thought about subtracting a point for that.
If you could laminate the chariotcards I could live with it.
Now it feels like a ridiculously "legacy" game that destroys itself.

In retrospect. This is an avoid unless you can laminate.

Circus maximus is way better but does take considerably longer.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

This was an enjoyable romp but is quite a mean game and people need to be aware that death/elimination is quite likely. Of our four, only one person survived and he only survived by one life point. This is set up Yahtzee style with dice drafting except only one re-roll is allowed without spending fortune. The production levels are poor - cardboard cutouts for chariots? Really? These need to be wooden meeples at the least!

Un jeu de course de chars tel qu'il en existe plein d'autres. Il tourne bien, mais n'a beaucoup d'originalité. Pire, la part de gestion ralentit un peu trop les tours de jeux. On est loin de la limpidité de "Ave César", ou "Circus Maximus" (de Knizia), mes références en la matière.

Gioco che mi incuriosiva ma che si è rivelato veramente piatto e banale senza alcun mordente. Si lanciando un determinato numero di dadi, varibile a seconda della velocità, e si svolgono le relative azioni con pochissima libertà sui vari temi. Un gioco che si gioca da solo e in cui poco si può fare. Decisamente bocciato, l'unico pregio è che è uscio da subito con il regolamento anche in italiano.

This is a pleasant game, which is a strange observation for a game with so much violence. The chariot you are driving is falling apart, and it's a challenge just to make it around two laps without getting smeared by the other chariots. It doesn't take very long, either (King of Tokyo is longer).

Got a lot of buzz at Essen. Now there is a KS up and running. It is a pretty simple race game with dice. I was spoiled and played on the special table version of the game with all the big components. I look over and see the actual version and I was a bit disappointed. Only played 3p so I suspect it would be better with more, but perhaps there will be too much down time as I was already feeling the downtime with 3p. Hard to say, but in the end I much prefer [thing=38054][/thing]. It is a game I would play again, but no real desire to seek it out.

It´s a simple Ancient-Rome chariots racing game with nice wooden dices, easy to explain, and fast (no paralysis analysis), in which you´ll try to win the race by making all the possible tricks to your adversaries. It´s good with four or more players. I´m not rating this game with more than a 7  because the materials don´t have good quality at all,  especially the players boards (cards are very thin), although it has an easy (home) fix. I saw this game at a cheap price, and that's why I decided to buy it. For around 15 euros it's worth it, because it's fun and unpretentious.

The mechanics are not bad, but as with many race games, I think starting position is too much of an advantage for those in front.  I do like the violent nature of this chariot racing game - the real possibility of death is great.  Maybe it would be better with 3 rolls like Yahtzee?

RATING: 9
This is a highly interactive game which happens to use the "Roll through the Ages" system. I don't think that system has been used so interactively before, and it works remarkably well - much better than I would have thought possible, in fact!

This is a fast, light, somewhat chaotic chariot game that is a lot of fun. It's what most chariot racing games want to be, but others either get bogged down in fiddliness or don't have enough interesting decisions.  This avoids both those pitfalls - recommended!

I played this last week and was not particularly impressed. For a game about speed, it punishes players very harshly for going around corners quickly. It also has a strong first-mover advantage, as players can drop spikes behind them and you want to avoid ramming other players (most of the time). It wasn't terrible, but I finished the game and was like "Well, I probably never want to play that game again."

For reference, I fell extremely far behind in lap 1, then two players crashed out of the game, so I came in second despite not particularly doing well at all, which was a very odd and not particularly rewarding feeling.

Good things: the first person to finish the race is not always the winner. Other players can finish after them and go farther down the track, or go near them and spear/ram them to death and prevent their victory.

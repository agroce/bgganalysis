Have not played yet, Avalanche Press map artwork is improving.  I love the system, I just wish the map artwork would be totally revised for the system, more along the lines of what they did for Cassino '44.

Acquired Feb 2010 - Good installment of the Panzer Grenadier series.  Lovely maps.  Interesting situations with a variety of victory paths.  Uses the "modern" PG VP points for most scenarios (that I've looked at) which aids in playability and choice.

The maps are gorgeous and, because of so many non-clear terrain, add an element of difficulty as to setting up defenders and choosing lines of approach.

Very cool game in the series. I played a few scenarios already and they all have played out very well. There are some many more I want to play out of this box! A lot to look forward to. The maps and counters are beautiful. I recommend this one.

Panzer Grenadier 3.0 rules are easy to pick up medium complexity. 50 scenarios. I have always liked their counters... leaders, tanks, artillery, paratroopers, infantry and leaders all with nice graphical design. Paper maps are decent. Overall solid tactical game.

Oh, the fall of France, the beginning of a sad chapter in the history of WW2.  They fight with high elan initially but soon it dissipates.  I look forward to play the French side as I love the country every thing France, even the small lightly armored vehicle so vulnerable to the German tank. Gee...the game cost $65!  But it comes with fifty scenarios, eight mapboards, 660 pieces.  A certain addition to the fans of the Panzergranedier series.

AHA, it's here and the maps are tremendous.  

I can't believe how good the French tanks look.  Given their technical superiority the effect of their tactical misery is even more astounding.

Having played a few it seems as though the French problems come from a terrible mix of infantry and a lack of coordination between the infantry and the armored forces.  Much as in White Eagles the Germans overwhelm the defenders with numbers and higher morale.

Beautiful Maps! Nice Counters. Missing Map 30 or I would have given 10

RATING: 5
A decent package.  A good job has been done to evoke the strengths of individual French tanks (or platoons, here) and to model the greater challenges the French experienced in 1940, such as poor deployment and communication.

The scenarios I've sampled have all been interesting as well as challenging, with a nice variety of new units to wage war with.

As usual, though, the scenarios tend to be too long for my taste; things happen too slowly and losses are difficult to inflict.  Using Simple Panzer Grenadier rules improves matters somewhat but it still doesn't feel quite right.

Update: Jettisoned all PG games from the collection as I didn't see myself playing them any longer.  I do not particularly like this scale and there are some far better realized tactical WWII games out there.

Fantastic addition to the PG range: the eight maps are cousins of the Elsenborn maps though of a slightly lighter shade; the germans are the usual bunch of miscreants, though with a few oddities thrown in, such as the SDKFZ Bufla with its 88 mm gun, SD221 armoured cars, and another (rare for the series) 150mm infantry gun.

There are also near two battalions of the Gross Duetchland..er, Deuchland...er, Duechland regiment with more gun power and fancy counters. 

The French are well modelled with lashings of tanks including the Somua, Renault and Char B1 types as well as a full battalion of motorcycle troops. A highly desirable set if you like PG.

Love the whole series, the French are not the push overs that you think. I like the old thinner counters then the new thick ones. will sit down and play this one anytime.

Early WWII armored combat, focuses on the invasion of France. Obviously, adds the French to the PG series.

Amongst my favourite PG titles. Great counters, scenarios and maps. Absolutely nothing wrong with this package (if you like the series). Newer version has laser cut counters so I can not comment on those, but the original version is probably one of APL's most perfect PG releases.

After having played mostly Pacific theater games for some time, it was refreshing to get back to western Europe.  It will take some time to be able to win any of the river crossing scenarios.

RATING: 6.5
A subject area that is really interesting. Beautifully designed maps and exciting scenarios. My only problem is that a lot of the scenarios require changes to the map terrain, in some cases a lot of changes. This tends to put me off. A personal gripe I guess.

RATING: 9
A fantastic module, both from an historical and gameplay point of view.

I love seeing the absolute superiority of many French tanks over these early German designs, some of which would have made passable medium tanks well into the mid-war years.

The game itself has an excellent mix of scenarios, with plenty of armor and mobile troops.  Fantastic set of 8 mapboards by Guy Reissen

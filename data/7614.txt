The only reason I don't give it a 10 is due to the immense complexity. I mean it is a 10, but it's also beyond normal concepts of 'game'. It's a college course. In history and in wargaming. 

Very happy to own this. Enjoyed the game system in its previous, smaller iterations. Playing this is like staging an intricate production. It requires much preparation (copying numerous forms, dedicating a room of the house to it for weeks). It's an annual experience no WWII gamer should miss!

I have not actually summoned the strength or the devotion to play this game, but I have played its antecedents enough to now that this is the finished full expression that everyone has always waited for.  So, with great respect for the decades of play and the great job collating I give this a high score nevertheless.

RATING: 6
An absolute monster in both size and complexity.  I would love to get into a campaign game, but I need to solve the time-space continuum problem first...

Actually, this game must have been designed in the 1920's, long before the actual event.  The fact that the real war failed to make use of all the rules provided in this game is still troubling the designer and playtesters who are feverishly reworking history to make sure that what could have happened is properly recorded to match the rules.  

I think the allies won in 1945, but I am no longer sure - their use of the atom bomb was a little gamey and it really should be curtailed in the rewrite.  This game also does a poor job of simulating the civilian population and provides NO counters for all those people.  A travesty.  We need 30 more countersheets to properly address that.  And rules.  ooooh yes - more rules.

Traded in April 2011.  So long alternate universe...

My poor brain quails in even contemplating this game. I played 3rd Reich ages ago, and it wasn't a terrible game. It's bizarrely ahistorical in a number of ways, from the overwhelming strength of ground air support to the economic system that can only be described as fundamentally arbitrary, but the play value was still decent back then (and I would play "classic" Third Reich again, although I'm certainly not in any hurry to do so).

Why we have built this fun but also still fundamentally flawed game into Advanced Third Reich, and then Rising Sun, and now this World at War monstrosity, is completely beyond me. Like so many AH games, Third Reich's strength was its playability. Later evolutions of the system have completely destroyed any semblance of playability and replaced it with a gargantuan morass of rules, while at the same time retaining all the quirky idiosyncrasies that made it so thematically lousy.

So what you end up with is a game that is neither a playable game nor an interesting take on history; it's just a behemoth.

On a scale of 1-10, my desire to play this game is around -1.

Europe Engulfed is the way to go these days.

When I first read about A World at War, I tought that I found a WWII game of my dreams - computer game Hearts of Iron in my table. Oh boy, how wrong I was...

My friend bought it and we decided to try it in weekend. But when I prepared for the session by reading the rulebook, I started to doubt my decision. Still, decided to give it a try.

After 6+ hour of setup time it was clear that I was right - the game where is no clear rules for setup can't be good. But it felt lame to give up without making a single move. So we went sleep and decided to continue in next day. Another mistake to make.

First Axis turn took about half a day and yes, we skipped supply and oil rules for sake of simplicity! I have to confess that all that constant reading and re-reading the rules was so fatiguing that I fell a sleep next to the table! After waking up, it was time to start with Allied turn. But that was it. Last straw that broke camel's back was to find out that Russia's diplomatic die roll to demand Finnish border areas is actually a sort of a automatic "roll" and Finnish Winer War will broke out by doing so. WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY IT IN A FIRST PLACE, YOU IDIOT WHO WROTE THE RULES?! Why did you have to say such a simple thing through numerous paragraphs and exceptions?!

Disclamer: By no means I'm not a lighthearted euro gamer who accidentally stumbled into heavy wargame and is now dissapointed. I have played Europe Engulfed quite a few times and Asia Engulfed once. One of my favorite games is Here I Stand and I often play wargames previously unknown to me. But this "game" defies description of a game. It is probably an excellent historical simulation but as a game it is totally unplayable without outside help.

GMT Games.  The epitomy of the Third Reich franchise.  This game takes 3rd Reich to the absolute highest level with all the chrome imaginable for this type of game.  A World at War is very complicated, but if 100 or more hours are invested, this game then shines as one of the best MONSTER war games around and the culmination of some 30-40 years in the making!!!  This game is a must have for the Third Reich enthusiast.

RATING: 6
A game for WW2 obsessives who like a high chrome content. The underlying system is rather simple, its Third Reich, but there's enough chrome and economics to fatten this game up to an RPG style inch thick rule book (I am not kidding!). I enjoyed my day of this quite a bit despite not being a strategic WW2 guy and preferred it to the John Prados version of Third Reich. If we were playing them correctly I think the air rules might be a bit off, you can just bleed off ground casualties on the airforce and bring a unit outnumbered by 10 to 1 down to even odds by just hurling in more planes. We managed to hold France through much of 1940 like this. Other than that though the game works pretty well, most of the rules weight is the diplomatic tables and economic system. Not complicated of themselves but it adds up. I'd recommend this to  WW2 nerds with a lot of patience, it'l take time to set up and get into and it feels like a game that escaped the 70s but this will appeal to some.

The worst game in recorded History. They went back in a time machine to the offices of SPI circa 1976 and picked up the same idiot who wrote the most unmemorable rules in SPI-ENGLISH and employed him to create 140+ pages of nonsense, with more examples of exceptions to rules than rules themselves. The effort is language that is deliberately made impossible to deal with in terms of reading.Third Reich 3rd edition( Don Greenwood) is fifty times a better game than this monstrosity. It is a much better thing to have a life than waste time with this. In fact players are rated by well they understand the game, which should indicate something.

I bailed on this system back in the A3R/EotRS days.  Bruce is a nice guy, but what a peculiar obsession.  I have not played AWAW so felt it only fair I not rate it, but A3R & EotRS merited a 1 for reasons that clearly have not been addressed.  My main reason for posting here is to point out that while AWAW is ridiculously complex and has many other problems, there is a clear reason aside from these that unlike its marketing material claims AWAW is no "wargaming masterpiece".  The original designer of Third Reich is a serious scholar.  3R correctly identified one of the Allied powers by the acceptable shorthand Soviet Union.  A3R and AWAW have always incorrectly identified this power as Russia.  Search the living rules - one will not find Soviet Union nor USSR.  *Russia was part of the USSR, and the world has the Red Army of the USSR to thank for defeat of Nazi Germany.*  There is a difference, one that a scholar would emphasize, and anyone who legitimately claimed to be creating a wargaming masterpiece.

I'll quote one of the other comments to start: "I can play ASL without referencing the rules, but I had a hard time learning this game." That goes the same for me. In ASL the rules are long but well thought out and modular. AWAW shows all the signs of being designed by committee. There are exceptions and special cases by the truckload, all requiring constant reference to the rule book. And the rule book has no index, so much page flipping is required.I came away from several months of fighting with this game with two conclusions: first, the only way to really learn this thing is to play with someone who already knows. Second, the game plays better on line. That way you can search the PDF rules for answers and take your time. To me, though, ftf is by far the better experience when gaming. Unfortunately the only play group that I could find was 90 minutes away, even here in overpopulated Southern California.

Well, this game is too much for me. We do not have any place where leave game setup. So we are mostly playing 4-5 hour sessions. Unfortunately this game does not have that many playable scenarios. Also rules are really dense and does not exactly ease starting playing. There are too many exceptions in them so they were really cumbersome.

Also I have just recently acquired Unconditional Surrender and Supreme Commander and will probably rather give swing to them. 

Still I adore all detail which was put into this game and it looks really great I especially like those options to invest into research which is something I was missing in my games.

The definitive WWII Grand Strategy game.  Everything that was wrong with A3R, this game corrects.  Even adds more detail in some of the previously more abstract areas (e.g. naval), making for a more fulfilling WWII experience.  Whatever you thought the historical players should have done, you can probably do in this game.  Be prepared for the steep ASL-like learning curve, however.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A very interesting game.  I do think it may suffer from "rules bloat," though, due to the many rules additions since its genesis with Third Reich.  The additions do add greater depth.  Sometimes it seems like the game can't decide what its proper scale is.  For instance, there are tactical-like naval rules in what ostensibly is a grand strategic scale game.

A WALLET AT WAR.  A 190    page rulebook that doesn't even have page numbers - you think someone thumbing through this bible might want a page reference?  Still pushing paper map sheets.  For $175.00 retail price someone might have been able to scrap up even some thin cardboard backing.  $175.00 does get you 7 PAGES of errata!  Gee, thanks.  Oh, and they give you ONE plastic tray with a cover on it to hold the "Ten full-color Counter Sheets" = 2,800 die cut counters. Plenty of little Baggies though.  The ULTRA cards are a nice touch.  This monster also comes with plenty of booklets, charts and displays.  The Germans and Italians have their fantasy aircraft carriers yet the French don't even get the good old CV Béarn.  This game screams for an eBay sale at around $90.00 to maybe $100.00, any more than this you are paying too much, in my opinion.  Perhaps they factored Bruce Harper's "ego tax" into the $175.00 retail price?

I admire what the designer and developers did here;  this is a tremendous amount of work and in many ways one of the most monumental gaming projects ever completed.  But it is too much;  much too much.  I can play ASL without referencing the rules, but I had a hard time learning this game.  So I give it a 10 for effort and professionalism, but as a game to be played I give it a 1.  It just takes too long to learn, and the likelihood of playing it wrong is too high...too much "upload" for the players before each match.

Arguably the definitive WW2 grand strategy game and a classic.  Finally we have a uniform naval system for the both theatres.  Great support from a dedicated fan base and the Warplanner 2 online platform is a gem.  Steep learning curve and constant rule rejigging (some of which arbitrary but to maintain game balance) are the only negs to a very fine and coherent game system.

24/09/2013: Received my pre-order copy. The first hex-and-counter wargame that I have ever played in my life, so this will be a big jump from my typical diet of euro-gaming.

29/09/2013: Finishing up the Global War Campaign setup for my introductory solo run of the game. Will see how long the first game takes and hope to cut down the time needed in future games!

07/10/2013: Playing through the Winter 1939 Allied turn during my introductory solo run as at this date. This game is rated a 10 because of its ability to interweave everything that was an important consideration during WWII into a single monster game, and where the interplay of all aspects is actually starting to make sense though the ruleset was undeniably intimidating at the start.

I can appreciate the rules that were written to allow players to keep close to the historical developments (e.g. special Pearl Harbour rules, Germany's inability to conduct an offensive on the western front until Winter 1939 etc.), which ensures that the game doesn't go totally out of whack with the reality that it was intended to (partially) simulate.

That I could accept given the scope and depth of such a strategic simulation.What I could not accept was the news of a second edition due to game imbalances 1 year after its release and the $175 I paid for it. What happened to the thousand of mails and years of playtesting?

Kein Spiel, sondern eine Lebensaufgabe. Eigentlich nur für Mönche mit Schweigegelübde geeignet.
Die Spielregeln sind länger und gehaltvoller als manche Dissertation. Geht man auf das Spiel so ein, wie es dies verdient, kann man seine übrigen Spiele verschenken.

AWAW is simply the best grand strategy simulation of the Second World War. You get both Europe and the Pacific in one box. The counters are durable. The maps have good hex size. The rules are well written and kindly supported by an online community. There is a yearly tournament at the World Boardgaming championships  (WBC) which runs all week. Also, there is a prequel called Gathering Storm (1935), and further expansion releases are in development.

AWAW has everything a grand strategy gamer could possibly desire. Rossi says check it out.

I wanted to love this game. I knew I'd probably never get enough people to play it, but wanted to at least play it through once solo. Then started to grasp the setup... Maybe I'm thick in the head, but you shouldn't need to spend hours online trying to find explanations or as a last straw boardgame simulation applications just to get the damn stacks where they're supposed to be.

Thumb down. Hard.

Final(?) iteration of the Third Reich system. A rule book the size of a Chilton manual, and probably takes up more space than all of the tables in your house to play the full game. If you have small children, cats, or just barely enough room to set this thing up, the odds are that you'll never be able to finish a game. Everything about this game is big - I've seen rule books (to Euros) that weren't as long as the sequence of play for one turn.
You know you want it.

One of the most epic gaming experiences I ever had (clearly solitaire). Maybe it's not as good a game, as it is a bit clunkier in my opinion, but I like the look of this better than World in Flames, which makes a big difference to me!

The sequel to "Advanced Third Reich," AWAW has extensive rules, giving it a great deal of "teeth." It's a fun game, and I recommend it but with one warning: the rules are lengthy and can take a large investment of time to learn.

That said, AWAW has a tremendous amount of detail, great components that look sharp on the table, and--being an evolution of AH's "Third Reich"--it gives Third Reich players a comforting familiarity from which they can readily assimilate the new rules. And although AWAW has complexity, and permits you to control so much, it nevertheless clings closer to actual history than most WW2 games that I've played.

I have a strong feeling that I'll never actually play this game, at least not in an opposed play setting. I'll consider it a victory in itself if I just somehow can figure out the rules. This game is an art piece to me more than a source of recreation.

I am curious, as a fan or 3rd R back in the day, this could be a great retirement project. Now owned. There is a danger this could be a solitary obsession as i can't imagine any one I know will want to play it.  Unlike the monster games of my youth (first play was always the full campaign)my ambition is just to get through to play the North Africa scenario and then I'll see what happens.

Read and re-read the sections required to play NA scenario. Need to re-read. It's very difficult not to get diverted by all the exception and special rules.

One of the joys of war game rules reading is the eureka moments when you understand not just how the rule works but also how it abstracts or represents the history - and the Oil and Transport rules have just given me that moment.

A difficulty with reading such a large rule set is taking bits you don't know yet on trust; research, weather, logistics , supply all effect combat results and it is difficult  to resist the temptation to dive off in to the by ways before understanding core principals.

I have followed 3R from the fourth edition on through A3R/RS through downloads from the playtesting of GW2K to this - and the final product really enhances the collective games. The only ting I lack is opponents...

The sense of being in overall command, economically, politically and strategic/operational is what does it for me in this game. And I like the way decisions in economy and research reflects on the battlefield; i.e. that technological changes DO NOT win the war in themselves, but an army, navy, air force is hard pressed indeed, if they do not keep up. At the same time, skillful operational attacks are still the most important parts of the game - say, for instance, GB succeeds in bringing Yugoslavia into their fold - but they are not in a position to support the country on the battlefield, Germany will still vanquish it in a turn or two.

Also I think simplicity vs. complexity for the different combat rules are good. Thus, WWII ground combat is about manoeuvre, hence a fairly simple CRT but lots of thought in positioning or that envelopment, while Air-Naval combat is more micro-managing the task forces and strike groups + a lot of uncontrollable vaiants, hence more complex CRT possibilities and emphasis on search. Naval warfare is, perhaps, still a bit too simplistic but works OK in the overall strategic/operational context - and individual battles are not too long to be able to be fought. The new ULTRA card drawing does add a small level of uncertainty welcome from the older editions, while not unbalancing the basics of warship against warship; thus a lucky draw in itself does not sink the Yamato or Ark Royal. 

Also, I like the research in force pools and the possibilties with production. Although I will experiment wih dividing RP and Production Points for a house rule (not around to doing this, yet).

However, the overall rerason for the high rating is the game's ability to catch my imagination: I have used it to play out a war between GB and US, and the system still worked (although I then did not have enough maps, and most ground combat was in SE Asia which, well...). But the game worked fine and raiding was exhillarating when done by two great sea powers on four different oceans.. A system that can take "tinkering " to this level and survive just has to be good.

Always wanted this. Plan to set it up in my bunker game room in the basement. Plans are on the drawing board for a very nice bunker. Very beautiful game. Nice tip for owners of this game or any other for that matter. Two gallon zip lock bags, cut and seal one edge then place in book, melt the cut edge together. Give yourself a little extra room for sliding the game in and out of course. A 2 gallon zip lock bag works perfect for this one. a 2 gallon bag also fits the SPI flat tray perfect, also the thin Avalon Hill games. For $2.50 for 10 bags to protect your valuable games, it just seems silly not to have them protect in such a simple easy way. Save those games. No more shelf wear. All my games are protected like that! So gentleman for twenty five cents per bag, there is absolutely no excuse for shelf wear. Da!

Preliminary rating to account for the silliness of the constant rules rewrite. It doesn't help play and is just plain stupid. I have bits and pieces of three rulebooks iterations (there is no definitive one, as the game is in eternal designing process) and just going through the first turn is a nightmare.

Updated rating after more play and more experience with the system. The rules are bad, but the game seems good!

And updating again as, little by little, I discover the terrible whirlpool of brokenness  this game is. Has it even been playtested... at  least once?

RATING: 4
A giant rulebook with lots of special cases is never a great start. But what bugs me is that the designer and core players keep tweaking the rules - by the end of a six-month cycle, the online rules are often quite different than the cutting-edge. This problem is only made worse by the fact that scenario cards and other materials are updated even less. I think this would be a great game if it's *all* you play and you play every week, but you can't get anything out of it more casually.

Good simulation in the open campaign (Research, diplomacy, mobilizations, ...).
The Pacific scenario is not balanced (playing only Pacific theater) because is too hard for Japan a historical expansion in early war phase. In the historical Pacific scenario it is still more hard.
The wargame is very complex but however is very scripted in its actions (Polands always is conquested in the fist turn, Russia never is invaded in 1940, Britain is never conquested, USA never is neutral until 1944, etc...), and a little pro-allied (more in Pacific that in Europe). Playing with Allies you have very much options to win if you play correctly without mistakes and without very bad luck.

Less good simulation in the historical campaigns scenarios. To play the historical scenarios is better other heavy wargames (like AETO). 

The best point of AWAW are the "what if" of non-militar type (research, political, intelligence and economic). And  this may be still improved with the Gathering Storm add-on.

However, in general terms, AWAW has disappointed to me in some details. I come from A3R/ERS, and I think that AWAW could have been better wargame (surely the best WWII strategic wargame), but AWAW has failed in this target. I wished vote this wargame with a 10, but my qualification will be 8.

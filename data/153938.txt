Bom jogo, mas sofre do mesmo mal dos outros jogos de corrida que já joguei: é muito simples! Como maiores qualidades: o número máximo de jogadores é alto; o objetivo (ganhar dinheiro e não ganhar a corrida), baixo tempo de espera entre as jogadas e o visual do jogo, que é muito legal! Funciona bem como jogo de entrada, mas não tem nenhuma profundidade estratégica.

Nice and fun filler game.
Influence on the outcome of the race is hardly existent, it's all about making the right bets at the right time.

Reminds me of Long Shot. Camnel up looks a nicer, is more streamlined and is certainly much better balanced. Emotional involvement is a littler smaller though, as you can't own the camels and several people will usually get points for one camels win in a stage.

OVERALL: It's a silly filler game. The tiles add just enough chaos and can change the odds a little if used properly. I'll play it when asked.

RATING: 7
First play was very anticlimactic with one camel way ahead.  Becuase of this, the game lacked any tension or excitement.  I'm hoping this isn't the case very often, becuase this could be a very fun game if it's close at the end.

Upped to a 7 after the second play.  The race was close and had a couple of I can't believe that camel ended up in front moments.  

Upped to an 8 after 3rd and 4th plays.  Fun, light and likely to produce great surprise moments.

Settled on a 7 after a few more plays.  When crazy surprises happen it's great, if not it's a little dull.  Crazy surprises seem to happen about half the time in my games.

Quite enjoyable betting game with nice looks. Simple rules but still offers some interesting speculation over which camel is going to win. I am happy to play with adults and kids alike anytime. However, does not have that extra something to justify a higher rating which are reserved for games that you keep analysing long after the game has finished.

Camel up. Or, as I like to call it, the middle eastern OTB, is a surprisingly good play. I wanted to dismiss this game when I heard it beat Splendor for the spiel. At the time I remember thinking, "I need to at least try it to see why a racing game would beat splendor". So yeah, Splendor. Anyways, what I found out was that Camel Up is a fantastic game that has nothing to do with racing. I mean, there is a race going on and the camel meeples do race around the board but the game is actually a betting game. You spend the entire game making short term "leg" bets, long term race outcome bets, manipulating the track to alter the outcome of a particular leg, and eventually making a pyramid poop out a die to share information that will make the next players choices slightly more informed. Don't let the race cover or the apparent camel on camel porn dissuade you from trying this out because it is fast, fun, and scales very nicely up to 8 players. Splendor? Who cares about Splendor? I need to place a bet on Mossy humps to go all the way! Yip yip!

A different kind of racing game.  You never make any decision about what camel is moved, but you need to see each one's next several moves in order to "bet" properly.  And the whole game is about betting.  Good length, good components.  Scales up to 8, but I'm not sure how well.

Only played once, but wow...what a fun little game. Didn't think I'd like it that much since you need 4+ people to make it interesting (more people usually slogs a game down) but not with this, decisions are quick and the game is the perfect length so it never feels rushed or like it's over stayed.

RATING: 8
I heard of Camel Up for the first time directly when it was nominated for the Spiel des Jahres. So I was really curious, because nobody was talking about this game at the time! I looked it up and what I saw was a weird chaotic game... that seemed completely impossible to control and I really couldn't understand the choice of the committee. So I just stopped caring about it, even when it won the prize. Many months later it casually happened that I had the opportunity to play it. Now I understand why the committee made that choice and I've to say, that they absolutely made the right call!

It's true that the game is light and chaotic, but the SdJ is a family oriented prize and this game is just perfect for that crowd! Camel Up shouldn't be approached as a game in which you have to build strategies, count your moves or your chances. It's about pushing your luck, making crazy bets and having some silly fun with a bunch of people... and the game works great for all of that. The components are really cool too and especially the pyramid, which may look weird but it definitively makes the game unique and more fun.

Overall a silly game with a silly theme, that just works and does exactly what it should do. It delivers laughter, excitement, a great social experience and it works really well with families and casual players.  I've never seen a group cheering, shouting and laughing playing Splendor... but I've seen that happening when they were playing Camel Up. That is the seal of the better family game, no matter how much better Splendor is selling. Don't skip this one just due to its randomness, because I liked a lot more than I thought I would have.

RATING: 7
Short and easy game. More interesting than I thought after reading the rules. The pyramid and colorful board can make the game attractive to non gamers. I would not mind to own it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Camels are running around a pyramid. This is a betting game, just as in real life horseracing. You either move the camel or bet on it. You can also influence the outcome a little bit by placing obstacles, but overall the luck is what counts. Perfect for the younger generations, but a little bit too fidly for the gamer one's.

:what: :) :) :D :D :) :yuk: :yuk: After one play: nothing special, nothing horrible. A cute medium length filler, but it doesn't really have that deep strategy I like because of the randomness of the race. I won my first game just by betting conservatively, grabbing certain points, and never taking a -1 penalty, unlike everyone else. Also I nailed the first prediction of Loser for +8, while half the table guessed the wrong winner.

RATING: 6
Das Spiel ist ein eher chaotisches Kamelrennen. Zu planen gibt es wenig bis gar nichts. Konkreten Einfluss auf den Rennverlauf hat man kaum. Der Schwerpunkt liegt darin abzuschätzen, wie die jeweilige Etappe und das gesamte Rennen wohl ausgehen könnten. Dabei führen sowohl der Würfelmechanismus als solcher als auch der Zugmechanismus dazu, dass eine einigermaßen verlässliche Voraussage nur in seltenen Spielsituationen möglich ist. Durchaus nett, wenn es gespielt wird als schnelle, lustige Zockerei. Grübeln ist da sinnlos, tötet nur den Spielspaß. Merkwürdig, dass zweimal hintereinander Zockerspiele Spiel des Jahres geworden sind, wobei "Spiel des Jahres" aktuell per definitionem ein Familienspiel mit einfachem Einstieg, leicht verständlichen Regeln und geringem Schwierigkeitsgrad ist. Das war nicht immer so, sonst hätten Spiele wie Catan und El Grande vor rund 20 Jahren nicht Spiel des Jahres werden können; heutzutage könnten solche Spiele bestenfalls noch Kennerspiel des Jahres werden oder fielen komplett aus der Wertung für diese Preise raus; solchen Spielen könnte allenfalls noch der Deutsche Spielepreis winken, wenn sie denn dafür bekannt genug sind.

RATING: 4
Look, I'm not some joyless bean-counting efficiency gamer.  I can enjoy a thirty minute romp that is high on the luck scale.  While I am assuredly not the target market for Camel Up, I might have had fun.  It does have the neat mechanism of camels hitching a ride on other camels to raise it above straightforward roll and move.  It does have the gimmick of the pyramid dice shaker. Yet it fell very flat with me.  I think that's because, rather than letting me relax and enjoy some dumb fun, it invites me to think like a gamer, assessing options for my turn and calculating odds...before it kicks me in the nuts with pure blind luck. 

Production quality is very good; the pyramid seems durable and the camels are chunky and stack well.  The artwork made little impression, either positive or negative.

RATING: 5
A simple betting game suitable for families nad casual gamers. Rules are quite easy to teach and learn. Components are nice but the dice pyramid is just a gimmick and it doesnt work properly most of the time. 

In the end the game is too luck dependant and everything can happen. This is nice for a family game because it can create some memorable moments where one camel goes from the last place all the way to the first place. But the truth is that its so random that it also makes the bidding part pointless.

Dumbest, most luck-based filler ever. I usually loathe those kinds of games, but this one is cute enough and simulates the drive of gambling well enough that it gets a pass from me :p Best for situations when you just want to shut down your brain and just push your luck.

+ At first play the game seemed too random, but after several plays you begin to have a better sense to the randomness
+ Better with more players
+ A good family game that can take up to 8 players
- Usually it's easier to pick out the loser camel, so it's easy 8 points for the first one to take a guess
- If you desire for a better control of the randomness, Ribbit is probably a better choice

Clever, colored dice driven race game with camels that stack up on each other's backs, and in some cases, travel together.  The trick is to determine when to bet on certain colors winning legs of the race, and ultimately, winning the entire race.  I find this game to be clever, but not particularly compelling or fun beyond learning how to react to dice rolls.  Curiously, I feel I should like this game more than I do.  Perhaps on future plays, it will improve.

Camel up es un party game y filler muy entretenido para pasar un rato con gente no jugona o para rellenar 20 minutos, realmente da la sensación de apuestas en una carrera que todo puede pasar, ya que el hecho que los camellos se monten si quedan en la misma casilla genera muchas situaciones posibles.

Realmente cumple su función, con una muy buena estética.

Su mejor rendimiento está entre 4 y 6 jugadores.

I have a great time with this game.  I like the randomness of this game.  When you think you figured out what camel is going to finish first/last, craziness happens and the another camel comes out on top.  The kids have a terrible poker face.  They scream and yell for the camel they have picked to win and are constantly cheering for the one that they picked for last place.  We tend to trade friendly jabs with each other and use the mirage tokens more than most people probably play with.  This is another one of the games we pull out often.

Initial rating, based on playing once. Absolutely lovely components (even if I suspect their longevity to be limited, mostly due to the rubber band for the pyramid), with a wacky theme and mechanics. Captures the betting concept quite well. Ultimately there's very little game here, though, with a scarily large luck-factor.

Normally, this isn't my type of game; it is mechanically light and hinges on the randomness of dice. But overall, I found this game to be quite enjoyable. Part of the reason is that it doesn't overstay its welcome (20-30mins per game). But the other reason is the randomness is well controlled and the game provides some interesting decisions beyond mere probabilities. In the end, it manages to be a tense filler with some depth to explore.

I don't want to overstate the decisions and/or understate the influence of the randomness. But for something so simple, quick, and accessible to different player counts... it's a game I'll keep in my collection for some time.

Camel Up is a great game to bring out at family get togethers. Very easy to teach and when you get a few player invested in the different camels it becomes a ton of fun.

Fun with children, but...
If you play early in a leg then it seems invariably best to play a desert/oasis tile in the immediate path of the camels. If you play late and several camels have moved then it is time to risk a wager. Either way, there's not much interesting decision making going on, your choices being largely determined by turn order.

Taken as what it really is, a really good game.  Don't look for great strategy, this is a betting game with a lot of luck involved, but it is just really fun.

A family targeted racing and betting game. Five camels race on a circular track, and players place bets on the winner of each leg, and overall winner and loser.

The game is very light, and I see it can hardly work with strategic players (the first turns of each leg there is little information available, so the best move is draw a die from the pyramid, but after 2-3 dice have been drawn, the next one will give away too much, so everyone tries to avoid drawing…), but with the casual/family gamers is a sure hit, and after playing it more than 10 times in a week during a holiday with casual gamers, I admit it deserved the Spiel des Jahres!

I gave away my copy as a gift after that holiday, and now I will probably get another...

Kamelen racen rondom de piramide.  In elke etappe kan je op hen gokken, ze tegenhouden of vooruit duwen, enz...
Grappige figuurtjes die ook op elkaar gestapeld kunnen worden en dus ook samen bewegen.
De piramide bevat de dobbelstenen: Kinderen vinden het leuk die dobbelstenen eruit te duwen.

Veel elementen, en toch eenvoudig genoeg.
Ook fijn en spannend voor grotere groepen wegens genoeg interactie.
Te eenvoudig voor enkel volwassenen evenwel.

Te kopen vanaf dat Himaya 8 is.  Nu is ze nog te jong om het begrip "gokken" te begrijpen.  En... go!

It's easy to see why this game scooped the Spiel des Jahres - the whole family was instantly hooked.

You play a member of Egyptian high society betting on a camel race.  Each turn you can do one of four things - move a camel, bet on a camel to win a leg (a leg is a segment of the race completed when all 5 camels have moved), place your oasis/mirage tile to boost/reduce the movement of any camel that lands on it or bet on the eventual winner or last place finisher in the race. 

Camels are moved using a cardboard pyramid which contains the 5 coloured dice (one for each camel). You give it shake, turn it upside down and then push a little cardboard door open to release a die onto the board.

The winner is the person with the most money at the end of race.  Money is awarded at the end of each leg, and once one of the camels has crossed the finish line.

The fun is that the race is so unpredictable. That's because any camel that lands on the same space as another camel hops on top of it and moves with it when it moves. So a camel can be well behind the leader, get a couple of piggybacks and move into contention. We've had more than a couple of 5 camels stacks, and one instance of a camel I'd bet on to to finish last coming first.

Each turn you have interesting decisions.  If you use your action to move a camel, you'll have more of an idea who'll win the leg but your opponents will be able to bet on the leg winner before you have a chance (only 3 people can bet on a single camel to win a leg). If you bet early in the leg, before most of the camels have moved, the rewards are potentially greater but you've got less chance of picking the leg winner.

It strikes a great balance between luck and strategy, which makes the game a great good leveller between kids and their smart arse parents.

My only complaint would be the dice pyramid. Its a great little device, and the kids love it, but I broke my first rubber band in game 2. I have 2 spares (well, 1 now) but the rate of attrition doesn't bode well.

For the kids, it would also be great to have names and profiles for the 'betters' - and perhaps unique abilities - it just adds another dimension to the game.

On the flipside, the components are very high quality and the game is very well priced.

All in all a great game for a family or a group of friends. You'll find yourself wanting to play again as soon as you've finished.

I see why this game won the award. It's quick, light and lots of fun. Components are pretty good too including a gimmicky-but-cool pyramid you use to roll the dice. It could have easily been a bag where you pull dice but they went the extra step here. There's a high amount of luck but there's still enough solid decision-making that a better player will usually win. Still, that camel you thought was last the whole game may jump ahead and mess up your whole plan!

Camel Up is a combined race and betting game.  I love the way you almost play a game of chicken with everyone else, hoping they will be the one to roll the dice so that you can be the one to make the more accurate bets.  The way the camels move is brilliant, and makes it so there can be dramatic swings in where they are placing each round.  Even when it seems obvious who will win and who will come in last, there is always a chance that a certain die roll will change everything.  The strategy seems a bit elusive for some people, because they don't grasp how and when to make bets (in fact I've yet to be beaten because apparently I get it more than anyone else in my family.)  It's easy to teach but hard to get everyone competitive, which might hold back some people from giving it a chance.  Not the best SdJ winner, but certainly far from the worst.  And that pyramid for rolling the dice is a lot of fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A fun quirky game about camels racing with a thematical pyramid spitting out the camel's dice which dictates their movement. The trick is trying to guess who the winners and losers will be while the camels play piggy-back with each other on their way to the finish line.

 It plays up to eight and it plays rather quickly so it has a place in my collection for the once in a blue moon eight player quick game that may induce some funny moments and laughs. Group dependent and your mileage may vary. Not taking it too seriously and playing for fun is where it's at.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The optimal move in Camel Up can be easily math-ed out, but where's the fun in that? To maybe do better than everyone else you must do something outlandish! Let the wooden cameeples and absurd die rolling pyramid cloud your thoughts and bet early and often. You'll stand and cheer as somehow something unexpected happens.

This is a game that, for us, requires more players than 3. It allows for a tighter bidding which means a tighter luck aspect. Less people relaxes the bidding mechanic and allows the 3 players to take every bid to balance out the losing ones. Overall, though, this game is absolutely fun! (side not---- replace the crappy plastic/rubber bands with good ol' fashioned medium sized rubber bands. I used 2 of them on the pyramid and it holds together all the same.)

RATING: 8
Camels race through the sahara, stacking as necessary, as changing bets and a fun dice-pyramid gimmick give this game a fun thematic feel. Simple mechanisms allow this game to be almost gateway, or at least an easy next step game. The stacking mechanism of the camels adds the interesting potential for the camel in last to hitch a ride and end up in first for the next round. 

Overall lighthearted and not overly strategic, this game is still a go to for friends and family. Also plays well with a wide range of player counts (4-8 in my opinion).

Camel Up is nothing more than one fun silly filler of luck and chance: what makes it such a good game is, there’s little strategy when playing it apart from guessing which camel still has the better chances at placing ahead of the others. Yet this is what does the trick with the game, as it leaves plenty of space for cheers and light-hearted chatter.

When we play it our recurring joke is, German games fear dice and randomness so much they don’t even dare to touch them but prefer to use an unpractical (but slightly themed at least) pyramid-shaped tumbler to roll them. But don’t be afraid, dice are mostly harmless! [i](July 2014)[/i]

A worthy Spiel des Jahres winner, as it appeals to a broad audience. It's simple enough for families, and is still fun for gamers. In other words, it's a game you can play with your non-gaming friends and not get sick of it when they want to play it over and over.

Shares a genre with Royal Turf / Winner's Circle: racing and betting. If you're familiar with that game, it's like that, except you have much less control over the movement of the racers, but in this one you can make smaller bets during the race, instead of just at the beginning.

I can't decide which I like more -- Royal Turf is painful with a full six-player count and much better with fewer. I like that Camel (C)Up can plays well with large groups. So if I had to pick one game, I'd probably keep Camel (C)Up. I love Royal Turf but there are so many other great games I could play if there are three or four players, and Camel (C)up is the better game for more players.

I've played with 3, 6 and 7 players, all different groups. In two of the games, one player moved the camels significantly more often than other players, and the winner (by a good-size margin) was the player to his or her left. This is because she could pick a bet first after new information was revealed. A potentially serious problem that I'll reconsider after more plays.

But it is a lot of fun. It has visual appeal, is enjoyable by many different types of people, and works well over a large player range. And unlike a lot of games these days, it has real tension and potential for cheers and groans. It's a perfect choice for SdJ.

It's obviously meant to be Camel Cup. I don't care what the back of the box says, the title graphic is clearly intended to convey "Camel Cup" (not nearly as ambiguously as people suggest). Annoys me that they print one thing and claim (retroactively?) it's meant to be something else.

I have played this with a small group and a large group and I think a smaller group works better, then rolling the die doesn't become a punishment, as in not making a move to earn serious money and just rolling on your turn for a dollar. less players = more turns.

Box says up to 8-players, but I don't see it. Maybe up to 6. Because, if my friends are any indication, a race leg could easily be over before the 7th and 8th players could even get to do anything that round. (They love to advance those camels! Grrr!)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
When I first played this game, I loved it! The crazy madness around the odds of every single turn is hilarious.

We're betting on camels on a race where we can, in some degree, influence some events during the race. The mechanism around the last jumps to the top of the stack makes it very hard to predict who's gonna end first on the turn, even tougher to predict who's gonna win the race.

But let's be honest, we (almost) don't have any control of anything that happens in the game. That is fun! Really, it's a fun game, because we never know how things will turn out... I've played games of Camel Up where the last positioned camel on the last turn... wins the race! How can you expect that? The thing is... not to expect anything. Just have fun and laugh! 

Now that I've played it so many times, I don't love it. I don't know if I still like or not. I'll keep it as a 7, but this the type of game (now) where I get pissed off more often than I enjoy it. The luck plays such a major part in this game that it drains the fun of it. What used to be fun, now gets me mad.

All in all, it's a good game. It lasted in my good graces for long time. Now I can't even play it. I'll stick with the memories! ;)

Very fast game that we always play more than once.  It is a fun, light, easy, family game that plays up to eight.  Though I have never played with more than 5.  Everyone enjoys this, and you can almost never just count a camel out of this race.  Lots of fun and cheering for or against certain camels.

Fast betting race game - more a filler than anything else (as it's pretty random). Downside is the damn annoying dice pyramid, bin it and use a bag, easier quicker (but less pretty).

Was expecting more 'fun' than the game provided - royal turf this isn't ...

Juego de apuestas caótico, de carreras de camellos. En casa turno, el jugador puede coger una loseta de apuesta, sacar un dado (que hará avanzar a un camello y los que tengan encima), colocar una loseta de oasis/espejismo, o apostar por el final de la carrera. Está curioso, porque el orden en que avanzan los camellos (que pueden ir apilados) es muy caótico. Es simpático el juego y apto para todo tipo de públicos. Se juega rápido. Además, tiene una pirámide de donde se sacan los dados de avance de camellos que es de lo más llamativa.

Fun first play. Only played 2-player, and we didn't use the oasis tiles as it was a lot to get on the first go for my 6-year old. She wasn't crazy about the game, but I think it will be fun with a couple more players and perhaps more fun in 6-12 months for her.

Initally very surprised at how much fun I had playing this game - and surprised at how much fun I've had with the game at a table full of adults too. The game creates a genuinely exciting atmosphere and always generates a lot of laughter and friendly indignation. It's not a particularly deep game strategically, but it's certainly a fantastically executed roll-and-move game - never devolves into a frustrating experience for players who continually get "bad rolls" as their bad luck can be mitigated (or hilariously exacerbated) by the bets they place. Roll-and-move done right and always good fun - only rated 7/10 as, despite how well I think the game is exectued,  I do have to be in the right mood to play games like this.

Racing and betting game where players can choose to roll dice, place bets or put down tiles in hopes of having the camels they bet on win the leg (which ends after each camel rolls the die ones) or the race (when one camel crosses the finish line.)

Recognizable because of the stacking camels; camels that land on another will pile up, the topmost camel is the one in the lead--and camels that move will carry those that are on top along for the ride.

A decently fun betting/wagering game, where you bet on the outcome of a camel race.

The novelty here is a pyramid which dispenses the dice.  The order in which the dice come out highly affects the outcome of each stage of the race, so while you can play the odds, your bets will get shot in the foot very often.

I didn't love it, and I didn't hate it.  Not a game I'd suggest playing, but if someone else wants to play, I wouldn't refuse.

Feels like another version of Manila. Your control in the game is how you bet, not how the racers perform. The tension is on when you bet, the earlier you bet, the greater the reward, but the greater the likelihood of being wrong. So you want to bet just before everyone else does, but if you wait too long the gamble is a sure thing and everyone else has already placed their bets and you get nothing.

It's also a game that feels silly, so no one looks at you funny when you call out stuff like, Go Green Go!

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a terrific little betting/racing filler/family game. I love that the camels start in different spots at the beginning of the race and for each leg, and of course that they stack - this creates different positions and unique betting situations each round. 

I also think the game creates fun tension between the short-term and long-term betting, and invites risk-taking with the payout structures. Another key to the game working are the +1/-1 tiles you can use to subtly influence the outcome of the race. Whenever you make a bet, you have to consider how following players can screw you with the tiles. It adds a good deal of richness to the betting. 

It's just a lot of little details that make for a fresh-feeling, fun game. Everything sets up and plays in 20-30 minutes - very nice game. A worthy winner for game of the year.

How the movement works with the camels stacking, the dice pyramid, and the betting over each leg and the entire race make this an excellent light game to either start or end a gaming session. I think they got it right making this SdJ as it will really attract families to the table. I've already picked it up since I played it, can't wait to get it to the table again.

This should be a fun game for children, especially with the greatly overproduced components (like the dice pyramid that doesn't do anything a simple cloth bag wouldn't have done). Gameplay is very simple: You bet on a camel and then random stuff happens and someone wins money. (This is for the eggertspiele / Pegasus Spiele German edition (2014).)

Got a chance to play this at Geekway where it was a pretty big hit with everyone I played with.  Love the Russelbande mechanic with the stacking camels which can lead to some dramatic shifts in fortune as the end of the race nears.  Simple rules, plays quickly - easy to see why this won the SdJ.

Die Rüsselbande with a bit more bite... betting even. Not an altogether unpleasant game; probably great for somewhat older children. For serious gaming too limited because there is little one can do to influence individual camels. It would probably make the game too difficult anyway. The pyramid is very, very gimmicky and could easily have been left out, but it is probably a hoot with the lil' ones... who proceed to tear it to pieces at the earliest convenience when the adults aren't looking. I find it difficult to rate this title, and so for the moment will leave it unrated.

[b]Update[/b] SdJ 2014?? This? What was the jury thinking? (And yes, I'm well aware of the fact that the SdJ is not the KdJ, nor the DSP!) There is no game worth speaking of here!

RATING: 5
Uninspiring betting game that is probably good for families however the 'probability calculations' won't appeal to youngsters (or adults for that matter). Turn order is critical and ruins the game by unbalancing it. Roll a die instead to decide the winner but for goodness sake don't use the awful pyramid thing!

Brilliant game. Brilliant design. Very random but this suits the theme of betting on camel races. Almost a party game - but not quite. There is surprising depth to the strategy and tactics.

I think this game proves that having one or two clever mechanisms can really elevate a game that otherwise would feel like "been there, done that." Such is the case with last year's SdJ winner.

The pyramid represents a twist on the classic dice tower, and knowing that by choosing to roll you are giving valuable information to other players is truly agonizing. Add to that the uncertainty of when to place bets on the winner and the loser to maximize your take in the long game, and you see that Camel Up offers real choices and isn't totally random.

I liked this game but I didn't love it - it's the kind of game where I'd happily play if asked, but I doubt I'd request it. It also solidified my thought that Splendor should have won the SdJ!

Technically, I never owned this game, but I wanted to add to to my list so I remind myself not to buy it.  

Here's what's awesome:  The game looks excellent, the idea of stacking camels and planning ahead is cool, the pyramid with the dice mechanism is fun.  

Here's the problem with this game:  It makes you feel like you have some strategy to control it, but really, all that matters is the last 10 spaces.  The whole early part of the of the game is wasted time and energy.   I kept yearning to have more control to effect the outcome, but it wasn't there.  Also, it hurt my head a little.  A little more brain power was needed than I wanted to to give.  

If pushed, I will try playing it again.  Maybe with practice I can iron out my concerns.

Don't remember much of it. I remember once playing a game with a peculiar movement of animals. Those were elephants if I remember correct. I was charmed by that elephant game and therefore I thought maybe this one will be great too. And although it has a few similar features, the game fell flat almost immediately in my experience. It's almost unpredicable and all the time I kept wondering how such a game could become a Game of the Year. Sigh! So many better games coming out each year.

It looks cool, and I like the way the camels move, but I didn't see any room for meaningful decision making.  You bet on random camels and randomly someone wins.

RATING: 10
Handling up to 8 (10 with the expansion), this is my go-to pick for large groups of casual or mixed gamers. With only 4 available actions, it's easy to explain and plays quickly, even with a full table. The actions offer a nice balance between surety and uncertainty, leading to some interesting choices and rewarding outcomes. The wacky movement of the camels almost always engenders favorites and underdogs, leading players to cheer when "their" camel makes an unexpected move or groan as a pack leader inexplicably finishes a leg in last place. This game has generated more group cheering and stand-up die rolls than any other in my collection. 

My most-played game at the Gathering of Friends 2014.

Still fun with the right people, good intro game, but looses its luster quickly.

[July 2015 - 7.4]
I might have rated Camel Up a little higher after my first play or two, but after some more plays, there are some issues -- mainly dependent on who you play with. 

It's a great family/party game and easy to learn, but I almost find playing with gamers more enjoyable. 

The key for more fun, in my opinion, is having people place bets earlier rather than later. This leads to more investment and emotion, as you pull for, and try to change the outcome (with the +1/-1 tiles). Otherwise (and this is what I find with some newer players) people just play it safe and just roll and roll. When this happens, the game turns into one of more complete luck dependent of where you are in the turn order -- there's really no time for any sort of strategy or fun.

Still, play with the right people, make some crazy bets and this can be a rousing good time. I love to see the last-place camel come back for the win.

Very fun game with great components (well maybe except the money). The pyramid mechanic for the die is clever and makes you just wanna trigger it!  A simple rule, makes this game so unpredictable and fun: the one that makes one camel to sit on top of the other when they meet in the same square. 
The game starts quietly, but the tension grows as  camels are getting closer to the finish. Friends, kids and relatives always enjoy it, as long as more experienced gamers, as a funny filler.

Players are trying to make money by speculating on the result of a camel race around a pyramid.  Sort of a throwback game that feels like an oldie.  It's sort of fun, but awfully chaotic, and probably a little over engineered for the type of game it's trying to be.  It also seems to play itself - if you get an early turn in a "leg", you place your oasis chip down ... stuff like that.  It's almost impossible to predict - so a lot of speculative luck is involved in this one.  Turf Horse Racing / Royal Turf did this stuff so much better 20 years ago.

Light-hearted family-weight racing game that doesn't wear out its welcome.   It's sort of like a simplified hybrid of Winner's Circle and Russelbande.  The presentation is excellent.   There's a bare minimum of control or meaningful choice.   The movement system allows for camels in the back to catch up if the dice come out of the pyramid in the right order.   That's the most interesting element to keep track of.   Plays a large group well, and there are a lot of swing-y moments which make the game fun if played in the right mindset.  Can be played in 20-30 minutes.

Spot-on racing/bidding game. A little light to be a group-favorite, but I've never had a bad game. Camel-stacking shakes up movement mechanics so much, everyone enjoys the pyramid (gimmick? shush, it's awesome,) and the end reveal for 'race winner' and 'race loser' are exciting - everyone loves when an extremely early call either turns out spot-on or super wrong.

[b][FirstImpressionOn21stJuly2014][/b] Hit all my expectations. This is a game that I knew I have to own. The fact that it can be played with 8 is a huge bonus but I can sense that you'll lose plenty of controls and variables with that player count.

With 5, it's brilliant. Most of the time, I stood up to portray my enjoyment of the game. It really was fun and my inner child kept shouting for that camel colour. The fact that the camels stack up adds the unpredictability and that plays a major role in your decision. In other words, it's tonnes of fun!

Great for what it wants to be - a betting game with tons of luck and high emotions. 7 or 8 players are too much IMO - there is too much additional luck then what is left for you to do, when late in player position. I would like it een more, when the characters would not be "british colony" and "desert sheiks" style stereotypes.

RATING: 8
How excellent is this game?  Truly. It's an apparently simple betting and race game which has a number of twists and turns in the options and the strategies.   It offers a rare old combination of the edge-of-your-seat excitement of the race with enough going on to offer decisions on every turn. You can move camels, bet on camels to win a race-leg, bet on camels to win or lose the overall race or play movement modifiers onto the track.   And it scales to eight.

Another great filler which can turn into longer game with more players, especially with those eager to play notorious -1 mirage tile which slows down the race a little bit. Unexpectedly fun, push your luck, race betting game with cool desert theme and awesome pyramid dice roller.

The movement mechanics are unique and fun to adapt to, and lead to very swingy gameplay, which in a betting game is great. However, anyone with an understanding of probability will simply take actions with the highest expected value, and sit back and see how the game pans out. And due to the limited actions and scoring methods in the game, determining the optimal move is very easy. This is much more of a show than a game, but its a decent show.

Pros
--Offers those "Oh my gosh, that just happened!  What were the odds!?" moments.
--Great for kids and adults to play together
--Scratches the gambling itch

Cons
--Smart playing can only get you so far, but, it's gambling.....

Overall, why on Earth did I buy this?  It was all right fun, but, I've learned a lot from making bad game purchases such as this.  Don't get me wrong, this isn't a BAD game, just, very niche.

A blast of a board game.  Betting on the camels is such fun, the money count at the end becomes of little importance as seeing your camel do what you were betting it would do.

2014 Spiel des Jahres Winner.  Light family style game, plays quickly, easy to learn, and fun.  

Played a four-player game twice.  Can be very volatile with positions changing quickly, which makes it hard to bet correctly, but also keeps it fun.  Feels somewhat random, but less so than some think.  Timing of bets is important, and seizing opportunities to bet when you think a camel is likely to win - this is the heart of the game (not trying to make a particular camel win, which is nearly impossible!).  Realize that taking pyramid action does often help your opponents by giving them more info.

Great comment from deedob [url=https://www.boardgamegeek.com/listitem/4143416?commentid=5754624#comment5754624]here[/url]:
[q]A very misunderstood game.

I found that there are two type of players for Camel (C)up:
1) Those that bet early and hope for the best while avoiding the pyramid action since it "gives your opponent information you don't benefit from".
2) Those that wait and try to time their actions to make bets with the most possible returns for their actions and are not afraid to take the pyramid action once in a while.

Players of type 1 always think this game is all "random and no strategy" and ultimately don't think this game is fun.
Players of type 2 thinks there's much more than luck involved and have a great time.

However, players of type 2 tend to win the game almost all the time, thus proving that the "no strategy and all random" part is completely wrong.[/q]

lacxox adds:
[q]this game is not about influencing the outcome of the race (hey, when can you influence real races you made real bets on anyway?) but on betting and grabbng the best opportunities at the best time.[/q]

Diversión asegurada, la aleatoriedad de movimiento de los camellos en su carrera por llegar a la meta, da pie a oportunidades de jugadas específicas para influenciar el resultado. Ciertamente el orden de turno y la suerte son factores muy importantes a tomar en cuenta. Al final es un juego casual, que permite hasta 10 jugadores en una partida (con expansión).

After one play, I think there is a little room for me to improve my play. I do not expect to find too much depth, though, because of the player's lack of control of the camels. The experience of watching the camels get rolls you want or rolls you don't does provide a small thrill to me, though.

This game works, but is a bit clunky and is not at all compelling, though there certainly are decisions that affect your chance of winning.  It is a real game, but I felt I was going though the motions.

I'm quite picky about race games, even though there are a few that I love.  If a race game has too much planning, or if it has too much chaos, I probably won't like it.  This has too much chaos.

A fun game, but you feel like you have no control at all the first time you play. It get slightly better the second time you play, though. You must just take it for what it is, and it works for that purpose. The components are just awesome. I would say this is the one of the four weakest Spiel des Jahres-winner for the last 20 years. A very important aspect about a game, in my opinion, is that the players feel that they at least do something clever or smart. You don't get that feeling here, so you get a little indifferent about what you do.

Edit: Increased it to 7 after playing with 3 players. Then, you have a perfect amount of control/no control, and it's really fast and fun.

A fun betting game where you try to make some money between multiple legs of a race. Hedging bets on which camel will come in first and last place, and which camels will be in the first or second position at the end of each leg of the race. It's fun being able to place oasis tokens in such a way that they can help spring some of the lagging camels up ahead of the pack, or to cause the leading camels to fall behind to the bottom of a leading stack. It can really throw off the order of things, which keeps the guessing game interesting from start to finish.

Camel racing game that is fairly mediocre. 
Although there are 5 different options for your turn the state of the board dictates which is best to undertaken on your turn and so it feels very limited and quite samey from turn to turn. 

The blind bidding cards seem over costed as this can swing the game completely after the race part is over and to be honest felt a little tacked on to keep adults interested in this child friendly racing game.

I am glad i got to try it before purchasing it as I believe my daughter (9) would have outgrown this very simple game quite quickly and indeed after one play I am not racing to get this back to the table.

We liked it and I'll happily play again. I think Splendor is a better game and should have won the 2014 SdJ over Camel Up, but I can see why this won. It accommodates more players, it's more family friendly, it's cuter themed, there are good decisions and balances and you are more affected by the other players choices. But as each leg drew to a close, it came down much on the luck of the dice, despite how we might try to affect the moves. The whole pyramid was nice, but really just draw the dice from a bag and roll them. The dice aren't even weighted, so it falls to random luck and despite the thought involved, it has too much chance.

I think this is actually a pretty great game, but think that "betting" games are not so much for me.  With large numbers of players, if they are new and taking the "roll dice" action a lot, you can find yourself having little (or possibly even nothing) to do on a round. 

I love the components though - the die rolling pyramid and stacking camels are fun.

Well. I guess I can see why the jury chose Camel Up as the Spiel des Jahres. It's quite easy to grasp, plays quickly, and - with people in the right mood anyway - will easily ellicit some cheering and Schadenfreude. Those are nice qualities for a family game.

However, the actual game here is really thin. Betting on the camels comes down to simple probability calculations, and since there is almost no way to actually influence the race results, that's pretty much all there is to it.

Fast, light and fairly random. I am unsure about the replayability of the game, as I've only played it twice. But the mechanics were refreshing and everybody seemed to enjoy it. I generally don't like light games, but this is as good as it gets for me.

Update: Played it a few more times, I still enjoy it, however all of my (new) fellow players were a bit bored. I guess it was too straightforward for them - the game does not really have an arc. I can relate to this, but the racing/betting aspect, the little pyramid and the jumping camels are just too cool.

I think I liked this more than I thought I would. I've only played it with 2 players, which isn't so tense - and my rating reflects how I think I'd feel about it with more players. There obvious luck in the game, but just enough stuff to control your score and little other things that it makes it a rather interesting push-your-luck dice game. Nice presentation too! Deserved the SdJ I think. It's exactly the type of game that would win it and fits with other winning games of the past.

I was definitely not expecting to like this one, but it was incredibly refreshing.

It's basically very random, but it's random in an interesting and exciting way and there are some tactical options. The way the camels move is genius, the betting is simple and not very punishing and there are interesting options for what to do each turn. Not really my kind of game but when you want a quick, simple game that plays many, it's hard to beat.

For some quick dice-driven luck, I haven't experienced a game this fun since Manila. Camel Up is not going to blow your mind. It is not going to make you think. But, by letting go of pretensions, I have seen tables shouting with joy and groaning in dismay, which is a pretty fantastic feat for a game about camel meeples being pushed around a square space. 

What makes the game? The "dice pyramid"! There's something about seeing the dice pop out of that pyramid that is so much more exciting than just chucking dice.

Update: I dropped the score after being over-exposed to this one. The game's betting mechanic offers diminishing returns but I'll still play it once in a while if requested.

Opinion: in my opinion the game is what you should expect from it. A light/ family game to play with almost everybody, teaching it in less than 10 mins and playing more than once in a row. You do not have much to think in each turn, just bet or move. At first glance you could see that everything is depending on luck, but there is some control or something you can foresee in the game

The strategy of this game is much more elusive than you would expect from a game that is, basically, for kids. I had to play a few games to get the nuance of the strategy and another few to get good at it, but thankfully it's a quick game.  

You're essentially bidding on probabilities, and the game richly rewards the player who bids first but still mildly penalizes incorrect guesses, so you have to weigh when to bid on camels along the spectrum of "possible winner" to "sure bet", knowing full well that the situation can change drastically with just one die roll. There is some luck involved, but a good player will still win most of the time.

Yes, it's a nice introductory game for non-gamers. Yes, it has racing camels that kids and families can enjoy. Yes, it's light and simple, but with some momentarily meaningful decisions along the way (or at least they feel that way for one turn, but perhaps only that one one turn). And I'm happy that it plays up to 8. But it's just a big "meh" for me. The race isn't all that exciting, and the strategy is too light to feel rewarding even if I win. I'm keeping this one for the kids, and will let my game group try it a few more times before I begin considering its exit from my collection. But that evaluation process needs to begin NOW.

Once upon a time I went on a long journey on a camel.  T'was indeed a bumpy ride.  I tell the long version every time we pull Camel Up from the shelf.  This has no bearing on my opinion of the game but why break a habit?  Camel Up is nothing if not entertaining.  A race can take as little as 15 mins, we never play just once, and there are always cheers and boos as the winning camel crosses the line.  It is colourful, witty (a touch whacky, even)and fun.  And when I swear never to tell my tale again I can look forward to hearing the long suffering groans as I happily break my promise.  I love meta-gaming.

First off, the font clearly states Camel Cup.  Otherwise the capitol "c" would extend above the lowercase "a" and not down past the bottom of the "u".  Also, if the second word was "up", the "u" would be bigger than the "p".  Secondly, there is the exact same probability of 1, 2, or 3. . . This means there is little to no strategy to, well, anything.  I see no reason to not bet on the real ponies if this is your thing.  At least you could wave your winnings around instead of gloating that "My 33% came up and yours didn't."  I could see this being a really good game if all the dice had different probabilities or there were more ways to make long vs short term decisions.

A cute race game with enough chaos to make betting almost impossible. I thought it would make a good party game for my non-gaming social group but I had a hard time explaining it; it isn't that complicated. It wasn't generally liked by either my non-gaming group nor my gaming group.

RATING: 5.5
Very light race betting game. The movement mechanic, which includes stacking wooden camels, is quite original, but also very random and abstract. Having camels racing in Egypt sets the game apart from the more usual horse races and gives room for a gimmicky pyramid to roll dice. Not only the values rolled are important, but also the order in which the dice come out. Since you can, on your turn, either roll a die or bet, this creates a situation where you don't want to roll, because it gives more information to the other players. There are some tactical decisions, but luck obviously plays a big role.

Tétova tevefutam
Kellemes szórakozást ígérő versenyfutam 2-8 játékos részére, szuper autók helyett itt kétpúpú tevékkel versenyezve. Játékosaink messzi földről érkezett vagy helyi fogadók (hölgyek és urak vegyesen), akik megpróbálják a szerencsét saját javukra állítva a legtöbb pénzt megszerezni a futam végig.
A játék javára írható, hogy több játékos esetében is arányaiban rövid a játékidő, könnyen tanulhatóak a szabályok (amely magyarul is elérhető). A magas szerencsefaktort vagy tudja valaki tolerálni, vagy nem. Természetesen a játék vége felé már jobban látszik, hogy melyik púpos hoz több pénzt a konyhára, akár az első helyre várjuk, akár az utolsóra, de addig a szerencsésebb kezűek már fogadtak arra a „paripára”. Bár azt még maga Allah sem tudja megmondani, hogy az első pár szakasz tevéi közül ki keveredik ki győztesen a homokfújta sivatagi pálya káoszából a célszalagnál, átvágva a délibábok és oázisok mezői között. De talán ilyen lehet egy igaz arab futam, egyre fokozódó hangzavar, szitkozódás, imádság, izzadás, majd a végén pénzzel teli csillogó szemű nyertesek és újabb futamot kérő vesztesek.
Na ennek megfelelően vagy a te játékod, vagy nem. Nekem tetszik.
Megjegyzés: több játékosnál egy-két szerencsés fogadás már a győzelemhez vezet, azonban kevesebb személynél már több jó fogadás szükséges ehhez.

On your turn pick a camel to win. If your camel wins you get X amount of coins at the end of that league. If you pick a tile which allows you to roll a die collect 1 coin at the end of the league.

FUNNEST part of this game is that camels can stack on top of each other and when the camel below moves, all camels stacked on top of it moves too !

This is one of the games that my 7-year-old keeps pulling down from the shelves begging to play.  And for a game that I, my son, and guests both new and old to board games find enjoyable, it must be doing something right.  

Coupling this with the Supercup expansion and you've got a fun time on your hands.  And bonus marks for not overstaying its welcome with a relatively short playtime.  Guests don't grow weary and typically want to play a second round.

Lighthearted and thoroughly enjoyable, I don't see this game coming out of rotation any time soon.

"A Camel Upban egy dolgot lehet tenni: reménykedni. A játékosoknak szinte semmilyen ráhatásuk nincsen magára a versenyre és annak eredményére, leszámítva a sivatag/
oázisjelölőket, amelyek, még ha minimálisan is, de befolyásolni tudják a verseny menetét. A verseny már a kezdetektől egészen a végéig a kockákon múlik, hiszen már a tevék kezdő pozícióját is azokkal dobjuk ki, az egymás nyakába mászó tevék szinte teljes káoszban rohannak a cél felé, bármilyen kidolgozott stratégia teljesen felesleges.
Az egyetlen lépés, amivel hozzátehetünk a játékhoz az, amikor az egyik tevét léptetjük, de ezzel sem magunknak segítünk, hanem a többi játékosnak, hiszen a lépés után (főleg az utolsó előtti teve lépésénél) már látszani fog, hogy melyik teve biztosan nem fog nyerni, és melyik tevéknek van még esélyük a nyerésre – viszont ekkorra már általában elfogynak a szavazólapok.
A Camel up egy viccesen kaotikus játék, amit egy másodpercig sem szabad komolyan venni. Kisebb gyerekekkel
ideális játék, hiszen a szerencsén kívül szinte semmi más
nem számít, és minél többen játsszuk, annál jobb." 
De komolyabb játékosok kerüljék el messziről.

It`s a fun game, I recommend using the Super Cup expansion, since without it Camel Up feels like a really light filler or a kids game, but with the expansion the players has more actions to choose from. Avoid using all 4 modules at the same time when are you are playing in a bigger group, because it`s lengthening the game too much.

Light betting/speculation game. Players are placing bets each round on the positions in the race of the different camels. Each round, each camel will move once (when its die is randomly rolled), but the tricky thing is if there are other camels on top of the camel that is moving, they all advance! So things can get a bit silly and change very quickly.

A race game where the players bet on races which they can influence indirectly.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
There's only so much game you can squeeze out of a racing theme, after all how many tactics are there in going as fast as possible? Here the emphasis is very much on betting as the camels move in a random sequence, but you can bet on overall winners and losers as well as first and second places over each leg. The only weak point is that you don't actually want to move a camel as that gives more information to the next player, and your reward? A scant $1. So a high luck factor, but often uproariously funny as the most obvious winners get landed on by those behind. This is plain and simply fun and the best race game since Snow Tails.

Great components - esp. the camels and dice pyramid! Good family game - first couple of games can be simplified by leaving out the mirage/oasis tiles, though the game is definitely better for their inclusion as they give players more agency in influencing the course of the game. Preferably for 4+ players as this means at least one player will 'miss out' on the opportunity to all back the same camel in a leg-scoring, giving more weight to their decision-making per leg of the race).

Got off to a slow start in our first family play, but things picked up at the end as we all finally figured out how to play optimally. I think our next go will be even better. 

Update: Second play was better, and we had some fun, but the boys are not asking to play again. I'm not too excited about it either. Not a big fan of betting games, so maybe that is why I'm underwhelmed with this one. In the end it's cute and can surely offer the right audience a fun time, but I'm surprised this one beat out Splendor, which is one of the current family favourites at home.

Despite being very simple and a huge luck factor this game is really fun and exciting. With a bit of strategy one can improve one's chances to win. To lose unluckily is totally fine in this fast game. 

It depends a bit with whom one plays this game, though. I once played it with geeks who love to burn their neurons over a 3 hour game, and they didn't leave their usual pondering gaming mode in Camel Up: it was really boring.  

But if you have some outgoing, humerous folks to play with, Camel Up is awesome, even for me as a strategy game lover!

I picked this up on sale, and haven't been disappointed with my purchase. This has been especially popular with my non-gamer friends, and its capacity to scale well with small and large groups with ease has given it real staying power. The randomness certainly makes planning difficult, but that's created a lot of the tension and quick reversals of fortune that has made this so fun, and funny, to play.

At first I was skeptical as to how this was GOTY worthy.  But it was soon clear just how replayable and family-friendly this game is.  It's total chaos, and you'll be changing your bets almost every turn you have - but that's what's so great about it, you could never feel disappointed or upset about losing all your money in this game as the journey to the finish line is so wacky and random.

Granted, the randomness will turn a lot of people off, but I think this is a great family game.

Bokkensprong 15/04/'16 met Noor, Pepijn, Pieter, Ruthje en ik. Toegankelijk familiespel waarbij je moet gokken welke van vijf gekleurde kamelen de etappe/de hele race zal winnen/verliezen. In je beurt doe je één van vier acties: 1) een kameel evenveel stappen verplaatsen als de dobbelsteen met de overeenkomstige kleur (komt uit piramide). Kamelen die reeds op deze kameel staan, verplaatsen mee; 2) een etappekaart nemen in de kleur van de kameel waarvan je denkt dat die de etappe zal winnen (levert 5, 3, 2 ptn op als je juist gokt, of -1 als je fout gokt); 3) één van je vijf eigen racekaarten leggen bij de kameel waarvan je denkt dat die de eindrace zal winnen of verliezen (kan van 8 tot -1 ptn opleveren); 4) een woestijntegel op de racebaan leggen die ptn oplevert als er een kameel op eindigt, en die die vervolgens een plaats naar voren of naar achteren stuurt. Leuk familiespel.

Cute game for young kids, but there's really nothing to it at all. It's pleasant enough but I'm not sure why a group of adults would feel the need to sit down and play it. Since every die comes out exactly once each round it makes the betting go from complete guesswork to near guarantees pretty quickly.

Camel Up is a fun race betting game that can be enjoyed by everybody - children and adults, gamers and non-gamers. It's very quick to teach and evokes a lot of excitement with the right group as you cheer on the camels hoping for good (or bad) dice rolls.  Very dynamic, very interactive, very light, and all fun for it.  The one element that hardcore gamers must be ready to accept is less deterministic game play.  There are times the player can bet on safe odds, but overall the dice make luck as key as strategy.  But isn't that the point of race betting, anyway?

Initial Rating: 3.0 (July 2015)

As 2014 Spiel des Jahres Winner I was extremely wary about Camel Up! The games they choose are almost always disliked by me. I tried to stay far away from it but a friend dragged me into a game.  As it turned out I was correct, I heavily dislike Camel Up! 

The game is almost pure luck AND it is too long for the level of luck (the game isn’t that long, what I’m saying is that game duration Vs. the luck factor doesn’t fit with my gaming interests). It has obvious decisions and/or uninformed decisions, the game situation can change radically from one turn to the next so you have very little room to plan, pure chaos.

I heavily dislike racing themes.

On the good side, the game components are very good, the pyramid is gorgeous and clever and the art is great too.

Bottom line, Camel Up! can be fun (if played with the correct game group), however I feel I wasted my precious gaming time playing it. I think it can be a great family game geared toward children but it is way too light for me. Almost pure luck. I won’t ever play it again.

All the elements of betting, without any of the thrill. it felt torturous playing this game. i understand that there is a gamble dynamic, but it really is just a load of pot luck. i don't understand why you need to bother with all the game elements when we could bet on what number comes up on a d6. No real skill or thought required, would be fun for kids to play.

First of all the game is obviously named "Camel Cup".  You can clearly see the use of the oversize "C" on the cover to indicate that BOTH words use the same letter.  Besides it'e a RACING game...the prize for winning a race is often times a "cup".  Wow, I can't believe more people don't see this.  Anyway (rant over) ...Camel CUP may be considered "light" by many gamers, but whatever....this game is TONS of fun!  Stacking camels and betting on the winner? Dumping dice out of a pyramid?  Really?  What's not to love?!!?  Definitely a keeper!  Quick, family friendly, simple to learn and teach.  Get it.  Play it.  Ignore the nay-sayers.

RATING: 8.1
This was one I really enjoyed. The two best parts, the camels can stack on one another and there's a "dice-pyramid" which allows for one die to be rolled at a time to move the camels. On a player's turn, they can do one of four things: One, roll a die with the pyramid to move a camel or a group of camels (like I said, camels stack so if a camel has camels on top of it and it needs to move, it carries the other camels with it. Two, place a desert or oasis tile on the board that can either help or hurt a camel by allowing it to move ahead one extra space or move back one. Three, place a bet on which camel they think will be in the lead during one leg of the race. And four, place a bet on which camels they think will either win the race or lose the race. Excellent and fun game with a lot of variety. I would like to try this one out with the full compliment of eight people sometime in the future.

One of my favorite party games.  This is one of the few games, besides social deduction games, that can accommodate my entire family of seven.  This is a betting game, not a race game.  So, with a party game that involves betting, yes, there will be some luck involved.  Surprise!  The element that makes that game fun is weighing whether to make a bet now, with little information, or take my buck and give others more information.  There is also the element of laying tiles on the track which can upset other people's bets or enhance your own.  Only three simple decisions, but a lot of fun.

Camel Up (or is it Cup?) is a great game when you consider its goal to bring more people into tabletop games.  We trade high chance and limited options in order to gain accessibility, simple mechanics, and the chance to get a wider audience to play games that actually engage the brain.

There is a nice balance of risky bets and conservative plays, and plenty of options: players can choose to move the race along or instead rig the race or place bets before others. Players with a head for probabilities will find something to dig in to while playing casually is just as enjoyable.

Camel Up's short length (15-30 minutes) means more variance and less skill, but makes it easy to bring in new players and play multiple games.

Fun party game of betting on camel races. It's not about influence, it's about estimating the odds and successfully betting against the trend or at least being the first to set the trend. The dice pyramid is a nice although unreliable gimmick that makes the game. I'm not sure if there's enough fun to it for repeated play.

Simple betting on a race game that is great fun for a family but not strategic or heavy enough for gamers. A bit overpriced and fiddly with the pyramid so I wouldn't quite recommend it, but the camel meeples really do give it a hump up over some similar games. The theme was the reason it won the spiel, but I feel like it would need an expansion to feel complete.

RATING: 6.8
This is a fun time filler game as the game setup is about 5 minutes and play time is about 10-15 depending on the play group.  It is fun, but it is one that wore out on me pretty quickly so one to two games per sitting would be the right amount.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

The rules are not hard to learn, the game mechanics is interesting. The leading camel may easily become last, because o other camels climbing on top of it or because of desert tiles in front of it. So it is quite hard to forecast, which camel will be the first and which one - the last. On the other hand it is too dependent on dice for my taste. There is not enough place for strategy.

Žaidimo taisyklės nesudėtingos, mechanika įdomi. Pirmaujantis kupranugaris dėl ant jo užlipančių kitų kupranugarių ar dėl dykumos laukelių prieš jį nesunkiai gali tapti paskutiniu, todėl pakankamai sudėtinga prognozuoti, kas bus pirmas, o kas paskutinis. Kita vertus, mano skoniui per daug priklauso nuo kauliukų. Labai daug čia nepristrateguosi.

This really is alot of fun.  Turns can happen quickly, which i like.  You should go into this game expecting a fun party/gambling game and you'll be happy.  Pretty much every turn you take is a gamble where you wrestle with probability.  Many laughs are elicited when things go awry and you'll get a good pop too when your plans do work out.  Get the Supercup expansion for more fun.

A likeable party game that I am a bit wary to play with a high amount of players, especially if you decide to have the oasis / desert tiles to provide income. The camels riding on each other is a great invention that really juices up the concept of the game. Mechanisms are few and easy, but might still be hard to grasp for the younger audience. But generally this is a pretty splendid racing / betting game that plays quickly and could still be fun even if you've fallen too far behind. The dice tower is cool.

Several camels are racing around a track and the players try to bet on the winner of each stage and both final winner and loser. The earlier you place (the right) bet, the higher the reward. A little indirect manipulation and that's basically it. Though still fun it's nothing I'd actively seek out.

Fast and fun betting game and risk assessment.

Edit: After many plays, half a point less because it's long to set up for very short time playing it (and then packing it up again). So not very good if you want just one play.
It's still fun to play multiple times so unpacking and packing it becomes a minor problem

A light luck racing game that the whole family can play. Player actions are simple and the camels can end up in all sorts of different combinations with the +1/-1 movement tiles.

A bit too over-engineered for its own good, as a single dice roll can make all positions in a leg, or even in a race, go from barely discernible to almost certain. That said, it's a good light game: the theme is plausible, goes fast and is easy to teach.

01-13-2015 - Who knew?  Well, I guess the Germans did.  It did win the SdJ after all.  I wasn't eager to play this much at all, but finally gave into the hype and gave it a shot.  It's a lot of fun!  I plan to buy it sooner than later.

RATING: 5.8
Played once in a 6-player game. Everyone had things to do and people could play cute moves that altered which camel landed on top or bottom if the right numbers were rolled. But after a while, one camel's in the lead and everyone's just buying stock in that one. Too heavy on the luck factor for my tastes, so that it feels like gambling, but enough minor elements of strategy that I could play it again to please a large group.

What a great game.  This is well received by everyone that we have played it with and I don't know of a time where we didn't play it multiple times because it is fast and simple.  People get that "I CAN DO BETTER NEXT TIME" feel and we keep playing.  Love it.

RATING: N/A
An interesting game with a lot of luck involved.  It's hard to predict where the game will go and lots of variability from one game to the next.  For the level of complexity involved, this is a very quick game.  When introducing it to five new players at game group, everyone immediately wanted to play a second game after the learning game was completed.

This was really fun with a mixed group of kids and adults.  Everyone could enjoy it to some degree or another.   Some interesting choices to be made.  The pyramid gimmick however, could really go.

Added the "Supercup" expansion to hopefully make it better.

Fast filler in betting genre. But is it fun? Not that much. Sure, I'm ready to play this again although it's far from the best ones out there... I guess this works pretty well when played with family. The dice-pyramid looks good, but it isn't that handy - bag with dice rolls would be better solution.

RATING: N/A
In Camel Up, up to eight players bet on five racing camels, trying to suss out which will place first and second in a quick race around a pyramid. The earlier you place your bet, the more you can win — should you guess correctly, of course. Camels don't run neatly, however, sometimes landing on top of another one and being carried toward the finish line. Who's going to run when? That all depends on how the dice come out of the pyramid dice shaker, which releases one die at a time when players pause from their bets long enough to see who's actually moving!

It's a fun family/party race game. Everyone I know compares it to Winner's Circle while there are other Knizia race games it could also be compared to. But these comparisons just aren't right, and if you expect some kind of Winner's Circle here, you are going to be disappointed. It is a very enjoyable game but not the one about heavy meaningful decisions, more like the one about opportunistic moves, fun twists of fortune, certainly a level of chaos (the more players the stronger) and a somewhat crazy theme.

I really enjoyed this game. I was hyped to play it, and I think it did its job really well and lived up to the hype. It's not super competitive, but it's competitive enough to keep people drawn to the game. Oh, and it's a game that doesn't suffer from Munchkinitis, which is a great achievement. The luck aspect (its reliance on dice rolls) isn't actually a deterrence in this game, because it's not going to be that game that carries the party: that's reserved for more resource-intensive games like Puerto Rico, Le Havre, and Agricola/Caverna. This game is just cool because it's a solid time-waster that keeps the hardcore gamers occupied with strategy, and the casual gamers enticed by easy rules and an element of randomness so that you're never truly out of it.

What an absolute blast this game is.  Quite easy to learn and play, you spend the game making a wager on who will win a leg of the race, who will take first overall in the race and who will place last.  You're not actually playing a camel, but the role of a spectator placing bets on the race.  The game is structured in such a way that it allows for a comeback of a camel in the back of the pack, and as a result, for a player who is losing as well.  I enjoy this aspect in a game (unlike 7 Wonders Duel where if you lost out on a resource in the first round, you've lost out for good).

This game shares many similarities with Colt Express for me: really novel components and a decent amount of strategy for this family/party game but this can be completely screwed over by the chaos of the game, with the game being silly and short enough that I don't mind the chaos. I gave it a lower rating than Colt Express though because I like the action programming of the latter and the fact that you could technically predict your opponents' actions in the rounds they play cards facedown, whereas in this game you can get screwed over by pure luck. Still a great game for the genre and its nice that it plays a wide player range.

Fun, quick, light game! Easy to pick-up, somewhat more strategic than it seems at first glance, but light enough to play through quickly and get some laughs. Great component quality and I love the art. 

The downsides are somewhat tied into the lightness, where it often feels like random chance is more important than what you choose to do. Also, turn order can really screw you over when an outcome becomes clearer and the bets on that outcome are snatched up before you get a chance.

Wonderful chaotic game in which you have no control (at all? :-) ). Also, there is a problem with the fact that rolling the die is never really a good idea for the player rolling. Because most of the time it's the next player that will benefit from the roll, since more information is then available. 
But nevertheless, this is a fun game for people that like to gamble. Can be played with children and the whole family. The more people playing, the merrier. 

The camels that stack is a very original feature of this game where you also have to predict who will win.

This game reminds me of [thing=54735][/thing], because it's also a funny unpredictable race where you can bet on who the winner will be.

Due to the size of the box you may not realize it, but this is a fantastic filler.  It provides a little bit of luck, some jockeying for position by making smart bets & placing your desert/oasis tile well, and calculating odds, plus it fits perfectly into a 30 minute time slot.

There is luck in the game.  However, it wouldn't be much of a betting game, if it didn't.  You know how the camels are currently positioned, the numbers on the dice, and which dice haven't pulled from the pyramid yet.  This gives you a ton of information on how to bet each leg, but nothing is set in stone.  That's what makes it tense and exciting!

If you hate any sort of luck, stay away from Camel Up.  If you like playing the odds, check it out!

This is a rough game to categorize. It definitely has it's place. The problem is that when you try to play this game out of it's place, it's really bad. It's not a game to play with any serious tones at all. No one will have fun if anyone is taking the game too seriously. For me, the perfect place for this game is with some kids or people not looking to deep dive into a game at all. In that spot, it works pretty well.

The game does take a bit too long for what it is though. It says 20-30 minutes, and I'd say it's closer to 30 minutes, which is too long. I think 15 minutes would be about perfect for this game.

All in all, it's not a bad game to have in a collection, but I wouldn't say it's a "must have".

A stripped down version of Manilla? Well, that's the best comparison I can make anyway. In both games you are betting on an object (camel or punt) to reach the finish line. They both have multiple "legs," in both cases you are not tied to any specific racing object, and of course, in both cases you are gambling. There are several differences though. I'm not a big fan of Manilla with 5. It seems that the board is too tight with 5, and not tight enough with 3. So, I think the sweet spot for Manilla is 4. I've only played Camel Up with 4, but I feel like it would be better with more. 8 might be too many (too long), but I could see 5 or 6 being great! Scalability just seems better in general with Camel Up. I would also argue that it is a better design. However, that doesn't necessarily make me like it better. Another differences that was aforementioned is the fact that this trims the fat of Manilla quite a bit. Of the Spiel contenders this year, I've played Splendor and Camel Up. This one wins by a landslide. 

Update 11/25/14: After 2 more plays (with 4), I've found that it's impossible to calculate simple odds in this game. The possibilities for how camels are stacked and how they more are too complex to identify until most of the dice have come out. Honestly, it's rather chaotic. That said, the best player will still generally win, because that player recognizes when critical opportunities arise. In other words, this game is all about timing. 

Update: I've played it at 4 and 5 players now. It plays really well at both play counts. I actually might like it better at 4. It's already really tight with 5. 5 players becomes more about turn order than timing bets. 

Update 3/21/15: Erin played with the CORE a few nights ago. There were plenty of loud roars and cheers. Everyone had a great time! 

Update 12/29/15: Played this with Donna and Reg tonight. They are FAR from gamers and had a fun tim playing it! This game is so awesome! I'm going to download the iPad app now. I am finally upgrading this to a "9" out of "10."

I like the idea that rather than control the camels, you are just betting on who's gonna win, it's fun. And the way the camels can carry other camels on their back makes this game surprisingly entertaining. That and a high player count make it a funny party game.

FUN: Looks cool, is easy to teach and plays fast. It also handles larger groups quite well.

UNIQUE: the pyramid and stacking mechanic are a unique way to get a controlled, yet unprefictable movement.

NEGATIVES: I'll probably tire of this game eventually as it doesn't play very differently every time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Update: Third and final session. What´s up with the one coin you get for rolling the dice? You give all the other players lots of information they can react on before you can, and all you get is that one point? I never roll the dice unless there really is nothing else to do.

Update: Down to a 4 after a second game. This can probably work with children, but for adults I find this close to pointless.

Hm, nothing wrong in particular with the game, but you have very little information and almost no chance to affect the race. Will play again but not too often.

Once you get past the fact that you don't actually own one of the camels this is a really fun, tactical gambling game.

Camel Up would be great fun played for real money. As is, it's definitely a solid family game and maybe more. I am wondering if there are optimal moves under the surface that would give you an edge over many plays. I think people are too quick to dismiss skill-based games with high variance. I'd like to at least give this game some more thought before dismissing it.

Fantastic game which appeals to both casual and more serious gamers. It's a light game for sure and the luck factor can be crucial but I feel that I can improve my winning chances by making (what I consider) the correct decisions. 
People tend to be either too conservative or too bold with their bets so I think that despite the luck factor, people who better understand the odds will gain some satisfaction by winning more often than the average player.
The game lasts around 20 minutes for us and it's filled with delightful tension and many unexpected and often humorous twists. Usually everyone wants to play again and again and again... Even when I lose badly due to bad luck I don't mind it because the game is always super fun.

I like Camel Up.  I do.  Really, I do.  However, Splendor and Concept are MUCH MUCH better games and they were ROBBED of the 2014 Spiel des Jahres and that will always diminish my respect for Camel Up, even though it's probably not Camel Up's fault that they won (unless they bribed the jury!).

Camel Up was the most spiel-ey of the bunch though, in the sense that players of all ages can sit down together and enjoy the game.  Everyone I have played this game with has LIKED it - but they have not LOVED it.

Better than I expected, I guess. The game is really chaotic, but that's fine. The betting is pleasantly uncertain, when everything can change very quickly. A neat design, and good for larger groups. I've tried with seven, and it was crazy fun (but it was a good crowd of friends; I wouldn't probably bother with strangers).

Indifferent when played with gamers, but well worth "Suggest" as a family game. The player scale that goes up to eight is clearly a bonus and the main reason this'll have a place in my collection.

Suggest.

I hadn't heard of this game before so went in with an open mind, but not expecting much and was pleasantly surprised by the fun little racing/betting game.

I liked the chaotic nature of movement, as well as the tile that help or hinder movement, can make the order of the camels shift rapidly. Makes betting quite a fun challenge.

Would definitely play again

RATING: 6
It's pretty good for what it is - a light fun family game. Definitely not something you want to overthink, but if you can just turn your brain off and go with it, it can be a lot of fun. It also plays quickly, which of course is a must for a racing game. 

The one thing I did find mildly annoying is that you can sometimes have an easy and obvious good move fall in your lap when the player before you rolls a die to move a camel, depending of course on which camel moved and what effect it had on the race. That wouldn't be a big deal if it averaged out, but it doesn't, because it only happens a couple/few times during the whole game, so it ends up being sort of a lottery. That's really a minor nit, though. After all, it is a racing game dictated by die rolls, so one has to expect that people will sometimes just get lucky rolls.

Camel Cup ist ein einfaches Familienspiel, zu dem man auch gerne mal einen absoluten Brettspielmuffel einladen kann. Das Spielmaterial ist hübsch und optisch ansprechend, dabei sieht es auch noch einfach total witzig aus. Bei Camel Cup wetten die Spieler bei einem Kamelrennen auf dem Sieger und Verlierer des Rennens und der einzelnen Etappen. Der Gag an der Sache ist, dass die hölzernen Kamelfiguren auf aufeinander gestapelt werden können und so ein Kamel das andere "trägt". dabei entstehen die witzigsten (Renn-)Situationen und das Rennen kann sich tatsächlich noch einmal drehen. Das bei Camel Cup natürlich Glück einen hohen Stellenwert hat, empfinde ich als nicht weiter schlimm, da es sich so schnell, flott und unkompliziert spielt, dass man auch gerne die eine oder andere Runde mehr spielt.

This is a supper fun family filler new to games people game.. Every Time i have played this everybody has had a ruddy good time.. I find it odd how much i enjoy this as i tend to lean towards those heavy strategic games and tend to dislike games driven by pure luck.. And this is a game of pure luck-ish stuff.. If you take it in the context of what it is and don't expect any deep tactical decision, then you could also have a ruddy good time with this crazy camel racing party in a box..

Wow, yes there is a fair amount of randomness but the sheer delight in seeing someone back the camel in the lead only to see it jumped upon on the very next turn is great! Plenty of fun in this little game and it goes to 8 (at which point I think any form of strategy goes out of the window!)

Bit of an impulse buy after reading rave reviews. Sounded like a game right up my alley, but a bit disappointed in it. Components are top notch and it's fun to see the camels stack up and watch crazy reversals of fortune. 

However, something about it doesn't click and I think it has to do with the betting. I prefer Longshot which, although longer, captures the feeling of betting on a race a lot better while still managing to be relatively light - I have played Longshot with plenty of nongamers and had fun. 

Camel Up is good, especially if you are looking for a quick filler at 30 minutes or less, but it's made me appreciate Longshot a lot more. 

Played: 5 times.

UPDATE: Taken off of trade because other people really seem to enjoy it as a light filler. I'm still kinda "meh" on it, but keeping it around for that reason.

Pure betting game offering less control with more players, and making each individual turn more important. Worth a play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Camel Up is a racing/betting game where the player with the most money at the end wins. 

Players are able to take one of four actions each turn and they can place bets on legs of the race as well as the final result. 

The two elements that make it unique are the pyramid dice rolling component, which is kind of neat and the fact that camels can stack and in doing so the order of the camels can be altered.

This really is a very light game that is more 'beer & pretzels' than it is anything else.

The game can be exciting at times but the amount of control is quite limited so work out your mileage based on that.  

A game I'm happy to play a few times a year for a laugh with the right group but not one I need to own.

Despite taking longer to play, I still think Long Shot is the better game.

This game is a riot. As long as you treat it as a game of probability, the game isn't nearly as random as it seems. Scales incredibly well from 2 to 8, with there being more luck as the player count increases due to limited betting actions that can be taken. Not particularly memorable, but an excellent filler in family situations.

Is this a children's game or a gamers' game? Art and theme point to the former but the betting mechanisms point to the latter. Each camel only has one die each round but since she may be carried, she may still advance. Should you bet on a leader? On a final winner? Or should you place a tile to make the camels moving one more or less step? Well, do you feel lucky?

At first glance this may seem to be a racing game, but really it is a betting game, the stakes aren't real and the game is very quick so if you guess poorly and end up out of the running it doesn't sting too much. The stacking camel mechanic is more than just humorous, it makes it deceptively tricky to puzzle out which camel is likely to be left behind and which it likely to take the lead. The artwork it colorful and the pyramid dice-rolling gimmick is the icing on the cake, everyone wants to use that thing and move the camels along. 

If I could only use one word to describe this game it would be [b]F-U-N FUN![/b] So much fun. 

When I played this with for the first time it had exactly that reaction that you would hope for in a game, everyone laughing and joking around, lots of table talk, and then when it was over the unanimous request to [i][b]LET'S PLAY AGAIN[/b][/i]!

Camel Up somehow manages to do a fantastic job of simulating a the feeling of a day at the (strangely Camel-based) races. There's a nice blend of luck vs. logic to this one and it's amazingly easy to see how it won so many awards. The whole game revolves around betting on which camel is most likely to win each segment of the race, however early bids have better odds and leaving it too late can really hurt your winnings.

RATING: 7
This is a light family game that won the 2014 Spiel des Jahres. There are five different colored camels that are racing around a board. The race consists of a few legs, with payouts given to the winner of each leg and the game ends when one camel crosses the finish line. Players have 4 choices on their turn: get a bet token for payout on a leg, roll a die, bet on overall winner or loser, or place their oasis token (which when a camel lands on, can move it +1 or -1 spot).

It's quite unpredictable until the end, and it is fun.  The more players there are, the less control there is, so just enjoy the ride. There is a lot of luck, but the game is actually enjoyable. There is a lot of groaning, laughing and making fun of other people's bets. My rating is more about the experience and fun, not for the skill involved. I haven't tried this game with 7 or 8 players yet.

(Even though it's light, I think the subtle touches that allow you to affect chance help a bit, and I definitely feel the tension when the "camels align")

Very group-dependent, both in terms of size and attitude, but with the right mindset a clever betting game that forces players to make uninformed decisions and hope that they pay off.

Despite my low rating, I consider this to be an essential family game. It plays very well with groups of different sizes, ages, and gaming experience levels.

The core concepts here are simple, but consistently manage to bring out cheers and jeers as camels hop to the front of the line at unexpected moments.

The Supercup expansion comes highly recommended - the extra dice in particular are a fantastic addition.

RATING: 9
A dice-driven racing game in which betting for current leader occurs each turn, and each turn consists of one die roll for each camel. The twist (and name of the game) comes from the fact that camels stack and carry one another by landing on the same space. It reminds me of Top Race, but this one's a better game. Since it's fun and supports up to 8, I can see this one hitting the table a lot.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The game says 3-8 players.  Let's get this straight: Anything above 5p and Camel Up becomes the ur-absurdist boardgame. With 3-5p, though, there's actually some tactical goodness to come out of the dice-rolls and tile-placements.

It's clear why this game won the SdJ, and it's also clear that the SdJ ain't the same award that Settlers received.

I initially despised Camel Up as a totally random/lucky game. After playing it, it certainly is a lucky game, but you still have some actions available that can affect the outcome in a small way. You still won't win if you're not lucky enough, but the game lasts only 30 minutes and it has some fun moments.

The components are OK. The pyramid replaces the usual cloth bag only to make the game more eye-catching, but it doesn't work that well. The art is quite good.

I would not recommend it to more than 6 players. It is just too random, you take very few actions.

So, it's a nice light short game that accommodates many players, but it's far from being the best family game of the year (Spiel des Jahres).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Fast and fun.  People complain about the luck in this game, but it's a gambling game.  Luck is pretty much what it's all about.  As 20 minute light fillers go this one is pretty cool! the 8 player support almost puts this into "party game" territory.

RATING: 6
First impression (3 players) : Definitely not a real game with 8 players even with just 3 it was rather random at times. Basic concept of betting which camel is 1st/2nd round/whole race is fun but like said a bit too random for more serious gaming.

Giochillo scanzonato su una particolarissima corsa di cammelli. Ogni giocatore ha un semplice obiettivo, fare più soldi possibili scommettendo sui cammelli. Le scommesse possibili sono 3: sul primo che taglierà il traguardo, sull'ultimo in classifica o scommettere sui piazzamenti internedi. Un paio di altri modi per far soldi completano il regolamento molto snello e immediato. Il gioco è piacevole per il suo coinvolgimento, i pochi tempi morti anche se il tutto è fortemente influenzato dal caso e dai dadi. Un bel family game con il grosso vantaggio che può essere giocato da 2 a 8 giocatori.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]Camel Up has easily become my favorite game played a year ago and my pick for family game of the year for games new to me in 2015. This game has been a hit with everyone we;ve introduced it to, it is a great family/gateway/party game. While not the most serious or strategic game it gets rowdy. I can't recommend this game highly enough for 4+ players, it has become a go to game when we have friends and family over. You can teach this game in about two minutes and then you're off. I am actually surprised at how much we enjoy this game and didn't think it would have the staying power it does, but it continues to get pulled off the shelf.[/i] 

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]- Awesome family/party game that can be taught to anyone in minutes.
- Components are top notch, the camel meeples are awesome!
- Fun... really fun. [i](Seriously; this game is a blast to play, trust me!)[/i]
- There is just enough happening with the camels (due to the stacking mechanism) to keep this game engaging and unpredictable, which makes each turn exciting.

After playing a few times I believe Camel Up definitely deserved to win the Spiel award. This is a game that you really have to play, reading about it will not get across just how much fun this game can be. This is not a serious game by any means and should not be judged as such. It is a gambling game with a lot of luck involved, but you will be cheering and groaning as the camels you bet on go from first to last on the final leg of a race! I highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a great game you can play with anyone.[/i]

Takes the old Russelbande piggyback movement system (which is an excellent and fun mechanic) and jazzes it into a non-kid's game by adding various forms of betting to the game. Betting isn't my favourite genre - I've ditched Manila previously - so this has upside and downside. There's no hidden information, you're just making decisions based on the odds, and to reap the big bucks you need to make decisions on what to bet on before the odds are in your favour. Which makes it a so-so guessing game really, but at least the game goes fast and provides some cheer/groan factor as the movement dice are finally revealed. I can see why it might be popular but it's nothing more than an occasional outing for me.

終盤までレース結果が予想できないバランス設計は良くできている。
しかし、レース題材の割にレグごとの点数計算がテンポを崩しており、少し煩わしく感じた。
スピード感は不足している。
シンプルな目的なのにプレイ時間を結構食うのはそれが原因の部分も有る。
盤上をパッと見てゲーム全体の状況を把握でき辛い部分も少々マイナス。
ただ、多人数プレイは非常に盛り上がる。
盛り上がるが、もう一回やろう、とはならないゲーム

Based on one play: A cute game that can be played from 2-8 but is more for a younger crowd as there is minimal strategy. The game is designed to keep things fairly close so some actions are always taken early and some always only later. Still for a large crowd of varying ages it would be fun.

Okay, this one was just silly. You're betting on a bunch of camels involved in a race, but the camels pretty much move randomly. Camels that land on the same space as other camels actually land on top of them, and are considered ahead. Furthermore, if a camel with another camel on top moves, the one on top moves with it. You get money by betting on each "leg" (a round of each camel moving once) and on the winner and loser of the entire race. The game featured chunky stackable wooden camels and an elaborate pyramid-shaped dice cup that concealed not only the distance the camel would move but also the identity of the camel that would move. These gimmicks made the game feel very silly, but really, there wasn't much game here.

2-8. Once play: not that good with two players (had a bad explanation too). Might try it again with a bigger group. The dice pyramid feels clumsy. The betting part is nice and feels rewarding yet you have very little influence on the game. I hoped this was a better game. Don't buy this.

Eh, could take it or leave it. Betting was fun, but it wasn't exactly fast for a race. Maybe if the camels had special powers or they moved faster than 1-3 spaces at a time.

RATING: 5
The idea is fun and the components are well designed (especially the camels and the pyramid). The actions are limited though, since giving more information (by rolling a die or putting a desert tile down) only serves your opponents. Sometimes I felt there was only one good option to take, so at some points I was kind of bored. Also, the luck of the dice is pretty dominating in this game.

Fun camel racing game and interactive.  Played a five player game, which felt about right.  I liked the actions of choosing to take betting cards, placing a tile, or rolling (and collecting the money for rolling).  It moved along quickly and overall a decent game.

The positioning of camels who are piggybacking can make the game a little more chaotic, however that may be okay.  I think with more players, the game would drag down.

This is another game where, almost every time I play it, I will say out loud: man! I love this game! The simple set of action choices don't bog down play but still provide real decisions to make. Each choice is a gamble and while you can do ok by going with what seems to be a sure thing, most of the time the winner is the one who sees that possibility for the long odds and jumps on it at just the right time. I love stand up dice rolls in a game. Camel Up delivers many, many moments like those in its short play time.

And they're off!  A very unique theme of camel racing.  On your turn you can bet on which camel will win and which will lose.  You can also let one dice drop from the very unique pyramid dice holder - the color determines which camel will move.  camels don't race side by side in this game but stack on top of each other as they race.  Beautiful component quality and an extremely fun game to play.

Speil des Jahres? Really?
To me this was an excercize in making choices with highly random outcome based on close to non-existent information.
I would compare this to playing "straight" Yahtzee (at least that what it's called in Sweden. That is you make the rolls in order of the scoring sheet: first ones, then twos etc).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Nice, easy, slightly chaotic but highly original game which has a lot of "standing and shouting" when the last die is rolled. Tension and regret go hand in hand here where placing a bet first can get you a lot of points, but losing it will see others score big. If betting on camels which constantly try to piggyback one another sounds like your kind of game, this is it.

Camel Up gets the feeling right for a short, chaotic racing game. The hidden bets work really well, with the best payouts going to the players that placed the bet first. There is very little players can actually do to influence the outcome of the race, but as a 20-minute experience, the game works really well.

Fast flowing betting game using the racing mechanism of Russelbande. Played one 4-player and one 7-player game. Both great fun due to frequent reversal of camel positions. It's a chaotic gambling game, but allowing for risk analysis and some control due to tile placement. Given the fixed number of possible bets, there is quite some interaction, it's not multi-solitaire gambling. A clever game.

A surprise, really. I had seen some "meh!" reviews about it and was a bit reluctant to give it a try. Finally got it in math trade and introduced it to some friends. And lo and behold: everybody had a great time!  

It is a betting game, reminiscent of Long Shot but better, because you have intermediate scorings and can mess with the track (with the oasis tiles). Even the dice pyramid, which looked a superfluous gimmick, actually works very well and increases the suspense. Plus children and non-gamers will have little trouble in joining in.

Just approach this in a party game mood and fun is guaranteed.

Seems like exactly the kind of game I'd like and the SdJ jury has a great record for me recently.

Camel Up (not to be confused with Camel Cup, a game that does not exist) is a betting racing game with camels. There are five camels of five colors, corresponding to five dice with 1-3 on them that are placed inside a convoluted pyramid to be randomly generated. Each round, or leg, of the race, you can choose to grab bet tiles (which earn you money if the camel you choose is in the lead (or one buck if it's in second), make a bet on the first or last place at the end of the race, or advance the race by producing one of the five dice (which will also reward you with a camelbuck at the end of the leg), or place a desert or oasis that if landed on gives you a buck and moves the landing camel(s) forward or back. When camels move into the same space as another camel, the stack UP on it, and if the bottom camel moves, it carries those above it. At the end of each leg you score your bets, and as soon as a camel crosses the finish, you score the race bets.

Overall, the game has some interesting nuances to interact with a random number/camel generator, producing odd movement as a camel moves forward, climbs onto another camel and then rides that one forward (possibly repeating this process with rapidly stacking camels). The physical design of the game is really great, everything is made of tile or cards just how it should be, and the board space is used just right. The pyramid die generator is I'd say sorta gimmicky, it does something a bag could do in a somewhat convoluted fashion. I crushed it quite impressively with 43 bucks, with second place only have 27, and the game plays quite quickly.

It does the whole 'race/bet' premise fairly nicely, and its mechanics are quite clever, but I'm not sure they're clever or interesting enough to truly be that great. I understand it won quite a few awards, which makes sense, but at the same time those awards are indicative of pretty middle of the road products. I'm curious about Supercup when it's completed.

This is an enjoyable quick game of ridiculous camel racing. Winners are fairly dependent on luck, as it's hard to forecast who is winning giving the various possibilities with the weird stacking camel movement and movement tiles. Even playing the probabilities will rarely reward the best moves, so it's a game best enjoyed for being a quick and somewhat silly experience where you are gambling on some good fortune that your bets pay off. And if you are interested in that, this will lead to many great times with lots of jeering and cheering based on the outcome of some die rolls. Any game that can engender such feelings is doing pretty good at making for a fun and memorable time.

2015-03-14: For a game to play with my 6/7-year-old niece and nephews, an 8! This is one fiddly racing game that my niece and nephews quite enjoyed! Although they probably can't comprehend the strategy or tactics in the game, they are still enjoying it. I don't think they understood the point of the desert tiles (and so they ignored them -- or placed them way too far ahead of track). They did understand the idea that no one owned a camel but they were betting on which one to win (even though at the beginning of the game they wanted to own one of the camels).

One plus though is how quick the games are. With kids, you tend to play the same games over and over and over again.

I suppose I would rate this a 3 if I were to play it with my regular gaming group, though, because of the total lack of control in the game.

I couldn't imaging playing this with more than four players.

UPDATE: After playing this one about 8 more times with my niece, this game will be a personal favourite of mine as I think this is probably the first "strategy" game in which my niece figured out the strategy all by herself!

Pros:
1. Mix of Luck and Strategy. This game has a great mix of luck and strategy. You can play trying to maximize probabilities, but the dice might still get you. This makes it a great family game that kids can play with adults and still win.
2. Pyramid. The pyramid dice roller that comes with this game is excellent. Fun to just play with.
3. Easy to teach. This game takes less than 5 minutes to teach.

Summary: I don't have any cons to this game. It's an all around solid game. There's nothing that jumps out at you when you're playing. You don't feel like you've accomplished anything when you win. There's a little excitement in watching the race play out. But overall, I doubt I'd ever play this game again unless it is with children. That's not a bad thing, but it does result in a lower overall score for me.

Amazing little game of luck and gambling. You're betting on the camels, but situation can change in the blink of an eye. Not entirelly mindless, you have to be good at estimating probabilities, but in the end, you'll be on the mercy of the dice gods. Which is very fine in a game like this!

We're having lots of good laugh when playing "Camel Up", and there's a bit of tension too (have to try it with real money some day). Great gateway, great beer and pretzels game, fast and crazy in a very positive way. Is it worthy of the Spiel des Jahres title? I think so - in my opinion it's more charming than other popular gateway titles of recent times, like, for example, "Splendor". Also, it has a lot of the neatness factor in the pyramid device and instantly catches one's eye.

Jugado a tres, con resaca en una casa rural. Me parece un juego muy sencillo de reglas (por lo que es muy recomendable para no jugones) y que aun así tienes toma de decisiones interesantes durante el juego, la temática encaja perfectamente y es algo curiosa, es corto en duracion y es tremendamente impredecible, por lo que no sabes quien gana hasta el ultimo momento (algo muy amigable para los no jugones). Recomendable.

Not being a huge gamer, it took the first game or two to really feel this out and get in a groove.  The good part is, it's a quick game, so I was able to get that out of the way quickly!

Once you get comfortable with the rules/options during the rounds it becomes a blast to play.  It's usually one of the my go to games if I want something a little light and quick to play.

Fast & light race/bidding game. Beautifully presented. Bet on or move camels in each leg of the race, or bet on the overall winner & loser. Fun to watch some unexpected twists due to the piggy-back mechanic!
No great depth to the game but a fairly fast & fun experience.

2P to 8P game.

It's a 5 camel race of one lap around the track.  The race is divided into several betting sessions called 'legs'....a leg is when each camel rolls the die once.  If a camel lands on another, then he stacks on top....if the bottom camel moves, everyone on top moves with him.  So you bet on which camel will be ahead at the end of the current leg.  You can also make a longer term bet (with a bigger payout) on what camel you think will win the entire race....early bets have a bigger payout, but are more likely to be wrong as the race is very dynamic and can change very quickly.

Highly recommended for a light, quick, 'laugh-at-the-result' type game.  If you want to employ a superior strategy to dominate your opponents, look elsewhere.

This game was much more fun than I thought it would be.  When a group of 30+ year old guys start giggling like school kids throughout the game you know it's a good time.

There is a lot of randomness in the game.  I tend to shy away from random games.  Just be sure not to expect a great deal of solid strategy.  If you are willing to roll with the swings and just enjoy the concept for what it is, you'll have a lot of fun.

RATING: 8.5
Light hearted betting game. You can quite easily calculate the different probabilities for the short-horizon bets, so there is not so much to the game if played seriously. But for casual play, maybe even with children who do not recognize the proabilities so easily, this is quite some fun. The pyramid-dice-rolling mechanism is totally overproduced, but it is a nice gimmick which makes Camel Up very recognizable.

Update: Played it also with many players (7) and it still worked great. Very easy to teach, great components, good artwork, always fun: I think I like this game more than I should based on the mechanisms. 6.5 -> 7

Update 2: After more than 10 plays with different groups (also many non-gamers) I have to increase my rating once more. Camel Up! is just a extremely well designed and fun family game. The central mechanisms with the dice rolls and the stacking camels offers such different outcomes of the race, such that most of the times the result (even of a single leg) cannot be predicted with certainty. 7 -> 7.5

Update 3: After more than 20 plays, I still enjoy every single one of them. Camel up scales really well over a wide range of number of players. This is one of the best family games. It's really unique. 7.5->8

Update 4: After 25 play and with the expansion being released, Camel Up! receives another bump. Best game of 2014 for me. Worthy Spiel des Jahres winner.

Camel racing where you are betting on the outcome of legs and the final result, as well as trying to influence the outcome.  There's not much player-to-player 'gotcha' but lots of laughs as the fortunes change unexpectedly over the course.  Works well with the theme and much more depth than you'd expect because of the complicated probabilities, and yet easy to explain and play.  I can see why it won the Spiel des Jahres 2014 even though I'd have expected to see Love Letter win.

Palpites mais ou menos fundamentados e apostas certeiras, são a essência deste jogo, que é muito divertido, embora pouco estratégico. Com um tema, mecânicas e componentes muito apelativos, joga-se em poucos minutos e consegue envolver até 8 jogadores, o que são fatores que terão pesado para o triunfo do SdJ 2014, embora coloca-lo à frente de Splendor seja algo muito insólito... Aprovadíssimo!

Played 2 player. It was pretty fun and its wild how one camel you may think is completely out but then back he comes and perhaps wins it all. Would be a lot more fun with more players

Played 3 player. Tough to get serious gamers to play/take it seriously. If they do its a nice pallet cleanser

Very fun and simple betting game. Takes only a few minutes to teach. Players can evaluate the probabilities based on dice drawn, stacking of camels and desert tiles on board. It's true, there is a strong random element to the game, but in Camel Up it is couched nicely into this enjoyable, quick experience. In OUR games we tend to shout and cheer for the die result we want. Good times!

This game was a very pleasant surprise. It is very simple to learn, plays quickly, supports a wide array of player counts and most importantly, we found it to be quite fun.

RATING: 7.7
Fun for the whole family. My only complaint might be that the race seemed to short. It could have been that I played with the max player count of 8, so we had a very limited number of actions per leg and for the whole race. I'd like to try it with less players or the expansion that has the longer track.

We only play 2 player games so I was worried about this one when I ordered it. A reading of the rules before buying also had me concerned about maybe not enough depth. Turns out I am glad I bought this. There was a lot of excitement for us, we played 3 games in a row and had a lot of fun.  The betting really makes the game a blast. We were really into it - just as if we were at a live race! The artwork is fabulous with awesome components. Thumbs up, recommended!

A great family game.  The kids and I have had a lot of fun playing this game.  The rules are simple and explained very well in the rulebook.  There is a chance with the dice rolls, but the game encourages players to think through a number of possible outcomes depending on potential dice roles. In this way it has been an good introduction to chance for the kids. I expect we will play this game often.

Almost didn't purchase this game would have been a mistake "thank you Game Night you changed my mind".

07-10-2014. Rated after 3 plays apparently. Simple bidding game, with nice components. Game won "Spiel des Jahres 2014" so I wanted to try it out. 

Camel Up is a fluffy bidding game. Each camel races around the track -over several rounds- and you bet on which comes over the finish first and which is ahead at the end of the round. Thing is, camels on the same spot are stacked and camels on top of the one being moved are moved with it.

It's not bad, but I couldn't really care for it.

Elsőre nem nyűgözött le. Vannak benne jó ötletek, itt-ott mintha több is volna benne. Kicsit kilóg lefelé talán az utóbbi 10 év SdJ győztesei közül.
Az artwork viszont bámulatos, rengeteget tesz hozzá a feelinghez!
Alapvetően azért nem rossz egy játék, csak túl sokat nem szabad tőle várni. Családdal, vagy kissé lightosabban, félig-meddig party feelingben jó lehet. Határozottan előny, ha legalább 4-en vannak az asztal körül, mert úgy biztosan jobban kidomborodik a mechanika erőssége.
Ja, és óriási fun, ahogy a tevékkel egymáson átgázolva lehet előrevágtatni :D

Rájöttem, hogy nem igazán mi vagyunk a játék célközönsége. Káoszosan nagy a random faktor, bár a játékidő nem túl hosszú. Inkább eladtam, mivel kevés a hely, és egyébként sem valószínű, hogy ezek miatt sokszor előkerülne.

Brilliant little family game with a whimsical theme and a bit more strategy than some are admitting. The camel-stacking adds a surprising amount to the decision space. Given what the award has evolved into, I rate this a near perfect choice for SdJ.
Despite all the whimsy, this is NOT a game for younger kids. An understanding of basic probability is required, or there becomes a seat-order binding issue, where the person sitting to the left of the kid will win. I would argue this is a game for at least ages 10+.

Cracking family game that is an entertaining long filler for gamers as long as no one is criminally disposed to AP. Nice components and art - wrong kind of camel for the theme of course, but dromedaries presumably wouldn't stack so well, and a Mongolian theme would have required a ger rather than a pyramid for the dice shaker... A very decent betting game.

RATING: 6
Super reasonably priced at €15 for all the lovely bits you get. I had the pleasure of exploring this with a mixed group of adults and children as young as eight. A good time was had by all. The betting is a race in itself. The turns fly by with the whole game over and packed away in half an hour. There's some fun risks to take and games are close. The big plus of the game to me is that it plays up to eight and that it plays quickly with eight. The pyramid is a fun gimmick that wins the kids over. A fun family game.

It's just for fun really because the game is somewhat flawed - playing to the left of someone who favours revealing a die is a big advantage. Yet you have to respect a game that the target crowd enjoy so much.

RATING: 7
Betting game in which the players doesn't control, as in Royal Turf, the race participants, since the outcome is determined by luck. The only thing that the players control is the timing of their actions: When to bet, when to roll a dice... Still a fun game, but even so I believe that the Spiel des Jahres is too big to fit it well.

One advice: you'll have to be at least 4 to get the marvels of the game!

Fun, silly, dice rolling game. Although it's completely luck dependent, the choices available on a given turn balances this out. I must say the pyramid and the camel meeples convinced me to buy this one.

This game admittedly looks ridiculous, but it's a box full of fun. The rules are well-written and straight-forward, and the premise of the game is nice and simple: place bets on a wacky camel race, and periodically cash in (or pay out) on your bets. Most money at the end wins. 

Played this with 4 players and things worked well. I'm interested to know how the strategy changes with more or fewer players. 

The pyramid die roller seems gimmicky but it really adds to the excitement. A lot of die rolls near the end had everyone's head near the table trying to see what was coming out. 

The game is pretty balanced in that no one ever really seems out of it -- both the camels racing and the players playing. Does white look assured of last place? Not so fast, a couple of lucky rolls later and white is pushing for the win.

The game is the right length, enough that it's easy to play twice in a row without anyone getting tired of it.

Happy to have this one in my collection.

We thoroughly enjoy this betting/racing game. It's a great intro game, yet keeps gamers interested. The mechanics are quite unique, especially the pyramid dice selector and the game is well balanced even when incorporating many super cup elements which means anyone can win right up to the end. The artwork is fun and the stacking antics makes for a very fun experience each time you play. Highly recommend this sleep title.

I didn't expect this winning SdJ, but was relieved it wasn't the soulless Splendour. I didn't know what to expect, but the game pleasantly surprised me. We organised a boardgame section at a local sci-fi+fantasy convention and this game was a big hit. Looking pleasant, being easy to play, but mostly evoking a fun atmosphere. 

It's racing betting game (betting on camels) with a new gimmick of camels stacking on top of one another. While dice introduce the usual randomness (d3, btw.), it's the tiles and aggressive play of them that really turns the chaos button on. With the race being divided in legs (where each camel moves once) the game is all about timing, trying to prioritise short and long term goals and trying to detect when the tide will turn before anybody else does. I actually loved this riding on the groupthink and saying  [i]"ha, I knew this was going to happen"[/i] afterwards (of course, I predicted also other things, that didn't happen, but I get results!). 

What the game does really well is exuding a pleasant and exciting atmosphere full of laughs and some [i]"A-Ha!"[/i]s. Art is pretty much the usual somewhat cute somewhat generic German family game fare. Pyramid - yes, it's gimmicky, but actually clever in how it does help the game go along faster and smoother, so good job on user interface. Maybe the tricky part is that it's kinda gamerish - you do need to think and have plans and adapt them all the time, but you have no certainty that your planning will be rewarded. However having no plans won't win you the game either - I'm not sure if its simple enough to get that I could play it with kids. 

Now, they tell me, Winner's Circle (of which I believe there isn't a copy in the country) is a better racing betting game. I can't tell. Certainly is better than the other one I've played (Horse Fever - good core, but bad execution). It also doesn't seem like a game people will play years from now. Yet, the game allows me to use my skills of prediction and I love that. Not sure if many other games do this (?).

The first thing that comes to mind about Camel Up is that it is one overproduced game. The pyramid and pyramid tiles are totally unnecessary, but there is no denying that the set-up commands curiosity. 

Kitschy visuals aside, the stacking of camels is an interesting gimmick which can lead to hilarious upsets. There are a few meaningful decisions to be made while betting, but otherwise the gameplay teeters close to complete chaos. Not only does the value of each roll matter, but the order in which dice are revealed also counts just as much.

Something worth noting is that the decisions can occasionally feel constricted. When at least 2 dice have been rolled in an early leg, the next player will often have to decide between rolling a die or taking a betting card. Neither option is attractive because taking a betting card would be highly risky with 3 unrolled dice remaining, and rolling a die would significantly reduce the betting risks for subsequent players. If everyone at the table is playing with even a modicum of strategy, this would be an unenviable position to be in.

But there are times you want to turn your brain off and enjoy a cute gimmick in a short amount of time. Camel Up certainly fits that bill, although there are better and more substantial racing games of the same weight out there.

This game is silly fun mixed with actual strategic game elements as you try to bet on camels most likely to win/lose legs of the race and the whole shabang. The oasis/desert tiles give you some ability to try and influence events. Due to the camels stacking and moving each camel on top of them along for the ride when they move, things can get shaken up really quickly and what looked like an obvious loser could sneak in the surprise victory. And really, the game is the most fun when those longshots happen.

What seems like a racing game, which it is, is not a race in that you are betting on where camels will finish up each leg of the race and scoring points in various ways in this Euro style betting race game.  The stacking camels and multi-camel movement makes this unique.  Doing well with the overall race winner and loser can earn a chunk of bonus points.  Overall great game!

Tevék versenyeznek egy piramis körül, a játékosok nógatják őket és fogadnak rájuk, ki végez egy adott szakaszon elől, illetve az egész verseny győztesére és vesztesére. Rendkívül szépen kivitelezett játék, nagyon jó megoldás a tevék léptetése a piramissal. A játékban bár túlteng a szerencsefaktor, mégis aranyos, jó szórakozás főként, mert egy parti 15-20 perc alatt lemegy és így jöhet is a visszavágó.
Az év játéka díj erős túlzás, de az biztos, hogy szórakoztató és nagyon családbarát a játék.

1 play, 4er

This is a simple (camel-) racing, betting game. The race track is a simple ring around the board. There are 5 colored camels, with a like-colored die hidden in the over-produced (but very cool) pyramid. There's a pile of betting tiles (5, 3, 1) for each camel. Players start the game with some money coins, a +1/-1 token, and a card corresponding to each camel.

On your turn, either take a betting tile, place one of your cards on the first-place or last-place pile, place your +1/-1 token on the track (not adjacent to another such tile), or take a random die from the pyramid and roll -- that camel moves as many spaces forward (if landing on a +/-1 move +/-1 space, and that tile's owner earns 1 coin). Camels moving forward onto another space stack on top of other camels; moving backwards go underneath. After all 5 camels have moved, players earn (or pay!) money according to the positions of the camels they took betting tiles for. Then, return all betting tiles and repeat.

The game ends when a camel crosses the finish line. Then, reveal all cards on the first- and last- place piles. Players who correctly predicted first/last place earn (or pay) additional money; earlier betters get paid better. The player with the most money wins.

So how was it? Lame. There is so little control that the game feels almost totally random. It's not completely random, of course; and it was sort of fun. But there are just so many better racing games out there!

On paper looks like my sort of game, in practice it fell flat as a camel poo and was played with the right crowd. Lovely bits and the pyramid is a feature.Need to play again but if I had to chose between this or Winner's circle the Camel comes last. I'm not the market for this game though - probably best played by familys or teens (or my wife who liked it).

After 2nd play it lacks an X factor that did rolling betting games should have - maybe because it's not too difficult to calculate likely results.

3rd play wand I must be missing something. It looks lovely, the dice pyramid is a hoot - game play is lame, no matter how much hollering and whooping you add to each die roll.

4th play. This really is poor. That or i am turning into a game grouch.

RATING: 9
I was looking for a fun (not just heads-down, deep-thinking), relatively short (30-45 minutes), interactive, simple game for up to eight players and came across Camel Up. After playing for the third time in one evening with our gaming cohorts, my wife said, "This is the most fun we've had with any game we've played in quite a while!" And I completely agree. It is witty, it is exciting, it is strategic, it is filled with luck, and it's a blast. 

There are five camels racing around the track. Each player is a bettor. One of four actions can be taken each turn: roll a die to move a camel, bet on the winner of that leg, place your oasis/mirage tile, or bet on the overall race winner/loser. That's it...but there is oh, so much more! This is my favorite aspect of the entire game: if a camel lands on the space of another camel, the moving camel is stacked on top of the other and is then higher ranked than the first. If the camel at the bottom of a stack is moved, all camels on top of that camel move with it and remain ahead of the moving camel. If you think about it, there is a lot that this implies. It muddies up the relatively simple betting world and adds an incredibly fun twist. If a camel lands on an oasis tile, the player who laid the tile gets an Egyptian Pound (have the most at the end of the game to win), and the camel moves forward one space (and takes the lead if stacked). However, a mirage tile will move the camel back a space and underneath any existing camels. Use these tiles carefully to pull in a good stream of earnings while furthering or hindering camels depending on your bets.  

Another really cool feature of Camel Up is the die-rolling pyramid. You put all five dice inside this pyramid at the beginning of each leg. When a player chooses to move a camel for his action, he takes the pyramid, gives it a little shake, flips it upside down, pushes the slider which only allows space enough for a single die to be released, then lifts it up to reveal the die. My 10-year-old nephew rolled almost every time because he thought it was so fun just to use the pyramid.   

The most fun comes when all eggs are placed in one basket, someone flips over the pyramid to roll a die, everyone is muttering something like, "Come on...come on...yellow 2...yellow 2...," followed by yells of success or groans of failure. =-) It is a very fun game which I give a solid 8.5.

Another game that I was extremely skeptical about. Played it a few times this weekend and have not had this much fun and laughter in a while. Gamers and non-gamers alike will enjoy this game.

I love how no matter how far ahead or behind a camel might be, you never truly know where it will end up by the end. Stacked camels and desert tiles lead to some seriously wacky endings. We were literally jumping up and cheering by the end of the game.

Highly recommended.

Oh, also the pyramid dice roller is life. Best gimmick ever.

This is one of the games that I fail to understand the popularity of.  Is it that people are sold on the cute little camel meeples?  The way that you stack them?  The gimmicky pyramid used for rolling the dice?

I gave this game to my nephew for his birthday, and while it seems to be a tad too complex for him at the moment, I really liked it when I played it with my sister and her fiancé. The fact that it's light, but still has some reasonably deep strategy to it, and plays up to 8, made it very attractive indeed! I put it on my wishlist and wouldn't you know it, my BGG Secret Santa for 2016 delivered!

Thank you Santa!

Update 2017-10-06: Adjusted rating. It's a game I'm happy to have on my shelf, since it's very easy to play with beginners, and plays with up to 8. But it's not a game I typically play with gamer friends.

A decnet betting and racing game, but I'd rather play Royal Turf or Top Race. The pyramid die roller is a nice gimmick, but I'm still a bit surprised this won the Spiel des Jahres. The weakest winner in a long time, IMHO.

I don't put much stock in BGG rankings or various gaming awards, but in this case, the Spiel des Jahres has definitely picked a winner.  (I certainly can't think of a better family game for teaching children about the fun and rewarding experience that gambling provides!)  It's a very clever game centred around a very clever mechanism that is implemented using the brilliant dice pyramid.  The camels and all other components are well done too, and the game play is very simple and a lot of fun.  I particularly appreciate how the overall race is broken down into "legs", yet it all plays out quite quickly.  Luck is a factor as it is with any form of gambling, but the design is tight and it really is a good betting game.  The only real negative comment I can make is that, despite the fact that the game plays 2-8 players, I can see some game play problems cropping up outside the 3-5 players range (though my only plays so far have been 4-player games).  I give this game two humps up.  Game design: 4.5/5  Personal enjoyment: 3.5/5  Total: 8/10

Was viewed with some suspicion as some of the players had heard it was a light family game.  After 2 games everyone was enjoying it, after the insanity of the camel in last place after the 1st and 2nd legs rushing through to win.

RATING: 4
Players bet on camels racing around a track. A camel landing on a space where one already sits will land on top of it; the camel below will carry it if it moves subsequently. Each camel moves according to a die roll, with dice drawn in random order -- the result is that even a camel quite far behind may be able to race into first if it lands on another camel which then moves itself.

We played this immediately after Colt Express and the comparison is striking: Colt Express is chaotic, but the chaos is player-driven and there is a lot of fun in seeing clever schemes succeed or, more likely, fall apart. Camel Up, by contrast, is ultimately about betting on random dice rolls, and while there is some amusement at seeing a heavily-invested player losing bigtime it seems not to either their credit or disgrace. It's definitely got its moments, but most of the complexity (different kinds of betting, tiles to help/hinder camels) reads to me as providing decisions with the veneer of meaning but not its substance.

That offends me far more than a game with a similar level of randomness which does not pretend to be something that it isn't.

GET HYPE! ROLL SOME DICE! BET ON A CAMEL! THIS IS IT! THIS IS THE BIG ONE! ONE OF YOUR FRIENDS PLACES A MIRAGE TILE NEXT TO THE CLUMP OF CAMEL! ROLL A ONE! YOUR CAMEL IS NOW 4TH! WOW, GET WRECKED NERD!

It's fun with light probability but often, the choice of what to bet on is pretty much already made for you. I like that it plays at higher player counts. It also features one of the most well-written rulebooks I've ever gone through. Very simple and easy to follow.

In my first game, I made every possible mistake imaginable. However, that didn't stop me from doing quite well. I was in the running the whole time and might have won if another player hadn't guessed both the ultimate winner and loser way back at the beginning of the race. I love how the game changes constantly and unpredictably while enticing folks to calculate odds at the same time.

I played this game 8 times in a few months. That's remarkable. I get why people say this is an easy game with a luck-factor, but people laughed every time this game was on the table. I also have the feeling there is some tactics and even strategy possible. So if you are looking for a fun game for a broad audience, playable with 2-8 (!) in less than an hour, just above the category "silly", buy this. I'll end with congrats to those in charge of streamlining and printing the rules, good work.

Reminds me of Backgammon. Sure there's luck, but navigating the luck is the fun. Theme is great and humorous. Whole family loves this one.

I wouldn't call this game "simple", as calculating odds can be fairly involved. They aren't large numbers, but figuring remaining dice into the camel positions, not to mention the X factor of available desert tiles... 

There's a serious gambling game here if people want to add a pot to it.

Quick playing race game where players have to bet on camels. The race is made up of five camels of different colours. On their turn players can perform one of a number of actions; either bet which camel will win a leg of the race (completed once all the camels have moved), bet which camel will win or come last in the overall race, place a tile that if landed on means the camels either move forward or backwards, or move the camels one to three spaces by using the dice from an upturned pyramid, which acts as a dice tower. The one original feature is that camels on the same space move together in a stack, so a camel on top of others has an advantage by being moved during the other camels' movements as well as its own. Whoever predicted winners/loser the best receives money (VPs) and whoever predicted wrongly has to pay. This game is more than a little mad and is certainly fun to play but I don't think it is as good as its Spiel des Jahres win would suggest and it is often over far too quickly.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Plays very well with the easy to learn rules, but with the betting on the camels making it a fairly tense game. With you hoping that you've bet on the right camel,during the race and then for the end results. Highly recommend it to get non-gamers into games. (16/07/17)

Ever since [thing=40237][/thing], I know that horse racing games can be fun for me. Most of them I don't enjoy, but I'm always willing to give them a shot. Even if they're themed to camels, not horses. This one involves a weird contraption shaped like a pyramid that you have to turn upside down to get a die from. I guess a drawbag and a die roll wasn't interesting enough.
Other than the fact that they're both racing and bidding games, there is not too much Camel Up and Long Shot have in common. This one is lighter and gives players less control over what happens.
I found that this game doesn't really work well with strategic players. I think it'll work better with families with kids. The problem is that the first turns every round you don't have any information to go on, so the only good move is to get a die. But after 2 or 3 dice, the next die will give away a lot of information, helping the player after the one drawing that die. So when that is you, you will have to either have a big chance of giving away the round to the next player (or at least helping in a significant way) or having to do something else, which will result in you taking a risk, which often is a crashoot. Which is why I feel this game doesn't work with strategic players who take notice of percentages of chances of things happening and stuff like that.

Egyből Knizia teknősös játéka ugrott be róla :) Ezt annak a felturbózott változatának érzem.

Esélylatolgatás, aki bátrabb és jól tippel az nyer. A kérdés, ki milyen hamar mer tippelni a tevékre: öt lehetőség van, már csak négy vagy ha már csak kettő? Minél később tippelsz annál biztosabb hogy eltalálod, viszont annál kisebb az esélye, hogy magas pontszámokat kapsz. Persze kell hozzá logika, de azt mindenki végi tudja játszani, szóval ezzel nem tehetsz szert előnyre. Szerencsejáték a javából.

Camel Up (or is it Camel Cup?) is much more thoughtful than I anticipated. It is a type of horse (camel) racing game where the players are all attempting to pick the winners, both of individual legs of a race as well as the overall race. They can also try to manipulate the order of the camels in the race to a small degree. Fascinatingly, camels can stack and carry others along for a ride. This throws an interesting wrinkle into an otherwise straightforward race.

The game plays quickly, and it rides the line between giving the players too much knowledge about which camel is going to win (which would create an exercise in pure calculation) and no information at all (which would create a game of pure luck). In other words, there is just enough to keep things interesting. It is a worthy SdJ nomination with whimsical components. Played with a group in the mood for a bit of raucous fun, Camel Up even manages to transcend its roots as a family game and push into something party-worthy.

The components in this game are beautiful and interesting and work really well with the theme. The Pyramid dice roller is a fun gimmick and the camel stacking also adds to the hilarity of play. It sometimes feels as though the game is too random and unpredictable and optimal plays cannot be determined (eg I suck at this game!) but at the same time it doesn't matter. It adds to the theme of bidding and pushes you to either go all or nothing or try your best to cover your bases. It is a good length, games never feel too long and rarely too short but has great replay value.

I'm rating Camel Up a 7.2 for the fact that it is a very solid game that is always a fun play. This game is one of the few that I have found that really supports a group of 8 well without slowing down. There is plenty of strategy to this game for those who want to analyze but I've also introduced this game to players as young as 7 and 8 who have had a blast due to the fun components and dice randomness. The last two times we have played we ended up standing and yelling as the final few dice were let out of the pyramid, and this game has been a hit with every group I've introduced it to. If you are looking for a fun family game that takes about 10 minutes to explain this is the one. Absolutely pick this up, another winner for Z-Man Games.

I am honestly not sure if this game could be more perfect for its intended purpose. It has a mix of skill and luck. It is just a crazy and dynamic game full of surprises every time. I can see how a veteran gamer wouldn't like it as much (you can lose to a new player because of luck). However, if you don't really care that much about winning and just wanna have fun in a creative betting game, this is the game to play. Camel Up is one of my favorites to end a game day.

This is a kids game and I have rated it as such.  For a kids game it's a solid 7.  I don't really understand the adult love for this game though.  Soooo if you are looking for a game with the kids, GREAT go for it, but if you want a simple gateway to introduce people to modern gaming, find something better.

This is a great casual game, The stacking camels make the tables turn so quickly so that an underdog comes back and people are rushing to make new bets! Works best if every one is playing quick and dirty without too much analyzation. Everyone I have played this with has enjoyed it.

[thing=153938][/thing] is a fun game, and it is pretty easy to learn: in your turn you have 4 things to do and you can do only one of them:
a) take a pyramid tile (is worth 1 money at the end of the leg) and roll the movement die for one of the camels;
b) take a bet tile for the leg (each is worth different: the first is worth 5, the second 3 and the third 2 money - so, the sooner you take them, the best is the reward, but if the camel you choose didn't finish the leg at least in second place, you lose 1 money. If the camel you pick a tile for finish in second, you get 1 money, no matter which tile you took). There are only three for each camel;
c) place a bet for the overall winner or the overall loser of the camels (it is allowed to place more than one bet of each type, but you will lose 1 money for each bet wrong). You place these bets hidden, but the cards must remain in the order they were put, since, in the end, the first player to bid in the correct winner or loser will gain 8 money, then, in order, 5, 3, 2 and 1 money;
d) place the tile of dry land (-1 movement) or oasis (+1 movement) in one spot in the race track. Everytime a camel step on your tile you gain 1 money.

If a camel enters in the same spot of other camel, it climbs on its back, and is considered to be ahead of the camel bellow it. If a camel bellow others move, it takes with him all camels above him. This is the key idea that drives the whole game. A leg lasts until the die for each camel has been rolled. After this, all bets tiles pay their rewards (or demand their penalties), each pyramid tile pays 1 money, and than a new leg starts. The game ends immediately when the first camel cross the finish line of the track. This is basically the all the game - easy, right?

I didn't like at all how the leg bets work - usually, after someone rolled a die, became obvious the one or two camels that would win the leg, so everyone else took the tiles of the bets, and when the game returned to the player that rolled the die, all the tiles for a given camel were taken. This happened in all the legs, in more or less severe ways. Sure, it could be because of how the camels started and the first ones to move were the ones ahead, so the "climbing" didn't happen as often as it could have been. I can imagine this, but I didn't saw this.

On the other hand, how the bets for the overall winner and loser I liked quite a bit - easy and tense at the same time, and since you can do more than one bet in both, even if your first one seems that won't pay out, you can place another bet (you will still lose one money for failed bet, but you can gain up to 8 for being the first to do the correct bet), and bidding on the loser camel was also a good addition. [thing=153938][/thing] is indeed mostly all about luck, however, it is also short enough for this didn't bother me at all.

The pieces are great and this will probably be a sure bet (a-ha) for a family game, as it is colorful, easy to teach and to play, with some minimal depth, making even the little ones a challenge in the game, and if they aren't, they will probably still have fun rolling the dice in the pyramid, ando also moving and stacking the camels. And, for those wandering, I think [thing=148228][/thing] is a better game, but is much drier and can't hold the 5 or 6 players that [thing=153938][/thing] can (but, more players in the game = bigger role for luck).

I like the game because, it is easy to explain to others, it plays fast and people seem to enjoy it a lot. It can be a little bit unfair for the one who decides to move the camels compared with the one who takes the bed tokens, especially when you play with a larger group. However, the game brings a lot of excitement and fun. I replayed it a number of times.

This is an interesting one.  It's fun watching the camels race around and rooting for the camels you bet on.  The giant pyramid that they included is completely unnecessary but it's cool I suppose.  It almost feels too short, which is something that I rarely complain about.  It's fun if you enjoy figuring out probabilities, and you don't mind a game with a lot of randomness.

What can I complain about a Spiel des Jahres winner? Camel Up is a fast bidding game. When you think that you know all about the game, it becomes so chaotic that you miss all your bids. The game is chaotic in a good way.
If you play with more than 5 players, we can see some problems in the game, because some players will rarely get a chance to bid in one row.

Camel Up is a perfect example of why family games are awarded the SDJ and they often don't agree with BGG gamers. In reading the rule book, it is clear that the game is simple, straightforward and not burdened by complexity. Yet, behind the simple rule set is a more subtle but distinct strategy of risk-taking.

Yes, the heart of Camel Up is a racing game that involves dice and betting. However, the game play also provides ample time and space for smart play and calculated risk taking. For example, deciding when to play the desert/mirage tile allows you to help "surge" the camel of your choice ahead of the pack. Also, how the camel positions can easily change order.

 Strategies can backfire with poor die rolls, but it can be balanced with educated guesses and pondering probabilities...if you choose to do so. Some folks will certainly enjoy thinking about how to maximize risk taking while others will just enjoy using the inverted pyramid for rolling dice. Whether you choose one path or another, fun can be had by all. 

No, Camel Up won't win the IGA or DSP awards. But boy, this game sure hit the nail on its head with regards to being and SDJ winner. Kudos to

in combination with the supercup expansion the perfect game. I love everything about this game. Everything is almost completely unpredictable and the races are almost always very close.
You make bets on the camels participating in the race in order to win the most money. There are a lot of possibilities to make a bet, such as predicting the winner of the "stage", bet for the second, third, etc., bet for the winner and loser for the whole race, you can influence the racing court etc... a lot of possibilities
the only negative aspect is the quite high downtime with many players.

When I first saw this game I couldn't understand how it was so well received.  When I played it for the first time, the experience wasn't enjoyable, but I could instantly see the potential.

After purchasing it for myself and hauling it around during a family vacation, I'm addicted.  Great fun in a short amount of time.  The beauty is in the moments where you're saying, "Okay, the only thing that could screw over all of my plans and bets right now is if a Blue 2 die comes  out."  And then it does! Much cheering and laughing.  The game is many of those  moments.

My adoration of this game continues to climb the more random group of people I break it out to.  I've played it at all kinds of situations, with all types of gamers, and it's just good clean fun having a group of people all cheering and jeering as a die pops out of the bottom.

It's just too great when everyone is debating odds and then you look at that Blue Camel trailing in the very back by 7 spaces and say, "Wouldn't it be great if Blue rolled a 3 and landed on that Oasis which put him on Orange, and then Orange rolled a 3 and suddenly Blue is winning?  Then someone takes that insane longshot bid, AND IT HAPPENS!"

First opened at a campsite outside Bath, the rain was hammering down outside our little DIY canvas shelter. Expectations from the faces around me were very apprehensive but after 2 rounds we were all into our camel gambling personas.

The best thing about this game is the random nature of the outcome. Throughout the entire game Orange trailed - no winning bets were placed on it aside from the last to finish bid... the last two rolls saw this rocky-esque tango'd hero jump onto a cluster of camels only to depart at the last second to win by a nose length.

Swearing, cajoling and huge amounts of laughter were had - the exact ingredients for a brilliant gaming night... we even forgot it was raining!

It's definitely fun, at least the first 2-3 times that you try it with a new group of players. But after that I think that you will lose interest. The game can be played from 2-8 players but in my opinion it should not be even tried with more than 5 players as you don't have any power over the outcome of the race. It is a good family game but I would expect something more from a game with the Spiel des Jahres. The components (especially the pyramid) are great.

Camel Up is a horse race gambling game (except with camels, duh) that turns the usual formula on its head. Players bet through the different legs of each race, trying to predict which camel will finish in the lead. The trick is that when two or more camels are on the same space, they stack. The last one to arrive goes on top of the pile, and in a twist, is considered to be the leader.

All of this is almost completely random, yet it is interesting because you can almost calculate the odds for any given bet...but not quite, due to that unique stacking mechanic. In the biggest twist of all, anytime a camel at a lower position in the stack moves, it carries the camels on top of it. This creates a myriad of possibilities in each move and makes the wagering a real puzzle.

Again, it's completely random but just predictable enough to give the illusion of consistency to the players. This drives the betting and makes every turn have an agonizing decision, that usually doesn't work out for you, no matter how well you play the odds.

It's silly...and absolutely brilliant.

I bought this as a family game and unfortunately didn't go well. For some reason the rules didn't quite click with two groups and they found it confusing. Is it the game it was it me being a bad game explainer ;)

RATING: 8
I'm very calculative and have a group of very like-minded friends, and we really love playing this game. The fact that we roughly calculate our chances of each camel winning and knowing who's taking what kind of odds makes it an even funnier experience when the most unexpected outcome does happen (it happens often!).

Another disappointing SdJ.
Almost no control on what's happening. Useless gimmicky pyramid.
I heard comparisons with Royal Turf. Well, THAT's a great race game with bets and 1K times better than this.
I dont need to be highly strategic but here really you are just betting on nothing concrete

Light gateway game with a high luck factor, in which you gamble on a camel race. Won Spiel des Jahres in 2014 because of its breezy and funny theme and artwork. Fun for dessert after a longer game, but loses its charm a little bit after a few plays.

The pyramid-dice-throwing-thing gave the game some theme. But I didnt really enjoy it. There was a lack of options and a bit too much luck involved.

My first racing and betting game, at first I was concerned it may be too light and cartoony, but boy was I wrong. There's risk management, avoidance and mitigation! I love it and I think my groups will too.

RATING: 7.5
Seems like utter chaos but this game is surprisingly strategic if you give it some thought. Or you can just enjoy how it looks on the table. TIPS: (1) rolling is generally your worst move; it just gives information to the rest of the table with very little return, (2) Use the oasis tile and don't forget that you use can take another turn to move or flip your tile even if it has already been placed.

Camel Up is one of those games that easily gets played more than once in one sitting. It's quick, it's exciting, and the more players the more fun. It's light, and ultimately it's all luck based, but as a more board game-y party game, this is one of the best party games you can find.

Only a few games in, but it brings a pretty big riot around the table. Lots of laughter with this one.

If you're looking for something strategic, steer clear. This was made for simple, lighthearted fun...and it accomplishes this brilliantly.

It's a neat simple game, which can be fun with the right crowd and even works with a large number of players. But it is kind of random and swingy (which is part of its charm). I'm glad to own it, but this is not the first game i would pull out to play.

Situational luck and gambling against the other players, however the most crucial part of the game is the move backwards tiles as it adds exceptional variance to the chances of everything.

RATING: 7
Simple game, gives me a bit of a party-game vibe to me. This game requires almost no rules explanation, so it's easy to get to the table with non-gamers. Heavy game lovers might find the gambling aspect that is the core value proposition of this game too random, as you have to take quite some risks based on sparse information. I can totally imagine people not liking that.

I however don't mind it too much. I like to get a bit silly with the game and don't take things to seriously. I prefer to play multiple rounds and tally the money gained and announce a winner after X number of games.

I was surprised by this game. Overly simple to play betting game. Admittedly all dice controlled, yet it's still fun. I snatched up the expansion (super cup) because the more I played this game, the more I fell in love with it. No other game makes me LOVE gambling quite like this gem. My only minor complaint is that the rubber band on the dice pyramid breaks after awhile, but rubber bands are relatively easy to come by. Bet on the race, bet on the leg of the race (all camel dice rolled), move the race, fix a bet. It's all so simple and flows so perfectly.

Fun game, but I wouldn't recommend playing it with 2,3 or 7,8 players. 2-3 game does by pretty quickly and you will most likely make the same dicisions. 7-8 players is the totally opposite you can make less influence

This was a neat twist on a racing game... as you aren't in control of a particular camel... you are just betting on the outcome of legs of the race.  The Pyramid die roller thing is really cool... the risk/reward of betting early vs waiting to see how things play out is fun.  A really good family style game!

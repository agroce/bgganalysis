A very detailed look at small unit engagements in N. Africa. Uses unit rosters to track individual loses!

Love the programed rules that build in complexity. Quick games with few counters in the form of "firefights" are a nice bonus.
Cool to add the variant counters from the General for more options in DYO scenarios. The errata amends some of the damage charts so a must have.
Lots to explore for the N. Africa campaign student.
 
If you don't mind rolling lots of dice this is a fantastic game. Easy to house rule for fewer shots justified by the confusion and chaos of battle. 
(If you do mind then check out 88 of the Panzer family, which is similar in scale but not so many dice rolls.)

In some ways, this reminds of [thing=1589][/thing] for tanks.  There are no SSDs or anything like that, but it is a detailed look at tactical armored battles.  It has a reputation for being overly complex, but it has programmed instruction, so the game is as complicated as you want it to be.  Is it over the top?  Probably, but I haven't got there, yet.
You can tell that the designer did a tremendous amount of research as various types of armament are analyzed against various targets.  The game has a lot of die rolling.  But in its defense, I think it does a lot better job at what its trying to do than, say, [thing=2238][/thing].
It hasn't aged so gracefully -- neither have I.  It might be one of those games that you really dug back in the 70s, but can't seem to find the time to ever pull it down now, and maybe it's been surpassed by newer designs, but I still have much respect for what the designer was trying to accomplish and the final product.

Tobruk had a tremendously huge impact on my 10 year old self when it first came out -
 not really so much as a game but as a concept of modeling WWII AFV combat (a classic "design for cause" simulation) that has fascinated me ever since. The research behind, and the writing in, the rulebook still ranks as one of the finest pieces of work ever in wargaming. The stuff Avalon Hill put out in its heyday was of of the utmost professional quality, perfectly exemplified here in Hal Hock's work. This is what ignited my interest in the hobby and in the intervening four decades precious few works from a research and writing perspective measure up to it...

I can't imagine playing it now, but in its day this game rocked.  Resolving the impact of each shell and tracking the fate of each infantry soldier were amazing board game concepts back then.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I still have this oldie.  I think it's underrated.  It acutally feels more like a micro miniatures wargame than a board game.  Hit resolution is quite detailed and you can pull off some cool tank tactics.  Of coures the desert boards are boring, it's North Africa.  Worth a play if you get a chance.  You can pick them up pretty cheaply even these days.  I'd gladly still play this one.

I took one look at some of the gunnery tables and gaped at the rate of fire of some of the weapons...I immediately began using EXCEL to come up with probability tables so as to resolve the outcome of these weapons with their ridiculously high rates of fire in one dice roll...and promptly lost interest somewhere along the line.  I might return to completing these tables when I have time.  On the surface...a curious land based wargame...no real terrain except for wrecked vehicles and some dust kicked up by the vehicles.

There was a time in the 70s where the Squad Leader and Tobruk players were at loggerheads on which was the better tactical game system.  The SL players did not like the more complex Tobruk with the gun charts and the squad paperwork.  The Tobruk players felt that SL was too vanilla especially on how it portrayed armor.  If you are into North African tank battles I very highly recommend this game. Its not nearly as complex as some think.  The chart look up for tank hits is handled well and its actually pretty intense. The charts handle hit location, ammo type, critical hits, etc.. in exacting measure. The counters are functional, the board...well lets just say its sparse leave it at that. The scenarios are interesting. The 88 is king in this game, and the Italian M13/40 a death trap.  This IS a good game.  Ironic that ASL is now 100 times as complex as Tobruk ever was.

In some ways, a progenitor of Squad Leader, but a "design for cause" rather than "effect". Excessive dice rolling (Do I hit the target, where, how, is it damaged, is it on fire, etc) and book-keeping (units take individual losses of men tracked via a roster sheet). Also hard to vary the scenarios with NO terrain (except trenches, bunkers, etc). My first ever wargame.

Bookkeeping and multiple die rolls for every little battlefield event kill the action here. It is ridiculously detail-oriented and playing it is toil.

There's no terrain. This was by design. Let that be a lesson, future game-designers.

When this game came out some of the game designers at SPI tried to play it and just hated it. It tries SO HARD to be a simulation, as if tracking every bullet makes for a simulation, must less a game. And the map - the MAP! - the most boring ever. A must to avoid - in my humble opinion.

RATING: 5
This was the first real boardgame to take a miniatures approach and it seemed at the time it was published to be the most realistic tactical game ever made.  Tons of detail--each and every tank shell was diced for when fired.  Problem was that there was too much dice rolling.  Second problem was that the terrain was flat as a billiard table; maybe that well represented the terrain in the Gazala area, but it also was frustrating that there weren't any options to incorporate any.  Inspired many other games that took a miniatures approach, and not only armor games, but particularly naval games.  Well crafted and beautifully produced, but now mostly appeals only to those with an Operations Research/Operations Analysis bent.  "C'est magnifique, mais ce n'est pas de guerre!"

RATING: 4
Picked it up a long time ago when it first came out.  It has a boring orange board that is supposed to be the desert.  It also has small counters and hexes that don't make me want to play it either.  My memories are that keeping track of infantry was a drag but the tank and weapon charts were awesome.  Many of the scenarios were too big to ever be played with the amount of bookkeeping required by the system (at least by me).  However for a fairly small tank battle it's cool.  It just always felt more like a handful of charts than a complete game.  Having said that I have to admit tactical isn't my favorite scale and my bias my be showing here.

Fantastic wargame with deeeep detail that models tank to tank combat in a span under one year in North Africa and it can be learned and played to completion in < 3 hours no problem.

The game uses a set of charts particular to 'each' weapon type versus it's target (down to the particular angle/ascpect of the impact).  THIS allows a level of realism not possible in 99% of other wargames.  Each roll of the dice is literally on shot from the tank's main gun.

Rules are NOT too complex for a *wargame* and the programed system allows you to start playing in < 30 min.  What more do you want?!?  (wah! no trees in the Sahara desert!  If you add trees it would make this a "fantasy" game!  lol! )

[edit June 2015] Running this at a convention soon and played several games solo to refresh myself...damn fine tactical game with very clean rules for armor.  Infantry rules are really only "okay" but they actually work fine considering how rare and (honestly) unimportant infantry are in most of these scenarios.  It is a real shame this is the only game this designer did as I would love to see what they could do with a full blown WW2 miniatures game system.

A great and focused WWII tactical game.  When I first opened the box I thought I would hate it. Heavy rules, and a lot of charts and rosters that made my head hurt.

After reading the rules and my first game I was hooked--I fell in love. Played many, many enjoyable and exciting games afterwards. 

Some people have complained about the maps--I really like the blank maps.  I always felt it was just me and the enemy with just our wits between us when I played.

After about 5 plays and I enjoy it. Once you can navigate the charts it hums along nicely.

There are a few warts, (No acquisition counters, record keeping) but it wouldn't take much to bring it up to par.

I don't mind programmed instruction, but if this was a modern game I would ding it hard for not having the charts and a complete summary in the book. While it may make it easier to learn a game, it is a pain when you want to look something up.

Used to enjoy this game somewhat before the advent of Squad Leader. The tedious accounting of every single shell fired bogged this game down to a glacial pace. The combat system would be good as a computer game engine. Between human players, it's just horrifyingly boring.

I loved this as a kid and it launched my interest in wargaming.  This game had plenty of innovative elements, from its armor system to including morale in its infantry system.

While the armor system became unplayable in the game's larger scenarios, the detail included was engaging if the scenario didn't get too large.  The infantry rules were similar--firepower was detailed enough that it mattered many men in a unit were functioning and how close the enemy was.  Yet, tracking an entire company of units at this level proved well, fiddly to a fault, even for a wargame.  

To be better, this game would have to stick with smaller engagements, or abstract a little in favor of playability--a move I think Critical Hit has successfully made with the ATS series.

I'd say, in its day it was an 8, today it would be a 5 or so for so much wristage and lack of terrain variety...so I'll rate it somewhere in the middle.

RATING: 6
Drab map, drab counters, drab box, but a great game in it's time!  If you can get past the ugliness of Tobruk's presentation (not much eye candy here), you'll find a great game.  Tobruk is tactical, tank-to-tank combat in North Africa 1941.  While this one's out of print, its successor, Advanced Tobruk by Critical Hit is available and thriving.

Um.  I tried this many times and failed to enjoy it.  I gakked at two concepts that I couldn't get through to my head.  The first was that the desert has very very little terrain; maneuvering speed was critical but not cover.  The second was the ENORMOUS number of dice rolling; targeting, hitting, hit location to turret or chassis, penetration, and damage.  For each weapon attack.  For each attacking unit!  Gakk!

I didn't buy Panzerblitz or Panzer Leader when they were the popular games during their times.  But I bought this one - Tobruk.  Tactical tank battles doesn't interest me because of its complexity to me when I was much younger.  Nowadays, the system was further expanded by an excellent guy called Ray Taipo and turned it into "Advanced Tobruk System" (ATS).  Tank battles/ duels have never been so fun and at the same time realistic.  ATS has its own every self-contained historical modules.  So if you have time, go back and re-visit this classic game and model when it first appeared almost 30 years ago.

Played for the first time in 2009. Insane amount of dierolling, and lots of stuff to look up. But... it works and emphasizes good tactics, and I've just come to hate tactical systems like Panzer Grenadier that flatten out tankcombat capabilities to make situations more interesting to play.  Don't want to play this all the time, but I can see coming back to this.

Major weakness is the lack of soft factors but the short engagements covered mean that that's acceptable.  You wouldn't try to use this system to cover a large battle - it's best for the short, sharp firefight phase.  The open tank engagements also result in weird strategy due to the "edge of the desert" phenomenon.  Still, fun to play.

This is a part of the Second World War that holds quite a fascination for me, largely because of the Australian connection (Tobruk held out for nine months in 1941 when defended by the Ninth Australian Division and a brigade of the Seventh Division (plus British tankers and gunners), in contrast to what happened as a result of the Gazala offensive depicted in the game).

I love (but also hate) the detail of this game:  knowing exactly how many shots a Bofors AA gun can fire in AT mode, and the precise chance it has of penetrating the side armour of a PzIII H at a certain range is really interesting.  But actually rolling that many dice is not.

The scale does not work for me:  too few hexes per turn for tanks, and the infantry feels like it is crawling (which it probably was).

I think of this game as a victim of its commitment to precision and accuracy.  But not (in my experience) much fun to play.

Bearing in mind my love for ASL, this looks really weak as a game in comparison to the sublime elegance of that system.

RATING: 6
Played many many years ago. LOTS of charts and die rolls to determine every little thing. Detailed but very long and tedious at times. I believe comba resolution was something along the lines of...

"Ok, Im taking a shot at you here, distance of 8 hexes, hull down. Let me roll to see if it hit...Ok it's good. It's a flanking shot, so we need to check on the deflection value of the armor...now which part of the tank did it hit?...ok got it. Now its a HE round so damage is 1.5 times the base value so we'll use column B except we shift two columns over because you moved on your turn. Ok. So i cause damage on a roll of 9+. HA! got a 10. Ok now check the damage chart. Let's see... this area was damaged before, so there is a 25% chance of a critical hit. Oh and it's a Tuesday so we have to check on the fatigue level of the mechanics who worked on this area the day before..."

Cool tactical wargame.  The mapboard is devoid of any terrain markers so this helps beginners who may not understand the need to use the terrain to their advantage (Panzer Leader for example).  Even so, it is not an easy game to teach beginners - it is for serious war gamers.

Pretty interesting miniatures-like tactical system for the time, and I liked that it seemed to give infantry its due. Fairly detailed gunnery rules and tables. I played it a lot back when I was growing up, but I wouldn't want to play a tactical system with so much detail nowadays. Tons of dice rolling. Much more dice rolling for just gunnery than even ASL, and far more than, say, Panzer, which has a quick hit/ penetration process, while still retaining a lot of detail.

RATING: 7
Just received this classic. I really like the programmed instructions format so I don't have to read and memorize 25 pages of rules at once. The basic mechanics (for scenario one at least) are interesting and easy to handle (especially for a semi-experienced grognard like myself). The mapboard is uninteresting (reflecting the desert setting, I suppose), but the counters are nicely done, especially for a 30 year old game.

RATING: 7.25
Played first scenario.  Lots of action and combat with plentry of die rolling!  System seems manageable and fun so far.  Some AFVs can't be hit virtually at all when attacked from the front, and moving prevents a unit from firing.  After playing 3 scenarios, I think the game system is good, but the scenarios need much to be desired; very unbalanced and virtually unplayable.  They spent so much time on the combat system, why not invest some time into playtesting the scenarios?

My second wargame after Napoleon and I played it to death. In the end I found that huge, tottering stacks of tanks were the best as thre was no stacking limitations in the desert and you were assured of a break-through while avoiding most of the defensive AT by attacking one hex to one side. I sold it after a few years.

Think of it more as a pencil and paper simulation rather than a game. It is does the first wonderfully at the cost of game play. Very realistic, but could have used some abstraction to help gameplay. For example, some guns have a very high rate of fire, requiring multiple die roles and chart checks to resolve combat, which gets tedious. Excellent rules.

My very first wargame I purchased when a freshman in college. Oh how I loved this game then, driving my roommate absolutely crazy with frequent requests for gaming sessions. Tobruk was one of the first games that really took a look at tactical combat in an incredibly realistic fashion. It also gave me what I had been wanting in a wargame, the chance to drive a tank into combat under historical conditions and see how it would perform. Lots of dice rolling, I can't remember how many shots a Bofors 40mm could get off in a minute, but it was a lot, with corresponding dice rolls on the enemy to see where the shells hit. The incorporation of infantry was pretty clumsy with lots of record keeping - you had to track each man as he went down, and any surviving Germans would always go right to the MG34 where the last casualty dropped it, but the tank battles were so much fun. Introducing non-wargamers into the fold was as simple as letting them man a few Matildas and charging them with a horde of Italian M13/40's. Critical Hits version, which I also own, plays a lot simpler, but Tobruk will always occupy a treasured niche in my memory.

[BGCOLOR=#FF3300][COLOR=#FFFFFF]Wargame.[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR]  Tactical. Probably my favorite wargame that I played with my Dad when I was a kid. Lots of replayability with different unit types, loved the tactical scale and variation in weapon/armor capabilities. Fell in love with the 88mm gun :)

I can't believe this is only rated 5.94. If I had a reliable wargame partner, I'd be tempted to check out the Advanced Tobruk System.

RATING: 6.5
WWII armored miniatures battles set in North Africa. The only thing is that you play it with cardboard counters and hex maps. With a little effort, you could use the components for actual minis battles. I wasn't intimidated by the game having had some miniatures experience, and my friends and I had a good time with this game, often transferring it over to other game maps and working out house rules for cover, and terrain effects. Lots of fun at the time, but I doubt I'll ever pull it out again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I would rate this higher as a classic and a forerunner of other war game greats. But due to its detail and complexity, it didn't see much play back in its day, and it's especially not likely to now with so many other possibilities even for the hard core wargamer. It does have some interesting battles - just doesn't attract someone to pull it out now a days.

This is what desert tank battles were all about.  The perfect solution for the gamer who wants to play tabletop miniatures without spending the money.  Of course the maps are drab, they're supposed to be--it's the desert, remember?  Be prepared for details, details, and more details, almost nothing is abstracted out of this game system.  Definitely too much for the twitch-n-bang video game generation to handle.

Before squad leader there was Tobruk.  Has many of the same elements.  I think the rules and set have stood the test of time.  It's board is nothing speacial(desert), but the rest is pretty good and the old Avalon Hill version on ebay can found for a fair price.

This was a revolutionary game when it came out. A lot of its mechanics were cumbersome, but ot was great to get the feel of tank v. tank combat in the desert. However, high ROF for some weapons meant rolling, rolling, rolling...

RATING: 6
I'd play only the smallest of firefights using the instructions as written, too much detail otherwise. My rule set mods improved play opting for streamlined generic charts and a handful of dice resolving multiple weapon salvos. The counters are small and slippery though the top down vehicle images are well drawn. The greyed-out border hexes mar the pristine desert game space.

Downright plain and ugly.  Combat system was a lot of work for just trading shots in the desert.  In some ways the combat system was ahead of its time, but it was wasted on the components and scenarios.  Consequently, I found it tedious and boring.

I have always liked this game. It has its clunkiness - armor combat requires at least 2 rolls per shot, multple shots per gun per turn, but I like the scale (counter = vehicle; squad; leader). If you like SL/ASL, this is clearly a precursor, and is worth getting to se the development.

RATING: 6
The desert is flat like a billiard table according to Tobruk. In comparison I would rate 88 higher as a panzer simulation. It is accurate, but also rather lifeless. The infantry system was pretty innovative and gave some indications to the differences between Italians, Germans and British armies of the desert. Overall, as a simulation it does a good job, as a game it is less noteworthy. Again, 88 is more interesting as a tank simulation, but you can typically get Tobruk on the cheap.

Sympathic game initiative. However it suffers from trying to be too euroish instead of coming up with clearer and cleverer game mechanics. Besides the playtime is somewhat short.

Unusual theme but with elements of Ticket to Ride works well, some degree of cooperation is needed to avoid being defeated by the game. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The basic game is rather boring, while extended is much better, but because of the orders that come each turn I feel like there is a lack of planning like in e.g. Ticket to Ride which gives you the same feeling. I like the special abilities on each card, because they allow you to do some combos, but the overall plan that I have in TTR is missing here. And Point-to-Point movement is not my favourite mechanism.

A good solid game. I like that you can plan a lot of things and you always know if you will be the first to deliver an order or not. There is never a turn when you have absolutely nothing to do. Advance rules only.

Yukihiro -> The game is about The Warsaw Uprising (august-october 1944), not about The Warsaw Ghetto Uprising (april-may 1943).
They were VERY DIFFERENT uprisings in fact.

And Your comment is the best proof, that this game is definitelly so much needed - just only beceause of those popular mistakes with the jewish and polish uprisings, both happened in Warsaw during WWII.

Scouts delivering orders in Poland in 1944, when the people of Warsaw rose against the Nazis occupying their city. Young boys worked as a couriers delivering letters and orders between squads of rebels, running through the underground sewage canals of Warsaw. Many of them died on that duty. Each player takes command of a unit of three Scouts with the goal of delivering the most orders on time. The scouts from different units are racing against each other to be first, but they also have to co-operate. If the order is not delivered on time crucial parts of the city, or even whole districts can be lost to the occupiers. If too many orders fall into hands of the enemy all players lose.

RATING: N/A
A light card-driven pick-up-and-deliver Euro with thematic wargamer appeal (and a nice historical booklet). Needs more play before an official rating, but my opponent and I both enjoyed a first 2-player try using the "expert" rules.

It seems that advice to skip the "basic" rules was warranted; the "expert" version ain't exactly complicated and is definitely more interesting. Save the less deterministic "basic" for playing with kids or for late-night filler.

"Little Insurgents" indeed.  My little insurgent 12 year old daughter beat me 52 to 19 in our first game... little rat swiped all my orders!

I'm so proud of her!  :D

We played the basic game, and I'm looking forward to trying the the expanded rules.

First copy was crunched by PODSpeople.  Most of the damage was absorbed by the box, but the board is a bit warped.  Still playable, but...  :(

Wow! The theme does not appeal to me but the gameplay is so nice and smooth. I will definitely buy it. EDIT: bought it :-)

There is one flaw though - the mechanism of switching the queue of orders may be used in a very hostile way (depending on the players). And that does not fit the game as a whole (in my opinion of course).

A gift from Filip with his signature (for my request). Thanks! It really feels good to see and have it published :-)

PL: Grałem w nią jedynie raz i był to prawdopodobnie mój ostatni. Gra, która kierowana jest do dzieci i młodzieży sprawila mi trudność w zrozumieniu zasad. Nie zaciekawił mnie również zam pomysł na grę. Przeszkadza także masa dziwnych, niezrozumiałych reguł oraz niejasna instrukcja rozgrywki.

EN: I played it only once and it was probably my last. The game, which is targeted at children and young people was difficult to understand even by adults. I also didn't like he whole idea of a game based on some historic events. There are some strange, incomprehensible rules and unclear gameplay instructions.

Preliminary rating as I've played once and only basic variant.

It's not very original game, but at times it's actually quite fun.  I like the fact that the game is tight - i.e. it's easy to lose to Germans (then all players lose) and you have to care about this, not only about your personal score.

One play only.

Attractively produced and fun pick up and deliver game requiring some planning, although opportunism cetainly has a role.

The Euro mechanisms and cartoonish graphics on the pieces seem to jar slightly with the theme of the 1944 Warsaw uprising, which (viewed through the pages of history) seems a particularly gruesome albeit heroic episode. That said, it's a proud moment for the Poles.

Would benefit from the pieces being less similar to each other - it can be hard to figure out which runner is working on which objective without studying the details on the pieces.

With the english rules from BGG this polish game becomes perfectly playable.  And what a great surprise it is!
Its a cooperative, screw-the-other-guy, pick up and deliver, hand management game with a great theme.

The components are fine, but aren't quite up to the best stuff being printed.  The polish names on the board and cards would be hard to read even if in english.  But don't let that stop you from trying this excellent game.

Too light for me, but it is a great family game. The theme of Warsaw Uprising is always an asset.

Although it is about extremely brutal historical event, the game does not include any sort of fighting and is very lighthearted resolving around mail delivery by brave young scouts. It is childish in a very good way, being colorful and still honoring the insurgents.

This is a brilliant game. A simple, yet subtle pick up an delivery game where the pressure is on for the young mail carriers to deliver their messages to the resistance before the Nazi's cut off their route. You need to act fast and get a move on or you will fail to deliver. Great components, The map is excellent. Lovely design all the way through. This game deserves wider distribution. English rules available on the Geek makes the game pretty much language independent.

Nice game with war theme, i enjoyed more the family version rather the gamer version, maybe because in the gamer version you can count all the things , and in the basic one there are Nazi who hunt your scout, really cool game version.

Only played the Basic game so far but very enjoyable. The game plays fast, all the mechanics hang together - especially the use of the movement cards to gain an advantage in turn order. I was surprised by how well the use of locations played out as well.
It's a curious trait of th egame that even though you're competing for orders you're still pleased when a fellow player delivers as it prevents the Germans gaining an advantage

In this charming Polish 'pick up and deliver'game, set in the Warsaw uprising, players are the 'little insurgents' of the title: boy/girl scouts delivering messages (orders) to help defeat the German invaders. Tho' players are racing to deliver their messages, they must also co-operate or else orders expire, regions will be closed down by the Germans and all the players lose.

Essentially a train delivery game, but rethemed to the Warsaw uprising (a bit of a taste by-pass). The game has some fun elements, including a re-implementation of the must play each of five movement cards from Niagara, which works rather better here.

RATING: 5
A race game that requires cooperation (at least part of the time) to avoid having all the players lose.  Players are scouts running orders for the Warsaw Ghetto uprisings between locations while trying to avoid having the German occupiers squash their efforts.  This is not a war game as the conflict is highly extracted with the game's focus on moving scouts from location to location.  Movement is based on cards that must be all played before a move can be repeated.  Quick playing and nicely produced.  Right after our first game, we dove in to try again.

The hidden gem of the con.  The base game is a lighter pick-up-and-deliver with some fun randomness in avoiding the Nazis (or gambling to be close to them to get an extra move).  The advanced game is cutthroat with plenty of intrigue in deciding what to go after and requires meticulous planning.  Both have a semicooperative feel as you need to deliver most of the messages or else everyone loses.

This is a conditional rating based upon a single play of the basic game that was definitely played incorrectly!  I have a fondness for "pick up and deliver" games (although having said that to a friend the other night, I couldn't think of a single game based around that mechanic that I've played, which means the perhaps I just enjoy the concept of "pick up and deliver" games [EDIT: A quick BGG search shows such personal favourites as Railroad Tycoon, Merchants & Marauders, Fire & Axe: A Viking Saga, Himalaya, Niagara, Timbuktu, Perry Rhodan: The Cosmic League, Return of the Heroes, etc.]), but there just wasn't enough to the basic game to keep me interested in this one.  Mali Powt... Pots... Post... Mali P. is based around an obscure yet fascinating historical setting, and based upon the BGG description, I feel like I might enjoy the game a lot more with the "extended variant" rules that incorporate special actions, more planning, secret goals, and a semi-cooperative element that sees districts fall into the hands of the Germans if missions aren't completed and the game lost by all if too many districts are taken over by the Germans.  And the Liberator expansion appears to add some more interesting elements too.  So if I ever get to play this obscure (in North America) title again, I expect my rating could rise by at least a couple of points.  But for now... Game design: 3/5  Personal enjoyment: 2/5  Total: 5/10

This was a LOT of fun and the game is not as light as I thought it would be from reading the rules. The German soldier is a very effective way of causing variability and adding a challenge to the game. Depending on how the orders come out, the game can be pretty easy or very difficult. In the first game, we were able to complete every order. In the second one, we were unable to complete 4 and both lost the game. I was 1 space short of completing the final order and winning the game. Very fun game and I cannot wait to try it with more players and try the extended version of the game.

RATING: 5.5
Although the theme and the artwork of this game are wonderful, I liked it less than I thought I would. The advanced version of the game is quite dry: Every turn you need to count steps to determine your (and other players') optimum moves. You can only do this after the previous player had his turn, because he might have ruined your plans by going for the same mission or, worse, reaching his destination before you do. It is still a gamble though, because your opponent might not go for the missions you think he will go for at all. Meanwhile, you need some luck with regard to the locations where new missions pop up, only being able to anticipate on this by spreading your little postmen across the board the best you can. I think a second play might be better (now I know how to make the best use of the board), but I am afraid that this is not my kind of game. Too much counting, considering the opposition and examining the board for the locations on the order cards really makes my head hurt.

I admit some of the appeal of the game is the difficulty in acquiring it. But I also really like the unique historical theme, and the artwork is quite nice too. The board is beautiful, and full of names we just butchered when pronouncing. We played the simpler "family" version at bgg.con, and it was still quite challenging, the little stormtrooper running around the board got in my way quite a bit. So, it's not just a kids game like I initially thought. Now I regret passing up the chance to buy it in Essen.

After 3 plays (both rules).

I think it's good for children, for adults basic version too simple. Far associations with Thurn und Taxis, Ticket to Ride with 'pick-up and deliver' mechanic.

I like, that game is semi-cooperative.

I didn't find pleasure in 2-players game.

I was one of playtesters of this game. First play reminded me of Thurn und Taxis. Very good family game. Comes with two sets of rules, with second one more suitable for gamers. There is some randomness with order cards popping up exactly where you're. Nevertheless I like it quite a lot.

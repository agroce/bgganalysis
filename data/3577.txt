Northern units are highly overrated in this game. You have to remember that the 11th Corps was shattered on the first day, and especially the pitiful performance of Sickles third corps and Hancock's second corps on the second day. Even Harry Pfanz's book "Gettysburg: The Second Day" gives the northern units very little credit. He describes Longstreet's attack and the subsequent Union army's performance as "very difficult to explain".  How could Caldwell's division of the 2nd Corps be routed so violently from TWO confederate brigades (Kershaw and Anderson)during its attack in the wheatfield?? Hancock himself said that Caldwell's units had acted "shamefully". How did several Northern brigades flee upon sight of Wofford's brigade advancing? The game is a drag until the unit qualities are accurately accounted for.

RATING: 10
SPI/TSR edition. Long game but very playable with 2-6 players. Most units come as reinforcements and this gives the game very good replayability value as the front is never the same. 
Leader's rules compell the players to keep together the units of the same formation and the rules for the guns ammunitions make them think twice before every fire, especially for the Conferedates who must break the U.S. line but are quite limited in ammo. 
My recommandation: first look at the film (Gettysburg) and then play the game.

Being the first game in Berg's regimental civil war series, I suppose it was inevitable that TSS would get some things wrong. Whatever. That can never change the fact that it got so very, very much right. This game is truly deserving of that often overused term "classic".

RATING: 9
Still one of my favorite games of all time.  This game still elicits vivid memories: from Heth's nasty tussle with the Union Cavalry, to the fight for the Wheatfield, to the bloody sunken road!  This game gives a vivid picture of the problems facing both armies at Gettysburg.  The small forces on hand at the onset of the battle makes for fast playing initially; but with a steady stream of reinforcements entering on both sides the battle ultimately evolves into a behemoth--where regiments can become badly intermixed, run out of ammo or suffer command or morale problems.  The sheer size of this battle forces players to think strategically as well as tactically.  And you'd better keep a loose eye on your supply wagons too; I've seen more than one attack fizzle for lack of ammo.

One of the original "monster" games, and along with its sister game "Wellington's Victory" has spawned the modern HPS computer wargames. Rules were convoluted and buggy, but the strategy and atmosphere were great. A solo or club game for most due to its sheer length, but well worth the time.

Damn, I loved this once upon a time, "panzer artillery" and all. And at this point I'd probably rather play this with a few rules tweaks than sit through 3DoG.

This game is large and lucious.  You start out with just a few units on the large (3 sheets) map but as reinforcements start pouring in you are soon fighting many battles at once.  It requires a hefty time investment but it is worth it.  Not really that complicated except for the scale.  The system which is fantastic can be played at a smaller scale in Stonewall by SPI and in a few other titles that escape me.

Always fascinating, sometimes thrilling.

Really stands up well in game history, the tactical situation is so interesting, with the constant flow of reinforcements on both sides. The Union player, enjoying interior lines, has more variation in play after the first day; the confederate needs a solid strategic plan.

The rules changes in the first errata make a better game. If you pick up an original flatpack edition, get the errata sheet from the Internet.

Later standard rules sets (GBACW 4.x) and a few optional rules give the player much leeway to determine how it paces and what decisions are important.

The game is very large, it is a full weekend endeavor for multiple players. My very favorite large game.

There has been a new update of TSS from TSR. Map graphics updated as well as counters which are now colour coded by corps/division. This is one of my all time favourites....but never did finish the full game; though completed solitaire until middle of 2nd day.

RATING: N/A
One of the most hyped-up game system on the tactical American Civil War.  Bullets are counted and number of dead bodies are figured out.  Detailed, but do not know whether it is playable as well.  SPI has been renowed for producing "accurate" realistic games....perhaps sometimes they have gone too far.  TSR has printed a second edition on this game with improved graphics and counters.  But the same game system remains intact.  I cannot imagine how I can manage a thousand coutners at the same time in 60 hours.  It must be a pain rather than a joy to do so.

This rating is mainly from nostalgia. Deserves a lower score. Played both versions of this one! (Plus Battlegroung Gettysburg by Talonsoft, which is TTS on the computer). Have to say, while the game is detailed and fun, the overall results are not acurate. Prefer the Gamers versions.

One of the few remaining SPI games in my collection.  The three-map setup takes up a little more space than I can currently handle, but I have set it up and played it twice in the distant past.  Considering this is a "monster" wargame, the rules are actually very easy.  One thing that was always difficult for me was quickly calculating the fire strengths of various units in formation, as firepower is determined by remaining unit size, weaponry, and range.  Artillery also varied greatly in this regard.

Hard to rank this game because it isn't really a game so much as a simulation.  Now a days, I'd never opt to play it.  Just too much of a commitment.  Back in '82, though, it was like a mountain that just needed to be climbed!  I can remember a memorable game that had gone on for 12 or so hours (over 2 days) that ended because a friend accidentally knocked a table and sent counters all over the maps.  In fact that was the last time that I played it.  For me, there are much better *games* that capture the essence of Gettysburg.  However, if I was deeply interested in the time period and the battle, this is the game to end all games.

Another one of those games I loved in my wasted youth when I could afford to spend 6 hours getting ready to play a game before actually playing it (See: The Longest Day)

If you like rolling to see if "Bob Jackson" stepped in a gopher hole, therefore reducing his movement by 1 yard per turn and possibly causing his weapon to misfire... this is the game for you.

RATING: 7
This and La Battaile de la Moscowa are the first two monster wargames I played and I think this one has aged better. There is something breathtakingly panoramic about watching Heth's Division trudge up the road to face Buford's cavalry at this scale. After the first day, I think the historical accuracy breaks down a bit because divisions that would historically be useless after so much fighting on day one are still combat effective on days two and three.

Regardless, from Redmond Simonsen's graphic artistry to Richard Berg's game design mastery, this game still deserves to be played and enjoyed.

With its long and dense SPI rulebook, this is a game I'm sure I'll never play but I've always wanted to own. It replicates the Battle of Gettysburg across three 22" by 34" maps and so many cardboard chits that it seems like there is one for every platoon, if not every soldier who fought in the battle. I was pleased to find this second-hand but in very good condition at UKGE 2017.

I knocked my rating down to a 6. I don't know...if I can bring a book and seriously read while my opponent does his or her move, then the game is going to lose its appeal. This game was eclipsed, I suppose, by those HPS games.

The rating system is tough for this one.  I knocked my rating down to 8, although the statement "Probably I'll suggest it and will never turn down a game" is false, because I no longer own the game.  Even if I did own it, I wouldn't suggest it at every turn, because it is so large.  Nevertheless, I think this is a wonderful game.  I've played this more than any other wargame.  I have no idea if it is an accurate simulation, and I don't care!  This game is amazing.  I really wish I had a copy, but it was destroyed.

With the included rules errata - specifically, the morale not pinned to the strength points - TSS first edition plays well. I played the Little Round Top scenario many times, and always had a great time. Played the second edition campaign twice - now three times! - and found it enjoyable each time as well. GREAT STUFF! Second edition smooths out the rules, bringing the GBACW games rules into the mix, and gets rid of the rules sleeze tactics that gamers used in TSS1. (building brestworks across roads to slow reinforcements, using fire by prolong to make your cannons more like tanks, etc.) TSS2 also uses the multi-level map, which helps you really visualize the actual battlefield. The maps and counters on the second edition are my only knock on this great game. They are very funtional, but the color sceme is ... garish compared to the first edition. Trust me, playing this game you'll get over it. STRONG suggestion - to have the historical result, you need to add in the optional fatigue rules, which nobody uses. It prevents both sides from running amok. (see my full review)

Monster Gettysburg game.  Getting a bit dated - 3 Days of Gettysburg (by GMT games and also a Richard Berg design) is a better updated version, with the now-ubiquitous Richard Berg chit-pull system and some other incremental improvements.  TSS has the usual histo-wargame problems of being too big, complex and time consuming for typical euro-gamers.  Best to play this one with teams of two or three.

TSR Second Edition. Sits on my shelf collecting dust. But I keep telling myself this is my "retirement" game that I'll set up on a table for months and learn to play when I don't have anything else going on. :)

The father of ACW tactical games. Three maps and over 2000 counters at the tactical level, but on a grand scale. Very miniatures feel to the rules; fire and melee combat, morale checks, leaders and their effects. For SPI in '76 these were state of the art components and maps and they've held up well. I played this one summer (two weeks), with four other gamers, and barely pulled off a win as the Union, a couple of years later four of us played it in a week and I was on the winning CSA side: some of the best fun I've ever had gaming. Later GBACW series games have helped clean up and streamline (sometimes) the rules, and later editions of TSS (or other game company variants) are mostly better for it. But I'll still play the original anytime.

We played this back in the monster game era of the 70's with 3 players per side.  It was fun to play but the artillery rules were somewhat unrealistic.  The Union players started advancing them like tanks unlimbering them in range of rifle fire.  Once unlimbered it was suicide to charge the guns so that was that.

Gettysburg at regimental level.  Scenarios are the best way to play as full battle takes a lot of time to play out at this level.

I've been playing the full campaign game (SPI version) at my local club recently and just had to pick this copy up (TSR 2nd Edition version) when I saw it on ebay from a seller not 20 mins down the road.
Overall I prefer the 'look & feel' of the SPI original version, the new look counters aren't too bad but I hate the map (colours too garish for my liking). Still a great game though and from what I can gather the 2nd Edition rules add a great deal to the subtleties of the game. Just need to find a copy of the rulebook (not supplied) and then I'll be able to judge for myself.

A large and teadious monster. The original edition wasn't very good looking either. But it was Gettyburg on a small scale. Today I would play miniatures before playing board games at this scale. But I had a lot of fun playing many games in the TSS/GBACW series. The second edition looks far better, much more colorful than the original. And arguably the second edition rules for TSS are the best rules used in the whole series.

Very well done monster title for the Battle of Gettysburg. Everything works very well and the fight for the valley can be decidedly exciting, anything from a whole new perspective to almost exactly reproducing the battle. Very well done. Takes hours and hours and hours and... you get the idea... to play.

This is by far and away the best of the Gettysburg games, IMHO.  It may be a monster, but it is very playable and has a few shorter scenarios, too.  Learning the Great Battles of the ACW rules might be nice if you want to play the other series games as well.  But I prefer the SPI version, the pink hills on the TSR ver. are ugly!

TSR edition. Ugly maps and counters. The system allows too much in terms of command and control. Otherwise a clean system. As in all Gettysburg games of this size you can spend an inordinate time firing artillery.

(First Edition): A bit dated now perhaps, but this game provided me with some of my most memorable face-to-face gaming experiences. A cleaner and less-cluttered system than more modern Gettysburg games, without being significantly weaker as a simulation. The CRT was way too bloody, but this was addressed by later games in the series.  

The TSR version holds no attraction at all.

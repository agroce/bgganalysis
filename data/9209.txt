Not very exciting, but strangely addictive trying to complete those routes.
Last game I played I was clearly leading and sabotaged myself comprehensively taking 2 more tickets.  Doh!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Scales well 2-5 players, beautifully produced, great introductory game. A bit of luck around the ticket draw but this is fine for this length and weight of game (light-middle). An essential purchase for anyone who plays with casual gamers or for serious gamers who occassionally like something lighter. The Europe map provides some variety and the ticket distribution is an improvement but the rest of the new rules detract from the game. The passenger rules in Marklin are excellent but make the game that little bit too long and the board is a bit too biased to completing tickets. I probably prefer the base game particularly now the 1910 cards have been released

Fun, lighthearted game for 4-5 players.  Good flow, decent strategy.  Hits a strange note between strategy and luck.  For the more part, strategy can win you the game.  That is, unless you get the short routes...  Or you are cut off...  
Anyway, that's why it's best for non-gamers and certainly worth a try for gamers too.

I know this is one of the most popular games that Board game geek can advertise for, but I don't enjoy it nearly as much as the other Euro games on my list. It seems like there is less interactions with people than other Euro games, which is what I find appealing about them.

I have played this one many more times than I've recorded.  I think it is a fine gateway game, but I do not find it particularly engaging nor strategic.  The value of laying down 5 or 6 link tracks is too high compared to ticket completion, which essentially breaks the game.

Took me forever to finally get a copy of this, and I am glad that I did. I saw the reviews and BGG rating but every time I was close to dropping the cash for it, I would look at the components, look at the theme, and go, "erm, no." Turns out it is a well made game with a tight system that is accessible to nearly everyone no matter what their level of game experience.

150909 As much as I respect the design, if I'm never playing it or pulling it out to be played....

130929  After TtR Marklin I really do respect the orignal a lot.  With the 1910 expansion its a great game it can be played tight and nasty (using the original deck after you've developed a knowledge of the ticket cards) or with all the cards in play you can just play fun and loose.  Just an absolutely great gateway and more game.

120910 After playing TtR europe, I've come away with a newfound respect for the elegance of this game.  I think it shines when played tight and nasty.  Which unfortunately is not the way my girlfriend prefers to play.

100102 may be a bit light for my taste, but one of the first one to bring out if its with non-gamers.

[I]tl;dr Ticket to Ride is a modern-day classic, deserves to be in most collections as a good intro set-collection game.[/I] 
[COLOR=#CCCCFF]____________________________[/COLOR]

Ticket to Ride is a classic along the level of Catan, and I definitely enjoy its simplicity and elegance. It's a very simple mechanic, but the player competition and the unknown aspect of the cards makes it different every time. 

Basically, players are competing to build train routes along different colored tracks throughout the United States. They accomplish this by drawing cards of the correct color, then claiming routes by placing their own trains along the route. 

You earn points by completing Tickets (preset routes that you draw from the ticket deck), placing routes, and winning the longest connected route, which is similar to the Longest Road in Settlers of Catan. 

Overall, I enjoy Ticket to Ride, but I don't feel the need to have it in my collection. It's definitely worth some plays even if you're a hardcore gamer, and the rules can be gone over in about fifteen minutes. This makes Ticket to Ride a great choice for new or reluctant gamers, since it's really easy to have a fun time with it. Personally, I prefer introducing people with [thing=123540][/thing] instead.

Has risen from a 6 to a 7 after several plays  For such a simple game, and one that contains a lot of luck there is quite a bit of turn angst (especially in the endgame), a quality I definitely like in a game.

I really enjoy this game! it's a pretty light weight game which really fits the bill some times, everyone who plays it really seems to enjoy it. It's a rummy-type game where you collect cards of the same colors and then claiming routes. The small cards while annoying at first really don't seem to bother me once the game gets going but I still wish they could've just included full sized cards instead of charging you $20 for the 1910 expansion which is basically just full sized cards... None the less, I still really enjoy this game.

Light and enjoyable. I'm always up for a game. I really don't like the Mystery Train expansion though. UPDATE: given to my cousin Mitch's family. I consider it a bit of gaming evangelism.

I also own the following unofficial maps:

UK w/ Cynical Expansion: absolutely brillaint! I love messing with the other players... if you don't want any "take that" in your TtR game, then stay away from this one.

A good light game with little downtime and relatively quick play. After playing with two different sets of friends in 4-player games, I can see the criticism of this game being multiplayer solitaire. The games were pretty quiet as everyone went about playing their routes. Still, a good game that I enjoy playing.

Update (11/2010): After many more plays, the multiplayer solitaire element diminishes once people know the game better. More interaction/blocking. Enjoying playing this with my wife and our 2 1/2 year old daughter likes to do "jobs" like picking cards, laying trains, etc.

This is a good, simple family game. In fact, if your family is like mine, they may not want to play anything else... which is actually not always a good thing. In light of this, one of the other versions may have been a better bet - they seem equally fun but slightly more interesting.

A true joy of a game to play. One which owing to the cartoonish box art, I walked by many a time but glad my gut feeling kept drawing me back for another look.

Extremely simple to learn and teach, with multiple strategies for victory. Play ethically or ruthlessly, this game is packed to the rafters with that "just on more try" feeling and a very peaceful flow.

Well expanded by the "1910" game pack, once players become attuned to each other's devious minds, city objectives and ways to play are manifestly mulitplied.

Hard to play solitaire (a web/PC version caters for this), this is a gem for 2-3 people, though the game does cater for a competitive 5. Extremely well suited for husbands and wives, guys and gals. Bound to create some fun-borne controversy for discussion (or moody glances) whilst watching TV after.

This is a great family game, and a great "Gateway" game.  It has a history of making gamers out of otherwise non-gamers.  There are many different versions of it but I find the USA map to have plenty of replayability. ;)  I highly recommend the 1910 expansion for this game because the cards that come with the base game are way too small.

Ticket to Ride is a simple and elegant game. Played with many new people to the hobby.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
One of those games that just screams "instant classic". I remember seeing it on the table of the game shop I would frequent when I lived in Seattle, being played consistently. Anybody can sink their teeth into this one and enjoy themselves.

While I find Ticket to Ride to maybe be a little too simple in execution, it gets serious points for being intuitive and easy to teach. There's really no reason not to own this game, since it's a bulls-eye for introducing new people to the hobby. The component quality is rock-solid and the pace of the game is a quick clip, giving just the right amount of time to plan out your next move before it's your turn again. 

And, considering how straightforward the game is, it has a decent amount of freedom in strategy. Depending on how things are playing out, it may be best to just try for all of the six train routes, or maybe you're feeling cutthroat and just want to prevent other players from completing their routes. I've even seen a player do a mad grab for more route tickets at the end of the game, in order to hopefully have fulfilled them already. Which worked!

Ticket to Ride may seem like a bit of a relic at this point, but it's status as a go-to gateway game or simple competition isn't a question in my mind.

Easy to teach, fun to play. This is the best game for all audiences. The reason I don't own this anymore is, that I substituted the base game for Märklin Edition.

To be honest, I'll turn down a game on certain occasions. TtR has grown slightly old.
8->7 

2014/10
Original = Best for families with 4-5 players, elegant rules, suffers from card hoarding strategy

Märklin = Most satisfactory for gamers, strong incentive to make early plays mitigating the hoarding problem, a bit fiddly

Nordic = Best for families with 2-3 players, slight hoarding problems which are mitigated by the tight map, random take that aspects due to the tunnel mechanics

Europe = worst of the bunch in all aspects

What a good game!  It works well with any number of players from 2-5, but plays very differently with each.  I use different tactics accordingly.  It's light, colourful, well made, simple to play, but with plenty to make you think.  It's not as deep as some German-style games, but it's elegant and fun and much better than Santa Fe and several other rail games.  Tactically, it's hard to tie down.  I've won by going for a few long tickets, lots of shorter tickets, playing for long (5 and 6) routes, dominating the middle of the board, dominating a side, going North to South, East to West.  And of course, most often I lose, anyway!  It's this hard to tie down quality added to the fun factor that makes me return to it so often.  I'll play this anytime.

This game is a fun route-building game where it really pays to pay attention to what other players are doing (and always have back-up plan!)

Plus, my kids love it, probably because it's not too directly confrontational with four. Always played with the 1910 expansion (for the bigger cards, sometimes for the ticket variants).

Another one of the modern classics. A cornerstone of my family's collection. 

Anyone from an 8 year old kid to your 80 year old grandmother can learn this game in 10 minutes, and the theme, construction, bits, mechanics, and replayability rock. 

Recommended for parents who want to get their kids into the tabletop hobby, and for anyone who wants a simple, enjoyable, and dependable workhorse to introduce to new gamers. It can be arbitrary/random, and it isn't without flaws, but it's worth the price of admission.

RATING: 5.5
A good gateway game, I prefer the Europe map to add a bit more complexity and to ease the pressure with station tokens for blocked routes, otherwise it can be too easy to be completely blocked. Not a game I tend to seek out but with new/non-gamers it's a nice introductory game.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Ok, so it's not the DEEPEST game.  A lot depends on luck - which destination cards you draw and which your opponent(s) draw.  Two player games are over faster than my wife would like, but she's always ready to go again.  The more you play, though, the more strategies open up.  Blocking becomes enjoyable to try and accomplish, though it's not very apparent WHO you should block.  It also becomes important to watch how many trains your opponent(s) have left - in that it reminds me of Lost Cities (among others) where you have to be aware of when the game will end.

Most of all, though, this game is FUN.  And I've enjoyed every time I've played it - and how often can you say that?

RATING: 2
Played this three player and I thought the winner had skunked both of us. But then I did the math. At one point in the game the winner played on the last two spaces going into Los Angeles one turn before I was going to play on them. This allowed him to complete a route and screwed me out of completing a route. This resulted in a 90+ point swing of the final score. Had I played on those two points first the winner would have tied me for second place. Any game that allows such a huge swing in scoring by such a minor play is broken in my opinion.

It's a fantastic game....an excellant gateway game.  I find it more of a set collection game than a train game.
This has been replaced with Marklin as the favorite game in the house.  But the orginal is still great.

I am glad I picked this up.  

I think my daughters were 8 and 6 when they first started playing this game.  But my eldest liked it right from the start.  The younger one took some time before she started playing. 

We played this a couple of times with 2 and it works quite well (although not much interaction).  It's shorter with 2.

A gateway game, but it's one I introduced to my wife and we play over and over.  Easy to learn and easy to play and the games are less than half an hour. Another interesting fact is that the optimal strategy in a 2-player game is not the optimal strategy in a 4-player game.  Eventually, you can figure out the optimal strategy and then to some extent, it becomes a luck-of-the-draw game.  It took a LOT of plays for us to figure it out, but because of that, I downgraded it, because the replay factor is evaporating.

I played this game just once, so these are mostly impressions that may change after multiple plays.

There're games with simple rules that are lots of fun. This game is not one of them. Ticket to Ride is not a bad game by any means but it is a very mediocre and disappointing one. I saw countless reviews and game-plays before buying it... and the game never sounded fun to me, but I ended up picking up a copy anyway. I needed a good gateway game to introduce people to the hobby during my Erasmus scholarship and on-line tons of people kept going over and over about Ticket to Ride being the best of them. So I decided to try it.

I understand that this is my opinion and experience, but Ticket to Ride really didn't work for me. I sincerely don't understand what is the fun of collecting cards turn after turn after turn, until you can finally play something. There's some tactics involved for sure, but the mechanics are really not exciting. It's the just same thing over and over again! Furthermore every time I played it, Ticket to Ride felt too long for what it is. I ended up wishing for the game to end and ironically so did the other people at the table: those that I wanted to introduce to board-gaming. I understand that TtR is a simple family game and it was wrong from me to expect more... maybe the hype ruined this for me, but I can also name a bunch of other family games that are way more fun and way better as gateway game. Terribly mediocre game.

The United Kingdom/Pennsylvania expansion brought some new life into this game and it actually made me enjoy it more. Yet I still think that Ticket to Ride is an average game that doesn't work for me.

Rating without expansion: 5.

FAVOURITE GAME - Ticket to Ride is a cross-country train adventure game. Players collect train cards that enable them to claim railway routes connecting cities throughout North America. The longer the routes, the more points they earn. Additional points come to those who can fulfill their Destination Tickets by connecting two distant cities, and to the player who builds the longest continuous railway. It is one of the best family games I have tried until now. With the simple rules and relatively fast playing time it catches on very quickly.

Just doesn't grab me.  I can see its gateway potential, but the rules seem to me to cry out for the thing to be played with spoiler-style nastiness.  For some reason, we just don't do it that way, and as a result it's pretty blah.

Update: I think the problem is that the disincentive for spoiling play is so great - you miss a turn.  But what if there was a rule allowing you to lay down n-1 cards instead of the required n as long as the rails you were claiming shared an endpoint town with the last player's move?

Ticket to Ride isn't my first choice. Ever.

However, it has endured in my collection as a favourite of family members and has endeared itself to me over the years I've owned it. 

Strategy gamers can struggle to understand casual/family gamers and how accessability is a really big deal for them. Ticket to Ride is completely accessible and provides that sense of building something, together, while also taking the edge off confrontation (which is present, but subtle). 

Although I don't love it, I tried my hand at 'train', pickup-and-deliver, and other route-building games and I'd still rather play this. I'm terrible at it, but I always seem to have some fun playing :).

:cry: :) :D :D :yuk: A game that took me four years to bother playing. It's OK, but just OK. The whole endless drawing of colored cards is kind of tedious and then WHAM! everyone starts building everywhere. Then the person who completed longest route and a coast to coast ticket wins (usually). Both of my games went very fast... by the time I completed my original tickets, you barely had time to finish anything else you drew. 

Perhaps an expansion plays differently? Perhaps not.

A railway game which players have to build railway tracks based on the colours of the railways cards players possess.  Mission cards are present in the game which helps players to gain more points if they manage to link up a chain of cities.  At the start of the game, players are given the chance to change mission cards but once the game is played, the mission cards could not be exchanged anymore.  Deduction of points at the end of the game if objectives of mission cards could not be accomplished.

Good points: Easy to play.  Mission cards are present so that players will choose their cards wisely before the game even starts.

Bad points: This game resides too much on luck.  There is no actions which players can decide on the railway cards to be chosen.  Missions cards are also given by random.  Though it can be exchanged, players can

This game is similar to Thurn and Taxis with connecting railway routes instead of postal routes.  With less decision making components in Ticket to Ride, I would think that Ticket to Ride is less appealing to me.  During the game, I felt that that is hardly anything I can do to affect the game.  Of course, I can connect a railway to disrupt the mission of another player but that is only when I can get the necessary cards in hand and I have guessed the mission correctly.

So, I recently played the original TtR (with Mystery Train edition). We ended up playing a variant that I made up - I separated the 17-22 pt long routes and distributed them as one of the route cards at the beginning of the game. All discards are still returned to the bottom of the deck, so if someone ends up picking a long route later (even with the Engineer card), that's fine. I only wanted to even out the beginning routes so that everyone has an opportunity to keep a long route ticket. 

With 5 players, TtR becomes too chaotic and less strategic - it's more of a frantic scramble to complete the first route. Perhaps TtR makes a better 4 player game. Played Ticket to Ride several times before I started tracking my games played (approx. 2-5 times). Tracked on family game list (grooven).

Great family style game with enough strategy to keep it interesting for the gamer but simple and casual enough to rope just about anyone into a game. And of course, the usual great production job from Days of Wonder doesn't hurt either. The standard set of tickets in the base game has long overstayed its welcome. I now play with any of the 1910 expansion tickets only. That drops the base game a bit for me.

It's Ticket To Ride.  It's lasted this long for one reason.  It's very good.  It is fun to play with plastic trains, and it is fun to collect sets of colors.  It is only as cut-throat as you want it to be, and it's one of the few games that I can play with a 6 year old and still have a good time (Though I prefer to play with adults).

This is a very good game. I can play this with nearly anyone. I've played with my girlfriend, my parents, my grandparents, friends who don't play board games, and friends who do play board games. The game-play is simple but there is enough strategy to keep experienced gamers occupied. With two players I can knock out a game in 30 minutes, with a compliment of 5 new players it still plays in just over an hour. I think this should be a staple in every home.

It's a good game, just not one that I would pick over others if not playing with non-gamers.

It is so hard to describe my relationship with Ticket to Ride. I got it for Christmas from my girlfriend because I really wanted it. At this point I had begun to play games such as Puerto Rico and El Grande. I had also been branching out to try other games as well. The first time I played Ticket to Ride it didn't seem to have the spark or staying power that El Grande (my current favorite) had. My family enjoyed it and that was great so it got played at home, but when I brought it to school there was a lukewarm reaction to it.

It sat shelved for months until the summer when I tried to get together a weekly gaming group. Ticket to Ride was my game of choice for indoctrinating new gamers because it supported a larger group of players better than Carcassonne. At first I did not see how there was a lot of strategy in the game. All of the meaningful decisions seemed to be made when you picked your tickets (before you even start the game); however, the more I played the more I realized that board position was important. Long routes are better than short routes, regardless of what type of ticket to you have. You have to balance your important priorities now vs. your long term goals.

I came back to school with a renewed sense of how to play and love this game and I was lucky enough to find a lot of people who share my love for it. It is one of the games that gets pulled out the most often now which is great, because it is truly a great game.

2-5(4)

It's a great, great, great gateway. Probably the best I've encountered. (A good metric is what my "I've got two kids, I'm playing a game, I don't want to work" sister thinks of it, and she would play this one again). It's incidentally, and non-confrontationally, interactive (until you get more advanced, in which case you start to tactically block).

There are some "more dominant" strategies: I can see accumulating lots of cards, getting long routes and then, after your network is established, cycling tickets being really hard to beat. But it's Ticket to Ride! If you're playing that way against people you're trying to introduce to gaming, you're not doing "gateway" very well. Not saying that you should try to lose, but don't break the game.

People (correctly) say that it's basically set collection. Sure, but it's easy to get, attractive, and all of it feels thematic enough (and not tacked on) to really engage players. Not something I'll always play, but a go-to gateway, easily.

Returning to Ticket to Ride after a long break, I found a game I'd thought rather average that was actually pretty enjoyable.  It remains a simple game and yet the choke points on the board and the pressure to complete that ticket before somebody blocks you (or the game ends) creates a good tension.  I still find the luck of the ticket draw somewhat problematic and in future will propose separating the long and short tickets as the Europe version first did.

The Days of Wonder production can't be faulted and the card art is particularly evocative.

Ticket to Ride (w/ USA 1910 expansion) is fairly light, medium length, and easy to learn.  Overall, I think the game could be a touch shorter, to balance the degree of luck with drawing tickets.  I don't really mind the tickets and their push-your-luck effect since I like a degree of managing probabilities in a game, and I do enjoy games with spatial contention.

I liked the USA 1910 expansion, and was told that it helps fix some design problems TtR (Ticket to Ride).

OVERALL: I've enjoyed playing TtR and will play again, though preferably w/ the USA 1910 expansion.

RECOMMENDATIONS: TtR fans interested in a shorter game with a bit more push-your-luck should certainly check out Ra (http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/12).  For fans of the spatial aspects of TtR, Through the Desert (http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/503) is an absolute gem of a game.

It's hard to imagine a better gateway game for people who grew up with Monopoly or Risk.  Beautiful board that's a mini geography lesson as well.  Lots of non-gamers ask to play this again.

I wish there was a Rock Ridge card that would block western expansion.  "Somebody go back and get a sh#t-load of dimes!"

Also, why isn't there a TTR: Isle of Sodor yet?  Seems like a no-brainer, and my boy would be all over it.

:arrowE: [u]Synopsis[/u]:
Rummy played with a board and fancy trains. Draw train cards and play them in sets to construct routes between cities. Use destination cards to allow for scoring completed routes across the continent. Draw two cards of your choice, or draw from the pile blind, or take a single wild train. Once a player gets down to two or fewer available trains, the last round is triggered. It's basic, but compelling.

:arrowE: [u]What I like most[/u]:
The base game is bland, even for a gateway game. TTR: Europe adds just enough complexity to make the system more interesting, but it's really TTR: Team Asia that provides the evergreen rating I ascribe to Ticket to Ride. Team Asia adds a sort of blind, mostly-cooperative aspect to scoring for a pair of players, wherein a single tray of train cards are shared between both and can be used by either player, but the individual hands of train cards and destination cards are still hidden from each other. This creates a great sense of industrialist cooperation in a time period where neither company has complete access to each other's planning. I love it. It's fun. It's hilarious. It makes for a lot of "YES! I hoped you would do that!" and "GAH, I needed those! No!" moments. If you can read the actions of your teammate, you can do very, very well.

:arrowE: [u]What I like least[/u]:
Overall, I find Ticket to Ride can be boring for some new players who might do better with "deeper" entry points, and  I need to get a good gauge on what I should expect from beginners. Should we start with the base or Europe? Should we add Asia? Should we just play a different game? I see TTR as a tool more than a game I want to go out of my way to play.

Sold the Marklin version - now I can see what the fuss is all about (less really is more).  Plays well - great gateway game.  Even better with the 1910 expansion!
[4]2-5
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
The new standard for entry games. The 1910 expansion is essential die to the small train cards and destination tickets found in the base game. 

Complexity - simple, you draw cards, place trains from cards in hand, or draw new tickets

Strategy - moderate, you have to be flexible. Being bold and managing your trains will net you a high score but you have to be timely and efficient or the game will end too soon for you. 

Luck - moderate, you have no say in what cards are available, what routes and train cards you draw randomly, only how to place them. Even the most flexible strategies can get beat by a good draw. 

Interaction - very high. Almost everything you do effects other players. There is a chance nobody will want to go to the areas you do or get the colored trains you have but that is not the case most of the time. 

Fun - with the luck factor moderate many skill levels can compete and first time players can even win. You can enjoy this game with friends but not if you are hoping a grand matter plan will win you the game for certain.

It's a fun game involving trains and connecting routes. I like the card drawing mechanic it shares with a lot of other games. The only bad thing about this game is that so much depends on which route cards you draw at the start. Someone with a good set will easily win unless they don't know what they are doing.

2/17/2011 - Four player ticket to ride action. Not my favorite game but a favorite with my family. My wife took an early lead but made a key mistake not connecting her long trains together, which cost her the win by 3 points. The winner lucked out when he pulled 2 destination tickets in the last 3rd of the game, that he had already finished.

I even give it high marks because they made sure that the game can be enjoyed even by color blind people (which i am one.)  Love it love it love it

I don't understand why this game is rated so highly. It flopped with my group. It is far too simplistic. All you do is draw cards till you can build a railroad that someone may have already taken. Then you do the same process again. And again. And again. The only interesting feature is the goals, like getting from New York to LA. 
Overall, TTR is a mediocre game at best.

This is a good little gateway game, but I don't understand why it has sold so much, or won its awards.  I guess because it's so accessible.

My problems with this game are less so having played it more, but it takes too many plays to see why this is so fun.  Its solution to runaway leader is to just keep the leader secret.  Initial route draws also seem unfair sometimes.

Simple and bold.  Ticket to ride is like Rummy with trains.  While the gameplay hardly paves any roads unpaved, it just does everything so well, and you can't help but love it.  Even though the Rummy style gameplay, with matching train colors is not representative at all to the theme.  The overall thought process, when playing, is.  Players take on tickets to link far away cities for big points, and other players battle to be the first to lay track on certain routes.  The coordination of all this equals a brilliant game, the whole family can play.

Why does "Settlers" always seem to be everyone's gateway game?  This one's a much better gateway, in my opinion.  A ridiculously simple rules set, with just enough choices and risk-taking opportunities to make it mind-bending.  The more players you get, the better, as the screwage factor increases as the game gets more crowded. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
Not much interaction or fun, and highly derivative of other games. It seemed to drag with five players, and no one tried blocking anyone else; it just seems to be a case of "collect cards and play them."  (Same thing in my second play, with four players -- no one really focuses on anything except their own goals.  If any blocking occurred it was unwitting.) A step above Transamerica, but that's not saying much. Don't understand why people play it, much less rate it highly. Only strategy is to try to make long chains; shorter ones are almost worthless. I'm sure this game made Mr. Moon a millionaire, but I just don't see it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I just don't get this game. I mean I get it. I just don't get what all the fuss is about. You draw color cards so you can later play them to play train tokens on matching color tracks to make routes that hopefully you can match to the tickets you drew earlier else you will lose a ton of points. It's not that the game is bad, I just don't get why it's such a stand out to so many people. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A real fun game, Ticket to Ride is simple to play and games are pretty quick. The route system (and rather, how it's randomly handed out at the start of the game) can put players at a disadvantage, but the real point winners in this game are the six-length train routes. Games between experienced players can be pretty fun, because you start to get a good feel for what routes the other guy has, so it's easier to be a bit more cutthroat.The 'resource' system of drawing cards is very well done; Even if you draw resources you can't use, the ability to 'cash' them in for five and 6 length train routes (and big points) makes sure that the player isn't frustrated by his bad 'luck.' In fact, building a giant hand of cards is a pretty good strategy, allowing you to pick and choose the routes you take.The game is extremely easy to teach to new players, and while a great game with only two players, is still a lot of fun with 3 to 5. A game you can't go wrong with!

Maybe it's the map I'm playing? or maybe it's how I'm playing it? 

But Ticket to Ride just feels sort of boring and really really long. It feels like I'm sitting there for 45 minutes in silence with 3 others, staring at the map and my cards and mulling over the same two choices. 

A plus, I suppose, is that it's easy to teach and learn.

It's better than some of the terrible classic board games, but this gateway game was still too close to them for me to enjoy.

You look at the board and identify some cities to connect.  Even this is going to be heavily influenced by the city connection bonus cards you are randomly dealt.  And then you draw cards that have the color you need.  And you draw and draw and draw.  

Decision making time is over.  Now you sit and take turns drawing cards to see who's plan is going to work out best.

It's not quite that terrible.  You can sometimes spot an opening and slightly modify your plan or take advantage of an opening to block an opponent, but it really isn't that interesting.

Ultimately, the meaningful decision making offered by the game doesn't come close to the amount of time you spend trying to collect matching sets of colored cards in your hand.  It's just a fancy Rummy variant.

If it is up to Canasta-like weird collecting Cards until your hands and wrists hurt i really prefer "Bau auf" -  Maybe one of the reasons ist the somehow funny "plaste and elaste" type of material, reminding me of the years of the german democratic republic - i just do fancy satirical backgrounds. The other reason is - you dont collect cards here, but craftsmens services in form of little plastic loos and such on a piece of cardboard (VEB)

This game is a hit with virtually everyone I've introduced to it, even observers.  People can get locked into Settlers if you show them that first, and Ingenious works too but doesn't seem to really get people going on other stuff.  I've found that people will actually play other games after TTR, though.  Playing online will make you realize how often you're drawing, but also illustrates how much skill can be a factor; if you play top players in 2P games, you will get smoked.  TTR:Europe appears to be more popular as a "gamer's game," but I think that's a ruse as it effectively eliminates blocking as a major tactic.

Very cool.  I enjoy it every time I play.  As I get to know it better, there's less downtime between turns than there was initially.  It's a nice, simple, fun game, one that I can definitely see a wide range of people enjoying.

NOTE: The USA 1910 expansion is essential.  After playing with that a few times, then going back to the tiny cards of the original, I am fully convinced of this.

One of the easiest to teach games available.  Game play is straight forward.  There is a significant luck element in the ticket draws, but the train car draws are more strategic since the players can select the color of their choice from the ones displayed.  Watching other players picks will also give an edge in predicting where they may play.  Highly playable, quick, and enjoyable.  Not a gamers' game, but a solid light fun game nonetheless.

I picked this up at the Armageddon expo for about half the normal price after wanting to get it for at least a couple of months.
The day I bought my copy I went to a friends place and played seven 2-player games in a period of about 4 hours. Even if I had never played it again it proved itself to be a worthwhile purchase on that day.
Over the first two weeks I averaged more than 1 game a day. Certainly a worthwhile purchase.

Super simple to start playing, which is a huge plus.  It's also easy to track how you are doing, and has a decent level of strategy for such a light and quick playing game.

It's just a little bit too simple, and has too little player interaction to keep my attention.

Rules are so simple, it's easy to explain and play, but involves a lot of thinking.

seems like best strategy is to horde cards and then make your move all at once.

the strategy of trying to block people doesn't really work.  You just waste your pieces and they most likely just path right around you with no issues.

fun with more than 2 people.  very "take that!" when playing one on one.

I'm usually up for a game, but not really that excited about more than one game.

Addictive, fun to play, challenging. A simple but good product, excellent introductor game for non-geeks. Nice online version. The game is less interesting with 3-5 players than with 2-4 in my opinion. Moreover, luck in having good objectives cards plays sometimes a noisy role.

It's been said before, it's really just a set collecting card game with a map. Nonetheless most gamers in my group like it (I don't as much). On first game with my 60+ mother and my 5 y.o. son, everyone had a wonderful time: wide appeal. My son won and I was surprised how quickly he caught on to the rules: very accessible game. Sessions since have been satisfying for the group and I recommend this great family game. Played competitively, players get worked into a frenzy trying to maximize points. I would say the interaction is incidental.

While enjoyable, I think it ranks slightly below TtR:E in my book. The reason for this is the tickets. I gave back one of my starting tickets, drew tickets once and kept two of them. Three out of the four tickets I kept were coast-to-coast which, even with the medium ticket I didn't complete, gave me the win. I much prefer having the separate stacks of long tickets and other tickets in TtR:E.

First Game: 13 Oct. 2007
Played this with 6 player using my 6-player variant and it worked wonderfully.  I just grabbed another set of trains from TtR: Marklin and we were set to go.  However, we were running out of tickets fast and I need to get 1910 to supplement this.

I prefer this so much more to TtR:Marklin.  It has far less rules overhead for the same approximate amount of depth.  Also It was much easier to handle 6 players.  The things that I do miss from TtR: Marklin is the bonus points for completing the most amount of tickets and splitting the tickets into two decks of short and long tickets.  Next time I'll just split them up, Marklin style.

The third game in the gateway "Holy Trimurti" (Settlers of Catan and Carcassonne being the other two), it's simple and funny and well worth a play or three when you have some non-gamer friend and you want to give him his first dose of eurogaming drugs...
Ticket to Ride can be just a very simple set collection game, but the competition on the map contributes to a tense gameplay: mr. Moon delivered a home run (as far as you want a gateway game) and did deserve his Spiel des Jahres!

Update august 30th, 2012: after I bought the iOS version of TTR Europe, physical versions of the game had seen play again, and I must admit the light fare is quite enjoyable... vote raised to 6.5!

Update january 1st, 2015: the game sees the table quite often, thanks to the in-laws and the iOS version. Vote raised to 7.

Guess with some much more games, Ticket to Ride just seemed to simplified for me. Used to enjoyed it more but didn't seemed to enjoy it as much as before.

Still, this is a great game to get people more interested in board gaming. Player with 2 new female players to our group and they enjoyed it. 

Have to use more of the 1910 components in the next game.

Not only the best "gateway" game ever created, the TTR series might have the best rules of any game in recent history. The games are simple, play quickly, have great components, and offer a ton of fun choices. The American version is the most simple version of the game, but is also more competitive because it is easier to block other players. It is a better 2 player game than the European version.

RATING: 5
This game bores me pretty quickly. There isn't much to it, throwing down trains to make the longest continuous train, or getting your three plus cards completed. It's just waiting to see where the other players are going and trying to work around them or not. It helps to know some geography but isn't necessary.

To me this is probably the best board game. Everyone i introduced it to loved it: gamers, non-gamers, old , young, man, woman. If you play a lot you should pimp it with the 1910 extension, it'll solve the little imbalance in the destination tickets and give you a set of bigger, nicer cards.

Personally, I rate the game very low since it is so simple and gets very boring. However, it is certainly one of the (if not THE) single greatest "first" gateway game produced so far. Therefore my rating is a mix between how I feel about it personally and the ten that it gets for hooking so many people. As my personal favorite gateway game choice, Ticket to Ride is currently in my Top Ten best games of all time.

Hacienda has taken the place of Ticket to Ride for this sort of  entry-level game... and I rarely play Hacienda.  I do remember TTR being kind of fun for there was a balance between drawing cards or claiming routes.  New players have fun pointing out the geographic inaccuracies found on the map.  According to Alan Moon, I live in Duluth.

Now that I own and have played Ticket to Ride I am amazed by comparisons I have read regarding this and TransAmerica.  Aside from both being about trains and situated in North America, they are nothing alike.

In Ticket to Ride hand management plays a key role in winning or losing.  I enjoy how different strategies regarding route cards come into play after mulitple playings.  For anyone who enjoys rummy and it's variants, this game is for you.  I also feel that the game scales very well from two to five players.  

I believe, and it's been proven, that this is an excellent gateway game for non-gamers.   I wouldn't mind a variant with trading of route cards or train cards, but then again, I could do it on my own.

The artwork and quality of the trains, cars and board should be applauded. There is a good pace to this game that I like: it seldom drags along (unless some people unnecessarily over-analyse), is great for newbies to pick up and has enough variety from game to game to prevent over-familiarity, monotony, predictability and boredom. There is enough luck-element in the game which prevents it from being totally strategy-based. For some of us, a bit of luck is a good, though sometimes frustrating thing!

[i]Posted: 9/20/05, Rated: 10[/i]

I love this game!  Its theme is wonderfully romantic, its concepts are easy to learn, and it looks great while playing.  It can be confrontational or not, depending on your preference.  My seven year-old son won convincingly in his second game.

But perhaps the most telling is this comment from my wife "I would definitely play that game again!"  Any title that has that effect on her should be rated an eleven.

[i]Updated: 12/24/09, Rated: 9[/i]

[i]Ticket to Ride[/i] is still a fantastic gateway game.  However, it has reached a point where it feels "solved:" strategically place a couple of key routes (I'll leave the discovery of them up to the reader), and then raid the "tickets" deck.  It also ends up being a game where you draw, and draw, and draw, and draw, and draw, and draw, and draw, and draw, and draw, and draw, and draw, trying to push your luck one more turn before finally buying a segment.  My wife and her friends still like to play, so this will remain a "9" due to its mass appeal.

You know, I (stupidly) bought into DoW milking of their cash cow with Europe, Marklin, and Switzerland.  I ended up trading (or even giving) away every version except the original, the only one that I ever want to play.

I mean, why the hell can't DoW just release another freggin' map rather than "new" games w/ one rule changed in a "real game" box?  I'm ashamed I bought Europe and Marklin, but the madness ends there.  I will _not_ buy any more TtR games, not TtR:Nordic, not TtR:TCG, not TtR:Anything.

I would, however, buy a new map for the base game.

Very fun game on the lighter side. The wife and I play often, as well as with other people while visiting. Very easy to get into and easy to play. 

The train cards could have been a little bigger to make for easier shuffling. Other than that, the components are good.

I do notice that the players picking W-E routes seem to win more often than people picking N-S routes although that's just me and we play it more to have fun than for any serious level of competitiveness.

RATING: 4
This game is mildly entertaining when the group plays quickly, and mind-numbingly boring when the group plays slowly. If my entire turn is to draw two cards, and then I have to wait five minutes until my next turn, I'd simply rather not play the game. But if people play quickly enough to keep me engaged, I'm willing to play a game now and then. Additionally, I think Carcassonne, Settlers of Catan, Fjords, Through the Desert, and a host of other games are more interesting 'gateway games' than Ticket to Ride, further reducing its appeal to me. On iOS, the game is more enjoyable (less upkeep, faster pace), but still doesn't offer much in the way of interesting decisions or a particularly enjoyable experience -- perhaps a 5 or 6 rather than a 4.

Who doesn't know about this game at this point? The best "gateway" games are those that you can use to introduce others to the hobby while still being a game seasoned gamers want to play. That's where this game falls for me. Do you play nice or try to cut off everyone's routes? Do you go for more tickets and hope for synergy or risk getting burned? Do you take that faceup locomotive or take two off the top? It's not a game I want to play all the time but I really enjoy it when I do.

The more I play it, the more I like it.  My first impression was that it was too simple, but I have begun to appreciate the pure fun of the game.  There is no deep strategy here and there is certainly luck in the draw of tickets, but it moves fast and it is so enjoyable to play.  This game provides excellent tension and gives a sense of satisfaction as you complete tickets.  It doesn't hurt that the components are great looking and that it is one of my wife's favorite game.

Updated:  OK, this has gotten much less fun over the course of the last few plays.  The flaws are really starting to show for me.  The fun part of the game is placing the little trains, but most of the game is just drawing cards and then waiting while others draw cards.

A simple game, and almost too simple for me.  Still fun when I do play it, which seems to be usually with very, very casual gamers (as in "don't usually play games at all").  These days I seem to enjoy lighter games more and more, though I still want a strategy-fest from time to time.

Another awesome 2 player.  Lots of fun.  Had an awesome experience playing this game with my fiance and her mother on the cape.  My fiance and I had played, her mother had not.  I kept my longer tickets from the beginning, went for all the 15 pointer routes after completing my tickets, and tried to unload to end the game (in the mood to play to win with what I thought to be an advantage, so many points)... but my soon to be mother in law had decided to draw an impossible amount of tickets to complete... I wanted to win that game...

This game is even more fun on-line at the Days of Wonder site. As a boardgame, it's a great gateway for new gamers, but don't let them take too many destination cards. I didn't quite get the concept of how important they were on my first play. Don't have time for a full game... get the dice expansion. It's a nice way to turn your game into a filler.

RATING: 5
Well, it is constant tension, which is kinda fun.  However, I still believe that the initial card draw has more influence on who wins than any other single factor.  I rate it slightly higher for family play (call it a 6), the real knock there being that it is a bit too long for a family game IMO.

Great train game. Fast and fun, easy to learn. Family game. Every one can play it. Since I got Europe before the original Ticket To Ride, I have to say, that Europe is a lot better that the first one. I haven't so far played the Märklin or others, so right now I have to sat, this this is one of the best train games out there, but not as good as Europe version.

Good game. Simple rules but a lot of depth in gameplay. Can be played casually with the family or casual gamers as it is simple to learn. When played with hardcore gamers this game can become a cutthroat experience whith people blocking each other to try to get them to fail some routes. Game stays interesting when played in moderation.

Fun, but can get a bit long at times.  The planning and strategy is fun, and occasionally you are forced to improvise when you get beat to the punch on claiming certain tracks.  It's also interesting how you can play friendly or agressive depending on the group you are gaming with.  My biggest beef is with the claiming of route cards.  For some reason it seems to take players way too long to decide, and if you don't wait they may change their decisions based on what other players do while they're choosing.

I have found that the game has a very wide appeal and many non-gamers will jump right on board for this game.  The rules are simple and the strategies aren't too deep so almost anyone can play.  I should mention that I find the 1910 expansion to be almost a requirement.  Still this game, even without the expansion, is fun and can be played by almost anyone.

Bought it from a friend after playing a few times. Nice game to play with family and friends, who don't like too complex or strategic games. After starting with the card-hoarding tactic and all other players followed, the game wasn't really fun any more. Then everyone in the game was taking 2 cards until there were almost none left and then building stretches requiring 5 or 6 trains to get maximum points.

Probably one of the better casual games I've ever played.  The strategy isn't very intense, although there are certainly tense moments when there is only one route open and you can't be certain if you're racing anyone for it.  I think the tickets add a little too much luck at times (open with a few long routes and you have a big advantage), but let's face it; the game has a lot of luck anyway.  If you can accept that, you should have a blast.  A great gateway game for non-gamers, yet fiercely competitive with experienced gamers.  I've yet to meet somebody who didn't like this.

I think it's an okay game, and I can absolutely understand the appeal. However, I think it is far too dependent on the luck of the draw when it comes to routes, and to a lesser extent train cards. I get that it's a light experience, but it's definitely one of my least favorite of the "classic" examples of modern gateway games. I far prefer Carcassonne, 7 Wonders, and Settlers of Catan, among others. There's too much luck and not enough player interaction (although there is tension when it comes to the race to build, so there is some interaction). Ultimately it just doesn't do it for me. I do think overall it is a nice, solid design, though. And I generally could be convinced to play.

Seems to get high marks from many for sentimental reasons as it is a classic 'gateway'. However, for all the production values there isn't a very deep game here. More like simplified rummy - with a board.

Like it or not, Ticket to Ride is just a little more complex version of the extremely simplistic Transamerica: you still have to connect cities with your railways, even though now you need to play with a more subtle strategy in order to get points for completing routes and avoid point losses for missing tickets.

Anyhow, I find Ticket to Ride is the perfect gateway game for non-gamers, since it’s easy to learn, plays smoothly and in the end it even feels like playing a bigger or harder game as it constantly requires the players to make relevant decisions and overcome new obstacles: its mix of simplicity and complexity is enough for me to make it one of the best games to play with anyone, no matter how much «gamers» they are. [i](September 2011)[/i]

[b]Update I[/b] - In light of the very comment above, in July 2013 I found it proper to raise my rating from 6.5 to 8, which feels better fitting.

[b]Update II[/b] - So many years after my original comment, Ticket to Ride is still both a favorite of the several groups I play with and one of the best games to choose when non-gaming players drop by: hence during my Fall 2015 rating revise I raised my rating from 8 to 9. I still can’t see it reaching 10 though.

Love the simplicity of the original.

Can be *very* cuthroat when played as a 2 player game.  If you think 2 player is boring or its "solitaire", you have to try it out online against some good players.  Be prepared for a chess-like wrestling match.

The train theme is nice too.

I love rail games, but Rail Baron, Empire Builder and the like are very long.  This one is short, quick, and tense. Still my favorite of the three TtR's. 

Or however many there are now.  LOL

I dropped to an 8 as I don't think as highly of it.  It is a great gateway and a game every now and again is always fun.  The ticket draw can be luck and it can decide games.  That is sort of meh to me.

November 2014 - played a couple more times since that last comment.  It settles in at a 9.

RATING: 8.5
One of the best gateway games I've come across. Can be taught in two minutes flat. There are only two options per turn, making it very easy for younger players and uber-casual gamers to understand: Either draw two colored train cards or discard a number cards to lay out trains along a track of corresponding color. 
If you're playing with kids in the 5-7 range, this is the version to get. Not much of a gamer's game unless playing with 4-5 players, or 3+ players if you've got the expansion.

An Essential. Easy to teach, easy to learn, strategic enough to feel "deep" yet relatively simple. In person, online, doesn't matter. One of those games I always say "yes" to. I always have it with me, too, just in case. (yes, same review as Carc, but I feel same here).

Ticket to Ride joins the pantheon of poor SDJ winners, even with the qualification of picking a family game.  This game is just outright boring.  While dissimilar to another Moon SDJ winner Elfenland, both share the same flaw of a lack of player interaction.  Find a better introductory game.

A game that has steadily declined as time goes on.  The more games I play, the less I want to play this one.  I still think it's a good gateway game and I'll play with family or friends, but it's far from my first choice.  It'll probably be fun with the kids when they get a little older, so I'll hang onto it.

I love Ticket to Ride! I judge a game by its simplicity, replayability and decision making, and this game delivers all of it. The finish is always filled with tension!

The 1910 expansion just adds to the enjoyment and variability.

With young kids we ditch the tickets and play the card on the table until they get a match set to play on the board, make them count the cars, say the name of the cities it goes to and I ask them if they know what states the train is going through.

There's just something about this game that I love. I'm racing to build my trains, while desperately hoping someone else doesn't take my track. Everyone I've played with has loved it too, and it's a great intro into the world of modern board games. I'd give it a 10, but there is the possibility of hurt feelings when playing this game, especially when someone is playing to block tracks rather than to get extra destinations, which can put me off it for awhile.

Has some balance issues that the european version fixes very well. Because of that I find this version to be quite frankly outdated, although still very fun, of course.

Great gateway game.  Much preferred by me over Settlers or Carcassonne. I wish the "Tickets" were a little more visible somehow so that competition for links would be more obvious to less experienced players.  Maybe a few "major lines" that are printed on the board like in Railroad Tycoon would make for a more interesting game?  The Ticket deck would be reduced to smaller, less valuable routes, but the major lines are available to all.  Wow, I really like that idea!  I'm sure someone has already thought of it... I wonder how it plays?

Initial 2-player intro fell flat, but subsequent 4/5 player games really saw it shine. Perfect for new gamers but just enough 'meat' for the more experienced player to sink his/her teeth into. A few imbalances in tickets and route points, while not spoiling the game, mean I'm particularly looking forward to TTR: Europe.
***UPDATE*** Downgraded from 8 to 7 as TTR:Europe is now my preferred version. A shame, as it is still a very good game, but I can't see myself playing this when Europe is on offer...

I got this for my wife and for my non-gamer friends and family members. For playing with them it's absolutely a ten. There is a lot more game hidden in this than is advertised by those who would reductively call it a rummy game. While there is that element, it also includes strategic and tactical play, as well as press-your-luck and bluffing mechanics. I feel this a much better gateway game than Settlers or Carcassonne. It is perfect for anyone who wants to play a game with depth and engage others resistant to "designer games." Gamers like myself who usually like a litte more mystery about what is under the hood will find themselves reaching for other games. However, the engine of this game is without a doubt so elegant that you won't find yourself leaving a game of Ticket to Ride unsatisfied. Note: the USA 1910 expansion is probably a required purchase along with the base game.

RATING: 7
15 plays: 

A light game, accessible to kids, able to be cutthroat and intense with skilled players. 

What's great is that it's quick to learn set up, and the turn to turn play is satisfying and flows nicely. There is little analysis paralysis. 

My complaint is that the whole thing doesn't quite add up to more than the sum of its parts. The many colors have no ultimate meaning; they are interchangeable abstractions that have no consistent role on the board. The destinations are arbitrary. Scoring seems almost like an afterthought. 

Also, it just runs a bit long. Flaying with a group of 5 can take 90 minutes, and it's kind of a long 90 minutes because there are sooooo many turns, most of which are just drawing more train cards.

But it's always ready to take off the shelf and play, and one of the most widely flexible games for various ages and skill levels.

Maybe it was just do to our first time playing, but I felt like there was plenty of room for everyone's trains (and we had 5 people playing).  Also, the game seemed very non-confrontational (which is a pro or con depending on your group I'm sure).  This is a game I would play again, but not purchase unless I magically find myself with kids.

RATING: 6.5
I'm not a huge fan of Ticket to Ride.  Fighting over territory is fun, but too many games come down to lucky topdecks off the route cards.  Endings like that just never sit well with me, so it's fallen down my list.

I'd love to try a variant where you cannot draw routes once you place a train, I think it would alleviate my concerns entirely.

Excellent gateway game that is easy for new players to understand and enjoy. This is also one of those rare games where new players can be very competitive against players who have played many times before. While experienced players do have an edge, it isn't such a dominant position that a win is guaranteed for them.

This game is likely to remain in my collection perpetually, especially since the additional maps and variations that have been introduced over the years have provided enough variety to always keep it in play as a choice for my gaming group.

On the surface a pleasant game to spend some time with but once you get to know the game-play and with the right group of players it can be very competitive which will lead to pouting and occasional bad language.

Very light excellent introduction to boardgames, takes about 2 minutes to explain and an hour to play. However its lightness means I don't want to play it all the time ... gets a bit repetitive (alternative maps would help). 

*** Update, have now got TTR:Europe, much much better - tunnels and ferries and stations all help, along with the ticket distribution (everyone gets 1 long route guaranteed, no-one can get 2), can't see me playing this again (might with the 1910 expansion ...)

The only "fixed" board game I can wholeheartedly recommend with a guarantee for infinite replayability. When I say "fixed" board gaming, I'm essentially referring to the kinds of games that don't really contain much of any potential for expansion, or any gameplay mechanics that include any kind of customization. 
The kinds of games we've all played as children, like Life or Monopoly, where nothing changes, it's played the exact same way every single time, and there's no way you can change up the experience or customize it. And that's exactly what makes Ticket to Ride so remarkable, the fact that it's a "fixed" board game that can be replayed indefinitely, something that is exceptionally rare in games of this type.

RATING: 10
Wow!  My opinion of this game has changed a lot from when I entered the hobby.  First, it remains a great gateway game.  However, after being in the hobby for almost 10 years, I find this game much better than most.  First off, there are simple rules so the "how do you play" gets out of the way almost immediately.  However, experienced players will almost always win because knowing the tickets is a huge advantage.  Second off, it's not a multi-player solitaire game like so many modern euros.  To play well, player need to manage risk (choke points, single routes) and pay attention to what other players are collecting.  There's never downtime.  Turns on quick and even when it's someone else's turn, you need to be paying attention.  Third off, with all that said, it's still a great game to play with company over a beer.  

I do like the expansions better (Switzerland, Nordic Countries, and India) but I'd never say no to base game.

Ahhh, one of my favorites of all time.  I will never pass on a game of good ole TTR.  Great for new and seasoned veterens.  This game has hooked many players into board gaming again in my group.  Must own for all!  

*My rating includes the 1910 expansion.  The expansion is a must own and fixes a few minor issues by providing larger train cards and tons of new routes.  It makes completing the smaller "dinker" routes a viable strategy to victory.

This board game app is probably the one that gets played most often. My wife and I both enjoy it and can start up a game pretty much anytime, enjoy it, and move on to whatever is next on our to-do list. I've never played the physical game, but I can only imagine that the setup / breakdown and play via the iPad makes it much more likely for me to play this game regularly. I can't imagine just knocking out a game after dinner without it being an app. I really enjoy this game and love it as an app!

Reminded me a lot of TransAmerica but with very significant added dimension and competitive elements. A lovely game to look at and to play, and one that I think is a great non-threatening offering for people not very familiar with this new genre of board games (Euro- German- Designer- games). 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Another game where iPad exposure led to the greatest familiarity with the rules for me. I do like the game and it is fun to play on the board with the physical pieces. It's a game that gets brought out at family functions and there will always be someone who doesn't know or who has forgotten the rules, but usually, the inquiries are minor and resolved quickly by the fairly clear instructions or a more familiar player.

This game serves as a reminder that instant karma is alive and well. My girlfriend plays nice - she politely lets me complete routes even when it's obvious what I am up to.

Like I said, she's nice.

I'm less nice, and I do enjoy claiming that one route train between Seattle and Portland [i]just in case[/i] you might be headed there, you know.

She beats me so mercilessly at this game it is not even funny. I think the severity of the beatings have turned me into the spiteful route grabber I am today. I'm the true victim here.

This one is a great, light game for the naughty and nice alike.  Choo-chooooo!

Short on complexity, but long on fun. All ages enjoy this game. Destination cards "separate the men from the boys." Blocking other players' routes steps up the competition to another level. The players decide at what level they will compete (interfere with other player's lines). Still, careful planning is needed when deciding how many routes to connect. We play the rule in TtRE that everyone starts with one long destination.  Good game design and simple mechanics = an 8 rating.

Good game. Will definitely end up being seen as an absolute classic. It already is. One note though: As a house rule, divide the tickets/missions into 5-11 tickets and 12+ tickets, or else the game almost always ends up beeing about building all the long rutes instead of trying out ticket missions.

I used to own TTR:Europe, but have since traded back with my Sister for the original.  For me, I just love the simplicity and more cut-throat nature of the original.

This was kind of neat at first, but really frustrating to see the colors you need come up and get taken before it's your turn.  I like the concept of blocking the routes, but it feels like this can happen too gratuitously and totally ruin someone's chances to win.

Excellent boardgame, very addictive gameplay.  The cards are a bit tiny, but they do the job.  No dice in this one, and the game is easy to learn, even for children.

I've heard many places that this is a good beginner game, and I agree--the gameplay is simple, so much so that at first you wouldn't expect this game to offer so much. Turns go quickly, which generally makes this game much more bearable, time-wise, than Settlers or the like can be. I've discovered the most enjoyable way to play this (without squabbling with other players) is to play with three or four players; at five, this game really turns into fighting over a few key paths. I've also discovered that an effective strategy is to save cards and build up for your biggest paths first, rather than placing down the small tracks first, as it becomes harder and harder to claim certain routes later in the game. Still, I've not managed to ever win this one, which perhaps makes me a little more hesitant to play this than previously.

This is a great intro game for beginner gamers.

A great game with any number of players, although better with more than two.  The quality is fantastic, Days of Wonder's stock is rising for me after MM'44 and this - I'm seriously considering Pirate's Cove and Mystery of the Abbey now!  EXCELLENT GAME!!!

I just played TTR for the first time.  I love how different this game is from all the other games I play.  There are no dice, turns move quickly, and you have to keep thinking ahead about how you will complete your paths.  Because turn times are so short, I would consider making a house rule that you can draw and build once in the same turn... I'm not sure how that would affect game play other than speed it up.  Hopefully I will get to play again soon :)

Nice light fun game.  Winning is a bit too dependant on which tickets you draw though.  I wish it were more competitive, but our group doesn't play it that way - blocking someone is too much trouble, when your opponent can easily find another way around.  Great game for newbies.

Our family gateway game, which funnily enough started with the iOS version.  It was free at the time too, but with the money spent on games since then I realize it was very far from free.  For nostalgia purposes alone, this will always own a special place for me and I will never turn down a game.  Extremely accessible for new players.  I taught my sister and brother-in-law the game and they immediately went out and bought it.  If you do pick it up, ensure that you get the USA 1910 expansion as well.  I find the bigger train cards and additional routes are a huge addition.

First time was on XBLA which made me want to purchase the actual board game, despite the fact that there were already a number of other TtR implementations out there. (Hey, what can I say?

I bought this to play with an eight year old, but it's not fun since she can't grasp route blocking and long-term planning.  Probably better with adults, but not much.   Just not my cup of tea.

This game always makes my thumb hurt from trying to hold too many cards in a way that I can see them all!  The cards win or lose the game for you.

Ticket to Ride is perfection in a box, if only perfection came with stupidly small cards. After 1910, the cards were fixed, making Ticket to Ride the perfection in a box that it always claimed to be. The game is simple, lucky and strategic, with a theme that fits the game perfectly. It plays in a short timeframe and it truly does feel like a game that everyone can enjoy.

My gateway game. Have played with the husband, niece and nephew (11 and 9), sister, mother, sister-in-law, mother-in-law, and several friends. All have enjoyed themselves. After dozens and dozens of plays I still never tire of it.

I prefer Märklin but I like the U.S. map because of the abundance of six-car routes. Days of Wonder really needs an events expansion to spice up the gameplay, though, because the board loses its luster after too many plays. How about adding labor strikes, natural disasters, crashes, service repairs? Something to add some variety to an already great game.

UPDATE II - My now 8- and 10-year-olds both prefer TTR: Europe, and so do my wife and I.

UPDATE - I have upped my rating since I found out how much fun this game is to play with my 7- and 5-year-olds.  They crave the game, and with a minor handicap (they can play on both routes at any time, while I have to play by the standard three-player rules) it is challenging for all of us.

This is a good game, and it fits my taste, but I'm not sure it's perfect or a SDJ lock.  One issue I have is that the game tension, while strong, isn't strategic.  Luck plays a large factor in the game, as card arrival is the main component of TWO game factors - resources and goals.  I will play this often, but likely not for more than 6 months or so.  As for SDJ... well, Alhambra won, so I guess this one could win and still be a better choice than 2003.  Days of Wonder bits and boxes are still the top of the heap in production.

RATING: 8
At the risk of sounding cliche....  As a noob I really have/had no expectations for any of these games.  TTR is a game that shows up on every must own list as well as every "gateway" list.  After a dozen or so family plays, several one on ones, and an App purchase I can only be added to the list of people praising this game.  While I have not played enough games (yet) to have an opinion on "Best Game" my opinion of TTR is that it has "enough" to be played often. "Enough" what?  Enough strategy, enough press your luck, enough randomness, enough theme, enough...fun.  Ultimately that's it, fun.  This game is fun.

Better with 3 than with 2. Somewhat quiet game. UPDATE: Very quiet during the game (again with fewer players), when you're not sure what your opponents are doing, and you're just pulling cards hoping to get the right combos. It doesn't quite have the tension I was hoping for. UPDATE2: Wow, this game is a lot more fun when you win! Also, the end-of-game scoring (with each player revealing their destination tickets one by one) can be more fun than the game itself. UPDATE3: This game is [i]much[/i] better with 5. In fact, I would rarely want to play with less (maybe 4 is ok).

    Trains were a nice touch
Always gets asked for

My opinion of this game keeps going down each time I play it. The theme/game disconnect is just too wide. Ticket to Ride is really just a melding game with complicated and misleading scoring; the rewards for completing routes (via the ticket cards) are not sensibly given out.
---
I am wierdly conflicted on Ticket to Ride.

To me, this seems to be a game that is clearly in the American style. That is to say, it's winning converts based on being a) familiar through its melding-game heritage, b) modestly engaging, and c) pretty much non-threatening. That's cool, but leaves it a bit in the margins for the gamer who is a fan of much more sophisticated German games like Beowulf, Settlers, Modern Art, etc. You can tell this is not a Knizia because of the impressive imbalances between the various activities - tickets are a sucker play, you want to just put down large routes. This is at least partly because the value of each ticket is just the number of trains required to complete it, without any regard to difficulty whatsoever - a route that contains many short links in a central, contested area is going to be vastly more difficult and more expensive to complete than one containing a few long links on the periperies. Thus, getting a ticket for the long northern or southern routes is a ticket to victory, and drawing tickets is a very risky sucker play. This is a double-whammy because it kills the theme - anyone who mistakes this for a route-building game instead of a point-scoring game is screwed.

Where does that leave me on Ticket to Ride? If I was going to play an "experience" game with a large chaos element, I'd rather do a game with a fun factor, like Liar's Dice or Pitchcar or Nuclear War. I've never been clear where the fun factor is with Ticket to Ride, which is why I never recommend it, even as a "gateway" game. In fairness, there is more to engage the intellect in Ticket to Ride than in many low-brainpower games, but in this class I'd definitely prefer the less-fiddly, less time-consuming Reibach (Get the Goods) or High Society or For Sale, or at the very least something with a minimally functioning theme. Ticket to Ride also has a problem with limited replayability, rapidly becoming pretty samey - much moreso than similar weight class games like Carcassonne: Hunters & Gatherers or Through the Desert.

All this is not to say that Ticket to Ride is a bad game; it's not. It's a decent game, it works, it's attractive, it's easy to play, and so on. But for me personally, it's just too bland. Too long to make a virtue of brevity or simplicity, yet too light to be really engaging. Even after all these years, give me Settlers any day.

My first thought of this game was there's no way I'm purchasing this.  The theme completely turned me off and the board itself is one of the least appealing looking ones I've ever seen, but after much research I'm glad I purchased it.  My teenage son loves it, my wife loves it, and I love it.  Great mechanic.  Original board game.  Reminds me of the card game "Rummy" slightly but MUCH better.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A decent light-weight route building game, where you draft cards hoping to form sets that allow you to place routes.  You have a hand of ticket cards showing connections you need to make with those routes you're placing.  Make the connection to score points, but if you don't you'll lose the points!

Lots of fun with lots of very tense moments as the board gets crowded and potential routes are cut off by your opponents.  You can also gamble on taking extra tickets, but if you draw poorly, you might really get screwed into getting tickets you can't complete!  So, overall, the tension here is very good.

Overall, a light game that is still very enjoyable despite the simplicity.  Great for introducing people to the hobby.

One of the most popular gateway games with very good reasons. The game is perfect to introduce new gamers to the hobby with its simple rules and colorful components. I love the secret route goals players try to complete during the game and there is just enough competition for the limited routes to make the game enjoyable for all. Although the Europe version has a few more interesting rules, I prefer the original for its simplicity and the familiarity of the U.S. map. A great choice for families or for people wanting to try modern board games.

Great family game! Accessible. Played in reasonable time. Rather nice graphics. After having played Settlers to death with my family, this might be the way to go from now on. That said, you need 4+ players for the game to become really interesting.

Worthy Spiel des Jahres winner. True to the parameters of that prize. 

[6/11/2006] While all the above holds true, such light family boardgames aren't really a genre I'm too interested in. Further, the Europe edition is more interesting in my book.

RATING: 6
With two players this is a dull set collection game that feels a lot like solitaire. I find you really need five players to experience tension, less than five and I find any feel any reason to lay track. With five and I lay track because I'm worried that I'll get blocked out of the best route, or possibly be unable to even complete my route.

I prefer the Europe variant as it ensures a better distribution of the long tracks and the Stations diminish the tension just a bit of getting blocked out, which is nice. Not a fan of the tunnels though.

RATING: 4
TtR is fine, but boring. Draw cards, lay cards down, claim points, draw more cards, round and round. Static. Dull. Kids and nongamers seem to really enjoy it so I will keep it around, but I would never seek out a game of TtR. There is a bit of strategy, but I usually turn my mind and just grab cards and lay track...and play fast so we can move on to something else.

While this is definitely a very simple game, Ticket to Ride is great for what it is and fills a (to me) important niche. It's simple and aesthetically pleasing enough that non-gamers are usually willing to give it a go, and it's still fun for gamers in the mood for a light, quick game. This goes super, super fast with an experienced group, making the luck factor a non-issue for me. I actually played this AFTER the other games in the series, but I enjoy this one the most. The map and lack of stations/passengers make it the most cutthroat, and the simplicity of the rules makes it the ideal choice for non-gamers.

RATING: 3
I am not so sure why this game is rated that high.  

Production: great quality, sturdy box, nice illustrations, not very realistic geography wise. 

Rules and mechanic: not much, the whole game is about three or four rules. you exchange cards for trains and claim so-called "routes." Very, very abstract. And while abstract, no big strategy either. Emotion wise it is overally a negative game.  All you need to do is to cut the other person, that'd be the basically the major strategy.   

I am not a uber-board gamer; however, this game is far too dry for any kind of taste.  We have tried with 2-3 people, no difference. As boring as it gets.  I am looking other RR games, such as Railways of the World, or Steam, even a crayon game, Empire Builder "awesome map!."  Maybe my mistake was to think this as a RR game. 

Avoid.

Some friends have a copy of this, and if they want to play it, I'm okay getting it out. One that I don't feel it necessary to own, even though it's been a huge on in getting people into the hobby. 

This is a great gateway game, simple mechanics, engaging enough theme, and just a tiny bit of the screw your neighbor aspect when you play routes that other people need and are obviously going for. It's kinda fun, but I think it's a bit overplayed.

One of my all time favorite games.  Easy to learn and great for introducing people to the world of gaming.  A 2 player game is fun, light and casual with minimal difficulty.  A 4 player makes things a lot more interesting because it increases the difficulty due to the increased risk of your route being blocked by other players.  You have to act quickly on your routes if you want to complete your ticket!

RATING: 7.5
Often recommended as a "gateway" Euro, this Alan Moon favourite belongs in any Eurogamer's collection.  The set collection, network building, and completion of specified routes are easy enough for an eight-year-old to comprehend, but the optimal mix of the three is constantly shifting; the simplicity of the rules belies the depth of strategic and tactical considerations that arise during a game.  The amount of player interaction and confrontation varies depending on the number and/or experience of the players - beginners (or crybabies) can play a soft game, keeping out of each other's way, while more seasoned gamers can play hardball, blocking routes, snapping up train cards needed by their opponents, and generally trying to fuck things up for other players.  Definitely one of the first games that should be introduced to any budding Eurogamer, and one that will likely be a lifelong companion.

Got this to play with my young kids, though they're not old enough yet. Looks like it'll be good for that, I struggle with how to rate games sometimes. This obviously is not the same type of game as my favorite, HRC, but do I rate them the same way? They're not trying to do the same thing. This game does what it's trying to do pretty well, so in some ways it could be rated even higher.

RATING: 8
This is hands down *THE BEST* gateway game in existence! It's the very first game I introduce new people to if they haven't played board games before - and it has been a huge succes every single time! I have managed to get people so hooked on board games that they have requested to play more games which is obviously great. Many of these persons have even bought TtR themselves!

So, if I should rate it by popularity, it would get a 9 or so, but the fact that it's so easy for non-gamers to understand is also the downside for me; I would like just a bit more to think about than drawing two cards or lay down train cars (or take new route cards). 

Rating is including the expansion Ticket to Ride: USA 1910 which I always play with. Otherwise the rating would probably drop a little.

It never fails to impress new players - it's so easy to explain and understand, it looks great, there is some tense decision-making going on, and even the losing players feel that they have accomplished something when the game is over (due to the train tracks; they start with nothing but end up with a lot of trains on the board).

RATING: 10
I have come to really appreciate the game for the addictive joy that it is. It is a great gateway because it's simple, beautiful, and has a very positive first play experience. But please stop saying this is "just" a gateway game. Yes, it is an amazing game to introduce people to the hobby, but it is more than a simple game when experienced players sit down to play. Deep? Maybe not, but fully engaging to a player choosing to track every detail.  

I do think in every way that it is a landmark for the hobby and that was clear from the very beginning. My first set of cards are nearly ragged. And sharing it with my students was a great joy. 

The tension can be palpable with some groups, and yet I can play loose with others. I love that range of experience based on my fellow players. Those who say it is all luck fail to regard how you can play your way out of any hand by knowing the game and watching the other players. The best players win much, much more often---but not so much that a new player can't pull a game out. The group I play this with make me proud to play games because anyone can win and people can still play with a personal style. That's a very high compliment in my book!

Tense and quick-playing - I really enjoy this game.  The online implementation at daysofwonder.com is very good.  A friend of mine complained that whoever gets the west-east connection wins.  While that is an advantage, it's not insurmountable; first of all, there is more than one east-west connection; second, you can block some of the straight shots, especially the southern route, fairly easily.

My go-to gateway "family" game.  Basic intro into modern board games with just enough strategy to keep me interested each time I play.

Rules and turns are very simple - either take two cards, or turn in some card to build a train.  Longer trains = more points, and don't forget to build the route for your ticket.

I know there are a ton of other maps out there, but I have never felt the need to go beyond the basic America map.  Once players get the feel for the game and mechanics I think it can get a bit dry.

**Had many plays before logging.

Ok, what can I say, I hate this game. It's way too luck based and has too much "guided" strategy, since your strategy is hindered by what cards you can randomly acquire.

My first "gateway game" purchase... in Dec. 2008.

This is the ultimate gateway game. I have not yet found a person that did not like this game at least a little bit. I still enjoy it, even though I'm increasingly attracted to more difficult games.

This is a definite keeper and a great means for introducing new people to board games.

Update: Just played this game with three other "gamers" familiar with TTR, and it was still very enjoyable... possibly even more so with the increased competition. Yes, this is a "gateway" game, but that's not to suggest that the game's limit is for introducing newbies. TTR can stand on its own. I've dropped the rating to a "7", but only because I've played this many more times prior to my official effort to log games. I'm not actively suggesting it, but I certainly won't turn down a game.

My gateway game to the hobby so it has a special place in my heart. Europe may be better, but the US map is still very popular and the game just plays so smoothly. You can play non-aggressive with friends and family, but gamers can cut everyone's routes off and be quite mean. Just a wonderful game.

Received as a Christmas present.  I like this game, but I don't think I like it as much as it seems to be hyped.  There just doesn't seem to be much to it--though I enjoy other games that are of the same length but just as simple, so I don't know.  If I'm in for a game in the 1 hour range, this isn't too bad of an option, but it's not my favorite.

All time favorite "signifigant other" game.  Introduces non-gamers into german board games with a really nice game that has great production quality.  This is a must have for any board gamer.

RATING: 8.5
A great game that has the unique ability to greatly satisfy both casual gamers and strategy gamers. The mechanics are a little slow, but overall quite brilliant. While this game is always fun, having to complete your plans one step at a time while hoping other players don't cut you off can make the game way more stressful than is necessary sometimes. On the other hand, the tension and timing are largely what define the greatest aspects of the game mechanics.

We loved this game from the very first time we played it, and haven't grown the least bit tired of it.  It can be tense trying to decide whether to play cards now, and lock in points, or take cards you will need later.  We've played with 2 or 3 players, and found it worked equally well either way.  We easily explained it to someone with little gaming experience.

Only played it once, but didn't really like it.  I;m not a fan of the secret ticket thing at the end. I felt like this game is overrated. As popular as it is, I don't know why it has a price tag of $50.  There's nothing in the box for the number of copies it claims to have sold to cost that much.

RATING: 5
Recent boardgame convert. I've got some of the basics - Carcassone, Settlers, San Juan, and some abstracts. I got this one to suck in some of my friends since it is the simplest of the top rated games and has such a reputation as a gateway game, but it is my least favorite. Not enough interaction, but I like the tension. Maybe I'll like it more with more players. So far just 2 and 3.

TransAmerica plus a couple, just not plus a very large couple.  More complex/intricate than Coloretto but with the same or lower decision density and complexity and without anything to compare to Coloretto's interesting concentration on card counting.

Had much more fun playing this than I thought I would.  Went over very well with my wife, and the play with two was decent as well.  Not the deepest game, but I enjoyed it much more than Transamerica.  I think Union Pacific beats it out, however.  At least if you have five or six players!  Also, Union Pacific really isn't that much more complex.  Still, this game is great fun!  UPDATE:  I still like this game, but I don't play it much with the regular group given our disposition to more heavy-weight games (which I favor).  I like it best as a two-player with my wife, or with those new to gaming.

When you're a parent there's always a deck of playing cards around, you tend to play cards with your kids.  There's more interaction and bonding time, and it gets their Critical Thinking engine running.  At some point you're going to teach them Rummy.  Once they get that down, this Train Builder is a good boardgame intro that uses a Rummy style mechanic.  Its also a good intro for the non-gamer adult who wants to play Rummy to crack them out of the rock they've been living under.  ;-)

Classic family style game. Easy to play with some strategy. Ticket To Ride Europe might be a little more fun to play because of the condensed board.

Great family game that is always full of fun.  Light, yet tense and easy to learn.  It's best with five players, as this adds to the 'claustrophobia' of two players needing the same route.  A fair amount of luck keeps everyone in the game, but unfortunately does not allow for any serious strategy.

I played this version of Ticket to Ride after having already played TtR Europe. I prefer TtR Europe due to the tunnels and ferries and the layout of the tracks - USA is very rectangular but this can make for a somewhat more ruthless game (which is not a bad thing).

I was glad that when I bought this for my sister I also bought the 1910 expansion because the cards are so small in the base game! (They may have changed this by now, I bought the game in early 2011)

All in all this is a very good game, and the US map is easier to teach people who are new to TtR or games in general.

RATING: 8
My preferred gateway game when introducing new players to the boardgame world.  They all seem to struggle with the "take 1 of 3 actions" but quickly get the hang of it and are usually hooked after one play.

The only downside to this game is it only supports 5 players and my typical group is 6.  Luckily, we have a copy of Union Pacific, which is similar enough but a much more enriching game.

Plays very well 2-5 players. Yes, a great gateway game, have introduced this to several non-gamers, and will do again. It's weakness is game balance(if you don't get the long Destination Tickets right off you're at a real disadvantage); the 1910 expansion deals with this, but doesn't solve it altogether.

For some reason, this one has never really captured my imagination as I thought it should.  This is really a rummy variant.  I think it is best at 3 players, where you can easily block players because the double lines into cities are not in play.

Most of my plays really seem to come down to who can lay that one big line across the country, and then branch off of that line to complete their other routes.  Maybe this is just group think with the people I play with?

I have won all but one of the ten or so games I have played. There is very little player interaction unless you predict other people's destination tickets, but getting those moments where a player is completely blocked off and you know you were the cause of it is so satisfying.

With my kids (5,7,10) this one is a clear favorite.  We play it constantly and it never seems to get old.  It also seems that every time the kids have a friend over, this is the first game my kids want to teach their friends.

I moved this from a 9 to a 10 based on how frequently we play it, how much my kids like it, and the reaction from others trying it out for the first time.

Nearly every time we play, my daughter ends up with the longest route 10+ bonus and in a large majority of the games, that either pushes her ahead for a victory or solidifies her already substantial lead.

Very fun game and we're looking forward to the 1910 expansion.

I don't have anything bad to say about Ticket to Ride....I just don't have much good to say about it either.  Its very accessible to casual gamers and Days of Wonders makes quality components.  I've thought about getting this to play with the Monopoly crowd...but I think I'd rather take the risk of trying something a little more compelling.  

After more time and a few more playings, this one is starting to grow on me. Its fairly chaotic with the tickets, but for the casual gaming crowd that is probably a good thing. We've had fun playing this one with relatives who don't game a lot. I would never pull this out with the gaming group, though.

RATING: 5
While I see the appeal as a super complexity-light gateway game, I simply don't feel the love for "Ticket to Ride" that so many others profess. One problem is that, too often, I feel like I'm playing on an island. I take my turn and then just sit around waiting for everyone else, vaguely hoping they don't take the track I want. When my turn comes around, what interesting choices do I have to make? Take two cards or claim a route. That's it. And it's not like things get more interesting later on - they just get more crowded. That's not enough to excite me. I can see playing this game with a friend who simply loves it, but I'd never elect to put it on my table.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A fairly average set collecting / drafting card game with an often unessential board. In theory, the routes on the board add tension and uncertainty, but unless you have a full table there is little room for defensive play, which made this strangely feel like a solitaire game in that any time a player thwarted another, except in extremely rare circumstances, it was circumstantial. 

A bit of room for good play: drawing cards to prevent changing the face up pile, and getting a huge hand and then creating a huge run of 6 links, and it seems the choice between short and long tickets, and long runs vs. quantity of tickets is decently balanced. 

Very little tension most of the time though, pick up a card, pick up a card, lay out several cards, accidentally screw someone along the way. Note that I am more fond of the later Nordic variant that has few enough routes to make this actually competitive in many situations, even with only 2, and especially with 3. This original version of the game really requires a fullish table to have any sense of competition.

(Note that Elfengold has many of the good things about TtR while adding many more gamer friendly aspects such as auctions and opportunities to screw with your opponents. I suggest it by a wide margin over this lighter implementation of a 'route planning' game...and if you really want something light in this vein on the cheap I recommend Canasta, all it takes is two Bicycle decks!)

I have enjoyed this game for what it is. Part of my enjoyment was as an entry into gaming for myself and my family. My wife enjoys it more than I do, but I would rarely turn down a game and often bring it to the table myself because I know she will like it. It's simple. It's elegant. It's fun. It really hits that light to light-medium mark very well, and who doesn't enjoy trains.

RATING: 6
Another game concept that is fantastic, cut down in it's prime by over reliance on random factors in determining the final result.  Random what cards you get, but more importantly are the tickets you draw.  If one player draws two overlapping results, that player will win.  If another player has no overlap, that player will lose.  Still, very accessible, very entertaining game.

I love it that people who have reviewed this game praise it to the heavens but then turn around and snobbishly sniff at other games that "don't bring anything new to the table".  OK, this is Alan Moon's 36th (?) reuse of the same theme, mechanics, and scoring methods and this is somehow "new"?  I think they just like the pretty pictures.  This is a well-designed game, sure, but it's pointless to waste another hour on it when that hour could be applied to something meaningful and thought-provoking.  Like most recent German-style games, this has little replay value or depth and that ultimately is a better barometer of a game's merit than anything else.  As far as its accessibility, there was a time when gamers got into the hobby through Axis and Allies or Civilization...this game might as well be Candyland compared to those.  In fact, this game is evidence that if Candyland were released today, fat bearded men and their grotesquely obese wives would be hunkered over it declaring how "clever" and "elegant" the mechanics are- just like they do with TTR.

You really need to twist my arm to get me to play this.  The winning strategy is to hoard cards and play big routes.  The only real strategy is completing your destinations, which is actually sort of luck based.  Blocking is way too difficulkt to make it worth while unless you are also competing your routes.  So the game just turns into "i draw two cards" over and over again, then play a bunch, maybe grab destinations a second time, game over.  I don't even think this is a good entry game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I was and still am dissappointed with this game. It should/could be a 9 for me. Let me explain why. I feel very strongly that the bonuses for completing your rail links between cities is too small. In game play terms I'd add about a 25-50% to the value of the bonus to every city card. You could do this by adding 5 to every card or use a percentage as above. If you added say 30% a 10 would be worth 13. As the game sits its mainly about getting a east to west rail line using as many 5 or 6 link sections as you can. There is virtually no way you can win without using large links. I played a game where I drew mainly north south runs in the east. I completed 7 of 8 but as it turns out even if I'd completed 8 of 8 I still would have lost. This just doesn't seem right. A train game should primarily reward you for building clever rail lines not just a big sections where ever. If you wish you can overlook this completely and play it as a pure strategy game and have fun but I think it still limits the strategic options to one rather than two.

New Idea: I might try a strategy which is to keep two small runs which you can complete easily and focus on playing a mainly defensive strategy to stop others from connecting their big runs. If you get help from one or two other players who may also try this strategy, then completing a big run becomes difficult. This should nicely balance things out. If you really mess with one guy early he will have no choice but to join you in stopping someone else when he is not going to make his big runs. Then this can landslide to 3 or 4 people stopping the last one or two people trying for the big connection.

This game feels like an 'Old Faithful' to me. It gets played frequently, and I often use it to introduce people who say they don't like games, to the wonderful world of boardgames. 

It's easy to learn, easy to play, but still has enough strategy involved that it can get really difficult when playing with the right group of people.

I'd recommend picking this up (or one of it's descendents) to anyone, and any level of gamer.

3rd boardgame I have bought since started my hobby, but it was the first Euro game I have played. I bought this for to play at party with my relatives, who do like games, like Pit, Pictionary, etc but aren't familar with Euro games. It was ver easy to teach and it went over well everything but the session was a little long with 5 new players, like 2 hours, but since it was our first time, that was understandable. While I thought it was a little light, as compared with my experience with playing Last Night On Earth, which I loved, I did like it as I could see the strategies in the game. My cousins especially really liked the game and wanted to play in the future so it was a successful hit with my relatives, and I got them excited to play other games I think, just like a good gateway game should do. If I had a choice, I'd play Downfall of Pompeii as the first gateway game, as it's quicker, and has a better theme.

Ticket to Ride is the perfect gateway game into the world of strategy board gaming. I taught Ticket to Ride to about a dozen couples who only knew games like Monopoly, and every couple loved the game. It's simple game with a train-based theme. All you do is draw colored cards and then discard those cards to lay your train track needed to complete your assignments, or tickets, from, say, London to Berlin.

Once you learn the game, however, you'll discover a few flaws. First, the cards themselves are too small and thus hard to handle, especially since there is no hand limit. Second, there's too much luck involved with what tickets you draw. Put simply, some tickets produce a lot more points than other tickets.

But the 1910 expansion comes to the rescue. With the expansion, you can replace the small cards with the big ones. And the additional tickets reduce the luck factor.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
There's very little direct competition in this version because there's plenty of room to maneuver and everyone is usually just worried about their own routes unless there's some obvious and easy way to block someone else's route.  If you try to block someone, they usually have 2 or 3 or 4 outs and so it's you who pays the bigger price in that they lose little in development time and you've lost whatever you've invested on your own development.  It's a good family game.  Experience is a huge bonus.  Memorizing the common cities used helps in figuring out what the opponent is doing and also there are several places on the map that are commonly sought after.

Finally purchased it and played it with my family. Was worried that it wouldn't live up to all the hype. Family enjoyed it, but didn't love it. Fun game. Held everyone's attention. Lots of planning and strategizing and yelling (jokingly?) at each other for taking cards or routes. Lots of strategy without being too difficult. Components are eye-catching and high quality. While not the first game we have played with a sort of "get you" mechanism, is probably the one that has it the strongest. I think this game may not be pulled off the shelf very often - there are many games my family loves that they would rather play and some of the scoring mechanisms get a bit confusing for the family.

Good game that can be taught easily. I prefer Ticket to Ride: Europe as I think the tunnels and stations add more to the game. 

13/10/2012 - I own this one after I got is as a present, and played it with my family. While I still prefer Ticket to Ride: Europe, I found this version very easy to teach to four other new players without the added complications of tunnels and stations. The game was extremely close (the three top final scores were only separated by one point) and the blocking element of this version was fun to play, particularly with five players.

For this, I rate it a "10" and I'm happy to bring it out any time - especially if it gives me a chance to introduce someone new to this genre of games.
TTR is my gateway game that I bought 4 years ago for my "trainiac" son and pulled out a few months ago as he is finally old enough to play it.  Can't believe it sat on the shelf for that long and I didn't realize what we had -- oh the wasted time! Highly recommended family game with only one page of easy to follow illustrated rules.  Welcome to the addiction - we're glad you're here.  :)

Broad appeal to non-gamers and light gamers. A little too much luck for my taste. My personal rating is 7, but I'll bump it up to 8 because it is THE gateway game to introduce to non-gamers - a very significant asset to the hobby.

tense fight over available routes, with added debate whether to take more ticket cards and attempt to connect more routes.  very short turns too and very accessible to non-gamers.

This game was definitely the most popular game I owned when my collection was smaller. It got three dedicated non-gamers in my family to play, enjoy, and ponder future plays of "Trains". My copy's been played by at least a couple dozen different people, young and old, and everyone's liked it.

Over time, my appreciation for this game has grown tremendously.  Suitable for just about any group, it plays quick and doesn't overstay its welcome. 

Its as simple as any other gateway game, yet manages to make for an exciting, and tense experience every time.  A consistently better gateway then most of the other widely accepted ones.

RATING: 8
As with so many other gamers, this game is the ONE that got me into boardgames again.  For that reason it will always have a very special place in my heart.  It is a gateway game with surprisingly deep strategy and a very cutthroat feel.  The energy and suspense in this game is relentless from beginning to end.  My mom loved this game, and she is a very far cry from being a game-lover.  This game would be a ten, but because it was my introduction to the hobby, it got a bit overplayed.  I predict that in the future it will be hailed as "The Monopoly of the 2000s".  It is the first game I recommend to those new to the hobby.

This game is great! Very easy to learn, and doesn't take too long to play. Great for introducing to non-gamers. Not too much confrontation with two players, but the Big cities variant (introduced by USA 1910 expansion) makes it a whole lot more exciting.

It's horrible to see how fast this can be a great hit with nongamers. Both my dad, and my boyfriend's parents and sister + boyfriend, and his brother + girlfriend are now addicted to TTR.

They are so excited with the game, that they decided not to return it to us :P unless we come and eat with them..so they can play it :P

I've played this game three or four times and the family enjoys it more than me.  There's something about the rules that just doesn't feel quite right -- but I can't put my finger on what it is.

Played once at Spiel 2004, but I forgot most of the experience. I do remember thinking it had a lot in common with Transamerica (connecting cities, getting cards to do so), but I disliked the secret assignments, which could really ruin your game without you able to do much about it. The fact that I forgot about this game until many months later really says it all.

I don't know what kind of freakish mantis alien these cards were designed for.  My feeble humanoid attempts to shuffle resulted in card explosions.  Very fun game, but buy the 1910 expansion unless you have delicate little needle fingers.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
For me, this is the best franchise to introduce new players to designer games.   I prefer the Europe version to the original only because of the depots.  The US map can be unforgiving, especially the Vegas connection.  Get it early.

MUST be played with the 1910 expansion, in my opinion.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
This is the first game I bought after finding BGG.  This game has received a lot of plays when we first got it.  Still like it a lot and the kids like it too.  Including the 1810 expansion is a must for both the increased options of play and the larger card size.  Of all the TTR options, this one is still the best. 

Probably the best gateway game for new players.  However, once you get over the TTR glow, you start looking for more complexity.  Anytime I try to introduce people to the games I play, this one comes out.

Wife gets really frustrated if I block her.  Need to learn to not do that in the future.  Some games are for deep strategy and others are just for fun.

I would only ever bring out my copy if someone new to gaming asked me to, and only under duress. The game is too simple for my tastes and I really dislike the fact that you can accidentally destroy someone with your placement of routes. The fact that playing it strategically involves wilfully doing so makes it all the more frustrating. I don't mind games where you can screw each other over so long as it is easy to reciprocate. Having played TTR Europe I would never willingly play TTR again.

RATING: 8
Very enjoyable, surprisingly stressful.

This game feels very unique, and the concept is refreshingly  un-confrontational. The stress comes from trying not to give away the cities you are trying to connect, whilst desperately trying to aquire your sixth coal carriage.

Surprisingly easy to pick up and play, whilst also feeling reasonably deep.

Easy game to learn for just about anyone. Individual strategies are difficult for other to guess at, and the Draw OR Play mechanic stops people from overrunning the game.

Connect cities to gain points, and complete Destination Tickets for even more. The only score that eveeryone knows is what you get for placing trains, leading to a dramatic change in victors as the Destination Tickets are added/subtracted at the end of the game.

Highly recommended!

Simplistic euro style game for building railroads across the United States.  Complete routes to score special cards,  work for the longest route, and build as much track as you can before the game ends.  This game plays fast with little down time.  The game is neat looking and the plastic trains are cool.  This is easy to teach others and fun to play.  There's no dice in Ticket to Ride and the only variability is in card draw for scoring points or building track.  Several expansions now exist.

Would be better if there were some dice rolling, or a way to charge other players for using your route. Maybe a deck of cards that did some random things when you used a certain route...

RATING: 8.5
This is a great gateway game. Also, aside of Magic the Gathering, it is the most played game I own (counting all expansions together).
The core of the game is to fulfill set of tickets - connect two cities on the ticket with the train route. You do this by collecting train cards of different colors and claiming routes by placing number of trains according to their length. 
This is the core set of the game with no additional rules covering USA territory. The strategy is usually to connect the west with east to make one long route ideally. I strongly recommend to add USA 1910 expansion and play megagame variant - shuffling all tickets together and having 10p bonus for longest track and 15p for the most tickets completed.

What I like:
- easy, not brain burning, perfect for the new people in the hobby, Ideal game to pick when you want to introduce board gaming.
- You feel you have actually building something, and when completing all your tickets, it feels somehow good.
- Nice components, artwork is great (in all maps in series general)
- this version I pick when I just need to relax, play without any additional rules introduced in later versions.

What I dislike:
- Sometimes the game is too luck dependent - you desperately need the fifth green train taking again and again cards from the top and not seeing any card you need while opponent draws one locomotive (bonus train) after another. This issue can be partially overdone by good planning and preparing your tracks for the future.
- As this is light gateway game, don't expect some hard brain work, the gaming experience is very casual.

Great Classic game. We've played this game a lot over the years. 
	• The "1910" add-on is important in that it replaces the annoying little cards from the first game with nice big cards
	• The game artwork is beautiful and colorful. 
	• Players as young as 7 can play - although with a fair amount of help.

Ticket to Ride is the BEST gateway game out there.  I don't even think it's close.  Newbies are going to be able to pick this one up in a heartbeat but will probably get destroyed by board game veterans...the reason being is this game has so much hidden depth.  There is little to no luck in this game and it's highly strategic (aside from starting destination tickets).  Every route you connect matters.  There's also a great dash of tactical play with taking cards you know your opponent needs and laying routes that block your opponents.  There's a great amount of tension in between your turns where you are sweating if someone is going to take the card you want or lay a route that you needed.  Highly recommend this game to everyone!

Reminded me of Elfenland a little, even though people categorically deny that similarity.   Edit: After repeated plays this kind of grows on you.  Upgraded my rating to reflect.

Great gateway game. Intoduced it to my wife, who usually likes word games, and she seems to like it well in the two-player form. I'd give it a 10 if you were allowed to derail other players trains.  Update 03/08: Past couple of plays have driven me to anger at the competition, but it's still great game!

This is a great game and easy to learn the basics for.  I originally rated it an 8, but bumped it up to a 9 because with a little modification it also becomes an excellent game to play with my 5-year-old that helps with counting and color/pattern matching; plus the added bonus that he loves trains.

I dont really enjoy this game, and it wouldnt be my first choice to play. While i like the minor tension it creates, i don't feel there is really much strategy or interaction and thus it's not really on the top of my MUST own titles.
I can see how this maybe a good introduction for people how haven't played any boardgames outside the classic hasbro titles, but from a gamers perspective this is mindless.

also worth noting that my group is 5 people...and i would imagine this game is better suited for less people

RATING: 8
Components: The production is quite good: very attractive, functional, and durable components. I've upgraded to the 1910 cards; wish I had the 2nd edition score track.

Experience: Very tense, from the first turns stockpiling cards, to the very end, when the threat of the final round looms over any incomplete tickets. I'm enjoying a new layer of choice-making as I'm becoming familiar with the tickets, how difficult they are to fulfill, and how they can work together.

Still one of the best gateway games, this classicly simple mechanics and brilliant strategy keeps it coming out time and time again.

Ticket to Ride games should still be in the gaming stores hundreds of years from now. TTR has a clean, elegant design with tension despite the lack of direct player interaction. It looks good and has a great deal of stand alone expansions with limitless potential (you have a map? TTR could make a game out of it). This game should be held in the same regards as the "best" mass-market games such as Monopoly or Clue. Highest possible recommendation.

RATING: 9
I had played a couple of Euro-style games before my first game of Ticket to Ride, but this was the game that really set me down the path of the Serious Boardgamer (TM). 

First, the bad: I now mostly play the game online, where it is substantially faster than in real life. In person, I find things move pretty slowly, especially when playing with less experienced players. Sometimes you have lots of three-wild boards and need to shuffle the deck a bunch, which means even more sitting around waiting for things to happen. Sometimes people will stare at the board wondering what to do for a bit too long, and you don't want to push them along because it's a pretty casual and newbie-friendly game, but come...on...already...

In terms of actual mechanical lackings, the most readily apparent one is the randomness of the opening ticket draw. You will sometimes get three terrible routes that go North-South along short routes that eat up valuable resources, and then you will sometimes get Los Angeles-New York and Los Angeles-Miami or some other busted start and have to actively work to lose the game. It's not fun knowing that you've got so much riding (no pun intended) on something that happens at the beginning of a potentially hourlong game. Obviously a skilled player can overcome this (and I'm far from a high-skilled player), but it's still frustrating. I don't know how to improve it, though.

On the other hand, this game is just very fun for something so simple and so easy to teach. You can take someone with no gaming experience beyond Monopoly and have them putting up a fight in TtR within five minutes of the board hitting the table. There's a sort of push-your-luck element where you grip your cards hoping that nobody else takes that valuable 6 car route before you can get it without using your wilds, but unless you have exceptionally bad luck off the top of the deck you will rarely be completely out of the game. The theme is obviously well-implemented, if a bit straightforward (you're not gonna see 18xx mechanics here, and that's fine), and I love trying to make a really cool route or a really powerful route with lots of long journeys.

Ultimately, the game rewards longtime players and still offers plenty for a beginner. It's by no means perfect, but it's an excellent gateway that still held up for me even as I moved to heavier games.

RATING: 5
Basically just a race to see who can draw the right cards and build their routes first.  Not much player interaction, and what little strategy there is comes from choosing routes that are coordinated (not too hard) and knowing whether to draw another route card toward the end of the game.

"3 minutes to learn how to play"...13 minutes to boredom.
quote from a geeklist :
"The merit of good light games is they have some sort of dynamic fun factor. I don't consider draw-draw-draw-draw-draw-draw- play route -draw-draw-draw- play route (screw someone blindly)- draw-draw-draw-draw-draw-draw-draw-draw- play route - to be a very fun gaming experience."

This is one that everyone I've taught it to likes.  It doesn't play the same as Union Pacific, but for me it's what I wanted UP to be.  You actually use the map in this game; UP has always bummed me out because even though there are restrictions as to what can be placed where on the map it is extremely difficult to use physical position to block anyone.  I love the jockeying to connect your target cities and block your opponents' connections.  I also love the risk/reward tradeoff of the connections...

This was the game for us.  The kids love it, it's quick, easy, strategic. much deeper than it appears to start with, looks great.  Can't say enough good things about it.  We got the 1910 expansion - worth it for the bigger cards alone, but also adds variety if the original tickets become too predictable.  Have played Europe but didn't like it as much - the one long ticket each mechanism makes it too easy to see what people are up to, and a bit formulaic.  Saying that, there's still something not quite right with the luck of the intial deal and it would be nice to figure out a way to balance this in the game.  There's an interesting card passing initial deal variant, which we should probably try.

RATING: 7
Really, this game is a glorified version of gin and it's ilk (gin rummy, rummy, etc.), but with a nice theme, and a little extra strategy involved. There's definitely a learning curve, but a fairly quick one, and not too steep, but just enough surprising subtlety to make the games interesting. It can play a little slow, and it's not my preferred kind of game, but as it's accessible for anyone ages 6 or 7 and up, it's easier than most to get people to play. In fact, most of my games have been with people who otherwise wouldn't even look at a board game.

A strange thing has happened to me with TTR.  I have come to enjoy it considerably more than when I first played it.  It's getting better with age.

Original Comments:
For so long, I couldn't figure out why this was such a big hit.  I finally acquired it and I'm still not sure why, but I definitely don't mind playing it :o).  I actually enjoy it, but there's not much depth here.  It's just so approachable, though our games are always tense.  I sweat more playing this game more than I sweat or have sweated playing any other game before.

It's certainly not an ugly game.

Turning out to be a great game because of it's flexibility and super ascesible nature.

My 7 yo actually plays this with me and he played with my wife as well and even though he didn't win, he still enjoyed it and wants to play again!

Not my personal favorite... Then again, anything that I can get people to the table with me is my favorite and so far this one is notching the sessions.

This game would be a lot more fun if you had to start in one city and arrive at another before the end of the game, circumventing various obstacles and other players along the way. Instead, despite the theme of a turn of the century "Around the World in 80 Days" re-enactment you can, in fact, grab any route on the board you have the cards for at any time. Scoring has been rigged to encourage you to try to connect up everything by the end of the game but it plays like an afterthought... actually, at best, it plays like you're *flying* from one city to the next, then taking short train trips. In the end the game is fun enough, but with a little extra attention to theme this game could have been so much better. Addendum: And what's the deal with all the card accumulating at the start? The more I play the less this appeals to me...

A game we use frequently to introduce people to the hobby. Accomplished players can get through the game fairly quickly and it is fun to play on the USA map. I much prefer the Nordic Countries map as it has more strategic decisions. This game is fun and light.

Is about railway routes between cities across the USA. These are pre-printed on the map. You claim them by playing a set of cards and putting plastic train pieces in your colour on the board along the route. So, each turn has a basic decision. Do you pick up more cards or put some down to claim a route? That's not too difficult, so turns tend to move pretty quickly. Usually you get several turns of players picking up cards and eyeing each other. Then someone cracks and claims a route. A flurry of card playing follows as players claim routes they need – or just have the cards for.

Ticket to Ride is a tremendous game. It is extremely engaging and fun to play. Players must carefully balance their needs to claim routes early as well as to collect the right cards to finish the job. Players can choose to rely on luck more (get cards from the deck, draw risky tickets) or to play it safer (only take face up cards and build long routes rather than risk taking more tickets). Both ways can easily win as the tempo of the game is determined very much by the players. There are many expansion maps available which make sure that this one will not get old, although I would probably be happy even with just the basic USA map.

Easy to pick up and fun with a small-medium group. Even people who do not tend to enjoy board games will enjoy this one. The art and pieces are great and the box is wonderful. No baggies or bowls needed. Takes minutes to set up and clean up and games can go by rather quickly.

Probably one of the most overrated games I have seen yet.

You draw cards to cover train routes.  Different cards have different colors, and so do the routes.  The bigger the route you take, the more points you receive.  In addition, semi-random "tickets" can be chosen that give you a bonus for finishing the route or a decrement if you do not cover the route.

The good thing about this game is that it is easy to learn.  Most people (including a 6 year old) figured it out in 3 minutes and could play it.

So why is this game a fail?  It's entire design revolves around card counting, deck memorization, and knowing the shape of the map.  You had better keep track of how many red cards (and blue, purple, white, etc) have been played or you will never know what % chance you have of finishing one route over another (quickly that is).  Knowing what cards are left in the "tickets" deck is crucial.  Drawing another ticket can win or lose a game for you, if you know that it is highly unlikely that anything left is going to help you, you had better skip pulling another card.  And finally, knowing which sides of the map are easy or hard depending on your ticket selection is crucial.  

Basically that means you need to memorize a lot.  The person who owns it will probably destroy everyone else.  That doesn't lead to many replays in some groups.

I enjoyed this a lot more than Europe. The lack of stations gave it a bit more tension, as I genuinely worried at times that other players may 'steal my routes'.

Of course, if that threat had become reality, I may have hated it...

Rules are simple to teach and it works as a gateway game, yet there's a good few choices to make. Choosing cards to take, a route to claim or pushing your luck with more tickets - these 3 possible moves each involve their own set of choices and whilst it never gets particularly heavy, there is potential for trying out varying strategies.

Pushing your luck by getting more routes is probably the most interesting part of the game, as well as the potential screwage.

People may not ride the train anymore. But lots of people still play this game series. It's familiar, casual, peaceful, and classic ride. Everyone has some idea of what to expect. But new games in the series are still finding slight innovations to improve the formula or alter it in fun and novel ways. Some of them are fairly relaxing. Some of them are very cutthroat and nasty. There's room for strategy in all of them despite it being an entry-level game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Beautiful components. New players enjoy the setup and play of this game a lot, making it a great intro game. After playing a number of times, I find it lacks much "Take That". There also appears to be a winning strategy of connecting long paths between cities. 
I would perhaps recommend TTR Europe even to new Euro collectors above TTR as it appears to have a bit more strategy, though I haven't played it myself. 
UPDATE: 7.0 I cant help it but I must raise the rating. New players are all over this game, and it is pretty satisfying to tell them - "look just make sure you get your tickets done", then on the second turn slap down a three route like its the end of the world and see the pressure  hit the roof on thier faces. I mean it doesn't even have to be near their routes! The moment they feel that tension they are hooked, and its pretty fun to be the one to get the kettle boiling. 3-4 players only please. 
After all that Im still on the fence about getting the expansion. Is this the new Monopoly? sigh.

Great, great lighter game.  Everyone wants to know where they can buy it.  There's a little too much downtime between turns with my group, people get distracted and lose track of whose turn it is, and the cards are a little smaller than I'd really like, but we can't seem to stop playing it anyway....VERY addictive :)

Not deep, but still a fun game now and then. Makes a great family game since it's easy to teach and fairly fast. I think the 1910 expansion improves the game quite a bit--partly just the bigger cards, but also the larger set of routes makes it harder to cut someone off. 

I own the deluxe edition and so traded away my base set.

A great game to play with family, and one of the best gateway games ever--possibly the easiest good boardgame to teach to others.

I like it.  I predicted it's win SdJ after I played it once, 'cuz it's got the same universal appeal of Settlers and Carcassonne.  Many people have compared this game to Union Pacific and TransAmerica.  Frankly, other than American trains (and then only weakly), I don't see much of a relationship.  If you wanted to compare it to Santa Fe, then maybe...   All comparisons aside, Mr. Moon has a real cross-over winner here!

RATING: 6
I've got to admit, that although I was skeptical, I actually enjoyed this game.  Could be because I won in my first game (against 3 other players)!  But, after playing Thurn & Taxis, I didn't think TTR would be as entertaining.  

Well, it isn't quite as fun, but it was still pretty good.  The game offers enough options to keep it from being completely out of the players' control.  And, being a light game, it doesn't drag on too long.  The hidden VPs in the route cards really make it a good game, rather than a decent one.

Like other light, gateway games, this one will be fun to play once in a while.  Being the gamer that I am, I will want to play meatier games more often.

I don't get the love for this game. It's basically draw 2 cards, draw 2 cards, draw 2 cards, draw 2 cards, play a train. Rinse and repeat. I've played it with different player counts and the game is just not that tight. Trying to block your opponents usually only hinders you unless you just happen to need to go that way as well. I hear the other versions are better in this regard but for me the base game is just purely for newer gamers and kids.

I'll keep it around simply because I think my kids will enjoy it.

RATING: 7.5
I do like this game quite a bit - it's easy to teach and quick to learn for new players. The initial issue I have had with the game after about 10 plays or so is that the luck of the initial draw determines a good portion of the scoring. If a player is able to get two of the los angeles/san francisco to new york/atlanta routes at the beginning of the game, they can easily dominate someone who gets all mid-count tickets [ie. 4's through 9's].

I enjoy playing this game, but if you play with people who are offended by you blocking their path, it's probably best not to play it with them. If you place "nice", it's basically a solitaire exercise in building the best tracks.

RATING: 6.5
Rated after a bunch of plays with all types of player counts.

It's just an ok game. I love the network building aspect of the game but it's pretty one dimensional and luck driven. So many games can be decided based on what cards come up and in what order. I'd play again with groups of gamers that enjoy lighter games or if someone really wants to play it. If I have a group open to deeper games and we want a network building game, I'm going to recommend Steam, Age of Steam of 18xx.

There are so many reviews of Ticket to Ride out there that I can't really offer anything new to say. This is an ideal gateway game with easy to understand and intuitive rules.

I've played this three times now and after not liking it initially due to lack of conflict, it is now growing on me.  I find it better with a group of 5, which makes the board a bit more cramped and means people are more desperate to complete their routes before somebody else does.

I don't know what some people see in this beyond an average family game. I accept it might be a 5.5 as a family game, but my ratings here mostly cover my "hobby player" needs.
To me TtR looks somewhat fun to start, but becomes boring during play quickly as IMHO all you do is securing a few tracks just if player count/map/jobs require it, and otherwise accumulate cards and find the right timing not to be too late to blow all of them resources.
(This admittedly is after only ca. 6 games, US map plus one Europe I think, the feeling did not change much after the first 2 games.)

This game causes me so much anxiety. Especially with five players, it gets crowded and you feel like everyone is out to get you. Takes a couple plays before figuring out the many different strategies there are. Hint: get a couple of those 6 long segments even if it doesn't fit your tickets. Possession of those can get you very far on the scoreboard.

There's something lacking (for me) in this game. It's too quick and there's just too much chance based on route cards.

Basically, you draw cards and lay tracks.  You can't foil anyone as there are virtually a million paths to every destination.  So then it comes down to drawing cards and placing trains.  This has to be the most over-hyped game ever.  

If you are looking for a game where you drink beer and occasionally pay attention to what's going on, this is it.


I once saw a guy draw a circle on his white board then toss small sticky balls (about an inch is size) at it for hours.  I thought he would grow tired of this painfully dull act after a day or so.  A year later he still does it as he finds it most relaxing and fun.  I realized that this is how some people meditate (whether they know it or not).  They focus on the easy task at hand and clear the mind.  The easier the task, the more euphoria the brain experiences.  This game is popular because satisfies the same requirement.  A very simple, zero strategy game that sends the brain in to an easy mediative state.  This euphoria elevates when the brain discovers that it could complete a route and did not have to work - thus fulfilling one the the laws of physics that states everything seeks is lowest energy level.  

For that, I give it a 10.  But for gaming, I give it a 1.  I have played this 11 or 12 times now.  After the first 4 (trying to find something I may have been missing) I mostly observed the other players - a very interesting experiment (try it sometime!).  They had the same happy look on their faces as the guy with the sticky balls.  Don't think me negative, I too now like the sticky balls (heh heh).  But for this type of game, I prefer Risk or Monopoly - a tad more excitement with the dice.

TTR is a great gateway or middle ground game that anyone can play.  The game mechanics work perfectly and make for some tense moments as you hope to not get cut off by your opponents.  Easy enough to teach to kids and non-gamers, although the heavy amount of luck could be a turn off to those who like more brain burning games.  Nastier players can go on an all out defensive by simply cutting off all the important routes.  Once you complete your routes you can take new route cards.  This is a dangerous lottery as you will usually get either easy points, or instantly get stuck with impossible routes that will end your would-be victory.  All in all though, a good game.

Game is great at first, but scales poorly with additional plays.

I can't see this leaving my Top 10 anytime soon. This is a superb example of a great game with simple goals, yet great strategic gameplay. It has a sleek design, great components, is accessible to many who are unfamiliar with more complex games, yet provides good depth.

RATING: 8
I enjoy the unique play mechanic of having to save up the right number of cards to claim a route and the tension that comes with trying to save up cards so you don't have to use wilds, and get a route before someone else does.  If someone takes the route between the last two cities you needed, it can be quite a challenge to snake around a different way!

RATING: 7
It's entertaining, quick, and easy to explain.  This is a great game to introduce to fledgling players.  You know what?  I like it too.  
I prefer the base game (with the 1910 addition) to Marklin and Europe.  Marklin might be the best game of the series, but for what it adds, I find I'd rather play something else.  When it comes to simple, TtR can't be beat in my book.

Doel van het spel:

Wanneer een speler aan het einde van zijn beurt nog 2 ,1 of  0 treinwagons in zijn voorraad heeft, dan begint de laatste ronde. Iedere speler is nog 1 keer aan de beurt (inclusief de speler die het spel beëindigde). De spelers berekenen hun eindscore en de speler met de meeste punten wint het spel. In geval van gelijkstand, wint de speler met de meeste bestemmingskaarten. 

Voorbereiding:

+ Iedere speler kiest een kleur en neemt zijn 45 treinwagons en een scoresteen (op veld “1” van het scorespoor). 
+ Schud de treinwagonkaarten en geef iedere speler 4 kaarten. Leg 5 kaarten open en de overige kaarten vormen een gedekte trekstapel. 
+ Iedere speler krijgt 3 bestemmingskaarten waarvan hij er minstens 2 moet houden. 
+ Kies een startspeler. 

Speelverloop:

Het spel wordt met de wijzers van de klok gespeeld. De speler aan de beurt kan slechts één van de 3 beschikbare acties uitvoeren: 

1/ Treinwagonkaarten nemen 

De actieve speler kan 2 open en/of gedekte treinwagonkaarten nemen. Bij het trekken van een open kaart, moet de speler direct een nieuwe kaart uit de gedekte stapel neerleggen. Pas daarna kan hij een tweede kaart nemen (geen locomotief van de open stapel). 
Wanneer de speler een open locomotiefkaart neemt dan mag hij geen tweede kaart meer nemen. 

2/ Een route claimen 

De speler claimt een route tussen twee steden door exact het aantal treinwagonkaarten (met de kleur van de route) uit te spelen. Hij plaatst een treinwagon op ieder vakje van de route. De speler is steeds verplicht om de volledige route te claimen. Hij kan iedere, open route op de kaart claimen (hij moet geen verbinding maken met eerder gelegde routes). Na het bouwen van een route ontvangt hij direct punten:

Lengte van de route – punten:

1 – 1
2 – 2
3 – 4
4 – 7
5 – 10
6 – 15

Alle kaarten die nodig waren om de route te bouwen worden afgelegd. 

3/ Bestemmingskaarten nemen 

De speler trekt 3 bestemmingskaarten waarvan hij er minstens 1 moet houden. De niet-gekozen kaarten legt hij af.

Eindscore = huidige score van de gemaakte verbindingen + punten van de voltooide bestemmingskaarten + 10 punten voor de speler met de langste aaneengesloten route – punten van alle onvoltooide bestemmingskaarten.

Belangrijke regels:

+ Bij 2 à 3 spelers kan slechts één dubbele route gebruikt worden. 
+ Een locomotief telt als een joker en kan een treinwagonkaart vervangen in het bouwen aan een route. 
+ Grijze routes = de speler bouwt met een kleur naar keuze. 
+ Een speler kan niet beide routes van een “dubbele routeverbinding” claimen. 
+ Liggen er 3 locomotiefkaarten in de open trekstapel, dan wordt de trekstapel afgelegd en 5 nieuwe kaarten getrokken.

What I liked
* Easy to teach and play
* Appeals to gamers and non gamers
* Thought the theme would be dry, but enjoyed it
* Plays fast, little downtime
* The map just feels less interesting than the Europe map.
* Pieces come baged and with spare carrages!

What I didn't like
* Need to make sure the deck is VERY shuffled before starting each game.
* Game is all about efficiency, unfortunately luck plays a fairly big part in how efficiant you can be.

If experienced players are playing against beginners, they really should give some helpful advice about what to go for and strategy before the game starts otherwise there is a very big advantage to the experienced player.

* Some of the printing on the cards on my copy was dodgy

I understand the appeal, I just never feel like I'm playing an interactive game. Seems like multiplayer solitaire, with any sabotage occurring purely by chance. Choosing to interact can almost be detrimental in revealing shared route priority, and choosing to sabotage an opponent is so costly that it only guarantees both of you lose.

RATING: 6
The appeal of this game is tension.  Anxiety both in the draft and laying track.  DOWNGRADE.  DOWNGRADE.  The double reward for east/west tickets is fatally flawed: large point values and long (5 and 6 train) high scoring sections.  For example, New York-Seattle is easy and far too valuable.  UPDATE.  Much much better (Rating 9) with 1910 expansion!  UPGRADE.

Moving it up the rankings as I've come to believe that it's the best "Gateway Game" out there, and not a bad two-player game either, especially on some of the smaller expansion maps like the U.K.

[August 2014 - 7.4]
It's quickly growing to be a mainstream classic, and a good one to get into gaming. Easy to teach, learn and pick-up on your first game. The rating I give it is my own personal preference/willingness to play and probably deserves to be higher. As a beginner game, it's more like a '9'.

Fun game and there can be a bit of strategy with blocking. But frankly IMHO it all comes down to whether or not your route cards have lots of common segments.

The 1910 expansion is almost a requirement to replace the tiny cards with larger ones and add lots more routes.

Any game that gets my wife to do that is OK in my book!  Actually, I liked it quite a lot myself.  We played with the 1910 expansion, so that got purchased too.  We always liked Empire Builder, and this is much better.  And, trains are way cool!  
I can see why this is rated as one of the best "gateway" games ever.  But it is definitely more than that, as well.
Rated lower than the USA 1910 expansion due solely to the small card size.

This is my new favorite game to lure non-gamers into the wonderful world of Euro games.  It is simpler than Settlers and still has enough going on to occupy my mind while playing.  This is an unbelievably great game and I recommend it to all families, gamers, and non-gamers alike.  It would have been rated higher if the cards had a better balance in their points.  For some reason, the highest points are given for the routes that go across the country East West and these routes already give great bonuses for the 6 track routes that have to get used.  It is a pity that the cards were not balanced better...

I had no idea that I would like Ticket to Ride as much as I do.  The story is incredibly stupid, and I do not care much for trains, but I love the game.

Ticket to Ride was fine as far as shorter games go. But, like Alhambra, it seemed to bet not quite interesting enough to play over other other, better games. I am sure that if I played it another half dozen times I could gain some joy out of the experience of exploring the game, but I would quickly grow bored with it after that. It just seemed that there was not enough "game" there for it to be worth spending time or money on it. 

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Players either draft rail car cards, play melds of these cards to connect cities together (and score points), or draw ticket cards (hidden agenda points).  Most points wins.   So simple, anybody could have invented it.  It's a fun meld/connection game, looks wonderful, but once you get past that, the game leaves you with a huge "is that it?" factor.  Sits between ultra-fluffy TransAmerica and more meaty Santa Fe Rails.  Looks like it's aimed at families, and I can see it being a strong SdJ contender.

Wow, for such a simple game, it creates a surprisingly exciting atmosphere. Every decision in the game is tense because of the anticipation of what might happen before your next turn. My wife does not like this game anymore because it stresses her out. It's not a game I can play over and over, but it's one that will never lose its appeal to me. Our house rule is that all your trains have to be gone before the game ends. It lengthens the game slightly, but I think it requires better planning. 

On a side note, I recently played a game where one card (or the lack thereof) made a difference of -166 points in my score. I had bet it all on the big routes and came up short.

The US version is just a little too harsh for my taste. You can win or lose depending on the luck of the ticket draw, by getting cut off in the wrong place & time, or by the game ending a turn early. I invariably end up chewing my fingernails to a nub every time we play. Ties for Marklin as my least favorite TTR

like this game a lot, easy to teach and play, and has a couple of different winning stategies.  Just got the expansion for this, and it adds a lot to the game.

This generation's Monopoly.

1. Card / Set Collecting - Check.
2. Competition on getting limited resources (Properties vs. Routes) - Check.
3. Luck Element (Dice Rolling vs. Card Drawing) - Check
4. Limited supply of components to utilize the resources (Train miniatures vs. House / Hotels) - Check
5. Low Learning Curve - Check

Ticket to Ride has a better process to end the game vs. Monopoly. The worst case with Monopoly is when nobody owns a Monopoly AND the players refuse to negotiate. The game goes on an on with people paying anywhere from $ 2 to $ 50 rentals. The only way to mitigate this is via time limit, but if time limit was not set this lends to a long and boring game. Ticket to Ride addresses this by having either the board filled out or the depletion of train supply by any player.

A great learning game that dies once you discover better games.  The problem is that the game doesn't offer a lot of intentional interaction, doesn't punish horading, and really is just waiting for the right color cards to come out for a very predictable and bland path.

RATING: 10
Most people agree this is a good game especially for non-gamers.  I'd say slightly better than Carcassonne.  So just from that I'd give it a 7.5.  The reason its a 10 is that playing 2 player is highly skill intensive.  If you don't believe me, meet me at the Days of Wonder site and I'll play you online and will probably beat you 90% of the time.  If you are good than maybe only 75%, but either way if you play a decent number of games (which go really fast online), the more skilled player will come out on top. [After playing 5,000+ games online, and being one of the top 20 or so players in the world, I don't think I would really enjoy the game face to face unless I was just introducing it to new people]

I didn't really get it the first few plays. This grew on me with repeated plays, however. Now I consider it a strong game, short enough to play other games on the night, but satisfying enough on it's own.
There is an interesting pressure dynamic between taking train cards (gathering resources) and laying track (turning them into points).

However, it's a good game, solid rules, easy to teach, goes over well with people (except my one hardcore train friend, who was PISSED it was trainy enough). There's so many damn variations on it where all that really changes is the map, just get whatever map you like the most, I'm Swedish so I have the Nordic countries one.

I do not like this game so much, it is too plain for me, but I've raised my rating after several games with very different people and noticed that almost everybody likes it. For example, my parents have probably played it more than one hundred times and still love it. It is their "afternoon game". 

And that is what it makes this game so interesting for me: a family game that can be fun for expert gamers as well, from little kids to adults, that can be played casually or competitively. I have to admit it is a great idea.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Without a doubt, THE definitive gateway game to modern boardgames for non-gamers.  This was really the first Euro-game that got me into Euro Games.  Prior to this I played Chess a lot as a kid, and played the old Milton Bradley “GameMaster” series games “Axis & Allies” and “Conquest of the Empire” along with “Risk” and “Diplomacy”.  In fact it was at a Diplomacy meet that I played Ticket to Ride for the first time.  We had finished a five hour game and one participant pointed out this game to us and recommend we give it a try.  None of us had really played anything outside our usual strategy war games before.  I had played “Settlers of Catan” before, but that game never really grabbed me.  After we finished Ticket to Ride we all looked at each other wide-eyed like we had just found the map to El Dorado.  I myself could never go back to playing those old strategy war games again and began my journey into Eurogame land.  Fast forward many many years later and I STILL enjoy playing the original Ticket to Ride (although you really do need the 1910 expansion).  
I’ve introduced so many people to modern boardgaming through this game and it always go over so well with non-gamers.  Although the game is something of a litmus test as I can count three instances where this game showed that some people really can’t handle anything beyond Sorry, Uno and Monopoly.  
I think the reason this game makes a better gateway game than Settler of Catan is that the tickets give players some very SPECIFIC goals that they can zero-in and focus on.  With very simple streamlined rules (for about 99% of the human population) and a set of starting individual goals that players can zero-in on, players can really get a hold of game after just a few rounds.  Yet there is strategy required here and players are focusing on multiple objectives and stay intrigued with gameplay even when its not their turn, breathlessly hopping no one blocks their route before they can play their hand.  
One thing you really do need to hammer in with new players is that there is no correlation between the color of your trains and the color of your routes/cards.  I’m not sure why, but it can be troubling for some people; for example, they want to claim a route that needs five green cards but then look at their (red) train supply and say, “oh, I can’t do that, I only have red trains” even though I’ve gone over the rules several times (and even laid down some routes myself).  They then realize that and say, “Oh, that’s right, I knew that!” but honestly, its just something they can’t get past mentally and I’ve seen it happen a few times while teaching the game.  Although once they are able to get past that, its bye bye to Sorry, Uno and Monopoly.  
Overall, Ticket to Ride is THE PERFECT GAME.

RATING: 6
Ticket to ride by itself is somewhat weak.  The cards are mini size which is too small, and the limited number of routes make it unbalanced when playing veteran and new players in the same game.  However, simply adding the 1910 expansion vastly improves the game, amking it an often played enjoyable experience.

-limited links between cities
-must pay to create longer links
-bigger and bigger rewards for successfully completing larger links

Not only that - it plays very quickly - a lot of fun in a nice tidy little package.

A really nice game. The art and the concept are great. 

Ticket to Ride is really easy to play and to learn. The goal is to connect all the routes you have, to score more points than the other players. The routes are kept in secret, and only at the end of the game are revealed to score (+) or (-) points depending if you did the connection between the two places of the route or not. 

There are 3 options to do, but only 1 per turn. You can go for train tickets (the trains are colored), claim a route (discarding many train tickets according to the route path) and draw extra route tickets (to try to make more routes).

Who knew building train tracks would be fun? In this game you have to build tracks around the US and secure the routes that you draw on your cards. Its really fun to try to build your routes, and once you get 4 players involved the competition factor really ramps up because you will all be going for those middle spots. Not much coop factor here unfortunately, but still makes a fun family game with no too much fighting or rule book checking.

Non gamer game. Anybody can play. Can be an excellent game to start non-gamers into gamers. Very light and simple.

I prefer Transamerica compared to Ticket to Ride. There is down time between turns. Draw a card or play cards. Nothing else to think about.

Beautiful game and bits. What city cards you get at the start of the game says where is best to start. I prefer having not having my choices that limited. The replay value is there.

Solitaire game with little interaction. Boring, no tension. Hand mangement. Some strategies, but luck also a factor. Some chaos too. A bit boring for my taste.

Maybe something to get my brother as a gift.

What's not to like about Ticket to Ride?

Ticket to ride is a good step between Monopoly and real boardgames. However, it's kinda boring and uninteresting for gamers. Definitively not a game for me.

Poor.  Bland, stale, little tension or excitement.  No connection to the theme -- and why is it about traveling around the US instead of monopolizing route like a true rail baron?  Extremely tedious gameplay.

Spiel des Jahres 2004. The best of all the TTR games because of it's simplicity and quickness.  Sure, it's just set collecting, but, it is a gateway game that is still enjoyable the 10th time you play it. The set collecting also creates an artifical sense of racing with the other players, which can make for tense turns in the mid-late game.

RATING: 6
Played two player a couple of times.  Interesting concept, but I had two problems with it.  The main problem is the insane amount of card shuffling necessary to start the game and/or reshuffle the discard deck.  Since you play cards in sets of the same color, if you don't shuffle 10+ times, you will see these same sets show up again.  I can't count how many times we had the same card color show up four draws in a row.

The other problem was that there wasn't really any competition to get the tracks; I laid the ones to get my destination, and the other guy laid the ones to get his--there didn't seem to be much overlap in what we wanted.  This could easily be a problem with the two player game that doesn't show up with more players.

I could see this being a good game with more players and therefore more competition, but as a two player game, it's just ok.

I don't really get the hype around this game. Sure it's an ok game, but for me it feels to be lacking in interactivity.

There isn't a great deal of player-to-player interaction, which could be added with some sort of barter system.  Maybe this game doesn't need it.

Unfortunately, I think it's a good enough game, but I just can't bear to play it.  A little too long, I think.  You know, after about 30 minutes, I'm tired of my three choices - draw cards, tickets, or play.  Let's move on.

Ah the first train game I played and still one I love.  I would almost consider this game a filler, but longer.  If my group is in a more social, chatty mood and eating snacks, I see this as a great choice.

I've mostly played the Marklin version and my gripe with it is that it is hard for new players to utilize the passengers. The original TTR is an easier game to pick up and play and the thrill of making your cross continent routes work is a fun ride while it lasts, although it is just so simple. I give the highest rating to the Europe version.

45-60m, best with 3-4 players. 5+ plays.

Not bad, not bad at all, though with cavets.  It definitely feels like a gateway game, which is great, but it isn't something that I'll just come back to over and over again.  Also, I find that the game plays too long (face to face) for what it is doing.  Not soul sucking, but when you play it online and zip through a game it feels much better in terms of the elegant design.

UPDATE: I can't remember the last time I've played this game or seen anyone in our game group play this. I keep it on the shelf mostly out of habit these days.

UPDATE: This game is starting to wear a little thin for me -- my desire to play this game again is becoming less and less but it's been a good run.

This has now replaced Transamerica as our "bring new gamers into the fold" game. Unlike Transamerica and other "non-gamer" games though, it's a good game in its own right. My only quibble with the game is the randomness of the routes -- you can know before the first turn if you're hosed.

It's a good "gateway game" with easy-to-learn mechanics and light strategy. The downside is that after you've played it 10 - 15 times, you easily have many of the routes memorized. The game is still fun; but there's less mystery that way, and sabotaging your opponent is easier. (There is an expansion which may remedy this somewhat.)

RATING: 4
This game is good as a gateway game, but I think Ticket to Ride Europe is a much better game overall.  My friends and I started with Europe and didn't have any troubles with complexity, though the original is probably a better gateway with non-gamers.  The biggest issue I have with game is that this game should have included what the 1910 expansion added to the game, particularly the larger sized cards.

This game "works", but is not "good" or "fun". To me it's a kid's game (nothing wrong with that). There are much better "Gateway" games out there. The Europe implementation is the best way to play.

Many great games. Quick to learn, difficult to master, has people engaged from the get go. This is my joint favourite of the 'gateway games' (alongside Dominion), and the one I've had most success with. I do give a little advice at the start about building up cards and aiming for longer routes.
Playing with people who love strategy is even better, as it can get very cutthroat. Downside is, there will be some games with little interaction (if say you're both completing tickets in very different areas). But even this is fun.

Too much luck (of what you get and what others get) for me, but a nice simple game. Good for kids.

Playing it again I find there is a little skill in where you decide to place routes, but the main item I saw in our recent game, was if you end up getting similar maps to other people, you just cause trouble to each other. While other people can get maps where no one else is near and be able to put down routes without issue?

This is a great game for several reasons. First, the mechanics are simple and it's easy to learn. Second, it moves along at a very good pace. Third, the excitement is there because at multiple points in the game you are forced to make critical decisions that could make or break you. Will another player take that critical route before I am able to get it? Should I gamble and take more tickets? It's just a lot of fun and easy enough that you can probably play with your kids. My 10 year-old has no problem handling this game.

A great family game, with little to intrigue veteran gamers. Although the base game is very run-of-the-mill, the addition of ferries, tunnels, and stations in the Europe edition are quite fun. However, I find myself revisiting the same strategies time-and-time again. Experienced players claim that blocking routes is important, but I've never found blocking to be an effective point mechanism, or strategy deterrent.

Ticket to Ride... a fun family themed game. Great to play; however, I think I like the Europe or Marklin versions better!
05/26/2009: Played today with gaming group from work. It was a great game; however, I did not realize that some of the train cards were missing. It was that we began the game with a really small deck to start with with. We cycled thru the cards at a quick pace. doh! 
05/27/2009: Played at lunch with FNL. Great time. We were done in less than 30 minutes. Time for San Juan!

The backstory connection to the game is weak; the game feels more like you're building track than traveling around the country.  This is a game about set collection, where you use the sets to claim routes between cities.  Simple and accessible.  Plays quickly, with little downtime between turns.  There's tension in the game: do you continue to collect cards, or claim a route before you're blocked?

Started at a high rating, was a fun game. Downgraded over several game sessions where I concluded that... I really hate this game. It started as my "bring to non-gamers get togethers" game, but I feel it's time consuming, and ultimately doesn't do as well in 4-5 person groups as other games. When played with serious gamers, it does become very deep. Play times are much faster with an experienced group - but it still usually gets passed up for Carcassonne or 7 Wonders.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Nice, light, and easy to teach. This simplicity is both a blessing and a curse. The game is too simple for my tastes to really be great, and the tickets can be an unfortunate source of being screwed by luck since some of the tickets are unbalanced with destinations in the West being generally better than the East.

Never intro'd anyone to TTR who doesn't enjoy it right away. It's always fun to play, even with very experienced players. Newbies won't feel so left behind, aside from the fact that they won't be familiar with the routes.

I also pick this game when playing with difficult players - not much interaction means everyone can play out their own strategies, while having a chance to block without killing each other's chance of winning. 

I highly recommend this game for anyone and everyone above 8 yo.

A nice, light-weight game. I was initially apprehensive about the train theme, but it really works well. The components are really good quality. The game is luck-based, but I think it usually averages out by the end of the game. With some people, the game be pretty cutthroat.

I don't like this game much with 2 people, 4+ seems right to me.

Prefer Europe over USA version.  The US version has all long and short routes mixed in so it was lots of luck which routes you get.  Where as the Europe version everyone has to take a long route.

The game is less forgiving without stations (making it harder) but there are no tunnels (making it easier).

Fun and unique game that can be easily taught and get into for just about anyone.  What settlers did in the 90s, this did in the 2000s which is bring new gamers to heavier euro strategy games.  My only gripe is the game can come down to what destinations you draw late in the game, i.e. if you draw cards you have basically already completed.  A small gripe though.  I'd play this pretty much whenever.

(As of [b]2[/b] plays) Regarded as one of the "must-have" gateway games, as there is enough potential for player conflict to keep it entertaining without becoming too openly cutthroat.

I can't say my heart leaps up at the prospect of playing it, but the fact that it has made my relatives interested in gaming is positively priceless.

Perfect gateway game.  

The game is easily explained in 5 minutes, and strategy is mostly intuitive.  It starts off with an open board and people typically cooperate.  However, it can quickly become more cutthroat as those spots start to fill in, and people are taking the cards you want.  But it never gets completely hopeless, which means everyone stays engaged the whole time.

Love this game.  If I'm just playing with family or newbies, the US map is just so much easier to explain (and the other players are just usually so much less whiny about not being able to find a location).  The US map is more unforgiving though due to several lynch pins in the map and in general I like the Europe version a bit better for friendly play (less chance to really screw someone out of completing routes), also, I like the tunnel and ferry routes.  Used to rate this lower back when you needed to buy the expansion to get full sized cards (apparently the newer versions of this game have corrected this faux pas).

German "Game of the year" is and was for my a price for a "family game", ...but sometimes the Jury was really strange with there decisions... (not to say simply stupid!)

Easy to learn, also for non-gamers, or new gamers you want to introduce in board gaming. Simple rules, good ruleset and nice components. (You should buy the "bigger" cards from the "Europe 1912" set, not necessary but better to handle.)

Truly one of the greatest games ever produced. I still remember my feeling of wonder the first time I played it; I felt like I had finally found something I had lost but had forgotten I even lost it. I like everything about this game from the simplicity of the rules to the collection of sets of cards to the claiming of routes. The game is also well-balanced between the desire to collect more cards and the need to claim routes before others get them. 

I consider the 1910 expansion essential, both for the larger cards and for the expanded ticket selection.

It's certainly a solid game and with hardly any down time and some planning to do it keeps you busy and directed. Problem is I find I'm not thinking deeply enough to get a good enough buzz out of it. I find it's better to only add scores up at the end and not use the track around the board, totalling scores over and over again is truely grueling.

Solid. A simple board along with easy to understand rules for young and old alike. You do need to guide younger players not familiar with US geography and help them a bit with understanding cities on their destination tickets.

Careful with the board as more trains are added so you don't knock them all over the place.

Played with the USA 1910 expansion and will continue to use that expansion going forward.  Would highly recommend adding the USA 1910 expansion for anyone that has Ticket to Ride.

Ticket to Ride is an interesting one to track on BGG.  I never know whether to track plays under the expansions or the base game, since you basically ignore everything except the trains and a deck of cards from the original.  I've leaned toward logging under expansions, but have not been consistent with it.

There's not a lot left to be said about Ticket to Ride that hasn't already been said.  It's a classic family game for a reason, and the elitists can pooh-pooh it all they want, but I still think it's a fantastic game that has stood the test of time very well.  The expansions add some neat twists, and the game is easy to teach.  Perhaps the best praise I can give to Ticket to Ride is to say that it's been a gateway game for family who really aren't gamers, and that is just wonderful.  I once organized a big family gathering at a rented house on the beach, and brought along some games to pass time in the evenings.  Two different people who were visiting went out and bought TTR within a week or two of the trip's end.  That's high praise coming from folks who hadn't played a board game in years.

My current ranking of the expansions / alt versions I've played:

1.) UK / Pennsylvania.  Both maps in this recent expansion are excellent.  The tech tree in UK is a lot of fun and gives you the opportunity to follow what other players are able to do and race to get access to the regions / routes that you want and need.  The set collection of the stocks in PA helps give alternatives to pulling tickets and makes end-game much more tense as you try to balance route size and chasing stock majorities.

2.) India / Switzerland.  I like that both of these maps are tighter, more heavily branched, so there's lots of competition, but less "oh, you took the one five train route going where I need to go, so now I have to come up with 15 different cards to work around it", because the links are typically closer together and shorter with more options.

3.) Original TTR.  Really solid, good ole USA map.  Fun with 1910 or the original rules.

4.) Africa.  I didn't really care for the way colors tended to cluster together.  If you are trying to get to a particular city, and it has two red routes facing the direction you're coming from, and you can't find any red, you're pretty well boned.  The terrain doubling mechanism was novel, but seemed to make for huge point swings that made it difficult to gauge who was the best target for blocking.  I wouldn't be in a hurry to play this map, given how many better choices there are.

5.) Rails and Sails.  Bad.  Bad bad bad.  The worst Ticket to Ride map by a huge margin.  The new depots combined with the two-card market made the game waaaayyyyyy more random.  The bigger board and higher piece count made the game wayyyyyyy longer than it should be.  This isn't just my least favorite of a game a like a lot.  This is a game I actively dislike.

Sometimes the simplest games are the most charming!  This may be the best light game I've played.  Always puts a smile on my face.  There's still some good strategy and thinking involved.  A game that everyone will surely enjoy - kids, grandparents, and even the significant others. FUN FUN FUN!  Grade: A

RATING: 7
Best gateway game of all time, as it introduces people to a simple game that involves tough decisions--as opposed to roll and move games with no choice. A mind blower for people brought up on Sorry and Monopoly.  The tension between in-game scoring (laying routes) and hidden end of game scoring (the tickets) makes this game interesting till the last turn.

Pretty fun game, although it could be made a bit faster by dealing out a few more cards in the beginning.  More entertaining with 3+ players, as I like having to weave paths through potential barriers.  I prefer this version to the latter versions (Marklin and Europe) as the other two seem to have added unnecessary complexity.

RATING: 8
A very enjoyable card drafting game, with area denial elements. Simple to teach, but subtle enough to permit tactics. While some randomness is present due to the card drafting mechanic, this can be managed somewhat by learning to correctly assess the situation at hand, and deduce the intentions of your opponents. (Counting card helps too!) The conflict is indirect, but the effect of your actions can create significant impact on the other players.

Rating history: 6|7...|8...|7.......|6..|5

Played 30+ times.
2p - lots
3p - lots
4p - some
5p - rare

2005: Played 20+ times. This game is WAAAAY simple, but somehow every playing this game gets a bit better. A cross between the lightness and theme of TransAmerica, the card drafting and turn angst of Union Pacific, and the route claiming of Empire Builder. And this game goes over INCREDIBLY well with non-gamers who seem to enjoy it even more than I do. A little duller with 2 players, but certainly quite good with any number.

July 2014: As you can see from my ratings history, there was a period of time where I quite enjoyed playing this game. But after 20+ plays, it comes to a point where it is easy to recognize when a player is going for a 20 point route, and then you have to block them, or match them. The gameplay itself is fine and has some tension, but 20 plays was enough of this game, and I am WAY past twenty plays. I feel like Union Pacific really is the better Moon train game - I still have that one at a 7. Ticket to Ride is down to a 5, and is close to going to a 4. I just don't want to play it anymore. I WON'T put it at a 4 though, because the game itself is fun for a while. Just not a lot of replayability in it for me.

Rather play:
Moon train game - Union Pacific
Light tactics game - Carcassonne
Short board game - Suburbia
Simple board game - Elfenland (3 rounds)

RATING: 6.8
The Underground & Ticket to Ride Europe I enjoy more.  Maybe if we played with the expansion, since this seems a little shallow--at least it is a few steps up from Trans-America.  I bought the expansion by accident--I am told the expansion makes this game--so now I want it.

1/4/11  “@AboutBoardGames: Look out! Monsters are invading Ticket to Ride: http://bit.ly/fyn1cR”. -- OK, maybe I'll finally break down and get TTR!

2/23/11  My prototypes are on hold while I work on a Ticket To Ride map. I even broke down and finally bought the game!

2/24/11  @brettspiel @55cards Great post! I'm not sure how I missed it. It's interesting that the best designed, perfectly branded map may not win.

2/24/11  @55cards @brettspiel I think I have a cool concept (who doesn't!), but it is a challenge to implement in the existing framework.

3/1/11  I think I've finished my research for my Ticket to Ride contest entry. Now to actually make the map.

3/13/11 Finished my Ticket to Ride board. Now I need to throw together some destination tickets before playtesting tomorrow night.

3/14/11 Couldn't playtest tonight because of Real Life. Instead of finishing my Ticket to Ride Destination Tickets, I spent the day in the ER.

3/21/11 Finally playtested my Ticket To Ride map. It seemed to play well and my "hook" went over quite well.

3/29/11  4-player Ticket To Ride playtest went very well. I got some suggestions for some changes that I need to mull over.

4/6/11  My Ticket to Ride contest entry is in the mail. #fingerscrossed

5/18/11  Can't wait to try the Ticket to Ride app for the ipad!

5/18/11  2 things: Ticket To Ride for the iPad is very well done and I'm very bad at Ticket to Ride.

5/19/11  OK...my first win on the Ticket to Ride app was a convincing one! http://t.co/kAe90hc

5/27/11  “@days_of_wonder: Ticket to Ride Map Contest Update http://t.co/TTZnePp”. Darn it! I didn't make the cut.

5/27/11  Proud Geek Dad moment #38...5-year-old wanted to learn to play the train game on the iPad (Ticket 2 Ride). He won his 2nd try (tutorial on).

6/9/11  @days_of_wonder It's a well-deserved honor. Ticket to Ride is a great app and has increased my appreciation for the physical game.

I really enjoy TtR.  It is a welcome change from Risk or other light boardgames.  Easy to explain and always fun to play, although easy to get bored with if you play it too much.

The 1910 expansion is also a must as after awhile you'll know the particular routes that are out there.

A great all around game.  In regards to the level of nerdiness needed to enjoy this game, I'd say its on a level with Settlers of Catan.  My retired parents enjoy it, and they have 0% nerd in them.  I'm 100% nerd and I enjoy it too.

Whatever you do, though, do NOT get the computer version and play against an AI over and over and over again to see how high a score you can actually get (386).  It burns you out on the game and makes it not fun anymore for a long time.

This is a great game for new and old gamers.  I'm not sure how to rate this game because it should be 10 based on it's gateway potential alone.  In my situation it helped turn family and friends into a weekly gaming group.  That's worth a lot!  I recommend this before Settlers of Catan as a gateway game for new folks.  I think it plays faster and has more eye candy than Settlers.  On a personal level I find the US map kind of boring and the small cards in this game are really a pain to hold and shuffle.  For those reasons I rate Marklin higher and prefer it of the two.  I have not played Europe yet.  I have to admit that I was put off by the Choo-Choo look of the box and bought it as a sacrifice to family gaming with the kids. Turns out I love the gameplay and I'm hooked!   The game has tension and decision making delivered with a minimum of rules.  I'm always happy to play it.

I really need much intimitadion to play this one again. I was really bored during the playtime. Kardinal und König seems to do everything much better than this. It is faster and it has real tension since the map and different areas are tighter. Also, it has fewer downtime and agonazing decisions. TtR has too long downtime between the relevant decions. I much rather play KuK than this.

Extremely simple rules and a relatively short playing time while still offering tough choices make this a great game to introduce people to the world of Designer Boardgames. Simple enough for anyone to learn quickly, but there's enough here to keep gamers interested and having fun. 
The endgame can get tedious though sometimes if you're just repeatedly drawing cards hoping to get the ones you need to finish out a ticket.

RATING: 5
[Set Collection, Hand Management, Trains] [5P:5, 4P:5] Whee, this feels like a Michael Schacht game! Well, it also actually feels like an Alan Moon game - too simple, rather dry, zero tension, generally random and completely boring. I usually find myself saying to myself "is this it?", "what's taking everyone so long?" and "doo bee doo bee doo". TtR will probably win the SdJ (update: it just did) which just reinforces that it doesn't have the "X" factor that I look for in my games of choice. However, the production values are topnotch, and Days of Wonder continues to crank out absolutely stunning games. Now we need them to start working on heavier games than fluff like Pirate's Cove, Queen's Necklace, Mystery of the Abbey, Ticket to Ride and Memoir '44. I get giddy when I think of them doing a more substantial game. Here's hoping they snag Knizia's next "gamer's game"! *** UPDATE: Okay, TtR is painless, and it's a decent choice for people who need a simple, low-depth game to introduce non-gamers to the hobby. It's certainly leaps and bounds ahead of Settlers and that awful, awful aberration called Carcassonne. If you must have a nice, shiny featherlight game for non-gamers, make it this one.

A hit and must-have gateway game. A little too light and too much luck (and too little interaction) to be an ultimate favorite, like the party game of board games, but it's perfect for new gamers, quick and easy, and after all these plays, still enjoyable.

Ticket to Ride gets boring fairly quickly, and the two strategies of "build peacefully and connect cities" and "fuck over other players" are always at odds and really the only two strategies in the game.

RATING: 8
Perhaps the quintessential gateway game, and probably a must have if you will be introducing hobby games to people.  Nonetheless, it just doesn't feel like a full meal when I play it. The decisions are not complex, nor is any one decision likely to hurt or help you a whole lot. I always have fun, but it's definitely light beer and not scotch.

If you are going to play this much, get TTR:1910. It adds more strategy and, just as importantly, normal sized cards.

Added a bunch of plays to it but the true number of plays are probably closer to a hundred. It was my gateway game, bought it on a fluke at a sale and loved it. It made me wonder what other kinds of games are out there and a new hobby was born. I feel like I owe a debt to the game for opening a new world to me. Before Ticket to Ride I mostly just played trivia games. These days it's too light of a game for me but I still play it with my mother who adores it which is why I also bought the Europe version.

I have the USA 1910 expansion

RATING: 8
Has become a staple in our family since we got it in December 2011. Very simple to teach but surprisingly difficult to master, as you need to adjust your strategy based on the tickets you get - do you go for longest cross country routes or do you have bad tickets for that which forces you to do blocking and going for random 6 car routes? Do you start completing your tickets early to seize critical routes or do you hoard cards so as not to tip your hand before you have all the needed cards? When do you force the game to end? The optimal answers to these questions differ with each game and better players will win the vast majority of the time, despite the randomness associated with drawing tickets, drawing cards, and whether you end up competing heavily for certain routes.

Another fun aspect to this game is aesthetic as routes criss cross the board. One game ended with such a beautiful pattern that I literally snapped a picture and made it my phone's lock screen for a couple months.

My only complaint is the variability associated with drawing tickets - it is possible to be at a huge disadvantage out of the gate if you draw poor initial tickets. So we've been experimenting with variants like starting with 6 tickets and keeping at least 3, or starting with 4 tickets and keeping at least 2, etc.

Our family loves gateway games that are light-to medium rules complexity with medium depth to them, and this game fits the bill perfectly, right along with Pandemic and Settlers of Catan. This game's terrific reputation as an awesome gateway game is well deserved.

Great game for playing with the family/nongamers/gamers alike! I hope to just find out how it is that I lose all the time to my wife! She dominates. Beautiful game! I love to play with 3 or more.

After dropping hours and hours into the online game, I've decided to see how the board-version measured up. This is a fantastic game, but it isn't the greatest thing ever. In fact, I honestly preferred the online version, because it is insanely fast (games are 1/3 of the board-time).

Here's my view: If a game is lacking player interaction, then it better be a mind-bend (worthy of some serious thought and consideration). Otherwise, I'll pass, because it is a game where people sit around the table, don't interact with each other, and play solitaire.

I've found the only interaction in this game to be either: a) when two or more people need some of the same routes (this is the best interaction this game offers but it doesn't happen as often as I'd like in a 4 player game), or b) when you decide to be a complete ass and play a train route that you don't need only to destroy someone else's plans (this is cheap and I don't like it).

When all is done and said, good game that is easy to teach and periodically fun to play but I'd rather spend my time elsewhere.

Előkelő helyezése ellenére nekem valahogy az első áték után nem jött be. Az alaktrészek szerintem siralmasan gyengék, ami eléggé megöli a hangulatot. A játékmenet meg 95%-ban szerencsére épít. Persze lehet, hogy ezt nem szép dolog felróni egy családi játéknak. Arra jó, hogy legyen egy apropó arra, hogy összeüljön a család vagy haverok, és közben eldumálgassunk. De ilyennel Dunát lehet rekeszteni.

Very good gateway game. While a bit more simplistic than later editions, the main mechanic is exactly the same. This edition doesn't have tunnels or stations which pushes it ahead of Europe for me, but it loses out to Märklin because it doesn't have passengers, either. No matter the edition, though, all of them make great gateways.

This is fine as a gateway game and easy to teach and I'm happy to have it for those situations, but not something I find myself wanting to play often.  The 2 player game isn't tense and crowded enough, and I think I would play this more if it were. Does the 1910 expansion and the Big Cities variant really make for a good 2 player experience?

Good gateway game, but it can run pretty long with a large group. I think I prefer smaller shorter maps to the USA map, but it is still fun and it's the only one where I can immediately find any city.

Not enough depth for my taste. I greatly prefer transporting cubes in Steam over the set collection of Ticket to Ride. However, Ticket to ride is pretty easy to set up and is a bit shorter than Steam.

iOS: I think I hit 300 plays of this on iOS.  The AI was very easy to beat, it would get in your way sometimes so you had to play ahead around that, but then it was a fairly laid back puzzle with a bit of gambling here and there.  It can be pretty cutthroat with real people trying to block each other, or you can kind of play multiplayer solitaire and do your own thing.  A fun train game that seems like a good 'gateway game'.  Some maps are better at some player counts than others.

I have played literally hundreds of games of this online.  I usually play at least once a week because it is so relaxing.  The rules are simple and production is beautiful. The tension in this game is wonderful, especially near the end.  If I have one complaint it is that the winner is sometimes decided by who drew the best cards.  But, sometimes it isn't - there is definitely skill in this game.  Easy to play with non-gamers too which is a big plus.

Upgraded the rating after having played in 4: there's definitely more interaction than in 3. The game is very simple but offers plenty of interesting tactical decisions, if not many agonizing ones (time pressure is not very high apart for the endgame); the rate would have been even higher with better quality cards, and with a solution for the color blind (I am color blind, and it's really tough to distinguish the colors of the routes on the board)

Received in Mail - 4/6/04. Scores of times both f-t-f and online. Rating this is difficult for me. It's a quick game, easy to teach, a great intro game for non-Euro gamers. And, it is equally good as a 2-player game. In all those respects, it deserves a 10. But is there enough depth to warrent a 10? Not in my book. It falls far short in depth and strategy. In those respects it rates a 6. Thus, over-all I would rate it a 7.5 to 8. When I want something fun and light with enough tension to keep my interest, this is the "Ticket." But when my destination is deeper involvement, this one doesn't take me there.

This one is a no-brainer.  It has a great feel to it, is very easy to teach, and I imagine it will be considered a classic 10 years from now.  One of the best family/group of friends board games out there.  

Update February 2013: Have finally gotten back into gaming after a sort of break, and this game is still a ton of fun. I keep expecting it to get old, but it really doesn't. There's a reason it's so popular.  

Update feb 2016: Ticket to ride is a modern classic without equal for playing with ANYONE. The only thing keeping me from giving it a 10 is I can't decide which version is my favorite, but you cannot go wrong with original Ticket to ride and the 1910 expansion. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.824
Was once the gateway game of choice. Maybe It's that too much online playing has drained the joy from this game, as the long route west-east strategy becomes more obvious, and the longest route bonus now seems more a flaw.  Has been made redundant by the 1910 expansion which seems to address these concerns (rating 6 - 18/12/08). UPDATE: Whilst i have not played the physical game for some time. This game is so good on the iPhone that rating increased to 7. In fact, difficult to see why i would play the physical version again (Dec 2013). UPDATE: Does get the occasional family play and still an enjoyable game (Rating 7.824, Jan 17).

I prefer European version, but a great house rule is that you can stop a player if you have locomotives (wild cards) equal to an opponent's number of played trains on their turn. Ie if someone wants a route and plays 4 whites, you can lay 4 wilds and you both lose the cards, but no trains are laid.

Excellent and simple game of building routes between cities.  The only drawback is that it sometimes plays slower than it should because turns can be very quick (drawing cards is a common turn), so play often gets stuck while a player sits there not realizing it is his turn. Works well with 4 and 5 players, I haven't played with fewer.

This is a classic, and for good reason! This game is fun for the whole family, it is super easy to explain and there is still enough strategy involved to make it interesting. Another plus for me, you can really screw your opponents by taking routes they want. Very fun game, no matter what map.

Also own:
-USA 1910: Because those little cards were just a bad idea.
-Europe: Map is more friendly, but I like the additions of tunnels and stations.
-Netherlands: I am from the Netherlands, so I had to have this map. The addition of money is an interesting one.

I've never actually played the original version before now. It's missing a couple of the extra things that the European version has. Ticket to Ride can feel like a real luck-based game for new players and a memory game for experienced players, and with too few players it's too much solitaire and more players means the blocking can get really frustrating. Still, for a card game with plastic trains, this might be our generation's canasta for when we are in our elderly years. An absolute gateway game but one I've never fully enjoyed.

I use this as a gateway game for playing with new or inexperienced gamers. I don't love it, but it is mildly engaging and super accessible.

This version has tiny train cards, which is quite unfortunate. I've played versions with standard cards and they are much nicer. Other versions add more elements to make the game more interesting as well - highly contested routes, tunnels, stations, and other innovations. Each of these adds a little - I think a more recent version might actually be a game I quite enjoy.

A game which is OK, but not great. I do like that it's a connection game where you're competing to make connections, and there's skill in choosing the tickets you need to achieve. However I don't like that invariably everybody else is taking the cards you need so you're frustrated from making the connections anyway.

I like games where you can make a great move that sets you up. That just doesn't happen in Ticket to Ride - you have to lay down your tracks one at a time and it becomes very obvious which direction you're heading in. Your opponents are never surprised by your brilliant move. There's a lot of tension in the game, but it's just "I hope I don't get screwed over". I much prefer games where the tension is "I hope nobody sees my brilliant plan".

Blockbuster family game with good reason: great components, easy rules with some interesting choices (mostly about whether to lay short tracks or wait for better cards to lay long tracks, and whether to block other people). One of the first modern boardgames I played, so it'll always have a special place in my heart :-)

Made the mistake of playing Ticket to Ride: Europe before the original, and thus the original seems a bit bland by comparison. Still a very good game, though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Ticket to Ride offers a light route connection/set collection game.  I enjoy playing this game with both new gamers, and fellow long timers.  The choices aren't difficult, but this game can get wonderfully cutthroat, and then it's a race to avoid complete disaster.  Familiarity with TtR aids in the gameplay and can turn what appears to be a rather mundane exercise in collecting cards into a fun, strategic (on the light side), screw your neighbor route connection game.  The U.S. is still my favorite of the maps, and with the addition of 1910 expansion has added replay value (but makes it harder to figure out your opponents intentions).  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Good game to bring to the table to get new players engaged and interested. The set collection is very straightforward and the ability to interact with opponents and block their routes creates enough tension to maintain interest to the end.  As is the case with Carcassonne, this gateway game is more satisfying with mean players.

Nice light filler which seems to be somewhat similar to Alhambra (during your turn you either draw a card, or use your cards to buy stuff that earns you VP-s), but has more decision points. The tickets are a lot of fun. Easy to learn, great for kids, but high level of luck. Still, it kind of grows on you, I seem to like it more than most of the people in our group. Best with five. Deserves the SdJ title.

Just bought 7/20/04. Played for the first time yesterday in 2 player game. It was much fun. I wonder though, about a 5 player game and the congestion on the board that might occur. Until I get to play the game with the group I'll reserve final judgement so this rating is based on the two games played in a two-player game. Revision: Played as a four player game over the weekend. Rating goes up to 8.5 Not sure if if can reach higher rating. Played with 5 players. Game was fine. My concerns about congestion were ill founded. Game played smoothly but not as quickly as is indicated.

A very popular train game, and for good reason.  It's relatively simple, quick to learn, full of suspense and doesn't take hours to play.  Best with 4-5 players.  The components are well made and the board is rich with detail.  One downside is that one or two players can tend to master the game after a few sessions and dominate over less experienced players.  Overall, it's a great game that hits the table often.

[Original comment] Excellent game. Our adult family group really enjoys this (as of August 2005, February 2006). Is played almost weekly. Good challenges, requires much planning and analysis, and some luck.

May 2009 -- This is still a favorite game for the family. However, with so many other fun games, and a little less gaming time, it doesn't get played as often as in the past. If it accommodated six players, it would be played more frequently.

October -- When we have fewer than 6 players for a game day, this (or TtR:Europe) is usually one we choose to play. It is definitely one of my wife's favorite games.

2013-November:  Still a bit family favorite. In fact, our grandson requested his own copy of this for a gift, and really enjoys playing it.

One of those games that have always made me wonder about the sanity of my friends, they just all seem to love playing it, but I just think the game is a little shallow in terms of strategy and the gameplay a little simple for me.

Superb game, plays equally well at the family level and the gamer level. Normally play with the long routes separated out and dealt separately.  Am also enjoying the British map from the unoffical expansions listed on BGG.  Quite like varying it slightly - eg playing with the Marklin edn rule about 10 pts for most tickets (instead of longest run) balances the 'go for the 6s' strategy somewhat

This is currently my favourite introductory game. Fast to teach, fun to play and nice to look at. Not a great deal of player interaction in the sense of trading or bidding, but it does arise as players begin to compete for routes. I find it can be played gently or ruthlessly. With five players there can be quite a tension around the table as competition for key routes heats up.

I liked this a lot at first, and I still think it's an excellent game to get non-gamers into the fun, but it just doesn't do much for me.  I like my light games to be quick or thematic.  This is neither.  The map and bits are great, but the cards were showing wear after just a few games (first DoW printing).  It all sums up to mediocrity and makes me wish I was playing [gameid=3348] instead.

Nice light game, but a rummy game with a board doesn't fool me into thinking it's more than that.  It is an excellent social game for married couple get together type stuff--but I'd hardly call that my favorite time or type of game to play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Definitely a classic; I'd play this one over and over, though the concept is pretty simple. And that's the point! Not a lot of choice, so the game moves quickly, fun to watch the routes build, but the players meet at various route points on the board, so it's lively enough. I bet my rating will go UP as time goes on.

RATING: 9
A great game that works extremely well among non-gamers. The theme has been a turnoff to some, in my experience at least. A great game for playing with your spouse, although mine seems to consistently crush me. Scales up very well, and I have a hard time deciding whether I prefer to play with more or fewer players, which tells me the game is solid no matter what. Grab the 1910 expansion if for no other reason than it comes with full-size cards.

I actually think that the best thing about this game is that it's beautiful to look at. Excellent components which makes it a joy to play - when I feel like playing.

In truth, the only reason I've got this as a 6 is that I've got enough plays under my belt that it's grown a bit stale.

Great game, easy to teach and easy to play but has enough randomness to make it always fresh.  Compared to Europe this is the better starting game, but I don't like the card size as much, they are much harder to shuffle.  I think Europe gives more variety in terms of routes, but this version plays much much better with 2 players.  Can't go wrong with either.

Unfortunately I just don't get this game a whole lot. Of the 3 gateways, this is my least favorite, and mostly has to do with the simplicity of the game. There is not very much strategy to this game, and the limited strategy that there is, everyone can pretty much get in their first couple of games. So, where's the challenge? It's still a fun 'activity' and won't really turn down a game of it, but wouldn't really suggest it. I guess why this is one of the better gateways--not a lot of challenge/strategy that people can't 'get'.

Pros:
* Easy to teach and it's usually very popular with non-gamers
* Components are both nice to look at and color/symbol coded to facilitate gameplay.
* Every turn has a nice tense feeling where you hope that your opponents don't see what you're up to and mess things up for you.

Cons:
* Too many long tracks and an incentive to just build a long consecutive track (because of the longest track bonus) leads to people just drawing massive amounts of cards and not really interacting with each other.
* Extra destination tickets are rarely drawn because of the above problem
* Too few destination tickets
* The cards are too small

The USA 1910 expansion solves much of the problems I have with this game. If you are going to play Ticket to Ride: USA, get the 1910 expansion.

RATING: 6
Here's the problem with TTR: played with new people, as a gateway game and without all the blocking/viciousness that can emerge from higher level play, it's boring.

Played in a vicious/blocking high level fashion, it's a little interesting, but I'll usually choose something else.

Fun with 3-4 but there's little interaction in a 2 player game as the board is simply too big. With 2P, TtR is merely multi-player solitaire and what a bore that is. I also find the ticket system to be broken - we don't have many trains left after finishing the initial 2-3 tickets thus no-one ever draws more tickets over train cards. Gets better with 3-4 players but I like my games to play well with 2 players.

We haven't played with the 1910 expansion but apparently it makes the game a whole lot better. In any case we swapped this out for the much preferred TtR: Europe.

For our 2 player games we use the "Mega" card set with the following variant:

-2 Sets of trains for each player
-Separate destination tickets for each set (color)
-1 set of train cards for both colors

You decide on each of your turns which set to use your cards on.

When you pull new destination tickets you must declare which set they are for BEFORE looking at them.

The game does not end until the player has reduced both of his sets to 2 trains or less.

Score each player's lowest color x2, highest x1
Example: Player A has the Red and Blue sets. 
Blue scores 80. Red scores 110.
Player A's total score would be 80 X 2 + 110 = 270

It was one of the first games I got post-Settlers.  It came in the same shipment as Dominion.  

This game is not Dominion, and while I can't hold that against it, it just can't hold my attention the way Dominion, or a game of that caliber, can.  

I mostly keep it around for other people, as I know they like it.  It's well designed, and super easy to teach someone, but if I'm going to spend an hour on a game, I just want more than this is offering.

To have such simple rules, this game is really good and interesting with many choices. This feeling was kept until the last 4-5 turns, where it mostly was a waiting on luck-of-draw of the only cards I needed to get 10p+10p instead of -10p, due to my only non-fullfilled ticket and I had no other real choice, so it dropped a level in my rating due to this. The components are among the best as usual with Days of Wonder. A drawback is that you keep so filled up with what you need yourself, so you don't have time and resources to hinder the other player and what cards they choose can give a good idea from the mid-game, where they are going.

Received for Christmas 2006.

Strategy is quite different playing with only 2 compared to 4 or 5. Playing with 3 is probably the worst; it gets crowded on the board, and you don't get to use multiple, parallel tracks between cities.

For me personally though, the game has faded a bit from its initial shine as it feels like rinse and repeat. However, there is a tension in when you are going to reveal your plan and when to build the most crucial parts of your network. If you start too early, it becomes easy to block you when people know where you want to build. If you are too late the good connections are taken. There is also a tension when you draw tickets, but other than that the game consists mostly of drawing cards. Personally I prefer the other games in the Ticket to Ride line more, but nothing beats the simplicity of the first game.

The game works well with any number of players.

Although I enjoy TTR, it is a bit frustrating when playing with a mixed group of people. For those who can't grasp the overall strategy of planning efficient routes, the game is little more than set collection with an occasional chance to lay pieces. However, that may just be the competitive nature in me because most people seem to have little trouble enjoying the game. It's not an immediate go-to for me, but still one that I think everyone should have in their collection.

RATING: 5
Three plays. Simple and inoffensive. I don't mind playing, but it doesn't really excite me that much. It's a little too frustrating when you spend four turns collecting cards and then someone grabs your link. Nice production values, though. Marco Polo Expedition is vaguely similar but much, much better I think.

A good game, and quick enough that it seems like there is always time for "one more game." Can be quite cut throat with three players, when the double-routes are reduced to single lines, and you can get frozen out of cities quickly. After ten or so games I've come to appreciate this game more and raised my rating a point.

Great Game. Excellent two player game for me and my wife. Hand management plays a key role in winning or losing. For anyone who enjoys rummy and it's variants, this game is for you. I also feel that the game scales very well from two to five players. After introducing this game to my sister, brother & sister in-law, mother in-law, and friends, it's been proven, that this is an excellent gateway game for new/non-gamers.

RATING: 9
Played 20+ Played with 3,4 and 5. This is a great game for the family. We played 3 times over the Easter break. Like with Elfenland, sensitive family members can get upset when a route they have been planning for an hour is maliciously messed up by another player in the last 5 minutes of play. The story about traveling around America in 7 days makes little sense. A more believable tale could have been thought up by Alan Moon which would have made the rules seem less abstract. Was enjoyed by a group who normally only play Trivial Pursuit. *UPDATE* This game is getting a lot of play and my respect is increasing. It stands up to competetive play online which is a good test.

*UPDATE* I have now played this game face to face over 30 times mostly with none gaming relatives. It is the perfect Christmas game. I'll promote it to a 9. Dec 11

I bought Ticket to Ride after hearing several recommendations from the Dice Tower and Tabletop. Normally, this wouldn't be a theme that I would enjoy, but the games board is beautiful and the mechanics are simple. I also like the fact that you can mess up someone's route by pure accident. Awesome!

THE intro game. Hands down if someone said they wanted to get into modern board gaming, unless they told me they despised trains this is game I would start with. Super, super easy to learn and play. Light strategy but still has meaningful decisions for the players to make. Can feel a bit mean with more than 3 players with potential path blocking. Warn people ahead of time it may happen to avoid hurt feelings.

RATING: 5
Not my type of game. Even when I'm winning, I feel powerless to the process. There is little strategy and thought involved when you either get to choose two random cards from the deck or two face-up cards that everyone may have already picked through. I never feel like I'm doing anything other than drawing cards and praying that at the very least I can complete my routes. I imagine that game play is improved by expansions or other base sets, but I am fairly turned off from the series at this point.

RATING: 6
game where just the core mechanic is left. its a fast played gateway game. in my opinion you got to do too little in your turn to make it engaging. i mean you pick two cards of a certain colour and then you're done. mechanic is good though and there is a bit tactical.

Lightweight for gamers, but much better than UP or Santa Fe Rails for casual family play.  There is still a spot for TransAmerica as it can be played much faster (although I wish TA had TtR's route card concept - possible expansion??)  Great bits, very easy to explain, could well be a gateway game as well as a game night game.  Not sure how long it will remain exciting, but will likely remain one of those unobjectionable staples.

I only really want to play it with exactly three players.  Tried TtR:E and thought it less elegant than the original, even if it is more of a gamer's game.

I don't really get it.  I really don't know what's supposed to be entertaining about it.  Everyone sits in silence and draws colored cards from the deck.  A lot of people seem to like the game, so I've got to give it another try, but I don't see what there is to like about TtR.  I played with three players; I guess with more, there's a greater feeling of tension as more people are competing for the same space, but I still don't really see myself liking it.

I can see why it won Game of the Year. It is beautifully made, simply designed, fun for all ages and aptitudes. The distribution of tickets can sometimes be quite unbalanced, but for a light game like this, I don't find that to be a problem.

I am a deep-strategy gamer, and I want my games to have hundreds of cardboard pieces and tome-like rulebooks.  At the very least, give me more than one freaking mechanic!

Which is why I hate myself for loving this game so much.  Every time I play it I think it's going to be simplistic, overly casual, or boring; but every time it's riveting, strategic, and memorable.

Right up there with carcassonne and settlers as a great "gateway" game.

Originally, I impulsively purchased this after playing it only once when a friend brought it over. I loved the fast paced turns and had a blast. The missplacement of Duluth was extremely funny. I later got fairly sick of it, and my copy is on permenant loan.

Like carcassonne, I've been enjoying this again in 2 minute increments on my iPhone.

Card draw severely trumps strategy.  You can literally win or lose off your starting tickets.  And drawing wilds will always beat drawing the same colors which will always beat crappy draws.  And theme-wise I am not sure how set collection causes trains routes to appear in unconnected areas.  I will still play many different gateways with new players, but this is not one of them.

Excellent card drafting and route building game, with a nice train theme and the customary gorgeous bits by Days of Wonder. Easy to explain and play so works really well as a gateway game.

Played once with the family.  Went over quite well and I believe it will see some more play.  I'd like to play it some more and will not turn down a game.  Good first impression.

Some really hated "screw you" factor of blocking other players routes once you figure out thier destinations.

I'd rate it higher but the components feel cheap, and make it more of a party game than one to pull out and really revel in. Also I'm not a big fan of the theme, but that's entirely my fault.

Ticket to Ride is a modern classic for a reason. It is simple yet engaging mechanics can be easily grasped even by children and I have yet to introduce the game to a group that dislikes it.
Plays best with 4-5 people.

Simplicity at its best.

I personally like the original (US map) version best.

To me the newer versions have just added more complexity (tunnels, bridges, ferries, etc.) without adding any extra fun.

One of the first "modern games" I bought... You may tire of playing it after some times, but it was clearly one of the responsibles for bringing a lot of my friends to the "modern board games genre" and I will always bring it to a game session with new potential gamers.

RATING: 9.2
What can I say about this now classic game? To people that are new to gaming, this (or one of its several sequels) is a must-have in your collection and is ideal for one of your first modern board games. (Throw out your Monopoly.) It's exciting even with the luck and takes a long time to tire of.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I finally played this, after having played the "Europe" version once years ago. I'm still unimpressed with the series. The games are not too bad if played purely as family entertainment, but the outcome depends too much on luck of the draw and (usually unintentional) interference of the other players. Also, the penalty for not fulfilling destination tickets is too high.

Accessibility is the ticket here.  This isn't one I tend to play with other gamers, but it's great for non-gamers, who can sit down and start playing right away.

RATING: 7.5
Update: After 30 games (base and expansions), I have grown to appreciate this game more than I once did. It works with almost any group. I have never played with anyone who really hated it. I do think they should have included some variants to account for the fact that the base game does not play very well with 2 or 3. Instead you have to buy an expansion to fix this problem. An alternate board side or built in mechanism using routes would have been nice.

Regardless the mechanic is good, and the theme is nice. This is one of the few games that everyone I have introduced it to has requested again --- all non gamers and including my wife who is notoriously picky. If you only play 2 or 3 you could skip this entirely and go straight for Nordic Countries, it is designed for a small group.

This is a simple and easy game. You can learn the rules in one minute. The only downside is that this game's premise is competition. You will need 4-5 players (I recommend 5 player games) to bring out it's full potential.

The kind of game that I'm most likely to say "take it or leave it" to. It's not that bad, decent actually,  but if you are playing with people who don't know how to play for fun, this one will end up generating some recriminations at the end "you blocked my only route, yadda, yadda, shut the fuck up already, yadda". If the game was a bit more complex, then I wouldn't mind that really (the whining that is), but in this particular case, someone is always going to be screwed, so unless you are a good sport, you may either want to avoid the game, or just put a lid on your complaints.

This game is the ultimate gateway game.  It is fun, simple, and fast.  I love it!  The computer version is awesome too.  I now rate this game a 7 because it is so much better with the 1910 expansion.  Bigger cards work wonders.

This game is truly a 10. It may not be the game that I want to play all of the time anymore, but this game rivals or may even best Catan at this point for the most converts into gaming. It's not even in my top 10 games of all time, but I can't discount it's genius. If you are just getting into the hobby, do yourself a favor and go buy this game right now. Accessible, fun, hidden objectives, set collection, board play, take that, long term strategy, quick tactical decisions, expandable, great art, easy to teach, short game time, addictive and not the nerdiest thing on the block (all due respect to all of us nerds). Must have in any gamers collection. Parents will love it around holidays and my wife surely loves it so all I can say is, GAMING PERFECTION!

Real fun and a good game to play with others who are not really into to games.  It has enough strategy to be fun, interactions with others and enough options to keep it interesting.

RATING: 7
Simple and fun, basically a set collection game with a train theme pasted on.  Strangely addictive.  I wish it had more choices and more conflict.  I find myself wanting the expansion even though I don't think it will fix either of my problems with the game.  I vascillate between disliking the game and playing it for 4 hours at a time.  The luck of the ticket draw can ruin a game, but the board is beautiful and the components are top notch.  The rating could go down a little but I don't see it ever going up.  My wife likes it and I can see pulling it out with non-gaming family, so thats a plus.

Update:  Dropped the initial rating...  this game is almost totally mindless.  It bores me after just a few plays.  I think the problem is that once you've got the 2 (maybe 3) winning tactics down, there isn't much here.  How much fun you will have playing this is directly proportional to how much fun the people you are playing it with are.  I guess thats true about all games but especially true about one as simple as TTR.

Still, I like this game.  You have to see it for what it is.  Full of luck, a filler, good for nongamers, etc.  This is what monopoly SHOULD have been!

A step up from Elfenland in that the choices are not as obvious. There are more decisions to be made. I had played before and when I introduced it to my family, I won the first few times. However, once they started getting cutthroat and not solely focusing on their own routes, things got much more interesting. Elfenland, by comparison, has less opportunity for this. However, knowing the ticket cards is a huge advantage new players have over old ones and I don't think that's a positive thing.

Newbies love this game.  I don't think it's the bee's knees (I greatly prefer Union Pacific), but it's got some strategic merit.  I prefer playing with 3 players than with 5 -- strategy is worth more than luck with fewer players.  One key to the game is to play as many 6-links as you can, even if they don't help your routes that much.  In fact, if you're really daring, take the two cheapest routes, then ignore them completely, and try to screw with the other people's routes... that can lead to some pretty big negative scores all around, but less for you, because you're just going for the most points in links.  And don't take new tickets -- they don't help, as far as I can tell.  A 6-link is better than most tickets.

Europe and Switzerland, with a very few improvements, fix what I dislike in the base game and are enjoyable..
Maybe 1910 fixes it; I never got the chance to try ity, and since I traded the base game away, I won't buy it myself.

Tried 1910 at last on the IPad. It improves on the base game dramatically, just like all its expansions.

RATING: 6.5
An easy "euro" type game (no dice).  Players draw cards and attempt to build railroad segments between cities to score points.  These segments are built using color coded cards.  As an example, one needs to hand in a set of colored cards equal to the lenght and color of the track one wants to build/own between two cities.

Tickets are double edged, in that they provide you with extra points if you complete the route listed on the ticket, else you loose the points.

Once a player's markers (45) are reduced to less than 3, the last turn of the game is played, then the points are counted and compared to find a winner.

Player interaction is limited, although one may block another player by building a segment of track which he/she thinks the other player needs in order to complete a ticket.

It's easy to understand why this has been so successful; the only choices are a few simple actions, and with colorful pieces it's enough to attract the casual gamer.  The more advanced gamer knows there more planning and reaction as well to win.

[Initial Impression: 7]
This train-themed game is simple enough to be enjoyed by the whole family, but introduces newer players to multiple options on each turn and multiple scoring possibilities.  This makes it a very good introductory game (although TtR: Europe may be even better for this because the stations mitigate some possible cutthroat blocking moves).  However, with only one action per turn, the game can really bog down with high player counts (4-5), as each player will typically draw cards, wait for everyone else to take a turn, and then draw more cards.  This makes it feel like you aren't doing anything but drawing cards for much of the game.  In fact, some players will hoard cards by simply drawing for the first half of the game, only laying track when their needed routes appear threatened by other players.  Such hoarding can be a very good strategy, because it increases your ability to claim longer (and high-scoring) routes later, while also limiting which color routes your opponents will be able to claim.  Good players will usually also block some routes that they don't need, making it more difficult for opponents to complete their destination tickets.  Such play can sometimes put off new gamers, so it is important to know your group before employing such cutthroat tactics.

Nice components (you should be wary if people start with describing components)

The game itself is a very light family game. It does it good job at that.
For me it has far too little player interaction & don't mean on the board, i mean above the board. Everyone keeps staring into their hand, constantly checking available cards & still open routes. And since all goals are hidden, there is not much talk about the game while playing it.
Could've easily played a computer game.

Trains Trains trains! A game of trains... Luck and strategy involved

Player takes two cards which (from 5 colours or 1 randomed) and once have sufficient number of color cards play and place trains according to the map.

Player with the most VP end of game wins. VP is based on number of trains placed - the longer the track more VP is awarded. There are mission cards to where player needs to connect two locations but if they do not by end of the game, their points will be deducted!

I love this game! Takes less than 20 minutes to explain and play a dummy round. 

Playable rating 8/10!

RATING: 6
I hate this game. Everybody has that reserved one time game where they can say "I hate this game, and you can't take that opinion away from me." I hate it like the Grinch hates Christmas, and I hate to see other people enjoy it even.

Still, I'll be a good sport and play it to the best of my ability, but don't mind me if I want to yawn my face off.

The game aims to be a gateway game and it is successful in that respect. There aren't a lot of options, and the depth you have is....well, you can potentially make a ton of decisions, but the decisions are extremely straightforward. Build your ticket.

I am giving this a 6 because it is a good gateway game, but I don't want to play it. No interaction with fellow players stops it from receiving a 7.

I'll probably always hold an element of nostalgia towards this game.  It's the first 'eurogame' that I had, which my fiancee bought for us, looking for something with a little more depth without getting overburdened by rules.  It's a game that I can teach to and play with anyone - family, friends, gamers, non-gamers.  It's fun each time.  What it lacks in depth, I think it makes up for in ease-of-gameplay and overall fun factor.

I've lowered my rating to an 8 though after playing games of irritation by the cards.  Basically, you can have a perfect setup of destination cards but never get the right car cards and lose.  Or the opposite - you'll have great car cards to setup any track you want but can't get a good chain of destination cards.  Better yet, when a good endgame strategy become shotgunning through destination cards hoping you pick one you're already close to, the other 90% of the game feels unnecessary and lame.  We may as well just randomly drop train pieces on the board and randomly pick destination cards and see who came closest.

It's an irritating problem that has driven me to not want to play this game much.  I'll keep it with a relatively high rating because it has provided a lot of fun and I'll probably still play it in the future, but I don't view it as highly as my other 9-rated games.

I really like this one. It involves a lot of thinking and some interesting strategy. One thing about it is the lack of any interaction between the players.

Strangely invokes the feeling of gambling for me. This is largely caused by the management of one's tickets - do I go for the big ticket score and risk losing everything, or satisfy some small tickets and scoot up the score track reliably.

Great game for people who aren't really into games. Simple rules, but enough strategy. This is a must game for people to own. It's rated a 7 because other expansions of the game are better, and we have house rules that change the point value of the "6-train track" because it's a bit broken.

A great family game, and it has the ability to be simplified for younger players.  The game gives a visually pleasing map with fun little trains, even though the train theme is a little weak.  

My copy is cobbled together with the 1890 expansion cards and downloaded map pasted on the back of TtR Europe.  It works great, and fits in the same box.

Down side, the game is more about set and hand management than trains.  Also, I find the Europe map and rules a better game, but most of my family game group prefer the familiarity of the USA map.

After some playings, all the games feel the same: lots of drawing for 15 turns, stopping to make 6 routes. Then, people decide to build their routes, and you may or may not get hosed. When someone moves away from the script, he gets blocked off and dies unless he has short tickets.

It's a classic. Though with the original USA map the problem is that someone only needs to build all the long trains and forget about their tickets and they end up netting themselves ~90 points total and they end the game 5 or so turns sooner than other players need. As a points control dynamic this is very effective and unless the other players get lucky they cannot beat it.

This problem is fixed brilliantly by the 1910 expansion.

“You choo choo choose me?" - Ralph Wiggum

GAMEPLAY
One of the most well-known designer board games out there it has recently seen a huge influx of players with a very well done ios version of the game. The game turn consists of three simple choices. Pick up cards, play a train route by playing cards, or get more route cards. It's great because rounds go very quickly and no one feels left out. There is no direct interaction between players, but it is possible to block others from connecting routes.

COMPONENTS
The board is a good quality card stock and the cards are smaller than playing cards so small hands won’t have a problem. Days of wonder includes some extra trains of each color in case you lose some. Make sure to count out your trains before each game. The art throughout is wonderful, The trains themselves leave something to be desired, I would like to see wooden trains but that's nitpicking.

THEME
The base game uses a map of America which has about 40 cities on it. Connecting routes throughout the country is simple and resonates with most people as a traveling adventure. The small disconnect is that the players don’t have to connect the routes in sequence. This abstraction doesn’t distract from the enjoyment.

WHO IS IT FOR?
This game is for everybody. Really. I entertained three nephews ages 15, 16, and 18 recently. None of them gamers and they all had a great time. Families with children as young as 8 will have a great time with games lasting about 45 minutes. Even power gamers will enjoy it once in a while; there is light strategy based on your route cards and blocking the other players. For established gamers use it as a gateway for your friends you would like to engage in your hobby.

Yes, I've heard people say this is a "set collection" game, but it's simple fun nevertheless. Simple, quick, fun. It "feels" like one is building a railroad network, much like Railroad Tycoon, without the economics, but with all the desperation and paranoia as players fight to connect their cities. It seems to be a very good gateway game too. The 1910 expansion is a definite must have, as it has larger cards and more destinations.

Update (10/30/11): All plays recorded in the "1910" entry.

RATING: 8
A feather-light gateway game that neatly unhorses [gameid=13] as the premier intro to hobby boardgaming.*  Surprisingly tense for such a simple setup.  You get to play tactically in the now, maneuver for mid-range goals as well as nurture an overall strategy.  Can be taught and grokked in moments; bright colors and beautiful art design make it a sensual pleasure to play.  Rating is probably slightly higher for newbies and slightly lower for hardcore gamers.  Still, an excellent way for veterans of the psychic wars to disengage, drop the intellect into neutral and just coast pleasantly along as a warm-up, a night-ender or as a relaxing activity when otherwise impaired.

Recommended!

UPDATE:  Okay, it's just Rummy with scoring sets on a board, and secret scoring goals on the Ticket cards.  And like Rummy it's a mild social game.  An "eat, drink & be merry with good friends" game.  Played seriously or in silence it's stupid.  It's for chillin' while counting cards.

UP-UPDATE:  The only way I can play this game and maintain my sanity anymore is to pretend the board is the yarn map at FBI headquarters where they're tracking all those random railway murders.  Why did I have to get to Little Rock so damn bad?

I've tried a bunch of different train games, and I still think TtR is the best.  It's clean and easy to learn.  The player interaction is relatively low in the original, but some variations (like Märklin) add more.

My game of choice for easing non-gamers into euros.  Tons of fun.  I highly recommend removing the 7 15+ routes and dealing 1 to each player (like in TTR:E) and discarding the rest.  Getting 2 compatible high-point routes in the initial draw is tough to beat.  Or, play with the 1910 or Big Cities load cards.

Fun game for 2-4 players. Competitive game can lead to cutthroat decisions, which can upset younger children. Nothing worse than almost completing a ticket and getting cut off near the end of the game. Good way to teach strategy and rudimentary US geography to younger children. Also a good, light competitive game for a group of adults. Games last 30-60 minutes.

A classic game that for some reason, takes multiple times to play before loving it.  But, the more it is played, the more it is loved.  I highly recommend the 1910 Expansion, as you get full sized cards to replace the mini-deck.

I've only played 5 times or so, but I feel like if you have bad tickets on the first draw, a feeling of impending doom descends on me and makes it just a so-so game.  But it's light, fast, and the doom doesn't last as long as other games where you feel screwed from the outset.

Excellent family game, and a fantastic introduction to the tabletop world. Fast-moving, with a constant feeling of not having enough time (or trains!) to do everything you want. However, it is VERY luck-based, and there's not a lot of room for strategy.

I won Ticket to Ride (along with Pass the Pigs and a €20 voucher) in the BoardGamer.ie giveaway!

Set collection meets route completion.  But takes too long for the weight of game. 

Some of the new games in the Ticket to Ride family are better.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A colourful set collection and route building game with universal appeal. There are a couple of fairly minor downsides: luck of the draw can't be eliminated from the initial tickets that you get, and once you've completed your first 2/3 tickets the game's nearly over, so taking more is a high risk play. The key to winning is to save your cards to build the longer links and not get rushed into building the shortest route to your destination. The US map is a bit bland when compared with later versions, but it's the balance between most of the scoring methods that makes this game, imbalance would make it half as good. The 1910 update goes a long way to solving the ticket problem, so I rarely play without it, but the base game is fine for casual play.

When I tell people I play board games for a hobby, there's always the stigma that they think I spend hours and hours playing games like Monopoly and Candy Land. Not so. And if you're on this site reading this review, you probably know what I mean. So, in an effort to share our wonderful hobby we sometimes need those games that bridge the gap between the hardcore enthusiast, and the person who thinks Clue is a brain burner.

Enter Ticket to Ride! This is one of my go-to gateway games. You can teach it in about 5 minutes, and the game can be played within an hour...depending on your players of course.

And it's a pretty easy sell to. A train game of building railroads across the country. Connecting cities from one coast to another. There are all sorts of different sizes of tracks, that when claimed, give you victory points. This is a set collection game (i.e. you collect different sets of different colored train cars to claim routes). But the key to victory is in each players specific "tickets." These tickets are hidden information, for your eyes only. On them are two cities that you need to connect with a continuous railroad. At the end of the game, you score more points for completing these tickets. But beware, you will also go back that many points for NOT completing them!
This game is perfect for families. And the last few rounds always provide nail-biting tension that just seems to make the game enjoyable as you're all desperately trying to finish routes. Oh, and route blocking is perfectly legal!

Unlike most of my friends, I enjoy this game more when it's played cutthroat. If everyone only focuses on finishing their own routes and not on screwing the others, then finishing routes becomes too easy and the game goes to whoever draws the best tickets. If that turns out to be you, then sure you want a friendly game. If it's not, then you need to attack. But others seem to think this spoils the fun. Hmph.

July 5th, 2007, I played my 2nd game. It's a quick learn (less than 5min) and quick play (~30min for 3 player). It does have a good balance of luck and strategy going for it, perhaps more luck. You build secret routes connecting two cities. Your opponents see your line forming, however they don't know your cities. You get more points the longer your route is between cities. Special bonus goes to the longest connected rail line. I'd recommend giving this a gameplay and consideration putting it into your rotation of games to play on a regular basis.

Fun in a mindless sort of way.  I'd almost compare it to Lost Cities in that it could probably play itself yet is engaging to players for some reason.  I much prefer this over Europe just because I know where everything is and there aren't all those stupid tunnels and superfluous add-ons.

Some of my friends love this game. I hate it. The gameplay is frustrating; it feels like it should be a strategy game but your plans fall apart so often it doesn't feel like it worth putting in the effort to strategize. The game does not encourage social interaction - no trading resources, no negotiating with your competitors, so it doesn't even have that to make up for my lack of enjoyment of the gameplay.

Great game for all, casual players will love the simplicity of the rules, and seasoned board game veterans will love the ability to really foul up your opponents plans by blocking their routes.  The idea is you have route cards and train cars and you are trying to connect the routes across the USA, the game play is really fun and simple for a player of any skill level.

Maybe I need to give this game a few more plays.  It leaves me with an empty feeling, like my strategy doesn't really matter.

Update 1/16,12: I picked up the 1910 Expansion and have played a couple of times.  One game I claimed as many 6 space connections as possible and ended the game before the other players knew what was happening.  I'm starting to see some possibilities with blocking and bonus points to be had.  The group that first taught me the game didn't do any blocking, etc., so it was boring just placing trains down.

Can't go wrong with Ticket to Ride. I highly enjoy it. Although it will probably bump up a bit in rating once I can get my hands on the 1910 expansion which just makes the game that much better.

Description: Collect sets of colored cards to build your train line. Your goal is to complete secret missions dealt at the start of the game.

Pro: Simple and easy to understand. Great little plastic trains. Missions provide replayability.

Con: No depth of strategy. Cards make the game somewhat random.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Ticket to ride is clearly a well thoughtout and well made game. 

This game offers an absolutely beautiful game board with colorful pieces and an easy to read map.   It's fairly easy to learn and there are many ways to pull out the victory in this crazy train ride of a game.

The issue i have with this game is in the gameplay itself.  It's just simply not a game that anyone seems to get too rallied up or emotional over.  Its fun, and requires strategy,  however i dont feel the gameplay offers the wow factor.

With all this in consideration i give ticket to ride a 7.5 and one thumbs up.

A fairly decent family game, in which you are collecting sets of cards in order to claim train routes. 

Works well as a a gateway game, very simple rules and quick to get into.  I like any game that has missions of some description and as such I like the ticket mechanic here, you are always trying to connect two towns in order to score maximum points.

Only thing I don't like is the fact that seem cities can be blocked entirely from all directions quite quickly, this can mean that when drawing a new ticket all the options are impossible, meaning that by simply trying to draw new tickets you are guaranteed to lose points at the end of the game.  This is unlikely but can certainly happen, I believe that some of the expansions address this issue.

Overall, a nice game to introduce to non gamers and children, not much to keep a seasoned gamer interested though unfortunately.

Picked it up since we had all the other Ticket to Ride games and wanted to complete our collection. It doesn't see much play in our house though. We played and tried it but it seemed bland without tunnels and nothing really unique to it like the other boards we played. Of course, this game came out first.

It's still a good game but I would have rather just bought the board and not the entire game again.

RATING: 8.5
Best gateway game I have, and one of the best games in my collection.  This game has been successful, at least to some degree, with every group I have shown it to.  Don't be fooled by the simplicity in the game design, there is a lot of strategy to be had with Ticket to Ride.

That being said, you absolutely, positively, need the 1910 expansion for this game.  The cards that come stock with this game are tiny, making it a hassle to read destinations, and shuffle train cards.  You can end up holding a lot of cards in your hand, so the small cards are terrible.  Aside from that complaint, the rest of the components are really nice.  Nicest board I own, it really impresses people the first time they play.

Another small complaint I have is that the game ends very abruptly, right when you feel like you are getting into the groove, someone runs out of trains and you only have 1 more turn.  This can be very strategic, because you can really mess other players up by trying to play a faster game, but I feel like the pacing is just a tad off.  The rest of the game is great though.

I read the rules and had to pick up this game.  It was a risk since trains don't really appeal to me.  It's a good thing I did; it's one of my group's favorite games in my collection.  The game is very quick and tense as players fight and worm their way between cities to complete their tickets.  Very cutthroat game with three players, but less so with four.  Unfortunately, you can *easily* get screwed by another player (intentionally or not); that lowers the score by a point.  (I've traded the game away since picking up TtR Europe, because it is superior in every way.)

RATING: 5
With one play under my belt, I'm sad to say, given all the recommendations from friends, I'm underwhelmed. Just on sight alone, I would have guessed there were opportunities afoot to lose my lines or deal with other players to exchange them. Instead, once somebody was able to build on a one-train track, it was gone. I made both route tickets I opted to keep, sure, but the game just sat there for me. There's little room, in my opinion, with just two cards on a draw turn, to sense somebody going in a certain direction and work on trying to stop them. You're just hoping the trains you build are enough to make your tickets, and enough to stop others from overtaking you. I'd try it again to see which way the scales tip: towards the "pass" pile, or towards the "play" pile. On first glance of the comments, it seems people were really enamored with it when it came out. The low scores are more recent.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a game anyone new to board games should play.  It is essentially a route building game where you collect different colored train cards to be able to connect cities across the country.  You get points for making longer connections, and bonus points at the end for having the longest train network.

After multiple playings this game is fun and I would play again but probably wouldn't be the one to suggest playing it. I fear that the same simplicity that makes this a great starter game in the eyes of many will equal shallowness and boredom upon too many repeat playings. However, it hasn't happened yet.  (Update: now it has)

Most annoying of all is the choice of components.  I hate the fact that many euros use non-standard card sizes.  The small cards in many euros are annoying, but often forgivable because the cards are usually only a small part of the game.  However, ANY game which focuses primarily on card play including BLUE MOON and Ticket to Ride should most definitely stick with standard sized cards.  They are what we are all used to holding comfortably and can be protected from wear by sleeves if heavily played.

Ask yourself this question, why is this better than Monopoly? Honestly think about it and you realize how overrated this game is...36??????????. (I am not a big fan of Monopoly BTW)

This is probably more random, same amount of luck (card draw vs. dice), same amount of strategy (very very little)although Monopoly probably has more, they are both set collection, the only bonus is this is over faster but most of the game all you do is draw cards like "GO FISH"? This is fun? Almost no choices to make here, pull a ticket, pull some more cards or build a route.

Monopoly at least has trading & negotiation, building up properties and an economic factor that makes it fun getting rich. The first 2 games of this I thought it wasn't bad and could see why people liked it but then it became very uninteresting and repetitive after that, this would have been somewhat better off being shorter and therefore not a bad filler, as it is it plays like a LONG filler but can still be used as a 'gateway game'. 

This gets rated one fraction below Monopoly and Europe is only a tad better but then its a tad longer which is not good for these kind of games. 

If you are looking for a very light gateway game that kids could play this certainly fits the bill. If you want a good gateway game that also has some substance and meaningful decisions to make keep looking.

Playing Ticket to Ride does not tire me out like most games do, and that makes it special. I actually relax as I draw cards and place my trains on routes. I find it soothing.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
I don't really get it - what is so compelling about drawing two cards and claiming routes?  This game is BORING...

Negatives: it is repetitive, it has little to no replay value, it has few if any strategic decisions, it has few tactical decisions, and it is not even a proper train game.

Pluses: you can think about other games while you're playing, it is good for the younger crowd, you can play with the plastic trains and put them in little symmetric lines, and that's about it.

RATING: 6.2
In Ticket to Ride, players vie to create the most valuable train network using a limited number of route markers.  This is the game that introduced me to the world of designer board games.  While I am not always eager to put it back on the table now that I favor games with deeper game play, once play begins I have a great time strategizing my routes and laying down some track.  This should be a great family game.

Suffers a lot in comparison to something like 20th Century Limited, but it's still a pleasant enough gateway game. The biggest problem for me is just luck of the draw in the end game goal cards, especially the ones you pick up partway through the game. Sometimes they'll all be basically going the other direction from what you have and other times you'll pick up two cards you already have done.

Very fun and simple game. This game has seen a lot of play time and is a great introduction to boardgames for people that haven't played much beyond your typically thought of (i.e. monopoly) boardgame.  

Very simple mechanics and yet very tense play.

We have taught this to several non-gamers who have later gone out and purchased their own copy.

So far this is my favorite of the series, though the only other two I've played are [GameID=14996] and [GameID=21348].

All but four of my recorded games are played with the 1910 expansion cards and I have at least a dozen plays of this from before I started recording games.

No, this won't replace Transamerica in my lineup, as some may lead you to believe. Don't get me wrong, this is an excellent game. Tight and tough, where you feel as if you need to lock up a few key connections immediately, and sometimes you really must! This is a  longer and more challenging game than Transamerica. While TA is high on my list due to its simplicity and fast play, TTR is great when you need a little more game. This is my 2nd favorite Alan Moon game to date after Union Pacific. ***Special thanks to gamesurplus.com for this game!***

Players either draft rail car cards, play melds of these cards to connect cities together (and score points), or draw ticket cards (hidden agenda points). Most points wins. It's a fun meld/connection game, looks wonderful, and like many Moon games it's quite derivative with that "I've seen this before" air about it. Sits between ultra-fluffy TransAmerica and more meaty Santa Fe Rails. Looks like it's aimed at families, and I can see it being a strong SdJ contender.

I feel like I should like this more than I do.  Maybe I just revolt because other people like it so much?  I can't think of any strong reason why I don't like the game, and the mechanics seem sound.  Maybe I just hate the randomness of the route cards and getting blocked off from what I'm trying to do.

I have the dice expansion and haven't tried it that way yet.  If it shortens the game up as much as people seem to think, then it might make me enjoy it more.  I think I'd really like this game as a filler.

Ticket to Ride is my gateway game of choice. It always seems to go over well with new players thanks to its simple mechanics and enough luck to make the game feel competitive, but veteran players also enjoy it thanks to plenty of advanced tactics that give them a better shot at winning.

For the USA map (which is a fine starting point for the series), I recommend it in all cases except for two players. There is too much empty space on the board without at least three playing. Luckily, there are plenty of other maps in the series that play great with two.

Not a terrible game, but a bit heavy on luck, and I don't find most of the decisions very tense.  It's entertaining for what it is but it doesn't fit in any of my preferred niches - it's too light to be challenging, not interactive enough to have real conflict, and it lacks the wild swings of fate that make you say "Oh crap!" or "Ha! In your face!" In the end I'll never ask for it, but will play it and sort of enjoy it if it hits the table.

My rating of 3 is misleading. It's a good game, but I really don't like to play it. It's disappointingly simple -- a game for kids or non-gamers. I'd call it a gateway game only if you're looking for a gateway to exit gaming, not enter it.

[b]Me[/b]: The game is way too easy.
[b]Wife[/b]: Then why do you always lose when we play it?
[b]Me[/b]: Because my brain shuts down and I just try to rush the end of the game. You're busy going for the longest route and I [i]really don't care[/i].

Always a staple.  The strategy does get a little simplistic and old after a while, but we still return to it on occasion for a simpler game compared to many of the other TtRs and Catans and such.  Colorful, fun theme, and enough balance that a cutthroat strategist just coming to the game and a person who is less into games can enjoy a couple games.  Recommend Pennsylvania (in the UK set) or Asia team as the top follow-ons.  Probably needs the 1910 expansion because there a few too many routes such that they get predictable and obvious (for those choosing to focus on them).

RATING: 8
The awesome thing about Ticket to Ride is that the decisions you have to make each turn are very small and manageable. This makes it easy to teach new players and good for parties where a lot of conversation is happening while you play. The price it pays for simplifying each turn, however, is pushing all the complexity to the end of the game when scores are finally totaled up. One or two sticklers almost always get stuck doing all the scoring while everyone else shrugs and walks away without really knowing who won. Everyone still always seems to have fun, though.

Good fun, easy to play with the kids. 

The small tickets and cards are a little fiddly, although solved by the 1910 expansion.  

OK with two, but better with more.

TTR is a good gateway game, and one my wife and I still enjoy playing. It has not yet entered into the realm of "we can't play this anymore" like Carcasonne. That game may lead to my wife enacting spousal abuse on me if we continued to play it.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (April 2010)

One of the first games I ever played. At that time I actually liked the game, but nowadays I find the game to be very boring so I almost always do my best to avoid playing this although I can be convinced (if there is no other game available).

The problem is that I feel the game have obvious choices (always the same strategy), way too random for my liking (either you got the cards and tickets you need or you don`t) and also too light. In general I dislike games from Days of Wonders for those same reasons.

On the other hand the game is perfect to play with the family or to introduce new gamers to the hobby. It also have gorgeous components.

Current Rating: 3.0

I can't imagine playing this hardcore gamers for 10 seconds.  Its a fun family game but more akin to replacing Monopoly with Grandma rather than a "real game".  Its worth playing with a certain crowd but at its heart, its really a rummy game and is not a gateway game IMHO - it doesn't lead anywhere.

RATING: 8
Ticket to Ride is simply the best game I've used for introducing people to gaming.

It is quickly picked up, it is fun for most, it does involve some thought, tension in timing, and risk in gambling (the destination tickets). The other important aspect of the game is the bonding and socializing of the players. That is true gaming interaction betwixt the gamers. Socializing is also the main lure to draw the new people back to gaming.

If you have a great night, even a relaxing night, with laughs and some gaming...well, you're going to get repeat players.
As long as I have people to play with, people to share my life with, people who will play my games I will be happy; and I will find (or create) deeper game groups too.

It's all about balance, and that's something that Ticket to Ride has. It's why the game works. It's why people learn it quick, it's why people come back to it. You can talk. You can laugh. You can block others. You can take risks. You can plan. 
Ticket to Ride has a very important element in its design; it's got the basics most gamers (even extremely casual ones) grew up with and it's close to card games they played. It doesn't hurt the head when playing (though I've seen lots of pained faces brooding over their cards and the board) and it allows for people to relax and talk. It removes the "chess" fear (think of math anxiety and you'll know what I'm talking about) from new players.

Is it the best gateway game? Yep.

My wife would probably rate this a 10. It's fun for what it is, and I've taught it to a number of people. My biggest problem with this game is its cost. My wife and I have both brought it to school to play with our classes at various times and a bunch of students think its cool and want to get a copy for themselves. Then one of us has to break the news that the game is $50 and that excitement dies down really fast.

Own the iPad version. Played the F2F version about 2 times. Preferred the Europe map as it contains less 6-train routes.

A good, solid game with straightforward rules. Has a few problems with counting points, and is slightly too chancy for my taste - getting hosed by plain poor luck is far easier than in dice-based wargames, for example. In my experience, Ticket to Ride is good for light gaming with people who are not hard-core boardgamers.

A lot of fun, great introduction to board games. Originally, I had this rated as a seven, but that was based on plays with two or three players. With four or five players, it can be pretty intense and is more fun, so I'm upgrading to an eight. Like so many of you, this has replaced Settlers as my choice for introducing non-gamers to the hobby.

Only played online, but after first play, this game _may_ be too lucky.  Seems like the best strategy is simply to acquire cards until you can't hold anymore.  Then build like mad, then get more tickets.  Lather, rinse, repeat.

Will try some more. . .

I hate this game. It's slow, boring, and nowhere near satisfying. Also, the rules are all but ironclad. 

Protip: If someone makes you play this against your will, there is no rule for how many cards you can hold in your hand. Just take all the red cards or something. Pretty soon, the people playing with you will get frustrated and let you quit. Also, they will never ask you to play this horrid game again. Hilariously enough, you didn't even break any rules or cheat.

RATING: 7
An average game at best... not one of Mr. Moon's better efforts.  Another SdJ winner that failed to grab my interest.  If you want an Alan Moon train game, you are far better off with either Union Pacific or Freight Train.  I really don't understand what all the fuss is about... I've played the game a few times now and, while I did enjoy the game, did not find it much fun.  According to the ratings here at the 'Geek a 6, "Ok game, some fun or challenge at least, will play sporadically if in the right mood," hits the nail on the head for me.

Since I've added this to my Steam account (along with the 1910 expansion), I've played hundreds of games.  My opinion has gone up, but not enough to rate it higher.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
While it is a solid game, this kind of train games tend to bore me for some reason. It just feels a bit too dry. For the same reason, I stay away from Flashpoint, or Police Precinct. 

I understand that the game is very easy to get into, but for me, I would recommend other games with better themes. If I am playing with older people, or just very gentle folks (i.e. church people) then this would be one to consider.

Played a few times and I like it. It's a good thinking game but not a brain burner. Decently quick to play. The number of players vastly changes how to play the game, which can be good or bad depending on how you personally like to play.  Downside seems to be the "blocking aspect", doesn't seem worth it, and I like direct confrontation.  (Downgraded from 8 to 7.5)

Decent game, perhaps deserves a better score than I gave it. I don't really find myself wanting to play it too often, but it's probably the best "gateway" game and it is easy for initiates and "non-gamers" to get into. I feel like I could rate this higher if the player count were higher than 5 in the base game (so that it can be played at large family gatherings). Still, good game nonetheless.

Everyone is right: it's a great family game, where an 8yo can play an 80yo.  I especially like how it can be played so many ways: cut-throat, and/or leisurely, and/or bluffing.

The perfect gateway game.  From the familiar map (for people in the US anyway), to the rummy-style card collecting and route-building, this game gets it all just right.  The turns move quickly, there's only indirect player interaction and I feel like everyone gets a sense of accomplishment, even if they didn't win.  The only minor drawbacks are the small cards it ships with (fixed with the 1910 expansion) and I would prefer wooden trains to plastic.  These small issues do not detract from the fact that this should be in everyone's collection.

With elegantly simple gameplay, Ticket to Ride can be learned in under 15 minutes, while providing players with intense strategic and tactical decisions every turn. Players collect cards of various types of train cars they then use to claim railway routes in North America. The longer the routes, the more points they earn. Additional points come to those who fulfill Destination Tickets – goal cards that connect distant cities; and to the player who builds the longest continuous route.

Ticket to Ride offers fun for all ages and for gamers and non-gamers. While it is certainly a lighter game, there is plenty of strategy here.

Important step in the development of European games in North America: this is a simple game in which players compete for route completion between cities across North America for points. Fail to get the route finished by the end, you lose those points. The artwork is beautiful, routes are marked with detailed plastic train markers, and the game is easily graspable for kids too. Fun for the whole family!

BIG PLUS: quality of pieces, ease of play, replay ability
MINUS: easy to see when you're losing, tiny cards

Why did I wait so long to play this?  It's a truly amazing game!  So simple and yet so enjoyable and fast!  I can see two player may become cutthroat but, there always seems to be a possible way to get to your location so, it works for me.  I can imagine playing with 4 or 5 players, this game really becomes about finding the best ways to your location as tracks get taken by other players.  It's a great one and something I look forward to playing again in the future.

I've upped my score on this to an 8, and a part of me really want to give this a "9". It really is just about the best family game around. Easy to learn and play.

Was a bit concerned that it might be too simplistic, but I wanted more games for six players so I bought it anyway. Turns out I remembered incorrectly and max players is five (got the last copy from the shop window so didn't actually look at the game), but it is such an excellent game I'm not complaining. Brought it home, read the rules and played five straight games with the wife, went here and entered a rating of 8 (but can't decide if I should have put a 9).  :)
Update: Played 12 times in the first three days, rating upped to 9.

Update: Reduced rating to 8 due to some burn-out. Still a very good game, but you can get too much of a good thing.

Extremely easy to explain, but very tense game, even after 30+ games. Very good with 5 and 3 players. With 2 or 4 players there is not always so much competition, but it is still enjoyable. With 2 players it seems that going for the 6 train routes as fast as possible is the best strategy. (24 dec 09 after 44 plays)

Liked it quite a bit when it first came out, but now all the expansions seem better (something that's not true with many other games).  The problem with the original was you could actually win by just taking all the 15-point links, make a couple of tickets and then get the longest train bonus.  I actually prefer versions that emphasize routes and getting more tickets and the 1910 version, which emphasizes tickets (with the Globemaster bonus for completed tickets), offers different tickets than the original came, and finally the larger size and more colorful train cards is far more enjoyable than the original.

Always puzzled why anyone would think this is better than the obviously superior TTR: Europe

I saw a post where someone was saying they don't like Europe because the stations make blocking pointless and take away the tension. At least I have a view on why some might prefer Original. But of course you lose points using your stations, so if your opponents use them and you don't you get an advantage. 

Personally think stations, tunnels and ferries make it such a much better game thier really is no comparison, but to each there own.

RATING: 9
This game is pure 100% Euro genius.  It's simple to learn and addictive to play.  I've only played the American version so far but I have to say, my favorite part, hands down, is the extra points for having the longest train.  Nothing for the quickest route.  Nothing for the most efficient train line.  Nope.  In the American version, you get 10 extra points just for having the biggest, longest train that you can take from San Francisco to Orlando and still get to see most of Montana, North Dakota, and Maine along the way.  'MURICA!  Great game.

The random nature of how the large contracts are drawn significantly reduces the enjoyment of the game for me.  TTR Europe fixes this by allocating only one large contract per player.  Except for being more familiar with the geography of the United States, I find most of the other versions of TTR to be preferable to this one.

Start with route cards and figure out a path. Then collect the number of colored cards that match a track segment. Grey segments can allow any cards of the same color to be used. Engines are wild cards. Track segments score points with longer track segments scoring more points.  Complete the routes on the cards to score additional points. It is a nice family game.

Fast-paced, fun game - great gateway game (better for beginners who aren't into the trading etc. of Settlers or Bohnanza).  Essentially a game of rummy played on a map with trains :-)  Love the dynamics set up by the tickets. Kudos to Alan R Moon

(NB between the original and TTR Marklin I'm ambivalent -- TTR has more going for it, but setup is a bit too fiddly for a filler)

The hit of the summer (2005) so far. Everybody wants to play it. The big attraction - extremely easy to learn -- no dice -- and more strategy than initially meets the eye.

Great gateway/family game. Can be taught in a few minutes, and almost everyone I've ever played it with enjoys it. While many people complain that luck plays a large role in the game, from my experience the better players almost always win, sometimes in dramatic fashion. It can be played very cutthroat by experienced gamers, or enjoyed on a lower level by casual gamers.

USA is by far the best map, as it is the only one with enough long routes to make finishing quickly and scoring lots of points from non ticket sources a viable option. Blocking is also an important aspect to this map.

I now understand why this game is so popular.  It is quick to learn with simple rules and mechanics.  But there are abundant strategy choices which should prevent a feeling of sameness creeping in after only a few plays.

Although there is an element of luck when drawing cards, the opportunity to choose specific cards from a limited display removes some of the randomness, making it a true strategy game.

Like the big board, nice trains, etc. Marred by the fact that my wife doesn't really like it - I think the worst thing for her is the frustration when someone blocks off a long route that you've nearly completed - suspect that the stations in TTR:E would help here.

I consider this a classic.  If someone hates games, they will probably like this.  The only people I've met who hate this are avid gamers.  (I'm sure it's similar to my Splendor/Takenono thing.)

Ticket to Ride is my "everybody" game.  Maybe that's because of nostalgia for it being one of my earlier intros.

Great fun, easy to learn but hard to dominate when played against other good players. I felt that stations and other extras muddied the game which was strong because of it's simplicity!

TTR is a nice route building game, but at the end of the day, I prefer Power Grid or Crayon Rails for network building and find Airlines Europe (Union Pacific) more to my tastes for this format.

RATING: 9
It's definitely very fun, though it's lost some of its novelty after multiple plays.  Everyone seems to enjoy it and it's never the exact same game twice.  I like the components, though the cards are a little too small to handle.  

Update (7/2014) - in reviewing my ratings I noticed that I unjustly had this at a 7. It is a wonderful game, my favorite map. Those that think that this is a luck game are simply wrong. In fact, I often hesitate to introduce this to new game players because they would lose so badly. With all experienced players, Ticket to Ride always guarantees a good time. The only thing keeping me from putting this at a 10 is the need to buy the 1910 expansion for full size cards. The cards included in this game are a travesty.

Nice game for a non-gamer. I can see why it's easy and appealing. However, I feel that this game is a bit [b]too simple[/b]. Feels like a drawn-out Carcassonne. It has the same mechanics of indirect attacks like a good Eurogame. Perhaps there is more uncertainty in a large player game.Maybe this game is the recommended gateway game compared to Carcassonne because Carcassonne has the farmer element. It's hard for people to grasp that, where as Ticket to Ride's concepts are all [b]easily comprehended[/b].

RATING: 6
The game was definitely easy to learn and had some tense moments, but I didn't like the playing system. There were too few options to choose from during each turn. If you are thinking of getting it, then I suggest you read the rules before buying the game. [UPDATED] Giving it a slight bump because all my non-gamer friends loved it.

Thankfully, we had lots of fun with this game with different families. I like building the railroads and also like the cards, but not an overly interesting game. You can end up having cards you do not need and waiting a long time for cards you need.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.7
A big hit in my circle. Fantastic thematically, great fun to play. turns are short so its always quick to come back to you so not too much down time. trying to create intricate routes to connect cities, and gambling on taking more mission cards as the game goes on are all fun mechanics. Super fun any everyone is always happy to play when we have a group, even the non gamers. Fun saving up cards of different colors and then building that one big track. Not too much strategic depth to be found, but for a game to relax and play with friends its a sure success.  

Cons:
-Can sometimes feel really bad if you get blocked from completing a big route and then you know you have lost the game but have to continue to play anyway. Has the potential for some really nasty plays made just to screw people over which leaves a sour taste. And losing a 21 point mission isnt just missing out on 21 points, its also getting -21 so its a 42 point swing which will single handedly decide a game. Many games decided in one turn/move.

A bit more strategy than TransAmerica, but also a bit more luck. I enjoyed the first game I played, but have found repeated plays to be a bit tedious. To me it seems like it takes longer to play than it's depth warrants. I prefer Stephenson's Rocket on the deeper side and TransAmerica on the lighter side. Perhaps that is why TtR is so popular, it falls right between a very light game and a more medium weight game.

Awesome game that is great for beginners just getting into more complex board games. This is a favorite at my house and I usually won't turn down a game when it's suggested. Works great as a two player game as well as with more plays (just note that the game can get really long if you have a lot of people playing). The train theme is very interesting and the little train figures are modelled well (and they give you a few extras in case you lose some!). I like how the cards are miniature so they don't take up as much room on the table (however, you still need a pretty big area to play this game properly). The only annoyance is that it's kind of annoying to be the person viewing the map from above (i.e. backwards, or to the south), as you're looking at everything upside-down.

Ticket to Ride is one of the first games that I have played several times a row and I do like this a lot. What I can say is that it's almost compulsory to get the USA 1910 expansion as it gives everyone those bigger cards that are just so much easier to handle (with also more tickets and other stuff). So you should definitely try out Ticket to Ride if you haven't already.
Also did I mention that it has trains!!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Nice and quite fast. There's a high possibility of positive stress to be found in the endgame when you need to draw some crucial card to win a huge amount of points. It's, however, a little sad that the early game is just about drawing more and more cards because putting wagons on the board too early offers your opponents quite an easy chance to screw your game. Scoring system also benefits longer tracks too much which also encourages drawing cards early. With new maps and mechanical additions the basic TtR is turning more and more into a mere platform, for better, newer stuff. Also, I consider the original US map to be one of the weaker ones and most of my plays come on expansion maps.

I like how this simple blend of mechanisms leads to such a fulfilling experience. Nothing particularly original, no outstanding mechanism, just a solid product, in the "greater than the sum of its parts" category. I also love the multiple maps, which all lead to a similar, but different enough games that I don't mind playing it often: without them, the game would get repetitive quickly.

I initially played this w/ a larger group when I first moved to Portland and really enjoyed it.  Then I discovered the wild world of gaming and forgot about this because I thought it was simplistic.  Now I've come back to it and appreciate it for what it is.  There is definitely a big component of luck with the card draw but the decision of where and when to play your trains can feel very strategic and I find myself in anxious anticipation of everyone's moves.  I have yet to play using the 1910 expansion (outside of just using the larger cards) nor any other expansions and am really looking forward to getting plays of this in again.  This will also play well with newbies/family which gives it an extra plus.

Most games don't give you much of a clue as to any overarching strategy - your first couple plays might solely consist of fumbling through, trying different things out and seeing what works.  TTR obviates this through the destination tickets - right off the bat you have a few long term goals, and you can see each turn how much progress you have made toward them.  This makes things a lot easier for new players, and also leads to a nice balance between strategy and tactics.  

And yet... the more games I add to my collection, the less enthusiasm I have to get this one to the table.  A victim of its own success perhaps?

RATING: 5
fast play, a little light on strategy, moderate player interaction.  A winner but maybe not an every day kind of game for me.  Lighter than I expected.

Edit: after playing the card game I could never come back to this.

I see the appeal, it just isn't fun for me.

Enjoyable, simple game. This is one of the only games that miraculously kept my Dad's interest. Just like Candy Land, TtR is a modern classic. ;)

Update: Played this game with my sister and brother-in-law. Although they requested a few rematches, my sister's final verdict was not all that positive: "This game is entertaining, but not fun." I guess you can't please everyone. The funny thing is that she bought the game a few weeks later.

This has to be the #1 series of train games right now.  Games like Railroad Tycoon and Age of Steam may have more depth and realism, but the ballance of speed and ingenuity of this series beats that out in my book.  The only lack for me is modularity, but that is slowly being solved by new versions.

Based on 25+ plays.  The game is well-loved by my friends.  Like many, though, I'm a bit suspicious about the balance of the tickets and the viability of certain strategies. While I'll still play the game on occassion, I'd always prefer one of its sequels to the original.

Perfect game for introducing to non-gamers and casual gamers alike.  Everyone we've taught this one to has thoroughly enjoyed it.  Our 9-year-old son likes it too, although it runs a bit long for his short attention span.  We just let him run around between his turns. :)

Gateway game, after some plays I don't really want to play it anymore, at least this version of Ticket to Ride.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Very well-designed game. Every turn you decide between only three things, but there is a lot of weight behind those decisions. Turns move quickly and the game is flexible in that if someone cuts off your original route, you can respond in a number of ways to better your situation. Maybe you'll find a different path. If you can't do that, maybe you'll abandon that ticket and go for the longest single route on the board just for the points, or maybe you'll take a chance and draw more tickets... There's a lot of hidden press-your-luck decisions in this game. It's always fun.

My version is the 2007 version, but it says, "Over 1.1 million games sold" on the box.  Go figure.  I think they left off an option.  Regardless, this is a great game that gets tons of play in most groups I know.  It is easy enough to be a family game, but is fun for everyone.  Another Monopoly-killer.  They need to ditch the tiny cards, though.

Great game, works equally well with 2 players or a large group. (With 2 players, the double routes can only be used once so that evens out game play). Very replayable.

This is probably the fourth modern board game I ever played and it's so fun. I especially like the set collection and route building mechanisms. Also, let's be real, it's really great being able to block other people's routes! Last note, 
the 1910 expansion is a must.

I love this game. Easy to learn, easy to teach and the strategy "lightbulbs" go off in the new player's head within the first couple of rounds of a game. Highly recommend! *Negatives* are the cards are too small, and I would have liked to see DoW use the rubber they used for bits in Memoir 44 rather than the hard plastic they used. If the table or board gets bumped the cars move on the board.

The more I play the better this gets.  Strategies and interaction become more competitive.  The quality of the board and pieces are a big plus.  The cards are a touch too small for an adult male, but a very minor complaint in the face of such a fun game.

I will play this anytime my parents are in town and willing to play.  Oddly enough, I don't like playing it with my more hard core gamer fans.

Even so, there's no reason this doesn't deserve a 10 both based on desire to play in certain situations and just pure quality of game design.

It's just not a very good game.

If the best game you've ever played is Clue or Monopoly, then, sure, you might enjoy it.  A lot.

But when you compare it to all the great board games out there, it doesn't hold up whatsoever.

If you're an extremely casual gamer and enjoy very light games such as Settlers of Catan, I'd say go for it. Otherwise, skip it and buy a real game.

It's a good game, just too simple for anyone really serious about gaming.  Great for families.

Edit, Dec 2011:  It's better than it first seems.  I'm having a lot of fun with it.  Also this is just as good as any other version of the game if you ask me, overall.

Edit, Feb 2015:  Once you know it's optimal to just hoard cards for the first 10 or so turns the game really falls apart. Plus it's really random.

Not entirely convinced by this. There's a lot of luck as to whether your routes overlap with anyone else's, which can leave one player with enough room for an easier win. Presumably plays very differently depending on players' attitudes to offensive-play sabotage, though.

RATING: 8
Wonderfully fun and yet as simple as can be.  A terrific game to help casual gamers break free from their Monopoly chains.  I've given away two copies -- and I'll probably purchase ten more before something better comes along.  I'd never choose this to play with "real" gamers (!) but it's perfect for the casual set.  We often add two cards to each draw (or stop with two voluntary locomotives), otherwise it drags on too long.

Unbearable tension, gut-wrenching decisions, risk and reward, but all based on very simple rules.  This is pretty much my favorite game, though I had to drop it to 9.5 to make room for Europe to be a 10.

If I'm going somewhere with non-gamers and can bring just one game along to show to them, this is the one I'll grab every time.

Favorite way to play it is the "mega game" with ALL the tickets and bonuses from the 1910 expansion.

~30 plays F2F plus uncountable hundreds on xbox, PC, on-line...

RATING: 3
Also one of the first non-Monopoly-type games I played and even at the time I was not a fan. You are basically doing one thing the entire time and to me, there was not much variability to the game as a whole. You draw, you build, and that's it. I can see how this is a good gateway game as well, but it's not for me. Would likely not play it again.

Finally Moon dumbed his train games down enough for the average American.

This is probably the first time you've ever read this, but TtR is a great "gateway" game. It's easy enough for children and nongamers to pick up on quickly, but has enough theme and strategy involved to introduce them to concepts of heavier games. Plus, the best reason it's a great gateway game is just because it is really fun.  As far as I'm concerned, TtR is an absolute must-own, especially if you ever try to introduce new people to our beloved hobby.

This is the best gateway game in my collection and I don't think it will ever be changed. Everybody loves trains and routes. The 10th anniversary edition I have makes the game more attractive and fun. I haven't met a newbie dislike this game. However, this game becomes little bit childish and dry for regular board gamers but I'm still happy to play this whenever there is a demand.

A simple gateway family route-building game. Great components, as usual, from Days of Wonder. The game is fun enough, but the base game is lacking. In my opinion, it is only really worth playing if you also have the 1910 expansion.

There certainly is a sense of increasing tension as the game progresses, but luck plays too large a factor in the outcome. I suppose this is normal for gateway games, but still I wish there was some way to mitigate the luck of the draw.

[b]My thoughts[/b]: I enjoy the race aspects of this game immensely, trying to fill your route before the other players and trying not to stretch yourself too thin.  Seems almost similar to Elfenland in that race regard, idk.  I wouldn't ever turn down a game of this, simple and fun and easy to teach and learn.

A great game for non-gamers, or for family/casual play. Not enough control to make a really good two player game. It sounds like the 1910 expansion makes for a better game. Sometimes I just get small destination cards and without at least one long track, it is very hard to win!
It is also very easy to be mean in this game. With two players it is pretty easy to be nice and stay out of each other's way if you want. I really enjoy this game, but don't think that players have enough control to make it a really good gamer's game.

This game for me never gets tiring it always seems fresh. It's like and not like elfenland, there are  simalarities and differences and here they are,  in both games you travel to cites and collect points,  and the differnce os in ticket to ride you get "destination cards" which if you travel from A to point B while building track (or using some of your old track) you earn a certain amount of points And in elfenland you get animal cards are boats that each one has different amount ofmovement they can move in each distinct area. I would recommend it to people  who are already fans of Alan R. Moon  are interested in it ( which should be everyone or your missing  out on fantastic game!

It seems that you can’t go wrong with a Ticket to Ride board game. I’ve yet to find a person who doesn’t enjoy them and I've played them with nephews, nieces, in-laws, parents, friends, gamers, and non-gamers. Plus I still get a kick out of them after many plays. For all of the games in the series the rules are easy to learn, turns go quickly, and the basic strategy is apparent but the competition for links and the risk of getting blocked keeps things interesting for everyone.

This version is a great starting point. This, the first in the series, is the core system with no extra rules making it the quickest one to comprehend and teach while still being just as compelling as the other games. 

One drawback of this version is the tiny cards. This can be easily remedied by picking up the USA 1910 expansion which is highly recommended since it replaces all of the cards with larger format versions and also includes many extra optional destination tickets, an extra reward goal (the ’Globetrotter’ bonus for completing the most tickets) all of which work together to make a great game even better without adding complexity.

This map is a lot more cutthroat than some of the other TTR maps, but one that I still enjoy. The same old game is here, minus the bells and whistles of the Europe, Switzerland, and Asia maps. That being said, the formula still works. Excellent family game.

The quintessential gateway game that is easy to learn and enjoyed by all who have played it with me. This is the US map which should be played with the 1910 expansion.

RATING: 8
Extremely easy to teach. Whenever I want to introduce the archetypical "non-gamer" to the hobby, chances are I'll start with this one. Turns moves fast and a full game can be finished within an hour, even with total newbies.

The amount of conflict can be adjusted by the players, so it has the potential of offering two different experiences without throwing balance out of the window, which is nice. Want a friendly game where each player tries to mind their own business, yet competing with others when they have similar objectives? You can have that. Or maybe you prefer a super cutthroat game where players are constantly blocking each other? That's possible too.

Funny enough, this is the opposite of Settlers in terms of luck impact: while luck can have a tremendous impact in determining the winner, its mechanisms give the illusion of a larger degree of control.

Great game to introduce new gamers to.  Everyone I've played it with has loved it.  It's simple enough to grasp quickly, but has enough strategy to keep it from getting boring.  I find 3p to be the most stressful, as the map gets crowded, but the double routes are blocked.  It's only not a 10 because I suspect I would eventually enjoy the 1910 expansion more, and really look forward to getting Nordic Countries for 2-3p.  But that will have to wait.

A bit too straightforward for my tastes - I sometimes feel like I'm losing IQ when playing this game, due to its extreme simplicity. In addition, there aren't enough opportunities for player interaction in this base version. However, many of my friends enjoy this game, and it's quick enough that I'll never object to playing it. In my opinion, this is a great game for young families, and has diminishing returns as the average player age increases.

I played it many times before I has been logged on BGG. Great game for "entry lelvel". If you want to invite someone for first board game then TTR is great for that - it looks great, easy rules and light play are great argumments. Furthermore i like to occasionally play with friends, when we dont want something harder.

This game seems to be regarded highly by many people and rightfully so. The game is fun for non gamers and gamers alike and I was very happy to receive it as a birthday present in 2016. The game scales well with different player counts and is equally fun with any numer of players. That I'm not particularly interested in the train theme, does not matter, because it fits the game well.

Great family game.  If playing with 2 I strongly recommend my TTR Ghost Train variant.  Check the variants forums for it.  It makes a 2-player game much more enjoyable IMO.

After 60+ plays I still really enjoy this. It can suffer from randomness sometimes and that's frustrating but I perceive the randomness to also be a sort of wager component. Usually you aren't stretched to the end to finish tickets unless you set yourself up for that. I also really like how you can play casually and cutthroat.

This is my favorite map due to its elegance.

The game is very easy to learn, and the game can grow tense as more and more routes disappear.  There is a good amount of variety from game to game, though luck does seem to influence the outcome.

After repeated plays, I've found myself less enthusiastic about the game, even with suggested optional rules for balancing the game (e.g., initial ticket distribution).  The set collecting isn't very exciting.

Ticket to Ride / Zug um Zug is a fantastic - and light - railroad game. AND look at those components: Days of Wonders have made an outstanding beautiful game!
The game itself is simple and works like a toilet in train: Easy enough for the kids or no-gamers but still offers enough excitement for the real-gamers. Okay, there is quite a lot of card luck in this game, but I've seen, that veterans are in a better positions. This game is one of the best SdJ winner ever! I've played this one over 1000 games so far. If you love TtR, but wants some variations, just get the 1910 -expansion; it's better than those Europe/Scandinavion/Switzerland -editions.

RATING: 6
Based on the North American map, Ticket to Ride is the original. (Many board gamers erroneously call this game's map, the US map, but the game board does include Canadian cities, so they are only partially correct.) Although TtR does lack some of the more interesting features of its newer cousins (a la 'Ticket to Ride Europe' and 'Ticket to Ride Märklin Edition'), it is still a fun game to play. Be forewarned that luck is required (because of the card and ticket draws). However, the game plays quickly since there are only three possible actions to choose from during any particular turn. Some tactical play is possible (by blocking your opponent's key routes), but only if you have protected your own destination routes. All-in-all it's a good game to try out and play, if you've never done so before. If you are thinking of permanently adding one of the TtR games to your collection, one of the newer games in this series might be a better choice. {7}

I enjoy Ticket to Ride. I'm not madly in love with it. In fact I like the app more than the actual board game, mostly because dealing with the trains and the scoring is so fiddly. The original is also not my favorite. It favors those who snag the 6-train routes. Too many tickets overlap, which encourages ticket-fishing. And it has too many choke points (the optimal number would be zero). 

Furthermore, I still hate that they sell this and Europe without the expansion decks. The expansion decks are far too expensive for what you are getting. Considering both this and Europe now routinely sell for under $40, they need to be done with the expansions and sell Deluxe versions of both.

This game is the reference game that should win the award for HIGHEST INFORMATION OVEFLOW. First you must think of which connection you can do to connect your cities. Second, you must look out which colors you need to connect them. Third you must plan how are you going to pick up cards and manage your hand to place up track. At this point, there is enough informatin to manage. 

But normally, you should also be trying to expect where your oppoenent is trying to move. To do this You should watch the cards drawn and played by other players. And this should also influence the cards you are going to draw and play because you want to prevent other player from getting the right card or connecting the right city. 

Look, I am NOT a computer, I cannot keep track of that much information while playing.  So it is almost a solo multiplayer game, you do what you have to do and the game ends. Then you win or lose without knowing why.

RATING: 8
An excellent game with only a slight superficial resemblance (in appearance) to Union Pacific, also designed by Mr. Moon.  T2R has universal appeal to the casual/non-gamer crowd and gamer fans alike, so it makes a great "gateway" game to introduce boardgaming to newbies.  The game's central challenges are card-set collections and tactical board strategy by laying train links.  It's nerve-wracking from turn to turn, in a delightful way, watching to see if others lay track where you want your tracks to be, or taking the train cards you covet.  The production quality is outstanding (as you come to expect from Days of Wonder).

Fairly enjoyable, particularly when too tired to play something more complex.  As has often been stated, a good game to introduce to non-gamers.  That "longest route" card is absolutely pointless, however...though perhaps not as much so as the scoring card, which just reprints information already on the board.

I used to really like this game but overplayed it and have come to prefer heavier games.  Its a solid family game and intro game for new gamers.  It gained new life for me recently with the 1910 expansion as it provides much more tighter and competitive play for routes.

Also, I recently played the homemade Africa version.  It is one gigantic board and provides some interesting gameplay - is definitely composed of longer tracks and longer tickets.

I liked this on my first play, back when I was new to this board game thing, but time and repeated plays have knocked it from its generous perch of a "7" rating. And it hit every branch.

I would almost go so far as to say this is the "illusion of a game".  You're basically playing an open-draw variant of rummy.  Scoring happens by placing trains on a map of the States, but this is where the game falls apart.  

You're secretly trying to connect certain cities to fulfill "Destination Tickets", but the winner is almost always decided by whomever happens to draw the Destination Tickets that work best together.  If you've got "Chicago - Boston" and also "New York - Santa Fe", all you've got to do is tack a few extra routes  to either end of the smaller one and you've got an extra 10 points free and clear.  Stupid.

Also, blocking other people is a negligible strategy, and I almost never saw it happen.  Sure, if you've got a Destination Ticket that directly competes with another person's, both of you are screwed.  As for claiming routes to purposely block someone else's path, are you really gonna waste the cards and a turn just to slow someone else down?  You're likely hurting yourself as much as her.

Lastly, the worst thing I can say about the game is that the best strategy I ever played with was to completely ignore the Destinations and just claim the longest routes on the board.  Completely contrary to the theme and spirit of the game, and so we arrive back at TtR's real predecessor:  RUMMY.

The only nice things I can say about this are (a) at least it's simple to teach and (b) the train theme is fun.  It's a shame they are selling so many of these, though, because all it's likely to do is make people think these "designer games" are almost as bad as Monopoly.

RATING: 8
Simple to learn. Easy to play. A great gateway game which has been well received by friends. I especially like the opportunity to play online through the excellent Days of Wonder site.

"Unnecessarily complicated. There are no dice or "action" modes. Players simply draw cards and try to complete their color-coded routes by using all or almost all of their 45 train-car pieces that mark the routes and hope that they aren’t blocked because an opponent has claimed that route. The scoring system is arcane and involves adding points as you progress on your routes. Of course, you may have to subtract points at the game’s merciful end if you are left with destination cards, each of which has an assigned point value. This also plays more like a card game than a board game.

What we learned: Ticket to Ride has nothing to do with the Beatles. There are several versions of the game, among them Ticket to Ride: Nordic Countries, and this was once named the German "Game of the Year," which we found fairly astounding."

This is the first board game that I played. Easy to pick up, easy to play, setup is easy as can be, and it is fun. That being said I hate the SIZE of the cards (1910 expansion and $15 later the cards are bearable.). Also it's too easy to cheat and that just isn't fun. (players grabbed route cards and checked them under the table) My other complaint is that it's too easy and too predictable. This game ushered in Settlers of Catan for us, and for that it gets a solid "7". Grade: C. For families, children, and first players: A.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This game is very tense and exciting, and the more players there are, the harder it is to keep a balance between building the links you need versus accumulating the cards you want.

I've only ever played with the 1910 cards.

A great, simple game. I see that it really is a good fast gateway game, but it just isn't that good for me. I like how it can be so different even though you only get one really static map, but after 4 plays I feel that is just one of those Euros that you can play 10-12 times and they become a useless lump in your collection unless you buy more expansions. 

Edit: I do like the game, and it shows that 1910 was much needed, but sometimes I feel like at half of the game, it becomes pointless if you are not playing with really competitive people. "You know you're gonna win, so, c'mon, let's get this over with!!"

Love Ticket to Ride! It doesn't take too long to learn how to play this game, yet there's some strategy to it. A great family game for sure! I think Ticket to Ride Europe is better than Ticket to Ride America as there is more clustering around certain areas and more competition for the same routes. I think the whole layout is more enjoyable and like the added element of the stations which add more strategy and help to alleviate the lack of alternate routes.

It's a good game, but too much of it requires overthinking for a boardgame. The best thing was when this was made into a mobile app that applied the rules for what goes where. I love the game itself just not as much as a tabletop game.

First plays of this were luke-warm. The game played a bit slow.

Since then two improvements. First, 1910 makes the cards much more manageable. Second, we stopped scoring train lengths during the game. This speeds things up and we tended to forget to do it anyway.

Game is a 8, but an 9 with the [b]1910[/b] expansion.

I enjoyed this game a lot when I used it as an introductory game for non-gamers. It went over very well.  Earns its "gateway game" status.  I'll refrain from rating it until I have a few more plays under my belt, but I'm guessing it will  be an 8 or 9.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This was not as fun as the Europe map for us.  Whoever gets the long tickets usually also gets the long routes out West, which usually results in the win.  Can be a little too cutthroat for casual play as well.  The Europe map just looks more exotic and exciting to us---who wants to just travel around the boring USA?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Most of my friends enjoy this one more than I do. Perhaps I haven't caught on to the competitive aspect of the game yet, but it seems we mostly focus entirely on our own tickets and ignore everyone else unless there is obvious overlap threatening, in which case it's just the first person to randomly draw enough cards (which does lead to some tense moments at least). Not a wide enough variety of meaningful choices on one's turn, IMO.

Its progeny may have become more sophisticated but it is obvious that this still remains a powerful game.  The game packs a real punch and if you let your guard down towards the end you may be dealt a knockout blow.

I preter TTRE, with its fine-tuning, as the emphasis on hoarding cards is too much in this game but I appreciate the greater competition for lines and the increased tension in completing your routes is greater as you race headfirst towards the end.  A game which is relatively raw but wonderfully so.

I just can't get into this game. At all. I want to like it, but choices are limited, luck can make or break a route, memorizing the routes is a huge advantage but not one that's satisfying or easily equalized, and strategically blocking routes is rough on non-gamers. It's not meaty enough to be a good gamer game, and isn't as good as Settlers of Carcassonne as a gateway game.

no dice, lots of trains. this game isn't like most "train" games where you manage how the trains function - this is about accumulating cards of the right type to enable you to build a route to put your trains on and gain victory points for those routes. you can also gain addition points by connecting cities. every game is different; even though the map never changes - the players and their approaches to the game are.

My wife & I have played this game so much we have adapted our strategy in playing many times over & know the different strategies we need when the number of players or board changes. A wonderful game we were introduced to by some friend and finally were given at Christmas 2014. We like playing this 2,3,4 & 5 player. game competitiveness depends on who you play. The luck of the tickets can make or break a win, but we have found some cool ways to incorporate the north to south routes together, hopefully without running out of trains.

My very first board game, which I love.  It's a game I really enjoy playing, but it gets taken over by all the other ones that are coming out or that I've been introduced.  

It creates fabulous tension, whether it's with two players or more.  It's nice to see how people work their destinations and see the relief come across their faces as they complete their destinations - or think that they have, when in actual fact they haven't!!  

It's definitely worth playing just to see reactions, plus it's a very pretty game.

One of the perennial questions that people ask once they get deep into the board gaming hobby is "what's a good game to play with non-gamers?" with non-gamers including people who play the odd hand of Cribbage or game of Yahtzee once or twice a month. Right now, my best generic answer is Ticket to Ride.

Among Ticket to Ride's virtues, I would count the way it is built from a collection of straightforward mechanics (Carcassonne suffers from the opacity of farmers) that revolve around the fundamental act of building a network of connections on the map; turns go quickly, and many plays are obvious or straightforward – so not too stressful – but you have an underlying plan that keeps them meaningful; meaningful but non-malicious interaction (yes, deliberate blocking is possible, but you can avoid it without being obvious about it, a la the Robber in Settlers of Catan) and a nice sense of narrative produced organically by the fulfillment of tickets and how decisions feel different as the board fills up.

Not everything is sunshine and roses, of course. Arguably, the game would be better if it could keep the narrative arc while shaving fifteen minutes off the play time. For gamers, at least, I think you can argue that the game goes on a bit when it clocks in at 45 minutes. While the luck of the ticket draw is mitigated, it's not trivial, and I'm not sure the push your luck element of drawing more tickets evens it out. Because of the longest route bonus, a collection of tickets that naturally trace out a long route have a distinct advantage over a collection that are easier to fulfill when you branch your network.

I've only played one of the expansions (Switzerland) and that only once so far, so I'm not prepared to pontificate on that topic. Instead, I would say the general guidelines for good extensions would be: keep new systems strongly attached to TtR's network-building heart; extra randomness is deliberately push your luck, not getting randomly hosed with little option and don't make the game noticeably longer.

Not the second coming of Princes of Florence, but well-crafted light fun.

If you didn't already know, Ticket to Ride is a light network building game that serves great as a gateway for new gamers. I wish hoarding train cards until you laid them all down in one fell swoop wasn't as good as it was (aside for the occasional choke point route), but that seems to be the most solid strategy in this game.

EDIT: I lowered my rating because I realized stockpiling cards before splurging in large bursts or just making aimless long connections can be quite good, and that really abstracts the theme of the game, focusing more on the set collection rummy part rather than the route building that implements up the train theme.

Australia: Fantastic! Great with any number of players, but gets cramped easily since there are only so many ways around. Funny almost, since it isn't entirely apparent at first glance that this map will be cramped. This pnp board has the most fantastic new mechanism yet seen in any TTR game: the switches.

This is hands down the most overrated game. People taut it as a great gateway game, but I think this would have discouraged me from gaming because there’s just so little to it. I hate games where there is always an obvious play. I could maybe enjoy this if there were points to be gained from preventing other people from completing routes somehow? But I’ve won every game I’ve played because there is just always an obvious decision. I played on my iPad for a little while, and I could tell from my initial destination draws roughly what my score would be and whether or not I would win. If you know the outcome before you start based on random luck, why even play?

This game gets better the more you play.  Playing it online made me appreciate the subtle tension in the game.  Sometimes it is a little dry for me, but with the right group (mainly, a fast-playing one) this game shines.

The main tension is simple really.  It comes in deciding whether to take more cards or spend the cards you have to grab routes.  If you draw too many cards you might lose a key route, but if you move too fast to grab a route you'll find it hard to grab the longer, more valuable routes.  It's a simple game with simple decisions, but these simple decisions make for some interesting and challenging decisions.  The game's challenging simplicity makes it a classic.

Ticket to ride is a fun game that is very easy to explain.  Its light, but I think it has enough challenge to keep interested a person who prefers heavier games.  Another gateway game, Settlers is more interesting, but takes a little longer to get through the rules.

RATING: 8
A staple of my game group, partly because I don't have that many multi-player, big box board games.  Still, very popular and easier to teach than Settlers or any of my other games.  I think the reason its such a great gateway game is due to the intuitive nature of laying down colored cars to claim routes.  Such a simple, easily visualised goal, but the possibility of being thwarted by other players is equally easily visualised. *UPDATE 4/16/06*  Dropped a rating point.  I don't find myself wanting to play this lately, but it's still a fun game.  The kids have really grown to love it>

Fun family game.  This game works very well in a mixed group.  Not too deep, and easy for a wide audience to learn and enjoy.  Very simple.  But it is somewhat fun (for a while) trying to figure out how to decide the optimal time to stop drawing and start laying track.  Possibly the most difficult decisions is whether or not, and when, to draw additional tickets.  A bit "samey" after a while due to its lack of strategic depth.

With "USA 1910" card expansion.

A really great game.  1st play was with only 2 people but still had a good time learning and playing.  The best thing about this game is the lack of real downtime.

RATING: 7
Classic, rummy style train game where you collect color sets to setup routes and score points.  Connect a couple of cities and you will score more points at the end of the game.  But if you do not finish the route, you go back that number of points.  

The base game can be a little mean in that you can cutoff players before they complete their routes.  

After many plays, there is an optimal set of East-West routes you can build which can make you very hard to beat.  But still a great family and gateway game. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A great lightweight draw and set-collecting game.  It really is brilliant in its simplicity.  It even has a little opportunity for player interaction by blocking routes.  Days of Wonder has a great site to play this by web.  Playing this online, however, has reduced my patience for playing face-to-face.

Ticket to Ride captures that elusive 'fun' element where the game is greater than the sum of it's parts.  It's a wonderful network building/card collection game with quick, straight-forward gameplay.

Incredible gateway game, if not the very best currently out there.  Approachable, with nice components (minus the replaceable mini-cards) and relatively quick play.  Sold in favor of TTR:  Nordic Countries after my wife and I found that we were generally only playing it 2-player and needed a more competitive board.  Will likely pick up big brother TTR:  Europe when we find the need for a 4+ player mechanic, thanks to its slightly heavier weight, but this original comes highly recommended for anyone just getting into or trying to get others into modern board gaming.

The Monopoly of the modern era. The only thing I hate about it is the amount of downtime there is between turns (you don't really do anything when it isn't your turn), particularly in a 5 player game. It's still one of the best family games out there and I rarely turn it down.

Picked up 2006 (Christmas 2005)

This is probably the biggest game let-down I've ever had.

Simple to teach and easy to learn, so it does live up to its reputation as a great gateway game, but the lack of player interaction is a big dissapointment. Also, the game tension didn't feel very strong to us so we didn't feel like we accomplished anything after the game was over. Best with 5 players but even then we all found it to be pretty weak.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Fun entry level game that is easy to learn.  Each turn goes quickly with one of three simple options for each player, and there is opportunity to go big with risk-taking.  It is not a game with much depth, but is entertaining for a mixed-crowd or family.  Nice tension in the game while competing to claim routes,

The map and parts look nice - the game visually appealing with the different colored train routes.  The cards also have great art and nice quality.

The kids liked it right away but fun for adults too.

I rate the game higher with a higher number of players in which there is more tension in deciding where and when to build a track.

I was totally obsessed with this game when I first played it.  After about 20+ plays though, the magic has kind of worn off.

After 3 plays, not as excited as I thought I'd be. Midway through the first play the long route strategy became obvious to all of us. Perhaps there's a way around that, but right now it seems near-unstoppable. 

12/25: one play of this today convinced me to lower from 8 to 7. It's not the long-route strategy that annoys me. It's the solo feeling it gives. There is very little interaction, because screwing with others ALWAYS will hurt YOU more in the end, so you don't bother screwing with others. The decisions (lay down track now? or draw and lay down more track another turn?) *feel* important but now I see it matters very very little, and therefore is a pseudo-decision, which kinda pisses me off. Maaaaaybe I was spoiled this evening by playing a few games of Ingenious first, whose strategies began unfurling their petals like a flower. TtR felt incredibly flat in comparison.

3-1-08: Lowering to 6. I don't hate it, I guess.

I put off buying or playing this game for a few years because it looked like something I'd have played with my kids (except they were too old when I found it). I kept reading how grownups were playing, but the look still put me off. When out of town (non-gamer) relatives came in for a visit, we finally picked this up. We were amazed at how much fun it was and it remains a go-to favorite years later.

I only have the base game listed here because I consider TTR to be one game, with several variations. We own all of the boards and all of the maps now, and we even have the "First Journey" game for our grandson. We got rid of the card version because it was horrible. We never dared buy the dice version because the card version sucked so much.

Rules to TTR can be learned quickly and easily, by anyone from an 80 year old great grandma to a pre-teen. (Don't start with Rails and Sails or the England map.) The underlying strategy however, is another story. Turns move quickly, because you can only do one thing during your turn and you usually know what you want to do by the time your turn rolls around, except Dave.

This game is truly fun to play. Everyone we've ever taught to play LOVES the game and most people end up buying their own copy. I recommend the 1910 expansion because the cards are bigger and I'm old and blind. If you play a lot, I'd recommend some of the extra maps. Alvin & Dexter make for an interesting variant too.

Overall, this is probably the most played game in our collection.


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Fun game. I like it more with 3 people than 2, because there is more competition of the railroads. This game is great, but it can get boring if you play it too many times in a row. There is luck involved, so you may get really good cards or really bad ones. But still, great game that works well!

but just doesn't work for me, ether things go well or they don't. just doesn't seem as in depth as it should be (I've gave it plenty of shots as my family loves it)

europe version steps it up and I liked it MUCH better even though it only added 2 rules or so

Added to my collection in 2007. First played in September 2009.

I have only played one game so far, so these are initial observations. It was easy to learn and fun but I think we played too nice with one another and didn't try to frustrate each others plans, reducing the challenge.

Initial rating Sept 2009: 6.

Updated rating December 2010: 7

Played a second game with non gaming family. Really easy to teach, everyone enjoyed the game. Last game played in 2010.

If it were not for bad luck I would not have any luck at all. Unfortunately luck has little to with this game. I do not hate this game but I sure do not have any love for it either. When I play this I run into too many bad decisions and or I wait too long to make a move. However that is what makes this game one of my wife's favorite. Which means I have to play it. In the light of things, I did make a someone get his lowest score ever. I am very proud of that and only because I bought most of the 6 cart lines. It was a fun night for me, and I still did not win.

If you've had this game for a while and it hasn't seen the table in a while, freshen it up with the 1910 expansion... lots of fun.

A modern classic.  I've used this to introduce many to the hobby.  Plenty of fun for people of all ages, and with the 1910 expansion throwing in more routes, it has greater replayability.

I have played this game more than a few times now, and I do not see what all the hype is about. I think it is good, but not great. The game itself is very nice to look at and all the bitz are well made, but for me the play lacks excitement. There is not a lot of player interaction and very little you can do if you cant draw the color card you need.  Also it seems that if you can draw one of the coast to coast destination cards at the start of the game that you have a huge advantage.

I have played this with all sorts of non-gamers and they always run out and buy a copy for themselves.

Although it is a quick game to pick up and a relatively strategic one, this is not a game I would play excessively. Its great as a gateway game, but it really falls short of a spectacular game. The player interaction is minimal,and entirely composed of "who took my route/train first" plays, and leads to the game sometimes feeling like multiplayer solitaire. I've heard expansions help in that regard, but in my opinion, this game gets dry fast.

Honestly, I didn't think I would enjoy this game based on what I had read. Just seemed too tame and boring. Boy was I wrong.

While it is certainly not a deep game, it has enough light strategy going on to hold a players interest. It's universal appeal is a big upside here as it makes it easy to teach new players and get them interested in the game...and it can and will hit the table very often.

Any game I can teach to my parents, wife, and friends and that they actually request playing is certainly a win in my eyes.

Make routes, get points, block opponents, and make sure everything is well timed. A very enjoyable game.

Components are excellent too!

RATING: 10
The perfect game system with which to introduce new players to the Euro-style game, and it has enough elegant depth to keep me playing. I love the subtle interaction between the drive to complete your own tickets, and the desire to block others. But why are they "tickets"? In my mind this is a game about building railways, not completing journeys.

Excelent game to play with the family. It is pretty light and luck based, but IMHO well balanced, and most important if you are planning to play with your non-gamer family, easy on rules and attractive, I've enjoyed it with family members from 12 years old to 65.

On the other hand, if you are planning to have a more serious gaming session with more advanced players, probably it is not a very good choice.

Really the best gateway game for me : ultra-easy to teach, fun board and fun theme, with a strong strategy depth (there is an obvious difference between a first-timer and an experienced player, despite the simplicity of the gameplay).
What sells the prize to me is that, similarly to Carcassonne, you can either play competitively or "by yourself", and have fun in both cases, but contrary to Carc, a "nasty" move is costly to your own progress, and you only do it after careful examination (as opposed to attack as the only worthwhile way to play an unlucky tile).

I thought I wouldn't like this as much as TTR:Europe, which is the first game I played, but I like the tension on this board.  It's tough to get everywhere you want, especially when you can't use any stations to pull you through at the end!  The more I play this, the more I like this better than TTR:E.

Overall, I enjoy all the TTR games (I have all but Marklin).  Each works well in different groups and with different players.

Ticket to Ride is a fun "intermediary" game to me.  A game that I would happily suggest and play with a group of new or non-"board gamers" but one that I would pass up in a group of experienced board gamers.  It also serves well as a "warm up" r "cool down" game on long board game days though.

This game is excellent for gamers and non-gamers alike. The rules are simple, the goal is clear, the game plays quick and smooth and tension is building quickly.

But the game has a unexpected depth as well. Shall I go for the long routes (20 points or so) or the short ones? Shall I collect more cards for the long tracks (5 and 6) or spill it on the shorter ones?
How should I detour when other players disrupt my perfect plans? And do I detour deliberately for more points? Or even for more flexibility?

This game is brilliant!

A delightful but highly competitive card/strategy/train building game that I am sure will get a higher rating after more plays.  A bit light on theme, but can get very tense (in a good way) near the end.  Ticket to Ride is the only game I know of where the scoring phase at the end of the game is as high stakes as the actual game play.  Not recommended for people who are put-off by high competition or sabotage; both are a big element of this game.  Looking forward to playing more.

My husband and I really love this game. We played it many times (sometimes 3 per day) during my pregnancy. Now that our baby requires us to be more at home we find us playing this board game so happy as if we were dining out. Now we play it with more people and there is a sense of a party, mostly because of the game. I think that its best side is that you do not know if you may win or not until the end. I do not like Risk precisely for the opposite: Risk is designed for smashing others in a predatory way, so at the middle of the game a guy feels "dictatorial" and the others are just looking at their watches... I love Ticket to Ride exactly for being the opposite. TR has a little share of luck but no dice, so it is more strategical; almost all the players feel, throughout the game, that they can win. It is very easy to play, addictive and fun, really fun.

Nice tension between need to build up your hand for the future vs. the need to get track laid now before your opponents block you.  Easy enough to get new players and non-gamers into, but truly experienced players can easily demonstrate that there actually is a learning curve.

This is a great game, and I like the clean, elegant system of this game better than its descendants.

I object to the half-sized cards, particularly in a game that requires as much shuffling as this one.  But I guess if that's my only complaint, this game must be pretty darn good.

RATING: 7
Have only played once, and then in the company of extremely experienced players.  It definately wasn't bad, it's another of Moon's set collection games and that's something he apparently has a great deal of experince with.  But I found the limited actions frustrating -- the choices were hard but not in a particularly "fun" way.  The lots of things to do but limited choice is also found in "Through the Desert" or "E&T" where I always want to be doing 2 or 3 different things.  A key difference there, I think, is that I always have to do the same amount of work.  Here,  I feel ripped off if I have to play 1 train or I need to draw one more card to do something useful.  The geometric point progression confounds this by making the short tracks huge wastes of your time score wise instead of merely large losses that are necessary for position.  Again, this isn't to say that I think it isn't fun or that it is unbalanced, rather it was just that I often felt an odd feeling of having been ripped off.  The route cards require a large degree of knowledge of the deck making a light game substantially less light if played correctly.

Update: have played a few online games and my ho-hum opinion still stands.  Maybe the next game will make it click for me.

2-4p, 30m.   What I'd call a "light-medium" train game--more elaborate than TransAmerica, but simpler than Railroad Tycoon.

T2R is a spectacular series of games that everyone should know how to play. 

Having said that, the original version has some imbalance issues that required a fix with the USA 1910 version.

Ticket to ride is what I consider a good gateway board game which is easy to teach and good fun with a nice theme - plastic trains are pleasing in appearance and to place.

Personally I think it lasts slightly too long for the decisions involved (lots of turns just drawing cards).

Intended to give this to my Dad for Christmas, but in the time between ordering and receiving it I read so many more great reviews that I kept it myself!  It's great with two and great with more though it does feel like a very different game.  This will definitely be the game I use to get non gamers wanting more!

Is this the best game in the world ever?

I now own two copies since I forgot to pack it on a recent holiday and had to buy another so I could get my fix!

This is an 11 out of 10

RATING: 8
The perfect gateway game, while still being fun for experienced gamers -- TTR changed how I thought about board games, and taught me a lot about what I liked. I'd been sticking with games like Carcassonne despite fading interest, and playing TTR for the first time was like a breath of fresh air. I've gone on to really enjoy a lot of other lighter Euros, particularly Zooloretto.

TTR was also the first game my entire group was always in the mood to play -- a rarity! I prefer both Marklin and Europe to vanilla TTR, but I'll still happily play it anytime.

The only problem I've run into is that (at least the way my group plays it) whoever lucks into the best long route tends to win. I'm told that if you play TTR more aggressively -- blocking at every opportunity -- an entirely different game emerges; I'd like to try that.

Introduced to this game about 18 months ago as an introduction to the newer breed of games that have and continue to be released. This thing I love most about this game is that it a title my wife likes to play making it a good choice for the casual gamer. Really easy to pick up and play and does get you on the edge of your seat when you suspect a fellow player may be attempting to claim the same route that you want. Great replay ability however the game is best played with 4 players.

While I see how the game could be attractive to so many gamers, I find it weirdly unsophisticated (perhaps because of its roots in melding card games). There is just too little in this game that could contribute to its "fun-factor". It feels very dry, and I really don't enjoy the silence that this games seems to induce at the table. And that I don't seem to get a handle on how to win TtR:xx doesn't help either.

While being an elegant, in many ways even a paradigmatic or iconic design, I have zero fun playing it.

If you can accept this game for what it is (a largely luck-driven game) then you should enjoy it. If you do not like randomness, look elsewhere.

Pros: 
-Easy to learn
-Easy to teach
-Great gateway game for new gamers and fun to play with non-gamers as well
-Most people seem to enjoy it
-Limited AP
-Expandability seems endless

Cons:
-Considering its price tag, the components should be better (I had to upgrade to wooden trains).
-Minimal strategy involved. Mostly luck-driven--cards are usually drawn randomly
-Multiplayer solitaire--if you like high player interaction, then this is not the game for you. Direct confrontation is rare

Overall, I really enjoy this game. It has grown on me quite a bit thanks to the exceptional iPad implementation. For 2 players though, definitely check out Switzerland/India map or Big Cites under the 1910 expansion. I have played Nordic Countries and did not enjoy it. I would recommend TTR to most people. In particular, I think children 12 and under would enjoy this game. For serious gamers, it can certainly be frustrating. Though, if you can accept it for what it is--a light, fun game, and don't take it too seriously, I think even the most hardcore gamers can find a gem here.

Classic gateway with easy gameplay. Over time i have grown to prefer this one over TTR Europe. This one is simpler because you don't have to teach the extra train station rule that's in TTR Europe, which i hate having to explain multiple times to new players. This one also is more cutthroat, which adds a fun dimension to a simple gateway game.

I've rated this a 7 rather than the 8 which I've given to most of the other TtR games because this one is just so basic and open.

3 / 5 - Good.

Nice family game, but weaker than the Europe version. Seems like screwage isn't *that* much enhanced and the long, single routes that dominate the board seem to lead to over reliance on taking matching face-up cards which in turns means a bit more luck. See my review for more details: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/165401

As close to a perfect gateway game as you can get.  Simple, clear rules, fast play with minimal downtime, little luck involved, and with more players it gets intense as you hope no one takes the route you need.  Still, it can get tiresome to play often as the game is a bit repetitive

A great game for non-gamers. I like this game with any number of players. My wife and I have played it a couple times as a 2-player game. It was enjoyable. The game is solid with 3,4 or 5 players. It is best to adjust your strategy according to the number of players. Routes and tactics that work well in 3-player games, may not work well in 2-player or 5-player games for example. My family loves this game. Karen and I taught our Parents to play. They went back to Tulsa and bought 6 copies of the game as presents. Affectionately called "The Train Game."

RATING: 6.5
One of the standard gateway games that I play with non-gamers or if people want a shorter game.  It serves this purpose very well.

What I like:
- Very easy to teach.  Only 3 fairly simple actions to explain
- It is a fairly short game (45-60 minutes) and there is not much downtime between turns.
- There is some tension in being able to complete your routes without being blocked (4-5 players)

What I don't like:
- You can get screwed right from the beginning with a poor starting ticket hand
- Luck of the draw (both from the deck and the face up pile) largely determines if you can collect all the sets you need
- There is not much tension with 2 players

Despite all the hype, all the awards, and all the love, Ticket to Ride is merely an ok set collection game.  In it, you are attempting to collect cards of the same colour to complete train routes across North America.  Whomever completes the routes totalling the greatest number of points wins.

No doubt the components are top notch.  The overly large board is a nice map, and the cards are very good quality. The best component is the plastic train pieces that are put out on the board to complete routes.

When I discovered Airlines Europe, by the same designer, it killed any lingering desire I had for continued ownership of Ticket to Ride.  That game is also about making routes, but with much more interesting decisions.  I can not, in good conscience, ever recommend Ticket to Ride knowing the far superior Airlines Europe exists.

Best game of 2004 and one of my top10 favorites.
This is the ultimate modern boardgame. If you don't enjoy TTR then our tastes probably don't have much in common! TTR has very simple rules, lots of replayability, possibility of memorable games ("remember when I stole that huge road there"), beautiful components, chance to improve your skill and hint of luck to even it out for new players (and to add excitement). 1910 isn't necessary but it's certainly very recommended expansion if you plan to play a lot! This is simply PERFECT game that brings non-gamers and gamers together in unique way.

2-Player Comment:
* I love all Ticket to Ride maps as 2p, it's the game I play most often with my wife.

We just "own" the computer version... despite buying TtRE, we got free access to TtRUSA - go figure. Feels a lot simpler than the European version - no tunnels, ferries or stations - just collect sets and slap 'em down. The single country (OK, 2) is a little dull, too, the Duluth-Houston link is hardly evocative of an epic train journey! The quality of play online is decent but weirdly, the downtime feels longer than when FtF despite the reverse being true. The computer AI in the solo version of the game is regrettably very weak, and you have to be pretty unlucky to lose even in what should be a crowded 5 player game.

We've been playing this quite a lot since getting it, and are having a tremendously good time.

Plus, my wife really likes it because she has whupped up on me several times by a huge spread of points (and the little trains seem to hold special appeal for her.)

A pointless "collect cards until you've got them enough and start playing them" game. Do you ever have less than 30 cards in your hand (after a few rounds)? Come on, this game doesn't have enough beef.

RATING: 8
The word 'angst' is often used as a compliment for a game. We all want hard and crucial decisions to make each turn in our games. But for me Ticket to Ride has too much angst! You get to do so little per turn compared to what you'd like/need to do that it often feels very frustrating. The worst thing is playing a connection that is less than 4 trains. It is such an obviously inefficient move that it is literally painful to do. I don%u2019t think a game should punish a player so harshly for doing what is the central mechanic of the game %u2013 connecting two cities with trains. ****UPDATE**** After several more plays I've raised my rating a point. The funny thing is I still agree with all my criticisms above, but there's no denying that the game has a certain spark. And it's such a great introductory game for newbies that it deserves some credit for that. Overall I think it's a fine game that I don't mind playing.

Awesome game. A nice game where multiple strategies can win, there is just enough luck and variability to keep it interesting without ruining things, and where you may have to change strategies even to win, not just react. And it has trains, so there you are :)

A great concept from start to finish and clearly it's been successful. It plays quickly if you think when it's not your turn, otherwise it can cause lag. Great looking board and pieces, good instructions, flexible for different number of players. 

Great replayability.

This game is so freaking great I love it so much!
Even my non-gaming family has gotten into it; I've come home from work in the evenings more than once to find my parents in the middle of a game.

I TtR mostly online, though, probably 10+ games a week. You would think with that much game time under my belt, I'd be a threatening player. You would think. And be wrong.
(Seriously, Wil Wheaton has nothing on my lose streak :/)

RATING: 3
Very drawn out game. The first half of the game is somewhat engaging as you plan out the routes you intend to complete, the second half is just running the deck of cards you draw to the end which gets dull. There are some tactics to be had in blocking your opponents and the board is well designed it just feels rather basic with not much replayability.

RATING: 7
Take possession of color-coded railroads between cities by gaining and spending cards.

Easy game to understand, good for families.
Relies quite heavily on luck though, both with the destinations you get and the Wagon Cards you can pick.
Also, since the objectives are secret, it's pretty much a solitaire game until another player is taking routes near the ones you're trying to get and you have to adapt.

Other than that, a pleasant experience

We played it 7 or 8 times in under a week (including going out and buying a copy) - that says it all! Tactics and strategy are comparable to much longer games, which gives good gaming satisfaction for a 45 minute investment.

I always look at the game, and think, I don't really want to play that.  It's too simple.  It's not very attractive.  Yet whenever I open it up and play, I almost always have a good time!  It's a simple, but fun game.  Great for families.  Great as a 2 player game.

One of the first games I bought in 2011.  I LOVE it.  But a lot of the experienced gamers won't play this game with me.  So it's a little harder to bring out the game days.  So the rating is a bit lower.

I loveeeeeee this game.  New players also like this game a lot.

The definitive gateway game. Not at all complicated, easy to teach, colorful, engaging for family and non-gamers. This has been a smashing success with everyone I've introduced it to, and train loving hobbyists in the family all got them for christmas. If you are more of a gamer, get the Europe version, but either deserve a place in your collection even if just to amuse the family.

RATING: 9
Another great 'Infection vector' for getting new people into board games, suitable for children if you are willing not to be too strategic with them (i.e. don't block their obvious destination as they march from one city to the other link-by-link). On the other hand, when playing with adults there's nothing quite so much fun as buying a link somebody else clearly needs just to make them go the long way around. A good game to play before Munchkin.

Any game that is easy enough to attract new gamers is an A+! Quick, easy to understand, great theme, a set collecting game. Very enjoyable! Simple and luck does play a part in collection, but enough strategy to keep me interested. My mom is a TtR pro and will almost always wipe the board with the other players!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
My main complaint is that the cards are worth so many points that the difference between finishing one (and getting positive points) and missing the goal by 1 train (and getting negative points) can be a 20-30 point swing, which is nearly 40% of your total score.

This game combines all the elements I loathe: luck-based points (in both card types), geography, and trains (yeah, you heard me - I don't like trains in games!). I don't mind luck games if they're quick, but this one's just painful.

I would give this game one more point if it were changed to Ticket to Rollercoaster, or Ticket to Dungeoncrawl.

Strictly 2p rating: The board is way too big to create any kind of tension unless you both compete for the same area by chance. While I knew that beforehand, I got the game at an discount price, so I bought it anyway. Will trade this away after getting TtR:E equally cheap, since it is suited way better for two and we really don't need both of them.

Traded away in Nov. '14 Math Trade.

The epitome of an average game? I dislike the lack of player interaction in this one. It's essentially 4-5 people playing a 1 player game together occasionally getting irritated when another player draws cards before they do. Having played it 6 times now I feel that creating the longest tracks regardless of tickets ends the game at a length where I'm not sorry I wasted my time and never leaves you in last place. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.25
Interesting game of train routes that is really about optimizing over a grid.  The idea is to tie various cities together that are distant - the farther they are apart, the higher the score.  The best way of doing this is to build a web of routes and then get destination cards that are close to what you already have built.  It's a fun game and can get a little tense if you try to destroy other players' goals.

05/14/04 I don't like train games. Played twice. Too much chance. Either you draw extra destination cards that work for you (therefore you win), or they don't (therefore you lose badly). Or if you don't take any extra cards you're bound to finish in the middle. Why not just save an hour and flip a coin. I wouldn't play this again unless it was with children. - - - - 

12/21/04 I lied. I got conned into playing it a third time. Still don't like it. Also what the game calls red on the cards looks orange on the board. And what it calls orange on the cards looks brown on the board. I found this very confusing.

To be honest, there's something snobby in me that always tries to avoid taking Ticket to Ride off the shelf.  I think I imagine it as a game that isn't complicated enough to be a "real gamer's game."

Other games take the TtR formula and take it leaps and bounds above what this game offers, but this still stands as one of the great gateway games to turn newcomers on to resource management/territory control games.

This game will have every turn ending with players lamenting over their singular action and worrying about another player ruining their well-laid plans. From that comes my only real gripe with the game - it can be easy to dogpile a player in the lead, especially if you're a veteran who knows the route values and destinations more so than a newbie. With that in mind, it's generally best to minimize table talk and pseudo-quarterbacking between players.

If you're a veteran to the genre, you probably already have this game or can skip it, but it's a solid game to have in the collection otherwise.

Just so you know, I'm making this review after only one play.

I'm not sure if I played it wrong, but I remember it feeling like there was almost zero strategy.  You just pulled cards waiting for the color you wanted then put down a train.  Ticket to Ride Europe looks interesting but this version isn't much fun.

Only fun for casual players.
After a couple of initial plays it really started to lose it's shine for me, so I got  the 1910 expansion. Didn't help much. Should I try the Europe or Marklin variant? I don't feel inclined. I'm just keeping this box long enough to see if my baby boy will like it someday, and get rid of it really fast once I find out he doesn't like it (anymore) either.

Update: sold. By the time my kids is big enough there will be plenty of games where I'd probably have some fun with.

This has been called the greatest gateway game ever, and I'd have to agree with that assessment.  This game has beautiful pieces and artwork, plus it's simple to explain, simple to understand, and simple to play.  It's so easy to get new players excited about this game, and the strategy is simple enough that everyone has a good time playing it.  The really tough strategy comes through meta-gaming as you try to outsmart your opponents and block their success, but none of that is required for simply having an enjoyable game.  While I'd generally prefer to play a more strategic middle-weight game with more experienced players, I love playing this game with a group of casual gamers.

Truly a gem in our family!  The game has some excellent qualities that are seemingly exclusive of each other.  Relatively deep planning and strategy with very little downtime.  Oftentimes, it's my turn again just after pouring myself a cup of coffee (yes, it's just that fast!).  Also, the scoring mechanisms are straightforward and doesn't require a lot of fiddling.  The game's final outcome always leaves everyone on the edge of their seat.  Truly a game that draws you in and keeps you.

RATING: 9
Lightweight and easy to teach to new players, very approachable theme, and simple play mechanics.  Certainly not the deepest strategy game, but as a simple, fun game it works very well.  My only complaint is that more players makes the game much more interesting, but also much longer.  Five players can make for a 2-3 hour game, which is far longer than the depth warrants.

RATING: 7.2
Quick and super easy to learn. There is some strategy but a lot of this game has to do with the luck of your route cards. IMO TTR is actually a little overrated. The main reason I'd take it out for a play is if I want to use it as a gateway game for non-gamers.

A top favorite of our workplace lunch group.  Easy to get newbies up to speed quickly.  Only slight negative: limited direct interaction with other players, outside of taking a route someone else wanted.  One is usually concentrating on completing their own routes and less on what someone else is up to.  (Get the new card expansion!)

RATING: 6.5
Very light but great to play with non-gamers. For two players, the big city expansion included with 1910 makes it pretty competitive. Big Cities Variant with 5 players is down right nasty.

Update: I don't know. I like this game but I get killed at it all the time. I can't remember the last time I won a game.

RATING: 7.5
Game in a Nutshell: Collect and play cards to create a chain of your trains connecting cities across the map. 

Played as: 3,4,5 player (online: 4 and 5 player)

Played with: 1910 expansion and without.

Pros: Fast pace, involving from beginning to end. Visually, very satisfying in a way that gives players a sense of progress when compared to other cube-pushers. My favorite map in the Ticket to Ride series, and the one best suited as a gateway for fellow Americans. And big props to any game that will get the non-gamers out there interested. You get a code when purchased that lets you play it online... with real people! 

Cons: Really there's one dominant strategy to this map and rules-set and it can hinge on what route cards you get. Generally the player who gets luckiest there is going to win. It's not going to draw in all new gamers since there isn't as much thought involved and may not feel challenging intellectually.

Other: It's been said that the expansion does more to fix the game rather then expand on it. I wouldn't go that far as I believe there is still a worthy game even without it. 

Best Use: Moving the rummy-variant aficionados into games with boards.

RATING: 8
Not a deep game, but overall a great game to play with non-gamers. There is some strategy involved in selecting routes which is something I like as opposed to solely a luck based game (though of course there is some luck with destination and train card draws). Can't say I would like to play this game all the time, but normally won't pass this up because it's one of the few games I can get my family to play. Only reason game is not a 9 is because I do get bored of the game, but still play anyway because it still provides somewhat of a challenge and tension and because my family enjoys it.

I really USED to love this game. It was one of the first strategy games I learned. Very simple rules- collect cards and use cards of the same color to build routes connecting cities. Non-gamers can easily learn the rules in 5 minutes and play it in 30 minutes.

Some resource management in terms of deciding what cards to collect and when/where/how to build the routes.

However, after playing it online for a year, I have burnt out on the game big time. I do bring it every week to my games group as it's very popular among the lighter gamers and they can easily teach others to play. I think it's a good starter game but lacks the challenges, variety, and strategy to keep gamers interested in it.

26-Jan-2014:  Still my favorite "gateway" game.  It's a great option for family gaming or a lighter option for hobby gamers.  With the absolute must-buy USA 1910 expansion, the replay value of this one is very high.  The rules are simple.  The components are great.  This is my first recommendation to any new gamer or family interested in the hobby.

08-Feb-2013: This is easily my favorite family friendly hobby game (or "gateway" game, if you will).  If you boil it down, it's basically a rummy style, set collection card game.  Players collect cards of various colors and when you have enough of one color to make a link between two cities on the map, you turn the cards in and place your trains marking track you own on the map.  You get points for reaching destinations based on other cards you choose at the beginning of the game as well as ones you add during gameplay.

This is a simple, fun, easy to learn/teach game for almost anyone.  Some gamers may find it too light and lacking in strategy for their taste, but for the right audience, this is an easy win in my book.

The components are great with a large, thick map board.  There are colorful, plastic trains to place on the map.  The one negative I have is the size of the cards that come with the base game.  Unless you have hands the size of a 6 year old, they can be pretty annoying.  I highly recommend buying the 1910 Expansion immediately upon purchase of the base set.  It's so worth it.  You get full size cards to replace the ones in the base game.  And you get additional destination cards, one additional end bonus card, and three additional ways to play the game.

We play this game with unintentional conflict, for the most part.  As a family, we are all generally working on our own set collections and destinations.  Eventually, as the map fills up more and more, you'll get in each others' way, but it's not malicious.  However, you can also just play it cutthroat and grab those hard to get, smaller connections right from the start and look to purposely block your opponents once you have a good idea where they are headed.  It depends on your group.

Either way, this is one of the best games I own for almost any situation where I want others to get a feel for our hobby.  It's not the deepest game around, but I think it's one of the best.

Ticket to Ride offers quite a bit of bang for your buck, where I measure bucks in terms of time required to explain the game, ability to play without referring to the rules, and to play comfortably without too much familiarity with the game, or with gaming in general; and bang in terms of giving you different things to think about (timing, long routes vs. completing lots of tickets...) and different possible approaches. First time, Carl made a spider, which I thought was an intriguing borrowing of strategy from Havannah, which he's never played... 

Lighter than I'd imagined, but a very simple set of rules, which I appreciate. In theory, as people get more experienced and learn the cards, the game could turn overly defensive for something so light, although I haven't actually experienced this, and it seems to be addressed by the 1910 expansion. 

I had to drop my rating a bit due to the endgame problem. (That is, "luck into" a win by drawing the right tickets near the end, when you've nothing else to do.) I also have a problem with some details like the Duluth-to-Houston route being so useless. But (unlike Carcassonne) I'm still playing it, and it seems to have legs. Better with three than with two.

This is a classic gateway game that works well with most families or non-gamers.  If you are new to gaming or need something to introduce others to this hobby this is a great choice.  However, my favorite of the series is the Europe version, so after reading these comments go check out my Europe comments.

In ticket to ride players are fighting to build train connections between cities.  Also enough of these connections will make a destination route from one city to another that isn't next to it.  Whoever can do the best will score the most points and win.

To start the game each player is dealt 3 destination routes.  These have point values on them where longer routes are worth more points than shorter routes.  So going from El Paso to Denver isn't worth as many points as going from San Francisco to Atlanta.  Before starting you may give up one of your routes if it just doesn't seem to fit well with the others, because it is advantageous to work on multiple routes all at once.

Now play will continue around the table with each player getting to choose one action from three options.  The first, and probably most commonly used, is to take train cards.  Five of them will be face up, with the rest face down.  These are a bunch of different colors that match the colors on the map which are required to get a certain connection between to cities.  You can either take a face up wild card, or you can take any two other cards, either face up or face down.  The other option is to use these train cards to actually build on the map.  One key here is once you take a connection nobody else can use it, so getting blocked and having to go around is common.  Each of these connections will score you points as you go.  The last option is to draw additional destination routes.  You draw 3, but you only have to keep 1 of them.  You can keep all 3 if you want, but this isn't common.

The game ends when somebody uses up almost all their trains (until they have less than 3) and each player then gets one last turn.  Then you add on to your points for each destination ticket you completed, and take away points for each one you don't.

This is very simple, for new gamers it can be very addictive.  This is a must have for any collection, although as I said before, I prefer the Europe version to this one.

Enjoy it.  Light, a random element but it takes a decent bit of thought to play well, with a few different routes you can take(meant in the figurative sense).  Go for 5-6 length routes to score points.  Go for shorter length routes focusing on making a 'spiderweb' to make it easy to pick up extra destinations.  Play vicious and make connections solely to block others off.  It's enjoying a lot of play right now due to the fact its a recent addition, but I have the feeling this will be a 'at least once every two gaming sessions' light game.

Even though I have rated this game an 8, I am underwhelmed with it.  It is just another, greatly altered form of rummy, and the theme is tenuous, at best.  That being said, it is a game I greatly enjoy.  It is fun and easy to learn and play.  Following the new system recomendations, it is an 8.  If I had to rate it on it's merits, it would be a 6...barely.I just do not see what the fuss is about...or do I?  I did give it an 8...

The original TtR is a great social game and is definitely more than a filler for more serious gamers. Without the 1910 expansion, though, strategies are severely limited and the luck of the ticket draw can be decisive.

RATING: 3
Best with 3 or 5 players, that's when things get congested and therefore interesting.  Still, it's a big spread out board and it's easy to go a whole game with only one instance where you cross paths with another player.  Ticket to Ride: Europe is much better!  This game is much too light for me.

A simple concept that can lead to deceptively complex game play.  This game was quite popular over the Christmas holiday of 2005.  I was able to introduce my extended family to the concept of board games without dice!  Because this game is so easy to jump in and go, it was very well received.  I actually lost on the first game to my sister who blew us all out of the water.  Fortunately I was able to redeem myself otherwise seppuku would have been in order.

My sister-in-law got this game for Christmas, so at 5pm on Xmas day we sat down to play. Playing one game after another, we finished at 1am! The next day, the calls started early afternoon:
'You busy this evening? Maybe you want to play Ticket to Ride again?'
'Actually, I was gonna call you and suggest it, but I didn't want to sound like I've been thinking about it all morning.'
We played again on the 26th, 27th and New Year's Day. It's truly addictive.
There's a great cocktail of emotions when you play Ticket to Ride: Hope that you'll build your lines and complete tickets, fear that others will block your routes, relief at securing key connections and frustration when your plans are thwarted. Playing at a fast tempo with practically no downtime, you rollercoaster between these positive and negative emotions for 45 minutes and finish wanting more! 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A simple game at first. When you have some experience, you learn to guess what tickets your opponents have and what routes they will take. Then you can block them or make sure they don't grab a route you want before they do. There are also a lot of card-drafting tactics you can learn.

Very easy to learn. Surprisingly fun. Challenging without being overtaxing on the ol' noggin. One big drawback is that the colors can be very hard to distinguish (especially for someone like me with red-green color-blindness; that's why it gets a 9.5 and not a 10). Great with two players, even better with four!

Played once.  This is a relatively simple network building game, but it's simplicity is its beauty.  It takes only minutes to explain, yet it's got both strategic (planning which routes to build) and tactical elements (responding to other players who are getting in your way), heavy player interaction (only a few trains can follow each route), and enough hard decisions to make the game just deliciously frustrating.  While it's no Puerto Rico or El Grande, it's a fun, enjoyable game.

I like this game but it has a fatal flaw for me, going for the longest routes seems to win the game at a high rate. A house rule to prevent just picking up cards and going longest routes is needed or it just turns into mindless card drawing until you can drop a six route.

Draft and play sets of cards to build train routes and connect tickets for most points.

Plays: More than 100.
Type: VP race = a game where you race to collect victory points (fastest/most).
Complexity: Family game = a game that is easy to teach and play.
# of players: 3-5.
Playing time: 10 mins per player.
Player interaction: Competition for routes.
Randomness: Medium - card draw (lower with USA 1910 expansion).

Replayability: Very high, often everyone wants to play again immediately.
Fun: The fun lies in the decision making of hand and board management.
Memorability: Low, it's a VP engine that doesn't create stories.

Thematic integration: Weak.
Components: Nice.
Expansions: Definitely get USA 1910.

Who will like this: Everyone. No kidding. This is a must-have in every game collection. I have yet to encounter anyone who doesn't enjoy TTR. Even non-gamers often buy their own copy after playing.

I have been playing board games my entire life but I have only been a real hobby gamer for the past year. This game will forever have a special place in my heart. It is always fun, it's a fantastic game, and it's almost always a challenge. You can even have fun playing this game with people who are normally not that fun to play board games with (alpha-gamers), in my personal experience. It was my gateway game, but it's also an incredible gateway game. I can't recommend it enough.

Szinte az összes TtR megvan 1-2 kivétellel, úgyhogy helytakarékossági okok miatt ezt már csak android appban vásároltam meg.

Szerintem az Európánál gyengébb valamivel (nincsenek kompok és alagutak pl), de egyébként teljesen jól működik az USA térkép is, főleg ha legalább négy játékos pakolgatja le egyszerre a vagonjait.

Kettesben nem túl jó a hatalmas térkép miatt, mert kevés az interakció (bár az az Európával sem az igazi, 2-3 játékosra a Nordic ajánlott, azt kifejezetten úgy tervezték, hogy kevesen is jó legyen).

Beugró játéknak oké, de inkább akkor már a TtR Europe vagy a Nordic, esetleg valamelyik egzotikus térkép (India, Afrika).

Days of Wonder produciton.  Nice quality.  1st edition cards are really small.  Good "gateway" game as well as a nice quickie for more seasoned gamers.  If everyone knows how to play, Ticket to Ride can easily be tackled in 35-40 minutes.  Highly conducive to pounding beers!  Extra fun if all players agree to a "full aggression" pact, continually blocking each other's routes!

A solid 6.  Fun to play, but not enough of a gamers game for me to actually crave playing it.

Suggested strategy would seem to be to accumulate a number of train cards over the first few rounds, then start laying down routes, aiming for the higher scoring, longer sections where possible.

A fun game that goes over well with anyone I play with, gamer or no.  I read so many positive reviews over about this that I had to pick it up, and it was a good purchase, but my interest has waned after only a few short games.  Now I also think I have an acute case of adult A.D.D. so take that comment for whatever it's worth.  :)  There is assuredly a good game here.  Your replayability experience may vary.

RATING: 7
Fun, and works well as an introduction to modern board games. Rules are very simple (my rules teaching video runs for about six minutes), and the game play is fun. A good casual game, but not interesting enough to play with gamers.

Suggest.

RATING: 8
Awesome game to play with anyone. It's quick and it's easy. For people who want a more strategic game, you can sort of have that in this game while at the same time play with someone who isn't heavily thinking about it and that person may, in fact, win the game.

Good, light fun. Not a huge deal, but I can get the family to play it with me and not feel like beating my head against the table.

At least, I thought so.

As I noted for TTR: Europe, I am at a point now, where this is ultimately a total yawn-fest. I mean seriously, there may as well not even be a board and plastic trains - the game would play just as well with the deck of cards and a chart that lists score values for trading in particular sets. That really is all there is to it. No trading, no real interaction, just take cards or play cards. Not really that much fun. There are games they refuse to play with me. This may be one of the games I refuse to play with them.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Fun game, but a little too much luck, I think. If a player draws a long route early, the game is heavily biased towards their eventual victory. A decent online game also makes the game available to people who otherwise might not come out for a board game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
For a design that ought to lead to a lighter, more social Eurogame, Ticket to Ride rewards silent and intense strategic contemplation and punishes players who are interested in talking together or otherwise interacting. (Cf. Settlers, where talk is built into the core mechanics of the game.) Also, as a game that rewards undermining other players its character seems closer to, say, Caylus than to Dominion. If you are not playing the game intensely, it seems more luck-driven than BGG players usually enjoy.

I have two main problems with TtR.  First of all, it's too easy to score points strictly by taking only the longest routes, despite the tickets you start with.  Just snag as many six-spot routes as you can and you'll almost always win - you can usually pick up a ticket or two along the way with only a couple of other routes.  Second, I despise the way that on the last turn or two of the game, someone who's losing can shoot the moon - they just grab three tickets, hoping that they'll either already have one completed, or be able to easily complete one by slapping down a quick one or two train route.  It's risky enough that someone in the lead should not try it, but not so risky that it doesn't work a good portion of the time.  It just irritates me.  A good gateway game, though, and we've used it successfully to bring a few gamers into the "Euro-Gamer" fold, and then we can move them along to something I like better.  (And it's all about me, of course...)

Willing to Trade this version, probably played 3 times, the box top corners are taped. (Does anyone else have this problem with Days of Wonder games (Small world too)). We then obtained the 10th anniversary addition and the components for the 10 Anniversary addition are far superior, making this version untouched.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A good, easy-to-teach game with an interesting theme and fairly nice components.
Suffers from the luck of the draw (literally); you can be stuck drawing card after card that you don't want. I've seen players sat with a hand of nearly 20 cards who still can't complete the route they desperately need.

RATING: 8
We bought this one second hand to complete our collection of Ticket to Ride. I don't like the original as much as the Europe version: you get blocked much more easily and without the railway stations, it becomes very hard to fulfill all your tickets. Traded away because we bought the 10th anniversary edition.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.2
Ticket to Ride is the forbidden fruit of board games. Give one bite and your friends and family will be hooked on new generation board games.
The real joy of this game is the sheer simplicity in teaching novices. However, it still has quite a strong degree of strategy. Basically, it is a great game to introduce others to the world of board game geeks and show your friends that there is a world beyond Monopoly and Scrabble.

I've played this game to death. It's okay for what it is, but every time I play it, I am reminded of why I've gravitated away from gateway games. Too much luck of the draw. Get a good set of tickets, and you're golden. Get stuck with a couple duds, or get blocked out of the route you wanted to build, and you're going to have a bad game. Both of those things can be mitigated somewhat, of course. You can (and should) pay attention to what color cards your opponents are drawing, where they're building on the board, etc. But that only goes so far, and more often than not, you still end up being at the mercy of the tickets you've drawn.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
After Catan, perhaps the most well-known gateway game. Easy to teach but with enough complexity to be (somewhat) interesting. As a gateway game, I find it gets played a bit too often. The expansion is a must if only for the standard-size cards.

RATING: 8.6
Ticket to Ride shows how a few simple rules can be combined to make an exceptionally rich and deep playing experience.  When played quickly, this feels like a wild race of the wits - it is fast, exciting, suspenseful and challenging.

EUROPE:  This is such a big map that there is no competition for routes.  Competition is further lessened by the station rules.  I guess this is good for folks who like a less aggressive style of play, but other maps support both play styles whereas this one does not allow for the aggressive, "dynamite joe" style of play.

ASIA: One side is a large map meant to be played with teams.  I haven't played the team game, but it's otherwise a big open map.  The smaller modern Asia map is a good map with some tough routes.

UK:  The board is a bit hard to read.  The technologies divide your attention away from the card-play and route-building.  It's a different feeling experience.

PENN:  The stock buying is somewhat neat, but not great at 2-players.

(Includes 1910, Europe, Asia, UK expansions)

Even though it's a light weight game, I have to give this one a 10. It's a perfect game for what it is. EVERYBODY we've introduced this to loves it, even non-gamers. Our regular gaming group doesn't play this much anymore since we play it enough with others and there are definately more meaty games we'd like to play. All that said this game has probably been played more than any other since we bought it last year (2006). Also, a much better game to teach newcomers than Settlers. People just 'get it' a lot faster.

Perfect as a light/medium weight gateway game; everyone who I've played this with liked it and the majority of them have purchased their own copies.  Our game group likes it as a lighter game, and it also has been very popular with non-gaming family and friends.  Easy to teach, quick to play, and scales well from 3-5 (I'm not crazy about it for 2).  Beautiful components.  This game has seen more play than any other game of similar weight and length in my collection and I can't see that ever changing.

Gateway game. So simple your parents can learn to play this in five minutes. Despite being dead simple, the game is still so, much, fun. Repeated plays only add to the fun as a cool meta game of "I am soooo sure you're trying to complete ticket XYZ, so I'm going to block you off here" emerges.

Ticket to Ride oder deutsch Zug um Zug ist schon fast ein Klassiker unter den Brettspielen und sollte in keiner Sammlung fehlen. Denn das Spielprinzip ist schnell erklärt und einfach zu meistern, liefert aber trotzdem genügend Abwechslung, um nicht zu schnell langweillig zu werden. Die Spieler müssen Zugstrecken zwischen einzelnen Städten vervollständigen, dafür benötigen sie Karten in der entsprechenden Farbe. Außerdem hat jeder Spieler noch Zielkarten, wodurch eher mehrere Städte miteinander verbinden muss. Dafür gibt es extra Siegpunkte.

A solid fun game with multiple ways to complete your routes, and strategy to too cut others off from completing their routs. Very fun game, think next year instead of passing out Christmas cheer bottles i will hand out Ticket to Ride games. After a few games my impression of game is same, a real hit, highly recommended.

I enjoy the game.  I also have it on the IPOD Touch, which is an excellent implementation.  The IPOD version is so good, it's impacted my plays with the board game.  I'm not recording Ticket To Ride Pocket plays here or the playcount would be much higher.

We've got this on IOS and have so many other options when we have time to play a game, this still sits idle on the shelf.

Funny light game that suits anybody, it´s not actually a train-game. It´s more of tile-laying game but with traincars instead of bricks. Screw your opponents routs or concentrate on your own, doing both often results in a loss. Played with 2,3,4 and 5 people and everthing works very well. Too light for me to hold that rating of 8 that I gave it after the first plays.

RATING: 6.25
It's obviously a fantastic gateway game.  No doubt about that.

That said, I prefer TTR:Europe to TTR for a few reasons:
 - I like the tunnels.  Yes, it adds some randomness, but it also adds a little tension.
 - I like the stations.  It adds another possible decision while making the game a little more newbie-friendly.
 - I prefer the European map more.  Of course, this is entirely subjective.

RATING: 8
Elegant and easy to learn. Lacks the depth that TTR Europe offers, but this is THE version to introduce non-board gamers to the hobby. A classic plain and simple.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Quick and reasonably easy to teach but I doubt TTR's ability as a gateway. Trains just aren't cool to non-gamers. TTR is better suited as a game for nerdy families than a gateway for non-gamers. I find basic TTR to be a bit dull, too, but I won't object if someone badly wants to play it.

This game never fails to be a winner, almost everyone who we play this with goes out and gets themselves a copy.

Good duration (30-45mins), plays well with 2, easy to explain and learn for beginners, tense start to finish (building quickly towards the end),  enough luck that beginners have a chance, while still allowing strategies to support a good score.

Highly recommended as a gateway game and as a gift.

It's a fine game, but I'm not sure if it's worth all that jazz. It actually feels somewhat soulless to me, even though it IS quick, elegant and easy to learn. 

I also think it's basically just a pastel-coloured solitaire (the pastels are probably the reason it feels soulless), but maybe I just don't pay enough attention to what other people are doing... 'cause I just don't care. Also, I haven't tried out Ticket to Ride: Europe, which I hear is the ultimate version & has some more features.

A lovely game that has the advantage that a lot of people know it. It has so many small details that I'll mention in the following paragraphs that together make it sooo good!

The moment someone first starts placing their trains and everyone is like "Oh God, I better hurry up" and also start placing their trains like a chain reaction. Sooo funny!

The wild trains make this game amazing! "Should I place this route now that I can with the wild train or should I wait till I get the right color so I still have it left for later?" Mostly I choose the later and just end up with lots of unused wild trains.

Lastly, the moment you think "I kinda want a pink train, but there is none in the pool. I do have literally every other train though so I have nothing to lose drawing 2 blindly right? Oh God, I didn't have a green train yet! WHAT?! BROWN IS IN THE GAME TOO?!"

The only problem I find though is that it's hard to sell the game to someone with just the theme. Also, counting points is a bit tedious compared to other games but at least you don't know (exactly) how far you are behind.

The mechanics of the game are fine, and the struggle to complete routes is engaging, but I feel as though I've only ever hit the top layer of the strategy on this one.  If this is the game that's being played, I'm willing and even happy to fill a seat, but I don't think I'm likely to suggest this.

Don't be fooled by Ticket to Ride.  It's light wargame that the whole family can enjoy.  First, you need to plan your axis of attack using destination cards.  Then you assemble your forces to conquer as many cities as you can - while keeping your lines of communication open.  It's great fun to foil your opponent's plans by conducting spoiler attacks to deny his or her avenue of approach or to keep the enemy guessing.  There are some tough choices that need to be made at the endgame which adds to the tension level.  After playing TtR, you'll be ready to move up to A Victory Lost.

UPDATE: Definitely not a game I want to play that often anymore, but I keep it around due to its nearly universal appeal.

The 1st time I played this game... I was open in my expectations yet still anticipating that it would be very good as it has a lot of supporters on BGG. I didn't get an immediate vibe of... "yes this is very good". Upon playing a 2nd and 3rd time it has improved as I see the strategies and tactics that can be explored in the game. The game is dead simple to play  and learn yet there are enough points where you need to make interesting and meaningful decisions that the game is not just a spiraling luck fest. While I don't think the game is extremely deep... there are several interesting strategies that can be pursued and I think we will get our money's worth out of this one as replayability looks good at this point. I have basically played only 2 player so far but 3-5 player looks to be even more interesting.

I finally got to play this "gateway game" and Ticket to Ride certainly deserves its reputation. Simple and approachable with subtle interaction and a good balance between skill and luck. Plan your rail network based on hidden objectives but act before someone else claims a railway. Gamble to accept new objectives but be prepared to be penalized if you fail. A bit similar to the deeper Power Grid (which is recommended as the next game if you like Ticket to Ride).

It Sucks.  T2R is a game of trains. Build railroads which are previously marked on the board. Build the big ones first and be rewarded for it... then, start playing towards your mission cards. Pretty straight game and you play towards the same strategy over and over... until you get bored.

Though, this game can be used to help a kid reach the table... under his butt.

Overall comments: This is a rummy type game that is played with a board and a train theme. It is simple to grasp the concept and easy to get up and playing quickly. Card players have no trouble transitioning to this game.

Ratings:
Initial(wow factor):8 (very bright and colorful but the trains seemed kind of cheap)
Family: 6 (playing by the rules); 8 (playing developed variant)
Game group: 5 (most refuse to play it but I have one friend who enjoys the game)
AP rating: 9 (decisions are light)
Solo play: 8 (a very thought provoking twist on the Ticket to Ride idea - it takes away/limits the downsides to the original play - TtR Europe SoloPlay has also been put together)

When purchased: 2006
Recommend expansions: No
Age range: 8+ (4+ when playing variant)
Time to play: 60 minutes (20 minutes with variant)
Luck factor: 7 (card game but you can choose from those left by others)

Reason purchased: Geek and looking for a gateway game

Pros: it plays quick and decisions are light
Cons: bland play and if played correctly (ie. not using a variant) is very boring, card hoarding makes the gameplay inconsistent, game scores at the end are usually not close, game group won't touch it.  I played the Swiss expansion and that didn't help my opinion.  If anything it deepened it.

Recommendation: if you are a card player you may find this game an interesting diversion.  If you are looking for a strategic game, this is not it.  I do not recommend this game for the serious gamer.
Replayability: Low (plays the same everytime)
Gamevalue (play/cost ratio):Medium (only the occasional family variant play gets the game any group time but the SoloPlay rules set has increased the value to acceptable)

I'd rank this game differently depending on the group I'm going to play it with.  It's a great neutral game that is very dependable for almost any group of adults.  My experience with kids and teens, though, is that the game is just a tiny bit too abstract (kids) and lacking in overt conflict (teens).  Fun, but not a quite a first choice.

I've got many iterations of this game but it just sits at a reluctant play for me. It is great for introducing new people to more current board games that likely use similar mechanics that they may have seen before but I only begrudgingly sit down at the table for this one.

Together with the Setllers of Catan, Ticket to Ride gave me a warm welcome back into the world of board gaming. As the publisher intends, Ticket to Ride is extremely easy to learn. Its rulebook has only one page!

Love its components and simple gameplay.

Collect cards of a train route to claim routes and fulfill destination tickets to earn points. Longer routes give more points. This maybe Alan Moon's best game so far. Lots of angst when deciding to collect cards but seeing your opponents inch closer to one of your destinations. Also tough decisions to whether draw from the destination ticket pile as well. Some luck on what you draw as destinations, and from drawing from the top of the train pile. The best game to play as an introductory Eurogame and can be played with any group.

A bit too light for me, with very little interaction. That said, it's still a decent game if you don't mind racing to the finish line without too much interference from your opponents. More of a family game. Kids ages 5&up picked it up quick after a short explanation and enjoyed it immensely.

I honestly don't understand the popularity of this game. at all. It is such a boring mediocre game. I would never recommend it as a gateway game either, because if I were new to boardgameing and got introduced this game, I will not come back to boardgaming again.

The game is essentially rummy variant. You spend many turns drawing two cards - oh dear. There is very little player-interaction in this game. It costs too much to block your opponents. So blocking happens rather randomly. This sort of random personal attack is my least favorite aspects in the player-interaction. You can, but don't need to care about other people's hand in this game because blocking is rare as the map has many alternative routes.

Destination cards have too much luck and huge swing between completion or incompletion - positive or negative. This is too rough and seems very unbalanced. Also tickets are valued merely by the length and, needless to say, they are quite unbalanced.

I must mention that the scoring scheme is extremely artificial. 1,2,4,7,10,15? What kind of sequence is that?
http://www.research.att.com/~njas/sequences/A027384
Long segments (5 or 6) clearly has huge advantage because they are far more economical. So of course everyone just keeps drawing cards until they get a set of 5 or 6.

I prefer Santa Fe for Moon's railroad game. As a train game (connection game), Trans America is much better than this. Something similar to Ticket to Ride that I much prefer will be Looting London and Marco Polo.

This is a great gateway game, because it's so simple and it appears to have strategy.  After a few plays though it gets old.  I tend to read a book or play another game while playing this game. In fact for the first 30 turns or so, I don't even need to be at the table for my turn. All I need is for someone to draw two cards for me since this is what I do for the first 30 turns or so. But non-gamers tend to think a lot and take a long time with their turns in this game.

RATING: 7
As an introduction to REAL board games, it knocks out Carcassonne and utterly destroys Settlers of Catan, but I prefer the slightly more complex (and less luck-heavy) European version.  The big problem with this one is that there's too much overlap in the destination tickets, making it too easy for players to pick up points they didn't really earn.

Julio 2008: Despues de jugar muchas veces TTR: Europe, pienso que esta versión es menos interesante. Hay muchos caminos posibles para cumplir los destinos, lo que lo hace menos tenso. Quizas esto mismo es lo que lo hace mejor como juego familiar, pero a mi no me gusto. Las locomotoras tienen poco valor y se acumulan sin usarse, exactamente lo inverso que pasa en la version Europe.
Jugado con la extension 1910.

Julio 2016: jugado con 5. Muchísimo mejor. Tenso, apretado, vale la pena. Me sigo quedando con Europa, pero con 5 este es más entretenido.

[b][COLOR=#66CC33]Pro:[/COLOR][/b]  The accessibility for this game is amazing. You could teach kids probably as young as 5 this game, and even people that are stressed out from a hard days work and don't want to do any thinking could easily learn this and strategize in it if they were willing.

[b][COLOR=#66CC33]Pro:[/COLOR][/b]   The artwork is great, the colors on the board are clear, even with city names and route tracks all over the board, the game never seems like a cluttered mess so much as a beautiful and busy system of railroads. Because this game deals with color, if you're colorblind, this game will be impossible to play.

[b][COLOR=#66CC33]Pro:[/COLOR][/b]  The area control really is a lot of fun. You can collect cards in your hand of the same color for a specific rail road and think you're safe. "Ha, who else would have six white cards in their hand, right? Yeah... that track is safe". Suddenly your mother throws done a single white and five locomotives, and instantly demolishes the effort you put in to your collection. It's actually joyously devious, even when it doesn't mean to be.

[b][COLOR=#66CC33]Pro:[/COLOR][/b]  There's a push your luck element, which I really love. You can grab tickets whenever you want, but not completing them will lose you points, and you have to keep at least one. You need to consider when you draw them. But if two of the ones you draw are kinda in the same area, maybe you want to keep both? But remember, if you choose both, over the course of the game, the board will change with people placing their tracks, and suddenly those two cities that were really close now have the straight pathway blocked, and you have to travel halfway around the country in a circle to get to it. This game constantly throws wrenches into your plan when other players start catching on to your movements (and sometimes, even by accident).

[b][COLOR=#FF0033]Con:[/COLOR][/b] This game is decent at 2, but really shines at 4. If I were to rate it based on my experience with 4 player games alone, it may be a 9 or even a 10. But getting 4 players together isn't always possible, and lower counts of this game make it a lot less tight.

[b][COLOR=#FF0033]Con:[/COLOR][/b] When you're drawing tickets, you are drawing blindly from the top of a deck. For this reason, you may get three cards that completely screw you over, especially in the last half of the game when tracks are placed everywhere. Then someone else may draw cards that fit their strategy perfectly. This is part of the luck of this game that I'm not a huge fan of, but it's not that big of a problem.

[i][COLOR=#33CCFF]Final thoughts:[/COLOR] Gateways and mass market games get a reputation for being either too simple or too random to be good. I think Ticket to Ride subverts that reputation. Yeah, there's some randomness in it, but I think that there's only just enough randomness to provide excitement, while letting strategy and some risk taking pave the way to success in most circumstances.

TTR gets a bad rap in strategy circles, but there is a subtle gamesmanship and timing that must be learned to compete with experienced players. 

It makes a great gateway too--I would likely bring this or Carcassonne out.

Quick and very enjoyable.  The risk of getting more tickets and trying to finish them creates a feeling of tension.  The game is better with the USA 1910 expansion, because the original tiny cards are a hassle to shuffle and plus you get more tickets and the bonus for risking the most as well.  It took me a long time to get and play this proven classic, and now I can see why it is well regarded as a gateway and simply fun boardgame.

I bought this game to play with my 4 and 5 years old kids, and it kind of work. They understand the mechanics but have trouble devising a strategy or even using basic tactics. In particular my daughter likes to have a diversified, multi-colour hand, which is a bit counterproductive. As for my son, he takes a locomotive whenever possible. Yet they manage to do reasonably well on points. It seems to me that the outcome is completely driven by destination tickets (the winner is the one who gets transcontinental tickets). This game is one of the few games my wife likes.

Board Game Hall of Fame!  This game, above all others, has introduced more of my friends and family to board games than all other games combined.  The ultimate "gateway game".

Probably one of the best family games ever.  I have 3 daughters and they have each asked to play it several times since we got it on Christmas.  Of course 2 of them only want to play because the other one has won EVERY game and they cant stand that.

Great gateway game and great overall game.

Ticket to Ride does a great many things well. It has simple rules: easy to learn, and easy to teach. Games are quick, taking about an hour to play. The game lets individuals build train networks (and building things is inherently fun), but it forces players to interact as players will place their trains in each other's way. There are genuine strategic choices, but there is enough luck to keep the game winnable for a wide range of players: the most strategic players will tend to do better but will not dominate every game.

All this makes it a game that appeals to a wide audience. I love playing this game, but I absolutely adore how I can play this game with anyone.

However, the original USA game is not my favorite. The cards are small. A few cities (like St. Louis and Charleston) do not have destination cards. Players dealt long east-west routes hold a distinct advantage over players trying to connect multiple short north-south routes. I strongly advise you to buy the USA 1910 expansion. It gives you larger cards, adds more destinations, and adds the most completed routes bonus.

Played this online and it was a lot of fun, but as a boardgame this one just isn't quite fast enough to merit the time investment.
It's okay as lightning fast, luck-based fluff, but just takes a little too long for the light fare that it offers.

An okay game, but stick with the online version.

Ticket To Ride is a good, yet childishly simple game. Its simplicity isn't a bad thing though; it is easy to teach. Play can be very fast if players don't overthink each turn as only one action is possible.

On our first playthrough a friend came up with a strategy that seems to circumvent the games intent: If a player does nothing but go for all the 6-car routes he'll make more points on average then someone completing tickets. If everyone were to play in this fashion then the tickets deck seems superfluous after the initial draw. After several games of testing, this method is a gamble: If other players haven't been snatching up the 6-car routes to complete their tickets, this strategy can pay off big. If the others have done so, then a player using this plan will have nothing more than a bunch of disconnected routes. If 2 people try the same method they will wind up with the lowest overall scores.

Oh, and everyone is right about the cards being way too small. The train deck as a whole is almost impossible to shuffle conventionally. Can't wait to get my hands on the Anniversary Edition!

One of the first games I got.  I believe this is the game that actually broke the mold for my wife and I.  It opened our horizons and left us wanting more.  I consider this game to be my groups original gateway game and I owe it a lot more than I give it credit for.

Players take destination cards that tell them what cities they need to connect by collecting train cards and matching sets of the proper colors to claim routes.  In the end players score points on the destination cards they finished, and the amount of trains they have on the board.

Fun game that is easy to teach and does not last too long.  Allows players to make some tough decisions without hurting the brain.

This game has a permanent spot in my heart as it was a birthday present from Zeynep. It's simple and light, it's very easy to learn, teach, yet very elegant in design, and most importantly it's always a crowd pleaser! A great gateway game that helped us introduce a few of our friends to modern board gaming. The game works best with four in my opinion, with two you get one of two scenarios: either both players fight for the same routes, which can get really annoying for both players, or players play on different sides of the board, which is just boring. Just for this reason alone I am thinking about getting an expansion for the game. We’ll see...

Note: This game has been played several times before I started logging plays.

RATING: 5
It's a game.  Not bad, but I will only suggest it if I know that I'll get declined for everything else.  Too chaotic and random for my taste.  I do not enjoy working intensely but blindly against the other player.  It has a little take that factor, but most of the time that is random (Oh, did you need Portland to Seattle? Sorry, so did I).  On the flip side, it is really hard to knock a game of which my family immediately purchased 4 copies.  Played mostly 2 and 3 player games.

After a week of playing a 5 player game every night, my feelings are the same.  If I want to impede someone, I want to do so purposefully.  If someone messes with me, I want it to be planned.  This just does not happen in our games.  BUT my family LOVES it!

Why this is not a 10:
-> I do not want to play this all the time
-> I feel like San Juan/RFTG has way more interaction than this game (which I prefer).
-> It feels like one draws a lot of cards, plays a bunch of trains, and sees what the score is
+ My family loves it so I get to play a game - Yeah!

A fun and quick game. Easy to learn. Enough strategy to be light and keep you occupied. The standard US map seems to have a basic solution. If you get a route from New York to Los Angeles, you're pretty much set up for most routes. Any time I've won, I've had a cross country route.

RATING: 8.2
Great gateway game, probably the best one (replacing Catan). Even if it's very simple, it's not likely I'd refuse a game :-)

It doesn't have an important strategic content, but you take meaningful decisions each turn, and the tension keeps building up during the game, as you fill the pressure to place your links...

3 and 5 player games can be mean.

My only critics:
-> In some games you are already doomed at midgame, without any hope of catching up.
-> The ticket Los Angeles - Miami is ultra-powerful, and usually means winning the game. Not only the 20 points, but the 3 6 wagon links provide 45 points, and there are not enough tickets to create competition for these links.

Simple design, great theme, lovely board and good components. Ticket to Ride is a good game but it lacks depth. Card drafting is in a big role, which is something I do not like. Luck, however, makes this game very exciting and frustrating at the same time. Ticket to Ride, I would say, is worth the hype: I have played a lot before I started to log my plays and I will play more. Originally my rating was much higher. Now I see there are better games available.

I am not much for family games.  I like Alhambra more than this, but one cannot deny this one being fun.  It's as fun as everyone says it is, but it's light.  Like feather light.  This game is the 'new monopoly' as far as that household name for a boardgame that anyone can play and own.

it has a fun theme and design and everyone enjoys laying down rails to expand their route.  The game feels interactive with the board and the players, but not so much to where the game is volatile or toxic [although I hear some maps can be hell].

Exactly a family game. Easy to teach. Fun to play. You can play it with not-experienced board gamers too. Be sure they will like it. As you know some people does not like board games. They can see how funny playing board games can be by starting playing with Ticket To Ride. You cannot teach detailed games to these people but this one is easy to teach. No in game language texts, good usage of colors, quality game pieces and board. Balanced game and great game idea is included behind. Every game is not won by same person but generally better one wins but not 100%. A bit luck is included and it effects winner about 30%. Of course you also have to use your brain. A totally stupid one cannot win any game. Can playable fast it can end in 40-45 minutes in average after you experience some. Great replability, you can replay up to 5 times in some days. All families should have one. 

Increased score 0.2 points after playing its IPAD version tons of time.

Again increased score 0.2 points after playing its IPAD version tons of time. At total 0.4 score is increased. What a deep strategy game it was. I could not realize it in my first 20 games. Now I win 90% of my games with using better strategies. I was thinking it was a luck based game at first. After playing nearly 150 times at ipad aganist worldwide opponents I understood game's mechanics totally. And this game is awesome. Both it is easy and deep strategy. Have a very good replayibility. In all cases it is a good game and a good design. Congrats Alan R. Moon!

But still I lose because of luck, bad cards, opponents build in my way suddenly sometimes:(

Deceptively strategic given the simple mechanics.
Has never failed to impress the "Monopoly" crowd. Even my curmudgeonly, chess-only-playing, mathematician, octogenarian friend likes this game (probably because he won the first time he played it).   
Have all the expansions and game-boards except Africa.  Wife loves the Nordic Country map.  My personal favorite is Marklin. Actually own three copies of the USA version (left at different places; mother-in-law's, cabin in the woods, home) A winner all the way.  You should own this game!

A great amount of risk vs. reward decisions in a short, non-threatening package. A touch too long for some casual gamers, and probably a few minutes too long for the depth of play.

I must also note that I absolutely adore the blocking, and find it hilarious how many people complain about the blocking element. That IS the entire game: trying to reach your destinations without tipping off too early where exactly you're going for. It's like a game of Twixt in that regard. If you can't handle a little competition and only want to deal with your own little farm/economy/castle without getting your feelings hurt, this isn't the game for you

Finally played the much talked about and highly rated TtR, bringing it home for a weekend with the family. Was surprised how enjoyable it was (having read the rules before, it appeared a bit too simple and "flat" for me.)  Turns out it has alot of appeal, and a very good set of critical choices per turn.

I must confess, there's just something deeply entertaining about laying out your lines of train cars. In my opinion the Destination Tickets really help define the game, as I prefer games with some hidden element to them, and the surprise win from filling out your DT's while also building high-scoring routes turns TtR from a thought exercise into a true pleasure of a game.  

Another very important point for me is that the game flows along very smoothly, with very little downtime between turns, as the "analysis paralysis" seems to stay at a low rate with only mild peaks every so often.

Finally, it appears this weekend was yet another definite confirmation that this game works fabulously as an introduction to the bigger world of board games for non-heavy-gamers.  My brother was frothing at the mouth to play it again and again all weekend, and even my mom was eager to play another game right after the first.

Very simple and extremely engrossing. Relatively quick(but the online version is, quite obviously, quicker) and always fun to play. Probably the best game to be introduced to a newbie.

I recommend getting the Ticket to Ride Europe edition as the board is more interesting (shorter routes, tunnels, ferries) than in this version. 

The original version has a terrible map, and is only interesting for those who refuse to play on a non-US map.

If your main focus is on the game mechanics, go for TtR europe.

It's OK to play with kids/the family. It teaches geography, &c. A couple fast games with adults were more fun.

RATING: 7
Another great game to get people into board gaming. It runs smooth and fast and there is very little downtime. We play with a house rule that gives you a little more time to select new routes and other people to continue playing as this always seems like the biggest downtime in the game. Just the right amount of competition without too much backstabbing for my tastes.

[b]Ticket to Ride[/b] was received in a trade (3/3/14). [COLOR=#FF0000]

A year later... thoughts and rating (10):[/COLOR]

[i]My family and I love this game, it is definitely a classic and in my opinion a must buy. This has also been a huge hit with extended family, my in-laws now have a copy and my dad really likes it. TTR has actually gotten more play as the months have rolled on. Everyone in my house loves this game and adding a new map was really fun. If I had to recommend one game to recommend to anyone, especially as a gateway game for family game nights, Ticket to Ride would be that game.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (9):[/COLOR]

[i]- Simplicity of choices: take trains, build routes, choose new route cards.
- My wife loves it!
- A very fun, relaxing game to play. (In the same vein as Finca and Takenoko)
Don't get me wrong, things still get tense when you think you have been cut out of a certain city, but usually you can find some way to get where you need to go.

We didn't play this game until we had been gaming for over 1.5 years. I was hesitant to get it because I thought we would find it too light, well I was wrong my whole family enjoys this game.[/i]

This was the first games we tried after being introduced to and hooked on Settlers. TTR was the one that further opened up this great hobby and good times to even more games!

Great game, very accessible and continues to entertain even with many plays!

This is a fantastic game and the US map is very easy (having been born and raised in the USA).

RATING: 8
I've had TTR:Märklin forever, and it seems almost nobody ever wants to play with the passengers. I feel like the passengers are necessary to help balance the east/west differences on the Märklin map, so I got TTR:US just to play with everyone who doesn't want to play with passengers.

As is nearly universally agreed, this can be a good gateway game to wean casual gamers off more traditional fare. Easy to learn and teach. Not exactly thrilling to play, it nevertheless offers interesting choices while not being overly difficult to grasp and does not take too long to play for what it is. It's easy to teach, easy to get into and has few rules--but a lot of strategy--blended with an appropriate amount of luck, especially in the ticket card draws. 

Purchased new, on sale, at B&N, 2011.

RATING: 8
(05/06/06)  Typisch zo'n spel waarin er weinig uitleg moet gegeven worden, en toch genoeg uitdaging biedt.  Een ideaal instap spel (naast de kolonisten van Catan) om iedereen kennis te laten maken met de wondere wereld der spellen.
De bedoeling in dit spel is om een aantal steden (kaart USA) met elkaar te verbinden.  Dit doe je door kleurkaartjes te verzamelen en op het gepaste moment te gebruiken om jou trajekt te bouwen.  Maar, wacht niet te lang, of anders ben je te laat en moet je soms grote omwegen maken om je opdracht(en) nog te kunnen vervullen.  Let op, alle opdrachten die niet vervuld zijn, zijn minpunten.  Wie er dan nog eens in slaagt om de langste route te bouwen, krijgt 10 extra punten.  (speelden mee: Danny, Dirk, Frederik en ikzelf).

RATING: 9.25
This is a great gateway game...no doubt. Fun, simple, and easy to teach and remember the rules. Strategic and intense at times too. This is the best of the TTR series...but only with the 1910 expansion! The expansion is a must...the better ticket selection improves replay ability!

Awesome game.

It's easy to learn, have fun, and be competitive in your first game.  The "better" player usually wins but it's still a blast to play with new players BECAUSE it's possible for them to win their first game.

Plays well from 2-5.  If I really had to search for a small complaint, the destination tickets can become too predictable .  Luckily there is TTR: 1910 that can be added AFTER you've played this a bunch.

If you are searching for a first game for yourself or someone else, this is a great pick.

Awesome game- I'll push my luck, a bit further, a bit further, yes, AAARRGHH I need that route, but now I don't even have enough trains to even complete my tickets... I'm so screwed!

Needs 1910. It's still good without it, but to be truly excellent T2R needs the expansion. 

The tension comes from the press your luck element. The more you build the more you empty your hand. If you have a big hand, you are threatening your opponents to potentially build anywhere. Hence you want to maintain a large hand for most of the game, keeping Jokers in reserve and using them last (I typically hoard them until either I'm desperate or to do a random 15 point build just before the end). Also draw face down cards early, and face up cards late. Most games I never take a face up loco.

It is best to go in cycles of "pick up, pick up, pick up, build, build, build" rather than "pick up, build, pick up, build, pick up, build" i.e. do as much building as possible in a short time frame. This reduces the window of opportunity for others to react to what you're doing in a way that harms you. However, this is where we reach the core problem of the game. The longer you wait before building, the more chance someone builds a key link before you.

This should probably be an eight, but I only played it online and have an irrational aversion to playing games with faceless online entities when I'm not very familiar with a game.

100+ plays across all its forms. It may be just card set collecting, but the map tension turns it into a great gateway game, likeable by gamers and family alike. Simple rules, simple game play, plenty of bated breath angst as you hope people don't claim your preferred track before you. Thumbs up.

A great game for intoducing people to German style games.  The best game I've seen so far for this.

Lighter than Settlers and Carcassonne, but still deep enough for serious gamers.  This is a great game.  Also, playing the game in 45 mins is also a plus.

Scales well to 4, but someone is always SOL with 5.

An adequate game, but overrated. Long with 5p (we took 120 minutes, with 3 first-timers). Enough blocking to be annoying, as the board is even more crowded than Europe. Complicated enough that two newbie still didn't understand certain aspects at the end, although they did ok (one of them came in 2nd).

Would not be my first choice as a gateway game. (Nor would Settlers of Catan, for what that's worth).

My first board game I purchased to get my wife to play more games. She doesn't have experience playing strategy based games so the simple structure of laying out train lines and earning points was easy for her to grasp.

Great game but the Europe version is better (paticularly if you live in Europe or you want it for educational purposes).

not bad, but I expected a simulation of some kind.
in this game, you don´t have to build  networks to connect cities, you don´t have to transport goods or passengers, you don´t even have to catch a train in time.
It´s quite abstract with these colour-coded tracks.
Apart from that it is a nice family game, some risk and tactical decisions involved (so, do I take another destination card or not?), but not too deep, and nearly no interaction.


seems overrated

All in all, Ticket to Ride is a great game for anyone. New or veteran gamer, it can be played by children as young as eight and would be a great game for a family game night. It may not be as in depth as some of the other games out there, but for a game that can be explained in minutes and introduced to new players with ease, it is a must in any game collection. After hundreds of plays, online and off, I still enjoy a good game of Ticket. Also, it plays very well at two players and at five, so it is very flexible.

I find that it's simpler to teach than Catan and has a lower luck dependency than Carcassonne. All three are games that I love but this is becoming my immediate intro game.

RATING: 7
Great game with the family. Never introduced it to someone that didn't like it, although it can wear out its welcome after a while.

Quite tense when you are trying to get those last few routes done. Usually in my group there is high demand for routes and the person that gets all the long routes that line up ends up winning.

Doesn't get played much recently except for 2 player, since my sister burned out on it. She too much enjoyed blocking people and she got a bit twisted when she was on the receiving end a couple times.

So far enjoy USA, Europe, and Nordic Countries. Looking to pick up a couple more maps but haven't yet, as the cost seems a bit high. Mostly play 2 player anymore.

1910 expansion is mandatory. Death to the baby cards!

Great at all player counts.

RATING: 8
The gold standard of modern gateway games.  Unlike a lot of other "gateway games," though, I still love playing it.  Wins are a little too influenced by starting ticket choices, but the better player still usually comes out ahead (or close to it), so it's not as bad as it could be.  Solid and fun.

RATING: N/A
Getting tired of it. My family wants to play it every time we get together. If you don't get the right cards, you're on auto pilot. I LOVE the alvin and dexter addition because it gives you some control over what's happening. But no one else likes it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Simple and clever gameplay, and is always a hit with new players. However the lack of depth on each turn can be frustrating if you've played it a bit. As can a few players being over-familiar with the ticket cards.

I'm not a huge fan but this is my wife's favorite game so I play it a lot. It is great for getting new people into games but I just find it boring waiting on them to agonize over their turns. The game takes way too long for something so light. 

26/10/13 bumped the score up because I was being too hard on it. It still isn't my favorite, I still think it takes too long for such a light game, but it is a fun play when you don't want to have to think too much.

RATING: 8
TTR got me into what I think of as modern boardgaming. simply collecting resources and marking territory by spending the correct resources allows you to complete goals. Resources are train cars of certain color,  territory is defined by rail paths, and goals are to two cities via paths. The real fun is trying to determine the path your opponent may be completing and claim those path segments to force your opponent to spend more resources.

Points are awarded based on all path segments and goals.

All-time best gateway game (heard that one before?). Bonus: the addition of the 1910 expansion will keep veteran players into the game even after repeated plays.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Incredibly easy to teach, yet possesses a great deal of long-term strategy and planning.  I find it amazing that such simple mechanics can provide such a deep and rich game experience.  This game is all about timing, you really have to be able to read other players and play the routes you want right before someone else does.  I'm not a huge fan of the elimination of double-routes in the 3-player game, as it really makes getting certain cities difficult.

Reminds me of Carcassone in many ways... Must play to block other players or else it's solitare. Simple components. Online play option is very cool... A great idea I would love to see others follow! 12/11/05: Not sure where this game fits in. Son has lost interest, and so have I. I think we've just played it out. Not bad, just not that interested anymore. 6/5/06: Okay, here's where it fits in. A good light-to-middle colorful Euro, great to introduce to newer gamers.

I need to try the USA expansion as this would add a lot to the rather bland base game?

One of the first games in my collection. The guy from my local game store always recommended it but I never fell for the 'train theme'. It turned out to be a lovely game and it got played a lot in the beginning. Learned me not to bother uninteresting themes and graphics on many euro games.

Nowadays it doesn't get played much because of the low interactivity with two players. Depending on the tickets you get in the game, you might never get in the way of the other player. Trying to mess with your opponent in a two player game is mostly a big guess work because there's so much alternative routes to complete your goals. Messing with other players works way better with 3+ players.

I'd love to try out the 'Nordic Countries' versionsbecause of the added mechanics but I must admit that it's on the lowest level of my wishlist. Playing someone else's game once might be enough to kill the itch. Ticket to Ride Europe is a much better game with the extra mechanics.

Great with newcomers to the hobby. Tried it once with five players; three where newbies that overtought their decisions which made such a nice a simple game drag for over two hours. Yuk.

More fun with three than two people.

RATING: 7.5
TRY Jan/05: Enjoyable 1st playing; felt to me like a cross between Empire Builder's route building plus destination cards & Union Pacific's face-up card options, track-to-map function, little train cars, and tension of build or not, with a little bit of TransAmerica mixed in.  I like it!  Soured a bit after more experience on the Days of Wonder website, where certain routes are definitely more useful to obtain early.

OWN Jun/07: I bought it along with the 1910 expansion, as I think that fixes the 'route knowledge' issue, since there are significantly more routes available.

Simple, repetitive, slightly dull at times and yet strangely addictive. 

I don't know if there really is that much luck in the game. In 9 games out of 10 the experienced player will crush the newbie. That is at least my experience.

(Everybody I ever played with seems to simply dismiss the theme: it's seems more fun to think your somekind of railroad company building infrastructure than just riding trains.)

We played this for the first time in December 2009 and didn't really get hooked, probably because it was a learning game and we didn't realize it. Then we played again in spring 2010 and somehow got very hooked. My husband and sister both really like this one. It's much better with the expansion, I think. I like the larger cards for easier shuffling and the new destinations. It's fun to use the little plastic trains, the board is pretty, and it's so simple and easy to teach.

6.5: Is a nice game, with super fast turns which is a huge plus. I'm always really tense and excited (in a good way), worrying other players take the routes I'm saving my cards for.

Possibly the BEST game for "first timers"! First timers being those that have NEVER played this game before, and those that have never played ANY games before. Each time I played was a whirlwind. It was most fun when we got in a rhythm and turns went by within a few seconds. And yet so much was happening on the board! While this will never be my favorite game, it might be my favorite introductory game and "30-60 minute" game for a long time to come.

Very good easygoing game. It is nice to have a game you can play within 5 minutes. The rules are simple, but the play can be more difficult than you think, because you can trouble your opponents a lot by adding the right track. And you can take a big risk by buying a lot of routecards. The game is more fun with 4 or 5 players and not fun with 2 (not enough intervenions)
It is very different from Catan or Puerto Rico, but a real nice alternative for a change!

This should be the poster boy for modern board games not eurocrap like Settlers of Catan. This is the only game that everyone I have showed it to likes.

Pros:
* Easy to teach and easy to learn.
* The theme works well.

Cons:
* Cards for the regular edition are too small.
* Routes are limited without the 1910 expansion.

I get to play this at a local board game meetup when I started this hobby. The only games I have played at this time was Dominion and Carcassonne. This is a light game that is easy to teach and play, but didn't hook me.

I feel the iOS way is better way to play this game.

---- Update ----
Got this game in a math trade after 1.5 years since my first face to face play. After I've started to get more experience in games this game is more fun than I thought. I've up the rating from 6 -> 7.

---- Update ----
Got my brother to play a 3-player game and this game is tense with a good player! I've upped my rating from 7 -> 8.

A game that will bridge the gap between hobby gamer and casual/family/friend gamer. All-in-all, an extremely simple concept that can be learned in a few minutes. But the gameplay is quick and engaging enough to keep everyone into it from start to finish. Sort of a classic now, it seems.

This is an okay game, but it takes a little too long with 5 players.  There is a lot of "secret" tension, where everyone sees a line and prays that no one takes it.  Conflicts eventually arise.  2 player game seems based on luck a little too much.  Using the Ticket to Ride Europe rules to even out the ticket distribution and selection makes the game more balanced...and fun. I always have good time playing this one (though I'd never choose it myself), so it gets a 6.

RATING: 9
Another modern classic. I know some people can't stand it for it's relative simplicity, but the pressure of increasing lines and the strategy of planning your routes can't beat. I especially love that when you're really behind there's always the last ditch effort of grabbing destination tickets and hoping they convert to points easily.

A classic. Just when I think I've out grown this gateway game, it's pulled out and I'm reminded just how great it is. The base US map plays very stress free with two players, but can get rather cut throat with five. I'd never turn down a game of Ticket to Ride.

One of the original Gateway games. I like the game and find a good deal of personal challenge in it. Try to do better than your last game with the hand provided--but it does suffer from competitive disadvantage. A person who plays it more will generally stomp a less experienced player. Doesn't see the table much as a result.

Simple to teach and a great "gateway" game?  Easy to teach, yes.  But I would not introduce anyone to the hobby with this dud.  Seriously brain dead as far as a game goes... draw a card, draw a card, draw a card, draw a card, draw a card, draw a card, draw a card, draw a card, draw a card, draw a card.  Don't see the appeal.  I'd rather play Sequence.  I'll still give Marklin or Europe a try, but I will not make it a priority.

Only have played on iPad (does that count?), and only then b/c there aren't iPad games of the type I enjoy. But man, is TtR addicting. There are decisions here about whether to go for long or short routes, and as to how late in the game you can pick another (quite late, in many cases). 2-player is a lot different than 4-player. As a sometime wargamer, however, I'll say it's lacking in theme.

An entertaining new addition.  After a couple of plays, I can see now what the excitement is about.  There's real satisfaction in connecting Chicago to LA.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Each player must complete a series of rail lines spanning cities based upon destination cards drawn at the beginning (and throughout) the game. Each destination carries points related to the length of the line, so a New York to Los Angeles line would score more points than Chicago to Boston. Incomplete destinations count against players at the end of the game, so completing them, even through circuitous routes is a must. The exciting part of the game comes from not knowing who is completing his or her lines, plus the ability to overlap lines, stymieing other players.

Game play takes between 30 and 90 minutes depending on the number of players and the speed at which they make decisions.

GAME PIECES

High quality throughout, the game includes:

- A fold-out board of the United States and southern Canada, plus a scoring track around the edge. The cities on the board connect through colored track lines, each line between one and six units in length.

- A set of destination cards showing lines that must be completed.

- Five sets of forty-five train pieces. Each player takes one same-color set of trains.

- A set of colored train cards that correspond to the colored lines that connect cities.

- Scoring markers that correspond to a player's train color.


Each player is dealt three destination cards in the beginning and must keep at least two. These form the basis for their lines. They also receive four train cards. To claim a line, players must create sets of the same color and number of train cards as the line connecting two cities. (The color of the lines has nothing to do with the player's train color, but the cards they have in hand.)

Each player, in turn, can perform one of three actions:

1. Draw two train cards per turn from either the set of five placed up for all players to see, or blind from the train card deck. (One card if one of the showing wild cards is chosen.)

2. Play a set of matching train card colors to claim a line between two cities.

3. Get dealt a new set of three destination cards, keeping at least one.

Players score points when they claim a line of track connecting two cities, the length of the track yielding proportionately higher scores. Scoring markers are moved around the 100-point scoring guide on the board perimeter.

When one player has laid all his or her train pieces, the other players get one last turn. Players then reveal their destination cards and add (or subtract, for incomplete lines) to their total. The longest continuous length of claimed track scores additional points, too. Highest point total wins.

Overall its a really fun game that can last a good amount of time.

Two plays.  Quite frankly, in spite of the beautiful pieces, I cannot imagine wanting to play this again unless I don't have a standard deck of playing cards handy.  Not enough decisions nor interaction of competitor play for my taste. But, like many others, I can see why it is well-regarded

Excellent game.  The rules are short and the game is easy to pick up.  The game is also short, so if things don't go well, you can play again.  There is some blocking others in the game, but not too much so that you are not thwarted for the entire game.  Plus, everyone is in the game, and you can't really tell who the winner is until it's all over.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Light, entertaining game. The mechanics are extremely simple: collect sets of coulored train cards in order to claim routes between cities and fulfill your objective cards (called "tickets") or deny your opponents' tickets. The longer the routes between each city and the harder the tickets, the more points you get.
Ideal for introducing non-gamers to the hobby or when you just feel like relaxing a bit.

Typical Alan Moon game, Not sure if that's a good or bad thing. Quick, tense, fun, and addictive play.  I wonder about these "destination" cards, seems like too much postive/negative points.  Works well with 2-players, but probably best with 3 or 4.  I tried it with 5, game can kinda drag.  The board, bits, cards, and illustrations are stunning.  My entire group LOVED it... much more than I did.  Rating went down after 3 plays, just nothing original with this game at all.

I played this a couple of times back in they day and wasn't very impressed with it.  I gave the IOS app a shot and I'm glad I did, I wound up playing hundreds of games.  When I switched to an Android phone I downloaded again and kept playing.  Dozens of hours spent playing this on my phone.

With an increased appreciation for the game I bought a physical copy and I'm glad I did.  Playing face to face is a lot different than on the phone and I've found I've had to re-learn the strategy.

Also, as is often noted, this is one of the best gateway games of all time.

An excellent game, I'm glad I gave it a second chance.

The problem I have with both editions is that there's an annoying amount of luck in which route cards you pick up, and there's little scope for strategic thinking.  There are some tactical decisions, which makes it worth playing.  But as gateway games go, there are others I'd rather play.

I find this game overly simplistic and frankly boring.  The decisions are not very interesting and frequently no-brainers.  I have no idea why people like this game so much.

A wonderful game. Simple to learn, but it keeps my family and me coming back for more, particularly when there isn't a lot of time for a "deeper" game of great length. I'm continually trying to refine my approach, but haven't played so often yet that I've memorized all of the possible routes on the cards...particularly since we've added the 1910 expansion. 

And it's got trains! Trains, I say. Fun bits with a "just one more game" flavor to it that makes me very happy I finally got this one.

Good, easy to learn and play.  Biggest problem is the prevelance of the long routes winning.  TtR: Europe fixes this.

Update:  After having played some games recently, I think this is just a twist of TtR that is a little more cutthroat.  There's some definite viable strategy since there are such dangerous implications of being cut off (i.e. no stations, many critical single routes).  I still think that some of the routes might be a bit overpowered and overemphasized (Houston-New Orleans & Nashville-Atlanta), but I upped it from a 6 to a 7.

RATING: 7
*I've revisited TtR because I love connection games and the geography lesson they throw in. Now that the hype has gone, I've warmed to the design though it will never surpass the charm of the distilled and less confrontational TransAmerica. 

The race to place trains on prime routes, enforced by the tickets, is a source of most of the tension in the minds of some, though the set collecting (coupled with the 3 wild discard rule) and risk taking in drawing additional tickets ratchets up the stress as well, (though I find the US map for 2 player is too 'open' so not as exciting). Yet I can see that such an adrenaline rich experience can also be a source of frustration, especially with more players. 

I appreciate there is alot more decision making involved here than in TransAmerica, such as when to wait and draw or when to lay track, or when to switch from picking tickets to getting all your trains on the board.

But the main reason TtR falls short for me is that it is too 'score' heavy, with the summing up of the tickets making the end too anticlimatic unless I can enforced the "reveal rule". 

Update: Recently played 7 games in 3 days, which included 3 newbies who play Rummikub. Definitely a good intro to the new breed of boardgames (as well as the series) which initially induces alot of tension, but this soon evaporates when played with 2 or 3 as there doesn't seem to be enough conflict for cities (will have to try the expansion). Rating for at least 4 players.

RATING: 7.5

Update 08/14/07: Reduced rating from 7.5 to 7.2. Because of the insufficient number of destination cards, particularly the long ones, after several plays the long destination cards become well known and it can become easy to guess an opponent's routes, thus blocking tends to distract from the game. TtR 1910 fixes this issue for the most part, although it introduces its own luck factor. A player may end up with several overlapping routes, giving him a big advantage.

Other than that:
Ttr is highly entertaining, fun, and full of tension. Offers the player lots of play choices, tactical and strategical moves, and risk taking. Great balance for such a multi-player game. Some compare this to TransAmerica, but this is a much better and deeper game with a much higher replayability factor than the one dimentional TransAmerica.

I have further comments about TtR here:

Most of the people there were not gamers and were'nt aware of a games like this. easy to learn and wonderfully strategic with 5 players crowding the board. Lots of kibitzing from bystanders.

My wife's favorite game.

Looking at my ratings it is obvious that this is not my favorite game.  

A good family game but lacks the interaction (i.e. screwage) I prefer in my games.  

I recognize the appeal, but this is not for me.

I like "light" games. I like strategic games. I like gateway games. I like family friendly games. I like games with player interaction. I like games where all players can feel they are never so far behind they cannot come out on top. And I like games in which there is luck, but long-term planning will generally win the day. 

TTR, to me, is all of these. 

Combine this with excellent components and a few beautifully simple and unique mechanics, and you have the closest thing we may ever see to an Everyman's game.

This was my gateway game, and I couldn't play enough. Now that I've moved on to games like Catan and Puerto Rico, I don't get the urge to play as often as I used to. It's still fun occasionally, and I always pull this out for non-gamers.

+Excellent gateway, modern classic. It's definitely light weight, easy to learn and satisfying for a wide age range. Light cutthroat/blocking, set collecting, route building. Good tension between early building or collecting, late game route building race.

This probably isn't a game I'll play over and over; either you rarely play board games and get roped into this once in a while and never progress or this is a stepping stone to many deeper more interesting games.

I'd put this on my cull list but the whole reason I got it was to have a good gateway on hand. It's really far too simple for me and plays too long for what it is. However, I am giving the iOS version a lot of love lately. It's a perfect implementation for this type of game and it plays in 5-10 minutes against the AI, which is the time investment I expect for something this simple. Still, it is yet another game to keep around for my son one day. 

EDIT: My rating is for the cardboard version. I would rate the iOS version a bit higher, perhaps a 7, just for playing faster.

This is the perfect gateway game to teach those who have only played Monopoly & Trivial Pursuit. There is a prodigious amount of luck--something that has purportedly been rectified with TTR-Europe. But then again I like a certain amount of luck--if you don't--stick to Chess. I much prefer it with two or three players--more than that and the game can become excessively long with tons of down time between turns.

RATING: 1
It nails the lack of direct conflict pretty damn well, since the only interactions with other players are via blocking routes or hoarding colors. And the game is structured so that destination tickets are always hidden information and colors in hand are usually partially hidden. Thus there is rarely enough information to deduce other player's objectives, and next to no strategic basis for ever trying to deny them those objectives in place of pursuing your own. There might be an interesting game of bluff and tells and reading opponents if not for the fundamental flaw that the game calls a point system. Not only is this so fiddly that the typical game will have most players with moves scoring as low as 1 point while the game end totals are usually in the triple digits, but that mere fiddliness was not enough needless complexity for the sake of avoiding the very conflict that makes a game interesting. No sirree bob, Ticket To Ride avoids the low-burn kingblocking of typical Euros like Settlers by making one hundred and ten percent sure that it is impossible to deduce the currently leading player at any point in the game. Destinations are usually the biggest component of a player's endgame score, and they are kept secret until the endgame, and everyone has several all the time. And if you don't complete them, they count negative. So not only is there no way to know any other players' actual score at any point where you could make a choice based on that knowledge, but there's not even a usual approximation based on averages from that hidden information -- you can't assume that the player with more Destination tickets in hand has a higher hidden component of their score, because they are just as likely to have additional negative points as positive points. 

This is not a train game, this is a train wreck of a game.

RATING: 5
A fine, if somewhat dull game. There's not much to it, either in the rules themselves or in playing off of the other players. The scoring track is pretty fiddly, as people often forget to record their points after playing a route. Another issue is that the endgame can come down to people who are hopelessly behind drawing random route cards and hoping to draw routes that they already have completed, which feels hollow and unearned. I would always rather play something else.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Fast set collecting card game successfully mounted onto a train theme. They were smart enough to put unique symbols on the cards in addition to the colors but then they failed to add the symbols to the map. They should have printed the scoring reference table in each corner facing out so all players could keep score to keep the pace up. This game definately works best if the pace is kept high.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Decent enough game. It's good in that it's easy to learn and easy to get non-gamers into at family gatherings and such. My main gripe is the card size. I have no idea how to shuffle them; it's always a mess. Ticket to ride is not a game I go to often but it is enjoyable enough on the times we do break it out. A solid 7.

Far more enjoyable than TransAmerica. Almost an 8 in 4 4-player game. Rating went up with four-players but the game wasn't played too cutthroat. Longer track segments are the way to go. Penalty for failure to complete routes is too severe.

I haven't won a single game; I think I'm so worried about making my connections that I don't have the patience to go for long segments and non-branching routes.

A classic gateway game. Every gamer should have one TTR game in his/her collection to introduce to new gamers. The USA map is definitely easier to navigate around because everyone is familiar with the destinations, but the game has serious balance issues. Certain routes are super important while others are never used. Everyone just ends up drawing to a huge hand size at the beginning. The tiny cards also suck. The 1910 expansion was made to fix some of these problems.

I generally like collecting and route building games - and this contains both features. Not in your face competitive - it is more of a race to make sure you get vital builds first.

Much more than the perfect gateway game (which it actually is, that's for granted)
So simple, so elegant, so exciting, so beautiful... we just love it as it is. Don't feel like getting any expansions or moving to any other train games.
After more than 100 plays, everytime we take it we end up playing it more than once.
Finally, I don't agree with so many people that consider it too light (not for real gamers). The rules and the mechanics are pretty easy, it can be great for kids (maybe 7+) and sure there's luck involved, but there's also plenty of strategy and tactics in TTR.

Not a great but not a bad game either. This is definitively one good familly game where chance plays an important rôle, almost has important has strategy. So even if you are not an experienced player, if you can get the right card at the right moment, you can beat anyone. Definitively spouce approuved for me.

Pas un grand jeu, mais en même temps pas un mauvais jeu. Définitivement un bon jeu familiale ou la chance joue un rôle tout aussi important que la stratégie. Donc même si vous êtes inexpérimenté à ce jeu, si vous obtenez les bonnes cartes au bon moment, vous pouvez alors battre n'importe quel joueur. Définitivement un jeu approuvé par ma conjointe.

RATING: 10
In the three years I lived with my non-gamer college housemates, this was the only one of the games I showed them that they legitimately loved playing. One of my housemates bought the Ticket to Ride app within a week and, at the peak of his obsession, poured six hours a day into playing online with strangers [not counting a few face-to-face games he badgered us into playing with him each night]. It's simple, it's fast, it's strategic, it's fun. I personally find other, more complex games more rewarding and based on my enjoyment alone I'd give it an 8 or 9, but I have to give it a 10 because it fulfills its purpose (introducing non-gamers to our style of games) so well. It's the perfect gateway game.

Edit: On TTR's tenth anniversary, someone posted the article on my Facebook wall, and all the non-gamers I introduced to TTR posted a bunch of comments about how awesome this game is and how much fun they have playing it. Keep that in mind next time someone tries to tell you that this game is "boring" or "not a true game."

Wondeful gateway game that people fall in love with the first time they play. Original game suffers a bit after many replays, but can still be made fresh with a few tweaks to the initial ticket distribution (i.e. make players distribute one of their tickets to other players). Subsequent versions are richer in gameplay and also great gateway games. One the top games to give as gifts as it's very well received.

I can't really add a whole lot to the volumes that have been written about this game.  It's not bad, and it's great for introducing folks to modern board gaming.  The low rating is a result of situations where there is too much luck involved.  If people are only focusing on their own routes, the winner is almost randomly determined.  The game gets better when people are a little more confrontational, but then you run the risk of someone who is alone on part of the board cruising to victory.  Well, there are far worse ways to spend an hour.

Not a bad game by any account, but considering this is one of the most popular gateway games I did expect more of an intriguingly designed game with some irresistible finesse, a la Settlers of Catan or Carcassonne, two games which are simple, yet ingenious. But Ticket to Ride is more or less nothing but the collection of coloured cards and playing this cards as soon as you accumulated the target number (the higher the better). Throw in the whole kerfuffle about train routes and the ability to 'block' other players and you have yourself a boardgame. It works alright and is not bad but I feel that the game is not more than the sum of its parts and it does not click with me.

I dislike card drafting games, especially games of this length, and especially when you're faced with a choice of drafting or playing.

I also dislike that kind of choice because drafting feels so much more insignificant than laying down "track." I want to do something "interesting" every turn.

Great family game! Kids love it and we sneak in US geography (European too when we play the Europe expansion set) while playing. The 1910 cards are bigger which I like - wish there would be larger cards offered for the basic and Europe sets too. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
The game is fun to play.  You get three cards with to and from destinations.  You build your line trying to connect as many of the destinations as possible.  If you connect destinations listed on the card you get the points on the card.  You also get points for destinations in between while trying to full fill the card.

RATING: 7.5
Great gateway game.  Played with non-gamer relatives/friends. It has been highly praised by all of them.
I like it but was too simple and unbalanced.  Also, Playing with less than 5 was too easy - everyone always gets almost every destination.

I would rate it 6.8 after playing T2R:Europe, but it gets bonus for gateway appeal and ease of teaching.

The worst thing is that it becomes a little bit repetitive.

While not my all-time favorite boardgame, it does get a tie for my all time highest ranking.  This is the quintessential "gateway game" I use to introduce my friends to the joys of the boardgames they played in their youth... and to illustrate the variety of games that are out there today, relative to when we were growing up.  Truly, this is a landmark boardgame.  Excellent design.

RATING: 8
Pros:
1. Easy to teach. This game can be taught about 5 minutes.
2. Fun to play. The game has a good mix of luck and strategy. Making a great game to play with new gamers.
3. Plays quick. This game plays in less than an hour.

Cons:
1. Set Strategies: There is a clear strategy to this game that can give you the upper hand. Experienced players who know this will easy beat any new gamers. It also makes the game boring as once this is figured out, there's not a large reason to play.

Summary: This is a game that should be in every house. Everyone should toss their copy of Monopoly and replace it with this game. I have literally not played this game with somebody who didn't like it. Buy it and play it, you will get your money's worth.

My wife loves this game! She actually pesters me continuously to sit down and play this game. I do feel this is a very good game for one with a light weight level. However, I'm close to buying the expansion because after playing so many times the routes are becoming too familiar. However, this plays very differently as a two player game than as a multiplayer game.

I have played this game with my niece at least 6 or 7 times just this past week. I have also played it with a few adults who aren't very interested in games and it has gone down quite well. Some people might think that it is boring because it isn't a "proper" train game, whatever that may be. There isn't a lot of heavy strategy going on in this game which is nice. Sure there are a lot of ways to connect the different routes, which adds a little to the strategy. Do you try to play in an obvious manner and claim routes in a line, or are you a little sneaky, and try to hope that it all coalesces towards the end of the game? I can imagine that with more players it would become quite intense as there are more players potentially competing for the same routes. 
Sure there is a little downtime while everyone is just taking two (or one if you get the up facing locomotive!) cards. However, in this game you can really crush someones dream. I had to laugh at my niece because she would always celebrate when she got certain cards, and I would think that was funny. If you lose friends over playing a game like this, then maybe you should look at the type of company that you keep? Seriously, if your friends cannot take losing in a game as simple and light as this, then maybe that does say more about you than the game. Overall, I really like this series of games. I think it would appeal mostly to children and non-gamers. I would consider this game as a great gateway game for kids who have only played Cluedo and Monopoly.

From a gateway-accessibility angle, it is easy to recommend TtR for American non-gamers. [b]One of the best (if not THE best) gateway boardgames.[/b] Stay away from TtR:Europe for American beginners, due to the weirdness of the European cities for Americans.
I can't decide which is the better game, between TtR and TtR:Europe. Each has strengths. I'd rather have TtR:Europe with more hardcore gamers, and TtR with family/non-gamers, I guess. And since family/non-gamers is where this series is aimed at (IMO), I conclude that TtR is the better game at succeeding with its target demographic.
TtR is a hard game to 'play down' on, and unfortunately usually leads to 1st-time players getting blown out, points-wise.

RATING: 5
I feel like there isn't enough interaction in this game to make it much of a game at all. It feels more like a "hope you draw the right cards" game than a game of tactical rail placement. I liked Railroad Tycoon much more for this reason.

RATING: 9
While I wouldn't call this a party game, I feel it goes best with party gamers. Highly enjoyable. The other 2 versions are alright, but the original is still my favorite. Haven't played any of the "other" boards.

I have no idea why there are so many people that think that having big cards makes the game any better.

A nice enjoyable game, but the version for Europe is better (which is good, since it's the sequel to this one).  NO WAY can you "learn the rules in just 3 minutes" -- that's baloney.  (Games played with the Mystery Train expansion are recorded there; without it are recorded here.)

There is more to this game than just being the first to race from one city to the mext, or from coast to coast as one does in other train games (TransAmerica). That is not enough. You also must be willing to do other things to win, like take on more routes to complete or potentially fail, and making the longest train route.  And you can't just finish your objectives to win, you still must trigger an end of the game by someone having 2 trains or less remaining on their turn.

This is the family game that has added bonus of actually being good..brilliant. Everybody likes this game,easy to inflict on family members..so thats what gateway means.
UPDATE 
What I like about this game is you can introduce this to anyone (read non-gamer) and they will play the game and warm to it.
while this game is essentially quite simple in design it really punches above it weight with some addictive game play. Can be quite cutthroat and endings feel quite tense as you risk getting more tickets towards the end.

fun game that is short, fast, and slightly addictive. easy to teach and learn. worth some of the hype for its accessibility and playability. not the greatest game ever, but potentially will be regarded as a classic. i've enjoyed every game of this i've played so far. hopefully this game’s success will spur bigger game companies to produce better games.  

Update: i've played this game enough that i might be reaching the point of diminishing returns. hard to say, will have to revisit my opinion of the game with my next few plays.

update:nah, the game is still pretty fun. the only thing is i have so many other games i haven't played as much as this one, so i've been trying to get those on the table and ticket to ride kinda fell on the back burner. busted it out and it was pretty fun. i wish the route ticket distribution wasn't so random, but whatever.

This game was one of the first I played after being introduced to gaming. I can't over stress what a great gate-way game this is. The mechanics of the game and the strategy are easy to pick up and the game's dynamics vary a great deal with every new player added to it. The best part of the game is the odd sense of satisfaction a person gets from laying down some track and completing a route. The game is a real motivator for the OCD crowd.

VERY EASY TO PLAY. I'm talking about 1 page of rules here. Yet the possibilities of the route goals are amazing. I want to play this again and with more people. One thing I'm afraid of is that the cards are so small, which makes finding cases impossible. Also, due to the large amount of cards in one stack, it is hard to shuffle.

It's got a lot of good things going for it. It's really easy to learn, the artwork is bright and interesting, America is easily recognizable and it fits up to 5. It's just that I realized that 90% of the game is just drawing 2 cards. It just takes so long to get little done in this game. It's not particularly good with 2 players as well. I mean you will only get to use 1 of the 2-sided routes, but there just isn't too much blockage there. If they could have made the game end quicker, I'd be happy for it, but as it is... it's too long to be doing something not interesting such as drawing 2 cards each turn.

My first play of Ticket to Ride did not go well. I was stuck with only cross-country tickets and quickly blocked off from easily achieving any of them. I think Alvin & Dexter might give this game some much needed confrontation, though my main problem with the game might be the way Tickets are handled. There seems to be a problem with a runaway leader as the person who gets the best tracks seems to be able to draw tickets that instantly score. It doesn't help that those who are blocked from completing their goals must also suffer negative points as extra punishment. It's not a bad game, it just supports the worst kind of luck. Though I must say, even after getting thoroughly walloped, I had some fun with Ticket to Ride. It's fast and colorful with a sort of charm I can't really define.

Sort of a competitive, colorful TransAmerica; plays light, moves fast and sometimes hinges on luck-of-the-draw, although consistent card collecting will get you what you want. Finish your route cards early and grab at least one other, to heighten your odds of victory. Forget about building the "longest railway"; the ten-point bonus won't put you in any kind of solid-win position. A fun game, just slightly longer than your average filler.

First play with the kids (5 & nearly 7) and Im happy to report they loved it.  Played an open game with tickets and trains on show all around.  But was very impressed they hardly needed any coaching to figure out what was going on.  Superb :)
Update: my 5 year old daughter wins virtually every game we play and I have no idea how she manages it.

Ak I find this game so frustrating.  Even the tension I find annoying, although I can see why so many people like it.  Plus there's nothing like finally completing that long route.  The "take tons of route cards at the end of the game" mechanic is a bit broken in my experience though...

Wow! When I first played this one, early in my boardgaming career in January 2005, I couldn't understand what the fuss was about. Was this really the game that drew so many to the hobby, that some people played dozens and dozens and dozens of times and couldn't get enough? Bah. Fast forward to two years later: Thurn und Taxis & the Marklin edition of Ticket to Ride had recently won my heart, so I decided it was time to give the original TtR another chance. Although the simpler mechanics seemed somewhat bland after having playing TtR Marklin, guess what, I liked this one best! The passenger mechanics make Marklin a more complex game, sure, but they don't add all that much fun in return for making the game more difficult to manage and harder to absorb.

This is a train game completely devoid of any economy. You build trains by first collecting cards (fixed amount each turn) and then just place them on the board. In essence it is only set-collection and route-building. In my view not  really interesting, but it is quickly explained and played and appeals therefore to a wide audience.

RATING: 6
My opinion of the seminal favorite, TtR, dropped dramatically after I finished my second play. The game offers little to nothing in the strategy or tactics department, and it heavily repetitious once you've finished your first game. The three-player game offers lots of opportunities for nasty blocking, but the game never gets confrontational enough for this to ever become a viable strategy. The game really boils down to set collection of the most tedious kind. A pretty big disappointment for me.

There are different strategies, a good mix of luck and strategy, great player interaction, good bits (apart from the small cards but 1910 solves that).

One of the best gateway games, equally fun for beginners and experts alike. Mission cards allow you to control risk (being thwarted, not getting the right cards) vs. reward (victory points).

I bought it as a way of bringing my wife and me into "real" gaming.  Folks suggested it as a "gateway game" and those folks where right on the money.  Great game for us, including my 8 year-old daughter.  And defintely a hit with non-game playing friends.  So easy to learn and beautiful to look at as well.

Update (Feb.'09): No doubt this is the best gateway game.  We've had it for 3 or 4 years now and it never fails.  A favorite of my study hall and h.s. boardgaming club.  Got students who play a bunch online now too.

P.S. 1910 cards are almost manditory for fans.

Update June '09: Moved rating from "9" to "8" b/c I'm just not crazy about playing it these days.  For trains, I'd rather play Steam.  Still love it (with 1910 cards) to show to new gamers though.

Too long to play casually, and the optimal strategy in this game involves a) building long tracks, and b) figuring out what route cards everyone else is building, so you can then build the ones they aren't, and then draw the cards for them. I'm not willing to memorize the route card deck.

Ticket to Ride for me is the ideal gateway board game.
It's a great introductory game that provides just a flavour to non-gamers of what is both fun and challenging about the hobby.  
The mechanics are simplicity themselves, you have a set amount of track.  You have destinations to join up on a board.  You need to collect carriages of matching colours for each station hop of the journey.  Whilst there are expansions and twists to this, that's the basis of the game and you have to love it for that.

I'm not much into "family" games, and merely tolerate them for the 2 or 3 times a year when I'm required to play them with the family (well, my wife and her parents). But this one surprised me a little - without being in any sense a great, or even a particularly good, game, it exceeded my expectations. I even feel it could get quite vicious when playing with fewer players (much like Carcassonne), with players going out of their way to block each other, but that's unlikely to happen in a friendly family setting ;)

Gin Rummy on steroids. I actually like the train theme and the twist on gin rummy is awesome. You have to make matched sets of cards, but you have to make the right set and you've got goals you're trying to complete...oh yeah and you can probably figure out what everyone else's goal is too and you can either work towards your own goals or screw someone elses' up.

The best way I can describe the emotional impact of this game is: mounting tension.

Each turn you have to decide between:
* Do I try and get more cards to make more/better sets or claim what I can now?
* Do I claim that route before someone else does?
* If I claim that route, will it give me away?
* Do I claim a route that I don't need because I believe that someone else does and it will screw them up?
* Do I risk going for more destination cards or not?

No matter what you choose, you're worried about what you're opponents are thinking and what they're going to do next and if you chose the right thing or not. Great fun! The only down side I can think of is the setup and cleanup take a smidgen longer than a normal game.

Ah, I still remember my first time playing this game. Great fun at the time, but as soon as I bought Ticket To Ride: Europe, it was wiped off the map!

(9/22/07) - [8] - Rarely played anymore now that TtR: Europe is here!

(02/11/14) - [6] - My tastes have changed over the years, and Ticket to Ride has fallen victim. I don't particularly enjoy playing this much anymore. I'll bring it out as an introductory game and hope that I don't end up too bored with it.

Ticket to Ride is a pretty decent game. At the heart of it, it is a resource acquisition/placement game. But it does have a fun amount of strategy that goes along with it.

Depending on the amount of players, early turns can be dull. I rarely see any better strategy than stocking up on random cards for a number of turns. This can change a little when playing with 4 players - if other players start playing on Central European routes. Denial is a HUGE strategy in this game! 

The game is really designed for 4 players. 2 players gives too much space so there is little competition for routes. 3 players can, likewise, be a quiet game. 4 players is where this game is experienced best.

This is also a great game to introduce to non-gamers, as it is very easy to pick up and learn.

All in all, a very solid game that I do like to play!

DOW version - This was actually purchased by the Wife (Her first game purchase!).  I didn't hold out much hope, but... Surprise, surprise! What a great game! Incredibly easy to learn but there's still a lot of underlying strategy.  Great interaction between players.  This one will definitely be seeing a lot of play for a while!

RATING: 7
Though I modestly enjoy the game, my high rating is really due to the enthusiasm it has generated amongst my non-gaming peers.  Ticket to ride has been very well received by almost everyone to whom I have introduced it.  The best is watching everyone tap their fingers nervously, biting their nails, trying to hide their disappointment when they are getting blocked.  There are a number of ways to win the game, and you can play a very defensive, interactive game if you like.  I probably have the same level of enjoyment from this as from carcassonne, though the emotions ticket to ride generates in others have been more fun to watch.  EDIT:  never mind about being able to play a 'defensive' game.  Even if you have a very good guess as to what your opponents are doing, hurting someone else hurts yourself nearly as much, as time is ticking for you to complete your task!  Still a good, tense game, though strategically a little limited.

RATING: 7
Update 11/6/2017 - Upped my rating. Sometimes, you just want to lay trains with family and friends. TtR does it best.

***

To date, I've played Ticket to Ride multiple times, across four TtR maps: USA, Europe, Nordic Countries, and the updated Marklin map now Germany. TtR is pleasant enough fare for family gaming, and it certainly elevates itself in those scenarios, but the natural competitor in me just turns my nose up at the randomness sometimes. It is married to every aspect of the game, and when it burns you, it burns bad. When games that I spend time with retain this amount of unmitigated randomness, I want them to be quicker, leaner, or else possess means to address it. The Nordic Countries map allows for that, thankfully. 

At the end of the day, I recognize and respect that this is Alan Moon's intent in his design, and he has, without question, succeeded marvelously. While I am not clamoring to play it, in most situations, I will not turn down a game. It is a fine diversion when not taken too seriously.

If I had to pick a favorite map, it would be Nordic Countries, by a long shot. The overall aesthetics and the map layout of that one is, I think, superior to the others, as it creates more moments of head-to-head route competition. However, the other maps are similar enough (and in the case of the USA map, less interesting enough) that I think it is fine to rate the games similarly, as an average of my ratings, for what is essentially the same type of gameplay across all maps.

(+) Truly a classic example of elegant, accessible game design
(+) Modular mechanism lends itself to various scenarios with potential for more interesting gameplay (new maps, new expansions, slight adjustments in rules)
(+) Plays quickly, and smoothly.

(-) Gameplay can be uninteresting and repetitive.
(-) Depending on the route distribution and/or number of players, the amount of player interaction can be less than I like.
(-) Randomness abounds with no way to mitigate it (TtR Europe 1910 expansion has station cards that are a neat idea towards addressing this issue)

We've really enjoyed playing this, but at times it doesn't seem to have enough going on.

I had high hopes for this game.  At this point I actually like the on-line version more than the board game.  Too little interaction for me.  It's great if the kids are not yet asleep since it keeps things quiet.  Feels like X player solitaire.  Cool concept; just too little interaction for my tastes.

Edit 11/07: I can certainly imagine this game being unendingly fun with the right (read: cutthroat) group.

Nice tension of waiting another round to collect more cards or playing now to get that route.  Some decisions about where to play also - balancing the need to extend my routes while hindering others.  If played briskly, a very enjoyable game to play.  About the only downside is the constant score-keeping - but even that can be minimized by scoring everything at the end as the routes are all on the board for confirmation.

RATING: 5
The basic mechanic is similar to rummy, in that players use cards to try to make colored sets.  As they make these sets, they build their rail network.  Players score points for meeting game requirements unique to each player.  The player with the longest rail line receives a bonus at the end of the game.

Ticket to Ride is well-suited for introducing non-gamers to gaming.  A very simple and short game with low-level strategic decisions, it's a good choice for families with kids.

Bumping up the rating to an 8 on the strength of replaying with the 1910 expansion.  I think I'd burned out on the regular game.  I'll happily play any iteration of Ticket to Ride most days - though I'll insist on adding 1910 to the US map to minimise the "luck of the draw" problem with the coast-to-coast tickets.

A great gateway game, as cliched as that sounds.  If you have younger children or non-gamer friends that you want to introduce to the hobby, buy this game.  Fun but with a definite tactical element.  Really needs the 1910 expansion to overcome the tedium of shuffling those teeny cards.

31-05-2014. Rated after 2-3 plays. I dislike Ticket to Ride. You draw goal cards with routes that you aim to connect on the board, that each consists of several (at least 3 I guess) short pieces of rail. Tricksy is that often the routes can be connected just by 1 or 2 people and if you're unlucky you have to connect take a detour. You accomplish this by collecting sets of cards (of a certain color) in order to build similar colored routes on the board to obtain your objective. While the game is NOT bad, it doesn't click with me at all. I would agree that it's a good gateway game, but one which I desire not to play.

With only three choices each turn, TtR is a great game to bring out when you have new players looking for some fun. About an hour long for four players, each player tries to build routes from one North American city to another. There are a couple of tricks you will learn after you play a few games but the difference between new players and veterans is not that pronounced, making this game enjoyable, balanced and a lot of fun. There are lots of expansions to keep game play original and enjoyable.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
The game almost looks too simple, but the mechanics are elegant.  You want to own routes between cities, but it takes time to build up matches of the same color cards to "buy" those routes.  Shorter routes are easier to buy but give less points.  And there is also the risk and reward of taking on the challenge of trying to aquire specific routes by the end of a game, for a big reward or penalty depending on whether you got it.  Another game where you can only do a limited number of things each turn and you are constantly weighing short term small gain against taking risks to build up resources to buy  big point routes.

RATING: 4
With 2 players..."blah". After so many plays a 2 player game holds little appeal pre-game and provides little fun during the game.

With 4-5 players...more fun, though still not something I enjoy or appreciate. I can deal with the lack of theme and themeless mechanics with more grace when I play with 4-5 players than with 2 players. The game is much more competitive & the board is so much tighter. Highly recommended as a 4-5 player game for new gamers, light Euro gamer types, and Ameritrashers who can suspend their need for theme and blowing things up (which means you're likely not an Ameritrasher!).

Caveats: 
(1) This game is a great game for gateway gamers and gamers who like lighter fare.
(2) This game has no theme, in my opinion. That really drags down its rating. If being immersed in theme or an excellent integration of theme & mechanics is important, proceed cautiously or don't proceed at all.
(3) The 2 player game is competitive but lacks important tension, as the map is generally so wide open. I would rate the 2 player game very low, say a "4".
(4) Played with 4-5 players, the competitive nature of the game more than makes up for most of its shortfalls.

Final verdict: It will not be my first choice, even with 4-5 players, unless there are no other sensible options. But if someone else suggests a 4-5 player game of TTR, I probably won't have a problem playing and will likely enjoy the experience. As a 2 player game..."blah".

After enough exposure to the board gaming hobby, my fascination with Ticket to Ride has abruptly come to a halt. Like many lured into playing a game from this franchise, I believe my initial attraction to TtR was due to the snazzy components, and the hype surrounding the game. After enough plays, it completely baffles me how anyone can enjoy this (base) game.

In general, I dislike train (economic) games, but that doesn't matter because TtR is not really a train game. It's a hybrid set collecting/route building game, both are genres I quite enjoy. It would seem that TtR should have been right up my alley. I bought the game with high expectations, but even the first play fell somewhat flat. 
There seemed to be almost no player interaction in our games, except for some accidental blocking. It became a game of draw a card ad infinitum. Then I tried looking for some strategy to be found, but it's almost non existent. Even blocking strategies are almost never worthwhile.

I kept this game around as a possible gateway, but I've since decided against inflicting this drudgery of card drawing, route claiming on anyone. There are so many better gateway games out there, I'd stay far away from this one. It's a shame really, because maybe the Marklin edition is a much better game, but I will not bother to find out.

This game never gets old to me. I enjoy playing with my family, and I have not introduced it to a new gamer that didn't like it. Even with first time players, most of the time it's not obvious who won until end game scoring, which really keeps everyone invested in the game from start to finish.

Very good game.  Simple and easy to learn.  Easy enough for beginners and non-gamers.  Yet still hold a little strategy.  Great gateway game.  Always played with an expansion.  Most often played with 1910 and sometimes the Mystery Train.

RATING: 5
Fun, lighthearted game.  Unfortunatly, lack of strategy caused me to lose interest in Ticket to Ride over time.

If you don't complete your destinations (connecting 2 cities with trains) you lose points.  Therefore, the internal question of "should I go for those extra points?" is the real hook here.  This sense of urgency is neat but becomes boring over time.

Still a fun game that I would play from time to time.  Very popular with gamer and non-gamer friends alike.

--Apr2006-- Upgraded back to 7; it's way too easy to play and explain not to be a 7.  My 6 year old has developed a fascination for it, too - and her enthusiasm makes the game more fun.

This is a fairly simple 45 minute game.  Like Trans America with some set collection and blocking people out.  I think there's some other 45 minute lighter games I like more, but this is a favorite of many of my friends, and I'll play it when it hits the table, even though I'd usually rather play something meatier or a different 45 minute game.

The first time I played this game I wanted to play it again as soon as I was finished.  To me, that's the mark of a good game.  Kudos to Days of Wonder for making an online version to play.  I've been playing solid for a few games and really enjoy the mechanics, the strategies, the feeling that if I played over and over with the same people the game would just get deeper and more interesting.

Right next to Settlers as a key gateway game for me. Ticket is a little more family/kids-friendly than Settlers. This is another game that one of my sons is a back-to-back WBC Juniors champion of. My middle daughter has a plaque too. :)

An absolute classic, it's what you bring out for your non-gaming friends.

Think of it as an abstract game, and not a "train" game, and it's great. Europe is the best variant, although we find India interesting, especially with the European Stations rule.
1/2/16 update: We have printed off all possible tickets, excluding single line tickets, from spreadsheets found via Boardgamegeek for Germany, USA, Europe, Nordic, and it breathes a whole lot of new life into the games. Endless variety, and we wouldn't want to play it any other way now, and will be playing lots more!

[color=#CC0000]

The mechanics of the rules are super-simple, super-tight, and just a whole lot of fun.  A problem arises with two players -- one may choose to do nothing but block the other, which becomes a bit tedious.  I recommend three or more where that strategy won't pay off.

You can teach this game in five minutes.  Then the fun begins.  This is a must-own game.

Personally, I think this game is broken, but still fun to play in spite of its flaws.  I generally love Days of Wonder games, but this one falls short because I have found that the best way to win is by going for the biggest railroad pieces and not worrying about the tickets.  That's right, build all the six piece lengths for an amazing 15 points each turn instead of taking a ton of turns to connect cities by building in the 1 or 2 slot spots.  Those smallers slots burn up turns without producing much bang at the end when completing the ticket.  Some might argue with me, but I have won the last few games easily by employing this strategy.  And even when players think they can beat me when they know that I am using this strategy by collecting and filling out tickets still come up short in the end and lose.  Like I said, this game is broken.  Maybe the other expansions fixed this issue - I don't know because I have never played them.

Thoroughly enjoyable and good for families/mixed settings.  Good party game, as well.  Colorful, high quality bits (trains are a bit cheap, but not unforgiveably so), as we have come to expect from DOW games.  Highly replayable, short, challenging, and fun.  Gets a bit repetitive but it's a good starter or filler, and has a high "wife appeal" factor. And that's not a bad thing :)

I prefer light confrontational Ameritrash "beer and pretzel" games, so, not surprisingly, won't play this game again.

[b]Caveat:[/b] I’ve only played this as a 2-player game, my :thumbsup: and :thumbsdown: are based on that.

:thumbsup: I get why this is popular as a gateway game. It's easy to explain, but doesn't feel like a brainless waste of time once you're playing.
:thumbsup: A fun blend of different 'push your luck'-factors. [i]"Am I going to draw cards or play cards? And if I'm drawing cards, will I draw from the deck or from the open cards? What are my opponents up to?"[/i]
:thumbsup: As can be expected in a Days of Wonder game, the components are top notch.

----

:thumbsdown: Does the game 'grow' with its players? Once a player has (partially) memorized the different tickes, can he easily predict and thwart the routes other players are trying to connect? I.e. does Ticket To Ride get more interactive with more experienced players?

The base game is ruined by the strategy of hoarding cards and going for long tracks and mostly trying to block other players, rather than going for any route cards.

Takes too long for how many interesting decisions are made. "I'll take a card and pass..."

What little player interaction there is is often one player unintentionally screwing another player over.

Moderately Accessible Light Euro 

THe original (+ all the expansions)! Elfenland on rails. I stank at this for many years, delightedly so, forming vast strategies of networks which would crumble upon contact with the enemy. Attempting a convoluted track structure to complete all routes simultaneously--so fragile that a single opponent link could destroy 3, 4, 5 routes at once. That I would always lose didn't bother me, but at some point, say 5-6 years in to our playing, my wife went on a kick of mocking me for my TtR failures. 

I've cautioned her against such actions, as my fragile male ego can only take so much pressure before it butsts like the proverbial dam and I start calling in sick from work to study game strategies and play simulation scenarios for 12+ HOURS AT A TIME. (oops, accidental caps lock)

the result was what it usually is, of course--we no longer are able to play this game 1 on 1. I think tears actually sprang to her eyes of shock the last time we played Swizerland, I was able to deduce and crush her plans so thoroughly. Add it to the list with Blokus, Quoridor, any trump game, Ingenious, etc. etc.

The thing about me is that I'm not particularly good at new games to start--I'm pretty terrible, actually! and people find this amusing because of my reputation. I don't mind losing for...well, forever, if the game is amusing, but if I get too excited about the game or they make fun of me too much, they learn where my rep (and competitive games record) comes from! I learn games like a demon possessed, when I change mental and emotional gears to uber-competitive mode.

The funny thing about my wife is that she knows this but doesn't really care, it's somehow STILL WORTH IT to be able to mock me mercilessly, rub losses in my face, even though knowing it will result in us not being able to play a certain game together in the future. She likes goading me, knowing I'm helpless before such barbs, that I'll have to ramp up and crush it. She's a keeper--I think that's pretty funny too.

Bought this game for a friend.  Components are beautiful.  Completing a long route can be very satisfying.  Sometimes you need to create very convulted routes to hook up your cities.

RATING: 7
Visual Appeal: (4)
The game board looks very nice. The routes are easy to read and have colorblind assistance. Box art looks like every other train game, but a little less serious. It almost hints at having characters although the game itself features none. 

Components: (4)
The original game comes with tiny cards which is really the only thing that I hate. There's no reason for it since there's plenty of room in the box for full size cards. I use the 1910 expansion cards now. The trains are nice and durable. At least one has been stepped on with no noticeable damage caused. I had to replace a few of the mini-bags they come in though. Even with light handling they can tear at the seams.

Theme: (3)
I didn't really expect a theme. I think there is some story along the lines of: some rich people are racing to build a rail network. If that's true then there's a problem. What are they buying it with colored train cards? I think this is one of the few games that is more enjoyable if you ignore the theme and just have fun with screwing people over.

Learning: (4)
The rules are really easy. I've taught this game to first timers more than any other game except maybe Pandemic. The most common issues that arise are wanting to do two different things on the same turn, and wanting to play a partial route between two cities. So, now I make it a point to repeat those points a few times before we start. The rulebook is perfectly succinct and problem free.

Gameplay: (5)
This game can get really heated. My favorites are 3 and 5 players. With 3, the double routes are still locked, so certain areas like around the Mississippi River corridor get really competitive. With 5, you have the max number of players allowed and everyone is just getting up in other peoples' business. There's no limitation to where you are allowed to put trains so if someone blocks you, the great thing is you can block them right back. Just make sure that you are still able to complete some tickets. I tried playing a game once where I didn't focus on tickets, but instead on blocking everyone I could. It didn't go well, so you need those tickets!

Overall Fun: (4)
This is always a reliable game that I can bring out at any time and have a good time. There are some games where I have great feelings and not so great feelings coming out of a play. With this game, I always feel good about it. It doesn't do anything special or complicated. It's just a box o' fun.

Dan's copy.

I made all my friends refer to this as, "The Train Game." I like it well enough, I guess. But I'd rather play other things.

UPDATE AFTER A FEW MORE PLAYS (months after first impressions): I have to admit, this game did not strike me and was rated not very highly for the longest time. But Dan and I have been playing the Mega Game with the 1910 expansion and now I can't get enough Ticket (in typical girlfriend manner, to my own shame). TICKET IS FUN!

RATING: 7
This is a train game wherein players must claim train routes between cities.  Each player has a number of secret "tickets" which dictate which cities the player is trying to establish a route for.  Any incomplete tickets count against you.  On your turn you have only 3 options: draw a train card, claim a route, or draw more tickets.  Given the limited options and that most routes between to adjoining cities may only be claimed once, there is great tension in each turn.  Delay too long and you'll lose opportunity, act too fast and you'll never complete the longer routes.

Really good introductory game -- I love pulling this out when new people show up for my game nights.  I don't often suggest this with people who show a strategic lilt.  It's a good game to gauge interest in learning new games.

The new people all love it (usually ... those with more strategic minds tend to find it a bit boring).

I really do LOVE the entire TTR franchise.  At first I rated this game a bit lower, but over time (and with the addition of the 1910 expansion) I have come to really love the simplicity of this version.  It is easy to play a full game (set up, play, tear down) in about 30 minutes when playing with 2 players.  My wife and I play several times a week after the kids go to bed.

8 without the 1910 expansion.  Another star with it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Tense is the one word i would use to describe Ticket to ride. The second, simple. The ruleset is elegant enough that anyone can play but it has enough meat to really get into it. It can get really intense when you're waiting on just that one last card you need and you hope your opponent doesn't realize where you're going and blocks you completely.

Good game. The only thing that bothers me, is that unexperienced players just have a slim chance of winning against experienced players. Apart from that it is great.

Next time in Norway we'll try to get the Scandinavian version.

Should appeal to a wide range of gamers. There's enough and little enough in there for most. There's nothing particularly exciting, interesting or clever about it. Seems to just roll along in its own simple way until it comes to a conclusion. I'm liking it more after getting a few more plays under the belt. I now see the different strategies possible. Nice and quick paced. Works well with young kids (from 6-7yo), and teaches them some basic geography too.

Really like this game. But after having played a number of games, husband and I know what most of the destination tickets are.

My second game after Settlers.  This one actually led to my new passion for the board gaming hobby after being stagnant with Settlers for a couple years.

Great all around gateway/family game.  Very solid and I'd never turn down a game.  I ALWAYS play with the 1910 expansion w/ all tickets.  I prefer to play with Alvin and Dexter whenever possible as well.

8/14 - I still like this game, but it has really lost it's lustre and is nowhere near the first game I'd introduce non-gamers to.  Still solid, but I'd probably suggest something else.

I really like how the ticket to ride series incorporates long term planning into the short term tactical decisions you have to make about what cards and routes to go for quickly. Overall, I like how the original map has more 6's spread out than Europe. However, while I have not noticed it myself, I can see how east-west versus north-south tickets are unbalanced.

This probably has the crown for best gateway game to get people into modern board gaming.  Simple rules, simple gameplay, and has little trains you can put on to the board.  Take a card or two, play those cards to complete route tickets from point A to B, or draw new tickets.  That's it!  It always was a little too light weight for me, but I won't deny it is well made and enjoyable.

But still, I definitely love this game and so does everyone that I have played it with!

This is a fantastic game.  Quick and easy with no dice.  THE gateway game, you never have to go back to 4 hours of Monopoly again.  My wife loves it.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I like a game that has very simple rules but a lot of depth, and Ticket to Ride fits that bill. The goal is to get the most points, and these are obtained by completing short routes, completing service between two assigned cities, and by having the most longest line of continuous routes. On any given turn you're drawing train cards, playing train cards to complete a route, or drawing new assignments for service between two cities. There are a few exceptions to these rules, but overall it's a very easy game to learn. 

UPDATE: Dropping from 9 to an 8. Still very good, but after repeated playings I feel like I want "more to do" in the game. I've begun to see the same strategies repeated, so it's taken a hit on replay value. But still a great game, and really one of the best "full-strength" gateway games to recruit new gamers. I'm very much enjoying the Swiss map variant as included in the PC computer game version of the board game.

UPDATE: Dropping from an 8 to a 7. After numerous plays, the game wears on me. It's still good as a gateway game, though, and I am willing to play. I would prefer to play a TTR variant, and I'm quite likely to bring up a counter-suggestion rather than go ahead with another TTR. Because of this, my rating could drop to a 6.5. I hate to do it though, because it's a great game, I've just played it to death.

I have continously gone back to Ticket to Ride with newer gamers.  The theme and simplicity of the rules are a huge plus for introducing people to board games (other than monopoly/risk/sorry....etc).

Plays usally in 90 minutes or so, and is easy to converse at the same time as playing.  A great mix of luck and strategy and rarely do anyone feelings gets hurt.

This will continously be played in my household because, as of right now, nothing has come close to taking its place for relaxed night with new gamers.

This now joins Settlers and Carcassonne in the patheon of greats - and I suspect it may have a longer life-span than either of the other two.

Great gateway game. On one hand, a very fun and simple family game but on the other, can easily escalate to vicious route stealing with the right gamers--which is great fun too. I would suggest this be your first game purchase if you want to get into board gaming. If you aren't new to board gaming I suggest Ticket to Ride:Europe over the US game. It adds a little more depth to the game by adding ferries, tunnels, and train stations.

This one is simpler to teach than TtR:E and the geography is more familiar to North Americans - which makes finding ticket destinations easier for the people to whom this will be introduced. Since it lacks stations, it's less forgiving and, thus, more tension filled - which may be off-putting to new players - but I prefer it this way. The larger replacement cards in the 1910 expansion are more than welcome.

This is my top rated game as of 2016. I don't think it's necessarily the "best" game and not the one I'm currently most excited to play, but it really is a great go-to for getting new people into board games. It's so easy to teach, and the tension of deciding whether to take a card or lay down your tracks really makes this game shine. Specifically I love the flexibility the expansions we have add (especially the Asia one!)

This has been the favorite of all my games so far.  It has the right amount of strategy vs luck, the rules can be explained in about five minutes, and non-gamers understand the strategies and have a blast playing it.  Referred to as "the train game" by my non-gamers, this is a game you won't hate to play with friends - gamers and non-gamers alike.  Starts slow enough that you can explain rules again a time or two before it hurts much not to know them, and the tension and excitement rises until the frantic ending play.

This game holds a special place in my collection. It was my introduction to board  gaming. That was 5 years ago and my collection has grown quite a bit since then and it is all thanks to this game. I think that says a lot for the game. It is one I always suggest for new gamers and pull out for my non-gaming family. My copy had the smaller cards, but the 1910 expansion was an easy enough fix, but I believe the new prints have the standard size cards. Love the game. It is fun and easy to learn, with plenty of competition.

2012 tax return splurge for Zack and Julia

This is THE gateway game that I can recommend to anyone curious about 21st century tabletop games.  It is a milestone in modern gaming history and is proof that good introductory strategy games can be both educational, well-designed, simple to teach, and still appeal to both Euro gamers as well as thematic gamers. It never feels like a dumbed down game, rather its simplicity in set-collecting and route-building is what makes the game quite tactical and replayable especially with so many available expansion maps.  The only reason we don't play this board game more often is because it has become available to us to play online locally via our iOS devices. This is a great gift for non-gamer friends and family too!

I like the way this game feels like playing around with graph theory, it's like I'm building a minimum spanning tree or something :)

Although some people here on BGG hate this, I really enjoy it.  Mostly we play friendly (no purposeful route blocking), which makes building mechanic much different (gradual rather than burst).  There is still blocking, but not on purpose (well, I need nashville to atlanta too).  If you havent ever tried game like this, its a nice change.  Great game to have conversation during, although turns keep coming.

I love train games, so this purchase was a given as soon as I heard a description.  Fortunately, it has turned out to be quite a pleasant game.  I like the fact that it is quick (compared to my fave--Empire Builder) and that there is more to it than TransAmerica.  So I now have a continuum of train games (that my wife will request) depending on the amount of time I wish to invest.  At any rate, I like the challenge of trying to put together the routes you are dealt at the beginning of the game and catching hold of necessary routes before they disappear, as well as the possibility of pre-emptively blocking routes you think your opponents might need.

-------------------------------
As much as I hate to do it, I have had to knock the rating on this down a level.  TTR Nordic has come along and replaced as my favorite in the series.  And since most of my games are 2-3 players, it managed to pick up most of the plays as well.  This is still an excellent game, and my second favorite overall--the one I would go to first if I had 4-5 players. [05/07/2009]

RATING: 7
A great "gateway" game, because the mechanics are quite simple. This game maintains a tense environment where everyone has goals and no one knows if someone will thwart them before their next turn.

Minor complaint - Some routes award BOOKOO points. If you play with a group that doesn't believe in blocking other players, I believe those players with said routes have a big advantage.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
This year I've played some vanilla Ticket to Ride after being accustomed to TTR:E version. And the more I played this version the more I hated it. 

First reason - distribution of tickets. TTR:E and following editions have long tickets separated. 
Second reason and the main reason: this version does not promote drawing more tickets. Instead it awards card counting and doing long relations even if not a part of one's tickets. This turns a game which was for me more of a laid back fun with some risk taking into a calculating game of optimisation. :yuk:
In short: what takes one to be good at this game is what I like the least in TTR:E
Third reason: you call this geography... Heh. Well I live in Europe so I'm kinda more connected to European map. 

Currently I rate TTR:E a 7.0

[66 plays] This is well done at every level. Beautiful components, tight and easy rules, scales well from 2 players on up to 5, fast play, and a healthy mix of fun and light tension.

I have yet to introduce this game to anyone that hasn't immediately enjoyed it.

This is one of those games--like monopoly--that I played before I got into boardgames and made me think that I hated boardgames. Nonetheless, it's possible that I just got a crappy introduction to it. 

Update: Got this in a humble bundle some time ago. Finally got around to trying it 2-player with my wife. It is ok, I guess. Base game map seems too roomy for two. After more careful reflection, I think I don't like this game because of the mean-hearted nature of the interaction. Of course, you don't have to play mean, but in that case it's just boring all around.

Update 2: Played a 3-player game with wife and sister. The app is really irritating when used for pass-and-play, since there is hidden information. I think it works a lot better with 3 than with 2, but it's still either nasty or boring. I did have more fun, though, being on the other end of nasty this time.

Ticket to Ride is a simpler game than Airlines Europe and a very light version of Empire Builder. I'd place TTR more along the lines of Around the World in 80 Days.  Having played all four, I rank this below the rest and would only pull it out as a gateway game. The other games mentioned offer various degrees of depth and strategy whereas TTR is mainly a set collection card game...a little overly simplistic for my tastes. I'm sure millions of other gamers would disagree with me on this one, and that's okay. Maybe the other expansions would offer a better experience?

RATING: 5
Great game for the less-motivated gamers.  It does not have the depth of the type of games I particularly enjoy though.  It has since dropped in my personal ratings due to the simplicity of remembering the ticket routes.  Not a bad game by any means, just not my preference.

Perfect game.  When I first started researching games on BGG I saw the many recommendations of this as a good gateway game... but even so, I initially fought them due to concern over the theme.  Luckily I gave in and this is a big hit with our family and great for introducing to new gamers.  Cards could be bigger but other than that a very very good and universally appealing game.

I credit Ticket to Ride with getting me away from worrying so much about 'liking' the theme before I buy.

RATING: 7
Ticket to Ride has a surprising amount of depth and strategy for a game with only four pages of rules. It's also a nice game to have around for kids, or people who aren't "gamers." The main problem with the original version of the game is that the long-route cards are overvalued, so it's hard to win if you're not lucky on the draw. The game requires a bit of multi-tasking to play well and keep track of several tickets at once.

Nice and easy to learn, quite competitive and doesn't extend the brain too much... which is ALWAYS a plus (I play games for enjoyment and fun... NOT to end up with a thumping headache trying to work out where to place my cubes and why!! etc... rant over...).

Plays better with 4-5 players. But ok with 2-3

Mr. Moon has hit upon something here.  First couple of games were nothing special but there is a rush to playing it, a desperation that you feel as you try and get your routes finished and (even more delicious) scramble to find the alternate route when the original is blocked.  I have won and lost spectacularly and enjoyed both.

Overrated due to early initial favourable reviews. Received undue attention. The game has some depth but lacks the tension of play found in Moon's earlier masterpieces like 'Union Pacific' and 'Mammoth Hunters'. A good Moon game but not a classic in any sense of the word. Overhyped and overrated. People are dazzled by the so-called quality of the components. Definitely inferior to Transamerica.

Based on my limited experience, TtR is a solid, fun game. I think it is likely the best gateway game I have ever played. If I needed a game for a group of gamers and non-gamers, or ALL non-gamers, TtR would be at the top of my list. The set-collecting mechanic works well as a means of developing your routes, and the route cards add a timing element to the strategy of that enriches what would otherwise be a more tedious affair. Best of all, my 5 year old can play it and has fun, even if she doesn't always make the best decisions. Unfortunately, Ticket to Ride takes just a *little* it too long for what it offers: which is a light, social gaming experience. I wouldn't want to play it with more than four players again, and I don't think I would ever request it, but I wouldn't mind playing it as light entertainment while having a discussion about something else.

Quite possibly the perfect game for our group.  Very simple, elegant rules means non-gamers can learn it very quickly and you don't have to spend a lot of time explaining special cases.  Strategically, you have to balance getting your own work done vs sacrificing yourself to hinder the leader.  In building your lines, you must combine deception with backup plans to prevent getting blocked, but on the other hand must construct efficiently.  Risk taking plays a role as well, as you can grab for points which are essential to victory but costs time and is catastrophic if you miss.  The board scales elegantly to fewer or more players with the double line option, and I noticed this game is gender neutral, as women seem just as interested as men and have little trouble winning.

The PC/app version will do in a pinch, but this is one of those games that is a hundred times better with other people face to face, listening to the sound of the little plastic trains as everyone constantly makes tiny adjustments to them when they shift around on the board.

I don't play much, but I enjoy it when I do. I lose a lot because I'm trying desperately to get the mad achievements like scoring a million points (whatever it is) or completing a thousand tickets (probably not that many, lol) so I have to gamble and pull loads of tickets in the hope that I've already completed them or can complete them relatively easily.

Like many others have said, this is a great gateway game for non-gamers. Gameplay is straightforward and quick. There are plenty of different strategies available, though some of these feel antithesis to the idea of the game (blocking routes, going only for longer segments, etc.). This game, or perhaps one of its many variants, is a staple for collections often played by non-gamers.

This is a good albeit simple game. It's not one I'd be pulling out and suggesting to play but not one I'd turn down either.
It's deficiencies would be that it lacks scope, and long term complexity or many opportunities to tactically maneuver against others.
A good gateway game, good for kids and good for people who don't play many games.

The route cards you get can really make a big difference. Its well worth spending a round or 2 near the start of the game getting some additional route careds, if you manage to get a couple of the larger routes and tie in a few shorter ones as well you will be in an unstoppable position.

Nice gateway for non-gamers. Doesn't do much for me: if this is about travellers engaged in a nonsensical race of out-travelling each other, what is the exclusivity of the routes supposed to represent? The answer is simple: nothing at all. Probably Anna's favourite.

I only have the base game. I think it would be nice to increase the card size for the base game. All in all, a very solid game. However, I just dont feel the stress as I do in other games. I like stressful game. This is because of "unskilled" players in the games I play. I may revisit this comment later and change my rating if I play with people that have played multiple times before

This is a great game. I always add in 1910. I hope we get more map packs.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Cutthroat and quick... I like it! With higher player counts it can feel sort of repetitive though. NEEDS fast players, or else it feels like you're constantly just waiting to draw cards... again. Also 1910 expansion is pretty much a must because screw small cards. Globetrotter bonus makes things more fun too.

This is a great map because it handles all player counts 2-5 well. At any given player count there's probably a map that does it marginally better, but here is your versatile map that can handle cutthroat 2 player games just as well as it can handle looser 4 player games or crowded 5 player games

[b]Criticisms:[/b] 

*The 1910 expansion really should have been rolled into the base game by now in a second edition, since it's essentially a minor "fix" or update for the base game, balancing short routes vs long ones and adding the Globetrotter bonus

* This game is often hailed as a great gateway game, and I can see it working for some (and it must have worked for many people to get that reputation in the first place) but honestly the player interaction is subtle and sophisticated, and so it can feel a bit cold and non-inclusive for many people I think. The quiet and tense interaction is very real when everyone already "gets" the game, but as a gateway option that's more interesting to social-types, I'd rather do something with more table talk and inter-person interaction.

(5 Design + 3 Enjoyment)

Ticket to Ride is a modern classic. It's rare to find something that isn't a party or kids game that I can pull out with the family and have no problems with explaining it. The play is very simple to grasp and the production really helps get people into the game. It also has just the right amount of competitiveness. Taking cards and routes that the other players want can make for some great fun that never gets too serious because the game offers so many alternatives and opportunities. And that is definitely part of the fun. One of my favorite family games and one that will always have a place in my collection.

RATING: 4
Well, it's ok.  The theme works, the art is appealing, and the gameplay is engaging enough to get you about 2/3rds of the way through the game (if you can get past the lack of interaction).  The problem is that it really comes down to a luck of the draw endgame.  

There are really two ways to win in the game, going for connecting cities, and drafting cards to make long connections. Either way works well and is nicely balanced, but my issue is that the endgame devolves around waiting for the right cards to come up.  After you have connected routes, there is a desire to get more routes as there is nothing left for you to do in the game--no objective.  Well, near the end game, in a desire to continue to get points you are given the decision to draw new routes again and hope that the cards come up that will allow you to connect.  If you can get them you will probably win, if you don't you will probably lose.  

Ultimately, I just can't love a game that relies that heavily on the luck of the draw.  Clippers is more my speed. 

I was coerced into playing Phase 10 at a party and realised that this is really just a variant on that with a board and more to choose from.  Can't see myself ever playing this again. 

Draw, Draw, Draw, Draw, Draw, Draw, Draw, Draw, Draw, Play, Draw, Draw, Draw, Play, Draw, Draw, Draw, Play, Zzzz, Draw, Draw, Draw, Play.

Update: I played it again, thought I should downgrade my rating to a 4, then saw that it was already a 4.  I was right the first time.

Inoffensive, but my least favorite of the "Big 3" gateway games (with Carcassone and Settlers). The pacing of play feels unnatural--like there's supposed to be a hand limit, but the only thing that keeps you playing is the need to beat other players to the routes you need.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Simple, fast, easy to teach.  Personal rating systems have a tendency to become snobbish with the quick and easy, but in this case I rate it poorly because it never feels like you outthought your opponents.  I happened to get there first with the cards I drew and got the connections that most often linked up with each other.  So I won.

I have played this a couple of times and have found it to be a light but very fun game.  Players are faced with taking one of three actions on every turn, and must weigh decisions of claiming new routes with gambling to take more destination tickets while playing a little defense to recognize opponents' routes and blocking if appropriate.

This is still a stalwart game in my collection to play with new players and those of intermediate experience.  Fast and simple enough to play in under an hour, but with enough tension and content to feel like you are really into the game.

TTR is a great game. There is tension throughout as you try to prevent the other players from stealing your routes. Do you pick up that card you need or lay a short route to prevent someone else from taking it? The game can move a little slow for a gateway game. 

I will rarely suggest that we play TTR but my wife loves it.

There is a fiercely competitive game buried under that family game exterior. A lot of opportunities to screw up your opponent's plans. After a score of playings, I've put this one down a notch, since the luck factor plays such a huge part in this version.

A nice "middle ground" twixt games like Empire Builder and Rail Baron and the "too light" fare of Transamerica. Lots of immediate and consequential decision-making right from the get-go. Seemed to accomodate my "newbie" decisions well, allowing me to feel in contention until game's end. . ."Minus" points for route cards at the end is a little harsh, but it increases the intensity of what might otherwise be a casual decision to expand your network. I liked it. A lot. . .would most definitely play it again and seek it out at my nearby game store.

RATING: 5
The best all-around "gateway game" I know of, Ticket to Ride is quick and exciting, though rather luck-driven. Give me the right tickets at the beginning, and I'll win every time. But still a good time for players of all ages. Definitely much better with the larger cards from the 1910 expansion, or one of the other big boxes--those little train cards suck to shuffle.

Certainly the most popular of our family games, to the extent we don't play it nearly as often as we used to because of the fights we have over it. My wife, a professor in game theory, have figured out the right way to play it, and wins at least half of the time, which also lessens the interest in it (I won't tell you what she does!) As a matter of give-away for our kid, we allow him to pick both the engine and a colored car on his turn, and that almost makes it enough to par our chances... for the second place.

So much like Union Pacific, yet so different, and perhaps better if only because of its cleaner design. As with U.P., downtime is minimal, so it works fine with 5 players; a bit less intense with 4, because there is not as much direct competition. It may not be the most profound game in the world, but our group is always ready to play it, and we never fail to have fun.

Fairly simple set collection train game.  Players compete to build train routes between different cities by collecting groups of like-colored cards.

Overall a solid game - it's not by chance that Ticket to Ride is so highly regarded as a gateway game to the hobby.

One of THE go to game when you are introducing people to tabletop board gaming. It is easy to learn, hard to master. It has a decent amount of luck involved, while not seeming unfair. If you failed a ticket, it's most often because you were off with your timing. You feel responsible.

+ Setup is easy. Grab your bag of trains, set out the board, shuffle the two decks and go.
+ Easy to learn, just 3 options. Everyone can count to six and recognize colors (or you are probably too young for games anyway)
+ The plastic trains are great game pieces and well made

- The tiny cards are just stupid. Days of Wonder, just put the big cards in the big box instead of shoving them into an expansion. It is really annoying and it makes me not want to buy that expansion.   

One third of my 'Introduction Trinity', games I'd play to introduce players to tabletop gaming, with Pandemic and Settlers of Catan

A game where you try to build the best railroad by completing routes. Each player has their own routes they're trying to complete, while trying to stop their opponents from completing theirs.  It's very simple to learn, but with a lot of room for strategy.

Honestly, this doesn't do all that much for me.  I'm not that much of a set collection gamer, and that's really what this is.  On the Underground is a route-building game, and I really like it.  I think that Europe is my favorite of all the TtR editions, because I like the uncertainty of the tunnels without the complexity of Marklin.

(Ticket to Ride) Tends to be a bit too simple. Thurn und Taxis is the better light route building game in every aspect. TTR is a nice gateway game, in this regard it was also a good SdJ decision, it's just that T&T is the better game so no real need to come back to TTR. (except maybe for some variety from time to time...)

A great gateway game to bring non-gamers into the fold. Luck can play a little too strong a role for my tastes at times, but gameplay is quick, solid, and entertaining.

I'm a sucker for trains. Plus, it's Ticket to Ride. Who doesn't enjoy this at least a bit? I won't claim that it's a deep or brilliant design, but it's a pleasant way to spend an hour. That said, the 1910 expansion really should be included with new copies of the game.

RATING: 3
I know I'm weird on this one... but I realized soon after buying Ticket to Ride that it wasn't a game for me. The three-star rating isn't really my opinion of the game's design—of course it's a classic!—but a personal reflection of the fact that I'm not into it. I find it really dry and unexciting.

Although I have only played the android version, I think it gives a good indication of the strengths and weaknesses of the board game. A decent introduction to gaming, it may not satisfy heavy-duty strategists but this is fun for the family and lighter gamers.

I much prefer this to Settlers of Catan which after a while lost its appeal. I traded it away as I couldn't bear sitting through another 2 hours of frustration as no-one ever rolls a 6, 7 or 8.

Ticket to Ride is much more involving in this respect.

Although it's a fun game, it just doesn't seem all that exciting. You spend a long time drawing cards, then play a bunch of stuff. BUT, it's better with more players, and I can see I have a lot to learn about how/when to draw destination tickets, lay out tracks etc. Also, it has been _great_ for introducing games to nongamers.

I like the Mystery Train expansion, which adds a little bit to the game.

This game is near perfect for me. The game plays quickly and I really enjoy it at all numbers. The only complaint I had was the card size was too small, but that was fixed with the 1910 expansion, and now the game is a complete pleasure to play.

I prefer playing this game online against bots as a simple diversion -- with other people, I find there's too much analysis paralysis for such a straightforward game.  A little too much solitaire masquerading as a group boardgame, though there is some interaction and screw-your-buddy involved.  Fantastic game for getting newbies into boardgaming, however, and it'll always be one of my first recommendations for new gamers to get into the hobby.  There's just something about trains!

Edit 08/08/09:  Revised down to a 6 from 6.5 after playing TTR:E for the first time (which I gave a 7).  I guess I'd play regular TTR if someone asked, but TTR:E really is the better game and there's no reason not to play it instead (other than not having it on hand).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
One of the only games I knew I would like just after opening the box and reading the rules.  Simple to learn, fun to play for gamers and newcomers, and many strategic options.  Not a "ten" only because the initial card draw can play too large a role, especially if someone has two or three tickets with cities that interrelate, i.e. you complete Seattle to New York and you also have a second card with Seattle that is completed along the way. Update: you can overcome poor draws, so bump it to ten!

This was one of the first designer board games I purchased because I loved it so much.  It's simple and easy to teach but hard to master and has a lot of strategy and replay value.  When explaining it to people it's hard to get them interested in a game where you lay trains and build tracks across the country but everyone I've taught has really taken to it.

This is a solid game for the holidays, when you find yourself with non-gamer relatives - when you want something accessibly fun but with enough competition to keep it interesting.  It's easy to teach, and the young 'uns can compete and still do relatively well.  I think I'll try the Nordic countries edition, as I hear it's more tight and competitive throughout.  The endgame to the vanilla version can get tight as the options for tracks decrease, as the first 2/3 of the game consist with alot of card picking and players vying for the plentiful tracks on the board.  Still, a classic.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Swiss map & 1910 expansion add a fair amount to the base game. Good, clean, simple all-American* fun for everyone I've played with, too - a hit with all that touch it. - seriously, even people who aren't really into games - and a lot of my enjoyment comes from introducing it to others.

Bumping the score up another 0.5 for that (already bumped from 8 to 9) - it's the only game on this list that friends and family are clamouring to play again and again.
EDIT: Apart from Pandemic, but even so, TTR is the one which family and friends are picking up - to date, Dad, sister, school mate, wife's friends have all picked it up.

"Whoooo - whoooo! I'm laying track baby"

EDIT - score was 9.5 in Jun 2012. Taking it down a bit to 8.5 as it's not really hitting the table in the last 3 years or so...

This is the game every family needs. I can play it with my folks and enjoy it, as it is simple enough to explain the rules in less than 10 minutes, but I can play it with younger relatives as well. Has a nice balance between luck/strategy/complexity/easiness/fun.

It may come off as somewhat of a surprise, but I am really finding Ticket to Ride still enjoyable all these years later. When I was first getting into gaming, I didn't like it very much because I considered it to be too simple, but after refining my tastes I actually like this little set-collecting game quite a bit. I rarely play the US map as I almost always break this out with 3 players (which necessitates using Switzerland), but when I do, I find I enjoy it quite a bit.

This might be the perfect 'gateway game', if such a thing exists. I can play this with anyone, and they'll almost always have fun. It's a bit too unbalanced to satisfy gamers in the long run; the tickets should be awarded more generously and I dislike the longest route bonus: it only stimulates players even more to invest in long connections.
This is mostly fixed with either USA 1910 or Switzerland, and I hardly play without them anymore.
But setting that aside, it's a very enjoyable game that I can suggest anyone, with the possible exception of hard core gamers.

Ticket to Ride is a family style game that scales well, and is easy enough that non-gamers can do fine in their first attempt. Personally, I'd rather play TransAmerica (which is faster) or Rail Baron (which is meatier), but TTR suits my wife so it hits the table occasionally.

I see why this game is a classic, but hasn't hit the table much for my group. Dry theme and didn't like USA map at 2pl count. Prefer co-op games with my partner.  2-5pl games don't seem to get much play with my current game group (6-8 pl is about the norm).  

Update: Finally played w/ 4pl - Upgraded rating.  Will probably only play at higher player count and never with 2pl; partner isn't a huge fan of train set collecting and this runs a bit long in general for complexity. 

+ USA 1910 expansion! Hope to address some issues with more ticket cards.

Ultimate gateway game.  One of the best games to show friends or family who have never played a eurogame.  Fairly simple, though.  If you start with a few cross country routes you win, though.  1910 fixes that a bit.

Very light.  Good intro to gaming, but the USA board is way too big for two players.  Have played with 4 and the group had fun, which is a big part of gaming, but I'm always left with a slightly underwhelmed feeling at the end.  My boyfriend enjoys this more than me because he sometimes likes the light games that require a little strategy/thinking but not too much, but I really feel (even as a relatively new gamer) that there aren't enough decisions to make here.  And as with many Euros, there's not enough interaction.  Yes, there's blocking, but sometimes you're guessing as to whether you're even accomplishing a successful "block" and that's still a pretty limited form of interaction.  I think this would be a good game for families with kids.  I've also played the Swiss map with 2 players -- definitely an improvement for 2, but most of my complaints still remain.

RATING: 4.5
Draw a card or two... draw a card or two... draw a card or two... draw a card or two... play cards to lay a train... and repeat.  This pretty much describes both the advantages and the disadvantages of this game.  On the positive side, it is very simple to learn and fun enough that it makes an ideal game to teach to non-gamers.  On the negative side, there is just not enough going on here to keep me interested in repeat plays.  Of the three editions, I thought that "TTR: Europe" was a slight improvement over the original, but I found "TTR: Marklin" to be the most fun.  Game design: 3/5  Personal enjoyment: 1.5/5  Total: 4.5/10

Ticket to Ride is another game I like to play with new gamers. I did have one bad experience where I set up the game with one player who played it once with me and several novices. I came back to the table two hours later, and they were still playing! "This game is not as fun as I remember." Don't leave inexperienced players to themselves.

Update: After several years, I see this more as a lowest common denominator kind of game. I don't get too excited about playing it anymore.

The original, Spiele des Jahres prizewinning Ticket to Ride, exactly as the rules came out of the box, is still in my opinion the best in the series by a country mile.  While many players like their chances mitigated by the extra cards or the other bells and whistles in the later versions, I like the cold equations, the do-or-die dash of this game.  PS:  I'm not pleased about this, but I'm reducing my rating from a 9 to a 7 because it's impossible to get it played with my regular group.  They are too deeply invested in the variations.

I think all the kudos this game gets are deserved.  It simply is a lot of fun.  It seems to have the perfect combination of easy rules, decent playing time, and a bit of strategy.

Light and fluffy, Ticket to Ride still hasn't really caught my interest after several playthroughs.  Each game has felt like solitare except a couple of key moments that were hard to see coming.  Also, one probably needs a long mission card (or 2) for the win, and the luck of the draw is massive.  Fun for the whole family, I suppose, but I either need more fun-factor or more weight from a game.  Still worth playing every once in a while, but too long for what it is.

BGG User Bagherra said 
" No gateway game list can be written without a mention of Ticket to Ride. The game pretty much speaks for itself, but just a few words on why I think it is the gateway of gateway games. There are only three things you can do on a turn. There is one printed page of rules (4 with pictures). A three year old can be taught how to play. It readily supports a full family of players. This is the ultimate family game. If you have a family and you want to play a game with them, this is the game I would get. Period. End of story. I cannot think of any other game which is truly a "family game" the way Ticket to Ride is."

What can I say? Though millions of fans can, indeed, be wrong despite popular notions to the contrary, they are certainly not wrong here. I don't like the small cards and it could stand to be tweaked out as far as rout distributions (Like the Europe edition), but it's a whole lot of fun.

[5 plays]  I had been looking forward to trying this game after hearing about it.  I think it is definately easier to learn and plays at a faster pace than another favorite of mine Sante Fe Rails.  After the first game though, I didn't really know what to think, I really got whooped.  So I thought I didn't get something with it.  The second game I was a close second place though.  I don't think I really played better or worse, but just got better ticket cards and the right colors when I need them more in the second game.  It was decent game and I can understand why it is popular gateway game.  It seemed like it does have a fair amount of luck to me, and I think I prefter games to be a little more calculating and heavy, it felt just a touch lighter than I prefer.  But still an overall fun time and solid game.

One of the most addictive games that I have played yet!  I have never really been into trains but this game is a real race that gets more and more intense as the game winds down.  It also offers a good range of strategies and plenty of tactical maneuvering.  Awesome!

Un biglietto per l’avventura!
2 Ottobre 1900 – Sono passati 28 anni dal giorno in cui l’eccentrico viaggiatore londinese Phileas Fogg accettò e vinse una scommessa del valore di 20000 sterline, in cui dichiarò di poter fare “il giro del mondo in 80 giorni”. Oggi agli albori del XX secolo è tempo per una nuova impossibile sfida. Un gruppo di vecchi amici si sono riuniti per celebrare le mirabolante impresa di Fogg e soprattutto per proporne e compierne una nuova. Il premio: 1 milione di dollari ad un solo vincitore. L’obiettivo: 7 giorni per vedere chi riuscirà a visitare e viaggiare in più città del Nord America.
Il viaggio incomincia ora…
Ticket to ride è un’avvincente sfida ferroviaria attraverso l’America del Nord. I giocatori usano vari tipi di carte Treno con l’obiettivo di connettere diverse città. Più lungo è il percorso, più punti vittoria si accumulano.
Inoltre, addizionali punti vittoria si ottengono costruendo in assoluto il tratto ferroviario più lungo o soddisfando i requisiti delle carte Biglietto.
Che cosa aspetti? Salta in carrozza ed incomincia la tua fantastica avventura ferroviaria! 

Elenco elementi di gioco:
1 Mappa del Nord America
240 Vagoni colorati
110 Carte Treno
30 Carte Biglietto
1 Carta Bonus Percorso più lungo
5 Segnapunti in legno
1 Manuale delle regole
1 Codice di accesso online

My brother in law (who works for the national railways...) brought along a new game a couple of years ago. This was the Original version of Ticket 2 Ride.
Needless to say that we were very fond of the game straight away and bought a copy ourselves shortly after.
And now we have the entire collection...
Due to the additional rules, I think T2R Europe is the best out the whole series, scoring even higher than this initial game.
Is there some kind of T2R Anonymous group? ;)

Very nice.  Simple to learn.  Frustrating decisions to make.  "Wooden scoring markers" as a feature?  There's one scoring marker per player so that makes five bits of wood ... probably used more wood to make the box.  Silly.  It's like those DVDs that tout "Interactive menus" as a feature ...  Best played with four or more.  Playing with three players can be quite frustrating as the double routes are reduced to singles and routing becomes a lot more difficult.

I really like this game, it is a good beer and pretzels game, or a good family game. 

It does not take too long, is pure euro so no guns, bombs, knives, but that does not mean you can't be as mean as hell to each other while playing.  

Only complaint, this has the small cards, I like the larger ones that come in the Europe edition better.

Card set game with good analogous theme
But it is mainly about making train routes with the card but experienced palyers can make points by just building lots of medium lenght tracks which spoils it for me.

RATING: 6
Light set collection game with a railway theme. Players are attempting to collect sets of different coloured cards, which in turn allow them to place their carriages onto the tracks linking different American cities. The longer the track, the more points are awarded (one point for a one length track, 15 for a six length). Players can also earn point by having the longest continual track at the end of the game and from completing tickets, whereby two cities on the map have to be linked together and the further they are apart, the more points are available. This can have a downside as incomplete tickets lead to a deduction of points. The game flows well, it is a simple concept and players new to board gaming seem to grasp it. There is a bit of luck involved when acquiring the tickets as some of them are very similar to one another thereby making them a lot easier to complete, but overall this is a tried and tested gateway game, useful for introducing people to the hobby.

So this isn't my favorite game... but I rated it a 9... and WHY did I rate it a 9?  Because I can pull it out anytime, and KNOW that people will love it.  Sure, I might get some raised eyebrows, but once they start into it, they love it.  And when you have friends who aren't "gamers" that's a VERY important thing

Great Euro-game.  The train theme is cool but really doesn't affect gameplay (it could be called ticket to fly with little or no change to the rules).  The rules are quick to learn, easy to teach and very intuitive.  It is a great gateway game to get your non-gamer friends into playing these.

Great gateway game, I played it a lot. Components are nice and there is a feeling of tension while playing it. There is very little strategy involved and most of the time what you choose to do won't make any difference.

Has this ever happend to you? you're with your favorite gaming group and you dont now what to play. "That one's too complex, the newbie doesnt know that one, that one doesn't play good with four..." Then someone brings up TTR. "It's for beginners and a good introduction to german wargames."

It's like a Budweiser it meets all the general requirements of a generic game without offending anyone and has no character, no edge, to speak of. 

It’s not really a bad game at all it’s biggest fault is probably that it takes too long for what it is. It’s not very deep and there’s not a whole of excitement to it either. This might be fine for ½ hour but 2 hours is way too long. We can get it down to just under 2 hrs but not by much. If it was shorter I would up the mark.

RATING: 8
Simple yet brilliant railway game.  For me, it evokes a lot of the fun that is inherent in travel; being able to tick places to visit off your list.  The gamble you take when you choose which cities to try to connect is the key to the greatness of the game.  The feeling of desperation when you think you are not going to make it and then the feeling of relief when you pull it off is classic.  Player interaction isn't a large part of the game, but that is compensated for by the fact that you are always working towards a target.

RATING: 4
It is ticket to ride, a game which for some reason is one of the "mainstream" games in Norway. 
It is easy to play, some player interaction, and a little boring. Missions is so hit or miss that it is silly, the biggest missions is about 20 points, and if you do not make it you get minus that amount of points. This means that it is over 40 points difference if you make the biggest missions or if you does not make it. And everything comes down to luck because people can sabotage you. I say luck because people often have to sabotage themselves in order to sabotage you.
I usually end up hoarding cards half of the game, and buying the largest railways the second half of the game. This means that the game ends extremely fast, people have no way of stopping it, people struggle with reaching their missions, and I usually end up winning. It is a strategy that requires no thinking at all, and seems like the best strategy to use because it does not requires any luck at all.

There are much better games out there one can play with friends like power grid, prosperity, small world and suburbia to name a few. Ticket to ride is an ok game if you do not have any good alternatives :)

It's been over 10 years since I added this game to my collection and I still enjoy it.

I don't know if it is the ultimate gateway game any longer, but it still is in the top 5 in that category.

It does suffer for being a little too long. I wish it was about 15 minutes shorter. The only other complaint is when the train cards are mostly not wanted by most players and the game drags on because of that.

My first board game beyond the likes the Monopoly, Risk and Cluedo!:) I am impressed that a game doesn't need rolling of dice to play, haha. My wife who is less than luke-warm to board games also love the game after being cajoled into playing the game. The game mechanics is attractively simply, and I think it is a perfect gateway game for all non-gamers. However, after several plays, I find that players tend to focus on building their own track only, and thus the game lacks interaction and excitement as a result. How well the game plays out is therefore very dependent on the group whom you play with.

already a classic
plays nicely like a light family game should be
quite abstract

I don't quite get why you put chains of wagons on the board in this game. It's not a train (without a locomotive) and it's just to symbolize that you control that link. It feels wrong not to use something more abstract like colored wooden bars (e.g. like the old wooden road pieces from "Settlers of Catan").

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

This is a great gateway game there is no doubt about it.  It is also one that my wife enjoys so it hits the table more often than others.  Although I think I like Marklin better this is one I always bring along when introducing new players to board games and so far it is NEVER failed to capture them.  This game does not hit the table as often any more as other games are preferred.

Despite all of the hype about this one, I have to say, it fell flat for me. I just didn't find it interesting.  It's a bit too abstract for my tastes.

This is a wonderful gateway game.  Simple rules and fun to play.  I do certainly enjoy Ticket to Ride, but sometimes there seems to be a bit too much luck involved when it comes to destination cards.  There  is a bit of a bias towards longer routes.

Rules are simple enough for non-gamers, so this is a great game to introduce to anybody. Still it has some excitement as you hope for your routes not to be blocked before you can build them, which keeps it interesting.

RATING: 7
I like this particular version with more than two players, unfortunately I only get to play it with 2 players usually (my rating isn't based on this, but does account for it being a two player game that is not great at 2). The board and cards look good, though the theme is a little meh. Still a somewhat fun game with a fairly simple concept and that is fairly well designed. Pretty good game to introduce to new people and a decent game to pull out now and then in general.

Broke down and bought this without having played it.  Once I started playing it online, though, I was glad I did.  Like a number of games, this one probably won't have frequent/lasting plays (I can play it for years, but not frequently), but it is fun and non-gamers will get it.

And it turns out my kids LOVE it and want to play it nearly every week.

RATING: 5
After two plays. There's a luck of the draw with the ticket cards. You won't come in last from a bad hand, but you won't come in first if one player has a nicely set up hand. On top of that, players who don't have good cards and try to get better cards can be punished and make matters worse.

The game can be redeemed to a 7 for me JUST with a rework of the ticket system. Maybe this will be fixed in a second edition.

Plays pretty well with any number of people -- Fast paced, with interesting decisions to be made.  Along with Settlers, this is a good intro game for new gamers, as it's relatively straightforward to learn and thematically relatable.  We play with a house rule where we divide the tickets into 3 piles according to value, and give each player one ticket from each pile to start.  This prevents someone from getting a ton of long routes and another player getting screwed by getting all short routes.

RATING: 7.5
Ticket to Ride is a weird situation - sure, there aren't tons of decisions to be made, and you're really playing something akin to Board Game Rummy.  But I think it has the "Take that!" factor that people want to see in games, without it being too complex, making it the perfect game to introduce to new players (SoC and RA are other successes).

Update:  This has become one of the favorite games of my game group, and I have to admit, I always have fun, even though it isn't as strategic a game as it could otherwise be.  Increased from 6.5--->7.5.

While similar in mechanics to Alhambra (hand management to obtain sets), it offers an entirely different approach. I do wonder though, if the 1910 expansion will become necessary if the game is played too much and people learn all the possible routes off by heart.

This is probably the biggest gateway game I've found to introduce new people to the concept of modern board gaming. It's fun, it's light, it's easy to learn.

It's a lovely social game, as they're aren't many game mechanics, and you can easily play with a group over some drinks and not worry about things getting too complicated.

Usually after introducing people to this game, and playing it a few times, it's really easy to get them to pick up something like Carcassonne, Settlers of Catan, or even Power Grid.

Must play with the 1910 expansion the next time.

Ticket to Ride will never be one of my top 10 games, but there really is more to this game that at first appears. You have to be able to predict the other players' moves and block aggressively. You also have to build your network while anticipating your future ticket draws. Putting all of these elements into a perfect play can be fun. But ultimately, this Rummy variant isn't my most preferred style of game.

You've got a Ticket to Ri-i-ide...
hey...where are you putting those trains...NOOOOOOOOO!

If I am going to teach a new gamer or a younger game how to play a board game, then this is the game I grab. THE Gateway Game!

Simple Rules. Start play right away. Even if you are doing poorly, you are still playing and having fun.

I have multiple expansions and variants. The only one I did not enjoy was TTR: Marklin. The passengers took something away from the game for me.

Starting off with this rating after only having played two times with kids. I've enjoyed the game to this point, but I've not played with my regular, adult gaming group.

My rating was arrived at by trying to match the BGG recommended ratings as exactly as possible. I do enjoy it, and would like to own it, but not enough to prioritize it higher than others in my limited game budget.

This is a great gateway game for anyone, and works well in a family. The strategy is more solo, not much player conflict or interaction, but there is a little. The trains (components) are a little dinky, but pretty cool. There aren't a lot of options for strategy, and the game has a good amount (but not great) replayability. I have TTR Europe, which is a little more complicated and I enjoy it more, but for starters, this is a pretty good game.

I loved this when I first played it, and it really hooked me in. I played it over and over for a few days but quickly became fatigued. It's an interesting and different experience when not used to connection games but I don't think there is much of a game here. I particularly don't like the ticket system, where you are pigeon holed into building a certain way and then you are penalised for drawing more choices of tickets. I understand from a gameplay perspective but it really drives the player with limited choice, and the game is so quick the tickets do little but that. A little random but not too bad, bit of strategy in what cards to pick and when to play them, I like that about it.

Ticket to Ride is okay, but not the spectacle I was expecting after the hype. Bad destination ticket draws can really mess up your game. I also think the game repeats itself too much - it's the same from start to finish: you draw cards turn after turn, then you play them and then you draw again - repeat ad infinitum? Highly overrated game. If you want a good Moon game, play Union Pacific or Elfenland spiced with Elfengold instead.

My lack of respect for this game, contrary to my wife's beliefs, is that it's a bit elementary, though still fun (I'd just rather play Bohnanza if I had the choice for a light game). Her suspicion is because she beat me like a red-headed drum one night when I decided to keep all the routes I drew midgame in hopes of completing them. I miscalculated the length of the game and lost the gamble; this is her favorite gaming story.

Fun gateway game. Who doesn't love playing with trains? Seems overly simple at first, but the strategy becomes more complicated and compelling over time as you find the most lucrative routes to complete your ticket, guess and sabotage your opponent's routes, and keep them guessing about your own routes so you don't become vulnerable to sabotage. I've heard some people say they play "nice" in this game, but doing that is actually what initially turned me off to it--if you're not trying to screw over your opponent, you're just picking up cards and setting down trains. Even with it, it can get a bit repetitive if played too often, but it's still a great game overall.

One of the first Euros I bought and one that is so easy to explain to newbies. There is certainly luck to the draw of tickets, but good players (I'm not one of them) have a tendency to win. The strategy when playing with different number of players seems to differ, so I think I need pay attention to see what works and what doesn't work. The USA 1910 expansion is absolutely essential as it creates a lot more confrontation, which is much appreciated by everybody I have played with so far.

Any game that starts off with ten-minutes of hand-building is a snore-fest. I am not surprised that this game fell flat for me, as I also do not like Union Pacific, another set-collecting game that relies on the tension of the "Should I push my luck and take more cards or play the cards I have before it's too late?" decision. But since both of those games are wildly popular, I guess it's an effective mechanic.

Rates just below Marklin, simply because Marklin is a bit better balanced, is more strategic, and includes more risky routes.  Much more enjoyable when played with non-gamers.  Most gamers have games they'd rather play than this one when at a convention or game night.  Rating reflects thoughts when playing with a mixed crowd.

Update:  I realized that this game is the best of the gateway games.  I have never had a bad time playing it, and every single person that I have introduced to it to has loved it, from anti-gaming in-laws to fringe-gamers.  It is not deep nor it is it terribly strategic, but it works so well.

UGH, this f*cking game. F*ck this game, man. So dumb. Yahtzee, Clue, Pente, Othello; Hell, I'd rather play Shoots and Ladders or Candy Land. Catan was brilliant because for the longest time, non-nerds thought anything at or beyond Monopoly or Risk level were "too complicated", regulating we gamers to playing dumb baby stuff with them. Then Ticket to Ride came out, and some IDIOT was like "It's the new Catan!" and everyone acted like it's a game of substance and strategy when it's dull as dishwater and simpler than Forest Gump. If I could erase a board game and all memory of it from existence... well, actually, I hate Liar's Dice and Apples to Apples too, I guess, but this at least makes my top 3 most hated popular games.

Not only the best "gateway" game ever created, the TTR series might have the best rules of any game in recent history. The games are simple, play quickly, have great components, and offer a ton of fun choices. The American version is the most simple version of the game, but is also more competitive because it is easier to block other players. It is a better 2 player game than the European version.

Now a family favorite, often the "headliner" of game night, this is THE game which first opened my eyes to the appeal of designer board games. The simple rules, intuitive gameplay, and use of the widely understood set collection mechanic make this the perfect gateway game. I can't imagine a better platform for introducting others to the hobby. 

I've not attempted to play with less than 4 or 5P, but have found the game to be equally good at both of those player counts. I imagine the fun factor would likely decrease with lower player counts due to the lessened competition over routes along with the loss of the associated tension that would entail.

This is my go to gateway game for new board gamers. It is simple to learn, the strategy is easy, and its fun to play.

As I have played different boards (Europe and Nordic) the American map has lost all interest to me. The best strategy is usually to race for all the 15 point routes and see if you can connect a 20+ destination ticket. Additionally the board is so open that we have dubbed this game "Ticket to Silence" as we have almost zero player interaction.

Played it again and it had a sour taste. For Trade.

I am clearly in the minority but I don't enjoy this game. It makes me tense. There is the perfect card sitting there and I have to wait while some schmo picks it up just before it's my turn.

I understand this is the design and it is enjoyed by many. I'm just saying I don't enjoy it.

That said, I really would like to own the deluxe version with the awesome train minis. I need help.




Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 1
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 1
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 3
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 3


Overall - 1

A great, great gateway game and still fun to crank through with experienced players.  I played nearly a hundred games of this online, but only log face-to-face plays here.  The intuitive rules and clear goals make it a perfect game for new players, and the playing time is reasonable as well.  The game is somewhat flexible for different groups, since people can play (mostly) friendly, or really work to cut each other off.  I like this better than TTR: Europe, but not as much as TTR: Marklin, TTR: Switzerland or TTR: Nordic Countries.

Train game that's actually an elaborate rummy game (but that's okay). I find it lacks the tension of my favorite Alan Moon game, Union Pacific, with it's random scoring cards. Interestingly, others have stated the exact opposite (they think UP lacks tension). I had no need to own this, but it is a great game for non-gamers, so I couldn't pass it up when it went on sale at Tanga.com. Damn you Tanga!

This is a favorite family game. It's very accessible (our 6 year old daughter is able to play competetively) while still having a solid strategic backbone. It's not clear who the winner is until the end, but there is a sense of a "leader". There are numerous opportunities to surpass the leader though the further behind you are the more you have to gamble to catch up (trying for ideal destination tickets, blind draw for locomotives, etc.). This game is a standby for us and a favorite to play with non gamers.

RATING: 7
Letter Grade: A.  A modern classic family game.  [05-08-09]

So elegant and simple it's ridiculous no one had thought of it before Mr Moon.  Looks like it's fairly nonconfrontational with two, but at the very end of the game, when tension is heating up as players are attempting to make their final connections, the map gets crowded and can make for some last-second nail-biting offensive and defensive moves.  I could see experienced players having a bit of an edge in that familiarity with destination tickets could clue them in on what other players are attempting to connect. Holds up with any group or number of players, though the end-game tension increases markedly with more players, as the opportunities to make those last few destination tickets dwindles rapidly. 

9-2-08: From 8.5 to 7.  I'm still attracted to this game, partially because of the scale of the map, partially because of the components, but I can't see myself suggesting it with anyone but new or less-experienced board gamers.

12-24-07: Reflecting on Tatsu's comments, would be willing to try this again with really experienced TTR players to see how it changes things.  Perhaps too easy to pigeon-hole this game?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
I think this game is finally clicking.  I know it's weird I get RftG in my first play, but TtR takes like 7.  I'm different what can I say.  I still like this game a lot though, it seems very counter-intuitive for me at least, which means it is more interesting to play.

Edit: I've gotten to play this enough that it's dropped a little in interest for me.  I think Europe or at least the 1910 Expansion would bump it back up to 8-range.

This is exactly what most people say it is... a very simple introduction to "designer games". I think the enjoyment level is determined by how mean you play the game, the meaner the more fun it is... Otherwise it's just a matter of luck and making sure you don't pick up the wrong card.

A good game that can be played with 2 or 3 people, but I would definitely recommend getting together 5 people to maximize the fun and the challenge.  Since you're competing for limited resources (there's only so many routes going to any city) this game can get rather intense pretty quickly.  Haven't had an un-fun game yet and I doubt I will any time soon, would definitely recommend this to others.

It's apparent that it does come down to the luck of the draw with ticket cards. If you get a few routes that overlap, and no one plays aggressive enough to stop you, you hold a descisive advantage.

Ticket to Ride is the only game I know whose rules fit comfortably on 3 faces of paper.  Front page, back page, next page front, that's it.  Every other game I've played is 10-12 pages of rules, which isn't a bad thing, but it's remarkable that any game can be created with such simple rules.  On top of that, it's lot of fun as well, which gives it a high replayabilty value.

Neat little set collecting game. Plays like rummy on top of a train map.
subtle screw your opposition tactics abound. The initial draw of tickets makes a big difference, perhaps too much so. However, nice and lite, and my son loves trains. The guys at work love this one, and it plays in an hour which is very nice for a Friday afternoon.

A game that I can't help but rate highly for its beautiful properties.  Incredibly simple and elegant, and yet not as light and luck-based as it might first appear (although it is definitely not a 'heavy' game).  Your kids could play it with you, it's that simple, and yet still a real game.  It's short, downtime between turns is low, and set-up is generally pretty easy so long as your significant other can shuffle cards (thankfully, years of working on a card game for PhD finally improved my ability to do this drastically).

I enjoy playing it just to relax with some great company while drawing cards and laying out trains,,, hopefully winning in the process!

A great game for beginning gamers, but a little devoid in strategy for advanced gamers. The best method to win seems to be ignoring tickets, trying to claim the 4-5 train routes and going for the longest route at end game. It gives a real sense of satisfaction when you block that one route your opponent requires to complete a ticket.

A lot of quick, easy fun for my wife and I to spend a bit of time with in the evening. It also works great for non-gamers or light-gamers to introduce them to games other than [i]Monopoly[/i]. However, I would [u]highly[/u] suggest using the [i]Ticket to Ride: USA 1910[/i] expansion with the game to improve some aspects of the game.

It's very fun. The cards are way too small. I plan on getting the 1910 expansion.

RATING: 6
Every turn is a new decision.  I like decisions.  Great as a gateway game.  Second only to Settlers in my opinion.  However, with my normal gaming crowd I have no desire to play this again.  After being gated this has little to no replayability.  Its a game I would not hesitate to give as a gift to a non gamer or relative.  It does not have enough meat to be a game I typically care for, and it takes too much set up/time to be a filler.  Its a well designed game that misses my tastes.  Ironically this and Settlers drove me to this site.  I have no nostalgia or appreciation I guess.

Stupendous game.  There is just so much fun to be had in crafting these different rail lines. I love the game and haven't played a session yet that wasn't great.

UPDATE: Still playing TTR thanks to the 1910 expansion this is the best of the series.

This game is a winner. When I opened the box I was wowed, and then I read the 2 pages of rules and was wowed. From the first laying down of a track, this was a runaway succes. It's a grand gateway game, but the luck of tickets drawn brings the game down a click.

Not my favorite in a bunch of gamers, but a very good choice for family or casual play. I can explain the rules to my Mom! I think the ticket cards versus laying track are pretty well-balanced options; taking new ticket cards early-to-midgame can open up a chance for some big points, and it's a gambling hail-mary late-game play.

RATING: 9
This is a really fun strategy game. When played with two, you can really concentrate on your routes. When maxed out at 5 (or more if you have teams, which we have done), you need to be fast and sneaky. Scoring is easy with the score board lining the game board and a score legend on the board. The trains are cute and the destinations memorable. The only downside is the smaller cards; if I buy this game then I'll look into the expansion pack that replaces them with full size cards.

I do have to say, that it is a fun game, easy to teach, and it is good if you want something for everyone, and you want to give your mind a rest.  So it is what it is said to be: a really really good game for all.  And you know the train theme is not so bad after all.

[Rated 2005/04/18, based on 23 plays]

Very easy game to get on the table, non-gaming family and friends are always happy to play.  A good gateway game, as it's possible to pick up quickly, but almost everyone I've played with has started thinking more analytically as we've gone along.  (I've seen Rummy players take to it well, deducing what people are collecting and taking it from there.)

Played exclusively with gamers, it's something of a different game, and much faster-paced, especially on-line.  Still great fun, and I can happily play several games back-to-back when they're clocking in at around the 30 minute mark.

Great components, have yet to try the community-produced additional maps, but the quality of art that people are putting out seems very high there too.

RATING: 7.5
A great gateway game. Compared to Marklin, it is lighter, quicker, and less strategic. There is also more potential for getting hosed and having some intense competition without passengers to bring in extra points. We like this version because it is much easier to finish in a short amount of time, compared to Marklin.

Over time, this game has become a drag for me. I still like playing, but I don't like that every game feels like a game of "who will get the luckiest ticket draws?" The game seems to lack player control, offering little payback for good decisions. This has taken the rating down to 7.5 for me.

The other reason this game has worn on me is that it gets requested so often. As a result, all of the other good games in my collection receive less love. I do like this version more than TTR: Europe, but I'd rather play Marklin anytime.

An essential gateway game.  It is the perfect balance of simplicity and strategy, and I have had great success introducing this to non-gamers.

The gameplay is a bit too simplistic for me to want to play it all the time, however.

A simple game to learn. Some element of luck may be involved with regards to blind draw of train cards and destination cards but yet strategies need to be formed in order to find the most efficient route between 2 destinations. In addition weighing between when to draw train cards and placing of trains can be critical to the game and finding alternative route in situation of blockage. More fun if played with more players as it add more excitment to the game.

With elegantly simple gameplay, Ticket to Ride can be learned in 3 minutes, while providing players with intense strategic and tactical decisions every turn. Players collect cards of various types of train cars they then use to claim railway routes in North America. The longer the routes, the more points they earn. Additional points come to those who fulfill Destination Tickets – goal cards that connect distant cities; and to the player who builds the longest continuous route.
"The rules are simple enough to write on a train ticket – each turn you either draw more cards, claim a route, or get additional Destination Tickets," says Ticket to Ride author, Alan R. Moon. "The tension comes from being forced to balance greed – adding more cards to your hand, and fear – losing a critical route to a competitor."

A decent system of gateway games, but I think there are better games in the series than the base game (such as Marklin).

In the base game, the long tickets dominate lots of short ones and the map has just a few too many choke points, so play can get very nasty.

Further, the hoarding strategy seems a bit too strong in the base game.

I have trouble finding opponents for most of the games I have, but this one keeps hitting the table.  Ideal for a light game.  [Update: 50 games later, this still gets requested more than any other, and I strongly disagree with those who bash the game for being unbalanced.  There is quite a bit of strategy, if you care to look for it, and 6-routing is NOT gamebreaking.]

I like the polish of the game, and certainly it's a game you can get most anyone to play.  

But my problems are the following:
1) It's too simplistic and lacking interesting strategy to be worth many plays with experienced gamers
2) It's too long, especially with 4-5 players (a family) which is really the only time I would play it.
3) Even less experienced gamers, who may otherwise enjoy the game, begin to feel the drag. 

I really don't get this one.  The luck factor is high, and while I enjoy the thrills of blocking someone (as they enjoy blocking me), I feel I have too little control. 

Is it a terrible game?  No.  But it's certainly not one I pull out frequently.

I have the Steam version. It was the first "modern" board game I played, and I still love it a lot, even though we don't play it as often as we used to. Sure there's luck, but generally it evens out, and that just contributes to the variability.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
It's simple enough for my eight year-old to grasp strategies of completing destination cards while not being too rules heavy. Having to draw the correct color of cards adds a chance element to it that has burned me in one game, but it is countered by the locomotives as wild cards. If you've got pre-teen children, this is a fun game to play with them.

RATING: 7
Good:
-Gateway game
-Builds great internal tension
-Every game plays differently
-Plays well as a two-player game

Bad:
-A little too long for what it is
-Routes deck is a little too random
-A ton of short routes isn't truly a viable strategy
-Rewards for long routes are too large

Overall:
Makes it very clear what you need to do.  Then, uses race mechanics to build excellent tension and build nerves about getting everything done before it's too late.  Gives players the freedom to explore conservative and risky strategies.  I'm usually willing to play but would rather play different or shorter gateway games.

While Agricola might be a deeper game, it cannot match
Ticket to ride in elegance and cleaness of mekanics, which is the main criteria for becoming a classic game. I
think this game has a good chance of outliving us all. It
manages to use set collectiong and point to point movement in such a deep and elegant fashion. There are just a few other games like this that aint abstract and still manages a pureness of mecanics, I can only think of
Aquire and Puerto Rico at the moment.

I want to like this game, but the mechanics are too simple in my mind. Large ticket/6-car advantage is hard to overcome.

After a year or so, I downgraded this game. It is just too boring.

After a couple more years, I upped the rank...mainly because I have come to appreciate the simplicity of this game as well as the ease of teaching newbies. I find that if people have fun playing a particular type of game, I tend to up the rankings a tad bit to adjust for the   subtle yet but important "social fun factor"

Played at Origins 04.  Ah another lesson about pre-conceived notions.  I signed up to play this with a friend at Origins, but I was a little nervious about it.

Update: Played again for the first time in a few years, this time with my kids. It's still a great family/gateway game, though I still don't have any desire for it to become more than that when there are so many deeper train games out there.

This one gets my vote for the ultimate gateway game. Not as nasty (or as subtle) as Carcassonne, easier to explain and more flexible in number of players than Settlers. However, I think that in the long run it's not as interesting as either of those two competitors.

RATING: 9
The game is simplistic in nature but has a large element of strategy.  One must make a compromise between efficiency and time as you attempt to lay train tracks across the country before your opponents.  As long as no one abuses the '6 rail length' strategy the game is great for both new and experienced board gamers alike.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
There are precious few board games that can be taught in under 5 minutes while still being fun to play.  A really good gateway game for a mixed group of players.  I've never seen a player upset during or after a game of Ticket to Ride, it is always a safe choice.

I'm a fan of how the board changes its track mechanics to accomodate more players.  However, I don't like how the *complete route* cards are largely luck-based in the end game (but that is a minor quibble).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is a solid game that is reasonably deep, all things considered. The game plays pretty quickly, even with 4, and tends to stay fun and competitive. This one is particularly good at bringing people into the hobby. The gameplay is a touch repetitive, as the number of actions you can do a turn is extremely limited, but it's fun in its simplicity.

Another fantastic Days of Wonder game. A little light for my taste but, as an intro game for non-geeky friends and family, it has no equal. Blinged out with some lovely Mayday Games wooden train pieces and the cards from the 1910 expansion, it's a 9/10.

Update - This is one of the funnest and quickest games that my wife and I play regularly on our iPads. Quick, enjoyable, and fun. I don't record those plays on here but they are many.

Awesome game for beginners and established gamers. The very straight forward rules does not lessen the strategic play and enjoyability of the game. After repeated plays it has slipped a bit in my ratings (from 9 to 7.5) but it has its place and is enjoyable enough to keep things going! It would probably go up a bit once I get the 1910 expansion.

My first rail game. A good family game and a great intro for the kids and non gaming friends. The game play gives just enough depth and the rules can be explained quickly. Play is balanced and not much down time. Lots of tension( and frusration) for the kiddies as they find their plans thwarted. My kids have benifited as it really needs you to have alternatives in place just in case.  When I ask what game should we play tonight the cry is usually the one with trains! DoW have as usual done an outstanding job on production, beautiful artwork and excellent tactile components all add to an enjoyable gaming experience.

I can only comment on the 2-player variant, as I usually only play games with my wife (or try desperately to, anyways...). Not a very confrontational game, as we find that it is only beneficial to block one another when it is convenient. The first game I played with my wife, she beat me terribly. She has a longest route train extending from new york to miami and then to LA, completing 3 routes in the process. I think she didn't find the game to be mentally challenging enough, so it was just "ok". You basically work towards completing the destination cards, and pick among your cards to make sure you dont get stuck with negative points at the end of the game. While it is a beautiful game with great components, I don't think it is best with 2, because the board is too big to lead to enough confrontation to make it a challenge.

RATING: 6
Okay, okay, I'm a convert, but the rating is still a 5.  This one is a keeper, will probably be played for years to come, and has an accessibility that makes it a good non-gamer-introduction-to-european-style-gaming game.  However. . . it is somewhat fiddly with the bits.  The train metaphor is a thinly camouflaged Gin Rummy variant.  The game can have good player interaction, with both offensive and defensive plays to block other people, but most of the time each player is playing soley for themselves and pays less attention to other player's actions.  This can cause player interaction to become significantly low.  And for a more family-oriented light game, TTR inspires very little table talk.  On the whole, the choices and decisions you make in TTR don't seem as important as they feel in other games.  Still, it's more than a diversion.

A favorite of my late wife's, where she showed her most strategic side.  I love the simple rules, and the fast turns.  I think it's a more interesting game with the 1910 expansion: there are too few tickets in the original game, and if you play a lot, you'll get to know those tickets too well.

Affectionately known as "the train game" one of the quintessential gateway games. A rummy-based set-collection card game with the addition of a "geographic" component. Intuitive to learn, simple to play, yet strategically sound. Has a little of that "screwage factor" inherent in the competition for  available routes - that said one is never really out of the game because several routes can be taken to complete tickets, though some take you quite the long way around. Components are superb. Cards are a little small but functional but that can be corrected with the expansion.

One of our favorite games.  Great for getting new players into Board Games.  Fun because it involves a lot of quick planning and strategy to complete your hidden objectives.  No one really knows who is going to win until the very end!  Often we have the person in last place end up in first!

Why so many plays when I don't rate it that well?  Cause the wife loves it and it's pretty much the only game I own she'll play with me at any time.  
Update:  My brother and his wife and kids came to visit over a weekend in November, they all really like TTR so I let them take it home with them.  I plan on getting it back some day when we go to visit them.

Strictly holding to the base/original ticket set this is suitable for family play but it feels unfulfilling for friendly competition among peers, a disappointment. A player dealt a one of the longest tickets  almost always turns out the winner.

First explorations of TTR:Europe appear to provide MUCH better balance - seems to offer a more cooperative map and ticket set.

Rules are simple enough that nearly anyone can play, but it retains enough depth of strategy that good play will inevitably win.

This is not our favorite of the series (that goes to Nordic or Europe), but is one we had to have just because we love the series so much.  If you do get this version, I highly suggest getting the USA 1910 expansion for larger cards.

Pros:
+ Easiest version to teach because it has the simplest rules/mechanics.
+ For US players, there's less frustration about not being able to figure out where cities are.

Cons:
- Lighter than other versions, which is not necessarily a negative for everyone like it is for us.
- Artwork isn't as nice as in later versions.
- We don't enjoy the layout of routes on this map as well as others.  (Again, personal preference.)
- Comes with small cards.

Used to own before our house fire, was a good game, but after playing it so much there are definitely "always win tactics" that make it less fun for others. It's definitely worth owning as younger players can join in, but we will probably not replace it as we just played it too much.

I've primarily played the digital version.  Hard to understand what's great about the game until you've played it a dozen times or so.

It grew on me.

Ticket to Ride is to me, the perfect gateway game. There is skill and strategy in play, but plenty of luck and chaos, too, so anyone has a chance to win. Turns are very fast, and you can always do something on your turn, so you're never bored. There's a slow build up of tension too as people start to crowd the routes you want, threatening to take it from you!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A classic. Very fun. I love the risk/reward decisions you have to make when you choose new tickets. Sometimes it feels like you're getting nowhere when you have a hand full of cards and the deck is just not giving you want you want, but that's just the nature of the game.

I like how I can either focus and play hard(ish), or I can just kick back, eat chips and salsa, and make conversation while I play at the train game.

I really enjoy this game and have sucessfully introduced it to casual gamers. I like the decision making that I go through when managing my hand. I also like adjusting my plans when available routes are taken. The randomness of tickets does influence the game outcome a little too much, but with experience it feels like that can be minimized. I have played some [gameid=14996] and enjoy this original game design more.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Moon's famous "draw from x face up cards or the deck" mechanic, distilled into its purest form.  I haven't had the success that so many have trumpeted when I introduce it to non-gamers.  My working hypothesis is that the strategy involved in ticket selection is a little bit too subtle to really absorb until the second or third play, so many of the new gamers don't really understand why they lost.  If the desire to play a train game hits me, I'll usually opt for TtR's meatier older brother, [gameid=94], but this one is a moderately satisfying lighter alternative.

After fifteen games, I can say this is a good and quite an easy game to learn. All the players must be more or less at the same level for the game to be really enjoyable. I think this original version of Ticket to Ride is the best (I have also played the Europa, Märklin and Nordic editions). In the right company, this is a really challenging and nice game to play.

The game is intuitive, players want to build routes and building routes gives points. Quite straight forward and easy to understand. Great game for non-players, good game for players.

I have yet to show this game to someone who doesn't like it, and though I probably prefer to play other, deeper games if I have the choice, it's hard for me to imagine turning down a game of Ticket to Ride (unless it's Märklin, or unless I have the choice between it and Age of Steam).  Even if the draw isn't coming my way, I still enjoy playing.

A great game, but a bit stressful given the opportunity other players have to bugger you, even unintentionally.

I understand this is a great gateway for many and I'm sure there is a great deal of strategy I'm missing but the only element of interest choice seems to be the gamble of selecting tickets.

RATING: 5
One of the most overrated games ever. Also the rules to Puerto Rico was easier to understand then the Ticket to ride ones for me. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
With elegantly simple gameplay, Ticket to Ride can be learned in 3 minutes, while providing players with intense strategic and tactical decisions every turn. Players collect cards of various types of train cars they then use to claim railway routes in North America. The longer the routes, the more points they earn. Additional points come to those who fulfill Destination Tickets – goal cards that connect distant cities; and to the player who builds the longest continuous route.
\13\\13\
The rules are simple enough to write on a train ticket – each turn you either draw more cards, claim a route, or get additional Destination Tickets," says Ticket to Ride author, Alan R. Moon. "The tension comes from being forced to balance greed – adding more cards to your hand, and fear – losing a critical route to a competitor.

RATING: 7
Ticket to Ride gets loads of praise for being a great gateway game and it's easy to see why. The rules can be explained in minutes, yet there is enough decision making to keep even serious gamers interested. Another nice feature is that it can be played either casually (just score points) or aggressively (by blocking routes), so it's great for playing with non-gamers and younger children. Although no one in my group owns a copy of Ticket to Ride, I get to play all the time thanks to X-box live. Indeed, I think I like Ticket to Ride better as an electronic game, since all of the tedious card shuffling and display refreshing are taken care of by the CPU, not to mention there are always a bevy of online opponents to play. Solid game.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Very simple to learn and to play. Loads of fun, but can be very frustrating as you may spend multiple rounds simply drawing cards trying to find that one card you need to complete a specific route. Tons of fun with just two players but highly recommend having as many people play to amp up the competitiveness. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This game fixed all of the problems I had with Thurn and Taxis...and it came out first. Funny, that. Anyway, the game is really enjoyable. Like Carcassonne, it's nice in that players have the option of playing viciously or not blocking each other. The tickets add a good amount of tension, and the game moves right along. I've never played with the expansion, but I actually like the small cards; since there's no hand limit, I'd imagine that larger cards could get unwieldy, especially with low player counts. I feel like replayability with the same group might be a little lower than I'd like, but that's a very minor complaint.

Our kids like to play this game. So if you have kids, try this one!

There is more to this game than what meets the eye. I know one player in my gaming club who wins this game often... In fact I played 3 games with this guy, he won them all. He knows all route-tickets by head I think... He builds first, draws route-tickets and has huge scores on them. I don't play this game often, so I have trouble to find the routes from the tickets :). They don't give me much scoring...

If you like this game, try Union Pacific. I prefer Union Pacific. For me far more evolving. In this game I know all the routes combined with the shares :). Ha, great game Union Pacific!

This is a really great Euro that I was just about the last person on the planet to actually play.  Frankly, I expected it to be bland and simple.  Instead it was nicely tense and strategic, with plenty of competition for lines and cards.  

It's not really fair for me to compare this to other games in its class like Settlers, as my number of plays for the two are separated by a triple digit number, but right now Ticket to Ride is the gateway game I'm most interested in playing.

RATING: 5
It's simple and accessible, but there's not much more to it - overall I find Ticket to Ride to be pretty underwhelming (considering its almost legendary status). There's just not enough interesting decisions here (even by the gateway game standards). You just draw cards, slowly build your hand and hope that others won't block your routes (and trust me - the game can get pretty cutthroat in this regard). 

The starting hand of bad tickets can really hinder your entire game. Not only that -  experienced players who know the highest scoring ticket cards inside-out have a huge advantage over novices as they can predict what you are doing and block you accordingly (as a novice you are put at a disadvantage just because you don't know what to expect from the tickets - this game rewards "experience and memory" over skillful play and I'm not a big fan of that).

I would rather play Quadropolis or Splendor if I were to suggest a great looking gateway game. Even Catan is more interesting and involving due to negotiations and trading aspect. 

I don't hate it, but I'm far from being amazed by it. I understand it has its fans though, it's just not my cup of tea.

I keep wanting more out of this game, the more I play it.  Like a pick up and deliver mechanic or something.  I need to give the other TTR games a try and see how much they improve the game.

Once more a game with simple rules that is rather engaging. It doesn't give me the agonizing choices feel as in some other games, but still very fun to play. I do feel like the board is too crowded with 5 players. With 2 players, there is little interaction, but it's still enjoyable. Don't compare it with Union Pacific because both games play very different. You could say it has similarities with TransAmerica, but it doesn't replace it. UPDATE: Sold it and replaced it with the Marklin edition as it provides more ways to score points. Note that this doesn't mean I don't like the base game, as I think it's an ideal game to introduce non-gamers.

Ticket to ride is one of my favorite games. Players are given tickets which represent train route which they need to complete for points. By collecting and playing sets of different colored trains players can connect cities, and the farther the connection the more points it is worth. It is a simple game, but with a strategic  play structure that makes it a lot of fun.

I was originally going to give this game a 7 but that would be wholly unfair seeing as how it is probably my staple game. I think that this should be a gateway game moreso than Settlers of Catan. In fact, I love it so much that it is the first (and so far only) game I play online (other than Blue Moon, but that's just to get the hang of it). I guess I just like the simplicity- all you're really doing is collecting and completing tracks. Although my lack of focus on bonus points, like for the longest road, is probably why I never win. Case in point: I came in second last online. But it was still fun!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Even though I typically don't win this one I still really enjoy playing it.  For me it's fun to see what routes I can complete and how effectively I can play with the tickets I have drawn.

Bought this for my wife as a belated birthday present the other day. She's a gamer too but since the kids were born, they leave her little time to play.

Ah, the game every self-respecting gamer should own. The quintessential gateway game, TtR truly shines and gets really tense when you're playing in tournament format.

The game that started it all for me. This game is a fantastic family game. I've taught this game to dozens and dozens of people and have turned people who aren't into board games at all into pretty big board gamers, all thanks to this game. Every person who has played it has loved it. Once you play it for a while you can tell exactly what routes people have. Getting poor routes to start can severely hurt your chances of winning which is why I only gave it a 9.5 instead of a ten.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I enjoy this a lot.  It's a great game that bridges the gap between gamers and non-gamers -- and probably helps to transform many of the latter to become the former.

I probably prefer Ticket to Ride when I play with non-gamers, and Ticket to Ride: Marklin when I play with gamers.  It's not that they can't handle the Marklin edition, but I find that it's an easier sell with the basic rules without adding in passengers or stations or tunnels, etc.

I don't own a copy, but my father and my friends do, and this has proved to be one of the most enjoyable games in our library. We have made a house rule that places three tickets (after everyone has received their initial supply) under the edge of the board. When the game is over, these three "mystery routes" are revealed. If any player or players have completed one of these routes, they get bonus points.

Muy buen juego. Es muy fácil de jugar, las normas las aprendes en 2 minutos, las partidas son muy entretenidas y no se hace nada repetitivo. Muy recomendado.

Para dos se puede jugar pero es mucho más fácil hacer lo que quieras en el tablero sin apenas molestarte, lo ideal es 3 o 4, porque ya estás chocando mucho con el resto de la gente y yendo a por rutas similares.

Elegantly simple gameplay with intense strategic and tactical decisions every turn. Collect cards of various types of trains to claim railway routes in North America. The longer the routes, the more points they earn. Additional points come to those who fulfill Destination Tickets & goal cards that connect distant cities; and to the player who builds the longest continuous route.

RATING: 6
Keeping mainly because it's such a good gateway, although I find it a bit repetitive for my taste. 

15/01/'17: Decided that in spite of its new-player friendliness it isn't worth keeping for us because I don't ever feel like playing it. The main reason for this is the limited play - draw cards to collect a set and play a set to lay trains, with a bit of route building on the side. I always felt like there was something off in the tickets mechanic since they seem really important but actually aren't, and short tickets are not worth it - like they don't score enough or something. Playing with the expansion helps because you can use just the big tickets, but essentially the game is uninteresting because of the limited decision making round to round. Hand-management and tempo (do I build before you) are really the only ongoing gameplay and while it was fun for a bunch of plays I think I am played out.

A perfect family game and a great gateway game to lure your non-gamer friends in to the fold.

I find this game enjoyable as long as the player count is kept low; you do so little on your turn that it's intolerable waiting to go around the table while people agonize about their minimal choices.

A couple of friends loaned us their copy, and I played it with the kids the next day. Great fun, and the kids loved it. 

After playing twice, I have a little more perspective. It can be a slow-moving game, and with four people it can take an hour or longer to play. If that's what your looking for, this is a great game.

Looking forward to trying the expansions and other variants.

The poster child for gateway games. A good game, but not without flaws. After a few plays it becomes apparent that whoever draws coinciding long tickets (usually coast-to-coast) will be much more successful. Then there's the tactic of just taking as many 6-length routes as you can to speed the game to its end. Outside of those two options, one of which will be determined by chance, there's not much else to do.  An innovative game system re-implemented better in future versions, including the great USA 1910 expansion.

Excelelnt train game, and with a good perpetual online ladder running on Age of Wonder website if you are short of people to play.  Of the four (TTR, Marklin, Europe, Switzerland) this is my favourite, the board layout is excellent, there are plenty of long routes to build (Europe and Switzerland are short on these) and it avoids the overcomplexity that Marklin introduces for little additional play value.  if you havent played it yet, try it!  the only downside is that most experienced players hoard cards and build late - but a hand of 30 cards is awkward to manage and easy to spill, so teh online version is recommended.

Possibly the best game to introduce people to the hobby. Very simple rules. Literally draw cards, place trains or take extra tickets.

Growing up, even if people did not play games, they owned a Monopoly set, as it was a game that was available everywhere, with rules easy enough for anyone to play, yet challenging enough to raise it above just a kid's activity.  Ticket to Ride is a near perfect game that has the same qualities.  It has only a few rules, and can be taught in a few minutes.  Easy to do, yet challenging if the opponents are experienced.  With add on maps to add complexity and the fact that this appears now in mass market locations,  hopefully Ticket to Ride will be around a long, long time.

RATING: 8
With very simple rules that anyone can pick up on, even the village idiot, Ticket to Ride and its sequels are games that every aspiring board gamer should play. The original is the simplest and strikes closest to home (considering the map is America). However, the Marklin edition feels faster paced and a little more cut throat, with a few more dimensions of depth added. The Europe addition is an adequate sequel but the hassle of ferries and tunnels just made it a little less enjoyable than it was worth.

Nice accessible game, easy to teach to new people (gamers and non-gamers). I consider it the 'new Settlers of Catan' in terms of fun game it is to a lot of people, and it's a great game for introducing people into the boardgaming hobby that never really played games before or are used to games like patience, monopoly or scrabble.

The theme isn't the most sexiest, compared to Settlers of Catan, but it is a shame to hold that against this game.

It's the old staple that almost everyone has at least heard of.  The colorful board and trains draw people in, and the rules are very easy to understand.  I prefer more players in this version just because of the size of the map -- with 2p it's very easy just to stay away from each other so there isn't any competition for routes.

{ P - 2 3 [4] 5 }

You have to give Mr. Moon some credit here. Of the big four gateway games (Ticket, Settlers, Ra, Carcassonne), his wins out. After dissecting every materially different starting draw (base set only - with a larger, expansion-inundated deck of Tickets the game is much worse because players can never infer if certain tickets remain in the deck as well as the probability and necessity of getting them) and how players would thus begin the game, one should figure out that a spinal route is usually optimum. (The route extends from Calgary to L.A. to Pitt to Miami, with endpoints truncated if necessary, e.g. tickets in New York or Montreal. A secondary route folds back on itself slightly to encompass Duluth, and requires the black six to coexist with the aforementioned.) The only other possibilities include central tendencies of geography in either the west or east (these players need to acquire some strategic routes to pinch the spinal folks) or two "big" tickets that are almost exactly the same route. (Lucky contestants here can simply come on down, there's not much you can do to prevent SEA-NY + VAN-MON and the brevity with which they can be completed.) I even mapped out the optimum routes for all west/east as well as basic countermeasures against traditional players and break points where routes can be shortened given the absence of tickets to cities like Santa Fe or Chicago. As you may have expected, this game has lost its luster for me, but hey - at least it's not Ra.

The appeal is beginning to wear off. Still a good choice to introduce new people to the hobby but maybe I've burned out on it now

Allright, after a dozen games, I'm dropping my rating to a 7 from a 9.  This games scores high marks for its components and simple rules.  Non-gamers can pick this up in a flash and it's a great way to get them hooked.  BUT... this can get monotonous.  Draw cards. Wait.  Draw cards. Wait. Lay down trains.  And if you draw a good set of route cards at the start, say a couple of medium to long routes with similar start and end points, you have a huge advantage.  This has developed into a long filler for me.  Fun but not hugely rewarding.

I don't get TTR either...

So it's a set collection game, Okay... I don't really see the game here. You draw cards and play them to build lines, you want to connect cities but people might cut you off to spite you or because they need to go there... I really must be missing something.

Such a simple game that can really take a lot of strategy to be able to win.  Sure there is luck involved in getting the right train cards and drawing route cards but there is much more to it than that..Love playing the game...very easy to learn, especially since i already knew all of the cities.  Would recommend this to anyone that wants to try something beyond their 1990s board games...

The version I have is actually "Ticket to Ride. Europe." This is a solid game. You have to capture roads to connect various points on the map. One road cannot be used by different player, which leads to a competition between the players.   The resourses for building become available sort of random, but the amount of randomness involved is just right. One of the main sourses of risk is that you may take as many "orders" for connecting cities as you wish, but if you cannot fulfil the order then you get some points off. There is a variety of strategies, the game has a certain combinatorial element and it's fun.

Admittedly I was pretty disappointed with TTR after my first game.  Sure it was easy to pick up and teach, pretty fast to play, but it didn't really feel competitive, there was no real risk involved.  There was very little strategy besides trying to claim the most direct routes first, people don't go out of their way to block others unless it was something they need.  Maybe this was due to the fact that we had only 3 players, I'd imagine the game probably gets more hectic and plays better with 4 or 5.  Anyway, a filler in my eyes at the moment, and not a very satisfying one at that.

After one playing, I can say that I really enjoyed it, but I am a little disappointed.  I was expecting the "be-all-end-all" of middleweights, and I don't think that this is it.  Maybe I'm missing something, but it doesn't have that "oomph" that I look for when playing a game.  This could conceivably change with more playings and/or playing with different numbers of people.  I can certainly see the multiple paths to victory here... Update: I can take this game or leave it; if someone suggests it, I'll play...but I won't be the one suggesting it. Update: I seem to be going through a love/hate relationship with TtR.  Rating increased from a 5.5 to a 7.  I've been wanting to play this one recently.  Why? :)

Love Ticket To Ride, love it so much that I'll play you right now if you don't believe me. Don't buy into this "ooh there's no real options, you have no real choice, it's all in your head" baloney that gets tossed around a bit. Here's a real option for you "get off your horse and go someplace else."

RATING: 8
A great game! I think in 20 years this game will be what Monopoly is/was - the "classic" game that everyone has and everyone likes. 

I just wish there was some mechanic to help fix the "stale board" near the end of the game - when the face-up cards are not needed by any particular player, so they never get taken and thus never get refreshed. The players who are looking for a specific color just draw random cards hoping to hit what they are looking for, which takes away some of the fun for me (it's annoying to lose just because you couldn't find that last orange card you were trying to get for 6 turns in a row).

Choo! Choo!!!!  My wife loves this game and so do I.  I am sad though since I lost a card the other day.  Beware playing on decks with cracks!!!!

Edit:  The problem of the missing card was solved with the purchase of the 1910 expansion.

Edit: My wife and I play this quite a bit, and I would say it is definately one of her favorites.  We play without blocking which kind of reduces the skill factor some, but it still manages to be enjoyable.

Fun on iOS, but a bit too light for me to play regularly.  I enjoy passing the time at work with the iPad version though.  The Europe map is more fun and challenging than any of the US variations, at least in the computer world.

Here's a game the whole family enjoys. We play it all the time. Even my wife who doesn't like boardgames plays this with us. And we've even corralled some of our kids' friends who have discovered modern games are radically different than what they were introduced to as children. Truly a great gateway game.

After 1 Play: I've played this and TtR: Europe, and I think I prefer this, though they are very close.  I like the risk of being totally cut off from a city, which the Europe version does away with.

After 2+ Plays: Still a decent game, but I prefer Marklin (or Nordic Countries with a small group).

My son's favorite just got to be a favorite of mine. Of course, he is three and toys around with the trains and the cards. I gave this one up for the teeny one. How could I not? Certainly the board has been in for one rough ride, looking rather crumpled nowadays. It is worth it, it has to be.

This is the game (along with Pandemic) that got me interested in board games again. It offers an amazing introduction to the wider world of games and serves as an excellent antidote to the childhood horrors of Monopoly and Risk. With easy to learn rules and great replay value, this game is a must-have. I highly recommend getting the 1910 expansion, with which I rate this game a solid 10. With the 1910 expansion, we play Ticket to Ride all the time and it is still our main go-to game when we're looking to play something.

After 2 plays, I don’t understand the hype surrounding it. Yes, it’s a good game with nice bits, but it lacks of originality. I found it repetitive, a bit boring and much based on luck of the draw. I preferred  my 2-player game to 4 players. My rating might go up if I find that the game is deeper than I first thought. 

***Edit*** I've put stickers on my board in order to know all possible destination tickets routes. I prefer to play that way and I changed my rating for an 8.

***Re-Edit*** I can't stop playing this game and I really enjoy it with any number now! Stickers on the board were a great addition and it has completely changed my appreciation of the game.

Gatway-игра. То есть, из разряда Колонизаторов - только до нас пока ещё в широком масштабе не дошла. Имеем колоду цветных карт, из них можем строить дороги между точками. За длину дорог получаем очки, за выполненные секретные квесты по соединению удалённых точек - тоже очки. Компоненты отличные, но общее впечатления от игры, будто бы она сложнее, чем на самом деле. 

Минусы - довольно проста, но сетап не маленький и количество компонентов превышает идеал довольно сильно.

The go to gateway game. So simple and yet so fun. The amount of contingency plans needed to do well keeps this game interesting for experienced gamers, while the simplicity of the rules and the straight forward and focused objectives makes it easy for non-gamers to pick up. Only complaint is the small cards that come with it, which are very hard to shuffle.

Deemed as one of the modern gateway games, it's basically rummy beneath the façade of a train theme, though truth be told, the trains only serve as player markers. The game is played on a map of North America and your objective is to complete as many rides (multiple and specific connections between cities) as possible while using different-colored cards as currency to pay for these connections. Though much lighter than Settlers of Catan, I definitely recommend TtR for non-gamers. Strategy is dependent on luck of the draw and plays out wonderfully with a full 5 players. I wouldn't label it to be a must have or a must play. (7 after one play)

Played only on X-Box 360.  I can see why TTR is considered a great gateway game.  It's easy to learn and play.  For a fairly serious gamer, I find that it isn't really tactically deep enough for me to play all the time.  I do like the game enough to get the expansions when they come out on the 360, especially since it seems like they change the game enough to make it play with a bit more depth.  

The bottom line is that there are better "connect cities" games out there that I'd rather be playing (like railroad tycoon!).  But it's a nice distraction online when there aren't real people around to play a board game with.  I doubt I'd play the board game version of this very often at all, but I play the heck out of the console version!

Archipelago is a prime example how to seamlessly merge mechanics and theme. One of the most beautiful and thematic games I have ever played while remaining very strategic.

It has its fair share of flaws - rulebook could have been much better. Complexities are found where you don't expect them, sou you have to reach to the FAQ more often than I'd like to admit. But, we love it despite all that.

Juegazo juegazo MAYUSCULO, de los mejores de gestión de recursos/acciones! Parece un eurogame pero tiene elementos de otros juegos. Muchísima variedad, bastantes cosas que recordar y muchas opciones en tu turno, pero todas ellas basadas en reglas sencillas e intuitivas. El arte gráfico muy bueno, 4 partidas cortas a 4, y 3 medias a 3 y 2, y otra larga a 3 jugadores, que me han dejado encantado y reafirmando que es un diseño de juego sublime! Una de ellas con semi-jugones. Escala bien, y la duración pues es muy variable, pues depende de que se cumpla uno de los objetivos de fin de partida. Comentan hasta versión en solitario (que nunca me ha atraído) que esta bien. Obra maestra sin duda alguna entre los juegos de mesa.

I was very interested in trying Archipelago since it caused so much exploding rage and bursts of anger at the boardgame club previous week. Personally I was not part of that game but the repercussions were felt at our table as well. It was hard to believe that a game could be as bad as it sounded.
 
Now that I have played I can say that it is not bad. It is just boring with a number of annoying elements.
 
First issue is with the fragmented rules and mechanics. There are so many things you can do that all are relatively simple as themselves, but since they very loosely tied together, you are facing a mess that takes quite a lot of time to explain. Moreover, all paths you can take are very short which results in a game in which you do a little bit of everything. I reckon, this works well with the hidden scoring and game ending conditions but does not really give you a feeling of actually accomplishing something. If you play with the scoring cards openly visible to everyone, the game is even more boring. You are just repeating the two to three actions that allow you to take very small incremental steps without ever achieving anything bigger. To add to the misery the game is so low scoring that you are absolutely disappointed. You play for 2-3 hours and get, what, 7 victory points? It might be just me but I do not feel satisfied.
 
Second issue is with the playability. I absolutely detest games in which you have to be craning over the table in order to read that minuscule text on your opponents' cards or the cards on the display. This creates a lot of downtime since everyone will be doing it on their turn. Furthermore, the board looks quite busy and it is really hard to tell the building tiles from each other without closer inspection. I do not have bad eyes but still I struggled with gathering all information I needed.
 
Third issue is with the cooperative aspect of the game. I think it is supposed to work as a catch up mechamism, but since you cannot easily tell who is winning there is no real incentive for you to do anything because you do not know whether you are actually helping yourself or the others. Thus it comes to the responsibility of players last in turn order to decide whether to continue the game or have everyone lose. This works against my concept of meaningful decisions. I can think of an easy fix, though. The rules could enforce cooperation, i.e., you have to help if you can and thus would be paying for being allowed to play first. But I am not sure how this would change the experience.
 
There are some positives as well. Exploration and tile laying is fun. And you can choose to push your luck, which is usually exciting. However, in Archipelago exploration can be extremely frustrating as well because there is a big chance that the tile simply does not fit anywhere which results in an action lost with the game stalling. In my opinion this is a very dangerous avenue in game design. There is a high risk of losing potential fans if they are too well smitten by chance on their first plays. Moreover, I feel that the game should progress with every move and on every turn. Too much stalling just makes you lose interest.
 
I can see that Archipelago requires a new way of thinking and traditional approaches to eurogames are not appropriate here. Personally I am fine with this and I am very flexible with my playing style and can adapt to most games. But if you have to tell everyone at the table how the game should be played for it to be fun, something is terribly wrong.

Both times I have played this, the game has included the role trying to sabotage the players in order to win that way and I feel that role is imbalanced compared to the others. I'd be keen to try this with 4 players trying to co-operate but I'm not a fan of house ruling games.

Archipelago is a semi-cooperative game with a nice twist. Players have to cooperate in order to keep the rebellions low where everybody looses, but at the same time dont want to share too much for the crisis in order to gain as much VPs for them alone to win the game. Great euro-style game with thematics and nice mechanics.

A good game with a lot of theme. I was surprised at how much I felt like a colonial governor and the myriad of problems of running a new colony, with new world and old world problems. The pieces are beautiful and there is negotiations and player interaction that is most satisfying. 

Downside is it takes a while to play. The short game variant that is too short and does not give the game mechanics justice in my opinion. And some people might not like the backstabbing or negotiations that can be done in the game. And also if someone finds themselves trailing a lot, they can sabotage the game by causing the revolt in which all loses but that is group specific. 
 
Overall, I personally enjoyed it a lot and the theme is really immense and makes it a winner in my view.

FAVOURITE GAME - One of my favourite euros and byfar the one with the nicest design. It combines tile placement with worker placement and a bit of bidding. Basically you have to explore, build up, and then manage an island together with your fellow players. Then you have to trade goods to receive the almighty gold to be able to expand. A nice edge in this game is that you never know when it will end, since at the beginning everyone has a secret objective which once accomplished triggers the end of the game. Besides, it has a short, medium term and long playing version so it can accomodate novices and hardcore europlayers too.

The game looks great set up, and the expansion aspect is very nice to look at.

The game suffers in that 3/4 of the end game scoring is unknown, so at the moment the game ends, you have no idea how well you've been playing or if your strategy is working. Add to that the fact that scores are extremely low, and the end result is a 3 way tie with the player who had the best built civilization ending in last place.

RATING: 2
One of the worst games of all time.  The semi-coop in this game is completely and utterly broken, as there is no reward for attempting to prevent the group-loss condition, and in fact, making any attempt to prevent it will result in opponents who are not trying to prevent it becoming massively, uncontestably ahead of you.

Additionally, turn order bidding is outrageously broken, with the winner of a blind bid determining play order for ALL players, and being allowed to then take bribes from these players, while the other bidders actually lose their bids to get nothing in return.  So lets say one player bids '5' and another bids '4'.  The player who bids 5 goes first, can actually gain resources back from the others by accepting bribes, making him net pay LESS than the '4' bidder, and then can shove the '4' bidder into last position.  The '4' bidder loses his money.

When a "game" breaks uncontrollably when played by players who understand games and try to win, then it is a failure that should not have made it through playtesting, and its developers and playtesters have failed in their duty to present a playable game to the public.

If you can get this to the table, you are persuasive enough to be in politics.  I've played it a few times, and it's great fun.  It's detailed, rich, and the semi-cooperative mechanic gives you some tension in your negotiations with other players.  However, the pieces and rules are so daunting to new players that you might find yourself apologizing from the start.  I'd like to play it more.

RATING: 6
There's parts of this game that I like a heck of a lot, and then there's parts that outright annoy me and drag the whole thing down. It's a mixture of shocking highs and lows to my own personal enjoyment.

I really, really like everything about the tiles, exploration, gathering resources, constructing buildings, variable VP goals, the markets, and all that good stuff. 

Conversely, the turn order mechanic is bleh. I've never liked a single semi co-op element in any game I've played so far (including here). The end game mechanic can be very annoying when it's suddenly over and you don't even have a chance to finish the round. And perhaps most egregiously, I find myself uninterested in the type of gameplay required to utilize the cards and negotiation aspects well at all.

There's a whole game of manipulating the card market, watching what people buy, and buying the many nasty screw each other cards that counter what everyone else is buying/doing. You can also use many of the cards other people purchase, opening up lots of room for even more surprising play with them. That, combined with all of the potential political maneuvering and bribing leaves a wide field of choices to play a game I'm not all that interested in playing. Negotiation is purely un-structured--allowing virtually anything. I personally find freedom in boundaries, whereas I detect the potential for madness with all these options.

Maybe the aspects I dislike aren't as bad as I think and repeated play would get me used to them. But the nastiness of cards and grubby politicking that this game asks for is not my style, and I feel like it impedes my enjoyment of the rest of the fantastic mechanics. So overall I'd currently rate my experience as just decent.

Explore a new world and exploit its resources, though not too much or the natives will revolt and we'll all lose the game.  Now that's quite a neat idea.  Unfortunately, Boelinger burdens that concept with a whole bunch of sub-systems. Even his bells and whistles have bells and whistles.

The idea of offering different game lengths by modifying the game end conditions is another neat one.  Just be aware than game length can remain quite variable and that the short game is prone to fizzling out just when you're getting a handle on all those fiddly mechanics.  

The artwork is quite pretty, though it is ridiculously difficult to distinguish native huts on the land tiles.

Hard to know what I think. I did very poorly on my first (and only) game after making some poor decisions (and misunderstanding some rules, to be fair) early on. I like some elements of the game, but I also didn't like some of the graphical design (particularly the action selection board). Overall, not my favorite. I would try it once more to see if it could be redeemed, but I won't suggest it.

Enjoyable game about exploration, settling and trading. Very thematic euro game with great artwork. The game has variable lenght and different victory conditions each time. I need more plays to find out if the semi-cooperative aspect works. It seems to me that it does.

Archipelago is probably the most beautiful board game I have ever seen and this is one of the reasons it gets a high rating. The game play is engaging and for those who like secret objective and mind games it might be an awesome experience. I must confess that I prefer the Euro-games with no hidden information, but Archipelago was still a pleasant experience. The rules are a bit heavy for the this kind of game and I had a hard time explaining it while the game play flows smoothly but ends abruptly when a player reveals that one of his end of game conditions was met. 

Overall I am not profoundly impressed by Archipelago, but the quality of the components, the replay value and the awesome graphics are adding together to a game that I will for sure play again.

EDIT: after 2 more plays, rating decreased to 6. Nothing more than beautiful components.

EDIT: nothing more than beauty. I am considering re-writing the victory conditions and the whole card mechanic from scratch using existing components just to use the very nice graphics.

Good example of a game where more is certainly not more. Including many different mechanisms in the game doesn’t necessary provide a deep and good game. The most annoying feature in the game was the hidden scoring and game end criteria. The player may be driving the game to its end without knowing, even if it is not in his interest.

A strange game of negotiation/development during which I easily got bored 2 times.

I understand why some people like this a lot, but the same aspects of gameplay they find awesome, I find they are meaningless and frustrating.

The fact that I can appreciate 2-3 innovative mechanics (despite I don't like them) is the reason why I rated this game a 6. In BGG scale, this would be a 2-3.

The only thing that still keeps me a little interested in this game is the solo-mode, which theoretically wipes out all disadvantages of the game. I could try it.

To be honest, I found this a bit of a disappointment after seeing the components, which were of top quality. The gameplay was slow with too many bitty rules, and the game ended rather suddenly (when the 6th - location - card was bought) which did not help. There seems to be an attempt to cram too much into a single game, which dilutes the whole experience, for example, about 70% of the actions/buildings/etc I did not use in the whole game. I would like another play before deciding on a final rating, however. After the second play, it went more smoothly. Losing actions on the explore option could be considered a game flaw, but it must be intentional to simulate the time spent by explorers to find land.

RATING: N/A
The first (and so far only) time we played it we were too much focused on managing the various boards; there was hardly any cooperation or player-interaction which this game made a name for. So I'll have to play a couple more times before I know exactly what this game has to offer.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a gamers' game with a cornucopia of mechanisms, perhaps too many, all thrown into a reasonably thematic game.  The first time play is rife with trouble as there is just so much going on.  

It feels like perhaps this game should have shipped with rules describing a base game, then an intermediate game where additional mechanics are added, then an advanced game with all the mechanics. Too many things in this game as far as I am concerned.  I particularly dislike the rebellion mechanic and the iconography and symbology used in the rebellion mechanic.

Still, there are some interesting decisions in this game once you get past the tangled thicket of things that are going on that you frankly just don't like or care for...so you ignore them...undoubtedly at your peril...and possibly...eventual major league annoyance...like the rebellion mechanic.

Ambitious, as close to a "sandbox" game as you'll find. While the concept is interesting, the game itself feels half-baked, lots of ideas that aren't executed well enough to make the play as tense or interesting as it should be. A few of the mechanisms are just terrible, like the auction for turn order where you lose your money regardless of whether you win or lose the auction.

I'm not against the idea of a semi-coop, but I think it's poorly done here. Many of the actions you can take to stop the rebellion have no benefit to you, they only help other people. This is always a bad idea in a mechanic.

One play with a friends copy.  Beautiful game, good production quality and a nice amount of tension to be had.

First: we're here to help the islands prosper
Second: We're here to make money and fulfill our own secret goals
Third: we're here to make more money than our competitors while completing our secret agendas before they do.
Lastly: we're here to do all the above while keeping the natives happy enough not drive all the non natives out of town.

So if juggling those political axes while settling a vibrant island chain sounds up your alley, archipelago may be right for you.

Decent little exploration game. Works okay with two players but the game feels a little too short even when using the "Long" game objectives and missing a little something.

A unique semi-cooperative, civilization game that needs the right people to make it fun. I love how it incorporates many euro mechanisms while keeping a strong thematic feel. Plenty of options you can take as you try to build a strong economic engine while working towards your secret objectives and working with the other players to avoid an uprising. Absolutely beautiful artwork.

I'm not sure how I feel about certain aspects. Negotiation, while it adds a lot of player interaction and another layer of decision making, lacks structure since you can negotiate about anything at any time. There's also not enough incentive to give up your own valuable resources if you can get the other players to do so.

1/28/2015:  There's a solo expansion out that's apparently pretty good.

12/1/2012: I'm definitely a fan of longer civ building games.  I definitely like this one and prefer it over Sid Meier's Civ.  It has a nice tech tree, and a variety of raw materials.

I was surprised to find that resource scarity is a factor in this game.  Our first short game with 5 took 4 hours and I'm looking forward to another play with fewer players.

To me it seemed a little spongy.  I was thinking that it could be tightened up a bit by reducing the number of choices.  One one hand it feels a little long, on the other you really don't get as far as you want before the game ends.  I do agree that there can be swings in the victory points based on the hidden objectives, but that seems to bother me less than most.

Definitely prefer over Sid Meier's Civ.  Need another play to compare it to Through the Ages.

Amazing game. A part of a Euro that has no boundaries. It's a free form game that is devilishly difficult to wrap one's head around, because it just doesn't really run on rails, so to speak.

Finally have racked up enough plays of this to give it a fair rating. 

It's a sprawling, thinky economic game that introduces way more player interaction than your average euro. It is a game everyone should play.

EDIT: Revisited after a while away - the rule book is mediocre - some things aren't explained well.

 Juegazo. Una vuelta de tuerca adicional a los euros. Un pedazo de juego cooperativo, inmersivo, precioso de componentes, con mecánicas curiosas... para mí un acierto.
 Lo primero es ganar al juego ya que la dificultad estriba en cooperar y sacar adelante la pacificación de un archipiélago que no perdona el más mínimo despiste.
 Lo segundo es tratar de ajustar tu estrategia para ser el campeón. La mecánica del mercado externo e interno... es ahí donde se gana al juego, el resto es para ganar la partida, creo que las posibilidades de que el juego vea mesa son enormes. Otras mecánicas que me tiene chiflaico son la eleccion y el rotar las cartas de personajes o estructuras, las condicones ocultas me chiflan, la importancia de las negociaciones con la puja por el primer jugador o el qué cartas rotar... y que los finales seas tan cerrados en puntos. Y los componentes...!!!!
 Ojala todos los años Bolenger editara un jueguito...me tiene enamorado

Loving this game a lot right now. The exploration feels great, it feels good to start out your colony and build with some initial cool combo's. I also think the hidden goals and the other modular pieces help to keep the game at least fresh enough to be willing to play it more than a couple of times. I think how it changes between cooperative and competitive are great. Overall this feels like a really smartly designed game, very inspirational. So far have just played with my partner (2 players) and am really looking forward to playing it with more to find out if the traitor and pacifist mechanics are any fun.

Rég volt ennyire felemás érzésem egy játék után... A sok szép alkatrész és az érdekes a szabály ismeretében úgy álltam neki, hogy nagy élmény lesz. A téma is megfogott, és tetszett az is, hogy nagy szabadságot ad a játék, kevés szűkös akció van. Kifejezetten izgalmasnak tűnt az előkészületek alapján. És maga a mechanizmus is kedvemre való, néhány ötletes újítást is találtam: a kártyák árának változása pl. nagyon elegánsan van megoldva, a licit is elég egyedi. Látszólag minden a játék mellett szól.
De: néhány kör után rájöttem, hogy a játék hosszára vonatkozó bizonytalanság nekem nagyon nem tetszik. Nem tudhatom, hogy 1 óra múlva lesz-e vége, vagy 5 óra múlva (más ilyen játék is van, Düne pl., de ott valamiért tolerálhatóbb ez). Az egyes végefeltételek bekövetkezési valószínűsége közt nagyságrendi különbségek vannak. Persze jó a titokzatosság, de nekem ez így tervezhetetlen. A játék igazolta is a félelmeimet, mert egyik akcióm közben a játékostársam váratlanul bejelentette, hogy MOST vége... Túl komplex ahhoz a játék, hogy ilyen lutri vége legyen szerintem. Ezt max egy fél órás játéknál tolerálom, vagy esetleg más műfajú játéknál. A másik ami zavart, hogy a kollektív vereség pár körön belül megakadályozhatatlanul bekövetkezhet, ha valaki arra hajt, és mivel van egy célkártya, ami erre ösztönöz, ezért teszteletlenségre gyanakszom (ezt a kártyát nem ajánlatos belekeverni az elején, mert megölné a játékot). A kollektív vereség réme egyébként akár még érdekes is lehet, de mivel nehéz azonos terhet vállalni a veszély elhárításából, kérdéses, mennyire igazságos utána győztest hirdetni. További hiba, vagy inkább megint csak teszteletlenség, hogy az alacsony végpontszámok (8-10 pont) ellenére nevetségesen apró dolgokon fordulhat meg akár 3-4 pont sorsa is... Nem tudom, hogy a titkos célkártyák, vagy a fél-coop jelleg öli-e meg a játékot, de valamiért nem az igazi. Komoly játékhoz képest túl sok benne a lutri, komolytalan játéknak meg túl hosszú és összetett (közel 2 óra volt a szabály). Ha egy mondatban kellene a játék lényegét összefoglalni: Gyönyörű és ígéretes játék, de nem vagyok benne biztos, hogy tudatosan több pontot érek el, mint totál random lépésekkel:)
Érdekesség: nálunk az nyert, akinek messze a legkevesebb embere volt.

A quite complex worker placement/resource-management//tile-laying/dudes-on-a-board civ-ish game, slightly on the heavy side of rules (especially for your first time or if you have a long time to play). Interesting mechanisms, vibrant colors and quite a few choices to be made here. Serious and highly replayable (thanks to the characters and hidden objectives of each player). Not something to play everyday for sure, but I can definitely see it hitting the table once every now and then, especially with my eurogame-loving part of the the gamegroup.

Hmm. I expected more from the game. I will give it another chance but I was not impressed.
One concern is that one can not imagine that this game is an economic game with unemployment as its theme.
Another concern is that a player knows only partially the endgame scoring coditions, so it is totally random who will get the vps at the end of the game.

I played as the traitor, and I can see some good mechanics there. 

Another problem imo is the existence of two different markets: I didn't see a need mechanics-wise for two markets instead of one, it is confusing.

Overall unfortunately I personally did not like the game much, although I have to say that is very subjective. Some of my co-players enjoyed it.

Archipelago is at the same time an ingenious work of art and an utterly broken piece of design.

The semi-cooperative part is what drives my excitement for the game, and the main problem as well: with little to no incentive to prevent the common loss for the trailing players, it can easily fall apart (and it almost did in my first 5-players game) if the players don't embrace the design philosophy behind it.

Behind this great and crazy idea, there is also a brilliant design: action selection (á la worker placement but not quite), exploration, resource and market management... Everything falls in place to create an epic game, with a rich narrative and a great story arc.

There is lots of replayability, guaranteed (beyond the exploration tiles) by the trend and hidden objective cards, as well as the three different durations (even if I wouldn't bother playing Archipelago in the short version: there is no time to guess other players' objectives).

The only thing I really don't like is the blind bidding for turn order, with the winner determining all the positions.

In the end, I'd like to play it more to form a coherent and solid opinion about Archipelago. After just three plays, the tentative rating is 7.5, but could really go up or down based on its mastepiecery or brokenness... Which one will prevail?

Great - I wish I got to play it more. A thinky exploration game with Euro style resource management.

Excellent semi-competitive setup. (I don't mean semi-coop). You are in competition with everyone, however if everyone doesn't keep the population happy, then they revolt and everyone loses.

Plus the end game is partly hidden, with every player having an end game condition and scoring objective.

The semi co-op just didn't work for us. At first it was surprisingly difficult to explain, and after the game ended we didn't feel like we have won together and Person A performed best. All but Person A felt like having lost the game.

Furthermore there a bunch o things I consider un-elegant and not intuitive:
- workers sometimes have to be lied sideways and put up again, just to lie them sideways again in another phase
- the double sided improvement/crisis cards, where some crisis trigger immediately but others just in certain phases
- buying an improvement becomes a great risk because you at the same time reveal a new crisis card (this makes the game very punishing)
- the losing player can tank the game and force a all-lose scenario...


But it looks gorgeous after the game has ended and the archipelago has been explored.

Played it seven times with my two brothers. This weekend all our girlfriends were away. We started to play Saturday at 20.00 until 6.00 in the morning. We agreed not to play another one on Sunday and went to bed. At 13.00 we started a third game - and had a blast.

This game is great. We didn´t get the Separatist yet, maybe that could be difficult to handle. The rule books in German and English leave a lot to be desired, even the French one is not great - but the game is. Oh yes it is!

After Earth Reborn and this one Mr. Boelinger is becoming one of my favorites.

Edit: Have to update it to a 10. After not playing it for some years we came back to it and it still is as great as ever. Included the War and Peace expansion.

This game has so many things, great mechanics and lots of interesting decisions to be made each turn with so much to do. It's almost impossible to know where to start. Sure, the semicooperative aspect can break the game depending on the type of people you play with, but... it's awesome. Combines very well tactics, strategy and cooperation (or not) in a game about exploration and colonization. No two games will be the same, with the differents secrets and mains objectives.
But despite all this qualities, the game is long and slow. And after 2-3 hours, you feel that you haven't done anything. I am really lukewarm about this game.

the unpredictable resource requirements to activate workers and resolve crisis events make me hate this game. If I can plan for it no problem. Having to guess and hope feels like bad design.
Also the "co-op" component in a competitive game does not fit at all. why would I give up an advantage.. makes the last player the screwed one.

Archipelago is great.  I have enjoyed the challenges of the game.  Archipelago can be played in several different ways.  It can be played competitively, with the players actively trying to thwart their colonial neighbors.  I have also played games where each colony keeps to themselves.  The game facilitates both styles of play.  The game is very deep and enjoyable.

Archipelago is a pretty fascinating game. There's an interesting marketplace mechanism, exploration of beautifully illustrated tiles, and a need to balance every action against the native population's tolerance for your colonial meddling. The best part, however, is trying to work out the secret victory conditions from the actions of everyone else around the table, and then trying to figure out if one player is actually working against the group and trying to incite rebellion. How to work around the Separatist, balancing your need to score points against the need to keep the game alive, is perhaps the trickiest part of the game to get to grips with, and after several games I must admit I still haven't got a handle on it. I keep wanting to come back to it, though, so it must be doing something right!

Too long to be so random.  Throw in unnecessary rules overhead in what is, at its heart, a medium weight game, and it can be tedious to learn and play.  Knowledge of the scoring cards is necessary to play well (or luck into it) as the game mistakes obfuscation for tension.

Production is very nice and there are some interesting concepts but I would never choose to play this game again.

I like this game a lot but I've had mixed experiences with the people I played it with. Some loved it while others didn't like it. 

To me this game is a bit of a godsent because it has a lot of those 4X mechanics that I love, and at the same time it plays in under two hours which makes it easier to get on the table.

Another thing that I like about it is that every game feels very different because of the various evolution cards. One game might be a compact little archipelago with plenty of war and tension, while the next game might be a huge series of islands where everybody has plenty of land on which they can live and grow peacefully.

My advice: If you want a game of strategy instead of luck then use the Open Goals variant from the rulebook. That way everybody know what to go for. Otherwise you fulfill your secret mission and then you'll have to guess what the other player's missions are.

One of the very first games I owned. Way back before I started to register game plays. And it's still my favorites. The art, the exploration part, the semi-coop part, the possibility of a 'traitor', the whole design it's all right up my alley. 
Although after some plays and gaming experience I must admit this game has flaws. Mainly it concerns private objective cards. The end game conditions are not at all balanced. Even for a short game they vary very much. Getting to 30 citizens for 4 player game is way faster than building 6 ports. It means that in the game without some conditions the short game could last 2h longer than with them. 
The other thing is that private scorings differ too much. Holding to exploration tokens is way easier than building a lot of ports. So the player with exploration objective has a big advantage if he manages to not give that away.
The last thing is the coop part of the game. It can stir the emotions. If there is a crisis that has to be prevented sometimes someone has to give more than the rest. And if later he feels that the rest is not giving that much to the common cause it can be frustrating. And you have to remember that this is a semi-coop so first and foremost everyone is being selfish. It's not necessarily a drawback but something worth keeping in mind.

A very nice civ game, with a lot of things to do (maybe too many). The mechanics are interesting, maybe a bit complicated for non-hardcore gamers.
I cannot say I don't enjoy it - on the contrary. But it always stays in my mind after a play as too long and with cards that can create unnecessary combos, without point-scoring in the end.
It is fun (or insanity) trying to figure out each others goal - maybe one mechanic I really loved here.
Note: I have not yet managed to play anything else than short play goals.

I'll need more plays of this to see how sustainable it is.  It may just be that I score this game a point higher than I might simply because I love the theme so much.  

I'm neutral to the hidden aspects of the game, though I do like the tension that develops as players try and guess what their opponents are doing.  In the way it's designed, playing without hidden objectives (i.e. having all objectives visible to all players) would make the scoring very uninteresting, as one player could easily dominate.  The hidden objectives encourage players to do a bit of everything.  However, this shines most in a four player game.

The thing I like least is the bidding system, where the loser of the bid loses the money.  Not a huge fan of that mechanic.

18-Nov-12: Initial thoughts after 2 plays (1 short 2 player, 1 medium 4-player that ended in revolution).  

This is probably my favorite macro civ game (which isn't saying too much).  It removes conflict and replaces it with negotiation and hidden objectives.  It also adds in a significant market aspect while removing the tech tree.  This makes it unlike any other macro civ game I've played.  Of all of the recent games I've played, this one has the steepest learning curve, not just for one player but for the entire group.  After a couple of plays, I think the market is very important.  Having goods gives money for buying cards and people and having goods allow players to prevent revolution from ending the game.  On the other hand, buildings are also  likely to be winning conditions (i.e., VPs) so ignoring them is risky.  

I think the short game is only good as a teaching game.  The medium game is probably fine with higher player counts, but with 2, I think the long game is necessary to ensure adequate player interaction.  Negotiation is necessary but I don't think this game suffers too much from a "gang up on the leader" issue (besides the blow up the world option -- see below).  

It feels like a game where players play the other players as much as they do the game.  That said, with the randomized hexes, cards, and objectives, there should be a good amount of replayability.  I may prefer to play with open objectives, which will maintain the variability but decrease some of the uncertainty (not a bad thing, but I'm not sure I like it in a 2+ hour game).  

One issue with the game is the "blow up the world" option.  If a couple of players are convinced they're losing, it is relatively easy for them to either cause everyone to lose or force the leaders to shoulder the burden of continuing the game and give those that are behind a chance to catch up (of course, if they don't say anything until they decide to blow up the world, the leaders may have no chance to stop them).  

The rulebook also has some issues (i.e., situations not addressed) but I expect in time BGG will answer these problems.  

I am not sure how often I'll get to play it, but I did enjoy my couple of plays.  I may end up keeping it as my one macro civ game.  I'm still not sure and will need more plays to decide.

Juego de gestionar a unos trabajadores en un archipielado, para ir consiguiendo recursos y con ellos construir edificios e ir acercándote a tus objetivos. Cada jugador tiene un objetivo secreto (que puntuará para todos), con lo que tienes que andar con mil ojos a ver qué hacen los demás.

Además, es semicolaborativo. Todos los jugadores deben velar porque los habitantes no se rebelen, porque en tal caso pierden todos los jugadores.

Está muy bien pensado y los parámetros del juego se relacionan unos con otros de maneras indirectas que hacen que sea complicado preveer las consecuencias de tus acciones, en conjunción con las de los demás jugadores.
Orientado a jugones, sin duda. Dificil de explicar y complicado de dominar,pero muy absorvente y divertido.

Interesting game but the short game can be way too short, and the negotiations are kind of weird for euro players. I'd like to try again the mid-length version though. I'm giving it an 8 as that one has potential to be more interesting.

Très bon jeu. Première partie a 4 joueurs. Il a fallut 3 tour pour que le jeu clic pour tout le monde, mais après ce fut une belle balade semi-coopérative.

L'Indépendandiste nous a tous planté et nous ne l'avions pas vu venir.

C'était vraiment une bonne partie.

Very nice game to look at, and I like the hidden agendas, but something keeps it from being great.

I have hope that the solo expansion rescues this one.

A really interesting blend of mechanics. Area control using modular maps, resource management, complex economic choices within both domestic and foreign markets, plus the unique rebel and unemployment tracks make this game unlike any I have ever played. I really like the game play, the beautiful components, and the theme.

With that said, however, why oh why did they make the rebels black, represented by a black pawn, and offensively portrayed as primitive "barbarians" sticking their tongues out? It's just horrible, far worse than the slaves in Puerto Rico, and almost ruins what is otherwise a really good game. I will never understand why that artwork was approved and am personally considering pasting a different picture over every card and board in my own copy (or just blacking it out with a marker).

As others have mentioned, the semi-coop element does allow those in last place to hold the game hostage.  However, it is up to the leaders to make sure they don't spend too many of their resources and be prepared to take the brunt of responsibility for crises as they come. Negotiation is key, and it should be house ruled that no one deliberately throw the game unless they have no other choice (or are the Separatist).

RATING: 7
A lot of familiar mechanics, but together in a really neat system.  You've got events that make each round painful on the players, you've got some worker placement, you've got some economics, you've got some resource management, etc.  Lets of stuff, but it all comes together pretty logically.

The high points for me:

- Each player only knows of one possible end game condition, so there is always pressure to get things done since you're never sure when the game might suddenly end!

- The game can end with nobody winning if the archipelago revolts, so there is a small amount of cooperative game here.  If the players don't all work together against the game a little bit, everyone loses.

- A pretty neat economic system, and I generally really enjoy economic games.

Overall, just a really neat game that feels pretty fresh despite using a lot of familiar mechanics.

Also, a side note: I don't know what the people recommending this for two players are smoking.  There is negotiating in this game, and there is also a battle over points for doing various things.  Neither is exciting for two.

The jury's still out on this one. There's a lot going on, and it's fun to build the board. It's easy to be mean and very easy to end the game so that no one wins. I need to play this once or twice more before I decide if I like it or not.

Weight of the worker placement can bog it down- the markets are a BEAR to explain. But the secret objectives make for a tense and exciting game. Being the sympathizer, and subtly trying to secretly send the whole island crashing down, is one of the best (and tensest) experiences I have had in gaming.

Feel I need a few more plays to figure out how I feel about this game. The gameplay is interesting, with clever and varied play required. The scoring is truly odd, and I can't tell if I like it or not. You really do need to pay attention to others' actions to get in on their scoring. The natives aspect feels pretty dumb. Makes absolutely no sense to contribute valuable resources to defeat them. Definitely enjoyed it though. 

Update: Dropping rating from 7 to 4. The game has a lot of interesting things going on, but ultimately fails. The fact that there is no compensation for contributing resources to defeat the natives essentially means you should never do it. So a huge part of the game - the cooperative part - just doesn't work. And that makes the 'traitor' role way too powerful. Way too much luck in what tiles come out, and what you choose, vis a vis the end game scoring conditions. Plus, the rules are just massively convoluted and even after several plays tough to get your head around and remember everything. It's close and it's definitely not boring, but I'm happy to never play this again. Ever. I'll leave it at 4 since my 3 plays were at least interesting.

I like the game. It's very different than anything I have played with the semi cooperative aspect. There is replay value with the different components as well as the markets. Players have lots of choices and hard decisions to make and work together so the rebels don't overrun the track.

The negative would be the semi cooperative gameplay where some players might not be cooperative and might not like it and ruin it for everyone else. So then everyone loses and where is the fun in that, but if everyone likes the game and is willing to play it can be  good.

Good stuff. Take carcasonne, mix in some meeple and resource management, add some markets that kind of work like power grid, give everyone a hidden group objective like Troyes, and sprinkle on some light worker placement.  The end result is an enjoyable and fun game all the way to the end.

RATING: 7
Interesting game.  Not real sure quite what to make of it yet.  Enjoyed my first playthrough while learning rules but I feel rating could go up or down with a couple more plays.  Mainly picked this game up to play with the kids to get them using their brains and for something different than shredding monsters or dropping bombs.  Seems like this could definitely still have some screw you-age though. 

Components are solid as well.  The only problem I have is with part of the insert, which is fantastically designed.  There's a space in the insert for every component in the game.  There's even a removeable tray within the insert that holds the map tiles.  The problem is that this tray isn't wide enough to hold the tiles.  They only drop about a third of the way into the tray.  And they damage corners of tile when pulling them out.  But, at least the tray comes out, still leaving plenty of space in insert for tiles.

Looking forward to playing this a few more times to nail down all the mechanics going on.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Fantastic game.  Extremely competitive.  Lots of player interaction via dialogue rather than direct confrontation on the board (although it can show up via passive aggressive building and resource gathering).  Although possible with 2 players, you really need 3 or more to get a good above the board game going, which is where this game really shines.

The learning curve is huge!  Plan on taking at least an hour to cover all the rules for your first game, and then spend that first game putting around (the game does offer 3 tiers of length by means of end game objectives.  Very cool!).  After your group gets through this initial struggle, however, you will be rewarded with a game that has a huge amount of variety in terms of choices and strategy.

The art is fantastic!  EVERY SINGLE TILE has unique art, and the illustration on the cards is great also.  The components are good for their tasks.  The island tiles though, as stated early, are truly fantastic and make this game a joy to watch unfold on your table.

I would love to give this game a 10, however, the rules are so dense it can take a few times playing through before you're actually playing the game properly.  Complex game design is not something to bring a game down a notch, I know, but the rule book doesn't do a good enough job of easing you into the experience and answering those nit-picky questions.  With that said, this game does so much right!  Economy simulation, meta gaming, great art, real player to player interaction, resource manipulation.  So much good going on here!

RATING: 9
Subversive is definitely the right word for this game.  Archipelago neatly inverts euro-paradigms by loading the game with genre cliches in the form of cruel optical illusions.  New players will grope for the walls and fumble for the corners.  Then, in a panic-induced insight, they will make for the exit, only to slam into a pane of glass.  It's quite the carnival fun-house.  

Weirdly, it's not dissimilar from the kinds of conventional genre deconstruction in Keyflower, only here the process stays in a deconstructive mode well through play.  The game is highly unstable, both in the fragile "balance-beam" manner similar to The Great Zimbabwe and in the sense that the game itself is in a constant state of flux.

Here I'm tempted to bring in games like Pax Porfiriana (and Flux, for that manner) but I think that, mechanically speaking, that there is something very sophisticated going on.  While the game is constantly changing there is far more stability in the player positions.  It's less of a roller coaster and more a torrential downpour where the players get to route the water through that same hall of mirrors.  

All of this says nothing about the negotiations that form the heart of the game.  In the first game with my wife we scarcely traded--merely out of habit.  After we got used to the game we found ourselves cutting deals left-and-right.  It's remarkable how much interesting negotiation this game supports even in a two player setting.

So, in summary.  The game is good.  And, what's more, it's a good game that has ambition to match.  It's been a long time since I encountered a designer a game of such startling scope.  There is something almost Eklund-esque about it, but here Eklund's pedagogical charge has been replaced by an almost sadistic mechanical playfulness.  If the design's craftsmanship can match its ambition the game will hold its rating.  Even if it doesn't, it's failure and fall should prove more interesting than most designs.

I'm giving this an initial rating of an 8 but I could easily see this rating going up to 9 or 10. I really enjoyed the combination of meta-gaming & tactical gaming that was present in this game.

I would say that is MUST be played with the right group. A lot of people will struggle with the concept that everyone can lose so you have to work together but you are actually competing the entire time.

The dynamic of having no idea when the game will end and having to guess at what other victory conditions are out there is a brilliant stroke.

Probably the most unique game I can remember playing.

Archipelago is as hard to pronounce as it is to play. 
With that i mean it is a hard game but yet very fun. 

The game is that you and your friends are playing explorers that finds the new world and semi-cooperative in a very polite way exploit the natives resources and sometime enslave them.
The game never tells you that you do that but you are kinda feeling that you do when you pay a one time payment for a human to work on a pineapple field for 50 years.

In a round it goes like this: 
1. Reset all the meeples
2. Out bid your friends and then blackmail them for play order. 
3. Move meeples and cubes that are a track and see how the doom creeps up on you.
4. Everybody rebels and wont work so they lay down in the mud, this happens the same time you need to handle a crisis or two, and then maybe.. just maybe.. some meeples will stand up and work. 
5. The game becomes a worker placer game. 

Love this game to bits, it's hard and great and awesome and your friend wont like you but you will have the most points but then everybody dies.... 

Must buy

I actually love the semi-coop of this game.  It provides some tension and helps prevent a runaway leader problem.  If you want to stay ahead, you will have to shoulder the burden of resolving the crisis until the rest of the group is back within striking distance of winning.

It takes a certain kind of group to play it, but if you have that group, this thing will shine.

My favorite play of this was one where we chose the short game, but for FIVE HOURS no one hit an end condition. What was cool was after an hour or so the economy really started working like it never had in any game prior, long or short and allowed some really cool stuff to happen. I'd almost like to intentionally set up a game of that length again because it was so much better than any previous play. Besides that play though, this game is good but not great. I don't much care for the random end conditions that can appear out of nowhere.

Update: There are new rules available, which are... better. But ultimately I've given up on the game. Too much frustration about what players "ought" to do, arguing whether they're really valuing a table win (without being the grand winner) over a table loss "as the rules say", etc. And the free-form multi-player negotiation just doesn't work for min-max Euro gamers. It could probably still work for people looking more for a thematic experience.

The artwork in this game is amazing. I love exploration and resource collecting games.  I enjoy the secret objectives well enough, but really haven't played it enough to fully enjoy it.  It is hard to get my wife to play this game, so I end up playing a few solo 2-player games (doesn't get quite the right flavor - but better than nothing).  The only obnoxious part are the crisis cards which pop up after buying the character cards...but I guess that's one of the points of the game. :)

There are just too many things being crammed into this game for it to work, in my opinion. Just getting through the rules took an unreasonably long time.

In particular the aspect of the game that didn't really work for me was the negotiation aspect, where players are choosing to contribute to the common good in order to avoid penalties. This on top of keeping track of two markets, where you can/can't place your workers, and what tiles can be placed where...it was just too much.

Now on the plus side, I will say the art here is well done, and I did really like that you can control for the length of the game. Overall, though - this is not my cup of tea.

Overall nice game. But there are some core mechanics i really hate. Aside game takes a bit long for what it is but bidding for turn has some very annoying mechanic. If you are not the highest bidder you can end up last even thou you bid 2nd most coins. It's because winner chooses order and you can pay him more to make you second in order of play. I really hate it. You can lose lot's of money and still end last and get nothing from that turn. Just not fond of that much punishment in games.

Worker placement/resource management does feature in the game but there is so much more going on as well, so I see this game as a natural progression to try out once you've already got a few worker placement games under your belt.  

Bags of mechanics and depth.  It's kinda got a semi co-op but not really thing going on.  It's a pig to learn but once you've got through the first game you'll be itching to play it again to try out all the things you now realise you could have done.

The designer bills this game as "semi-cooperative."  I'll just bill it as "weird."  It's a eurogame, but its rule have an Ameritrashy inelegance to them that overshadowed my first play.  For example, some units can be "engaged," but can nonetheless reproduce or recruit?

What's most concerning was that I kept asking myself what I should be doing:  What is the export market for?  How do ports/markets work again?  Turn order determination is completely broken, and there's not much benefit to turn order anyway.  

The "semi-cooperative" element is a good-faith attempt to inject some novelty and excitement into an otherwise hardcore euro framework, but I think it falls flat because there's nothing to prevent players from ignoring opportunities to bargain.  Much like Dixit, if others don't play along, the game is missing part of its allure.  

Overall, this game is just unpolished like its spiritual predecessor Civilization: The Board Game.  Too long, too weird, too boring.  In the end, it feels like I'm playing a prototype.  Case in point, there's an egregious misprint in the migration section.  In the first paragraph, OR should be AND/OR.

A few years ago the weight of this game would have thrown me. Now? It's middle weight. But since there is so much to do and remember in the game, how can that be? The THEME! It holds it all together for me. Easy to remember the rules and strategies easily present themselves.

Played this a few times, and while it is fun when you play along with the theme, it suffers when you focus on winning and then reveal to yourself some of the weaknesses of the how the game works. Initiative (the first player) and the domestic and foreign market crisis weigh heavily toward that first player- as do a lot of other aspects of the game. There is a subtle runaway aspect to the game that rewards success so that if you carefully construct your game, you can usually walk away with a win.

For a game this complex, it was a surprising discovery on my part- I usually can't dominate games as well as I can this one. So the challenge for me is a little lost.

However, I like the game and am happy with owning it!

Excellent game!  I'm glad I saw through the "euro-think" happening on the forums and decided to order this one anyway.  My wife and I really enjoy this as a 2 player game, and then as you add more players it just gets better and better.
Updated: Lowered score after two games came grinding to a halt due to limited towns/temples.  The game is great fun, but definitely needs to tighten up it's endgame.

So close...but it ultimately doesn't quite work for me. The tiles are pretty, and I was hoping we finally had found a great exploration and building game, but the rules were overly convoluted and the game was just too long. The coop with a winner deal just didn't work for my group either. Too bad, it looked cool.

Players are Renaissance European powers competing in the exploration of a Pacific or Caribbean archipelago. They will explore territories, harvest resources, use those resources in markets both internal (for their use and that of the natives) and foreign (to sell it in Europe), build markets, harbors, cities and temples, and negotiate among themselves (and maybe betray each other) – all this to complete their secret objectives. They will also need to guess the secret objective of the other players to be able to benefit from them. But players also need to be careful of the natives; if they make them too unhappy or if too many of them are unoccupied, they could revolt and declare independence. Then everyone will lose!

I have dropped my rating (a few times, now) all the way down to 6 (from an initial 9!).

EDIT: We've done a lot of work on a variant for this game (since we do love so much about it). For our groups, this variant brings the game back up to at least an 8: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/933938/a-more-moderate-archipelago-variant

Even though the game is definitely fun and entertaining, the end game conditions and scoring are a huge letdown. Generally, you just barely have time to start to deduce what the secret scoring objectives will be--and then the game abruptly ends because one of the end game conditions was triggered.

You could treat the game as a pure co-op, but the co-op element isn't really very challenging unless the majority of the players are simply ignoring rebellion. We've yet to be in any real danger of the rebels winning.

Lastly, the game is very low-scoring. Most likely, you'll get around 10-15 points total. Especially with 5 players, this means that the game frequently ends in a tie... and the tiebreaker is money. Therefore, whichever player just did a cash-generating action is likely to beat the player who just took a cash-spending action.

We do love playing the game, but the outcome is so uncontrollable and random that it's disappointing.

We are actively trying to come up with some better scoring possibilities (perhaps including scoring for things done during gameplay) and end game conditions (perhaps having several victory conditions like in Civilization The Board Game).

We have played long and short games with both 2 and 5 players. The longest game, with two players, seems to mitigate these problems the best.

A brilliant worker placement with rich theme.  The random generated board looks beautiful each time.  There are many strategies to reaching your randomly given victory condition.  The clear downside is the rulebook, that is slightly, not greatly, disorganised.  A flaw in the game is present in clarifying how 'occupation' of  a building works when it comes to the disengage phase, do meeples still occupy buildings is the common question.  Yes, they do, is the common and not explicitly written answer.

Probably the only game that I like that comes with a massive heap of finicky rules and exceptions to rules.  It has it all: worker placement, resource management, exploration, trade and negotiation, betrayal, cooperation, building, unique powers, bidding, multiple live markets, hidden roles/goals, and a looks absolutely beautiful on the table.  An awesome way to spend an evening with 4 other people.

The heaviest game I've played so far. A little fiddly and slow to get through the turns, but that may just be in contrast to the simple games I've been playing lately. I did enjoy myself, and liked how much was going on on the board. Looking forward to more plays. It IS very long. We played the shortest set of goals, and it still took 3 hours. But that was with all first-time players.

Don't think about it too much or you'll feel bad for exploiting indigenous people and basically being a slaver. Other then that it's a beautiful game.

An ambitious work of board gaming art.  Archipelago is an impressive and unique tapestry of mechanics that somehow manages to both coalesce seamlessly together and perfectly reflect its theme.  It is quite a long list of mechanics: bidding, worker placement, drafting, tableau building, tile placement, hidden roles/objectives, resource production/conversion, trading/negotiation, variable market...  all wrapped together in a semi-coop 3X game.

All of the core "solitaire" gameplay in Archipelago is smooth and compelling on its own.  Exploring new tiles, expanding one's colony across the map, and exploiting those areas for resources is a satisfying puzzle to optimize.  However, those elements are all pretty standard-euro.  It is the interactive elements in Archipelago that set it apart.  The levels of interaction are staggering and direct, from bidding for turn order, to the hidden end-game triggers and scoring, to being able to use everyone else's evolution cards.  The impact of these interactions are intensely magnified by the semi-coop goal of avoiding native unrest and the simple fact that any deal can be made with any resources/promises at any time.  Archipelago may not have the "extermination" required to be categorized as a 4X, but it instead replaces that 4th X with a more mature (and sometimes more brutal) cacophony of interaction.

The weak point of Archipelago is the end-game.  This is also what makes the game somewhat fragile and divisive.  Both the hidden scoring and the existence of a traitor card can be justified as necessary.  Without hidden objectives, it would be easy to determine which player has the lead, and then the semi-coop and trading systems would completely fall apart.  That said, the hidden objectives make the end-game somewhat unsatisfying as the worlds of social-deduction games and euro games collide.

The components and artwork of Archipelago are excellent.  The artwork on the hex tiles is particularly beautiful, adding significant table appeal and enhancing the thematic experience.

RATING: 6
I finally got a game in last week and we had a good time playing it. Here are my thoughts:

Some aspects of the game are clunky. For instance, constructing a ship does not tie up a worker although constructing anything else does. It's a weird exception that's hard to remember. Reproduction does not tie up a worker, Recruitment does not tie up a worker... most other actions do tie up workers. A consistent rule on this would make it easier to teach the rules to new players, and easier to play.

The hidden game end and scoring is interesting, but it can lead to significant variation in the game play length. In our game, none of our hidden cards had game endings that were coming up, so the game took longer than it would have if some of the shorter game options came up. This might be designed to keep people from throwing the co-op side of the game, since there is so much uncertainty about the objective and the when the game will end, but I'm not sure if it works as a solution, since the knife can cut both directions (in other words, the person winning will not know he is winning, and might decide not to save the game only because he thinks he might be losing). In my case, I need consistent playing times so I can let me wife know when I'll be back to take care of my son, so variable playing times of this range is problematic.

The bidding for turn order is a very harsh mechanic. I won the first bid with 5 coins. I bartered to get back 5 coins from other players who wanted to play earlier in the turn order, a resource (I forget what it was), and I still ended up going first that round. The person who bid 4 coins was hurt pretty badly. This mechanics will lead to some huge swings, which would be fine if the person winning had to over compensate giving resources to "the greater good", but it's hard to know who is winning towards the end of the game, which makes it hard to be magnanimous. In this case, it was the first turn, I was clearly winning, so I took on a bigger portion of the burden. But by the end of the game I had no idea who was winning, and was much more reluctant to hand over a win though my magnanimousness. In the end, I was surprised to learn that I won by a very large margin. 

I can't gauge whether the hidden role of the Separatist will fix the problem of players throwing the game if they think they are losing. I am skeptical, though in our game, there was a Separatist, and we did not have a rebellion, so who knows...

There is a lot going on in the game, so it's hard to get a good measure with only one play. The four of us enjoyed the game, but we were all lukewarm about wanting to play again (possible in light of the fact we all want to play A Game of Thrones again, and our time for long games is very limited (several of us have young kids)). I like that the game is experimental. The concepts are cool. The implementation is quite good. But I think there are too many aspects that are a slightly clunky for Archipelago to stick around as a staple. I might be wrong though. It all depends on whether a 10% chance of any given player having the Separatist card and the opacity of whether you are doing well, is enough to counter balance partial co-op aspect of the game. If so, then I think most people will be willing to over-look the other clunky rule exceptions. 

So that's my two cents worth. I look forward to reading more comments from others, and hopefully playing again.

I'm going to give the game the benefit of the doubt and rate it an 8 after just one (all too) short game.

Easier to play than you'd have guessed and with all the randomness in setup and card draws the game will probably not get old quick. Feels like there are many different routes to victory as well.

The only problem I can see is that if someone has a hidden scoring card with the same building as the open scoring card the game will end really fast (as it did in my case).

Update: After an medium length game I can officially say that this is a great game with many different paths to victory. Much like Troyes when it comes to scoring which creates an interesting meta-game.

Wow, this is a hard one to rate.  Part of me wants to really like this, buy it, and explore the gameplay.  But the other side of me finds some serious flaws in this game. Ultimately, there is so much potential in this game, but it barely misses the mark.

It has a nice theme to it.  It presents you with good decisions to make.

But the negatives are: Long game play (we played medium game).  Pointless negotiations.  Too much bickering over a dollar.  Reminded me of Wealth of Nations in that regard.  Difficulty in determining end of game conditions.  There are many and the board gets too cluttered to make the determination easily without giving things away.  An "out of contention" player will likely to try to end the game.  That player was me. I was not successful in ending it because it ended before I could rouse the rebels.  Much to my surprise I almost won the game!  So really it is hard to know how well you are doing.  Given this, what should a player actually be doing to win?

Archipelago is an epic strategy game that has many elements from bedding, player interaction and worker placement. it has lots of opportunities to barter Dagan with your other players. player interaction is amazing in this game.it can go on for a while if you are not careful. The good thing is at the beginning of the game you can choose the length of game you wish to play. Obviously the longer the game the more strategy that is involved and the deeper the immersion will be.

RATING: 5
Players represent colonial powers, exploring an untapped Archipelago (loosely based on the South Pacific), and exploiting it for wealth.

Lavishly produced game, choc full of lovely components.  Players work through a busy sequence of play, taking actions from a large selection of choices, to explore, reproduce, exploit, trade, build, produce, tax, and... you get the idea.  Layered on top is a double market system, where goods are bought and sold domestically as well as internationally.  Layered on top of this (!) is the local population, who want to be employed, happy, and want for nothing, and will lurch into rebellion if players are not careful, ensuring that the game ends with nobody winning. 

Busy game, feels very French, complete with loose rules, and a kitchen sink design philosophy.  On top of everything there are hidden victory conditions, including a traitor type role, who wins if the everyone loses. 

Certainly interesting to play, but by no means one of the greats.  A few too many warts.

Just don't get this one to the table enough. We have had some great memories playing this one with friends. Best played with 4 or 5. Love the secret game ending objects that each person has, so you just don't know when the game will end. I also enjoy the mechanics how your decisions can affect others in the game, so you are playing your own game, but its a bit of a co-op and you still want to win. Again, one you just don't know who won until the end.

Wow.  The game really challenges preconceptions.  I think I am far more fascinated by this than put off by it. This is a really brave design.  The group needs to approach the situation more like you would in real life and less like your typical Eurogame.  If cooperation isn't a main focus, no one will win (except maybe that pesky separatist).

One of my first experiences in modern board-gaming. Interesting idea - competitive worker-placement game, but with an 'everyone loses' condition to prevent an all-out war. Unfortunately, I have too many other games more likely to hit the table than this one.

CLUB COPY. I really do not enjoy the game. It's slow, and there's no sense of tension, you don't feel like your colony is growing, it's lacking in good interaction. Artwork is great but there's nothing revolutionary mechanically. Don't let the game fool you, there's no worker placement in the traditional sense in this game, since you can share action spaces.

UPDATE: Just finished the third Medium length game. Still did not enjoy it. Because you did not know the victory condition there's nothing to plan for, especially for a "Euro"game. If I want exciting uncertainty, I'll play some Ameritrash. I don't want to be confused for two hours, not knowing what to do.

We don't play it often, but everytime we do, I am impressed by how such different mechanics work well together to make a realistic game about colonisation. The pleasure in this game comes more from how you play rather than if you win. Short games are only to play as introduction to the rules, you don't have time to develop. You might want to use home-made rules to counter exploration randomness.

[b][FirstPlayOn10thJan2014][/b] Very much enjoyed this game. I love the interaction in this game, the kind of semi co-ops it offered, the negotiation and trading. The game is pretty to look at especially mid game where you get to see how the islands spread.

I had a couple of problems with my copy. First, the insert that is supposed to hold the tiles didn't work very well. And second, my cubes have incorrect colours, where they do not match the ones in the rulebook and the market/domestic board.

The gameplay is really cool and is actually very easy. I was confused with all the citizen status, what kind of citizen needed for each action, and the sea convoy. After a while, with the help of forums and printed player aids, I pretty much understood. I made a small note to remind myself about it in the game, so that I can refresh quickly before every play.

An amazing and beautiful resource management game with emphasis to exploration of an ocean Archipelago. First we all begin with our ships on one hexagonal ocean tile (or desert tile as a variant). Then as we take turns we are laying more and more hexagonal tiles around, expanding our board, our lands and colonies. Then we employ natives to work on resource extraction, we build churches, markets and cities, we even fight the rebellion and/or other players. This game is so immersive and rich with theme. I love hexes and these are maybe the most beautiful I saw in any game. It has somewhat complex and clunky set of rules and we needed 3 or 4 sessions until we finally figured out all the rules and errors. But the game flows very nicely. Has lots of mechanics, like bidding, worker placement, tile laying and trade. And it's semi cooperative since all players must work together to keep stability and piece in the colonies. All except one possible Separatist, whose goal is to spread chaos and rebellion. We all hate that guy. Altogether one fine game I had to add to my collection.

What can I say?
I do not like semi-cooperative games very much where one player can easily decide that he wants everyone to lose, rather than there being someone who is "better" than oneself. 
The interesting thing in this game is that noone really CAN say who is winning. However, it is very easy to get the feeling that YOU cannot win anymore. And that is where some people will tank the game. Unfortunately. 
Such a beautiful game, but it ultimately fell flat, as ours is a very competitive lot.

Who wants to play a game with hidden point goals? You wouldn't play Carcassonne by telling people after all the tiles were placed, "Oh, so today roads score 4 points and cities are only 1 point. Too bad you were unlucky and layed the wrong tiles." If scoring has to be chaotic, at least do it with a faster playing game.

The wild swingy events added another layer of chaos, taking away any resemblance of a Euro game.

I have played worse long winded games, but this one just got knocked off my wishlist for sure.

RATING: 6
High quality components, new theme, new style "semi-cooperative"

Felt strange to play: why should I make donations so that other players can win the game?! Risk that a player who is behind is fed up with playing and stops it all by pushing the revolts? Why should I spent money for cards that have no use for me personally? 

Could be an average game if one plays it solo. 

Seems to be a mash of good and bad ideas. My main impression: The designer couldn't decide what kind of game he wanted to create. Also the option "everything can be negotiated between the players" seems to be a bad way to fix badly designed aspects of the game.
For a strategy game and even for a tactical game it is to fuzzy and random. For a luck-driven oder story-telling game it is too complex and confusing.

Why tried to create some houserules in order to get a proper game out of it. Difficulty is that each game plays quite different.

Fundamentally flawed rule set.

There is probably a good game to be made with the commponents, but the designer/playtesters obviously is pretty inept. The game is fundamentally flawed to encourage noncooperation but it requires it or everybody loses (except someone might randomly win). So you deal out objective cards, and they will tell you if you have a chance to win againt competent opponents or not (only one of the objectives can win a fair game, otherwise everybody loses). 

The board compentents are very nice. Most of the game is very interesting and I would really like this game if the rules were not so horrible. It's a shame such a good game was so completly ruined by poor design on one element.

To be fair I think everybody playing this game is already a loser.

Too much luck at the beginning that could lead to a serious disadvantage. Most of the cards are useless. Great trading and unrest system.

I love this game in theory and I love just about everything about it... Interesting economics, exploration, worker placement... But in my play group it has one fatal flaw.  The game forces players to cooperate when a crisis hits.  Failure to address the crisis carries a huge penalty and can bring about a shared loss for everyone if not addressed.  If you have a sore sport, or someone who likes to sabotage others, is bad at negotiating, would rather everyone suffer unless they get an advantage, or would rather see the game end in loss than you win, the game becomes incredibly not fun because there's is nothing to penalize them or stop them from doing so, in fact their is an end game objective that could encourage them to do this.

What a mess of a game. It's a bunch of ideas thrown together but feels like nobody playtested it. When we played, nobody was motivated to bid on turn order; it didn't seem to make any difference. Why throw away your money if having the second highest bid doesn't guarantee you second choice of turn order? 

Nobody had motivation to buy evolution cards; with rare exception, they didn't seem to benefit single players, so we spent the whole game just rotating them. Boring. The few evolution cards that were helpful were so expensive as to be undesirable.  

Nobody had reason to use the foreign market.  Other than my own private win condition, I had no other goals, and so had no idea what I was supposed to be doing.  How can you plan for  3 to 4 other hidden scoring conditions?  My game-ending condition was to exhaust the discovery icons, which would have taken 4 to 5 hours to achieve.  One of the scoring conditions was boats, but I had no wood to build boats or other buildings in any of my tiles for half the game.

If you know you're doing worse than others, you are motivated to start a revolution in order to end the game and make everybody lose.

Most games click after you've played for a while. Archipelago never clicked.

After one play, I like Archipelago a lot. I've a feeling this game may grow on me as I enjoy the hidden information aspects and the diverse use of Eurogame mechanisms.

A provisional score of 7, after one play.

This one will see a lot more play in 2013.

Score upgraded to an 8 (March 2013). Archipelago is growing on me as I experiment with the solitaire game and I'm very keen to try it again with 3 or more players. There are some very intriguing elements to the game - market management to mitigate against crises; the pressure to explore to generate Explorer Tokens / resources and the labour market consequences of exploration; ensuring access to and use of Evolution Cards; and, the interplay of port and market infrastructure when trying to maximising the benefit of commodity transactions.

There are diverse routes to victory, impacted necessarily by the emerging geography and position within that geography of a given player's citizens and infrastructure. 

The negotiation and hidden information elements add additional spice.

RATING: 3
Let me preface this by saying I think there is a good 90 minute game to be had somewhere within the game of Archipelago.  That game is *not* what it currently is though.

The game plays like the unnecessary parts were never edited.  The game has too many things going on, and has no elegance to it.  There is a mediocre market, with mediocre worker placement, mediocre resource management, and mediocre event phases.  Further, the scoring is downright bad.  Having a single open goal provides direction, but the point variation is too high with the hidden roles.  Points are very low, so end score is very swingy, as people are or are not completing objectives.

It was not a *bad* experience, but it offers absolutely nothing that some other game would not offer, and in a much shorter time span.  Not to mention, its pretty horrific theme.

I was not impressed by this game.  I think it's trying to be more of a simulation than a game, but there was just too much going on for me.  It took too long and when it finally ended, it was due to a slave revolt and we all lost.  I didn't care for the hidden scoring objectives and I didn't care for the semi-cooperative aspect.  Not a rewarding experience.

The struggle to explore and populate a "new world" is expertly realized throughout the design and production of this gem of a game. Highlights include beautifully illustrated world exploration, dynamic game balance dependent on player participation in a semi-cooperative environment, and opportunistic exploitation through a clever use of evolution cards, negotiation, and area control.

12/10/2012 - An interesting worker-placement and exploration game with a few interesting twists:
- As you explore you discover natives that would like to work. However, if there is not enough work then they become restless and can revolt - at which point everybody loses. 
- Each player gets a card that explains what will give bonus VPs for all players and an end-of-game condition that any player can trigger.
- you can score VPs by benefiting the hole colony. 
- the economic elements can work against you having too efficient an economic engine puts too many products in the markets which makes the natives restless. 

We played a 5-player short game so probably didn't explore the mechanic as much as we could - but it definitely needs a revisit.

Very slow to get going as you have so many things you need to do initially and no workers with which to do it however after a couple of turns you are desperately trying to balance the unemployment (grey meeple) against the actions you have to take and the rebellion track (black meeple)rockets ever upward.  Rebellion is a really nice mechanic as it must be considered in EVERY action you undertake.
To 'control' rebellion you need to build a church but to build a church you need gold which requires taxing the population which increases rebellion.

Initially the events where you were required to spend goods to stand people up didn't really seem like a mechanic that had much of an effect and then suddenly one came up that we couldn't satisfy and boom rebellion overtook us and we all lost.

Really enjoyed this game and want to play it again soon, however it requires a massive table (we had to go to a local wargame store to use a wargaming table) and so I think its unlikely to hit the table all that often.
 
Really beautiful components and nice idea on the game insert, however it doesn't fit!

Wow. What a story arc ! Impressive !

I enjoy this blend of resource management, guessing, semi-cooperation and overall, the tools given to players to shap the game at their will.

What i like into this game is the way the theme is driven by the mechanisms :

- exploration : it is a fog somewhere and you will have to adapt yourself if the resources doesn't meet your plans. Will you discover island or land ? This will drive your development (boats/fish and possible hard development vs more resources/buildings and easier development ?)

- population management : exploration -> new territories -> more people in the archipelago : recruitment, rebellion, taxation, birth ?

- crisis management : find a balance between overproduction/under production, needs of local people/homeland and rebellion.

Along with Antiquity, this is one of the first game that makes me feel the exploration time. Way more than Endeavor or Navegador that feel very dry to me.

This is certainely the epic exploration game i was looking for.

I so want to like this game, and I'm going to give it at least a couple more tries before passing judgement, but my first play was one of the biggest disappointments I've ever had in a game.  As a co-op game, it appears to be a very easy one - we were never anywhere near having the natives revolt in our first game, and what's more, there were never any rebellious workers either.  The most frustrating thing for me was the fact that while technically there's a lot that can be done on each turn, very little of it really seems to matter that much or be related to actually getting points.  There is a lot going on: exploration, market manipulation, acquisition of special powers through character/idea/technology cards, resource management, but I was surprised by how opaque the strategy was (I never say that about games) and how much of what the system allows for can end up being irrelevant.  The artwork is absolutely stunning though!  I'll update my comments when I've played it more.

RATING: 7
Nagyon sokáig állt a polcon a relatíve összetett szabálya, és a nagy játékidő miatt. Végre sikerült kipróbálni egy négyszemélyes játék keretei között. A rövid játékot próbáltuk a két kritikus cél nélkül, ám ebből rögtön kettőt is lenyomtunk. Nagyon ambivalens érzéseim voltak. Az egyedi mechanizmusok nagyon érdekesek, és a tematika, a hangulat nagyon magávalragadó.  Ennyire talán még sose éltem bele magam társasba felnőtt fejjel. Erre rásegít a semi-coop jelleg, ahol mindenkinek figyelembe kell venni a saját és köz hasznát egyaránt. Node ezzel el is értünk a problémámhoz. Egyrészt nagyon-nagyon meg kell válogatni, hogy kivel ül le az ember. A játékosoknak fel kell fognia, hogy a kollektív vereség nem jobb, mint a közös győzelem esetleg egy másik játékos abszolút győzelmével. Szóval ha valaki úgy ül neki, hogy inkább bedönti az egészet, ha ő nem nyerhet, akkor nem lesz élvezetes a játék. De megfelelő emberekkel nagyon izgi az, hogy úgy próbálom meg megmenteni/megmentettni a világunkat, hogy közben tyúklpésésekben azért haladjak a saját győzelmem felé is. Mi ebben a két játékban nagyon borotvaélen táncoltunk végig, így szinte egyáltalán nem jött ki a kompetitív jelleg, mert végig közdüttönk az életbemaradásért. Viszont utólag kiderült, hogy egy szabályt nem jól játsztottunk (az első körben nincs krízis), és ez lehet, hogy sokat könnyít majd a további játékokon. Bár szerintem még így is alakulhat úgy egy-egy játék a szerencételen krízisek miatt, hogy háttérbe kell szorítni a versengést.

Nagyon vágyom egy következő játékra a jó szabályokkal. Illetve mindenkinek ajánlom a játékot, akinek fontosabb, hogy a játék minden percét élvezze, és bele tudja magát élni a dologba, mintsem, hogy a végén egyedüli győztesként állhasson fel. Pszichológiai kísrlétnek se utolsó a játék. :)

Egyelőre 7 az értékelésem, de a helyes szabályokkal ez simán felugorhat 10-re egyből. :)

u.i.:
Az angol szabályfordítás sajna nem lett tökéletes (az eredeti francia), így faq-uk, player aidek bújása kötelező az első játék előtt, főleg enganged worker ügyben.

Archipelago combines a couple of elements that I don't like much so it's not particularly surprising that the game doesn't do it for me.

I'm actually beginning to think that semi-cooperative games cannot actually work, ever. (Of course, my definition of "works" might be rather different from yours here.) And while the traitor (or separatist as he's called here, true to the game's theme) does stir things up a bit he is making matters even worse. It is in every player's interest to keep the system on the brink of collapse because that means you'll have to pay less and can follow your own agenda as much as possible, and it's not difficult to see how a traitor would have little trouble exploiting this situation. Additionally, what's the point of being extortionist when the other guy can just say "screw you" and make everybody lose? And what about players who'd rather do that same thing rather than coming in third place or whatever?

Now add on top of this that you may have played a couple of hours when that happens, and that negotiation games aren't anywhere near my favourites to begin with and the few little touches that I do like here are drowned out by issues with the general game structure.

Random Thoughts:

This euro provides a good sense of a broad theme, but there are too many elements that feel removed from the theme resulting in a feeling that is not significantly more thematic than a "German" euro.  

The art and design gives 80s/90s adventure vibes, but is often not user friendly so I have to err on a lower score as a result.  For example, tile laying is rewarding and beautiful, but there is too much clutter on each tile so that the important information doesn't stand out as much.

Because of phase order, it is difficult to prepare for the archipelago balance events in advance leading to greater chaos (you may or may not like this).  Player behavior in board games typically adds to chaos and unpredictability already so I am not sure this was the best choice.  Also because of this phase order, these crises just happen, but there is no real reason or explanation, further hampered by the inability to anticipate.  As a result, there is not a sense that the play experience was as rich of a story as it could have been.   

There are many other mechanics that are not explained thematically or are just too dry.  In other words, actions often feel more mechanically-driven than theme-driven.  As someone who enjoys emergent narratives, I would prefer stronger thematic elements or a cleaner Euro.  If I have to deal with cognitive mess, there should be pungent thematic motivation.

Despite these flaws, there are still enough unique elements to keep me thinking about it and help it stand out among the crowd. I enjoy seeing the semi-cooperative element, the ability to select different objectives for shorter games, the diversity of secret objectives, and the openness of negotiation/bartering.  As a result,  the game does seem very gamer group dependent.  Even More plays will help me understand these aspects better.  Sweetspot is 3/4 players possibly.

RATING: 8.9
Lots of great exploration, expansion, collection, and secret information. The secret objectives mean that no two games feel the same, because you have different goals every time. And it's tough to guess at your opponent's goals (although certainly doable) because all resources are valuable for various reasons in every game. Maybe he's collecting cows for points on his objective card... Or maybe he's trying to collect them to force his end-game condition. Or maybe he just wants to sell them on the market later for money. Or maybe he's trying to cover all of our bases before the next crisis...

The game length given for each set of cards is pretty accurate, so you can have short or long games. The game has some clunky mechanics but is still extremely fun to play.


The pieces are extraordinarily good looking and of good construction. The storage solution given in the box is horrible though. The plastic cracked almost immediately, which meant meeples slowly went missing until we figured it out. And the various components go everywhere in the box even when simply turning it sideways, much less transporting it.

I'm not sure about it. The game contains some interesting ideas. I had the problem that I had the feelin that I had to make too much meaningful decisions without having a good idea about the consequences.
What this game is really missing is some kind of first-play setup. 
We played it again with some houserules and it was much better - not nescessary because te changed rules make a better game but because it makes it easier to grasp for beginners. I think I would be willing to play it again and after some games even try it again without any houserules...

I had fun, but it seems far too complicated and long for its own good.  Or maybe the rules just weren't clear enough.  I'd play it again, but it's not something I'd request.  Turn order is based on blind bidding where everyone loses their bid... perhaps my least favorite game mechanic.

Hidden goals that count for all players ruin this one.

I found it a little ridiculous that you could get a bunch of points at the end of the game from a random goal you never knew about.

It feels like there are a lot of interesting moving parts to the game but that a lot of them don't matter too much because of where you're getting your points, which is disappointing.

RATING: 3
Possibly too complex for its own bluffing space. Everything has multiple uses, which makes it incredibly difficult to identify what other players' goals are in order to compete and those resources are so component limited that identification of important resources often results in there being a simple choking of the important resources.
Nothing happens in medium and short length games, but long games match their title crushingly well.

More plays are necessary.

Only played once and the short version. And just as it was about to take off after 1h of rules explanations and 1.5h of gaming it ended. 

Here are my impressions and grade after that expericence.

- Hidden ending conditions are a terrible idea. Just terrible. You plan for doing something and suddenly the game ends. After playing it a bunch of times you might know all possible ending conditions but still. Horrible idea. 

- Feels old in many ways. It is much harder to explain then it should be. It is not streamlined or balances. It is just not very user friendly to new players. 

- Love the theme and exploring a modular board with huge hexes. Love that. 

- Love producing all you can of one resource with an action. Trying to get as much return as possible. 

- Like trading on two markets selling and buying goods. But you may with one action only trade one of a resource. And actions are very limited. You may buy building that lets you trade two resorces once per round for no actions. That is a must buy building to make money. It costs 2 to build and 1 to power so if you do not have the money you must spend an action to just get some money. 

- It is a semi-coop with all bad things that comes with it. Luckely it was very easy to beat the game so it did not matter in our game. Unlucky that my secret objective (you only get one not a choice at all) was to make us loose to the game. A thing that was totally impossible in our game. 

If I play it a few more times it will get better, but it will never get to be as good as my top ten favourite games to play instead in this situation...so that will never happen.

RATING: 6
I think this game is quite underrated. Its components and art design are exceptional. I feel excited about exploring this Caribbean world each game. The game is rich and has a lot of different mechanics built in (worker placement, exploration, trade, semi-coop, resource gathering, bluffing, war, race..). I like the fact that each player only knows some of the end game and victory conditions, forcing everyone to look at what the others are doing. Resources are scarce, so the race to gather them is fierce.
on the downside, I feel the game could have been more interactive and the semi-cooperative aspect feels under-used. Nowhere near Dead of Winter. Also. I like the fact the game is somewhat deterministic (no dice rolling) - only exploration is uncertain which is quite thematic. I am missing a good handful of dice though..
The small number of resources pushes the group to act fast, and focus their effort, preventing never-ending escalation of building one type of building or collecting one type of resources for instance. It is so pleasant to navigate on this map that the fact the game forces you to focus on your objectives can feel a bit frustrating at times. Also the cost of the wonders is so prohibitive that it makes little sense to build those unless seriously undermining your chances to catch up on the others..
Buildings are not that useful and all sorts of investments are quite poor. Especially having a second building of a certain type (a second market for instance). So, if you see someone building a second one, clearly, it is a victory or end game condition.. There is no tech tree for instance. But then the game stops at 5 of one type, making that race very repetitive and quite boring.. It would have been much better with 2, or different numbers on each card so it is unexpected.. keeping the game tense.. And the difference between short and long games is only the number of times you have to build the same building to finish the game, making long games completely boring.
Also, I thought that the card drafting mechanics were off-putting - you want to be able to interact with the gorgeous board as much as possible, not fiddle with cards..

It's heavy, busy & fiddly, and a bit  difficult to teach, but once learned, it's a very unique experience &  pretty intuitive once a few rounds have taken place, though it gets a bit boring since it tends to drag. The forced collaboration is the weakest point of this game- the experience can be ruined if the weakest player tanks the game for everyone, and I know, defenders of the game say there are remedies to this, but I say bullshit.  Also, this game would be so much more thematic if combat were somehow integrated. Archipelago deals with colonial powers that were always at odds with one another, historically, thus powers/players should be more concerned about one another than so much focus placed on the natives rising in revolt. But it is a Euro, so no fighting, anyone.

This one has my two favorite mechanisms, negotiation and exploration. Our game ended quickly so I didn't get a chance to really explore the game much. I think this could eventually make it up to a 7+ for me. The down side is that it is essentially a logistics game and you need to learn which actions to take in which order to maximize your efficiency. That isn't part of a game I particularly enjoy but it can be fun once mastered and you know how all elements of the game interact.

I like the unknown vp conditions, it prevents engine building and forces players to maximize points quickly instead of focus on creating a powerful engine an pumping out money or vp or whatever by the end. I also like the semi-coop, sacrifice this or risk everyone losing the game aspect. I think house ruling some elements like the explore tiles and possibly the card stack may enhance the players' ability to make strategic decisions but could stall the game.

Overall a fun euroized exploration/economy game that I would like to play again to get a better feel for. I think we just scratched the possibilities for negotiation on this one.

Well played it a second time and again the game ended after two turns, this time with no one winning. The good is the exploration and the card turning/buying mechanic. I still don't have a solid opinion on this one so I'd give it another shot.

The game is a mess. Lots of different mechanisms that barely work on their own, and definitely don't work together. Though the turn order bidding doesn't even work on its own- that part as written is truly horrendous.

I really wanted to like this game, but I don't think it works. It's far too easy to tank the game, even if you're not the separatist it's still too good to be greedy in this game. I think the euro mechanics that drive the game are boring and has way too many exceptions and rules when you're already focusing on trying to read people. I like the hidden end game and scoring, I like the art and production values and it has a lot of great ideas that just don't come together. The economy is swingy, progress is too slow, you get too few actions each round to get to make interesting decisions.

I also think the theme is problematic. I of course knew about it going in, but it felt a lot worse once we started playing.

First play: The buying/resolving card aspect of the game, especially the punishment, gummed up the game enough to the point that I didn't care if I tanked the game. Even if someone was the native sympathizer, it wouldn't matter as it is so easy to tank the game. I'd like to play a variant that has the game less focused on paying for those punishments.

First try, intro game, 2p... not enough info to formulate an opinion.  Probably messed a few things up to cause a revolution at the beginning of Round 2?  :P

UPDATE:  Finally got around to playing this again.  I've watched so many playthroughs in an attempt to learn how to teach this game so I don't overwhelm my wife.  Basically we played the short scenario, "No Secrets Between Friends", completely open handed.  It served as a very gentle introduction to the main mechanical system of the game and the flow between phases.  Now that we understand how to play, we'll add the secret game-end conditions to add that stressor and make our actions more strategic.

UPDATE: 4th Play, 2p.  Loving this game.  Feels like Carcassonne or Glen More on steroids.  LOVE exploring the islands and building up an economy.  We've been playing the medium-length scenario. Can't wait to try this 4p.

UPDATE: First 4p game.  Amazing!  I used my teaching script (in the files section) and it was a resounding success.  2 non-gamers and 1 gamer learned the game by the second round and picked up on every nuance we encountered along the way.  Fantastic game.  Took 4 hours though :P (with the medium-length game)

Personal: is a worker placement, expand yourself, manage your workers while try to cooperate with your opponents. The secret goals are good, not unbalanced and easy to guess them. You need a group to play it, for the coop part, as you need negotiation and some treachery, but you vcan play also without that

RATING: 7
Interesting game, but wow, what a terrible way to end with the surprise private ending conditions--feels like the designer struggled to find a suitable game clock, and while the idea of partial information here is interesting, they are a terrible pairing with the Euro side of the game. Overall it gives the feeling of a design from the late oughts, whereas the design community have since created better ways to realize these design goals.

Other mechanics seemed interesting, but probably excessive hidden information with the assumption that it is required to support better player interaction. I'm not so sure, and many mechanics would have played out effectively the same with open information. While I was generally OK with it, one of the players in my group really disliked it.

Overall, there is some interesting stuff here, but I don't think the game deserves the rating it currently has (7.4 as of 9/2016).

Beautiful game with almost no luck involved. A obligatory game for every serious game weekend.

One negative thing: it's sometimes hard to end the game as players may work against others objectives. It results in many games not ending properly, "ok, one more round, then we settle the score".

This is everything I hate in a euro and more.

the rules are extremely long
the game is overly complex by a factor of about X4
it has blind bidding where everyone loses their bids
it can end suddenly without warning

and on top of all that, the ending is very random as everyone has hidden cards and you scored based not only on your card but theirs as well, so you don't even know what you are trying to score against for the most part while you are playing.

Awful game, would not want to play again other than at gunpoint. 

This is what would happen if Dr. Frankenstein fused Caylus and Fluxx into one game and it ran around chasing villagers until they burned it to death with their torches.

Complex: yes / Depth: nope
The hidden goals make it too random if at the end of the game you will get a lot of victory points or not because you built havens instead of churches. Our first game ended with a rebellion as there were two crisis right one after another where iron was needed and no player had iron. Three joker tiles were spent during the first crisis and so was no resource left for the second crisis. Oh yes, that was fun (irony), no really that felt strange. Furthermore no one of us players did ever bid a single coin for turn order. The only thing that I found interesting was that the group as a whole was responsible for keeping the rebellion down. Otherwise there was no innovative mechanic. Rather a disappointment but must check with a second play if first impression will last. I even consider downrating it.

Like Earth Reborn, from the same designer: a really smart, wonky game almost no one wants to play. Teaching it is a bear, remembering it is just as bad, and one gets the impression throughout that there's a wholly artificial system at play, like trying to sleep on a sheet of cardboard painted expertly to look like a pillow.

As for the artwork and setting... At first, I thought it was a cheeky dig at games like Puerto Rico or Five Tribes, which mindlessly incorporate indentured laborers as part of the "abstraction" of game design. I was delighted at the prospect of a game in which your own workers can revolt against you! But statements on the site by the designer (In paraphrase: It's okay for me to be racist, I have a black girlfriend) lead me to believe maybe the designer has not wrapped his head fully around the issues this game evokes. And the arguments around this game on BGG tend to just descend into "racism exists/there's no such thing" idiocy. So, tetchy at best.

Good medium-heavy Eurogamer with a really good presentation. Everything looks great, even the insert is designed to be used during play, coming apart to serve as tile holder for the island pieces. Design-wise there's nothing new.
I don't like the "worker placement" board has spaces where unlimited players can be. One of the defining characteristics of the mechanism is to block other players, and worry about them blocking you. It removes a lot of the tension.

Good game.

Has lots of replayability. The two markets are a really nice feature.

The game has also room for a few expansions like extra island tiles, more cards, and maybe one or two extra players.

Down side is that no matter how many players you play, the card events that happens each time to draw one is the same. It is not scaled according to the number of players. This makes 2 players game super easy and max number of player super hard. :/ Fix this please, it's really bad. 

I think I will eventually buy this one. It is climbing in my list of to buy things... but I wont pay near a hundred dollars for it though. I think I'll try to get it at half price, used. No game is worth 100$.

RATING: 9
Some of the most notable features of this game include the semi-cooperative play, and the tension caused by the hidden roles mechanic which may include a rebel sympathizer.

All I can add is that even if you take away all of those things, this game is a still a blast to interact with.  THe components look awesome and the mechanics of the game interact with each other in really interesting ways.  This is a game that I don't mind losing because I'll have had fun building up my corner of the board.

Don't be intimidated by the rules, this game is worth the trouble!

This is a meaty game with great production value and an interesting theme. There is a lot to consider it has some great mechanics that combine spatial expansion, resource generation and worker placement with the economic element of buying/selling goods for profit and for the common good. The hidden end-game triggers and victory point awards are an interesting idea, but it can get a bit frustrating sometimes.

However, the semi-cooperative nature of this game just doesn't appeal to me. I do not buy the whole "primary goal is to prevent the rebellion" since the player with the most victory points is the grand winner. When there is a grand winner and all the rest are just winners, to me it sounds like one player won and the other have lost. Which brings me to the next point, which is related to the rebellion. The danger of the natives rebelling and everyone losing the game is ever-present and requires effort from all players to keep it at bay. So, once a player realises that there is not way for him/her to win the game, there is a great incentive to help bring about the rebellion and have everyone lose the game. Maybe it depends on your point of view, some people will be quite happy to play to their full ability, even if there is no whay for them to win. If you are in a competitive group however, I guess having someone causing the rebellion because there is no way they can win, will be something that will be occuring quite frequently.

Played twice with all new players, and it was really bad. I have played four turns of this game, in three hours, across two games. You are making games for humans, and that demands that you make the first trips through less inhumanly punishing and impenetrable. Under that, I am aware there is a very gamable game though. It just lacks first level heuristics.

RATING: 8
Nice components, some interesting mechanics, but plagued with fiddliness. It's too easy to forget to do something which can influence the game immensely. 

After a few plays, I have to say: it's growing on me. Once we understood the balance of the archipelago, it finally dawned on me that the actual game is not about trading goods for money or vice versa, it's about the interaction between the players. Working together - or not - for the benefit of yourself and/or the archipelago is what makes this game good!

RATING: 7.5
Wonderfully produced eurogame where you are forced to balance cooperative needs (i.e. preventing a rebellion) and personal needs (meeting your own victory objectives) making for very interesting / tense gameplay.

The problem with this game is that it has a good number of things that make it great if you and your group play the way it was meant to be played by the designer.  Take for instance the supplies end of game condition; it can happen so quickly that it can make the secret end of game conditions useless.
The secret objectives are also of wildly different value: knowing that any kind of good is worth points is more valuable that knowing, say, that the ports will give you points, because in the latter case owning more ports than the others is  an extremely difficult, quite random, proposition.
It seems to me that the game was playtested by like-minded players only. 

The game looks good, the game does many things quite simply and logically, but in the end can be very frustrating, because the secret winning conditions do not work (even though I love the idea), and because the turn order bidding breaks the game, and also because the semi-coop part does not work that much.
Too bad.

It gets a 1 as per the rating recommendations - the game is broken, although if I had to rate it against other games that would be a 4.

Gleichzeitig müsst ihr zusammen darauf achten, dass die einheimische Bevölkerung nicht zu unglücklich wird und revoltiert, denn dann haben alle Spieler verloren, außer einer ist ein Sympatisant.

RATING: 7
(03/30/13) A very intriguing, open-ended, semi-cooperative, worker-placement game, blending a number of game mechanisms from many other classic games.

1) Exploration is reminiscent of Entdecker: New Horizons and/or Tikal. There is a stack of region hexes from which to draw from, with very strict placement rules. This results in a dynamic, unique, and colorful map board that unfolds beautifully.
2) Interesting and thought-provoking economics that is separated and decoupled into domestic and export markets, each with differing supply-demand values. (A comment was made that this market system would have made Supremacy a much better game.)
3) Reproduction reminiscent of the "Love Shack" mechanism in Stone Age. Two meeples in the same region can reproduce an offspring.
4) Evolution cards, which can be bought by the players, are reminiscent of building cards in Le Havre. Depending on the card, other players can "visit" and activate the card, paying a visit fee to the owning player.
5) Resource production similar to a number of other Euro-games. Meeples can "park" themselves onto resource icons on each region hex, with a harvest action. The twist is that all the player's meeples scattered throughout the archipelago can harvest one type of resource, if desired.
6) Four kinds of buildings can be bought per a resource schedule, similar to Settlers of Catan. Each can serve a different function.
7) The game is semi-cooperative, in that if the rebels exceed the civilian population, everybody loses, unless there is a player with a separatist secret objective card. This is similar to the "traitor" mechanic in Shadows Over Camelot or the "Cylon" in Battlestar Galactica: The Boardgame.
8) Crisis cards force players to cooperatively allocate resources to prevent ill-effects from taking effect. This is similar to "The Watch" mechanism in A Game of Thrones; everybody needs to contribute resources to help keep the Wilderings at bay.
9) Everything is negotiable, similar to Traders of Genoa. This can be rather uncomfortable for players who don't enjoy negotiation games, but the relative values of specific items is moderately discernible.

While there are probably several other "familiar" Euro-game mechanisms, the overall effect is an immersive game play, where all players must help maintain balance on the archipelago, lest chaos and rebellion are unleashed, resulting in the game "killing everyone". There is also a semi-civilization building aspect, because of the thematic exploration mechanic, exploitation of resources from the region hexes, and expansion in terms of buildings.

What makes the game unique is that each player has a secret objective card with two elements: top side indicates a secret game-ending condition, and a bottom side that indicates the victory point schedule for having the most of some element in the game, be it civilians, resources, money, etc. The game-end can be triggered by any one of the players' objective cards. However, all of the victory point schedules are considered and added up to determine the winner. The problem is that each player is only aware of their own victory point schedule. This makes for an interesting game of competing self-interests. Players must work together to ensure the game doesn't end in rebellion, while at the same time, doing whatever they can to promote their own self-interest, which is always at conflict with the overall well-being of the archipelago.

The rules are well-written, but dense in the typical Euro paragraph fashion. It took an hour to read through the rules together as a group. Ironically, the play itself is quite simple and straightforward. The components are top-notch, with cardboard punching out cleanly and quickly, and plenty of wooden components as well. The artwork, especially the map board, is simply gorgeous, but with wooden meeples and ships, unfortunately screams Settlers and Seafarers of Catan.

The initial play was rather clunky and unintuitive, but sped up after several turns. Clearly, many more plays are needed to fully understand the design and formulate a long-term strategy. The game was so open-ended in the different types of actions available, that players initially suffered mild analysis paralysis. However, most players were willing to see past the rough edges, and see this is a brilliant design, a diamond in the rough, so to speak. Patience and many plays look like they will amply reward players with successive plays. Initial rating is a "7", with room to go up.

Right now this is the game I most want to play, but rarely get to. The amount of the game that's negotiable is excellent; I haven't played it enough with the same people to get to the point where we can actively deduce each other's victory conditions.

Re: racism -- as part of teaching this game, you have to tell people how the game ends if the black man ever overtakes the white man. Even though the game's not terribly bigoted, I really think they should have thought this one through a little more.

Only played it once, and although I can say I did enjoy it, it did disappoint me a bit. Perhaps I was anticipating more of an active market economy in the game and found it was used mainly in crisis.

I love the idea of what you do within the game, as well as the tension between workers, population, and rebels, and yet the game fell a little flat.

[Confession: It was quite late when we learned and played this game and that could be an influencing factor. I am absolutely happy to try it again (I did enjoy it to a degree), and who knows, my rating could improve.]

After one play: (2p long) Can't decide how I feel about the rules ambiguity.  Also the game didn't seem particularly 'tight' to me but that might have been because I didn't have a well thought out strategy on my first play (& couldn't see how my actions would directly or even indirectly impact my victory points) so I didn't get that feeling of choosing between limited, critical actions that I love.

After 2nd play: (2p medium) This was much better.  I thought I'd won easily but the hidden victory condition of my opponent meant I lost by one point.  I like games that I don't win.  The rules went a lot smoother this time after I spent half a day clarifying things.  It still didn't feel as tight as the games I love but that was OK (I'm used to being one dollar short or needing one action more, thanks to Martin Wallace...)

3rd play was 3p medium.

7th play was 5 player (2 new) long game.  Worked pretty well but I'd probably go medium next time with 5.

RATING: 6
A free form exploration and resource gathering game with some Ameritrash influences in the negotiations and crisis avoidance. There are perhaps too many crises for the players to deal with and they consume so many precious resource cubes, that the 2 hour playing time quoted becomes wildly optimistic. Scoring is tight and objectives mostly hidden, so you can do right or wrong things entirely by accident. In my one play the native revolt ended the game early, but that seemed a bit of a relief.

The PvE threat (ie. the rebels) is basically non-existent. The only time the rebel level even gets close to the population cap is when we think someone's the Pacifist.

Still, maybe we're doing something wrong -- the rulebook is frankly rather confusing. Still an enjoyable game and a nice break from the more directly confrontational stuff we play most often, and we always have fun playing it, but, yeah, the game itself needs to threaten the players a lot more than it does.

Tied with Earth Reborn as my favorite game--well done, Christophe Boelinger!
Archipelago takes a smart worker-placement ruleset and through some concoction of modular elements creates something that goes beyond the tired "build the best victory point engine possible" gameplay of so many European-style designs. The best thing Archipelago does is vary the victory objectives you have to score with your economic engine (and negotiation skills...), making each play require new strategies. So wonderful.

A mess of a game, the worker placement board is a mess. The rules are a mess, and generally not a lot of fun to play for a while and then lose on a random event because people just happened not to have stockpiled resource X. Also, the huts on the map mechanism is just tedious to track. So fiddly and for what? 

Semi-co-op games need more incentive for you to pay the shared costs other than "pay or lose". I had stockpiled certain tokens for my VP card, a random event dictated that i needed to spend all my stocked VPs or we would lose the game. 

Also, completely tone deaf on colonialism.

It's a week later and I've nearly forgotten this one entirely.  Way too much rides on what hex you choose, which you only get to see 1 face of before committing to discard it and select the one underneath. Many are hard to place anywhere useful. Then a lot of the scoring is hidden, and this conceals both points and the end game conditions.  I think this one is really just a miss.  A pity, since it's very well produced.  Granted, only one play, but I will not seek this out again.

Débuter à joué en solo.  Au début j'étais assez mélangé avec les crises et te savoir tout le temps attente de demande mais après 3 partie on commence à prendre le tour de se préparer aux crises.  Il y a toujours une tension mais je l'aime mieux que celle de ghost stories qui revient tout le temps à avoir des fantômes sur le terrain qui apparaîssent.  Je voulais rejouer à Agricola en solo mais Archipelago c'est plus varié.  Beaucoup de ressources je trouve les règles ok.  On garde la balance. En solo je ne pense pas me forcer à atteindre la médaille d'or un moment donné si on est bon à bronze ou argent c'est ok pour moi.  En groupe il doit pas mal avoir de discussion autour de la table pour l'équilibre de l'archipel et la crise.  Je pense que ce sera encore plus intéressant.

Unabashedly colonial theme, the game teaches that exploiting foreign lands and populations is okay, and that to appease the rightfully angry indigenous population, you just have to force your religion on them, or feed them with their own produce. Apart from the irresponsible handling of the theme: some mechanics are overly complicated (e.g. turn order) or have a highly random outcome (exploration). Drawing new cards introduces another element of luck in this game, which can sometimes decide the fate of the game. For a game of this length, too much randomness for my taste, and too convoluted rules.

Artificial and TOTALLY mechanical.  Ugh...

Boring too (I was seriously bored after 1h of my first play already).

--

The separatist is problematic.  On top of that - losing player(s) can REALLY crash the game causing the defeat of all participants (or the win of the separatist).  What's even worse, a loss can also be provoked by player(s) who would become loser(s) BY paying the resources required to avoid a shared defeat.

-Bidding and worker placement mechanics generally lack tension

CB - Note to self, best play this one first, seems VERY unwieldy and maybe too sensitive, though likely much less so in 2 player and 2P apparently works very well. Reviews very mixed and many on the low side tried multiple times to like it, might be mostly an experience game

Edit - watched the gameplay video. Damn blind bidding where you lose money, its one of my most hated mechanics and I usually want to tweak it right out of the gate like lose half rounded up. Secret objectives that have end game conditions on them (so random end game pretty much), exploring is random but it's mostly a euro with a heavy nego element and interesting semi-coop element. There are a lot of things to track, you have nice options for actions, interesting each game has a different “theme” and team goal to shoot for. A little similar to age of empires from glen drover, could be a 6 to 8 for me

Archipelago is a rather controversial game.  The theme is that of European imperialist powers colonizing an archipelago of islands filled with natives.  It is a civilization genre game with worker placement (there is a board where you get to set out 3-5 discs on action spaces) where you expand the map by exploring, gathering resources, and then using them to build churches, ports, markets, towns, and boats or selling them for money.  There is a semi-coop element in that the discontent level of the natives tends to rise over time, exacerbated by crises every turn and certain otherwise lucrative actions.  If the natives revolt then everyone loses.  There are also wonders to be built and special tech/personality cards that provide useful abilities.  There is a lot of negotiation and bidding over turn order and who gets control of how the common resources are used to meet the constant crises.  The most contentious part of the game is that it has mostly secret scoring goals and end conditions with each player being dealt a card with one of each and then you have to figure out what cards the other players got.  This tends to be difficult unless you've played a lot, with the result that you didn't really know what to be working towards and the game ends unexpectedly.  I think this can be fixed with the simple (official) variant rule that all these cards are public knowledge instead of secret.  The only drawback is that doing so nullifies the interesting twist that one of the cards is a traitor card where you win if the natives revolt.  Perhaps one could have a further variant where there is always a traitor and allocation of that role is on a separate card that is secret.

Intimidating rules at first, but it actually plays really smoothly.

The map you make during play is just gorgeous- one of the nicest looking boards I've seen. Every archipelago comes out totally differently.

Edit: Bringing down the rating some. It's an excellent game, but I just can't get myself excited to teach and play it again.

I think the best way to play this is probably 4 player with the medium or long time frame.  The short-game feels premature.  

rating for 5p: 7 because too much downtime.

1st game was a 6 because we didn't know to prep against the separatist or underestimated the domestic crisis.

2nd game of 5p was a 8 but I didn't like a few things, a rookie player getting the separatist, and also the short version of the game seems too short, but with 5p it was already 4 hours long.  

long complex games need to be epic to be worth it, and I don't think this game achieves that

Initial Rating: 7.0 (December 2012)

As my favorite game ever is Dungeon Twister, and I also really like the theme and gameplay of Earth Reborn, It was natural for me to try Archipelago. My first impression is that the game is great, it is a meaty game with many rules, but once you begin playing it, everything flows naturally and it is easier to play that you initially thought. Still the game has a satisfying depth so it is a keeper for me.

I don’t particularly like the theme, in fact, at least 2 friends refused to play Archipelago based on the theme alone, the theme doesn’t bother me, but it doesn’t excite me either. The gameplay is great, I love the negotiation required, the tension of the game, the crisis, the worker placement facet (there is so much to do and so little workers) and the way we can all lose if we don’t collaborate enough. Great.

The components are very nice (as usual), the art is also pretty cool.

On the bad side, the short game is not worth it, it finishes too quickly, better to begin with the medium game. Also I’m concerned with the luck factor inherent in the game, the exploration tiles has a lot of luck but I’m worried particularly about the end of game conditions and the variable objectives. I´m not sure about this, but It seems one player has an unfair advantage over the others when finishing the setup or when the game finishes. I would not like a meaty game like this one to be decided by luck, I will have to play again to see if this is a silly concern or if luck governs more than I like.  

For now I would like to play more Archipelago, this is another great game from a great designer. (Christophe Boelinger)

I have played a couple 5 hour games (medium length), that’s way too long, however I also have played quicker games so the game length is very variable. I´m not sure how I feel about this. The time passes quickly though.

I’m downgrading its rating to a 6.0, because I feel the luck of the goals (and exploration) is more than I like. If a player has the same hidden goal and the same trend card, he has a very unfair advantage (7 VPs if first on that category) as one can almost always be first in a category if pursued single-mindedly.

Another issue, when a player is sure he is not winning the game, he can easily throw away the game via revolution, I dislike this but I have seen it happen twice. It is even worse in a 4 hour+ game.

I still like Archipelago a lot, however I usually don’t want to play it, so it is a 6.0 for me. A game that I would like to play  from time to time.

Current Rating: 6.0

Now, I don’t want to play this almost never. It takes a long time for what It offers, and I really hate that a player can throw the game if he feels he is not winning. I have come to see this as a major roadblock for me. 

Current Rating: 5.5

RATING: 8
Archipelago is my surprise hit of the Essen '12 season.

On first glance it appears to be a fairly straightforward worker placement exploration and market manipulation game.  The genius comes from two elements - the relentlessness of the rebellion and the hidden objectives.

Of the several "all players lose" semi-coop games I've had the pleasure of playing, Archipelago's loss mechanic is just about the harshest this side of Republic of Rome's Early Republic.  The domestic crises are capricious and will hit the players mercilessly unless beaten back by otherwise suboptimal domestic market sales.  This game requires unselfishness among the leaders, otherwise the rebels will win.  God help the colonists if one of the players has the Separatist goal.

Once the players are educated enough to keep the rebellion in check, the focus turns to how to become the "grand winner."  Archipelago borrows one of the more delightful mechanics from Troyes, the hidden objectives.  One can and should deduce other players' objectives once the game has passed a few turns.  It goes without saying that one's own hidden objective is paramount.

The special powers of the evolution cards are quite varied and look to provide a substantial amount of interplay variability as does the exploration.  After 5 plays I doubt I've seen a tenth of the different configurations this game has to offer.

The negotiation is fluid and though there is potential for backstabbing, there's also a lot of latitude for players to execute win-win deals with a little trust.

A solid 8, perhaps a 9 with a few more plays, and well deserving of a place in my collection.

A buffet of modern euro mechanisms that surprisingly works, though I find it a bit overwrought for my tastes. The game features an interesting push and pull core; the mechanisms pull you toward long-term engine-building while the hidden-game-ending triggers/VPs push you toward a short-term sprint to the top.

Several members of my group really like Archipelago. I enjoy the concept more than its execution.

A strange game. Many new mechanics and the semi-coop aspect is a real threat unlike some other games. But it's hard to have a sense of progression in this game when there's so much unknown. Most of time you feel like treading water until the game ends suddenly.

The exploration aspect is physically the most annoying part of the game, because it's hard to visualize if a tile fits the desired location without taking out the tile (since you can't reveal the next one).

The components are somewhat poor quality, very thin boards and tokens, and the main board is too small.

Will definitely try again to get a better sense of this one.

High learning curved worker placement exploration game. It took is like 3 games to figure out how badly we'd screwed up the rules.

I've seen professional game reviewers on youtube blatantly play this game wrong and nobody even notices.

Still, it's a beautiful game (especially on TTS) and it really makes you think. The supply/desmand economy tracks are a great and original way of introducing dynamic economies to the board. But yes, consider this one a time sink. One of the games prevailing virtues is that there are short, middle, and long variations to choose from, allowing for different time commitments/depth -- the expansion adds a lot more of an aggressive element if that's your thing.

level of interaction is high! Last night I was using the Barbarian to burn my opponents resource spaces out : )

I am not sure how great it will be with multiple players. I don't particularly like hidden objectives but if it's even half as good as the solo game then I would still play it whenever I can.

Feels like having a regular high tea with your fellow Dutch colonist buddies. Discussing how to best exploit those pesky natives. At the same time you have to get your newly discovered aboriginal economy up and running.

Long objective games will take around 5 hours, but they never feel like a drag. Lots of haggling, betting, discussing and back-stabbing. One Archipel ago they were your friend, and now...
The high player interaction makes for little downtime.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Archipelago is a group-dependent game with negotiations being one of the elements. To take off, it needs experienced players who use negotiations to blackmail, bribe, charm or betray other players. If players play mostly for themselves, the game has serious potential to tank. It also includes hidden victory and game end conditions. These could be deduced for probably half of the players by their actions but some uncertainty remains. It's no game for control freaks. It's possibly best for Eurogamers who like themselves some conflict or Ameritrashers who occasionally dive into Euro waters which this time are situated in the Caribbean thematically. 
Actually, theme is one of its strengths. Other strengths include variety, strategic depth and suspense regarding the conditions in play. Luck of the draw can be a drawback as well as a rulebook that leaves players with a lot of ambiguities. It's more of a framework within which players interact rather than a tight frame that is played by the players (e.g. Terra Mystica). 
I enjoyed my first play and would join again if it is the right group. Not sure though if this will rise or fall with further plays.

I can see why some people would like this game. It is definitely meaty, there are a lot of things going on and a lot of choices to make on your turn.

However, I really dislike the cooperative aspect of the game. I don't have a blanket dislike for games where there is an "all lose" possibility. Terra is an example of a game where I feel it's handled pretty well. The problem in Archipelago is that there's not very much incentive to try and ward off the losing condition. In our game, players were being greedy, and though I could have prevented us from losing, I decided to just give up and let us lose the game. I realize that this is not in the spirit of the game, but at least in our group, I can't see it ever working out any differently.

Fairly long and involved semi-cooperative worker placement game. The hidden game ending conditions and uncertain scoring conditions make for a very interesting game. The semi-cooperative nature of the game is not everyone's cup of tea though. Needs players who see a difference between losing and being second.

Great game but a bittersweet feeling at the end. The victory point count its odd. I have now mixed feelings about it. So few points after so much efforts!. Have to play with more people.
I played a lot solo, its a great solo puzzle, its hard as hell and needs luck , but its a great solo.
The problem with the endgame could be solved with longer games. I will try.

Only 1 play, but seems much too long to be as random as it is.  I won jumped out to an early lead in the known end game condition based solely on the starting tile I selected and no one ever really got close.  I guess that would be acceptable in a 20-30 minute game, but in a 45-60+ minute game I just can't see the appeal.

Had enough interesting stuff where I would give it one more try.

There are definitely translation issues in the rulebook. What the rulebook says is never wrong, but the conclusion you would most likely get to from the rulebook alone is wrong in some cases. There also redundant sentences on some cards and paragraphs which (in English at least) lead you away from what would have been the right answer and cause confusion.

If you are willing to read a few FAQ's, and clarifications from the designer to get the rules straight, it is however a brilliant game.

A wonderfully thematic Euro.  The semi-co-op approach gives the game quite a unique feel.  Euro fans who like low interaction should avoid this.  I'm a fan of the designer's other games, and appreciate how he's tried to deliver a really rich experience not often found in Euros.

There's a lot going on in this game and it can take a long time to play (even when playing the short game).  This is one of those games that you have to play repeatedly in order to begin to understand the strategy. Due to the length of play, the complexity, and the nature of my gaming opportunities, this will probably never get played again.  This fact doesn't bother me.

A nice thing about this game is the time that it give you to make use of what you built and harvested, this was one of my problems with Keyflower and this game did it a lot better, but some details about this game I don't like, I think the crises cards could have been handled a lot better, the character cards are a bit messy more complicated than they should be, I also think that the way actions happen could have been done in a better way. But it is a very good game over all.

A semi-cooperative action selection game, with hidden scoring. Players take turns moving around and exploring an archipelago, building up the island via towns, temples, and ports, and buying/selling on the domestic and export markets. The game ends once one of a player's secret objectives is completed. I didn't care for the semi-cooperative aspect of the game and the hidden scoring, but otherwise the core mechanics of the game are solid.

Beautiful art and sold adherence to theme makes this game an intuitive joy to play.

Contains a mixture of various game mechanics and combines them all well. Hardest aspect is un-learning how other worker placement and set collection type games play as maximising your workers and hoarding materials will have negative effects and could lose the game for everyone bar the traitor, if present. Difficult to get used to not knowing how to score victory points and it's possible for one person to get more victory points from their starting region than another player playing for 3 hours - I know because it's happened to me! Every game will be long.

RATING: 9.6
Pretty, open-ended and elegantly chaotic. A fine blend of miscellaneous mechanisms very well put together, with its outstanding semi-coop character separating it from everything else I've played.
Suspicion, intrigue and bartering; with the uncertainty of when one of the hidden game ending conditions will be triggered always looming over. All these without the number crunching ending part since each player knows only part of the scoring criteria.

I love the artwork and ideas in this game, and I think it is an experience most interested gamers should give a go. It is a unique mix.

However for the time you spend playing the game you often feel a little short changed. This is primarily due to the hidden game ending and victory point conditions, which can make the ending come as a slight shock, and the dilution (by time) of interesting individual player decisions by the auctions and negotiations (as well as the updating of the various boards).

With some efficiency in bookkeeping this game really shines, but ultimately falls slightly short for me.

Interesting but very fiddly and the short game may not be that short!  Lots of bits and a beautiful if not quite functional board.  The action board is to small but I imagine that the large footprint of this game required smaller boards.  One person can potentially win or force everyone to lose by forcing the natives into revolt which means everyone loses unless you have that goal card.  This could get frustrating as this would force the others to carry the load much more in paying for the negative events.

Really interesting game.  A mishmash of lots of familiar mechanics, so while the rules are heavy, it all just makes sense after the first round.  

What I like the most about this game is also its detriment: the hidden end-game conditions.  In my experience, the game is just SO LONG, and this is really the main factor keeping this from getting more play. 

I think the game will only get better with more experienced players.  The more intimate with the game, the better you can watch and deduce other player's goals. That would increase the strategy AND end the game sooner.

I can definitely see this being a great game for the right crowd, but this game is definitely not for me. It's not even just the fact that I'm not a fan of such open negotiation in games, or that you need a very specific play style in the group so someone doesn't just tank the semi-coop aspect if they are losing. There's also the metagaming of who has what scoring conditions (with no player aids to help with the attempted deduction), but most importantly the rules in this game feel very unintuitive. For example, the pricing of the special powers cards. The turning mechanism to change price and mill the market feels very tacked on and since you also turn to activate the ability it feels like thematically the two should have been tied better together. There's also the bidding for turn order (which admittedly is in a lot of Euros these days, but the addition here adds another layer of mechanism discord with the theme), exactly why the markets and workers ready to hire are tied with the rebellion track, and the messy looking worker placement board (also not regarding its level of intuitiveness, but I wish there was more blocking in the worker placement aspect). Overall this lack of intuitiveness caused the game to really have no narrative for me. Finally, there are many little things in the rules that if you forget one of them can spell disaster to the balance of the game.

RATING: 7
In many ways this is a civilization type Euro with semi-cooperative mechanics.  You have many different routes you can take where you build various building, explore, gather resources.  It has 3 of the 4 x's in a 4x game.  But scoring is interesting, in that you have a secret goal for each player and a public goal.  Unless you can guess the other players goals, it is very hard to affect the outcome in the end.  

I like the game enough to want to play again, but a few issues.  The short game is about the right length, but is so short you cannot discern goals.  I played a 5 player medium game with 2 AP prone players and it went forever 4 hours.  It is hard to teach.  Having said all that, I think it is a great game.  I would like to own it but a friend does so I don't need to buy it.

So this game has got bone-and teeth adorned brown-skinned maniacs waving around torches and bone clubs amongst various other Eurocentric bullshit, so maybe not a game for the, shall we say, "culturally sensitive" members of your group. Actually comes with a useful box insert, so that's cool.

Played solo with 2 players.
Rule book in hand throughout. Heavy going. It's ok but you don't really know what is best to do and there are a lot of choices. Needs a cheat sheet. 

With Agricola , I always felt I could see the goal. With this, some of then things I don't know the purpose of (ore for example). Needs more plays and I think will be hard to teach.

I didn't feel rebellion was ever a danger so that probably means I was doing something wrong

Semi-cooperative, hidden agendas.  Slightly complicated, but incredible game for my group that includes everything we love.

Traded everything Zpocalypse other than Zmaster and the set of extra zombie hordes and hospital horde for this and the Solo expansion.

Feel like between Agricola worker placement that I still very much enjoy, and Eclipse for expand and exploit, this will always gather dust in favor of something else.  As SUSD said, it does take a couple play throughs to really have the rules down before the game opens up - and since my gaming group is much larger than 5, I'm discovering I'll have a new person nearly every time in the future, and that's one person not having fun each game.  With Agricola's worker placement variety (and eventually Caverna) and Euphoria being much easier to teach to newcomers, and the diplomacy in some other games, this just wasn't going to end up filling a need in my collection.

Traded on here for Euphoria.

A wonderful game.  At its heart it is simply a Euro Worker Placement game, a type of game that usually leaves me indifferent.  However, the game takes this basic Worker Placement mechanic and elevates in in many ways.  It has a strong theme, excellent production values (except for the coins), strong interaction, and good mechanics.  It's easy to teach and play, with little downtime.  You can focus on the game, and have many options and freedom to play the game as you like.  I like the hidden shared victory conditions, and the possibility of having a traitor.  The semi-coop works well, the game feels competitive but also cooperative  A game with depth, immersion, interaction, beautiful components, and intrigue.  Definitely a keeper in my collection, I look forward to returning to this archipelago often.

First of all, this one is stunning to look at.  Next, this game provides a rather stark examination of colonialism.  Players are exploiting the locals and their resources and only pay them mind when it comes to trouble times.  Even then, rather than truly work together, players are incentivized to try and contribute the bare minimum amount.  Add onto that the hidden knowledge of end game scoring (a plus in my eyes) and Archipelago is a game I need to pull out sooner rather than later.

Despite being bad at winning this game, it's still a lot of fun to play.  Archipelago is about the journey.  The design is just gorgeous, physically and gameplay-wise.  Everything is bright and colorful.  The domestic and export markets, as well as the worker and dissident pools, function in an interesting and LOGICAL fashion. Of course letting the unemployed pile up creates people who aren't happy with you!  You bought all the fish on the market?  Great, thanks, now it's expensive.

The rulebook is terrifying, but really, it's set up to be logical and to follow a nice flow.  Playing it is a breeze.

You and your friends will play together in mostly a jovial and peaceful fashion (usually...), all the while scrutinizing everyone's actions and occasionally pressing your luck with others' kindness.  Fun and interesting.

I played just the short version and I found it somehow disappointing. Not bad mechanics but also nothing special or innovative. I expected more from Boelinger as I like very much his previous designs.I would play it again, probably a full game, and maybe I'll change my rating.

EDIT: Played two more games (medium 3-p) and (long 2-p). This time I enjoyed both games. So I raise my initial ranking of 6. It's definitely a good design but I think it can't keep my interesting for many games. I don't like the extremely close scoring. Usually whoever buys the most evolution VP cards win.

I can't give a rating to this game yet, but I must say that in my fist play I was pretty confused about what to do in the game, it seems that the competitive side of the game is not totally clear. Anyway I've to play it again to make up my mind about it.

... BTW, I have a lot of downtime playing it for the first time.

-----------------------------------------------------------

Score: 8.0

Well, finally I managed to play again last saturday, and I have to say that this time was a quite plesantly experience. 

The game is gorgeous, I doubt anyone can argue against that, but besides that I found it to be very fun to play. Anyway I'm sure is not a game for everyone (especially for casual players as is rules-dense and somehow time expensive), and I think that is designed to be played with the same group over and over, as is very time consuming to explain the rules and more time consuming to get used to them. 

A specially controversial topic IMHO are the end game conditions, that can make difficult to a newcommer to understand his objective in the game, and to know in a given momment of the game if he is winning or not. But once you are able to grasp the idea behind secret and multiple ending games, I think it makes a very interesting mechanich.

I can't wait to play it again!

Talk about your heavy euros with lots of rules!  

This is an enjoyable exploration game with many meaningful decisions to make each round.  However, the sheer amount of rules, the text on all the evolution cards, and the secret objectives make it daunting at first.  (I think I'll have all the rules down quickly, but still need to use references for all the cards and objectives for some time to come.)

Also, the actions that engage/don't engage the meeples, or actions you can take when they already are/aren't engaged, is confusing.  Luckily there's a nice player aid here on BGG--otherwise it'd be a nightmare of consulting the rulebook every turn for your first few plays.

A good experience, overall, but it probably won't become a favorite.  I put this somewhere in the "7" range right now.

I want to like this game but I can't quite.  It's complex but not fun.  The mechanics make sense but are limiting.  It's almost a great game, really, but the whole doesn't add up.  There are some fun aspects - exploring and obtaining resources - and other aspects that make sense - market prices vary, unhappy populations - but it feels very jumbled together.  Add in the ugly native stereotypes and, meh.

An interesting game with a lot going on. After 6 or so plays (3P and 4P), initial rating is a 7.  Not bad, kind of all of the place when each game plays.  Plenty of luck along with interesting decisions.  Just something missing for us.  Prefer other games, not sure how much more this will make it to the table.

(comments based on short game)

Beautifully produced game with good ideas, but some gaping holes in the mechanics which lead to dead ends. The foreign market seems extraneous, lucky/unlucky tile draws can seriously swing the game balance, a single player can end the game on a whim and cause everyone to lose, the market can be bled dry of resources with no way to re-stock. I really dislike how three of the five victory/end game condition cards are unknown to each player, so that you score (or don't) mostly by accident and how turn order is bid on, but you always lose the money you bid, even if you lost the auction!

Simply, the game has too many 'leaks' and ways to grind to a halt, or be 'crashed' by players and it never feels like you know what you're aiming for. Maybe in the longer game (if you knew all the cards) you could guess other players' victory conditions.

(after more plays)
I am coming around a bit to this one, but I still don't like the ability of a single player to hog a resource and deny it to everyone - Soak up all the stone and nobody can even build! Much better if you know all the potential scoring and end-game conditions.

A lot going on in this game, with economy building, map exploration, variable secret VP conditions like Troyes (but with a bigger selection making it had to keep a track of).  In 2017 this game seems a bit unpolished.  It isn't a game suited to casual play.  Lots of rules overhead.  Almost like the designer continued to add elements - but the game doesn't seem to be more than the sum of its parts.  Contrast to something like Clash of cultures, which has economy building, tech tree, building placement and tile discovery but has a more streamlined ruleset, and Archipelago loses out.

Maintaining the 9.5 rating after 9 plays. The game holds itself up as a exploration + building + market game as a 2p game and plus negotiation when at higher player count. The rules [i]are[/i] a little bit fiddly at first but it plays smoothly enough after a round or two. The semi-coop is tricky though as honestly, no one ever wants to contribute.

It is a very good game once you understand it thoroughly. It definitely gets better with the number of plays (at least up to ~20 games).

It also plays great with only two players.

I really really wanted to like this one, and to some extent it intrigues me - especially as to why it just doesn't quite work for me.

A rather simple but fiddly worker-placement system (with barely any blocking) drives the board play which is a shared set of hexes making up the Archipelago. Hidden goal cards for every player means that guesstimating your overall standing is very difficult. A shared loss condition is an overarching threat throughout the game. I love the idea, that players who feel left out of contention can drag down those that are, either forcing the draw or levelling the playing field. Then, when a player feels ahead, they must strike to end the game before the cycle repeats, either through their known end condition or what they suspect might be someone elses.

Now, why doesn't it work for me and my group? Well, first, mostly due to my group. This game is fragile, with a capital crystal F. At any point, if a player doesn't care that much about the game, the game is over and done. Someone who does something just "because it would be fun", and the game goes to pieces. Fine, don't play with those people (easier said than done for me). Second, and this is more my personal qualms with the game - the blind bidding is a turn-off, requiring too many plays to really understand the value of (which again, results in the game breaking as others fail to see the point and start mucking about) - also, the pace of the game, each action drives the game but an inch and the board as a whole feels meaningless, the cost to move away from your original position is too great, the time spent setting up a greater play is rarely worth it - also, there are no "greater" plays in terms of effect - it's always "get one fruit", "get two stone", "build a church", "build a port", never a surprise and never anything well, exciting? Interaction on the board is a costly affair, seldom worth it. And the granularity in the scoring, well it isn't there. One stone, one church, one card, and you can get zero points or all the points. And you are supposed to infer your standing based on this? I suppose it could be done, but ye... I guess ultimately the game might be too tight, and too loose all at once, I can't even rant very coherently about it...

Meh, it just left me with a meh,. The core concept is intriguing, the mechanisms sound (well, on the surface at least) and the end result should have been something great, but it isn't. Not for me and the people I play with. Maybe someday, with someone else? I hope so.

I remember really enjoying this game on my first gameplay when someone else taught it to me, but later on when I finally acquired my own copy and set out to teach it, the game just fell flat. It was hard to summarize, hard to teach, and just didn't work for the group, then it sat on my shelf for a long time without getting to the table, so even though I know it can be good, it just had no place in my gaming world, at least not with me as the teacher.

Es un juego de una tensión mayúscula que se mantiene a lo largo de todo el partida gracias a los objetivos ocultos. Este es uno de los puntos mas controvertidos del juego, porque junto a dicho objetivo aparece la condición de final del mismo, dando la posibilidad de finalizarlo a cualquier jugador. Personalmente a mi me parece uno de los puntos vitales del producto.  Como decía al principio, la incertidumbre es una constante que mantiene el clímax durante toda la partida. Desconocer el objetivo de tus oponentes y su condición de final de juego te hace desconfiar de todo y de todos.

It really requires a group who appreciates the game and can play it often enough that they are wrestling each other rather than learning the game. 

I kind of regret getting rid of this, though I know it wouldn't get played enough to bother playing it at all.

Archipelago is a mish-mash of your usual Euro mechanisms grafted onto a couple twists that were theoretically interesting but failed in practice for me. First was the semi-cooperative avoidance of a "rebellion," which ultimately just taxes the player(s) in the lead: if you're already losing, you don't care, but if you think you'll win, you are forced to help put down the revolt. Second are the secret endgame and scoring conditions each player is dealt at the start of the game. I'm not sure what kind of game play this is supposed to inspire, but it really took a lot away from the game for me. Instead of feeling like I should explore the myriad options available to me, I felt locked into whatever my card said. Moreover, the scoring condition on the public scoring card happened to match resources on the tile I'd "explored" during the game set-up, so I had a huge advantage before the game even began. Of course, this might peter out over the course of a long game, but really how long can anyone endure converting cubes into money, tiles, cards, and other cubes?

Thus, on game play alone, I really have no interest in ever playing this again, which would get a 3 from me. But then there's the theme, which takes this into the realm of visceral loathing. Call me "sensitive" or hypocritical--somehow I don't have a problem with the Slave counters in Struggle of Empires and have managed to excuse the brown "colonists" brought on ships to work the fields in Puerto Rico--but this was just too much. The game puts players in the position of implicitly celebrating the most insidious and patriarchal aspects of colonial imperialism. Players "lose" if the natives gain independence. Religion, "education," and hard labor are all tools to pacify a primitive population apparently doing nothing worthwhile prior to occupation. This deplorable theme made this game difficult for me to play, and I hope I never come anywhere near it again.

This game has so many interesting mechanics, but yet...somehow still feels boring. You are doing so much, yet in the end it means so little. As to explain, there is no "whole game trying to do this/those things and have a sense of accomplishment when I manage to perform it at the end" like Tzolkin, Trajan, there is no "It's over? already? Man, I had so many things still planned..." like Puerto Rico or Agricola, yet it has elements from these games. 
In the end it's either gets too long and it's starts to feel a bit tedious or it just fails to deliver the "kick" at the end. 

Yea, this game is best described as not having that "kick", that you get from playing other games.

I really like this game. I never owned it but a gaming buddy did and we played it a few times. It's big, beautiful, and a good level of deep. I enjoyed the hidden victory conditions and the 'traitor' who works with the people to foment rebellion is a really fun roll to play. But even just playing a 'straight' game the exploration and building is really enjoyable. Was very sad when they traded this away.

A truly hearty euro of exploration, resource management with a twist of secret roles and objectives. Not so long in play-time that is generally said, but it also depends on the players (downtime effect).

As some people say ... you win Archipelago by just playing it (but never play the small game, only medium and large).

Maybe there are too many things going on, work placement exploration, trade, building, cards etc but this is what I like about it. Also a nice theme, especially the fact that natives might make a revolution, losing the game for the players is something I really like

I downloaded the rules as soon as they were available. It seems a great game, with lot of choices, although some would state that 20 pages of rules, where every word is significant is a little too much...
Also very good looking contents !

UPDATE: Last night I finished reading the rules for the second time. So, the following things:
- Nice components
- Strong theme supported by the mechanisms
- Nicely written rulebook (I try to find something that is not covered and I found nothing!)
- Many options & things to do and take care of
- Many variants in the basic game
- Promise for a solo option
- Semi-cooperative
- High player interaction
- Hidden objectives
- option for game length

...make it an immediate buy and put the other 10's in my gallery in jeopardy...

Good bye forever Puerto Rico and other similar games. Archipelago is a complex, well designed game. In the future, when the itch of markets, colonists, products, ships is claiming to be scratched, Archipelago is the game that will hit the table.

RATING: 6
I really do quite like this game - very close to love. It has some very interesting ideas, and it feels extremely different from any other game I've played. There's so much open space - freedom. In some ways it feels like the polar opposite of Agricola, which has a cold, unwavering 14 turns and a goal of having "a fair deal of everything." This game could end at any time, and the goals are extremely specific and different each game. It is refreshing in some ways, but I do feel like I could never take this game "seriously" in the same way I would take most euros, as the winner is often as surprised as everyone else that he won. Definitely worth playing and getting to know this system though, there's a lot of cool stuff going on!

UPDATE: The excitement wore off really fast on this one - gameplay is too messy, too many vague rules, and takes forever to teach to new players for an experience that just isn't really worth it. From a 9 to a 6 - may trade this one away.

UPDATE: Traded for Suburbia

[b]Archipelago[/b] by [person=1206][/person] (Dungeon Twister, Earth Reborn...)

[image=1640388][/image]

2-5 players (or 1 with the solo expansion)

Expansions:
- Solo 
- War&Peace 
- a [url=https://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/21766819#21766819]new expansion[/url] with 18 new tiles is in the works (the French Caribbean island of Guadeloupe is mentioned in Essen 2015 interview)

Archipelago is a unique game, a keeper for me, which is getting played. Due to its nature (modular board, numerous evolution cards and game mechanics, varying objectives), every game will be different. I can also imagine easily house-ruling this one to make it even better. Yes, I believe there is great potential here to improve an already great game, and the solid rulebook needs to be improved upon (by Paul Grogan?).

The game also seems to be very well suited to future expansions. So far, there are 2 expansions: Solo and War&Peace. I have not come across any newer game, which is similar that could replace it.

True, it has a number of things to be constantly aware of to do well in multi-player (such as the 10 hidden objectives), but as far as rules go it's no Mage Knight, it is more a Caylus. There are some rules that might need researching in the forums, so for future reference take notes whenever something odd has been clarified to you. 

Thus far, I have played only solo and 2-player games. 

-Solo has been an entertaining puzzle, and a good way to learn the game (Note: for solo games you must purchase the solo expansion)

-2-player has been competitive fun, and avoiding a rebellion has been both challenging and a source of negotiation. My gf and I love this game.

-3-5 players. I expect more players shall have more varied negotiations and a new dimension of diplomacy shall be added. A sense of suspicion as well, since one of the player's game objectives may be to incite a rebellion. A timer might be necessary for players with analysis paralysis.

As with Tigris & Euphrates, though via different mechanism (the hidden objective cards), I like how you don't know who is leading the game till the very end, but can only make an educated guess (there are 10 possible objectives), that is, unless you are able to hire the Spy to seek out more information on your opponents´ objectives.

Update:
Haven´t played this enough times yet, and mostly 2-player, but it feels like it ends too quickly, just when you start to enjoy your "empire building". It has to do with the hidden objectives, which can be at times too easy to attain. Perhaps it's just player inexperience, but if game play doesn't develop into a slightly longer back-and-forth struggle, the game will need more tweaking to make it truly shine. As such it feels too much like a race. But perhaps that would then be another game, or something for an expansion to address.

Possible "fixes": 
1) for objectives choose a higher player count (ex. for 2-player games, use the objectives for 3-players)

2) trend card (the public objective) could be replaced with  harder objectives, which you can not simply race for (such as X fish), but must struggle over (such as...?).

Played once.
A cohesive sort of game between the marketplace and population boards, action selection, and the developing map.  Then the evolution cards leave me scratching my head, as they seem to jar - even though they might well complete the game mechanically.  Needs more plays for me to form an opinion, although it does seem like there are more compelling games around.

Semikooperative Spiele sind nicht so mein Ding. Das musste ich bei Archipelago erneut feststellen. Zu oft kommt die Frage auf "Warum sollte ich das jetzt machen? Warum sollte ich mich aufopfern für die Runde, und damit Rohstoffe einbüßen?". Das Spiel ist zwar gut durchdacht (und hinterlässt so einen weitaus besseren Eindruck als das "Herr der Ringe Dice Building Game"), aber überzeugt auf Anhieb nicht. Was im Unterschied zum erwähnten Spiel schön ist, ist die Verräterkomponente, die möglicherweise bei Archipelago eine Rolle spielen kann. Eventuell hätte es noch eine Chance verdient, aber die Spieldauer verlockt auch nicht gerade dazu.

RATING: 7
There's a lot to get your head around in this game at the start, but once you've had a round or two then you get the hang of it.

I think what's hardest to understand is that EVERYTHING can be negotiated. Turn order is just the start. The game rounds can play very fast too, the limited number of actions you can do means that you are not really stuck with left over actions that you need to find something useful to do with.

However, there is a lot of luck in the game, if you do not get a decent spread of resources then you will have to spend actions exploring in the hope you get the tiles, or actions on the market/port to get those resources.

Upon reflection, the hidden end game conditions are quite irritating and give you no direction to move in, you just have to study the manual all game and hope you can work out what the other players are doing (usually too late to affect anything).

I felt Archipelago had a bit too much game going on.  I absolutely hated how the person whom won the bid got to dictate the rest of the order.  I also was not a huge fan of BOTH end game conditions PLUS end game scoring were hidden values only to be shown at the end of the game.  

Besides these qualms the game was just OK.  I like the plenty of options available to you, but this combined with everything else going on kind of made a mish-mash of various game mechanics that tried to do too much to be swallowed in one sitting.  

I would play this game again, but it's tough with the amount of new games I want to play vs. the amount of time I actually get to play ANY game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.25
There is absolutely no individual component in Archipelago that you haven't seen before, right down to the generic meeples.  Yet Archipelago is one of my favorites.

Not since Endeavor has a Euro-game so expertly captured the feel of colonization (there's probably a wargame or two that does a better job).  Each game tells a story as dictated by the trend card and endgame cards.  Our first told of the masses coming to the islands; our last game was one of proselytization and converting the natives.  Every element of gameplay feeds into this epic tale.  There are tight choices that stand before you each turn with your limited resources and actions.  You need to stay focused on the known victory conditions, yet you can never know them all... and so you must diversify.  You'll need to wheel and deal with your collaborators in order to come out on top.  And you'll need to watch your colleagues like a predator and see what they cherish in order to do likewise.

Because at the heart of this admittedly messy Frankenstein's Monster combination of mechanics is a game of politics.  You need to take steps to secure victory while simultaneously keeping the natives at peace -- not an easy task.  They may as well called this game The Republic of the West Indies.

Finally, the artwork is insane.  You're getting your moneys worth here in bits alone, much less the narratives and the intense politicking that Archipelago will invoke.

People have been asking for decades when there will be a Civ killer.  I'm calling the body at 6:26 CST, November 5, 2012.  It's not going to be everyone's cuppa, but Archipelago is my new Civ.

Great game, many decisions, many paths to victory, many random elements to grant replayability and it's very difficult to lose all hopes of winning until the very end, because you don't know other people's objectives...

It's not a thematic game, but the theme is there, it leads you to believe you are colonizing an acrhipelago and all the mechanics are very well integrated with the theme.

All the elements work very well, the actions, the materials, the economy, the progress cards, the buildings, the map tiles, they all settle in very well in global game.

I was quite concerned about the bad luck with the tiles distribution, but I was surprised at how well it managed not having a decent variety of resources (I almost won my first game [tied, in fact] after having only pineapples in my 3 tiles during almost all the game). Much better than some great games like Eclipse and Twilight Imperium.

The art is quite good, I love everything but the circular board...


One big problem: it's semi-cooperative. I don't like this kind of games, I don't enjoy the ambiance they create and several other consecuences, but this is not as bad as others, because people won't lose their hope until the very end, all are motivated to contribute towards the global well-being.

A secondary problem is its lenght.

I would rate it at least 1 point higher if it were not a semi-cooperative. Still, the best semi-cooperative I've ever tried :-)

Still, it's a game I bough because of the solo experience (still to be tested) and I'm willing to play again with real people :)

RATING: 4
This game has serious identity issues. At the first glance, the box size and price tag deliver a false promise of plastic pirates and dice rolling. On a second look, the huge amount of wooden pieces and market matrices make you expect some heavy-duty resource management.

When you get to the rulebook, it soon becomes clear how completely the attempts at adding a thematic game on top the resource management derail the entire package: 
- Rulebook is full of holes
- Blind bidding for turn order
- Free negotiation
- 'Everybody loses' end condition
- Horribly out of place, chaotic and complex special power cards

And finally, during the game, other failings become obvious:
- Poor and confusing graphic design. The most glaring issue, but certainly not the only one, is choosing not to use the native head icons on the island tiles.
- If a player wants to throw a game and ruin it for everyone, rushing for either his personal secret end condition or the 'everybody loses' option is too easy.

Also, the fact that the action selection scheme does not restrict other players from choosing the same action just does not feel right. There probably is a reason for such a non-blocking system (for example, meeple movements on island tiles actually do create some blockage/timing considerations) but for my group it just made the gameplay feel unsatisfactory. And the huge swings in the end scoring even more so.

This is great. It's essentially worker placement, but with a enough bells and whistles to distract and entertain.  I love the semi-cooperative elements and the possibility of a saboteur, the ambiguous victory conditions (which reduces any tedious number crunching), as well as the interaction and negotiation. And it all looks fantastic, especially the island tiles. The designer says he tried to create a worker placement game with a non-superficial theme and lots of interaction; job done. I would say that the rules could be better as there are a few ambiguities and situations that aren't covered.

There is just so much to do in the game, and not all of it will be helpful. This game plays much better with an experienced group who know the game objectives because then bluffing starts seeping in. 2/12/2015

Expansions:
War & Peace

Verdict:

What I Like: The chance of a traitor being in the midst. The strangeness of playing two games at once, a cooperative survival game and a competitive civ game. Observing how this creates a dual mind with twisted motives in both myself and others, especially considering the free trade/bribery rule. The tile art is stunningly gorgeous when connected into a cohesive map. The hidden objectives add a fun deduction/bluffing aspect to the game.

What I Don't Like: So many fiddly bits to move and track! The short game is way too short. The medium game is too long. Not ever going to try the long game. This game will not work well with some people due to its above mentioned two-game nature. Can lead to hurt feelings through broken trust.

The short game is waaay to short, and the medium game is barely adequate. Rated 7/10 for the long game.

End conditions are secret and may feel arbitrary/random at first. Only with several plays do you begin to have a feel for when the game will end. This can be a bit frustrating. Otherwise the game is engaging from the outset and easy to play. I don't [i]love[/i] Archipelago, there is a little too much chaos, but I do like it a lot.

Underneath the surface of a super dull worker placement cube pusher lies a considerably communicative, interactive and thematically sound game, but it's a bit too dragging and has other problems, too: bidding for player sequence (positions seem irrelevant except for 1st player), lacking incentives for engagement in crisis. I haven't figured out yet how significant these issues are, though.

On the good side: Negotiations, trading; unlike other worker placement games, Archipelago isn't prone to AP. Hidden goals make the whole thing exciting and impredictable. 

EDIT: No, I actually dislike the game a lot more than I first wanted to admit to myself. Dropped the rating by 2. Thinking it over - this IS maybe not the dullest, but still an unexciting worker placement cube pusher.

I'm not sure what to make of Archipelago. On the one hand, it's got some very clever things going on, including an interactive market system, competition for resources, and (when it works) a nifty 'shared burden/shared loss' effect (the crises that various players can choose to help fend off or not).

On the other hand, the auction system is pretty awful, the character cards are very swingy, and there is an overarching fragility to the design that makes me think the game will only work if players play the 'right way'.

Need to play more to see which side of the fence I end up on, but for now this is an impressive effort. Time will tell if the game ends up as glorious or a glorious failure.

Fun exploration game with some worker-placement and coop elements. The winner though is kind of random since you cannot plan a lot in advance and just have to make sure you build everything.

We played two short games of it tonight, four players each time. The first "short" game ran about 3 hours, the second took about 90 minutes. There's some fussiness we had to think/talk through on the first game, but it's by no means "hard." Mostly it's a matter of looking up or thinking through individual card effects. Most of our questions were in fact in the rulebook; the FAQ and the "rules you're getting wrong" threads and the player aids were not necessary.

The goal of the game is to be the smartest player about guessing at what will score and what will end the game. Everyone gets a secret objective card that has both a game-end condition and a scoring condition. There's also a "Trend" card that is public, that anyone can score on. 

Absent that information, the game's economies themselves are mostly divorced from any intrinsic value. Money, as an economy, is universally valuable: It's what buys you the power to set the turn order, it's needed to build some of the scoring assets, and it's how you buy the "Evolution" cards (special bennies that you can trigger without using up your oh-so-valuable action chits). But food economies are mostly there to feed the locals and make money, and materials like stone, wood and iron are there to build up larger assets (towns, markets, ports, churches).

So it's kind of weird, right? Building this economy without any sense, initially, of where the game may be going. Making money isn't hard but it takes people. Making people isn't hard but it takes actions. Getting resources takes people and actions. Building stuff is money and people and a very small investment in goods. Feeding the locals is mostly a matter of banking food, but someone has to be willing to do that. And so on and so forth.

The killer app of the game is the thing it repurposes from Republic of Rome, and that's the "everyone loses" condition: when the angry locals exceed the peaceful colonists, game over, go home, you're dead. The extra twist is that there's a chance that someone at the table will win only if everyone else loses. The traitor thing is very cute, even though we never saw a traitor in either game.

We haven't played nearly enough of this game yet, but in the short game I think it's hard-to-impossible to really suss out each others' secret cards. One big reason is that nearly every endgame condition is someone else's scoring condition. So as you're evaluating someone's play, you have to decide "Hey, is that dude building churches because he gets VPs for having the most churches? Or is he trying to run down the clock because whatever his real goal is, he's beating us all?"

The additional twist to all this is that everyone gets to score on everyone's secret goals. This can be frustrating when someone wanders along and just totally blows you out of the water on your secret, utterly unaware that they've done it. In the second game, I had the "most money" objective, for example: Well duh, dude, everyone is desperate for money! So someone raked in a giant pile and I was aced out of my own secret card.

We're going to try it again next week with the medium-length game, again with four players, and see if the signals percolate to the surface a little more clearly with more time to play. In both cases the game came to a sudden end, and in both cases the winning scores seemed ...arbitrary. We didn't feel like we'd particularly earned a victory or a loss based on good or bad play.

What is certainly true is that the gameplay experience itself is fun. This design space is something I've been working on myself, where the goal of the game's design is to manipulate the social interactions at the table and not just balance spreadsheets or grub together bigger die pools. Exploring is fun, working your economy is fun, second-guessing each other is fun, haggling and deal-brokering is fun. It's all fun! But we're not sure yet if it's satisfying.

RATING: 8
Interesting and engaging game. One common VP race and one secret VP race for each player, where each player scores in each VP race, means no one is quite sure who's in the lead. Just start building and acquiring stuff that other people seem to be building and acquiring. Which sounds easy but isn't because each player's board position makes some things easy re resource acquisition and others hard. There's lots of worker placement avenues so there's not the usual high WP tension ... it's more of a means to your own sandbox end which seems to allow a number of different approaches as to how you acquire resources and money. The natural thing to do is have lots of babies, but you quickly find out that that leads to everyone losing ... as each card-fuelled crisis requires spending resources per people on the board. So there is a collective semi-coop aspect re expanding sensibly, as much as the land can bear I guess, which I don't mind too much because no one knows who's leading so there isn't an aspect of I'm losing therefore I'll kill the game off. It's a level removed, and it helps govern a bigger picture. It's done nicely. The game feels like it might play differently each time, and it's not round-bound, which are two big pluses in my Euro book, so I'm happy exploring this further.

Based on one play: We played a short scenario, which simply causes the game to end earlier, but the game play remains the same.  It is a mix of land exploration, resource management and worker placement. The artwork is amazing, the game is very inviting, however there is a lot going on, especially just from having the rules read to you. But like most worker placements, lots of options but not as complicated as you may originally think (for regular gamers). Would like to play again.

If you ever felt like worker placement games such as Stone Age felt a little superficial than this game is for you.

There's so many things you can do and everything feels so intergrated that it's hard not to have a good time playing this game. Easily one of my favourites.

Really beautiful yes extremely foggy in terms of what I should actually be doing. I didn't really feel engaged and I'm not sure how well the semi co-op works in this game. Also, the points seem to be incredibly hard to get and it looks like points come down to barely breaking double digits. I'd play it again to see where I sit, but to me Christophe Boelinger seems to be such a hit or miss designer for me.

An excellent semi-cooperative 3X game, which is very thematic for a euro. I like that you're exploring the new world, harvesting resources and pursuing the trend of the game (i.e., victory points), while at the same time you're trying to deduce the secret objectives of your opponents and protect the Archipelago from a potential Separatist among our midst.

Like others have said this is a gamers game. It is difficult to explain the game to others and takes time to do so. The most complex game I've played since Earth Reborn.

1st game will have everyone fumbling around trying to figure out how to play and what to do. It doesn't help that there is some confusion in the interpretation of the rules. 

By the time the 1st game gets near the end, the game will begin to come together and make sense. I found it an interesting and fun game. I actually didn't want it to end when it did and we played for 3hours. We played a 5 player game and two of us liked it, one reserved judgement till they could read through the rules themselves and the other two would rather commit ritual suicide then play again. The two that didn't like the game found it too long and overly complex for what it is.

It just doesn't seem possible to grasp the game in one session. This is a game that needs to be played a few times for it to click. Unfortunately most people won't make that kind of investment so this is a game that will be hard to get to the table. I hope people will give this game a chance.

I'm trying to figure out how to explain this game to others without boring them to tears. It might be best to show an example round or two so they can visually see it working. This game is in desperate need of a summary and player aids.

I hope I can get my wife to play the game, but I think she would be overwhelmed by the numerous choices and the initial ambiguity in formulating what to do next. 

I don't think this game is getting played again at my FLGS unfortunately as it didn't go over well with the Alpha players. Not sure if I will keep the game or not. It's a good game but it's polarizing and there is no point keeping a game no one will play.


edit: returned this one back to the store. While I liked it the pain threshold for learning this game is high. It's also difficult to teach without having everyone's eyes glaze over. It requires some dedication and investment by the players, and honestly I'm not sure the game needed to be this way to accomplish what it set out to do. 

Also there is no point in keeping the game if no one is going to play it with you. If the one person who still has their copy at my flgs game nights wants to play two or three player then I'll get my fix from him. I may pick the game up again when the expansion is available. The game should have included the solo rules rather then making people have to purchase an expansion to get them.

Probably my favorite game aside from Pandemic Legacy.  I love building the world with tile laying.  I love the semi-cooperative nature of the game that forces you to help and receive help from your opponents.  I adore the hidden victory conditions component.  I don't struggle with the black meeple as some complain about because it is not just a representation of native unrest but also of homeland countrymen's unrest.  There is just so much going on in this game that prioritizing and trying to minimize negative consequences of intentionally ignored actions is foundational to being successful.

I’ve been wanting to try this for quite a while now, and I’m happy to report that I love it. I’ve described it as a sandbox game, where players have a huge number of choices and the best path forward isn’t always clear. This is something I tend to enjoy quite a bit in games. Archipelago has a lot of unknown elements - players only know two of the conditions that will score points at the end of the game, and must attempt to deduce the others by watching his opponents. The modular hex board starts very small, but quickly expands via exploration. Because the resources and land/sea configuration of new tiles are either partially or completely unknown, players must balance the need to explore with the uncertainty of success. 

The game has not one, but two resources markets that players can use to buy and sell goods at fluctuating prices. Players can build building and acquire cards that grant special abilities. There is just so much about this game that is clever. It’s commonly called semi-cooperative, but I think that does the game a disservice. There are some truly mean things players can do in the game. I think Archipelago is better described as a competitive game in which everyone can lose. 

So far, I’ve only played the short game, but there is still quite a bit to explore there. I think this is a keeper for now.

A very frustrating but pretty game. It has a very cool engine, but the crises are so frequent that whatever you're constructing becomes stymied all too often. The constant dealing with crises and throwing your hard-earned commodities away because you're the one who happened to produce that commodity that turn just gets tedious. Then throw in the victory condition one player frequently has of helping the natives revolt and it makes the conclusion pre-determined. The game should be more fun than this, but it's not only not fun, it's like working at a crappy job where no one appreciates you. Reminds me of Gloria Mundi, where all improvements and build-ups are destroyed every couple turns. Not a fan.

Well, let me start by congratulating all those who struggled through the rulebook, it's far from obvious to get it all from 1 lecture. This is a hard game to explain also as there are quite a lot of rules.

Our first game ended prematurely after only 2 rounds, making me win as I had the separatist. I understand why the card is in it (otherwise people who have the feeling they can't win anymore, can make everybody lose), but I can also understand why people would exclude it from gameplay.

The game itself has some interesting (new) mechanics. The everybody loses if there would be more revolutionaries as inhabitants is 1 of them (after CO2 this is the 2nd 2012 Essen-release that has a 'you-can-all-lose' - mechanic without being a coöperative game) and I also liked what they did with the insert(s) to keep information hidden.

Nice artwork also, only the huts that give a surplus of workers could have been clearer (or at least bigger :s).

This game has a lot of stuff going on for it, so teaching it takes some preparation. However, once you start playing all the actions make perfect sense. There is a good deal of unknowns, so it does combine two things I really like: Good planning and engine building along with uncertainty. Diverse and shared scoring conditions make thins super interesting. Variable powers. Really good.
My only concern with the game is that I am not quite sure how this would work with two, which is my usual target.

Initially gave it a 9/10 but afterwards lowered it to 7. Why? While in theory this is an awesome game, in practice it happens way to often that everybody loses. Even without the Rebel goal. With our group of players we haven't found an effective strategy of play. There's always someone who prefers an all-around loss rather than a 2nd place.

The game has a very good balance between the individual game and the coop game. It's a lot of fun, you can really feel the theme and it has a high replay value. I highly recommend this game.

It is not a game for highly competitive matches, as the system is not tight that way. 
The rules can require two passes to fully understand, but even if you get a few wrong during your first match it'll still be fun, and once you have one person who understands the rules well enough it's easy (but a little long) to explain them to new players.

The rebellion marker has not been as much an issue as I would've liked so far but I only played the shorter games for now. 

Although it says 2 to 5 players, I'd say the sweet-spot is 3 to 4 players (4 being a little better). The 2 player rules is basically each player controlling 2 players, so it ends up being a 4 player match with 2 players.

[b]Comment:[/b] Really nice look, really strong mechanics, but sort of a dud in terms of payoff if no player happens to be the traitor. There are very few points in the game in general. In the first game we played the highest scoring player had 7. The end seemed to arrive suddenly since everyone gets an endgame card with different requirements. I find myself wondering how the game would play if we seeded the deck with the traitor... Perhaps none of us were playing aggressively enough. I'm really not sure.

RATING: 5
Update: Raised from 3 to 5. Played another time, short game, three players.

We intentionally removed the "traitor" goal from the game. We also had a much better understanding of how all players can lose.

I think this game suffers in BGG ratings because it will undoubtedly give a very bad first impression. The short game will end too abruptly for most players, or the rebels will win without players noticing. Although the game itself is straightforward, there is *a lot* of chrome added to it.

Also, I think this game shines only if all players know all the possible winning conditions. They are all printed in the rules so that players can refer to them; it would have been much better if this list was available to all players as a player aid.

Still, I'm not sure if I would want to play the medium-length game. I didn't find the game itself that compelling -- it's often frustrating because the game restricts players from doing what they want to do.

=====

The reviews for this game don't reflect how simple this game is. Place hexagon tiles to create a map, move dudes on them, produce resources, sell them, build buildings on them, purchase new dudes or let them reproduce. All of these give VPs. The trick here is that only some of them count towards winning. And players don't know what all of them are.

As for the semi-cooperative part: I like this mechanic in general in which players have to divide their resources between solving a puzzle cooperatively or getting VPs. Players who are not in the lead have to coerce those who are to put more effort into the puzzle (and less into themselves), which should help balance the game. 

Unfortunately, it feels like a typical Euro, a genre of which I'm not really a fan: Multiple, yet limited and uninteresting paths to victory and way, way, way too fiddly for what it is. In addition, I didn't find this cooperative puzzle -- to prevent a rebellion -- that compelling. 

In the only game I played, I believe we didn't fully understand what was required from all players to prevent the game from winning.

Gorgeous art on the hexagonal map tiles.

I'm a fan of the designer and heard great things about the game.  The gameplay and how great the structure is cannot be understated.  But the scoring?  I hate it.  It's too long to not have anything to really aim at.  The gameplay is good enough that I would play with some variants that someone strongly recommended...but this one really made me sad as it should have been a great game.

Massive and complex, yet the core of what you'll actually want to do with your turn is oddly focused and straightforward.

Are you the separatist? No? That's what the separatist would say, you dirty separatist. You took slavery? Separatist!

Archipelago is a very interesting game, but it's extremely unwieldy. There are many moving parts and the game feels like a delicate balancing act, it's a co-op, yeah, but it's also competitive. Sometimes you should make sacrifices of your precious resources, but hey, you don't have to! But if you don't and unhappiness gets out of control everyone loses! (Except that rat bastard the separatist). The game also features hidden objectives and game end triggers (each player has one, only he knows what his is). It's kind of nuts, but it's very fun (and sometimes frustrating) to play.

It is such a huge hurdle finding a group of gamers who appreciate the delicate semi-cooperative balance in Archipelago. The island resources and the angry natives are in a constant state of flux, and each player is secretly hoarding something, meanwhile, worrying about the need to hoard everything else just in case it's someone elses secret goal.

We played with the idea that is better to make deals and call in favors than play as violent explorers. There's plenty of island to go around, and try to remember that 4th place is still better than being murdered by natives. With like-minded gamers you're bound to find a unique, challenging, and rewarding experience.

I won't rate this as I've only played it once, as a five-player game. I imagine I'd end up giving it a 5.

I won, more by luck than judgement, but didn't really enjoy it.

The game does have some nice interrelating elements and knock-on effects, with actions causing ratios to change or otherwise adding/reducing pressure elsewhere. So if you like the idea of a 'Rube Goldberg machine' then you might love this. There is plenty to think about and plenty of options, if you can be bothered to navigate the fog of moving cubes, hidden goals, random events etc.

My biggest problem is its slow crawl of buying/selling cubes, watching closely who's acquiring what cubes, checking various scales to try to buy things before they become more expensive etc. It means that playing the game 'seriously' would be like monitoring 20 CCTV screens at once ... just to gain a small advantage amid all the randomness. Personally, I like to see more exciting/reliable results if I put that much effort into a game.

There are some awkward mechanisms:
- End-of-turn objectives that are hard to plan for because they can randomly change.
- Sudden endgame triggers/conditions that undermine your ability to 'pace' your strategy.
- The anticlimactic ability to intentionally trigger an 'everyone loses' ending, without huge difficulty, if you're behind and don't want others to win.
- Too much hidden information to get a good/fun sense of whether your actions are affecting other players much.
- Negotiation is massively open-ended and can be done as much as you like, but it slows the game to a snail's pace.
- Etc.

Overall, I can't be bothered with this much laborious squinting.

Archipelago at first seems like a very solid Euro game with excellent mechanics that fit very well to the theme: you explore the islands, gather resources, trade them in for money, increase your population, build buildings, receive  taxes. In all your actions you have to watch out that you do not increase the global revolution level too much, or everybody loses. At the beginning of each round there is some crisis in which the players have to pay some resources to avert it.

Every player receives secretly a game ending condition (e.g. number of certain buildings build) and victory point conditions. The game ends, when one condition is met and then each player gets victory points according to ALL players' VP condition. 

In general I like the game since the mechanics are really excellent and make thematic sense. Furthermore the board (tiles) and components are beautiful. But I have some issues with a few aspects. Blind bidding for turn-order with winner-takes-it-all and everyone loses his bet is just not fun; being first actually matters quite a bit, especially for the crisises. I actually do not have a big problem with the semi-cooperative aspect; we play with VP awarded for goods donated during crisis, so most of the time it is rational to donate. My biggest complain is the  hidden ending and VP conditions. Two of my games were over too abruptly, when you just got going (even for a "medium" length condition). There are so few VP awarded and you can score by luck VP by your opponent's condition, such that there is a rather big luck component in determining the winner. Probably it would be better to have a sheet with all ending conditions, such that you actively avoid any of these to keep the game going. But this would be so unthematic and gamey that I do not want to take this effort.

[i]Update:[/i] Rating decreased from 7 to 6

While playing the game is a lot of fun, in 4 plays I have never seen a satisfying ending. Either the end came unexpected when you got going or we stopped the game since no end condition was near to be met. With all those hidden objectives the game has almost no direction and in the end you may be lucky to score a 2nd place in an objective only known to one of your opponents. I would rate the gameplay 7 or even higher, but the ending and scoring always falls flat for me.

Take that diplomacy type game disguised as civilization / exploration. 

AP prone should avoid. Hidden victory conditions don't make it a better game. Resources and money can go out of circulation before a game end mechanism has not been met. Game rewards informal negotiations and back stabbing both of which are not in the games mechanics. Only a few character cards allow direct actions against other players, so not everyone will have to ability to retaliate, which leaves everyone else at a big disadvantage and at the mercy of the fortunate player. So, there is really no defense and really makes any longer term planning a waste of effort.

Three player is not a very exciting game since all of the victory point rewards have 1st, 2nd, and 3rd and tied place also get points. Four player is almost as bad as three. Seems to play best with five.

Seems too long and too much work for the "fun".Have played four games and they experience got worse with every game - not interested in playing any more. A better choice is Glen Drover Age of Empires or Martin Wallace's Struggle of Empires.

RATING: 7.8
7.5 after 1 play. There is certainly a lot going on, which meant we had to work as a team to stop us loosing to revolt. Personally feel the revolt card is unbalanced due to this. We did not use this card and glad we didn't. Player objectives quickly took 2nd place to the crisis cards appearing. Would like to play again, however, couldn't initially suggest what i would or could do different.  
Not had a chance to play again myself, but feedback has been that revolt card is not as bad as I thought.

After 3rd play, this has begun to grow on me.  It certainly has hidden depths and your gaming group will also change the game perceptions as bidding is a key element.  Changing rating to a 7.8 for now.

RATING: 6.8
(+) Beautifully produced game (except for the coins which are too small)

(+) Theme nicely integrated in gameplay

(+) Plenty of opportunities for negotiation. Interesting player interaction.

(+) The game often offers interesting decision making for each player individually or for the entire group. This could well be the main feature of this game.

(-) Combination of secret goals with secret end conditions brings a certain level of chaos into the game

(-) Point scoring opportunities are very limited. After playing for a long time victory or defeat could depend on an (unknown) detail.

(-) Player interaction in this semi-cooperative game is somewhat twisted: Players must work together to avoid a scenario in which all lose, but the player who contributes the least to this efford has the best chance of winning. This is actually a problem, because doing a real efford in order to avoid a collective loss will in many cases also cost you your personal victory. In a semi-cooperative game I prefer a game which does a better job in creating win-win opportunities.

(-) The secret end conditions can be a bit unfair: some players will have greater control over when to end the game compared to others. Moreover, these conditions make the game time highly unpredictable which is rather impractical

(-) Some not very elegant rules dealing with trade actions, buildings, employability of workers, ... which makes explaining/understanding the game harder and which makes pauzing a thematic game to search for game rules in the manual a recurring pain

(-) Some ameritrash-elements are mixed up in a game which revolves around euro-style mechanics. For some this is sure to be a feature, but in this game, I take this as a disappointment. There is luck of the draw in goal cards, exploration tiles, demand cards and luck is also induced by some character/technology cards.

Approx game time: unknown. Depends on goal cards. The game offers a different card set if you want to play a long, longer or ultra long game.

The true replacement for Catan! That being said, it's a massive design with a lot of corresponding systems and opportunities for the players.

I will agree with others and say that the rulebook is lacking in some parts, and the scoring at the end of the game is a bit of a toss up, but I play games to play games... Not just to win. That being said, I have a lot of fun playing this game and negotiating with others. There are so many cool mechanics at work. You gotta play the medium or long game to really play this game! The short game doesn't offer enough variety.

This game is very good. Worker placement/exploration/resource management. It also has a bit of a coop feel because you are all trying to keep the colony alive, but you are also trying to work against each other to win the game. The most interesting part of this game for me is that everyone has secret end game conditions and secret victory point conditions that everyone scores from. It is a blast. It's a lot, but a great game.

One of my favorite games I own. Even though the game has a lot of moving parts and the games can swing fist at you. It still works very well and still there is no other game like it that I have played. The only this that is keeping this game from being a 10 in my book and my game group is one of the hidden goal player get and that is the traitor goal. They should of made it a little harder for the traitor to win because it is to easy to win with him. They should have made him have a couple of things he needs to do to win and not just the simple way they allow him to win.

I'm still on the fence about the secret winning conditions since the very concept forces you to play in the dark for most of the game especially if, like me, it's your first time playing. However, the actual mechanics can be quite  rewarding and the game does a nice job balancing the need for exploration with resource management and even some light negotiation. Convoluted at first, but likely to become more intuitive and enjoyable with time.

Very good game, it's euro with theme. Semi-cooperative with heavy interaction between players with negotiations mechanism. If you are person that likes games where everything depends on you and your final score, this game is not for you than. Constantly, you need to make attempts to put yourself in better position through negotiations with other players and together with others keep balance on archipelago to keep people working, busy and not revolting, because if they revolt You all lose (or not :))

I'll give Archipelago this much: I've never played anything else quite like it. A heavy Euro that resists optimization or even clear goals. A trading/colonization game that pushes for theme and experience above all else. It feels like something that the designer made for himself as much as anything else, which is an admirable quality. I suppose my rating could go in either direction, but at this point it's a promising unique experience.

Nice little traitor game on a euro base: but I'm not sure it's adequately dealt with the free-rider problem. By having the 'lose' condition open and fixed, it makes it very easy for players to lie back and let others deal with the problem. 

Not bad, by any means, but after my first couple of plays it always paid to pretend to be the savage and hope he wasn't in the game proper.

Podcast recently described 'My Village' as being a 'sandbox game' - which seems to stretch the term to the absolute limit, but I wonder whether that might almost apply here? A lot of interesting choices, but it feels to me as though the gameplay, particularly as far as being able to work strategically towards a win, is a bit lost in the mix. A colourful mess, that might appeal.

RATING: 7
The rebellion, negotiation and breaking of deals all appeal to me, but they wouldn't go down well in certain gaming groups. A lovely game to get caught up in the theme where you need to be observing the subtle moves of your opponents. Will not appeal to those who prefer their well laid plans to be smoothly executed. Nice art. Plays a little long for my taste, although you need to play at least the medium game to get a true feel for it. The rules just feel a little cluttered. Or maybe it's the graphics and how squished everything feels. At any rate, it's got some good ideas all mixed together in a lovely package, but I'm just not feeling like the fun to effort ratio is working for me.

A mix between worker placement and Clue, where you try to run and exploit a rich and fertile archipelago together with your semi-co players. 

It has loads of different mechanics, and it can be a bit of a pain in the ass to get it all started up, but once you manage that initial hurdle, it runs like a charm and everything interacts with each other. Every mechanic (markets, population happiness and control over population) influences another, and your action can influence them as well.

The real trick of the game is that every player has a different set of end-game conditions, interests and goals which will remain hidden for the entire game. 
Because everybody has different (and in most cases conflicting) win conditions, the game will quickly turn into a game of (broken) promises, backstabbing and exploiting. 

But... (yes, big but!) 
if you only keep your own goals in mind, you'll quickly find out that the indigenous population isn't all too happy with their new exploitive masters, and you'll soon have a rebellion on your hands, which means all players lose the game (except if the rebellion was all according to your insidious plan because staging a rebellion was your win-condition).

If you want to run this game to the end, you and your semi-co players will have to find a balance between exploitation, investment, collaboration, backstabbing and your own interests.

I am utterly confused about this one. What those who like the game tell me doesn't connect with my experience at all. 

So, maybe it was that the explanation of the game bored the hell out of me. It's a thematic euro with ameritrash level of details and complexity. Which makes the theme more fleshed out, but unfortunately it's one of those themes I couldn't care less about. It's about micro managing your empire/colony/whatever and the level of detail is ridiculous, so if you're that weird niche who like both theme and optimisation games - this is the one to get. 

And then the whole groupthink level which I'm not convinced it works. Ok, it works with some groups, I see it falling apart by other groups (like mine). Ok, so you're focused on your little imperialistic enterprise, trying to gather stuff, to build stuff, to sell stuff, to buy some other stuff and some more stuff. But, somehow your focus must shift and realise this is a co-op. Of sorts. You see, either everybody loses or everybody wins, but somebody wins more than the others. Got that? There's more: somehow an idea that if everybody loses there's a chance somebody wins regardless (one of the hidden goals is helping the native uprising) is supposed to make people work together??? 

Anyhow my game went like this: 1 hour of explanation, 30 minutes of game where nobody helped anybody and my goals appeared unreachable and my situation dire, so I said screw you people, I'm not saving your asses. And we all lost the very next turn. The main problem was that with all the micromanaging and empire building, the group I played with completely ignored the idea of working together and bypassed the notion of "winning together". 

So my observation is: this needs a specific group of people who are either so competitive or so friendly or a bit of both in order to make the game work. For me while this seems like an interesting idea, the accounting core of the game holds no interest for me and I'm more than happy to throw spanner in the works and finish the game early. Also the solipsistic level of gaming is for me at ods with the cooperative vibe (or even semi-cooperative vibe). The rating does not reflect quality of the game, just my level of interest. And overburdened overambitious design, doesn't help it.  I'd be interested to see a game with this dynamic and 1/20 of the rules. And a more unique theme.

While I enjoy the base game and its mechanics, a lot about this game leave me feeling unfulfilled. 

It feels like you are just mass gathering resources and hoping that nobody ends the game. I feel as if I am just wandering through the game with no real goal in mind, despite having a card that actually tells me what my goal is.

The artwork is beautiful, the exploration system is pretty fun, but the game feels clumsy and aimless when playing. I am still a fan, because I do like the core gameplay, but a lot about it just feels like it could have been more then it is.

Some very interesting unique mechanisms here.  Especially the interplay between the job market and population discontent.  The "semi-cooperative" aspect is interesting too, especially since there is more than a fair share of opportunity for conflict (which is a bit shocking for a Euro game).

However, the hidden victory AND endgame conditions just don't sit well with me.   I have only played the short variant.  Maybe in a long variant, the problems with this are mitigated, but I could see it being even worse:  you play four hours only to determine the winner through virtual randomness.  Maybe I just need to relax and realize that the victory outcome is not the point of the game.

The idea of this game is amazing. It's so fun, and there are some secret end of game bonuses!

Féltem ettől a fél-koop játéktól és úgy tűnik nem véletlenül. Már a Red November sem tetszett amiatt, hogy van olyan eset, hogy mindenki veszít mégis nyerhet egy valaki. Sajnos ebben a játékban is van ilyen, sőt egyértelműen a legkönnyebb az ezt a célkártyát húzó játékos dolga. Sokat elmond a játékról, hogy sokan enélkül a célkártya nélkül játsszák a játékot. Minden játékos kap egy titkos célt, illetve van egy mindenki számára látható közös is. Ez teljesen jó. Felfedezők vagyunk az új kontinensen és kezdetben közösen küzdünk a helyi őslakosság fellázadása ellen. 6 féle nyersanyagot termelünk, amit az ottani vagy európai piacon tudunk értékesíteni. Felfedezünk, különböző épületeket emelünk és kártyákat vásárolunk, ami adott dolgokban ad előnyöket. Nem tetszett a felfedezés szerencsefaktora. Ha nem tud az ember új hexát lerakni, akkor veszett az akciója, semmi kompenzációja nincs. Érdekes a feljövő kártyák szerencsefaktora is. Összesen 5-6 kártya lehet az 50 körüliből, ami pontot adhat a játék végén. Mivel kevés pont van ezek a kártyák rettentő értékesek lehetnek és sokszor a szerencsén múlik ki veheti meg őket. A kártyák ármechanizmusa viszont teljesen jó ötlet, forgatásukkal változik az áruk. Tetszett a piacműködés, de az persze egyáltalán nem új ötlet. A célkártyák végfeltételei is elég kiegyenlítetlenek, van amire nagyon kicsi az esély, van amit akár egy játékos is jó eséllyel próbálhat befolyásolni. Beleraktak licitáló részt is a játékba. A legtöbbet licitáló dönti el az összes játékos sorrendjét az adott fordulóban. Tehát elképzelhető, hogy a második legtöbbet beadó játékot 5. lesz egy ötfős partiban. Ezen elég sok minden múlhat. A játéknak azonnal vége, ha teljesül egy végefeltétel, nem kell egy teljes körnek lemennie, így előfordulhat, hogy 1-2 játékos nem ugyanannyi kört játszik, igazságtalan szerintem. Érdekes játék lett az Archipelago. Mindent össze akartak gyúrni, nagyon a témaközpontúságra mentek, de ennek a játékmenet látja kárát. Nekem az alapkoncepció fél-kooperatív jellege sem tetszik, mert véleményem szerint ritkán lehet esély arra, hogy mindenkinek érdeke legyen a továbbjáték és ne a mindenki vesszen felé húzzon valaki, ha nem jól áll. A szerencsefaktorok is a téma miatt kerültek bele, de nem biztos, hogy ez jót tesz a játéknak. Úgy érzem sok kisebb nagyobb hibát követtek el a készítők, pedig lehetett volna ebből egy nagyon jó játék is. Így sajnos nekem átlag alatti lett.

I can appreciate that there is a game there but I detest the "everyone wins but someone is the best winner" rule as I consider that to be 1 winner and everyone else loses. I also strongly dislike the negotiation side of the game which means that crashing the game is all to often the best strategy to avoid losing to the real players.
 I now realise that if you play this game to win then the most important strategy is the negotiation to stop someone tanking the game which is an element that I strongly dislike as it is open to abuse with friends just helping each other (kingmaking).

It has been a very long time since I have been this excited about a Euro style game.

There are too many elements to this game that should not have made it out of the Euro clean rooms - too many little boxes on the checklist of perceived negatives that were missed. This game somehow escaped its Euro upbringing with its soul intact.

Nearly every element is Euro to be sure, but it wants to do its own thing with those elements.

There seems to be a whole bunch of variants and suggestions proposed to "fix" this game. People feel the need to herd this beast back to their comfort zones where everything is safe and sound.

Quit it.

There are already, oh, about a zillion other perfectly comfortable Euros to choose from. No need to bring in the sanitizers and scrub away the Scary Things. Had this game been safe and comfortable, I wouldn't have given it a second thought. 

The game is beautiful. The exploration aspect is fun and all the parts come together to create a very different game with each playing.

I really appreciate the way the partial/hidden victory points are implemented, as well as the game ending conditions. If you are having trouble with this aspect, approach it like this (and teach it like this):

1 You always know two victory objectives - the evolution card (known to all) and your personal secret objective. Work toward these points.

2 Stay balanced. If you build a little of everything, instead of just focusing on one or two objectives, you have a better shot at making it into more scoring positions.

3 Stay flexible and aware. Figure out what others are doing. React quickly. Why did she build a second port? She didn’t really need a second - Oh.

This is all easier said than done, but this type of gameplay is a blast. It keeps you engaged, and the process is fun.

"Any man's death diminishes us, but when an artist passes away, we lose not just an island but an entire archipelago."

Man i'm in love with this game. There are a lot of things i should despise: a little bit of randomness, negotiation, ... but i love it.
Maybe it is just that sense of exploration, discovering the unknown, the uncertainty of the end game, i don't really know. As of right now, in my Top 5 for sure.

RATING: 6.5
Truly not very good. It is quite beautiful and the interactions are interesting, although I think that the cooperative aspect of the game is not emphasized much in the rules. I think the co-op nature of the game also scripts it far too much and reduces the possible actions that you can make, eliminating the possibility of having lots of decisions.

UPDATE: Got this to the table again last night. Without the traitor and adding the benefactor, the game is much more interesting. Still, it seems that the game plays a bit slowly to generate interesting decisions at a rapid enough pace to get myself interested.

UPDATE #2: I think it has reached the top of its upside, as I still don't think that you get enough of a chance to build up your engine and the game moves kinda slowly. I do think that commonly shown objectives is a must.

1 play, 4er

Wow, this is a pretty cool game! It's a mix of exploration, worker placement and area majority (sort of) with public and secret objectives and negotiation. It may turn out that there's too much negotiation for me, but I still look forward to playing this one again!

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
For setup, players will create a map of hexes and place their starting tokens (boats, meeples). Hexes show different layouts of land and water; water shows some number of fish icons, while land shows x (0-5) resource icons (several types in the game) and 5-x huts. As they're placed, advance 1 space/hut on the Surplus Worker track. The domestic and export market boards are also placed in display, with several goods seeded to the domestic market. Another board tracks the total number of meeples on the map. Five Evolution Cards are placed on display (rest are in face up deck). Players each get a secret objective card, while one is put on display. The secret cards each have a game-end condition, 

Each round:
1. Untap all your used cards and reset all meeples.
2. Blind bid for turn order; winner sets everyone's order. Tied players rebid (if tied again, no one wins). ALL bids are spent.
3. Resolve boards 1-4, which may result in moving the rebellion or Surplus Worker markers.
4. Balance of the Archipelago: resolve the event/crisis on top of the Evolution deck. 
- top half = domestic crisis; lay all meeples down, then in turn order players spend resources to stand up meeples at ratio on card (may freely take from domestic market if desired); any meeples still down add one each to rebellion marker
- bottom half = export crisis; in turn order, pay resources from export market or personal supply; advance rebellion marker once per missing resource
5. Actions. On your turn, in any order:
- use a worker to take an action (harvest resources, build/use buildings, move meeples, explore, breed, hire worker, tax = earn 1 coin/worker, or conduct 1 transaction in domestic or export market)
... explore: take top tile of stack, or discard it and use the next one; they're double-sided, and are placed such that one of your tokens could get there; if successful, get an explorer token (which are in stacks; everyone gets extra workers when 1st and 2nd stacks are depleted)
... move: move 1 hex, although may move over chains of boats
... harvest: move your available meeples to icons on their hexes, all of one type; collect 1 cube each
... build: each has a different cost, and is placed in hex; place meeple building it on top. Buildings (4 types) allow access to markets, or stand up all meeples on tile during rebellion, or give you control of all buildings and resource icons on the hex)
... breed: every pair creates a third; max 3 meeples/player/hex (token-limited)
... hire: take workers from trained natives board, reducing count as you do so
- use an Evolution card you've previously purchased
- pay 1 coin to use a market or port building (to conduct 2 transactions at domestic or export markets)
6. Evolution Cards. In turn order, buy a card and rotate another, or rotate 2 cards. The card prices change with each rotation, until they are discarded. At end of turn, replenish display; if red zone revealed on card at top of deck, resolve it immediately. 

During actions:
- if rebellion marker ever exceeds population marker, everyone loses (unless someone's secret card is the Traitor)!
- if any player's secret end-game condition is met, they must announce it; game ends at end of current player's turn. Then, everyone reveals their objective cards and everyone scores points for them and for the public objective. Also score VP for any Wonders (some Evolution cards) built. The player with the most VP wins!

RATING: 6
I want so bad to love this game, but there are some huge barriers preventing that.

There's so much to love with this game.  The design of the exploration mechanic is well-done and entertaining, there's variety in the "special power" cards offered up each turn, there's depth in the worker placement wheel and it's interaction with the game map, hidden goals (a favorite mechanic of mine) that scores everyone a la Troyes, and the resource economy is balanced and well-implemented in the entire game.  I even like the unemployment/savage mechanic and how it's implemented into the game.

What I don't like are the consequences and effects of that mechanic.  Mainly that if the number of savages gets too high the game is over for all players and how much and how often players control the number of savages.  Many of the actions raise the unemployment/savage numbers and each turn one or more crises happen that players need to give up resources to resolve.  The problem with this "semi-cooperative" mechanic is that players who have resigned to losing (or just plain assholes) can end the game for everyone out of spite.  Exacerbating this is the fact that one of the hidden goals wins the game for only that player if this happens.

If the revolt only caused a global punishment (not global game loss) this game might be one of my favorites.  I still actually really like it in spite of its weaknesses but I just can't love it, especially due to the amount of time and effort this game requires be invested that can just become completely unraveled.

RATING: 4
It looks like a game I would really like, but reports are that it is long, fiddly, and with lots of rules clarifications that just do not make it worth the effort.
Now having played it, it is full of No. The turn order bidding/assignment? No. The randomness of losing your turn when an explore does not match? No. The power of the ability I got (Slavery) was broken, and probably needs a house rule. No. This game is not for me.
The tile art is gorgeous. I really wish I could like the game as I want the art!

RATING: N/A
I honnestly didn't understand the game very well, I think. There are some rules that are fiddly and some mechanisms don't seem to work on some groups of players, like mines for example (bidding for turn order with negotiation).
The idea of finishing the game presenting several ways to do it is cool but also maybe too much random and uncontroled. Plus, the goals that each player have on these cards are too much unrelated to each other and at some point you don't have a narrative and a structure that helps you to understand what's supposed for you to do.
One seems to play and cut losses, get money but, when you try to get a good card that should help you, a lot of times this card doesn't exist or simply isn't interesting enough.
The growth of the population, the unrest, the available working class with the increase and decrease of costs are all very cool ideas but also all very clumsy to implement or to remember. In theory this game would be so much better than it is actually, in my opinion.

RATING: 7
This game is fascinating. It survives on players engaging with the semi-cooperative and negotiation parts of the game, but plays like so many other resource conversion, WP style Euro games. In that it reminds me of Colonial - the game works if the players engage and embrace the design philosophy - if they sit back and play it like an economic efficiency game it won't.  So I salute the design intention and I hope it works.

Only played one short learning game to get the rules down, one medium length and one short. It feels like it does work, though I think players need to be equally experienced as the learning curve, escpecially sussingbthe out what other players victory conditions and end game conditions are.

This is a tentative rating. I liked a lot of what I saw (the economy, engine-building and exploration were all very interesting). But I'm still not sure how I feel about the secret goals or semi-cooperative portions. In the one 3-player game I played, both the separatist and pacifist were in play, reducing the impact of those two elements.

Sprawling semi-cooperative civilization (?) game chock full of resource gathering, exploration and so on. What makes it exciting is that various factors raise the number of unhappy natives; and if the number of rebels gets too high, all players are executed and lose. If the crisis is kept at bay long enough, players win and a "grand winner" is chosen.

My one-sentence elevator pitch is, I think, "Traders of Genoa with consequences." It's a negotiation game. Players have their own engine-building and their own targets for points, but the threat of disaster is constantly looming. Negotiation isn't limited to the crises, of course -- perhaps you want to pay to harvest resources in a territory another player controls, or trade for mutual benefit -- but that's where it comes to the fore. 

The rebellion is too much for any one player to avert alone, but do you want to give up [i]your[/i] resources for the good of all? How much will you pay to get someone else to contribute?

It's spectacular and chaotic, a rollercoaster of unpredictable and uncontrollable crises. Maybe with experience I will be able to deduce other players' scoring cards, maybe not, and I'm not sure I will ever be comfortable with the lack of control, especially given the possible length of the game. But it sure is an interesting experience: a glorious, intriguing mess.

Extremely unimpressed with this design.  The competitve co-op breaks the game if you don't play it like an RPG or something, and the turn order bidding is idiotic.  Huge luck of the draw in exploration, too, in a game that's 9 million hours long.  Art is beautiful but not always functional.

Good theme play.  Game will take a few plays to pick up the rules and strategies as there is a lot going on.  The components are very good - colorful thick modular board, wood playing pieces and somewhat durable cards.  The colors for the resources were not coordinated between components and cause confusion.  The semi-cooperative mechanic does not seem to work well.  Game length is somewhat long.

A Gamer's Game as good as you might have wished for. Not easy to master, despite simple rules. It's about the way the different mechanism interact.
Don't fear the negotiation part (it's very much depending on your personal style - if you don't like it, just don't do it) and don't fear the semi-coop-part, it's in most cases in your personal interest to act for the "greater good". Plus, there's an optional rule rewarding beneficial play, just put that rule in place and you're good.

A fairly heavy euro, but everything makes sense. Iron seems a bit underutilized, but apparently this is fixed in the War & Peace expansion.

Has a few potentially polarizing elements, including negotiations, hidden victory conditions, and semi-coop in nature. But the sum here far exceeds the individual parts.

Should have a ton of replayability, too. Artwork is very appealing, and overall is very well executed.

Only flaw is that the rulebook should have been clearer on some key points.

RATING: 5
This game is very difficult for me to rate... while I do find the game enjoyable and there are a lot of interesting decisions and mechanisms involved... the game feels like it is just fundamentally flawed.

The whole "build up but not too much or you all lose" just goes against everything that the game presents. You want to do well and expand and build a lot, but if you do it pushes the natives to too fast to handle and kills you. Too many people have to "bite the bullet" so everyone doesn't lose. This is even more compounded if a player gets the traitor card and just constantly taxes and goes for a native win. Ultimately the person who decides not to "bite the bullet" the most will win.

Also, the game is fairly random in what exploration tiles you get in relation to what the VP cards are. The VP cards feel most balanced around a long game with very experienced players, but you'd have to play this game dozens and dozens of times to get to that level.

So difficult to rate a game like this. There's a lot to like but a few ideas that just destroy it all. Feels like it would be better as a full co-op where everyone scores VP equal to the lowest player so everyone is working together. Not sure if there is really an easy fix or if the game is just flawed to the core.

RATING: 10
Truly outstanding semi-cooperative exploration and civilisation game. Players take the roll of colonising powers on an imaginary island group and have a wealth of actions available to them each turn. These include exploring new parts of the archipelago (thereby increasing the size of the modular game board), harvesting resources, selling to local and foreign markets, constructing buildings, and many more. The cooperative aspect comes into play as players have to maintain a 'balance' to the area by keeping the natives happy through avoiding over-taxation and not introducing too much foreign labour, and being able to supply enough resources to both types of market. Each player has their own secret end of game objective for scoring, as well as an end of game condition, which is a clever aspect of the gameplay as it means that no-one is quite sure when the game is likely to end and what other players are attempting to do to score points (this can range from anything from having the most towns, owning the most explore tokens, having the most progress cards etc) and all players benefit from them. This is such an ambitious game and it succeeds on a number of levels, but primarily on account of it being a deeply strategic experience that incorporates a wealth of Euro-style mechanisms yet maintains a highly thematic feel. I hope that this begins a trend for similar heavy Euros where the theme is integral to the overall design of the game.

Quite a good game, not sure about real replayability though: although setup and goals can vary enormously, it seems the setup and goal kinda 'shoehorn' you into a specific way of playing. 

Compared to f.e. Terra Mystica, the setup (i.e. race) you have there much less determines your way of playing as the dependency of other players' actions is so much greater.

So while I would be willing to play this again, probably don't have to own this.

Works oddly as solo, but could be fun with the right mind-set. Works ... ok as a two-player game. The timing mechanisms don't feel very good. The character cards one in particular went by way too fast.

The game itself is quite solid and I think it'll be really really fun with more players and/or more plays.

My gaming group is so competative that the whole everybody looses if there are to many rebels is devastating. Everybody have a different opinion on how much everybody should help everybody on order to not lose the game. Everybody contributing equally is not fair for those who are not in the lead, and nobody wants to be the player that "sacrifices" himself for the greater good. Even worse with the victory condition that one player might have that he wins if the rebels take over. 

It has nice potential, but the rebel mechanic seems a little broken when playing with a very competative group.

RATING: 4.8
The more I think about this, the less I like it. The action selection is fairly generic but worked well and seemed fresher because of the circular board. The discovery seemed to massively favour those who found stone in the early turns and then those who found tiles that fitted later on.

I really am starting to dislike hidden objectives, especially when scores might be so low that happening to have achieved an extra card was with 1/3 of someone's score.

Oddly though despite all of these issues, I quite enjoyed my first play.

Update: On a second play, the game felt less chaotic and it was largely possible to formulate a plan and stick to it. That said, the traitor card is bloody stupid and so if they are last in turn order the game encourages losing players to abandon the game and let everyone lose as resources are so tight that they have no incentive to spend anything to keep the game going.

Further update: The more I think about this, the more convinced I am that this game is broken as it comes. In my most recent play of it, I offered the player who was able to avert the crisis that killed us enough resources to effect a four point swing in his favour. This would have taken him from last to joint second. This is before he collected stone which was being offered by another player and was a known VP condition. However, because the resources I was offering were hidden, neither he nor I knew their true value. How can you negotiate with resources when their relative values are unknown and largely unknowable? To fix this game, you probably need to start with more money, have all objective cards face up and completely change/abandon the turn order bidding. Of course, you'd still have a lot of useless, overpriced cards in the game.

Rating down from 6.4 to 4.8, but this could easily be my first one rating. I think, in most circumstances, it is broken.

This game is gorgeous and busy on the table. I dig the modularity: its design evokes a rogue-like, and I love rogue-likes.

I've played two three-player short games, with new folks both times. Neither game was "short;" you'll spend an hour teaching the rules, and then 2.5 hours hazily recalling them across five rounds.

Archipelago creates a weird brainspace: it is uncertain, overcomplicated, and strangely tense. Eeeverything you do tips the see-saw, but you can't really tell how. It's bizarrely happenstance under the guise of being nuanced and intricate. I hate the hidden objectives. I still want to like the game.

The solo scenarios are okay, but they don't entirely work: the crises and the economy break too arbitrarily without multiple players to bolster them.

There is so much going on, in such a wonderful way. This design could easily have crashed and burned in a bogged down mess, but instead it shines like a star in the boardgaming sky!

edit: the cooperative part is really tricky. A player that pays to help out really loses a lot. That makes it very easy to lose against the game. Harsh reality, but it kind of takes away some of the fun. Lowered the grade.

Tentative rating after one learning game. Bares some resemblance to Keyflower, and I mean that as a compliment. I enjoy the exploration aspect, as well as the player interaction. I'm not sure how I feel about all of the secret endgame conditions; they might put just a bit too much out of the players' control. I certainly want to play again.

UPDATE: After a couple more plays, I'm still intrigued. There is a lot going on, and many strategies to explore. That said, I think in many ways this game is best experienced as a game of exploration. Not so much in the islands (although there is that), but rather as an exploration of mechanics. I'm tempted to say the game is too complicated for its own good (a trait I never like), but I think uncovering all the complications is sort of the point here. In that case, can I really fault the game for delivering on a promise?

It took me a while to wrap my head around some of the rules.  Now it's going to take me a while to wrap my head around the strategy.  This is an extremely heady, highly interactive and strongly thematic worker placement game that contains loads of variety -- it's basically the photo negative of games like Lords of Waterdeep or Pillars of the Earth.  

My initial game was bewildering and a bit sluggish (though I was trying to learn it at midnight after a full day of games) but I think repeated plays should make the game blossom.  My rating will probably rise with experience.

One of the prettiest games I've played as well (though counting the native huts on the tiles is like reading a "Where's Waldo?" book).

This is one heavy beast with a confusing rulebook. The game is very interesting and contains so many elements, so much to look out for - that it takes an awfully long time to explain and it would take quite a few sessions before you can grasp the way the cogs in this game work. There really is lots to explore in this game and by saying this I do not mean the literal exploration of the map but the ways the interaction in this one works.

"Short" game has gone 90 minutes with 4 players and 120 with 3 (the variability seeming to depend on how easy or difficult the end game conditions are to meet).  A lot of fiddliness involved but seems like it will be rewarding if you're willing to put the time in; improves with more plays.  Medium game tends to go over 3 hours (we abandoned our last one at 3 hours when we were only about half way to anybody's end game conditions).  I do feel the scoring is the weakest part of this game as the end in a short game can sometimes happen before some players have had chance to start pursuing their hidden conditions, and the conditions involving hoarding a particular good can swing too easily to one player through a lucky draw of a land tile.

Probably the Essen title in which I'm most interested. Christophe B. is one of my favorite desigers, so a Euro with his name on it seems like the perfect blend.

Was offered a trade for this that I couldn't refuse. It's in the mail and should be in my hands before Christmas. I'm very happy.

I also have the solo expansion coming in the mail.

I played half a game in my hotel room while traveling for work. It got late and I had to work the next morning, so I had to put it away. It's very interesting. I can say there's no other game I've played like it. I'm excited to play it soon.

2/22/13 - I finally played a full game of this. Although it didn't feel full since we played a short scenario. The game seemed to end as soon as it got rolling. I'll probably never play a short game again. Even for teaching. I think it's a better idea to teach in the medium game so players can get the mechanics down before it's over. The short game doesn't allow for that.

I think there's a great game here and I'm excited to explore it further.

+ Very cool market systems.

+ Love the theme and it translates through to the game play.

+ Excellent production values. Beautiful artwork, nice wooden pieces, lot of stuff.

- Scoring seems random and unbalanced. Some hidden goals are actions you naturally take throughout the game, some you have to go out of your way to do. Winning scores in the single digits give very little resolution in deciding the winner.

- Traitor mechanic doesn't work very well. There's no real way to combat the traitor.

- Terrible artwork for the "rebelling native".

I really wanted to love this game, but after giving it more plays than it probably deserved I gave up and traded it away.

Troublesome for a few issues. Treatment of natives and slaves, with little moral context, is problematic. Betrayer mechanic seems to me to break rather than make a game based around economic development. A game that looks like it should be nice if complex is actually rather nasty.

RATING: 8.5
2-5 players.

A 4x game that doesn't involve any direct conflict, infact it's self marketed as "Semi-Cooperative".

Set as colonists essentially ransacking islanders native homes, you have to manage resources and population demands together. 

The trick to this one is that each player only knows one trigger that ends the game and only one way they can definitely score points.
Literally prettiest game I own barring Tokaido.

Constantly negotiate and screw over people with your nickle-and-diming selfish ways, but that won't win you the game as you all LOSE together!

Very different game, that I need to get out in a group.  The problem is it would need to be played multiple times with the same players before any of the nuance and strategy came into play.  Out of the gate it's just a free-for-all, almost too sandboxy for it's own good, I almost wish there was a beginner's game rules or something, because it's a bit much to introduce, I guess playing the short game is an option. 

I can see myself going through the pain of getting it out, having a clunky first go, with a luke warm response and then shelving it until we all forget the rules and strategies again.

I need to play this again before settling on a rating, but initial thoughts are that this is too free-form for my taste, given the wide open trading rules. It also has several mechanisms that I don't care for- blind bidding for turn order, losing bids are forfeit. Random hazards occuring, random exploration tiles, yet exploring is proceded by partial knowledge of what is being discovered, and yet could result in a total bust. Odd cooperation required to prevent the game from defeating the players. It just seemed like a big goulash of mechanisms that was quite chaotic, yet I am sure the second game will be better now that the consequences of accelerated growth and such have been experienced.

RATING: 8
This is a great game. Very nice mechanics, extreme variety, clever victory conditions. It is a fascinating game because you do not know when the game will end, you try to deduct the victory conditions.
But the original game is cooperative and it does not work (the player in last place always will force the rebellion).
We play with the following changes:
Benefactor variant : benefactor is always in place plus one more victory condition, and the pacifist and the rebellion cards are always out of the game.
In the turn order phase, only the winner pays money (everyone else gets his money back (in a case of a tie; all tied players pay money and they bid again; if nobody bids, turn order remains unchanged). This gives penalty to the player that wins the order auction (going first is too powerful in this game).
The game with the above changes becomes fully competitive and it shines!

An interesting semi co-op.  Win alone or lose together.  I tend to be either all co-operative or all competitive, so I don't do well at this game.

RATING: 7.5
This one has great mechanics, especially the market forces and political upheaval that drive much of the decision making and shot-taking players engage in when they weigh risks of the many action and evolution options. The theme really comes through in the mechanics.

Really, the ONLY complaint is that the game can be extremely susceptible to luck. This is particularly true when playing a solo scenario, as starting conditions and resource options at hand can be very bleak for many of the character choices.

Supply and demand, and their impacts on the workforce, both domestic and export markets have never been modeled so well in a board game before!

RATING: 9
Absolutely awesome. Archipelago combines about 6 different games into one delicious broth, and although I only get it to the table around once or twice a year it is so worth it.

The components are absolutely gorgeous, the adjustable game length works fantastically well, and the semi-cooperative nature of the game leads to some VERY interesting situations. There is a tenuous balance between your individual economic plans and the larger-scale dilemmas the game throws at the group. Maybe one of you is a gross saboteur though, and wants to see it all come crashing down. Finding the sweet spot between being competitive and being realistic is always so engrossing. 

If you can get the appropriate group together (and if you can find any copies) I can't recommend it highly enough. 

(Although the subject matter is something to consider before purchasing. A game about colonisation and exploitation will not suit everyone, and the game's depiction of marginalised groups definitely leaves something to be desired.)

This feels like two games - a complex yet elegant exploration, resource and resource control game with a dense, possibly unnecessarily complex overlay with the kitchen sink (special cards, workers vs. rebels, secret objectives that determine most of the game VPs, and even a secret traitor!).  

It really doesn't help that the game has beautiful but nearly unreadable iconography, or that it's critically important to read exactly what special cards are in front of every opponent, and this is really difficult to do because of a lack of any iconography at all on many of these cards.

I'd want to try this again with a subset of the rules, the parts that I think might work just fine without all the bells and whistles.

Provisional score after one play (in which we all lost.) I suspect future plays may take this up to 10 because I think the game is just so darn clever. The issue for me is that I feel the game will only really soar when all the players have the same level of experience with it. It's also very dependent on the players being comfortable with the initial lack of information. It's the kind of game that restores my belief in the artistry of game design.

Un grand jeu semi-coopératif d'exploration et de gestion d'une colonie. C'est un jeu et non une simulation. Le jeu est très riche en possibilités. Il faut déduire les objectifs des autres joueurs et chercher à suivre leur développements pour les maximiser ses PV tout en camouflant ses propres objectifs. Il ne faut jamais oublier de travailler en groupe pour entretenir la colonie et gérer les crises car si la colonie plante, tous perdent. À moins que votre objectif soit de pousser le mécontentement au maximum pour déclencher une guerre d'indépendance. Le seul hic: on dirait que le jeu conduit aux mêmes cheminements. Oui on n'achète pas les mêmes trucs par exemple, mais il faut bien ouvrir sa partie (il y a des ouvertures classiques). Si les joueur optimisent leur jeu, on se rend compte qu'il y a un hasard qui donne un avantage à un joueur (tuile de terrain, ressources disponibles, cartes disponibles).

Lighter than expected. Cardinal sin: it's boring. Many decisions but not too difficult, so it FEELS really fiddly sometimes. Semi-cooperative aspect is not helping either: if you become too agressive, game fails. It's more of a full co-op game with hidden goals. Or maybe I'm wrong? Well, I don't care for author's vision (I think it's time for him to make a simple yet deep game for a change - otherwise he'll fall into the ocean of self-adoration) If I can't find my way to play the game and have fun, I don't need it.

Buy only, if you need a nice, family civ game with open environment and cooperation. If you like brain burning - avoid. If you like streamlined games - avoid. If you think playing separatist is fun as playing Cylon - avoid.

Overbloated creation.

The best example of how a semi-cooperative game should not be designed.

Archipelago was also one of my "first" modern board games, and learning the rules was a serious undertaking.
Teaching the game to my wife and other friends was another challenge in of itself, as there are constantly things that need to be considered throughout each phase of each turn.
Archipelago is full of challenges - the frequent "crisis" and "balance" events/phases in the game are often a turnoff for players, especially once the action starts to heat up and the play area has grown substantially from the initial tile.  Also, the "evolution card" phase of the game really drags the pace of the game down, as players have gone from hashing out moves on the playfield to stopping and reading a bunch of cards, dealing with crisis events as new cards are played, and dealing with the resulting depletion of resources.  Also, as stated above, it's typically good to have at least one player who has studied the rules significantly, who can be the one to chime in and say things like, "No you can't explore there as your colonist in the neighboring tile is engaged" or, "No you can't place that worker/offspring there - you already have three colonists on that tile" or, "no you can't perform that action due to the restriction caused by this other player's active evolution card..."  Of course, those corrections often frustrate the other players, and makes the knowledgeable player seem like a "know-it-all."
All that said however, the game can really be a lot of fun once all the players really start to understand the strategy, and even more so when players start to work together to keep the game balanced and working smoothly.  I truly appreciate that its a game you have to work together in order to keep playing, but can still have your own, hidden agendas.

Archipelago is an incredibly bright and happy looking game. As you explore and build the island chain, it continues to foster generous thoughts and co-operative gameplay. But then an economic crisis happens. The people demand cattle for food and clothing. The island produces plenty of cattle, yet the market is empty. Who is hoarding the cattle?!? The indigenous population grows restless. They are now refusing to work. The crown demands ore, but the workforce refuses to mine it. The crackdowns come and portions of the island start to fall to insurrection. You start to suspect one of your fellow colonists has gone native. He has decided to throw off the yoke of tyranny!

At least now you know where all the cows went.

I love this game.

That's not to say it doesn't have a few issues. One, the rulebook isn't very clear. When exactly a worker can move or not move when working a building is confusing. There is also an issue where less savory players can grief the game and send it spiraling out of control. The resources are delicately balanced between demand and availability. While this is necessary to create the tension that occurs when honest players are trying to scrape off a little selfish profit, it flat out doesn't work when someone foolishly tanks a market out of spite.

I don't play with that sort, so the game works beautifully. It is a very ambitious design and a completely unique take on the worker placement/ resource swapping genre. I do wish it was a little more intuitive and the procedural side of maintaining the various markets holds down my rating just a bit, but I could eventually even get over that, because the game is so much fun.

Superbly crafted semi-cooperative worker placement. Players have to think about their own victory options while at the same time they have to be careful not to cause the game to "win" over the players.

Played it 3 times.  An interesting game, with some fun, interesting, and creative parts, but I just am not convinced.  "Grand" winner seems a bit arbitrary.  For example, last game, trend card was temples and I had the temple end game card.  I had the good fortune to luck into starting on a spot with two stone and have the stone super harvest card come up early.  Unless we "lost," I was almost destined to win before the game started.

This game has quickly become a favorite. I am not the biggest fan of semi-coops (which this is) but this one strikes a nice balance. It can make the game kind of intense and if your group doesn't do well with some backstabbing or lying this may be a bad choice.

However, there are great elements in this game. There are a variety of end game conditions ways to score points which makes the game interesting. Trying to work out your opponents cards can be a fun puzzle. I highly suggest you try before you buy, but it is a pretty solid design.

I've only played the game solo and only once, but I like where it's going. There are a lot of different balances in the game: the number of colonists vs rebels, the number of surplus workers and how much money you have, the goods in the domestic market and export market versus the balance of the archipelago. It's hard to keep in your head, and I'd wager that you'll forget something your first few turns or games, but there's a very interesting game here. 

I haven't played the game with other people yet, so I'm still worried about the Pacifist, the Separatist, and disgruntled gamers throwing the game, but I think with a warning at the beginning and a rational group, it shouldn't be a problem.

Explore, colonize, and develop the island. Harvest, mature the island market and trade in the export market with the old world. Manage the local labor supply and negotiate how and who will step up to face the impending threats to the island.  Exploration and other aspects are exciting. Secret triggered game ending objectives builds game end tension in a good way.  The amount of negotiation bogs us down which surprises me. Might give this another try another day.

Archipelago is a excellent mixture of Role Playing and Euro games. It gives you a Euro scenario, with Euro mechanics but it lets you be whatever you want.

You don't need to draw a "do bad stuff" card to screw your friends. Also, you don't need to build armies to protect yourself from the jerk who's screwing everyone. Everything in Archipelago can be done and solved with the greatest game mechanic of all time: talking.

Every kind of negotiation is allowed in Archipelago, you can trade basically anything anytime you want, you may bribe someone to just stop doing whatever he is doing, or you can just convince someone to do something else because you have reasonable arguments. I mean, Archipelago is real life in a board, you have to deal with the player's personalities and be smarter in all levels.

Very deep game, I love it!

"8: Very good game. Rarely disappoints me."

The game that introduced me to gaming heavier than Catan and the other mainstream titles. The game that introduced me to BGG.

Does not get played as often as before, but does not disappoint when we do play it.

Oh mama. There are so many wonderful things going on in this game. All the gears and cogs come together and spin the machine into a wonderful whirling dervish of awesomeness. The social aspects of the game, the push and pull of the economy, the hidden roles, the exploration...it's all so vast and fantastic.

I must play this more.

Even the short game took us 3 hours with five players.. but I did enjoy the game. So a 7 for now, but could go either way.

Really want to try a medium/long length game (I have a feeling I will like it a lot more!). The short was good, but ended before everything got more exciting. Love the interaction between the players with the everyone loses condition.

I remember being interested in this game when it came out in 2012. It seemed to have an interesting mix of exploration, resource management, and confrontation. It also helped that the game is visually stunning as well. Unfortunately though... I don't know why I never decided to pull the trigger. I'm not sure if it was the potential game length or how the game ends that turned me off at that time, but it was something that I just never picked up. Having being able to get it recently though in a math trade... I'm very much interested in finding out if those reviews that made me want it so many years ago were true.

And... having now been able to get a single play under my belt... I'm happy that I picked the game up. The game is a bear to teach and there's a lot to take in but, once you get through a few rounds, you can see how things come together. It seems like there's a lot of strategy and depth to this game with a lot of room to explore (no pun intended). This is my initial tentative rating of the game. I have a feeling that it could increase over subsequent plays.

I have yet to play anything but a short game. It's fun but they're usually learning sessions and the people I usually game with don't do epic games.

Strange game. What makes Archipelago so hard to classify, for me, is that all the ingredients for a great game are basically there. The components are great, the visual design is wonderful, the flavor and feel of the game are very much present in gameplay, the mechanics are relatively elegant, you get a bucketload of options without feeling overwhelmed, the duration is customizable (depending on playgroup and available time)... One would think this has to be a great game. 

Unfortunately, it's not. It's not bad, not by a long shot, but it feels somehow... frustrating. Mainly because you get the feeling so much time went into designing balanced mechanics and beautiful bits and bobs that one fundamental question got overlooked: what am I playing for? Sure, the hidden objectives are nifty, but feel unsatisfying. It basically boils down to spending a couple of hours doing all sorts of interesting things, only for the game to suddenly end, after which you count stuff and determine who won, usually by a very slim margin. The problem with this is that it feels as though there's a disconnect between the actions you've been taking all throughout the game and the scoring. Sure, you work towards your own objective, and you can deduce what certain other players are up to, but literally anything can be taken into account in the scoring and there's always something you overlook. Archipelago plays as though rather than taking a core victory mechanic (i.e: this is how you win) and building a game around it, the game designers instead started by designing a great thematic balanced game with all sorts of interesting mechanics, only to realize they forgot to put in a victory condition at the very last staff meeting before release. And so the victory conditions ended up being stuff that was already in the game. It's all stuff you do anyway - buildings you build, resources you accumulate... you just need to have one more than your neighbors. 

The fact that the level of immersion is immense only worsens this feeling. When you make a game this epic, you want an epic conclusion, like, I dunno, world domination. Or something. As it is, only the rebellion feels like a glorious ending, and that's the one you want to avoid. Everything else is just mucking about to grab a few points left and right.

Bon gros jeu pour vivre une aventures avec ces ami(e)s. 
Plusieurs niveau de jeu influant principalement sur la longueur de celui-ci et faisant varier les partie de 1H à 3H (en moyenne).
Avis basé sur 3 parties en niveau moyen.

Quite a lot of different mechanisms, all combined into a world exploration, resource gathering, worker placement mess, that is actually somewhat fun.  It could easily lose the first player bid throwaway.  Learning to play is a little daunting, but when finally playing, it's not that complicated.  I look forward to playing it a couple more times.

Mixes a lot of gameplay elements (exploration, worker placement, semi-cooperative) beautifully. Only downside to this game is the negotiation aspect, which I don't always enjoy in games, however you can just not engage in negotiation and still do fine.

Tentative rating after a solo short game to learn the rules.  I had high hopes, but was a bit underwhelmed so far.  Couldn't find anybody else interested in playing it so I traded it.

I [b]really[/b] like aspects of this, but the very nature of the exploration can lead to situational advantages, for which the unlucky players must compensate in order to compete with the lucky ones.

Played a couple of times. Not 100% sure how much I like it, but I could see this going to 9 since each play I like it more. There's a certain elegance to the game that entices me to want to play it again.

FINALLY got this one to the table. Only played a 'short' game but it was loved. I got accused by a bystander of being a bastard negotiator, but whatevs. Really need to get more plays of this in, but it's kind of a pain to teach.

I liked it after one play. It feels like the anno series on pc. A civilization game were you balance population, unhappiness, employment etc together as a group. I see a lot of potential play and lots of room for negotiation.

After more plays (without traitor): 
I really like the mechanisms in this game but not so much the hidden objectives. This is a game were I enjoy playing it more than winning it. Sessions tend to be very long even if there isn't that much negotiation going on. The handling of the little crises during evolution phase are annoying because they abruptly interrupt the gameflow and cause downtime. 

I have not played with traitor since I played it with different people and didn't want them to become frustrated immediately, but the more I play it, the more I recognize the traitor is an essential mechanism.

Wow. Group dug this hardcore. I was totally surprised. We all agreed that the goals are a bit too random to be strategic enough for consistent plays, but this game will definitely hit the table once in awhile. 

Edit: 9/28/15
I was wrong. It hit the table never in ever. We all thought back and realized the goal system is simply anti-fun.

BEAUTIFUL game that feels way more adversarial than you might first think. Several innovative parts, and I love the exploration of the islands and building up the land. Variable game length options are available, but none are ludicrous in length.

And props to the art on the hexes too. You'd be hard pushed to find a nicer looking game.

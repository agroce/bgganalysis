I really, really enjoy this game! I've only played Chris's copy, but we played it at least 3 times, and I think it's the best racing game I've ever played (though that isn't saying a lot).  Would love to get a copy of it.

RATING: 7
Very attractive game. Rules are a bit soft and could be better written. The original track seems longer than necessary. Overall, it's a good tactical racing game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
1 play (x3 tracks) / 8 players

LIKE: Interesting strategy and nice dice mechanism to shake things up.
DISLIKE: Very competitive and some quirky rules. The horses were top-heavy and hard to move without tipping over. Falling into last place is unexciting and frustrating.

OVERALL: The competitiveness left me fatigued and disinterested, so I couldn't muster the energy to grasp the optimal plays. The racing feels similar to Formula De, so not something I am interested in, but I could see others enjoying it.

RATING: 6
A racing game.  Interesting aspects: handicapping of those in the lead, turn order jockeying, forced to maximum route, alternating between cards and dice.

Played an 8-player game.  Downtime was annoying, particularly since it primarily involved watching others count out their movement.

I would play this again, though I wonder if the sweet spot isn't more around 5-6 players.  With 8, it was very crowded (which is good and bad), but the downtime was atrocious.  Would rate higher except for the downtime.  Honestly, this one just didn't do it for me.

Well produced horse racing game with rather more skill to the card-play than is first apparent.  Somehow it hasn't generated much excitement in the groups I've played with.  Perhaps it's a bit too calculable.  A three-race game takes a tad too long as well.

For me, best horseracing (not horse betting) game out there.  Also, gorgeously overproduced, with great cards, dice and horses.  I love the look of the game, but it might be more popular (and back in print) with less lavish production values.

RATING: 8
The best horse racing game I've come across in terms of mechanics for the actual races. The game consists of three races round an oval track with each player using a sub deck of ten cards from their total pack of 32. Horses in the first three positions are 'handicapped' by a maximum move rate which tends to produce a bunched pack until the final turn and straight when players use their 'Jokers' to remove the movement restriction. Add to this that every other move is a 'dice' round where in turn each player can choose the sum of two dice or the value of one of them for all horses to move. Interesting choices throughout especially when it is your turn to throw the dice.

Adding the fences to create a steeplechase race creates a whole new set of problems.

Lack of betting may be a problem for some tho'
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Awesome components... I can almost justify the cost to myself.

Game-play is great as far as slowly presenting subtle strategies and simulating race conditions (or what I imagine horse racing is like)... and "do not do that again" type situations - like getting pin against the railing when the lead horse fails to move due to handicapping issues... : p
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A HUGE hit at Thursday night group.  Movement alternates between playing cards, and one player rolling dice and deciding how many spaces everyone can move.  Quite strategic, and a nice break from other racing games.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Okay race game, but my impression is that you cannot do well unless you have a strong hand (i.e. luck of draw is significant).  Avoid getting stuck in the pack... it's very hard to break away.  Many slower horses will make their move on the last or next-to-last turns (by playing 11s and 12s and staying in the outer lane)... if the front-runners don't make a "wall" 3-4 horses wide, expect many position changes in those turns.  Seems to have a rich-get-richer problem in the sense that your finish position in race 1 determines your start position in race 2.  I like that everyone starts with the same set of cards randomly divided between three races so your hand will always be different and you must play to the strenth of your given hand.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Like this a lot.

Beautiful bits, fast game play - and a nice mix of luck and skill. Bit fiddly if you play with 2 horses each and colours are hard to distinguish in low light.

RATING: 8
Awesome racing game, especially if you can fill the track up with the max number of jockeys.  Hand and risk management is key, with plenty of opportunities for clever movement.  It really does a great job of simulating horse racing, as you need to pick the right time to take the lead... leading the entire race, while possible, probably isn't going to happen.  The bits in this one are first-rate!

I simply didn't get enough entertainment out of the 1 time - 3 races I played. Even with some fences. It is a very accurate portrayal of a horse race however. 1 Play
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
There are definitely real decisions in the hand management and movement (if the other players don't try to make them for you). However, the downtime and length required to play 3 races with 7-8 players (the handicapping rules discourage playing with fewer players) is a lot long for what the game gives you. And 3 races are required, unlike Daytona 500 where it's suggested but really not necessary.
 
The problem with the length is really in the die rolls. Almost all of the die rolls are meaningless in the game. Everyone moves ahead the same number of squares starting with the leader, so places all essentially hold. Nothing can be done that could not have been done on the prior card play. Only around 5 rolls per game (out of around 30 total) will kickstart the leader-bashing mechanic. That's 25 basically useless movement rounds for a rein-in-the-leader mechanic. Seems like poor design to me

There isn't much of a narrative to the races either. The horses generally stay pretty well bunched up for the entire course. Considering the hype, I was sorely disappointed.

A well done racing game, if not a bit long.  Hand management plays a big factor and you can get kind of screwed by not getting a good mix of cards.  You can also try and set up situations where the horse on the inside lane crashes on a hurdle, which is pretty fun and brutal.  It does play six players, so that is a nice bonus.

Great game ! Truly one of the best racing games around. Nice bits, simple rules, and the right mix of strategy (70%) and luck. Accomodates up to 8 players. It is more fun and even richer tactically to play with 2 horses per player. 
The full racing program (3 or 4 races) takes circa 3 hours and is perhaps a tad too long...

RATING: 7
I've played this a couple of times and really enjoy it.  It has a pretty big luck element in that if you get in the lead and a 9 or higher is rolled on 2D6, you could effectively miss an entire turn.  But it works well because you know who will be rolling...if you charge out to the front and the rolling player is behind...you are taking your chances and know the consequences.  I'd recommend this game...especially if you find that your often have a group of 7 in attendence.

Reminds me a lot of Ave Caeser, but with a finer grid resolution.   There's some dice rolling to boot.   A very pure racing game and seems to simulate a horse race pretty well.

Played 1 time (6 players). I had often heard this compared to Royal Turf. (Or rather, I've heard Royal Turf referred to as"dumbed down TurfMaster"). But I found that the game are quite different. Naturally both games are about horseracing and are bound to have similarities, but TurfMaster is a hand management/racing game that uses a card-driven movement system with leader handicaps and (in my opinion) a bizarre penalty system for the leaders), whereas Royal Turf is a betting game where any player can move any horse and it is more of a movement-manipulation game. I found TurfMaster rather "vanilla" and can't see any reason to play it again. The movement was pedestrian (excuse the pun!) and the leader penalties (the dice-rolling "leader exclusion" mechanic)...well...it sucks.

Great game with lots of players! Since everyone gets to use all their cards through the three races, that helps to minimize a very good or bad hand for one of the races. Alternating dice rolls for movement give individual players more control. One has to carefully position their horses if 'in the pack' to avoid getting 'tail in the face.'

Most horse racing games tend to focus on the betting (Royal Turf, Win Place & Show, Jockey, The Really Nasty Horse Racing Game, Grand National Derby).  But in TurfMaster, it's the maneuvering within the race itself that drives the game.  Play alternates in rounds of dice play and card play.  During the dice rounds, one player rolls and all horses move the same number of spaces, but the leaders might not get the full allotment because they must abide by strict maximum limits.  During the card rounds, players move their horses using cards from a limited hand.  They must ration these cards throughout three successive races.

Why do I like the game?  It's gorgeous.  It does a good job simulating a horse race.  Players make interesting decisions that matter, but that aren't so complex that they bog the game down.  It plays well for 7 or 8 players.  The last point is perhaps the most important.  There aren't many games I enjoy playing with 7 or 8 players (except for party games), and most of them are appetizers rather than main courses.  TurfMaster is the rare example of a main course that works for up to 8 people.

Q: Is this game worth such a hefty price tag?

Q: Is TurfMaster or Formula De the better game?

A: TurfMaster is the better game. The rule complexity is similar and it playes in about the same time frame. However, TurfMaster offers a much better balance between control and luck.

If you like race games or even think you might, I whole heartedly recommend this game, even with the sticker shock.

A great horse racing game. The horses are advanced alternatively by cards played and dice rolled. The cards allow for planning, and the dice allow for randomness.

good racing game.

you need a full field of 8 players for this to work well, so not an easy game to get on the table.

The grand-daddy of all horse racing style games. Unique movement involves alternating dice rolls with a card movement stage. Block your opponents, but plan your race well: don't break too early and lose in the home stretch. Has beautiful hand painted horses for up to 8 racers with matching dice and cards which makes this one of the most elegant looking boardgames there is. Multiple tracks are available. An expensive but great game, well worth it if you love the racing genre! Can really only find this now directly from the publisher.TOP#10

Best racing game I've played to date, and the production values are tremendous.  Much more strategy than Formula De.

After four plays I'm convinced this merits a high rating.  There's some randomness in the card draws and die rolls to be sure, but players will see each one of their 32 cards throughout the 3-race series so the randomness is a variable to be managed.  The steeplechase variant is nasty, and a bad hand can leave one doomed.

I'm not always in the mood for TurfMaster, but it never fails to entertain on the two occasions a year I do play.

Liked this a lot. Played it on the same evening I also played Winner's Circle for the firt time. I bought a copy of Winner's Circle and not this, only because Winner's Circle is easier to get people to play. The more I thought about it though, the more I wanted it, so I got it as well.

RATING: 8
A very tense and exciting racing game.  Beautiful bits.  This is probably the best racing game I've played.  The only thing that keeps it from getting a higher rating is that it seemed like starting on the outside was too substantial a penalty to overcome, but that might be inoptimal play on my part.  Might raise this on future playings.

RATING: 10
Love how this feels like being on your horse and jockeying for position. Frustrating as hell when you get boxed in between or behind other horses. The lane changing restrictions perfectly capture the feel of navigating through a pack of driving thoroughbreds. The die-rolling mechanic can create some real interesting changes on the board. Looks great too. Wonderful rules-light, but theme-heavy game.

Nice production value.  The game really does seem to do a good job in emulating the feel of a horse race.  I enjoy the handicap of the leaders and the potential for screwage with the right dice rolls.  The game can drag a little if players don't instantly take their turn, but even at 8 players it wasn't unbearably long.  I'm still curious what the right number of players would be and I'd like to investigate further.  With 8 horses things can get pretty crowded.  I think the card draw can really set you back, though good hand management really seems to be the key, as well as a little bit of luck.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A long lasting and great looking game that has really captured the feeling of racing. However the dice are quite frustrating and the way of creating odds should probably have been thought through a bit more thoroughly. Also, passing by competitors is really hard and the available cards in hand heavily dictate the choice whether or not to try to get to the pole position when the few opportunities for that arise. That of course is probably like the real tactical level in real life races. It's a bit boring to play during the third race if you're out of competition for winning the game as a whole. Overall, anyway, a fine game I'd love to try with 8 players.

I have had the chance to play this once. It's a simple game that rewards strategic use of your cards. Everyone has the same deck of cards and once you use a card it's gone, so you really have to measure the cost/reward for burning your best cards. I enjoyed the simplicity but it overstayed its welcome for me. It is extremely difficult to maneuver your horse around the racers, so once your behind it could be your best option just to throw the race. Since the game takes place over 3 races, just because you lose one doesn't mean you'll lose the game. However, since each individual race lasts about 20 minutes, throwing one of those race on purpose is somewhat of a long, process of not having as much fun as I would like in a game this light and, in fact, I found myself feeling a bit frustrated. 

So, a bit too long for what it is. Interesting but limited strategy. And a bit frustrating. Not my favorite.

One of the best racing games ever. Original mechanism of alternating turns with cards and dice. Each player has the same set of 32 cards with 10 for each of the three races. In the turn with the dice, one player throws and the result counts for all players. Low on luck, lots of skill and tactical play needed to win. Amazing how closely packed the horses remain throughout the race, just until the last straight line before the finish.

I want to like this game far more than I actually do and perhaps rate it higher than I should.  Q-Jet really scratches the same itch in many ways and does it much more quickly and efficiently.  Turfmaster Deluxe is beautifully produced although it is fairly easy to knock over the horses.  The added dice movement round and having all 10 cards in hand to be strategically thinking about when to play high and low cards is what sets this game apart/different than Q-Jet.  This also extends the game so it becomes a question of whether the longer time commitment is worth more choices.

My favorite game and the supreme racing game! Everything you want in a racing game along with very nice components and it's without play money, bonus! Should be #1 among the race games. Simulates the best horse race from a jockey's perspective and fun decision making. You need to know when to make a move or break to the outside so you don't get trapped coming around the last corner. This game is all about timing. Amazing how a dice roll of one can change the positioning in certain circumstances and give you an opening for the next turn.

RATING: 6
One of the better racing games in that it does a good job of keeping the leaders in check and forcing players to save their energy for the finish.  Since there are usually 3 races there are some tough decisions to make in what cards to play in that you can save cards for future races.  Downside: it's pretty analytical especially since it's a game of inches and can take awhile.  UPDATE: Knocked down 1.5 points.  This game is wearing on me quickly.  You need to really manage your cards and movement carefully but then often a die roll or some other somewhat uncontrollable calamity can ruin your fortunes right before the finish line.  It should be fine, after all it's a horse race.  However, the game usually takes up to 2 hours to play.

A confession. After 1176 titles played, this is the first time ever I've played a game thinking it was a new game to me, and then finding out later that I'd actually played it before (once, back in 2002 in this case). I have absolutely no recollection, and had no inkling at all whilst playing that this was anything but a new game to me. But the database doesn't lie. The fact that I don't recall it no doubt gives you some insight on where it stands on my gaming totem pole. My gaming preferences have shifted somewhat since 2002 as it wasn't as bad as a "no recall" suggests, but it's just a long Ave Caesar really. Fall back to allow you to play your high cards, don't get boxed in, don't waste spots going around the outside, get to the lead when you've got the cards to see you over the line. A nice twist with the dice/card alternation from move to move.

My favorite racing game, with Formula De a close second. I really like the combination of cards and dice used for movement. With the max. move restrictions on the first three horses on any turn, no player is truly out of the race giving that feeling of a great come-from-behind victory at times.

A great way to describe this (and I am paraphrasing John B. here) is that this actually feels like a racing game. No betting, waging, secret movement or shooting rockets at others but speed, anticipation of others' movements, risk and a bit of luck/momentum. The artwork is not that good and the game lacks the gritty atmosphere of Win,Place and Show but this is a very good racing game. Definitely best with the fences.

Truly great horse racing game that is finally about actually racing horses and not about betting on them.  Everything about this game screams quality, but that quality comes with a significant price tag.  Hell, every horse is painted a different color.  

Fun mechanisms, the decisions for movement are nice in the card play (handicaping the leaders are nice as it emulates being tired), and while you can get totally screwed on the dice, it creates a bit of a catch up mechanism, and adds more tension.

There is the perfect number of great decisions for a racing game.  Best of its kind.

This is such an amazing game, a shame that it is just too expensive for people who aren't die hard gamers.

I try to like this game, but it's very difficult finding players who'll sit through it.  (Most common reaction: Wanting to abandon the game after the first race.  Which, since you've got to manage cards over the course of three races, makes it pretty much pointless.)  And even on the rare occasions I do play a whole day of races, I'm finding myself less and less enthused even though the system and the details seem sound.

RATING: 6.5
[AZA Deluxe 2006 edition] {horse race; roll-and-move; optimal 6-8p} {basic game 6, obstacle rules ??} TurfMaster is quite engaging because the horses are usually close to each other and a player has to find a path to 'break through'. It's quite similar to an actual horse race. So, it's fun to play.

Player interaction is good due to the competition of spaces. The dice rolling gives excitement - TurfMaster will become very dull if only cards are played. There is little down time even for 8 players because each decision is quite simple.  Since each player has his own set of cards, luck due to card draw is low. However, the dice rolling may involve some luck but it will only affect the leading horses. There are tactical decisions in TurfMaster - which card to play, which path to run, when to use the extra 2 cards, etc.  However, I found the handicap rule somewhat artificial.

The horses are decently made. The illustration of the cards and the board is dull. Though it's nice made, it's really expensive.

In all, it's a racing game allows players to plan their paths in advance.

Would like to try the obstacle rules.

Turfmaster is better than other race games because:
1. Once you know the game you have to plan a strategy based on the track, the race, your point standings and most importantly your hand. 

"Do I have a lot of lower cards, well I won't take   first, but if I get out quick and can take the inside lane the whole way (without getting boxed in) I just might get some 3rd place or 4th place points.  Maybe I'll take my bonus cards now just to see if I have to attempt this risky strategy." 

"I have a lot of high cards, but not a lot of Jokers.  I am going to have to figure out how to keep toward the back and avoid the handicap until the last bit and make my push.  If I get out front too soon I won't have a legal card to play and get passed by 4 or 5 horses at the finish.  Timing is everything and I will have to hang on the outside so I don't get out front too soon and so I don't get boxed in.  Low dice rolls will help."

2. Every turn provides a new decision on how to play your cards.  "Did the dice roll cause you to get out too soon?"  "I've got to get positioned to jump that hedge in two turns."

The decisions are all about how to play out your strategy but adjust to the new situation.  

Compare this to Formula D.  Your decision is how best to set up for the curve and to be exiting it at the highest speed possible.  Sometimes the decision is more obvious, but sometimes you are in between and you have to decide to press your luck or play safe.  I like Formula D and I do think there are fun decisions and rolling the die is fun, but it is entirely tactical and not every turn provides a real decision. 

3.  This lead us to the third reason Turfmaster is so good - interesting decisions/time ratio.  

You can play 3 races in the time is takes you to play one lap of Formula D or one and a half laps of Bolide.  The ratio of tough decisions per minute of play is much higher for Turmaster.  

Now a game like Mississppi Queen (which I also love)plays even more quickly, but it is not very strategic.  And the tactical decisions are not always that tough.

And because Turfmaster plays out over three races you can always start fresh if your race is going poorly or you can play riskier and try to pull off a high finish.  

People say that Speed Circuit, Bolide and Formula D really shine when played over a season.  That is because it can sometimes be hard to catch the leader in a typical game, but playing for other points still makes the race meaningful for those in the back.  With Turfmaster you play a small series everytime.  Points for 2nd-4th matter and even positioning beyond that matter for the next race setup.

4.  Catching the leader.  I mentioned above that catching the leader in other race games can be difficult, especially Bolide and Speed Circuit.  Formula D makes it easier to do this and MQ has other mechanics that make it so this isn't a problem at all (river changes abruptly for leader, have to pick up passengers, Black Rose expansion).

In Turfmaster the pack is always tight and the handicap mechanic and dice round makes it extremely difficult to hold the lead for an entire race.  In fact it is not generally desireable to be in the lead for much of the race.  This keeps things interesting for everybody for the entire race, but it does not feel like an awkward or artificial method of keeping the races tight.  It feels like a great horse race.

5.  Turmaster is beautiful.  Only Formula D can compare to Turfmaster in "wow" factor, but I would say the handpainted pewter ponies in Turfmaster edge out Formula D and the beautiful tracks.  

MQ is very nice.  Bolide and Speed Circuit are far from pretty.  

I love all of the games I compared above and others, like Circus Maximus, Win, Place & Show and Warhamster Rally, but to me there is no game better race game and few better games period, than Turfmaster. 




Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 1
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 1
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 3
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 3


Overall - 1

Great horse-racing game, especially fun with six+ players.  There are plenty of strategic movement decisions, and good hand-management strategies.  Plus, there are a variety of races (long, short, steeplechase) and courses that can be run to further enhance gaming.

I was really eager to try out TurfMaster after watching some friends play it and seeing them enjoy it so much.  However, when I did finally have a chance to try it out, I was very disappointed with the game.  It was very repetitive and kind of boring, and really was just way too long for what it was.  Perhaps if it was a 60 minute game then it would work, but playing for 2 to 3 hours was far too long for a game about hand management and dice rolling.  It had some interesting concepts and I actually liked the use of dice in this game (where the same die roll applies to all of the players, but the roller can decide whether to use either or both dice), but it just wasn't nearly as fun as I'd hoped.

Carrera de caballos. En cada carrera un mazo de cartas. El primero, segundo y tercero tienen handicap, máximo movimiento, excepto si utilizan joker. Cambias de carril en el primer movimiento y a partir del septimo solo una vez.No puedes pegarte por detras ni por delante a otro caballo. Despues de cada movimiento de todos el siguiente jugador en tirar los dados tira dos, y elige si todos mueven con uno, con otro o la suma de los dos. Con las vallas te clavas si no las superas con los dados, y matas al caballo si no la superas con carta. La valla cuenta como tres movimientos

Not too much depth, mainly counting spaces and figuring the odds on the dice, but with a lot of players, picking a path through the chaos is great fun.

Having played 14-15 times, I now feel comfortable giving this game top honors because it is always absorbing and consistently rewards good play.  Having all players get the identical 32 cards - but in different, random combinations over three races - is an exceptionally good mechanic.  It means all players have different strengths and weaknesses for each race but in the end have had the same card strength over the length of the game.  Those few commenting that there is too much luck in the game (because of dice rolls and unequal hand strength in any given race) have not played enough or are simply not paying attention.  The dice rolls add a slightly unpredictable but certainly manageable element.  About 85-90% of dice rolls end up with all horses moving the same amount of spaces! Of the remaining rolls, most often one horse (but sometimes two or, rarely, three) lose spaces to the other horses.  However, even the chance of losing some spaces -which generally can only happen on a high dice roll by someone other than those with the lead horses - can be reduced if players are that much more careful of when and how often they push to be one of those top three horses. Even so, "screwage" provides a relatively small (though sometimes poorly timed!) obstacle over three races. In about 1/3 of the games I've played, I have not lost a single space because of die rolls, and often getting such "bad" luck is not bad at all.  It is often quite good to only move 6 spaces from the lead spot while others move 9 spaces, for example.  Besides, the total of any loss to me because of dice rolls has never approached the losses I have had because of my own poor decisions. I honestly believe such comments about luck are made after 1-2 plays by those who do not quite grasp how the game works.  The beautiful set of pearl dice may make it look like a luck-driven game, but it’s just not the case.  The challenge of trying to maximize hands of various types, together with the excellent "handicap" rule on lead horses, makes this is an excellent game all around.  

Fair warning: I can see why for some the game can be rather long 1.5 - 2.5 hours, depending on # of players and experience.  I guess I can see why a few describe it as repetitive (because there's three races on the same track with the same rules for each race?), but the variation of hands, tactics, and strategy - once you get the hang of it - far outweighs any sense of sameness.  Certainly the best game I've ever played that is best with 6-8 players.  Great stuff here.

Expensive with high production quality, but it worths.
The very best horse racing game ever. Dont underrate this game by only looking at its simple layout and rules, or the use of dice. Even in our first game, and even played with some dice protestors, we found the game with rich tactics and strategies because of the wise use of dice and card management and the most cleverest blocking rule. The tension in game did give us the feeling of real horse racing, where horses are packed alongside most of the time. Very tense game.

Always very good horse racing game. Maybe an 8 with the steeplechase rules, but a bit long/slow with the basic rules before the end race action starts. Overall "Leader 1" is a better game offering much of the same gameplay plus more strategy, tactics, resource management, variable roles, race course variety and stage races.

In the context of racing games, TurfMaster fares pretty well. There is a fun sense of decision-making and the components are top notch. I always felt that the game overstayed its welcome just a bit, but I suppose if you were a true fan of the genre you'd appreciate it.

A very good racing game for up to 8 people.  It's light, fun, and relatively quick.  I wish there was a good one race variant.  The cards almost require a 3 race match to make the game work.

An old game, 1998, 2006 for the Deluxe version, with very streamlined and elegant mechanisms. I didn't really know what to expect when I have bought it, but after more than ten games, we have been subdued by Turfmaster. Simple mechanisms that lead to a lot of pleasure.

Decent racer. Played 2 horses per player in a 4-player game and only 2 races. I think 3 would be overkill. It's a pretty typical racer but has very good components.

Played with 8 and it was agonizingly slow. Three races is just too much, especially since each race is similar as the last. Changing the scoring system to reward more points for later races would have helped to increase the tension towards the last race. 

At the end of the last race we had a terrible kingmaker problem: a player in the back rolled the dice and he would decide the winner depending on what he choose. That was a bit of a disappointment after almost three hours of racing, to say the least.

The rules aren't very intuitive (may I change lanes after the fifth move or the sixth? What if there's a steeple involved?), although they do a reasonable good job of simulating a real horse race, I suppose.

All in all, they put some nice components and nice mechanics in the game, but forgot to put in the fun.

RATING: 6
High on the gloss but low on the actual fun.  However, I do think using dice roll to determine the movment for every other round is a neat catch up mechanism for those that are getting screwed by card draws, even if chance still plays a big part in it (because in our game, we often got low result which did not help the people in the back at all).  Related to that, it's important to consider the people that are about to roll the dice and their position in the race, especially towards the finish line.  That should give you an idea whether to take the lead, stay where you are or even to drop back.

Also, the handicap for the first three horses is a nice idea to avoid the runaway leader problem.  The passing took some time to get use to due to the fact that you cannot perform it immediately in front of another racer but an additional space ahead is required, which makes it a bit more difficult.

In retrospect, there is nothing terribly wrong with Turfmaster, I'm just not all that excited about it.

RATING: 7
An interesting simple game, i like the version #2 for the Queen may win; the game portraits in a simple but interesting way the passage from Monarchy by election to Monarchy by blood.

Love the theme. Nice looking board, cards.

Random. Takes a long time to play a game. Diplomacy and warfare.

Got it in a game trade. Looking forword in trying this game out again with the right players. Have fond memories playing this game.

Clever and fun game.

RATING: 7
A fun game that would benefit from a larger game map, giving players more time to establish themselves, and removal of some of the more powerful cards in the deck (e.g. Plague) which can push players out of the game very early (see my game session report 15 June 2003).

Mechanics and components very dated.  However, it feels like a complete fief management game and thematically, all factors have been taken into account.
Would love a remake.

I want to like this game, nice board, nice ideas, but by current standards this game is 'broken' a) because the event cards are way too powerful b) the warfare tends to  wargamishness.  I would love to 'fix' this game.

Spend somme good time playing that one with good friends. No revolution but fun and easy.

Interesting period and wargame of political intrigues and economic expansion, with military might as well.

RATING: 7
Nice strategy game with lots of randomness. Fair recreation of medieval times, with plagues, titles of nobility, alliances between lords and peasant revolts (ouch!). It may take a long time (more than 2 hours) to reach the end of a game, though.

This was a big favourite of my daughters (around the ages of 6 and 10) ! The rules are relatively simple, and the medieval theme combined with princesses and marriages was a hit !!!

Havn't played this for several years now. Played it A LOT while in university.

The interaction between movement combat is very unclear in the rules (can you move when you have combat declared against you? What if you retreat?). Even if you solve those problems the game is too random gor its length.

Antique Fief1 game, upgraded in Fief2. I've re-made all the cards to get it played more often (didn't quite succeed since it shines with 5-6 players and we're typically 4).

RATING: 6
Interesting multiplayer game, that needs differents skills ( diplomacy, warfare, economics ) to win. However, sessions are often too long to complete.

Nice change of pace from Apples to Apples or Cards Against Humanity.  You actually have to string your cards together into a narrative - in this case resume qualifications.  It was silly, deliciously dark, and most of all fun.  Not bad for a game played at work during a holiday party.

Big hit at game night. Huge belly laughs. There were one or two people that it didn't totally click with, but everyone else LOVED it.

We had a group of 13. To move things along, we played the "Running Late" variant and had people "interview" in groups of two.  It moved the rounds at a nice pace and actually amped up the comedy as the people had to then play off each other.  Very fun times.

RATING: 9
Caveat: this is an improv game, some people will die a horrible death along with the game if made to play. Hilarious with the right group! Have never bothered keeping points, just play until the group attitude is done. End at a high point before people start getting tired, usually about 5 rounds. Best with 4 or 5. Less is boring and more is to many applicants. Also had to weed out the sex cards to avoid unammusing awkward laughter.

I hope your the funniest guy at the table because this game will let you know if you're not. It's kind of brutal on introverts. You'll be thinking "How quickly can I string these cards together in a sentence to get these people to stop staring at me". But you laugh and do it anyways. Then you suggest a strategy game as soon as you can. Or not. If you're the "or not" then congratulations, your the funniest guy at the table.

In Funemployed I think I have finally, [i]finally[/i] found a party game that can go toe-to-toe with The Big Idea.

Reading the rules, I was worried that 4 qualification cards would be too restricting. It reminded me uncomfortably of the Once Upon a Time style of storytelling game that in my experience, always results in a "story" that feels nothing but forced.

Fortunately, my worries were unfounded. The cards themselves are all worded pretty loosely, leaving lots of room for interpretation and creative spins. Plus, the rule for swapping out cards in the middle is a GREAT way to make sure you don't get stuck with a bad hand! I like this rule so much I may even use it in The Big Idea from now on!

I also usually don't care for party games where one person is the "judge" - generally it means sitting around doing nothing, but in this case I think putting someone in the position of "interviewer" vs. "interviewee" can lead to some fun roleplay opportunities.

I could gush and gush about this game. Like The Big Idea it has JUST the barest bones of structure with some smartly simple cards to let your group's creativity flow. It's the kind of system that encourages roleplaying [i]even more than many roleplaying games[/i]. And there's so many different ways to use and interpret everything, I suspect it's going to hit the table for years to come.

About the only negative I would say is I think maybe this actually works better with fewer players than with more, or maybe bring it down to 2-3 qualifications per player for bigger groups. If you're playing with a ton of people you're more likely to get a card or two that you just can't make work, or worse, someone gets stuck with a bunch of stuff that they really have to force to fit. Overall I was surprised by how adaptable the cards were in a big group so it's not a [i]big[/i] problem, but it is kinda noticeable.

Update: My proudest moment in this game so far is when someone was looking for a model, so I did my best valley girl impression and used "Rapture" as my name (my parents are hippies), and said that I know modeling is about more than just looks, it's about self-discipline, which I prove that I have every day through my diet - I weigh myself against a "broomstick" every day and am [i]just under[/i].

The absolute greatest apples to apples style card game, with a wonderful balance of creativity and poor taste (without treading too far a la cards against humanity). What's more, there's much more potential for individuality and enjoyment here than most of its competitors. 
One warning: players who get less out of performance, improvisation, and creativity will not enjoy this game quite as much: COH does more of the work for you, whereas FunEmployed merely provides a truly wonderful tool box

I must say I quite enjoyed this game, and would love to see more cards out for it. My only play through was with my young niece and while she did an AMAZING job of putting together a resume, explaining cards to her was a headache. Overall, I see tons of potential for this party game.

Hilarious party game. We couldn't stop laughing. It would depend on the crowd. You need people who are creative and like really getting into their pitch. Not for children. The box says 13 and up but there are a large number of very adult cards. :-)

  Holy crap! Do I really have to tell my future employer ,who is looking to hire a (#catholic) priest , that I`m
secretly into S & M and that I have a sack full of candy with me?  (#We like to elaborate on the job specifications)

  Or when a boring accountant like myself starts gyrating
his hips in fictitious spandex yoga pants , while pretending to massage some Hollywood star , you know you`ve got a hit on your hands.

  This type of absurd situational role playing is guaranteed to make you break into laughter. But like all games of this type it has a relativly short longevity ,
unless you have lots of different play groups to test it
out on. Never the less we had a FUN-tastic time playing.

Houserule: In case of a tied situation , the employer would flip one random card from the deck for each player.
They would then have to include this in their CV. We call this the secret background check.
  IS THIS FAIR? Probably not! But if you care about winning or losing in this game , you shouldn`t be playing  this anyways.

RATING: 6.4
Such a silly party game - that I actually enjoyed. Granted there's not any strategy here, but a clever player can take wildly disparate "skills" to convince the "hiring manager" why they should get the job. 

Hilarity ensues. Seriously! I was surprised - we were laughing like crazy. As long as the players are all in for a good time, this game delivers.

A lot better than Cards against humanity. Involves more skill to BS your way through some cards. A lot more space to be imaginative. Even though you have ''bad'' cards, you can still have a decent interview, while in cards against humanity if you have bad cards, you won't go anywhere. I also have a variant on my own where you would not reveal the job and would just say clues about it. It says up to 20 but I don't think anyone would play this at 20 people. Better for less than 10 people an more than 4 people.

We play this where you play with normal rules (acting out a character is strongly encouraged) and at the end, the interviewer will ask one more question and the player must draw a card at random while they answer.

We also play that it's a quasi group-interview, so while every player still gets their turns, it's not uncommon for another player to make a snide comment here and there- don't let it get out of hand, but it does add some hilarity.

In Funemployed, each player has to sell their skills and talents and explain why one specific characteristic of theirs makes them the best candidate for the job. Each player gets a moment in the spotlight to essentially tell their best joke, revealing one card that states a qualification and how that qualification deserves them the job. As a shift from the mad-lib party game model, Funemployed is tremendously fun in its open-endedness. Pitches are easy to make and, more importantly, easy to make funny. The game does a good job of encouraging humorous anecdotes over outrageous-ness. As an approachable party game that induces laughter, Funemployed is one of the best.

Great party game for a witty, outgoing group. My only dislikes are that the box is a poor fit for the cards (room for the expansion, I guess?), it can make shy or reserved players uncomfortable, and that the single judge mechanic can be annoying (although the latter two issues can be fixed by letting a few players act as a hiring committee). I really enjoy letting the judge(s) ask the players questions even though that's not really in the rules.

We play with house rules, which are significantly simpler than the ones in the box. It's better if you play it as a pure improv game! Instead of having the trading phase, just give each person 4 cards face down and then they have to reveal them one at a time as they make their pitch. Revealing them blind is so much fun for everyone watching, and is a rush for the one trying to tie it all together.

Not as good with really big groups. I've recently played a couple of games with 8+ players, and it just diluted the experience. I think it's best played with 5 tops.

Initial Rating: 5.5 (April 2016)

In general terms, I HATE games like Apples to Apples and Cards Against Humanity, because they are too subjective for me. I thought Funemployed! was like this (and it is :shake:), but it was a blast to play.

The rules are very easy to understand (you can explain them under two minutes) and the game explainer said there are more ways of play. Still you can tell there is barely a game here, so in any game mode I guess the rules are very easy to learn.

As I wrote before, I dislike games in which a person is a judge and he subjectively chooses the best answer. It still bothers me in this game, but we had lots of fun playing it. Funemployed! Is VERY group dependent. Some of my friends wouldn’t like to role play you application for a job, but, fortunately, some of them do. It completely relies on improvisation and that’s MUCH better than Cards Against Humanity. 

Bottom line, the best game in its category, much better than expected. It is still too subjective for me (I prefer games with a defined scoring, like Time´s Up!) . I won’t buy it but I would play again if requested. It can be a good party game with the right crowd.

Game is a lot of fun. Format is pretty simple and it's a basic retread of apples to apples of CAH. But the point is, you need to be creative, and sell yourself to the employer to get them to pick you using 4 topic cards of your choosing. There's a communal pool that helps keep you from getting stuck. It's a mildly bipolar game, as you really need to play with people who can be creative, wacky and quick thinking.

This is a social/party game, of the Apples to Apples or Cards Against Humanity type. One person is hiring for a job (Pirate, Psychic, Game Show Host) and the others have cards they have to incorporate into their interview. My shining moment involved a simultaneous play of the cards "moist" and "cougars". It was a lot of fun and hilarious, but not the sort of game I look to play too often, so no buy for me.

Was told that this was the perfect game to buy if you love Cards Against Humanity but have exhausted it from overplaying, which I and the folks in my group certainly have done. It's actually quite a bit different, depending a lot less on serendipity and a lot more on the imaginations of the players. I wasn't overly impressed with the four-card-per-job mechanic, which seemed to me to introduce too much randomness to allow for the construction of really funny "interviews" that didn't descend into sloppy arbitrariness. But the students I was playing with (all 15-20 years younger than me) were crazy for it - they laughed like hyenas and played for over two hours straight. So the game is clearly getting something right.

A great party game that encourages creativity, accents, and laughs, either sober or with a moderate amount of alcohol.  The manual suggests you can change the rules around to scale with different numbers of people, which works well.  Your guests do have to improvise a little, so if people truly hate being on the spot, it could be tough, but in the extreme of that case they can let the cards speak for themselves.

You go through a LOT of the cards when you play, so the novelty factor of any one card is pretty short-lived.  You'll easily see them all if you play two games and actually move the cards around.  However, the fun is in the mix and match, not the individual cards!

I like improvisation and roleplaying, so this one's right up my apple cart. It's fun to watch folks who don't do a lot of either of those things loosen up and start feeding on the group's energy, and gameplay overall is a hoot. We laughed a lot, and the game does what it says on the tin.

As written, at least with six, it overstayed its welcome for us. It's a surprisingly draining game, albeit in a good way: You have to be "on" every couple minutes, which is great from an engagement perspective, and you're paying attention to how others are interviewing -- again, love the engagement. But being on like that is tiring.

Our energy level peaked, but we still had at least 20-30 minutes of gameplay left. We declared the next card to be My Job and wrapped it up. Next time out, I'd cut the number of jobs.

It also solves my least-favorite problem with games in the Apples to Apples family tree: dead hands. You use your whole hand every turn, and in a six-player game I had just one hand that didn't click for me. Part of that is the human factor: A lot of what makes an interview funny is what you bring to the table, how you deliver your pitch, and how surprising it is, and those things are largely independent of your hand.

Super-solid, lots of fun, and a great player count for parties. I like it a lot.

Is this superior to Cards against Humanity? Yes, it is, yet one cannot sit without the feeling of that the game feels tiresome to play over a longer time. This is the same problem that goes with any game that is driven by the players constructing stories: Your brain-energy isn't everlasting.

This is where Cards against Humanity is slightly superior simply because the answers were already written on the cards in your hand. Still for a short warm-up game this is suprisingly fun. Just don't play it for too long.

What a GAME!

Be sure to have the good group when you play the game. I've seen people backing off after a few turns, not being comfortable to play with the "best comedians" among us. They seemed to appreciate being spectator, though...

Funemployed is a difficult review for me. It should be great fun, I love creative games like balderdash, but for some people these games create to much pressure. Funemployed does this even more than balderdash by constraining people even more. For the right group this would be brilliant, for mine not so much, yet I enjoy it!

Fun variation of the CAH system.  Like the creative thinking needed to drive to turn lemons into lemonade during the interview phase.  Game would be rated higher, but some of my friends are not as creative and found this game challenging to come up with good twists on short notice.

A pretty fun social game: better than all the other apples-to-apples variants I've played (I'm speaking to you, Cards Against Humanity). Allows for more creativity. I played 'Snake Oil' once, and these were similar (if I remember correctly). Pretty fun when in the mood and/or with the right crowd!

Definitely like the variant where you can't look at your cards at all, and just flip them one at a time, making it a part of your interview.

I stripped the naughty cards out of the deck so we could play with a younger audience. At certain points my friend Greg had me laughing hysterically, he missed his calling as a comedian. But because of the younger children we had to play a more restrained game. Would love to try this again as an adults only game.

This has been a huge success for most of my varied friends who try it, gamers and non-gamers alike.

Like many 'storytellers', this isn't so much a game as an ice-breaker. It's success is very dependent on the players. It is fun with the right crowd but I could imagine it going down like a lead balloon with some groups.

​A party game very much in the mold of ​Snake Oil, but with the pitch being a job interview rather than selling a product. I had a better experience with it than I did with But Wait There's More, but it stressed me out somewhat (and I wasn't the only one). The combining of cards in Snake Oil allows for more creativity, whereas Funemployed was pretty much a case of acting out whatever trait was on the card. unemployed. ​​

Very fun Apples to Apples type game. It takes a lot more creativity than most similar games, with every player having to construct a funny or compelling story of why their cards fit the job opening the best. I really like how each player has four cards that they play as they lay out the story, putting a good element of comedic timing in. Being able to switch out your hand cards with the common cards in the middle of the table helps mitigate the problem where you just get a terrible hand of cards that you don't want to play. Overall, one of the very best of this type of game.

A great party game in the same vein as Cards Against Humanity, but a fun spin on the CAH formula.  Usually the drunker those playing become, the more outlandish and hilarious (and off color) the game turns.  Unfortunately, just like CAH, repeatedly playing the game yields diminishing returns.

RATING: 6.5
A significantly more hilarious variant on Cards Against Humanity.

Absolutely ideal for a light night with a group of tipsy friends.

Edit:
After playing for the umpteenth time, I have to say the card combinations don't quite ring with the same spark anymore.   I wish there were more expansions to keep this fresh.

Great party game that is only limited by creativity. Box design could be better... it's larger than it needs to be to fit the current cards, and not sized well to fit expansions (of which I hope there are many!)

RATING: 7
It's mostly yet-another-apples-to-apples-game but the real time element of preparing your hand, plus the requirement that you use your entire hand, are good additions to the genre.  It won't win you over to party comparison games, but if you already like such games you'll almost certainly enjoy this one.

With the right group, this is laugh-until-you-cry hilarity. Brilliant. 

With a group less willing to go crazy, it's still funny but some people just need a little more structure and less improv.

In the vein of a CAH or Apples to Apples where you have to use all your cards at once, but have the ability to swap cards with a central pool. Then you have to explain the meaning of what you assembled, which can be quite painful if it doesn't make any sense, as it often won't.

As card-swapping is a free-for-all, not taken in a turn order, it is an interesting challenge to have to think as quickly as possible to identify a coherent sales pitch (players being job applicants) among the available cards.

Maybe it's my own limited imagination but I felt like the two decks (the jobs and the qualifications) don't complement each other as well as they could. I felt like qualifications tended to be either negative traits, something sexual, or stuff that is irrelevant but also usually mundane. When a job is neither terrible (in which case people play negative traits claiming they are positive given the job) nor potentially sexual, like "astronaut," the round tends to be dull and nonsensical.

Party game that gets naughty quick. An Apples to Apples type of game. You present yourself as the best candidate for a job with 4 qualification cards. I find this easier to think of a story to group your cards together than Once Upon a Time.

Takes everything that's good about CAH, Apples to Apples, and Snake Oil, and creates one of the best party games I have ever played. Unlike the aformentioned game where players rely on cards to create the humor for them, being forced to use all 4 of your cards to complete your interview makes the players have to be creative on the spot, creating far more laughs than any other party game (except maybe Telestrations) has for my group.

Really fun, lightweight role-playing.

The basic mechanics of the game put this in the Apples to Apples / Cards Against Humanity family: you submit a set of four qualification cards as a "resume" for a job. However, this comparison is a bit misleading. The real emphasis (and fun) is on role-playing and *selling* your resume during the interview. Rather than just turning the cards over, you make a sales pitch to the interviewer, revealing them one at a time. Usually the winner is not the one with the best cards, but the one who made up the best (or funniest) sales pitch to fit the cards they have.

One thing that I found surprising is how easy this lightweight bit of role-playing comes, even to people I would have expected to struggle with it. The cards seem to provide just the right amount of focus/constraint needed to prod the creative juices without over-constraining them.

It's worth noting that many of the cards are a bit racy. This is not a problem for us in general, but we did skip over a few cards when playing with the in-laws. :-) Definitely nowhere near Cards Against Humanity, but not as kid/in-law friendly as Apples to Apples.

I bought Funemplyed hoping it would be a good replacement for Cards Against Humanity. I enjoy Cards Against Humanity, but you’re pretty limited in the groups you can play with and there are times where I’m just tired of its humor.

Funemployed it’s pretty similar to cards against Matt: you’re giving a hand up for cards that represent different traits, one person represents the employer and they draw a job card and pick the person that offers the best resume. The difference between Funemployed and for the Cards Against Humanity is that you must use all of your cards and there are 10 additional cards in the middle of the table that you can swap out the cards from your hand. Once everyone is happy with the four cards in their hand, they apply to the job one person at a time. This requires a lot more creativity than Cards Against Humanity: you have to take your four traits and convince the employer that you’re the best qualified.

However what makes this game unique also makes it difficult. Taking those for traits and concocting a resume on your feet is pretty difficult. That’s not to say it isn’t fun, it’s just harder and requires more brainpower than other games of it’s type. I’m interested to play it again, but I’m a little lukewarm on it right now.

Impromptu ad-lib party card game. Roleplay an interview by stringing together the random subject matter in your hand of cards. Energy and commitment of the group is the key to playing this game or it falls flat. I know my impromptu speaking muscles are out of shape because I am mentally exhausted after just a few rounds.

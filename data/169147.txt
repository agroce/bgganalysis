RATING: 5.5
It is a smart little idea: buy letters that pay off when your opponents use them. And it tries to balance things out by curtailing payoff for long words. But still, if you can make long words, you're going to win this game. I'm not a word game fan, but I'm searching for a word game that I like to play with my wife. Letter Tycoon isn't quite it.

RATING: 7.5
Fun word-building/economy game. Scrabble meets monopoly, I guess. The patent part of the game is awesome. I would guess this plays better with 3 players, but it works well as a 2-player game. Do not play with AP-prone people, though.

RATING: 7
It's pretty awesome for a word game but I definitely think dropping the three community cards and giving each player ten cards to make words from is the way to go. It's got some interesting mechanics and I'm happy to see games coming out that put the final nails in Scrabble's coffin. I reviewed this game for the GamesQuest blog. Personally, I like the artwork/thin theme of this game more than Paperback but Paperback is the better game. That's probably just because I prefer the deckbuilding mechanics in Paperback to Letter Tycoon's stock mechanics.

I played a four-player game of this and won in four turns.  I had perfect draws and claimed a high-dollar patent every turn, which got me enough 'dividends' that I was able to continue chaining them.  This felt amazingly broken to me.

Ten cards is one or two too many for balance; it makes it too easy for players with good vocabularies to outplay others, with no good catchup mechanisms to bring them back down.

RATING: 5
One play: The components are incredibly well designed and well made--superbly so. The core mechanics--forming words from your gardens of letters, and investing in letters that you earn income on--are compelling. But it's very hard to form words by rearranging the cards you're holding in your hand, as opposed to a stand as in Scrabble. There's not much player interaction, since royalties are paid by the bank and not by players themselves. The win conditions seem a bit arbitrary. It's a decent game, but doesn't make people eager to play again after finishing.

I love this game (that's why I bought it, duh). It is so satisfying to put together a word, sometimes without even using the special abilities, to get a ton of points (such as Quotas with the J power and with the Q doubling anyway)

Initially, when learning, we didn't realize that you could only buy patents for letters you played that round, which changes things up drastically.

The game is a lot of fun. You make words to earn money to buy letters to help you build larger words (and score even more money). The mechanic is unique and enjoyable and certainly in my top five word games. The letters give you special abilities, too.

The idea of a word game with some stock holding mechanism sounded wonderfully odd, but the execution just seemed not so great.

In the game, you can patent letters, which means you get paid every time that letter gets used in a word by another player. While a novel idea, this just led to a rich getting richer issue, where someone able to play long words early in the game, giving them the ability to buy better patents before the other players, is super beneficial.

On the flip side, there are also some wonderful and cheap patents for seldom used letters, that come with a helpful special ability. However, luck of the draw comes in big time here, as you can only buy a patent for a letter contained in the word you just played. So, you have to be lucky enough to draw a Z, and then play it in a word if you want the Z patent.

Another thing that seems cool at first is the idea of community cards that anyone can use on their turn. However, this mechanism just adds to downtime, as it means you really can't plan your words ahead of time. You'll often want to use the community cards, as they're 30% of the letters available to you each turn, but you can't count on any letter still being there when your turn rolls around. Downtime would be reduced drastically if players could just plan their words on other peoples' turns, and this mechanism makes that pretty tough.

Overall, a novel idea that is amazingly produced and illustrated, but it just fell flat for me even though I was excited about it.

I prefer a game like scrabble which is really a tile management and positional board game than a word-making game. The special tiles, and the shared tiles in the middle are all a bit much for me. Some of the special tiles feel overpowered - making 2 words, adding an s at the end, and whether you are eligible to get those in just luck of the draw.

RATING: 7
Nice twist on a word game in which players can 'invest' in letters that they've just used. The lesser used letters offer some good bonuses. The 'Y' for instance lets you add an 'S' on the end of a word. Very useful.

I really enjoy this game as a word game. It takes a nice medium between a heavy game of scrabble and mixes in economic concepts to speed the game up. The thing that's best about this game is the production quality and the design. The font is *okay* but the steampunk stylings and the wooden tokens are really nice to look at and hold in your hands. I also enjoy the linen finish on the cards and the balance to play with younger people and older and not have a huge disparity in points.

This is an average between my score (8) and my wife's score (10). I like that there is a competing desire between getting a long word and a word that uses a special patent letter.

I would have liked a smaller box (half size would have worked).

Wasn't terribly impressed. The players that spent the most time (and therefore found the most 7 letter words) came first and second. The rest of us mostly watched and waiting while that happened.

I was entertained that the tournament caliber Scrabble player lost, mostly because they kept trying to use weird letters instead of just make long words. Old habits die hard. I'm sure she would have been the best of us with a couple more plays.

Decent word game with two big problems.

1) The special powers are stapled on as a way to make rare letters worth buying. They feel like too much and too little of the game at the same time.

2) The scoring means you really want to use every card you can from your hand, even if somebody else has patented it. So instead of it being a game about outmaneuvering your competitors in a capitalist war, it's a game about being a consumer in late capitalism... you're complicit in your own oppression but you can't opt out of the system so that's just how it's going to be.

A solid word-building game, with an economic aspect to keep it interesting. You make words to get money, then spend that money on "letter patents." After you buy these, you'll get a monetary reward every time somebody else uses that letter for the rest of the game. Simple but fun if you like this kind of thing, which I do. In this vein, Buyword and Paperback are also good.

=======
I think my group does this game a disservice by playing with 5 people every time. The downtime is maddening, and since there are communal letters that you may not get, you can't really work on your own word until your turn. My desire to play it is really falling, but I'd still like to try with just two or three.

Read the rules. Would like to play sometime.

You have a hand of cards with letters and some free-to-use letters on the table. Make a word on your turn, score points.

Now after you've created your word, you can buy a "patent" on one of the letters you used in a word this turn (assuming no one else has bought that patent). In the future when someone uses that letter in a word, you get a dollar from the bank because of your patent.

Seems like it would appeal to Scrabble-lovers. Also seems quicker.

I think that this is the best "word game" I have ever played.  It's not just about scoring the most point-scoring word--the addition of letters with special abilities, seemingly insignificant stocks that pay off later, and scoring free money off your letter patents adds so much depth to such a simple game concept.  My 7-year-old loves this game.

Good word games!  (Some of you don't believe they exist.)  I was so impressed when I first played Paperback, because it was such a great word game for the modern day!  Here we are only a year later and there is ANOTHER great word game!  :-D  I absolutely love this game!  It happily lives in my collection right next to Paperback, so don't feel that you have to choose because there are enough differences between them. The letter patents definitely change up strategy when you are building your words.  Do you want to give money to your opponent by using those letters he owns?  Dilemas!  heh  The special patents give you powers, which can really swing the game, so grab them when you can!  Excellent game, and is already one of my favorites from 2015!  :-)

Oh... and I got a little golden zeppelin piece with my copy of the game (in addition to the regular black one in the game).  These were offered to those who pre-ordered (me) the game or played in their 2015 tournament.  :-)  A nice little extra.

Letter Tycoon is the word game for 2-5 capitalists!

In the game, players take turns forming a word using a seven-card hand and a three-card community card pool, scoring money and stock rewards based on their word. Players may use their earned money to buy one letter "patent" in the word they make. In the future, whenever another player uses one of your owned letters on their turn, you earn money from the bank. Letters that are used less frequently have special abilities, increasing their power.

When enough of the alphabet has been claimed, players finish the current turn, then score all money, stock and letter patents owned. Create the most valuable empire and you can become the letter tycoon!

Word game.  Interesting in that, unlike Scrabble and similar games, you're not rewarded for using uncommon letters.  Instead, you have a lower likelihood of future rewards for those uncommon letters, if you buy the patent for them.  Moves at a pretty good pace and doesn't outstay its welcome.

RATING: 6
Scrabble with cards. Buy "patents" for letters so that you get residual payments when other players play words with letters you own. Word payouts are based strictly on length, not letter rarity, which seems to be a significant misstep.

Pre-planning a turn is difficult (there are letters available in the middle of the table for any player to use, but they're replaced when used) so turns are pretty slow, even for a Scrabble-type game.

I absolutely love this game, and I'm not a huge fan of word games.  The artwork is fantastic and it seems very well balanced.  I also like that there is a mechanic that keeps people from running away with the game completely.  This is done by issuing stocks which act as money that can't be spent.  This way one big-word speller can't just go on a spending spree every turn.  

My average game takes about 45 minutes.  We usually have 4 or 5 players.  There is an element of time for each person's turn because community cards constantly change so it's not a speed game.  I do like this though because it keeps you on your toes, and there's something great about dying for a letter to come up by the time it gets to your turn.  Also it's amazing when a needed letter gets pulled away from someone just before it's their turn.  Heartbreaking but exhilarating.  The first time you spell a 10 letter word it makes all the anticipation worth it.

With a couple of plays under my belt this is currently sitting at "very fun with caveats." I feel like it's a touch too long, but the length is probably necessary in order to get the appropriate mileage out of the buying of patents, the game's hallmark mechanic. The ending so far seems obvious as well- the person with the required $ amount of patents has been the winner in every game so far. But it's been a hit in every group so far and the presentation is gorgeous.

I'd like to like this one a lot more because it's one of the most beautiful games I've encountered in the past year--first-rate graphic design, a very nice feel to the components (the 1 and 3 buck chips are quite substantial!). The gameplay is fine, but just nothing special. My major caveat is that because the three cards in the centre get used up and replenished very rapidly, there's no point in planning ahead to use them--so there's no long-term strategy in this game. I'm also not a fan of light social games which frequently stop in their tracks for that dread question: "Is that really a word?"

Feels like a nice middle ground between Scrabble and Word on the Street. It's more relaxed than Word on the Street, but doesn't have the decision space I appreciate about Scrabble. Overall, this is a pretty pedestrian word game. The idea behind the shares is interesting, and the special abilities add a little spice to the formula, but otherwise this is a game where the person with the better vocabulary is usually going to win. I don't mind this game, but I would much rather play Scrabble. Paperback is still my favorite word game overall, and this doesn't come anywhere close to unseating it.

A fun game where you make words and the more letters your word has the more money and stocks you can claim. Once you complete a word you will have the option to buy a patent in a letter of your choice from the word you just made. If your opponent makes a word with any of your patented letters, you will make a dollar for every use of that letter in their words for the rest of the game.

Making words comes from your hand of 7 cards and the 3 cards open to all players. Once you use a community letter, it will be discarded and replaced. Excellent game that has very little rules, simple to play and pretty relaxing all in all.

Letter Tycoon is a card-based word building game. On a player's turn, he builds the longest word he can out of his hand as well as a small pool of common letters. Letters don't have varying values in this game; words score based on their length alone. Once the reward is received, that player has the option of buying the "patent" for a letter they used. Any future uses of that letter will earn the patent-holder $1 from the bank. Additionally, patents for several difficult-to-use letters grant that player special powers even when that letter isn't used. Personally, I found this game very bland and lacking in decision points. Letters being worth the same and the paucity of special powers encouraged players just to make the best word they could and then take whatever patent.

RATING: N/A
Novel word game, but the central pool of additional letters is ill thought out. My solution is to keep the central letters unchanged for a full round. This very dramatically speeds up the game because players can plan their word in advance of their turn. The first player has the disadvantage of less time to plan. I'd argue that that evens out because the first player zeppelin should move around at the end of each turn.

My next modification is to change up the game so that it is the user rather than the bank who pays for patent use. You can't just give players ordinary starting cash for this because that would unbalance the game by making it too easy to buy up the vowel patents. Already the game has a second 'currency' in the form of the stocks, so maybe the answer is to give players starting stocks and specify that stocks can be used to pay for patent use but cannot ever be used to buy new patents.

I got to play this game at my local meetup today. 

If you are a fan of word games this one will feel familiar to you. It has two mechanisms in this game. 

1) Be the best guy that knows how to spell long words.

2) Manage your letter bonuses and try to get as much money as possible.

I am horrible with word games but I had fun today.

Fast letter/word power game which ends too soon at higher player counts. The common pool of letters can lead to downtime if it changes before a player's turn, so we set three letters out for each complete round, and another three nearby for the next round. Two player works well and forces you to pay attention the other player's patents.

A really unique mix of word building with Stock like properties some of which actual have special powers to bend the rules.  Played two player and we each had completely different strategies one with long extensive word building while the other used short words but acquired double income for them via special powers and the end scoring was very close.  I'm not a huge word game guy but there is more to this game than just building words.

What an amazing surprise! This is one of our favorite word games, and we've tried them all. It's the best parts of Dabble, Word Thief, and Word On The Street without all the draggy parts. Plays well at all player counts and wow... Is it ever fun.

An accessible but skill-based word game.  There are lots of ways to avoid bad situations, making the game less frustrating for weak players but still advantaging good word-forming skills.  There are also special powers, investment tradeoffs, and a nice anti-snowballing mechanic that doesn't punish early progress (stocks reward very long words and are worth points but not liquid cash).

I'd definitely rather play this than Scrabble.  It still gives you a lot of satisfaction in making long words, and the additional strategic layer of buying stock in letters is not complicated at all.  I don't think I'd play this with more than 3.

1 play, partial game

A very good word game mixed with some economics. Good, but with a few (fatal?) flaws all of which are related to the public cards. In a game this thinky, being screwed by having crappy cards flip for you, or seeing someone else get a exactly what they needed just come up (after the previous player's turn) is ANNOYING. And the fact that those public cards change so often means that you can do little or no planning, especially in games with a large player count! It sure seems that part of the game needs some tweaking! 

Maybe a variant as simple as this would do the trick:
- At the start of the game, place 6 cards on display, in 2 rows of 3: CURRENT and FUTURE.
- During a round, players may only use the CURRENT public cards. Players score normally but these are _not_ discarded when used.
- At the end of the round, discard all 3 CURRENT cards, FUTURE becomes CURRENT, and you place 3 new FUTURE cards on display.
You can plan, maybe even two turns out -- the game should fly by! Earlier players do have a bit of an advantage: they can buy stock in those CURRENT letters and get some money back as others use them this round. But you could compensate by giving people later in turn order an extra $1 at the start of the game. Sure, the variant needs testing, but it seems as if the game needs some kind of change! 

Or maybe increase hand size and limit use of the public cards (max 1), so it's easier to make words from your own cards and there's less change in the display?

Or some other variant?

[b]--- Rules Summary ---[/b]
A display of 26 patent cards, one per letter, is placed on the table. Each card has a cost in $, and a VP value (for end of game) The rarest letters have a special power. A deck of letter cards is shuffled; deal 7/player. Also place 3 letter cards out face up in a public display.

On your turn, use your letters and/or the public letters to create a word (Scrabble rules). Earn money (and possibly VP certificate) according to a table, more letters is better. You may use money immediately to buy an available patent card for one of the letters in your word. In the future, earn $1 every time another player uses that letter. The patent may also give you a special power (eg, use a letter card twice in your word, or add an 's' to your word). The game ends as soon as someone's patent VP totals to 40(?) or more; most VP wins.

Solid word game that I really enjoy, despite not usually enjoying word games. The box is too large though, and I am considering replacing the box with something more appropriate for the contents inside

Excellent word game! I would play with a house rule that you can't stack a doubler ability on top of a doubler on a turn, otherwise the payout is just too large. An exception would be made only for the use of the Q, because of its difficulty in using.

RATING: 5.5
Hype kinda hurt this one for me. It certainly has an interesting hook with investments in letters, and some ideas here are great, just not implemented 100%. For example, it's cool that infrequently used letter patents have special abilities. But they are wildly variable in power, one being especially OP. And the basic mechanic of how letters are drawn each turn to form a common pool just adds too much downtime. And in close games there can be kingmaker situations because of points from letter patents.

With a few house rules, this game could sing. It's already inviting and easy to learn, and while it isn't the best word game, nor does it fix the common problems with word games, it's still enjoyable and the game length is just right.

While the core of the game is something you've seen before - make a long word out of a bunch of scrambled letters - the idea of "owning" letters to make them less attractive for your opponents is brilliant. I also like how difficult letters don't directly give you more points, a la Scrabble, but instead give you access to rare special powers.

I like Paperback better as a word game, but this game has a very light economic aspect which adds a bit the genre. It also makes sure the good only get gooder ;)

The artwork, wooden chips, and little zeppelin all look great.

Slightly more involved Scrabble. May be more fun with really competitive players? Otherwise, it seems really easy to win. Just get the consonants that give you special powers and kill the game.

Scrabble variant in the cutthroat world of business. Build words from your refilled hand and using the three card pool for money to buy stock, earn royalties for your patents, buy letter stocks, patent letters that gain increasingly special powers or scoring values using less common letters. Our house is notorious for AP with word games.

[b]First edition note:[/b] The intense epoxy fumes from the box are torturous, especially if you have a sensitive nose. Air that sucker out, and hope for the best.

Now, as for the game itself, I really like it. It is right up my alley. The only flaw is that the "hold 'em" 3 face-up cards in the middle lead to a lot of downtime. You can't be sure what 30% of your "hand" will be until your turn comes around. Try the following downtime-killing variants to see which works for you:

[b]10-Card Stud[/b] Each player just gets 10 cards in their hand, instead of 7. There are no shared cards in the center.

[b]Card Conveyor[/b] The middle of the table has 2 more cards than the number of players (2p: 4; 5p: 7), but only the left 3 are available for the current player. Using them does [b]not[/b] discard them. Instead, after each player's turn, the leftmost card gets discarded, the others shift left, and a new card comes out to fill the gap on the right. This way, each player can always start plan her next turn as soon as she finishes her current one.

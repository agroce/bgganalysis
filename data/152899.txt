GAME: Pixel Tactics 3
RANK: 1965
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
[I]tl;dr - the battle tactics of moving guys back and forward seems interesting and unique, I just couldn't find an audience for such a narrowly focused two-player game. Nothing against the game itself, though -- it could be for you![/I]
[COLOR=#CCCCFF]____________________________[/COLOR]

Pixel Tactics is an interesting game but ultimately one I couldn't keep due to it being two-player only. In short, you and your opponent are playing troops on a field of nine squares and attempting to skirmish and attack one another to get at each other's leader, which will sit in the center of the nine-square grid. 

It's a fun game, but I gave it to my brother after a few plays since he has a lot more opportunity for two-player games.

I've played twice. I thought this would be the game for me, but it's just alright. I'm excited for when I don't need to read everything. Sometimes you have deadly combos, other times you are struggling to know what to do.

Another standalone Pixel Tactics box, 25 new characters you can either mix up with the earlier sets or play with exclusively. Also there are some new game modes in here, so I'd say it was slightly more important than Pixel Tactics 2, but just buy them all...this system is a blast to play.

We also played 2 games of PT 3, going against the PT 2 deck as well as the base game set. I think I like this set a little more than PT 2, but it is close. The Hero as well as the Leader abilities seem more interesting. They also fine tuned the Ongoing effect cards from PT 2. Now, they are in effect for 3 Waves and you rotate the card 90 degrees after each Wave to track it. That works well. I don't think I will get anymore Pixel Tactics sets, but I think I will have many more battles just with the base set and the 2 add-ons.

Favorite Cards:

1. Golem
2. Brawler
3. General

This game hurts my face with all the small text, pixelated art, and rainbows on every card.  Yeck!  The box ripped the first time I tried to pack everything back in it - I cant get everything to fit.  The gameplay is good.  It's exactly what I expected based on the reviews and comments other people have made.  I didn't expect the whole package to be so annoying though.  Maybe I'm just having a high blood pressure day...

I knew I was taking a chance when I bought this game.  I love tactical games, but I generally don't like games with tons of text especially when you're reading that text on a rainbow of loud colors.  I guess what I've found out about myself is that aesthetic displeasure trumps good gameplay.  Neat!

First Impressions: 8+. An underrated game. I enjoyed this way better than Summoner Wars and the boy liked PT3 (which surprised me as he dislikes Mage Wars; though he enjoys MtG). I'm looking forward to playing Pixel Tactics and PT2.

Cards were of good quality. The 8-bit art is cute; take it or leave it. A lot of gameplay in a small, inexpensive package. We didn't use the paper player mat on the other side if the side  rules; it wasn't necessary.

Really really really tried to like this one. It has a very appealing look with retro pictures and rpg-style gameplay. Infortunately the gameplay is broken and simply doesn't flow well.

All the cards have tons of little text and special abilities. This makes it very hard to keep up with your own stats when you have 9 cards on the table and each of them raise your HP/defences/fighting power. In our plays we were constantly doing calculations and kept writing things down on a piece of paper just to understand our own cards. Still we had to go all "wait I didn't notice that this card here gives the forerunner more HP". 

And if you are unable to follow your own cards, you can imagine how difficult it is to follow your opponent's. The text is tiny so you have to keep asking what each of his cards do just to know who you should attack. And once you've performed an attack he goes "wait, the guy behind him gives him extra HP and my boss gives extra defences" simply due to the difficulty of keeping up with all of his stats. The only way I can see the gameplay working is if both players know their cards by heart.

Then there's the issue of a broken game system. For instance, choosing Gaspar Geddon as your boss gives you the possibility to prevent all damage to units by discarding a card. You can protect him with Golem who prevents your opponents from doing any ranged attacks to any other character. Melee attacks attack any first card but ranged attacks can pass cards. However with this combo your opponent never gets to touch your boss since he can only attack Golem who can be kept forever alive by discarding cards. Unfortunately this game is full of frustrating combos such as this one.

Again, this is more of the "same." However, when a concept is this good, clean, simple, and fun, you don't mess with the formula. This does what a stand-alone expansion should do: add content without adding additional overhead rules. While I don't think that this deck would be an ideal starting place, it's a great place to freshen things up: the characters, as Talton stated in an interview, are all about tableau interaction in this one. This means cards with effects that support other characters with stat boosts (either defense, offense, additional life, other effects such as invulnerability to instant death attacks). Accordingly this is a great addition to the mix as it can be useful in developing a whole new range of strategies on the fly. The only complaint is that heroes who use cards as a currency (either become stronger through burning cards, or are weaker because they help you preserve your deck) are especially unbalanced in the draft mode (my preferred way to play) this time around (but should be well-enough balanced in individual deck mode, constructed or pre-constructed). Overall though, another great iteration of a great game. Always look forward to what's in stock for us in terms of Pixel Tactics.

Pixel Tactics 3 can be played as a standalone game or used to expand previous Pixel Tactics games. It also comes with new play modes such as Epic Constructed (60-card decks), Cube Draft, and more that you can access by combining all three Pixel Tactics games (plus any mini-expansions)! Pixel Tactics 3 contains 25 new heroes.

So far the weakest version of Pixel Tactics that I've tried. There are some permanent effects that change the game dramatically but can't be cancelled (at least I didn't find out yet).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
A lot of strategy in a minimal number of rules and cards that can lead to some very close games. Better balanced than its predecessors. 
The positional element + shifting abilities really invoke the feeling of the old console games this obviously draws inspiration from.
VERY cheap to get into; PT3 is currently the cheapest "starter pack for 2 people to play a complete CCG" that I know of. You know what you're getting in the expansions, too.

This is just Pixel Tactics with new decks of cards.  The only difference is some of the order effects are ongoing so they last for a whole wave, round, or even game after being played, this was introduced in Pixel Tactics 2.

If you like Pixel Tactics this is a great thing to have since you can shuffle the two decks together for even more variety.

Maybe just a bit too long, and certainly would be better if the visuals were improved (sure, pixels, but, well, better pixels) and if the cards were easier to read (small text means you need to play may games before not having to stop and pick up your opponent's cards).

But don't get me wrong: I think this series is excellent and PT3 is my favorite small box.

I'll probably end up rating this higher in the future, but right now the game's major failing is that its hard to get other people to play it with me. The wall of text on every card seems to turn people away. Its a good game and not overly complicated, but that aspect just seems to keep it from ever hitting the table.

Think Final Fantasy Tactics, but in the form of cards and unique characters from Level 99. Easy to learn, yet has a complex system with many strategies to utilize. Each character has their own abilities and can be used in many ways. Quite a good dueler.

Strategic game that relies way too much on intensive text on smallish cards, with text facing in both directions, resulting in double-checking and triple-checking and quadruple-checking cards for yourself or your opponent, depending on what effect you are using in that time and place. Frustrating experience overall.

Twilight has a very irritating misprint, which raises the threshold to start playing this game a little too high. Fortunately the new version fixes the issue, but I still have not gotten it to the table :)

A very strange partnership trick-taker.  Unusual features include the ability to nominate another player to play a card on your behalf and that the valuable cards are also the least powerful.  I am intrigued and still struggling to play it well.

I like this bizarre card game (trying playing just this and Dia de los Muertos all night), but it has a fairly large lerning curve and is definitely not for everyone.  (I prefer Muertos)

Oh, of the tricky trick-taking games I have, this might be the trickiest. Cards that don't outrank each other, variable numbers of points, multipliers, asking other people to play a card into a trick for you. About enough to make your head asplode.

I'm not saying it wasn't fun, mind.

Interesting trick taking game that takes a bit to get your head round.  Deciding when your opponents should play for you, and which one of them should do so, is key to the game but completely anathema to someone brought up on standard trick taking games.  Needs further play to determine whether I really do like it or not.

This is a great game for people that want to take the time to learn to play it!  We played the original version of "Twilight" every day at lunch for over a year.  What a great experience to fully understand this game.  There were some problems with the original printing as far as typos and such that have been fixed in the retheming.  One big mistake, however, is that the card backs are still not different enough to stand out.  It was a problem with the original and it's still a problem.  I sleeve the cards in two very different colored sleeves so it is obvious who is holding which cards.

RATING: 8
I really enjoy this game.  I love the deduction element of trying to figure out which of your team's cards your opponents have.  Unfortunately nobody in my family or gaming groups like it, so I never get to play!  Most complain that it is either a) too difficult or b) too random.  It is neither of these things, but you do have to put some effort into tracking cards or it will feel random to you.

I love this game just because it's *so* wierd; anything so utterly unique keeps it's spot in my collection (Twilight scored bonus points too for doing so while basically being a trick-taking game with a reasonable attempt at theme). It's too wierd for any of my regular players, though.

I played the version of this themed Jekyll and Hyde.  I liked the theme, but it was sometimes confusing to distinguish the two types of cards (the differences on the card faces are relatively subtle).  The number of cards in the deck is tiny, and it can take some time to deduce what cards are being held by one's partner and what cards are being held by the opponents.

A good, yet very bizarre trick-taking game that benefits from great art, a threadbare but interesting theme that actually informs the mechanics, and some unusual twists.

A partners trick-taking game with strategy unlike any I've ever seen; having some of your opponents' cards in hand and choosing other players to play cards for you results in some fascinating dynamics, and more opportunities for cooperation between partners than in many paired games I've seen. Each hand is fast, and a short game can easily be just 2-3 hands.

RATING: 9
Components: (Jekyll & Hyde edition) Artwork that is not particularly pleasant to look at, but is well done and evokes a sort of subdued violence, appropriate for the theme. The cards are of acceptable quality, though not as nice as they could be. There are only 30 cards in the entire game, so having such an oversized box is silly. The numbers are, at times, difficult to read from a distance.

Experience: This is a tough game to wrap my brain around. First, I must figure out the rankings of the cards, and how some win tricks, and others win points. Second, I must figure out when to call on others to play on my behalf, and upon whom to call. One of the more mind-bending trick-taking games I've played. I'm impressed that such an interesting system has been built from half the number of cards typical in other card games. The low number of cards works to the game's advantage, as the cards are countable: whereas the first few plays from another player's hand involve mere guesswork, over the course of the seven tricks I become more and more certain of what each player holds, and is able to play (or request play) accordingly.

Strange trick taking game where players pair up as either dark or light, and try to take soul points.  The weird quirk in this game is the cards have two different backs, so you can see what everyone is holding, and you can ask an opponent to play a card for you!  As I said, strange, and even stranger is the game works.  Reprinted as Jekyll and Hyde.

Very nice trick-taking game for freaks, manages to create a lot of thinking about what card to play with an astonishingly small number of cards. The "Jekyll" version has very nice card graphics, although the suit numbering is printed rather small. Good companion game to the similarly styled but differently playing "Flaschenteufel".

I love the way the relatively simple rules in this game leave people scratching their heads in total confusion halfway through the first hand!

Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hide version. Lot of strategy in this one. It's a partner game and it's designed in a way that there is a lot to be learned from your partner's play. It's a really unique mechanism and it works quite well, although it plays a little bit more slowly than usual card game. I really want to play that again soon. Theme doesn't fit as well as Flaschenteufel though.

A bizarre and insidious partnership trick-taking game in which one player can force another to play a card on his behalf.  It's really, really weird stuff. I like weird, but in this case we never played the game enough to figure out how to command the system in an intelligent way. So what we got was mostly chaos. There may be some subtle depth lurking here if you take the time to grok the game . . . or maybe not.

One play with four. "Bizarro trick-taking." I was worried that this one would be just too weird and difficult, but I ended up liking it. It really requires players who are adept at trick-taking games, though. The bizarre bit is that you can (sometimes must) ask other people to play cards on your behalf. What's interesting about that is that you're sort of involved with the other players' hands in a way, and it requires a certain amount of deduction and intuition. The down side is that I sometimes felt like things were a little too unpredictable.

First played December 5th, 2007. This takes ~5 min to teach and <1hr to play for 4 players. This twisted trick-taking game is unique I'll say. There is some strait-forward strategy in this as well as decent amount of luck (or so it seems). You play in partners with a hand of 7 cards. Each team has it's own cards that part of the deck, dealt out randomly. Each team's cards have the same number and power. A1,B1,C1,D1,E1,F3,F4,F5,F6,F7,x1,x2,x3 and a transformation card. The higher (A) is the highest card. Highest card played takes each trick unless a transformation (xform) card is played. All x's have the same power as well as the F's. The first card played takes the trick if two are played. I.e. A1,A1. When xform is played, the hand is set aside and another hand is played. If the other xform is played, a 3rd hand is played. Whoever takes the trick takes the previous tricks unclaimed. Scoring is the # on the card. x's of your own team cards multiply your score. I.e. x2 multiplies your score by 2. Playe to 1,000. It's worth a gameplay if you know someone with it, otherwise I wouldn't bother with purchase.

An utterly unique game that is sure to leave you wondering what exactly you're supposed to be doing until you've played a couple of rounds.  Like the other Bambus trick-taker (Flaschenteufel), the theme is surprisingly well fitting given the abstract nature of a trick taking game.  I hope I'm able to play this often enough that I don't completely forget the game.  I bet that with all experienced players it would be a pretty cool experience.

RATING: 5
I like partnership games and this one is a quite good trick-taking game in that category. I like it, but it has some minor problems. The first one is, that it takes some time to "learn" the cards (which one is better than the other). The bigger problem is, that the scoring system sucks (you need x3 card if you want to get big points) AND maybe there should be more cards too? It might be nice to play this more often and with experienced players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Played once, 4 players.  This game was an interesting take on trick taking games, but ultimately too much of a guessing game.  Too often, you're not in control of your own game since you need your opponents to play your tricks for you.  There must be some strategy buried in the game that is opaque to me, though, since the same team won 4 out of 5 hands, so it might be worth digging deeper for some players.  Not for me, though...

The most interesting part of Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde is having other players, wether in your team or not, play in your place. Considering that the opposing team can only play one type of cards and that multiplicators are also type influenced, it quickly gives rise to complex tactical decisions.
If you like trick taking games, you should definitly give this one a try.

Having other players play your cards is a nice twist, but since a trick-taking game for exactly four players (I'm dubious about the proposed 3-player rule) has to compete with Njet, Dia de los Muertos, Tichu etc., this will not get a lot of showtime.

A different kind of trick taking game. You get a hand of cards, but you can only play cards for yourself if they match who you are. Otherwise, you have to have someone else play a card in front of you. The scoring is a bit extreme since you get the values of cards times whatever multipliers you collect (1-6x), so scores can vary wildly.

The ability to call on other players to play on your behalf is the mechanic that sets this game apart from others. There's only 28 cards to count (which you‚Äôll need to do), but this game is really, really hard to play well and determine best moves. Which means it plays slowly. This, and the fact it's maybe too hard, means it never hits the table enough for you to actually get on top of it. Still, it‚Äôs a brain bender for when you're looking for one.

A very interesting and well themed card game. You play either Dr. Jekyll or Mr. Hyde and you play in teams. You must win the trick by playing the highest card, yet you can ask any other player to play for you. The strategy is hard to come by at first, but once you get to know the cards, which there are not that many different ones and a few important ones, the strategy becomes very interesting. A pleasant surprise.

Owned an unplayed Jekyll & Hyde version, but passed on as I realised the scoring is too mathematical for me and the mindset of my gaming environment. Finally got to play this trick taking novelty, in which half the deck belongs to the opposing partnership. This often makes for a tense situation of not wanting to be asked to play by an opponent or your partner (once the hierachy of the cards is internalised). But this quirky gameplay sometimes means a player will play more than once in a round, resulting in downtime for others or having no cards to play at all towards the end of a hand. Also there seems to be alot of luck involved for a game which provokes alot of thought. Still an interesting problem solving diversion and I like the bold artwork.

Anyone who knows me knows that I'm a sucker for tricktakers with a twist. And Twilight (aka Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde) is one of the twistiest I've tried yet. It's a partnership game with a tiny deck, marked on the back for which team they 'belong' to. The big twist is that instead of playing a card when its your turn, you can demand another player (partner or opponent) do so on your behalf. Delightful.

RATING: 9
Most tense card game, period!

The deck contains only 28 cards, 14 cards in each suit. You can identify the suit of each card by looking at its back.

It's a four player, fixed partnership game, partners sit across from each other. Partners must play cards from their assigned suit (Dr. Jekyll or Mr. Hyde) throughout the entire game. However, players may ask any other play to play a card on his or her behalf.

There's a lot of push-your-luck in this game. One tactic is to drain an opponent of cards of your team's suit, hoping that you'll able to force him to play a good card on your behalf. Of course, this could really backfire on you.

Another level of push-your-luck is in the Transformation cards, the highest card of each suit. Playing one gives you the lead for the next trick, but does not give you the trick ... the winner of the next trick wins both tricks. So it's often a big gamble when you play a Transformation card; timing is essential when playing it!

December 2011: Upgrade to 9.

This is the tensest card game ever. There's an insidious push-your-luck element in this game. One tactic is to make an opposing player play all of his cards of your own suit, hoping that he'll be forced to play a good card on your behalf.

In addition, the transformation cards add another push-your-luck element. Playing one is a gamble that you could win the current trick and the next. However, if you lose the next trick, you lose both!

May 2010: Rated it a 7.5 after only one hand

Weird trick-taking, partnership card game in which you're allowed to request other players to play their cards for you. Only after an experienced player guided us on an "explanatory" session, going so far as to show which cards were better to play at each juncture, did we begin to grasp the whole picture. Still, it appears to be much too random to reward repeated play.

Very nice trick-taking game.  Play is reasonably straight-forward, but where it shines is in the opportunity for communication between partners. Highly recommended.

Very interesting partnership trick taking game.  Only two suits and each partnership can only play one of them!  Nice artwork.

--Jul2009-- Delightfully brain-melting partnership game.  I'm not at all sure how often I can get it to the table, but I'll be happy when it makes it.  Fortunately the folk at work were also amused!

Great, great trick taking game... Concentration is required to take in all the hints and to guess and track the location of the powerful cards, but victory is rewarding! Unfortunately, it only plays with exactly 4... and beginners often stay clear of it after the first game, fearing the complexity. And I don't like the artwork very much, either.

This is a very elegant trick taking game.  The cards are well-balanced, and the game play is unusual and fun.  The downsides are that this game is really only for exactly 4 people, and the artwork is pretty bad.  The gameplay is quick, requires strategy and is fun.  There are very few games out there that have the cost value that this one has.

A trick taking game with a twist in the vein of Bambus's Flaschenteufel. There are only 28 cards (multipliers 1, 2, 3, A1, B1, C1, D1, E1, * and F3-7)  and it plays best with 4 (7 tricks). Each team takes either the Jekyll or Hyde side and mus play cards in their suit. They can choose to ask an opponent to play a card for them instead of playing one for themselves. The backs of the cards are split into the two sides and players can the makeup of each player's hand.

After all the tricks are resolved, players score points by adding up the scores on the cards wons and multiplying with the the corresponding multipliers won. If a team wins no multipliers, they don't score.

Own Twilight version. 230306.

Complete non-sense card game. I have yet to see a game which isn't decided by luck of the draw. This game isn't bizarre, strange or weird, it's crap.

RATING: 7
In the first couple rounds of play this game feels completely arbitrary and random.  As the game progresses it starts to open itself up and expose some deeper decisions and strategies.  Overall, I don't think that it offers as much as some of the more intricate card games out there, but I do feel that there is quite a bit of game here for many future playings.  After delving into this, you really get to see what this game offers.  A nice medium weight filler.  I play to 668 points the neighbor of the beast.

One of my favorite partnership games and in my top 3 trick taking games. Scoring is a bit weird and sometimes seems unbalanced but the game compensates with one of the most original play option where you can ask a partner or opponent to play for you revealing bits of info.

There are tons of trick-taking games out there, yet it still manages to offer a unique twist on that genre.  The transformation cards, multipliers, and ability to ask others to play for you are all interesting concepts.

[Bambus Spieleverlag 'Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde' 2002 edition] {Novel; trick-taking, partnership; optimal 4p}  J&H is a unique and nice trick-taking game, in which players can 'appoint' another player to play a card for him. Therefore, players have to calculate what cards the opponents and his partner are holding. It is not trivial to convey information to your partners; it needs a few games to understand how to piggyback information at each choice and cards.

J&H is fun and engaging. It's a hardcore trick-taking game, which is most suitable for gamers or experienced trick-taking players.

The illustration may be too dark. Similar to Bottle Imp, the game comes with a short booklet about the story. It's good!

[Variant] I haven't tried the "B" card.

Very good game. There is much to consider on your turn- do I play a card, and if so, which one? Or do I ask someone else, and who? If you enjoy trick-taking games, it is highly recommended.

Two mechanics I really like: Making others play for you (adds a wealth of interesting tactical options) and the multiplier cards (makes a few must-win cards). I've only played this once, but we had a great time. It's a shame you can only play with four, cuts down on the opportunities.

An interesting little game, finally tried one but will take many more to get a good feel for this game.  Unusual mechanic in asking other players to play your card! Cool theme based on literature, if loosely. Would like to play more of this. It has a scoring mechanism that somehow reminds me of Gargon (unusual to have useful information on the back of the cards). My friends don't like 4 player partnership games so it probably won't come out much.

I really wanted to like this game, because I like trick-taking games, and I like the wonky variations folks come up with to add to the theme.  This one, though, seemed far too limiting.  It was too chaotic, with other players playing cards for you, and it seemed hard to control how a trick developed.  It might improve with more plays, but I would much rather play Sticheln or Die Sieben Siegel instead.

Seems like a very good partnership trick-taking game but it probably won't come out again because one of my friends refusing to play based on the card artwork.  Would be nice if there was a nicer version of this out (artwork is nice looking but awful from a design POV).

I am fascinated by this game.  It is so original that I still don&#039;t know when to play and when to have someone play for me.  I enjoy a good puzzle.  BTW, my initial reaction when I opened the box was &quot;where&#039;s the game?&quot;  Don&#039;t worry, it may be small but it packs a wallop.

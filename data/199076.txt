One of my favorite miniature games of all time got a bit cleaner, and the future is pretty bright for it.

RATING: N/A
So far I really enjoy this. The huge influence of warcasters on the flavor of the army makes the game feel more nimble than warhammer 40k.

My first tabletop miniatures game. Fun game but Guildball just replaced it for me.

RATING: 7
Still a solid game, with much more being viable now. Seems they balance things a little better each edition. The rules and card updates should help keep things on an even playing field - at least for a while.
Started with Cephalyx, and will stick it through. No selling the army this time. I'm also taking my time in building it figure by figure, and painting them well.
Don't bother with the big rulebook if you can help it - it's a massive tome and tough to haul around. Get a rules digest from the starter boxes if you can.

Mainly because the big rulebook is a copy/paste from the digest itself. Hell, the Wall Template, which some models REQUIRE isn't in the main rulebook - it can only be found in the starter sets.

The main rulebook is a waste of money. Go for a starter set to get the rules and everything else you need to play, and it costs you 20 bucks less than just the big book.

Have a bunch of Cygnar and some Dwarves. Mostly unpainted and I don't play any more.

a fast paced strategic wargame, about magic and steampunk in a medieval world! 

MK3 its a good improvement to the game mechanics.

Important changes, but also unnecessary nerfs and sloppy balance.

CID looks promising.

A cleaner ruleset but a much stronger emphasis on Warjacks and a noticeable imbalance between Warmachine and Hordes factions.

Privateer Press screwed this version up and hosed their customers.

Not really a board game but a tabletop miniatures game, Warmachine has a lot to offer.  The new edition (Mk 3) is the cleanest rules the game has seen and Privateer Press has shown commitment to taking, evaluating, and implementing community feedback regarding game play rules, released model rules, and rules for models still in development.  There is so much depth to Warmachine, and the sister game Hordes, that you could play for years and still love it every time.

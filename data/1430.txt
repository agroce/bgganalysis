Hmmm...a difficult one to rate.  It has a lot of good and bad points.  

The good - simple system and rules, unusual situation modelled well

The bad - too long, the pieces are rather boring making the task of continually pushing them around even duller (and you DO move pieces more here than in most wargames)

If you like the Ancient period and have lots of time to play, then this is a goer.  If you're not so hot on it and don't like long games, forget it.  Yep - a 5 for me.

Love this game. Will play anytime. Very dramatic to see Vercingetorix sprint to freedom through corridors of battling warriors!
Lots of units for the Gaul to move every turn. Can get a bit crowded thereby testing patience as attacks are figured out.
Not a quick game to set up and get into.

RATING: 5.5
Flaw in this gem:
If you look at General magazine V.14 #1 pg.9, you'll see the game's map with suggested 'best' fort placements - vs. where Caesar actually raised them along the siege works: you'll lose the game if you place them as Julius did!
Why? The only answer is that Caesar had bridged the river gaps WITHOUT forts, allowing him to place them based purely on their attack/defense value, and not as elevated duck boards.
Apparently then, if you want to maximize this game's realism, just assume all gaps along the Roman siege works are automatically bridged, and place your forts as Caesar did: where they will do you the greatest good as siege weapons -- and that's all that's needed to make this a '10'.

Clear victory conditions, fast paced action, unusual situation, and other cool factors make this a good game. Its fun being either player, and difficult to win for either as well. Its fun to set up the romans, and fun to use hidden movement for the gauls, choosing your points of attack....Overrall its a fun, fast-paced game, one of AH's best wargames in my opinion.

Based on fab review in Consumers Guide to Boardgames, this was long my holy grail.  But my first game seemed awful slow and the Gauls seemed sorta generic.  Still, I need to try again, it is an interesting situation.

RATING: 6
I found the Roman side extremely difficult to play.
The Barbarian can wait few turns before striking the attack and foul the Roman on its true position.
When he completes the surrounding of the Roman camp, the Gaul can attack simultaneously in three points. No way the Roman can resist.
I have seen many players winning with the Romans. But just because the Gauls are impatient and attack too early, with the result of being slaughtered piecemeal.
I think an house rule should be introduced to reduce Gauls ability to coordinate attacks if not from adjacent zones. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
The feature of hidden off-board movement by the Gauls, plus a very simple & elegant victory condition (if Vercingeterix exits the map the Gauls win; otherwise, they lose.  As long as Caesar isn't killed), help make this a great game.

Overall the game is unbalanced in favor of the Romans -- although not excessively so.  I remedy this by two house rules:

(1) Vercingeterix has same battle capabilities as Labienus.

(2) The per-cent recovery of the Gauls after the first day of battle can be increased.

Probably the most fascinating wargame I ever had the displeasure to misplace. (Strongly think I gave it to someone else to learn on their own. Mistake!) The rules take a complex tactical situation and break it down into an axciting and fairly straightforward wargame. And playable in an afternoon! Excellent production. Higher rating if played multiplayer.

Good but not a very interactive turn sequence. Gauls have nothing to do in Roman turns. A lot of counters to move. This means a lot of waiting for your opponent. Have only played 2 player. May be better with teams. Like the off-board movement a lot.

Very playable with good excitement levels.  Very balanced with many games decided on the last turn. The Roman's need to set up well to counter-attack well, and launch those lethal 2-1 surround attacks.  The Roman player MUST be opportunistic and aggressive to win.

Not a terrible system, and an interesting tactical situation, but the time required to play this game is seriously out of hand for what you get out of it. At least Siege of Jeruselem has some nice texture, a variety of tactical situations, and a realisitic feel. This doesn&#039;t, so I can&#039;t imagine playing it given the time investment even if it is a simpe system.

This game is simple and very fun, the situation is always tense and the gauls lurking outside the map are a menace hanging on you. I'll give this one a 7,5 if not for it takes forever to play.

A big, sprawling shoving match between the Romans and the Gauls. Bring your tweezers for this one. Simple mechanics (for a wargame), but the sheer size of the game lends it an epic scope and an uncommon degree of feel for a 1970s wargame. Can be very long but is seldom dull. Really gives you a sense of staring out at a lonely tree line and wondering what is lurking on the other side. Would play it more, but space, time, dedication, and opponents are lacking.

A blast to play. Simple to learn. Long - but well worth it. One of the best ancients wargames ever. Can be played with 3.

The Romans bend under the attacking horde, creating real play tension and a ton of player choice.

RATING: 7
The combat and movement systems are about as generic as hex and counter can get.  The hidden movement and strategic donut situation give this game a special interest, however.  For the Romans, the proper set up of forts is often the key to success.  The Gauls need to feint effectively and then hit HARD at their chosen point.  On one side the board edge is very close to the Roman line.  The Roman needs to pay special attention not to be overwhelmed at this point.

At first it seems as though this game is going to be horribly unbalanced, but as the game and mechanics kick in, it becomes a challenge for both sides to be victorious.  I rarely had a runaway victory or a devastating defeat.  It was always a close thing.  I recall it was quite boring for the Gaul player in the beginning whose set up consists of a pile of men in Alesia and a pile in the forest, whereas the would be Romans would be agonizing over each units as they had to be placed over a large area of interior and exteriors walls.

11/23/13 Played a three-player game. 
If I'd been rating Caesar at Alesia 20 years ago I would have rated it a 8. But I have to be realistic and admit the graphics, though still quite functional, have been surpassed by recent developments in this area. But other than that this 37 year old game holds up remarkably well. As far as I know it simulates a truly unique battle, plus its best with three players. Both facets in one game is grand. The battle is tense, and in question until the end. The element of mystery (which zones are the off board Gauls in?) is intriguing. The game is full of tough choices as there are many possible strategies. I like the fact that the two Gaulish players can not communicate. So the inner Gauls are usually just as surprised by the outer Gauls incursions as the Romans!

Yes, we're in Alesia!
Fighting Julius Caesar!
For Alesia Ra Ra Ra!

Ramparts! Towers!
Missle engine showers!
Caesar's special powers...
...Fighting Alesians Ra Ra Ra!

Slingers! Archers!
Hidden Gallic marchers!
In conjuction with departures...
...From Alesia Ra Ra Ra!

Alesia, Alesia!
Yes, we're in Alesia!
Fighting Julius Caesar!
For A-le-sia Ra-Raa-Raaa!

A good wargame for its time. The situation is crying out for a redone with "modern" mechanics.

RATING: 10
The tactical situation offered by this game makes fascinating play. An added bonus is that it makes for a good three player game, which is enhanced when the 2 Gauls are not allowed to communicate!
The tactical donut adds a tension to the game that will not allow a player to be confident of victory until the last dice is rolled. I try to get this game out at least once every 3-4 years and have done so since purchasing it in the 1980's.

An unusual scenario for a wargame on this level.  Pretty basic, standard game, but there are lots of units and a big fortified area to attack or defend. Good game, but too many units for my taste.

Fascinating situation, tense game, a real classic by AH.  However, design is dated and takes a long time to play for what one gets out of it.  Sold on EBay.

RATING: 8
Like many of the older AH games, this one is depressingly underrated. The rules are pretty simple and while there is a time commitment, it is much less than many of the higher rated games that have been published in the last few years.

The situation is both interesting and challenging for both sides and there are enough variables that it can be played many times without the same situation occurring. A game that has stood the test of time.

I don&#039;t know why I love this game so much.  I think the theme of the Alesia battle adds much to a solid, if basic, combat system.  It&#039;s just too much fun to picture yourself as the master strategist, Julius Caesar, or the desperate and savage Vercingetorix.  Admittedly, I am not a war gamer, but this is absolutely my favorite war game of all time.

I have very found memories of this game and still play it (sadly solo) once in a blue moon.

Not sure how game will hold up upon really close inspection.  One negative is that, if two very experience players compete, I think that the game would be very heavily in favor of the Roman player especially given the low attrition built into the CRT and the (appropriate) Roman 2-1 surround rule.

Wow! How to rate this one? Recently played 3 hours of this (covering about 1/8th of a game). It was a lot of fun, (in the traditional hex and counter war game kind of way), but unmanagably long! 

Would love to play a complete game, but that might take a weekend.

RATING: 8
This is one of my favorite all time wargames. It was a wild departure from the usual battle game where one side faces another across a single battle line. This had the famous donut of Roman interior and exterior lines facing an entrenched foe trying to break out from the center and hordes of the foe's allies trying to help from without.

One of Avalon Hill's finest moments -- or three or four hours of play time.  Straightforward, classic game mechanics with a unique and odd tactical/operational situation.  In its time, the best ancients game.Would love to find a good copy of this for less than a king's ransom...

I haven't played this in years, but it kept me off the street when I was a teen-ager. An uphill battle for the Gauls, but not by much. A bona-fide classic and still one of the best ancient games around. I bought this game when I was 12 and it launched a lifelong interest in Ancient History that continues to this day.

There are 2 twelve turn assault phases, made it through one, took a good solid 4 hours of tense playing. Those Barbarians, really get hammered in the abaitus area. Hard to get good odds on the Rampart works, and those tower missles, and slingers, Whew! missles wipe out an entire stack if they get an E, others disrupt mostly. But this game is loads of classic Avalon Hill fun. I would definately play if given an opportunity. And it is a great 3 player game. Can't think of to awful many of those though. The 2 Roman Leaders have a special quality in that they get to pick the best die roll out of 2 or 3 rolls depending on the leader. This is definately a bloody battle. Really gives the feeling of being Barbarians. Just charge and hope for the best. Expect heavy causalities. If ever given an opportunity to play, take it. I don't think you'll be dissapointed. But only if you like having fun, and are not looking for a battle simulation. This is an excellent game.

Great game if you have several hours to kill. I really liked playing this game as either side. If you're Vercingetorix, just expect a lot of casualties. As Caesar, you've got to time it just right - commit too soon or too late and lose. Guess right and slaughter the Gauls.

This is a great war game. I give a lot of war games points off because of the time involved to read up on the rules & play, but other than that this game is a lot of fun. As the Romans you are fighting in an expanding & contracting donut to keep the Barbarians trapped in the city of Alesia, and the relieving force from breaking through to get them out.

Really good game. The amount of counters on board it's quite silly though. It could have been reduced in size and components and still be a blast.
If you have space and time to play (and a couple of intelligent people to boot) this could be next to Maria as the best three player game I've played in a long while...

Even though this is an 'old style' Avalon Hill game I think it still rates with any of the newer designs covering Ancient Warfare. Yes, there is the "Great Battles of History" version of "Alesia" by GMT but this is a far better 'game'.

It simulates the 'situation' that faced both Caesar and Vercingetorix better than the more detailed GMT version. The latter has a much better 'tactical depiction' of the affair but is very dry 'as a game'. I keep coming back to this one.

What a shame this one has not been picked up and released with more state of the art graphics.

RATING: 7.5
I think this a much more interesting game than Caesar's Legions. But it's larger, has a lot more counters, and will take a lot longer to play.
The map is up to AH standards. The counters are different looking, but still nice.
It was hard to get a lot of gamers to play this because of it's ancient setting. But the subject matter is one of Caeser's greatest triumphs. 
The game is rather simple to learn. And I think worth at least one good look.

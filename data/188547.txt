Started to play and gameplay is simple to learn straight forward and theme works well. Need to do some more playing to get a better feel for it, but the whole game "sings" to me. Playing it solo with two-handed and is really easy to keep track. The rule book seems to need a little bit of improvement, some more clarity on some rules, but that is minor - just fill in the gaps and there are FAQs available now which clarify where needed.

First of all the components are all top notch. The art on the Cards is awesome and fits perfectly to theme. Each character you Play is really different, having a complete different deck on his own... so not like in other games where the majority is the same for each character and only a few make a character individual. There are 4 different enemies Group, always with 2 different bosses. Finally 12 Scenarios, however you can Play each with different Monsters or simply create new ones.
Rules are simple and still a lot decisions to take. The starving factor and storage Limit have a good Impact on planning and Timing your Actions. So far my best Kickstarter I went for.

Glad I backed this. Easy to teach, fun and fast to play. Different characters and monster decks give a decent variability - overall good mix of tactics and luck.
Great game. :)

Played only once. 3p. Quite fun co-op exp. The mechanics fits the survival theme. A few ambiguities with some text leading to rules check(and house ruling when couldn't find) but they seem really minor. Overall was  fun fun. Would like to get some day.

I saw this on KS after the deadline, and was immediately intrigued by the art style and card-based gameplay.  Luckily I got to sneak in a late pledge, and just got it in the mail last week.  Comes in a nice box, with very high quality cards, tiles, and tokens.  Even with the Kaiju expansion everything comfortably fits in the box, which makes this portable.  Gameplay is slick, and loads of fun.  The playtime listed on the box is accurate (very easy to pick up, making it great for dinner parties).  In a lot of ways it is reminiscent of Forbidden Island, so keep that in mind.  Also, since it is card-based, you can make new cards if you're feeling creative.  Highly recommended!

The mechanics are easy and intuitive, and the art is FANTASTIC!  Just an all-around fun game to play.  Also works very well with the suggested solo variant.  I only wish the location tiles were a little bigger so you could better enjoy the awesome artwork.

Fun, intense, replayable, easy to grasp. 
Rulebook often unclear on what somethings mean: eg. Stun, Attract aren't in the glossary.
Main downside is the setup to play. Almost took us longer than playing Scenario 2 itself.

The box inserts clearly had an oversight, but not a huge deal. 

Kickstarter very well run. No fuss at all.

KS Edition: expectations are met. However the rulebook should address some special cases/exceptions. This game needs a FAQ.
As you set up the map blindly it can happen that a target tile lies just beside your starting tile which is odd.

This is a fun game. I got it primarily for solo play and (surprise surprise) have so far only played it solo. I have been playing two handed rather than using the single handed solo variant for now. I like the random exploration. It is a bit more fiddly to set up than I expected as you need to go through the full scavenge deck each scenario to set up the individual scavenge decks but it's not that bad. I greatly look forward to the next expansion!

Pros: Awesome game!Quick,fun game. Lot of replayability in this box.

Cons: The box insert is too small in my opinion and doesnâ€™t  work if you want to sleeve your cards(premium sleeves).

Fun, but very random. Not much else to be said, in a very overcrowded genre this offers very little that something else doesn't do better. If you play, play the fireman, He runs around punching things, shooting flare guns, starting fires, hitting people with an axe, setting off explosions and generally being the worst fireman ever while being totally awesome at the same time.

Have print-and-play version from April 2017 Kickstarter.

Hunter innate ability is pretty bad (costing an action and often being a net-negative, when the tile has a positive effect).  Thankful the game developer agreed to change it for the Hunter promo.

Setup is a little fiddly, requiring you to construct the stack of locations and each of the three scavenge decks with specific tiles/cards.  It is tempting to rush through this, but improper scavenge deck construction can completely derail some missions.

Would do well to have variant survivor character cards, like Sentinels of the Multiverse does.  There's currently only a couple Kickstarter promos (Gunslinger, Hunter).

Maximum Apocalypse (MA):

This is an excellent game.  The components are top notch.  The quality of the cards is not quite similar to traditional casino type playing cards.  I have found they may be subject to getting nicks on them during repeated play, so I did sleeve them.  

The game is well designed.  The rules are pretty straight-forward and read thorough without much effort.  There were some minor questions on specific situations or subtle card wording, but these were cleared up through a couple of plays or consulting the conversations on Board Game Geek.  It is nice to have the designer make himself available to answer game play questions from fans/customers.

The game is just plain fun.  If you like games such as, Heroes of the Multiverse then you will really like this game.  It has similar aspects, such as a deck for each character, but adds to the experience by having scavenge cards to add to your deck, a map to explore and specific scenario goals that bring variety and a greater feel of visual planning/strategy.  

The game oozes with theme.  The artwork is excellent.  The characters build up their weaponry and abilities as the game goes on.  Each character deck is unique and had a different effect on play.  The various scenarios and different monster decks make the game experience different with each play.

The issue with games not fitting back into their boxes has been very noticeable of late, especially if you plan to sleeve the cards.  This is not a major issue for MA, as they do leave room in the box for sleeving the cards.  The only drawback, a very minor one, is that the dividers were too high, so that when the scavenge board and rules were placed on top the box top sat a little high.  This was a minor inconvenience that would only be noticed by obsessive-compulsive types (such as myself).  I did fix the issue by trimming down the the top edge of the dividers.  

Another plus is that the game actually shipped out well ahead of schedule.  Wow, this was the first time I have ever received a Kickstarter game well ahead of the proposed shipping date, very impressive.  

The price was very reasonable, especially considering the quality of the components.

I must say that this project/game is a benchmark for what Kickstarter projects should be.  I really want to thank the developers for bringing to life such a great game.

Played the "alpha" prototype and really enjoyed it. There is a lot of thought, planning, and communication involved. The best part though is that unlike other cooperative games of this type, there is no ai villain turn or similar book keeping downtime for players. Play flows from one player to the next and everything happens alongside player turns.

Nice game. Heavily driven by dice and cards - so many random elements. Sometimes quite immersive. Game takes often too long (its random) for the depth of decisions (kill monster, scavange or move). Also setup (compiling tiles, compiling three scavange decks) and sorting and storing after a game takes too much time. Rules are sometimes vague - so that you have to read at BGG how it really works. Regarding the setup: you have to select several tiles; a table shows all tiles used - it would be often much easier and shorter to have a list with the tiles NOT used.
Card quality is really good, tokens are okay - bullet tokes are ridiculous: at least source of some jokes while playing. The art of cards is great. The character decks have some real cool/funnny/ironic cards. The mass of different stuff is nice.

Again I got this through kickstarter...but also played the alpha pre-copy.  That was a lot of fun....and then I got the actual game and the playmats and had an even more enjoyable experience.  I admit I am not the best at games...but I think my friends loved it as I definitely loved it as well.

I had not found a post apocalyptic game that I fully enjoyed until this one. Wow. I have only played twice yet, so we'll see if this one has long legs, but so far I am thoroughly impressed. 
My only complain would be setting up the loot decks at the beginning of the game. I could definitely use an app where I select the mission, and then use the app to draw loots from (then pick the real card from an alphabetical order deck). Just an idea.

Rating based on solo play. The good: awesome art, lots of neat cards, great variety in scenarios, enemies, locations, etc. It can be very satisfying to pull yourself out of a seemingly hopeless situation with the right combo. It was thoughtful of the publisher to include dividers for the cards. The bad: the minimalist-style rulebook leaves a lot of questions. The ugly: apparently there were several errors made on the setup instructions for multiple scenarios.

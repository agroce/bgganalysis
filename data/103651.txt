140202 A cute filler and as advertised in a similar space as No Thanks.  Not that it actually shares that many mechanisms aside from trying to avoid getting stuck with points, but like no thanks its kind of a simple card game with an economic aspect.  Not bad.  Maybe not great, but a fine filler.

I love this game, 15-20 minutes of fresh card playing. So simple but, at the same time, nasty and fun. 

This game should be more known, I think that in the present, gamers often overlook this kind of games and stick to the classics fillers. But, as with harder eurogames, every year some great fillers are edited and 23 is one of the best of the last few years.

RATING: 6
Fun and simple game of trying to efficiently play out of a hand of cards.  Cards are played to the middle of the table, on at a time in player order.  The card you play must be equal to or only one greater than the previous card played, or else you score a point for each number you exceeded the previous card by (points are bad).

Each player also has three green chips.  You may play one on your turn to modify the current top card by up to 5.  So, for example, if the current card is a 13, you could reduce it down to an 8 in order to play a 9 from your hand.  If you don't use your green chips, they reduce your final score by 2 points each (remember, points are bad!).

There are also some other small twists related to passing and dropping out of a hand, but that's the basics of it.  Overall, a very light card game that anyone could pick up and play.

This was described to me as a cross between a climbing game and No Thanks. And, I can see that description fitting pretty well, but two quick hands of this game left me a bit underwhelmed.

It might be the case that more strategy emerges with familiarity, but I didn't feel like there was a lot of "wiggle room" for tactics.

Buen filler de cartas...se precisa muy poco para hacerlo en print and play pero por el precio que tiene merece la pena tenerlo original :)
Es el típico juego que consiste en ir bajando las cartas de la mano a la mesa intentado llevarte las menos penalizaciones posibles. Como particularidad te puedes coger un punto negativo para pasar en vez de jugar carta, e incluso te puedes coger dos puntos negativos para pasar y obligar al siguiente jugador a bajar carta (pura malicia) jeje

RATING: 7
Neat little escalation card game, played over two rounds.  Players are dealt a hand of 15 cards, discard 3 of them, then play out the remainder.  The idea is to play cards onto a common pile, in ascending order.  For each value is skipped (say, jumping from 5 to 8, skipping 6 and 7), take a penalty chip.  Players may hand in some of their precious three bonus chips to reset the current value by +/-5 per bonus chip, but every bonus chip held cancels 2 penalty chips at the end of the game.  You may drop out of a hand at any time, taking a penalty for each card remaining in hand.  Least penalties after two hands wins.

Neat, delightfully nasty little card game - plays in 15 minutes, and is perfect for what it does.

This is a game of numbers and suits, but the fun factor in this one wasn't apparent the way it is in some trick taking games and things like 6 Nimmt, No Thanks and Parade.

23 fits right along with some other games I've played from AMIGO, namely 6 nimmt! and 11 nimmt!.  The biggest difference here is that there's only one community stack that's manipulated throughout play.  There's a good amount of strategy mixed in with the luck of the cards.  Taking a moment to think of whether to play a card and take points, pass and take points, force the next player to play, etc.  It's a very enjoyable experience and plays out quickly.

Because of the quick, simple game play, similar graphic design choices paired as well as the plastic chips, you can't avoid comparing 23 to No Thanks. And unfortunately, any filler is going to have a hard time stacking up to the simple genius of No Thanks.

The choices here appear a little more straightforward than in No Thanks, and it appears that it basically comes down to how you end up using (or not using) your three bonus chips. This seems fine. But you really can end up with a really bad hand that dooms you for a round. I suppose that this should even out over multiple rounds, but it does give the appearance of more unpredictability than in No Thanks, though I guess you could say the same for the way that cards are removed in that game as well.

Anyway, with further play I could see the rating potentially moving up.

Some claim this is the new No Thanks. I disagree. NT is much quicker and accessable by non-gamers.

Nevertheless this is fun to play with players that have some experience, especially if the players attempt to screw each other. Game must be horrible if everyone plays nicely.

A card filler in the same vein as No Thanks!, 23 involves playing numbered cards in ascending order to a common pile. For numbers that you skip, you have to take penalty chips. The game is certainly light, but there's nuance here, involving the decision of when to stay in the round and when to pull out. Just a bit more going on than in No Thanks!, but likely to be enjoyed by those who enjoy that.

A neat 15 minute filler, which I'm always in the market for. The aim is to get rid of your cards, and you can only play a card that's equal to or one higher than the one on the pile, escalation style. The nice bit is that you can take penalty chips to escalate and allow you to play higher, forcing everyone else to possibly not be able to play the skipped numbers unless they use their rare bonus tokens to take the numbers back down. Choosing what cards to discard from your hand at the start also provides for some decisions, as does the choice to pass for 1 penalty chip, or pass and take 2 penalty chips which forces the next player to play - which may trigger them to take a whole mass of penalties. Or not. It's a nice decision to have anyway. Not sure how much replay there is, but it's been enjoyable so far.

RATING: 6

Fun card game where you try to empty your hand. A round always starts with the number 1 & players must add the same number or higher on their turn. For every number gap they take a penalty chip. So for example, playing a 5 onto the 1 results in 3 penaty chips.
Add in some bonus chips that allow you to alter the topmost number & interesting passing/drop out options and you have acool little card game.

A light little ten minute game that plays well with non-gamers and kids. You're trying to get rid of as many of your cards as possible, while weighing up where it's judicious to spend your bonus chips, receive a penalty chip to pass or get two penalty chips to pass and force the next player to play. So you're looking at what cards the player to your left (particularly) has played and skipped. There's a memory aspect and you're relying on each player to the right of the other to do their job and make good plays so there's no runaway winner. It's a combination of good play yourself, being let off the hook by the player to your right, and getting a good set of cards (luck). Most of all it's just a fun little game that takes ten minutes, split between two hands. Enjoyable filler in the vein of Geschenkt.

A little like a bastard child of No Thanks! and 6 Nimmt!, 23! (honorary "!") is a sort of climbing game: deal out almost all of the cards, the 1 leads, subsequent players must play equal or higher. Passing results in a penalty chip, each number you miss results in a penalty chip, or you can pass and take two chips to force the next person to play. Folding results in one chip per remaining card. Each player also has three bonus chips which are worth 2 points but can be traded in to add or remove 1-5 from the top card.

The ability to force the next player to do something is delicious, as is jumping +/- 5 and ruining someone's day. It's basically just very mean: trying to make sure everyone else bleeds more than you do. Even the winner is likely to have a negative score.

With repeated plays, this continues to shine. In practice, there is a mandatory whinging phase, followed frequently by someone having their plans utterly ruined. Delightful!

tl;dr: more of the same but different

Do you like [thing=153]Take 5![/thing]? Do you like [thing=12942]No Thanks![/thing]? Well, you probably should try this as well. You have numbered cards, you want to get rid of them and you want the most points. But getting negative points is just way to easy :)
There might be a big luck factor with the way the cards are dealt, but playing multiple rounds should fix that. I had one game where 80% of my cards where above 16, and the other 2 players had lots of low cards. I guess having more players will also rectify that.
All in all good fun.

A somewhat interesting game of minimizing your own pain while dropping other players in it, as the players try to get all the cards out of their hands, despite being able to only lay cards equal to or greater than what's already been player (from 1-23) and taking penalty points if they jump too many cards ahead.

I'd like to try it some more, but I don't think it'll become a classic like No Thanks!

Fun! It is a variant of No Thanks! No Thanks! is an excellent filler and will always occupy a space on my shelf, but it certainly getting a little stale and old. 23 is pretty fast and while can be a little chaotic, there is some small amount of strategy required to score well and to avoid the penalty chips. Currently rating higher than No Thanks! 

8/2015
I still think highly about the game, but more on par with No Thanks! There is a fair bit of chaos and not much one can do to plan beyond your previous player. Like any filler type games, it fills a niche in the collection for "in between" type games. However, I am not sure it will be as beloved as No Thanks.

Great filler card game that doesn't quite scratch the 'No Thanks' itch. This is mostly because it takes players  a little longer to realise how to play and the game depends on all players playing to a similar ability.

Very good card game. Similar to and much better than No Thanks.

4.5 after 1 play

The game seems to need more playtesting and adjustments. For example, the effect of the bonus chip should be different with different player counts. Component quality is decidedly average.

A suspenseful, risky game in the same general feel as [thing=12942][/thing].  It's very fast, but it also sort of boils down to a guessing game.  :shrug:

One of my favorite fillers that gives you some choices, a way to mess with opponents, and quick playtime.

Similar to:

No Thanks!

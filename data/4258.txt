One of the many strategic WW2 that nearly manages to be the holy grail for the period. It doesn't quite manage it becoming quite fiddly and bogged down in the later game. Manages to create the chaotic feel of a world gone mad in 39/40 period but like Avalon's Hill Third Reich, this (the advanced version of Kreig!) adds too much chrome while solving the techinical glitches in the original version.

This game COULD be fantastic, that is if you like WWII grand strategy like World in Flames (ADG). However the rule book is nearly impossible to read, as it is appallingly organised. I did not have the time to work it out. After reading the rules and attempting 1 game we gave up as there were too many questions we could not answer. Re-write the rules PLEASE. If you thought the Wif rules were badly organised don't buy this game!

The game is good. Rules are somewhat old style, but there are the strategy cards that give a very good options pool.
Clever idea the strategic asset rule that can be used once in a while.
The possibility to change the political decisions pre WWII make every game different. This is a very big advantage over EE, that follows more historical options. One of the more annoying aspect is the need to change armies in corps to move faster and assembly again to fight. It wouldn't be more easy to let armies reserve move?

A clasic wargame hexagonal map, with updated rules for today.  Recreates WWII much better than Axix and Allies and can be played in less time since the game is played with seaons and mind and a stoping place that one player either claims victory or doesn't.  Also comes with smaller scenarios and a random setup for the countries listed.

Looks like the perfect ETO game. It took me over a year and a couple of readthrough sessions to appreciate the ruleset.  Now ready to start playing...
-------
EDIT - it is now 2 years and running and I am finally through the rules to the point that I understand where to look for something and figure out why I need to worry about some of the comments in the strategy guide.  This is not reading for the faint of heart, but the rules, once the system is seen in its entirety, are not that bad.

It seems that I am destined to begin playing it just as TK2 comes out and I have no interest in more chrome.  Unrelated to this, while the system works well for ETO, it seems completely out of its element in the PTO unless the CBI is made the focus of the action.

I absolutely love the option card mechanism and the abstraction of assets via the delay box.  The event mechanisms, that can swing the replay far away from the historical norm, actually seem to add to the fun of the game as well as the replayability.  My fear is that I will be good at this just as the rest of the world masters TK2 and I will be relegated to the junior leagues...

My favorite strategic wargame. A "game" rather than a "model" of WWII in Europe. The possibility of the players to play it out historically OR ahistorically is a big plus. 

Lots of surprises via seasonal card play. Makes perfect plans nigh impossible.

The nicely abstracted Air, Naval, Economic and Political systems make for a nice "panzer-pusher" ground battle game.

Very much looking forward to TK2 and Dai Senso.

A highly skilled TK player told me a secret a long time ago: "Totaler Krieg is a game about attrition."  Something to keep in mind if you like games about maneuver and position, where encircled armies surrender.  This is not that kind of game.  Nothing dies in this game unless you kill it with a direct attack, and encircled cities are supply sources that also provide a large defensive benefit.  In that respect it's very similar to WiF: the Eastern Front can feel like Tarawa, even more so if "Stalin Line" is played to create forts on every critical rail juncture.

If the game goes through the historical period, it has 52 turns, with 3 player turns per game turn, or 156 player turns.  I am bewildered by the people claiming you can play this in 20 hours. You can play it in 60 hours, perhaps, if you spend an average of only 23 minutes per player turn (and zero time for setup, turn-end activities etc.), which strikes me as optimistic, given that factor-counting, and trying to carefully set up attacks, and follow on exploitation attacks, to channel enemy retreats is a big part of the game. 

A relatively small number of pieces for a game with such a grand scope.  The weight here is in the rules, many of which are extremely counterintuitive and ahistorical (Hungary suddenly declaring war on Germany and invading it, Germany not being allowed to attack Poland during the one clear turn in Sept 1939 when their Ultimatum "Blitz" card is in play, etc.). Large swings of fortune due to die rolls (use the Luftwaffe and it might return next turn, or six turns from now; get a bad roll on the Bomb Plot and your Axis Tide marker will be reset, negating all your efforts in 1939-42 to set a high tide mark, etc.).  I have grown weary of long games with a lot of luck.  I guess they're fun if you're lucky.

(2007-10-31) A very good treatment on WWII in the European theater of operations.  It is not a simple game, but it does play well once you learn the system.  The unit, map and time scales are all about where I think they need to be to cover a game on this topic well.  The highlight is the use of the cards to determine a nation's domestic, political and military posture for a season which must be chosen in advance that requires a lot of decision making beyond the typical 'how many tanks do I build so I can crush Russia'.

While some of the mechanics distract, overall this to me is the best detailed treatment of WWII in Europe integrating the economic and political aspects of the war easily into the overal picture and instead of bogging the game down with them they drive the posture of your faction.  An innovative and refreshing alternative to the detailed assembly line production tracks and unrelated political random events of other games.

Game designer is a credit to the industry. Game gets great reviews. Bought it, opened it, fiddled with it, but did not find it sufficiently compelling to displace the Third Reich line in the collection. If there was a flaw, it seemed to want to be a strategic and grand strategic game at the same time. Perhaps that is to others' tastes. Simultaneously playing Stalin, the Politburo and Zhukov (or Roosevelt, Marshall and Eisenhower) was a bit much for me. Hitler's War falls on the opposite side of the spectrum, as too big picture and as a result too abstracted.

I may never get to play World in Flames, but why would I ever want to when this genius game is out there??This game's heart is a corps-level hexmap of the ETO, nothing too fancy there. What it does brilliantly is the abstracted air and naval war along with a great political system to make it all work.  The events look like they'd allow you take the game off the narrow historical ruts that many games force you into. Bit at the same time they keep you in the realm of military and political realities. I cannot wait to play a full game rather than the on-map scenarios!

The best WWII in Europe game I know.  It's a long game, but the turns are fairly short, and it captures the epic feel of WWII.  Germany is mighty, then tested, then either hangs on to Europe, or starts the long collapse. 

The game succeeds in keeping the focus on the ground war in Europe.  Abstracts the production, technology, air warfare, and diplomacy, but never makes them insignificant.  The Game keeps the focus on ground warfare, and every game I have played has been fantastic for making sense.  Very little "gaming the game," like how 3rd Reich often becomes during the production phase.

RATING: 7
My favorite WW2 ETO game (though I want to try out Europe Engulfed).  Why?  All the fiddly systems that usually bog down strategic WW2 games - air and sea power, production, offensives, diplomacy - have been elegantly abstracted down so you can concentrate on the big picture.  The strategy cards prevent players from minimaxing ERPs and encode some history (e.g. the Soviets need to pause to create reserves before launching a general offensive).  The Battle of Britain is resolved between support units and in the delay box rolls.  And the multi-step unit organization means you can see each army evolve over time.  Still a bit too big for my time constraints, but still an amazingly elegant design.

Valiant try at designing a WWII Euro threatre wargame, but, like almost all, fell short for me.

I REALLY wanted to like this game. You can tell the designers approached well covered subject with a real flair, a true labor of love and some unique design mechanisms. 

My main sparring partner (who also loves monster wargames - and is old WiF/EiA player) and I spent 4 nights trying to play it, and a bundle of time trying to understand the rules. In the end, we had to throw up our hands - and we really enjoy "the beasts" of wargaming.

Some real decent innovations, here, but, we justed couldn't see "the forest" thru the trees.

I de-rate it for a couple of things... First off, too much chrome dirtying up the clean and clever Krieg system. Next, the Soviets are too weak now (recommend using the TK II proposed 3/6 rule for stacking ie 3 units or 6 steps to alleviate). And some wierd gameplay things, like it is better to defend in cities and not form a front line. Finally there's  the poor quality of the components, the maps didn't match very well and Decision recommended cutting and trimming them to suite

Total war of WW2.  Few games can become a classic, and this one is one of the even fewer which is truly a classic "strategy" game at an instant and in itself.  A colossal game on this scale.  How does it compare to Third Reich or Advanced Third Reich?  560 counters look like a manageable one.  But the oversize box causes me headache...even so, the game has arrived, with the captivating Strategy Guide as well.  And yes, I like to read strategy. I am now drowned in it. Just like a small dream comes true.  It is a beautiful game (no, I don't mean the strategy cards) and has excellent maps, with all the important strategic hexes for ease of play. The 2 maps join perfectly and Northern Europe looks comparatively huge than the continent.  Perhpas this gives more weight to the Narvik invasion than other similar games.  But the special event (strategy) cards are just ugly. Don't expect GMT standard in Decision Games and it is a 1999 production already. Designer Alan Emrich is an experienced computer game guru (he is also a developer for the now hall of fame classic "A House Divided").  I am very excited to see a focused, user-friendly and playable wargame.  The number of options available in the game makes you really feel like you were the overall commander, looking for all the viable strategies and expected to be countered and find a new strategy again.  Something like...Hitler, Churchill, Manstein, Rommel, Mussolini, Patton...all you can eat..., no, all you can have.

Best strategic WWII game I have come across. The incorporation of political events onto a fast-playing movement and combat system mean the game is easy to play but very unpredictable.

By now, you either are on board with the Krieg system or you are not. That said, this is a major upgrade from the original game. The pre-war generator is pretty funny.

Finally got my first taste of this after years and years of ownership - we played a 10-turn West Front one-map scenario which pitted Britain and France against Spain and Italy while Germany is busy handling Russia off-map.  Fantastic!!  The classic Avalon Hill "count yer mice and rolls yer dice" wargaming with ZOCs and CRTs is all here, but the political systems, organization rules, air-sea interactions all connect to revolutionize actual play.  You cannot succeed without planning several turns ahead, but neglecting tactical positioning will put you in a hole.  I don't know when I'll have time for a full campaign game (VASSAL?) but as far as I'm concerned, this is where WW2 strategic wargaming state-of-the-art is at.

Greatly dislike that your aircraft units, after each use, are delayed from re-use for a number of turns based on a dice roll. Other than that, it seems to be a great game. (I would prefer a standard wait time, perhaps dependent on country and time frame.)

In my 25 years of wargaming I have played quite a few grand strategic games on the Second World War.
I've played Third Reich, ETO, World in Flames and some others, but Totaler Krieg! beats them all.
The design is so elegant. Players concentrate on strategy (planning seasons ahead) and on land combat. Air and Naval operations are (thankfully!) handled in a clever and abstract way, which is fast and yet very realistic.
The playing time for the whole thing is still quite long. With three very experienced (!) players you still need about 20-25 hours. But this is time well invested.
Also, the rulebook is not very accessable. The rules are not complicated, though, as I have played many games with newbies, whom I taught the game on the fly without encountering any major problems.

I have never been able to bite through the rules.  I had no problem with the supposedly more difficult games in the OCS series, those rules were written down logically, but the TK rules are a nightmare.

My favorite WW2 ETO game. It plays fast, you don't bother with bean counting and the rules are not that complicated.
The way diplomacy is treated allows good or bad surprises, players don't control everything and I think it's better that way.

I only rate this a ix rather than higher is that it's a fairly complex game to relearn.

The scale and scope are excellent and so are the production values.

Some very good ideas in the game that appear to work very well....but it is a very long game to play. When Russia is in the war the game realy slows down as each piece, and where it is positioned can become vital.

My only dislike of the game is the collaps rule for Russia. IIRR this is a game changing event that is based on a die roll. Russia will either collapse or it won't. The more Russian objective the German have the greater the chance of a collapse. But it is a die roll and the events are enourmous

When this first came out, I played it nonstop and would have easily given it a 10. Now I have to downgrade it to a 7 only because now I playtest the next edition (TK Axis Empires) exclusively.

That's not an easy game to start with. Rules are quite disturbing, but when you understand them, you can play all the WW2 european front in a reasonable time with an excellent historicity. Fabulous gameplay.

I owned AETO, World at War, World in Flames, and Total Krieg. I love all of the them. We have tried to play one by one and took 6 months to finish them. If we play 4 more monster games and we all will get divorced.

I want to give this a 10, since I like it so much. But there are a couple of things about the game which only become evident with repeated playings that are slightly annoying. For example, defending the beaches of France is done best in some turns by *not* being on them, and in others by being there in strength. That aside, this is easily my favourite Grand Strategic game of any era, and far and away the best WW2 Grand Strategic game. There's no fiddly book-keeping, you don't need to keep track of anything not on the play areas, and it recreates, in the designer's words, 'the feel of the world spinning off its axis'. The players do not have total control over every thing that happens, but they can play to maximise or minimise the chances of certain events. The option card system is the finest wargame mechanic I have come across.

A well written rulebook and relatively simple system make learning really easy.  Unfortunately the card-driven system also makes games somewhat predictible up until Barbarossa.  Overall, a very nice introduction to wargames for non-wargamers, but hardcore grognards probably won't stay interested for too long.

Some eccentricities to be sure but I think this design is on to something.  Still waiting for the perfect game on this subject and scale though.

A fine treatment of WW2 in Europe.  You are somewhat constrained by history, but the choice of card play (although fairly restricted) lets you vary somewhat from that path.

Best ETO game with lots of political option. The system that allows players to roll up a different inter-war history is very clever and allows players to play up different options. Most WWII force players to follow history, e.g. Germany must attack Poland/West/USSR in that order, but by rolling up different pre-war history players aren't bound by the historical time line at all.

One of the first card driven games that takes a long time to play but well worth the effort IMHO.

Could never quite understand what I was supposed to be doing. A game that I wanted to like but just couldn't figure out.

Very enjoyable.  Slight concern would be that if the Allies can always just focus on capturing the Ruhr and Berlin (which is what secured me a victory) it might render much of the other areas of the map redundant.

I have played this game at Dice Tower Con a few times.  I love this game!  I have played many, many, many war games over the years and the lack of information (the fog of war) is very much a part of this game which is what makes it so enjoyable.  You need to allocate your forces, hope your bluffs are not discovered and plan to launch your operations to maximize your strategies.

Got to play a pre-production version but rules were finalized and really enjoyed it. The major pluses for me were the changing nature of the balance of power as U.S. involvement grew and the end game option of deducing the two must win countries.

Enjoyed this. It's not really a historical wargame IMO, more of a historically themed euro, but the bluff and counter-bluff elements, along with the intelligence, is nicely put together. In an earlier day, when we weren't so totally swamped with games (like 10 years ago maybe), I think this would have gotten a lot more play. Still, if you play both wargames and euros, and especially if you like Columbia's brand of games, check this one out. The tension of planning and anticipating operations is great. The 90-120min on the box is a little generous IMO, I'd probably plan on 2.5hr until you get the hang of it.

Was ridiculously priced when this first appeared in the UK (around £50-60) - eventually picked it up for £30 which seems about right.

The gameplay is good with lots of interesting ways to bluff and deceive and try to determine where the blow will fall against you. Getting to 70 VP as the Axis seems very hard but time will tell.

The board could do with being a little bit bigger to provide a bit more room for the cards ad like most games where cards get laid on a board they tend to slide about and spin somewhat - we need non-slip boards (a first world problem to be sure) but the mouse-mat style material that the Legendary games use would be great.

I would rate this game "11" if I could. My brother and I can't get enough of this game. The depth of possible strategies keeps drawing us back to try more and more sneaky operations. 

Love it, highly recommended to anyone who likes a very thematic and engrossing 2 player game that will keep you glued to your seat from beginning to end, while planning your strategies and eyeing your opponent with suspicion.

All I can say is wow.  I'm generally not very generous with my ratings, but Fog of War really spoke to me, and I lost my first game!

Repeated plays might poke holes in the system, but until then, I am totally on board with everything this game tries to do.  While I can't exactly comment on balance until it gets tabled more, I can at least describe the experience to the best of my ability.

Fog of War foregoes traditional wargaming tropes (I wouldn't even call it a wargame, to be honest) to represent, well, the fog of war.  Most games feature either hidden units or rotatable blocks that face one player to ensure that there is a sense of mystery and/or surprise that simulates the fog of war.  Fog of War (the game), however, abstracts the actual combat details in favor of maneuver and logistics.

That is to say, rather than focusing on the nitty-gritty of warfare, FoW takes a step backwards and has players jockeying for position over anything else.  This is done through the clever use of cards and planning your operations in advance (think Xidit-style programming).  For every space/country on the map, there is a corresponding space on the board as well as a corresponding location card for each player (both players have a deck of cards the describes every space on the map).  Players will either play cards to an operation in planning or to the board itself for defense provided they meet the correct requirements.

The bulk of the game revolves around its programming mechanism.  How it works is you basically have a hand of cards that describe forces available to you and what type they are (simply ground or naval or both in the case of air support)  and on your turn you can either add these cards to existing operations already in their planning phase or load them up into a new one (by pairing them up with a hidden location card).  The key to this is that you cannot launch a planned operation until two turns after it was initiated.  In other words, if you plunk down cards for a new operation (basically planning an attack on an area), you won't be able to actually execute it for two turns unless you want to incur a penalty.  Conversely, waiting until the last minute provides a bonus, but more time for your opponent to possibly plan against it.  Similarly, if you own a territory on the map, you can play cards directly to the board for defensive purposes, face-down so that nobody knows what's truly sitting there.  There are plenty of dummy cards for bluffing that means someone can overcommit to an operation - let me tell you, finding out that your stack of 8-strength going off to fight a stack of 0's is quite a sobering experience.

Combat, then, is quite simply a game of numbers.  If you double your opponent's forces, you win.  If you win, you leave your forces on the map and can recall them later.  Conversely, if your opponent doubles you, then you lose and you all go to the dead pile (to be possibly recruited later).  The key here is that if neither of you doubles each other, then you both lose half your forces and need to resolve the fight again next turn, which gives you [i]both[/i] an opportunity to stack that fight even more.

What occurs over the course of the game is this emergent feeling of wonder as it begins to unravel and reveal itself.  While the objectives for each player are pretty straightforward, achieving them through what is ultimately a cat-and-mouse game of deception and trickery makes it truly mesmerizing.  You begin to realize that you are open on every front and you can't possibly protect everything - where do you concentrate your efforts without opening yourself up to an easy counterattack?  What holes need to be plugged up?  It's all superbly wonderful and demands that you explore the game more and more.

It has been a long time since I felt so good losing a game and I would definitely recommend everyone try this out.

Only one game until now, but our feelings were very good. I consider it a wargame, even if there are some "euro" mechanics. The designer puts you in the shoes of the great planners of World War II, also playing cat and mouse agains your oponent. This is a very nice discovery, I want to play it again sooner than later.

Interesting game. The time is way off, I'd say around 2.30hrs, and maybe a little bit over two hours when you do. 

Components are a mixed bag. While the map and operation clock are good, I can't say the same for the player pad which looks a little flimsy. The cards are good stock anyway. 

Gameplay can be a little wonky with the adversary hugely interfering in your plans by pure chance, or - if the right intel has gotten in the wrong hands - by purpose. 

All in all it feels like a game of blind cyclops bashing each other to death. You get to do some educated guesses where the next punch's going to go to, but you have to base yourself on very little information and apparently innocent actions such as counting how many cards are somewhere or looking at certain parts of the board can give your surprise factor away. And... knowing that, you can play by misdirecting the other. 

All in all a pleasant game which I'd suggest and want to play again if I can.

I was intrigued by this game of strategy, planning, bluff and intelligence as soon as I heard about it. I loved the idea of a different kind of war-game - not hex-and-counters where the fog of war is never more than partially simulated, not a block game, not a card game, but one focused on operational planning based on defective knowledge taking place behind an imperfect veil of secrecy. The setting, the European theatre of the Second World War, seemed ideal.

I’ve only played 1 incomplete game, playing the Allies against a good strategic thinker who predictably beats me at most of the games we play. The game was incomplete because at the start of 1944, the last year of the game, I conceded. I was well behind and while I could see a possible route to victory, I had really lost the will to continue. It was 2 in the morning and we had been at it for more than 4 hours - on top of 90 minutes of me explaining the rules to him.

The concept is excellent and the game is well-thought-out. The constant dilemma of how to distribute always-inadequate resources, with imperfect knowledge of what your opponent is planning, is a key feature that lies a the heart of the game. The long build-up to an operation is both frustrating and satisfying. All of this creates an atmosphere that feels somehow true, in that the game makes an excellent fist of simulating the problems of operational command.

In a weird way, this game has an echo of Risk. Where battles in Risk pit armies of different sizes against one another and subject the outcome to the roll of dice, The Fog or War pits armies of different sizes against one another in an even more bloodless way, since all that matters is whose army is biggest, and by how much. Conquering territory is what matters in Risk, and the more you have the more you earn. In The Fog of War, conquering territory is also important, and also earns you dividends, but it is more subtle than that, and the additional subtlety provides much of the tension and appeal of the game.

In our game, the Axis planned and launched an early chain of operations against north Africa, rolling up the Allies in one devastating sequence of moves. This was an uncanny recreation of the historical battles of 1941 - but with neither the siege of Tobruk nor the second battle of El Alamein to prevent an outright Axis triumph.

That series of operations, set against historical reality, brought out one missing component in The Fog of War - overstretched supply lines. Supply is a key element in the game, but it’s a binary device - either you’re in or out of supply. It might be interesting to see a future development of the rules that limits the ability of the phantom Rommel to ferry across the Western Mediterranean, invade Morocco, and charge all the way across the north of Africa to the Levant in a single brief season, and all without any consideration of lengthening supply lines.

The game introduces another interesting innovation - the possibility of gathering intelligence on the opponent’s intentions. In practice, despite using the mechanic several times, I never gathered any useful intelligence. My opponent used it twice, but because the mechanic prevents you from knowing what they discover, I don’t know if it was useful. A nice touch, and well implemented.

The operations wheel is a stroke of genius. The rondel, introduced by Mac Geerts in a series of excellent games, is turned on its head here. It governs not the choice of moves you may make, but instead simulates the initiation of a operation and its steady build-up to the moment that you launch it against - you hope - an unsuspecting opponent. It’s a brilliant device that I expect to see picked up by other designers. As implemented in The Fog of War, it also allows the player to build up forces at the last minute before an operation is launched, which helps greatly to intensify both the sense that the opponent’s intelligence about the operation was faulty and the impossibility of reacting quickly to a sudden redeployment of troops.

The most serious criticism I have for the mechanics of the game concerns the separation of the attacking and defending forces. In a war, armed forces are armed forces, and a German buildup on the Polish border may signal the intent to attack Poland, but if Poland were to preemptively attack Germany, the German army would not sit on its hands. In The Fog of War, however, defensive forces are organised on the circumference of the map and offensive ones assembled on the operations wheel. In this game, if there were no German forces in the defensive spaces, an attack from Poland into Berlin would be unopposed despite an overwhelming offensive German force sitting on the rondel and aimed at Poland. I feel that an improvement in the game would allow the Axis player, in this case, to use forces assembled on the operations wheel in defence. It would also serve to increase the sense of risk and the imperfection of intelligence.

Play experience

I enjoyed it well enough, and the time passed quickly, but I never felt much excitement. I was twice surprised by my opponent, but despite the outcome - both times devastating - I never felt that I really cared much. Perhaps this was because I viewed the game as a trial learning game, in which my investment was in understanding how the game works, rather than a full-on trial of wits. I don’t know if that’s the reason, but my experience of the game was strangely joyless. Perhaps it was simply that the game went on much too long. 

Duration

It took us 260 minutes - into the small hours of the morning - to get through 4 years of war. That’s far too long for what the game is, though much of it was spent with our noses in the rulebook hunting down this or that detail or discussing the meaning of this or that ambiguous sentence. I would hope that future games between us would take half that for a full game, which would bring it just above the upper end of the range cited on the box, of 90-120 minutes.

The rulebook

My experience of the game was marred by the rulebook. It is not the worst I have encountered, but on first reading I decided that it was sufficiently poorly written, badly organised, and unfit for purpose, that I rewrote the rules to produce my own abridged and reorganised version (https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/153655/reorganised-and-shortened-rules-v10). 

Components: 

The 4-panel board feels like a travel version of a full-sized board. Cramped and miserly, the spaces available in many of the provinces are quickly choked by a clutter of counters which hide important information on the map. Cards in the defence spaces around the perimeter are shoulder-to shoulder, making it hard to move them without disturbing neighbouring cards. The cards slip and rotate on the board and on the player cards, so that it is easy to disturb the board state accidentally. I may possibly make a more generous full-sized 6-panel custom board for myself. That would give me the opportunity to rework the art, particularly of the map, which has a strange, gaudy, athematic and anachronistic feel to it. Hitler and his generals did not pore over maps that looked like something out of a fantasy game involving goblins. I would also redesign the tracks on the right of the board to take up less space and fit better into the thematic world.

The cards are small (6.8 x 4.4cm). They feel fiddly in my rather elderly hands, and they slide about on the board and player card. The decks come interspersed with 32 blank cards that presumably originate in unprinted areas of the cardstock. They give the impression of waste or carelessness. Such a shame.

The game comes with 3 small ziplock bags, which is not enough to hold the 5 different kinds of tokens.

The player pad is flimsy, but the operations wheel is excellent.

Overall impression: a diamond, perhaps still slightly in the rough, but this game is a key innovation in wargames.

02/13/17 Finally punched out the counters and thought it very odd there wasn't anything in the box about how to put the Ops boards & spinner together. No diagram, no mention in the rules, nuthin'! It every game I've ever bought where the customer has to assemble anything there has been either "how to" in the rules, or some small slip of paper with a diagram. The designer & publisher of this game probably assume their product, with which they're intimately familiar, is so simple it doesn't need one. But I've bought some games "that require some assembly" that if you don't do it just right, you've ruined the game.

RATING: 7.5
Based on one play: Unlike most battle games, you have no troops on the board in Fog of War. You place cards that represent your armies either around the board to defend your locations or in a very clever operations wheel in order to attach. Your operation wheel turns each round and allows you to add more reserves but after two turns you can then send out your troops. You must plan well in advance and surprise the opponent as they will obviously defend. As well you can spy on your opponents cards (if they do not block you). Battles can be costly as you may lose your cards but at the end of the year you can purchase any lost cards. There are specific objectives for the Axis, while the Allies must figure out that objective and prevent it. A very strategic and well thought out two player game.

Played this tonight. Two hours. Two player ETO WW2. One year per turn. Top level, mainly naval and land, quite abstract, sort of Euro hybrid. But has its moments. 

You are generally plotting offensives that are delayed by a planning cycle, and which are unknown to the enemy but can be scoped out by Intel. I got lucky and discovered the Axis were going for Leningrad and bolstered in time. Some offensives bog down and can be reinforced, others are instant wins and losses. Winning survivors of the battles move to defence in the region but can be recovered and strategically redeployed at year end. 

I am going to say History Lite but, like Axis and Allies, there can be some evocative campaigns. Our North Africa worked, and we had Anzio, defeated Sealion, Taranto and a decent blitzkrieg in the South of France. On the other hand Russia was barely touched. 

What seems certain is that the Axis has a tough run to 70 victory points. I would say this is beacuse the situation remains a little static after turn one where more cards are available. The numbers decline but the quality rises as the war progresses. This could be newbie/sub optimal play and a better player at the helm might make light work of it. 

My feeling was that we were a year late on everything that was identifiable as history. Storyboarding would be interesting to check. For instance, I could not see a way of breaking the Atlantic Wall in 1944 or perhaps even 45, which is not played. The clever part here is that defenders are secret and could be dummies. You are certain only of an absence of defenders. Not realistic but nicely gamey. Another neat Euro trick is hidden objectives for the Axis. In our game italy falling ended the game early as the Axis were tasked to defend it. 

There is something of the QG vibe of unfolding narrative, but this is slower, more static and you make up your own card text. But the structure is two player and two player only.

Interesting. Worth a look.

As an historical strategy game instructor/club leader, I highly recommend this highly unique and thoroughly well-conceived and designed game.  Excellent treatment of planning and decision-making under uncertainty.  Provides much of the perspective on the real challenges of command that FtF wargaming misses: operational planning based on imperfect intelligence, the need for multiple cycles of preparation given scarce resources and multiple contending requirements, the threat that enemy intelligence will discover your plans and enable the adversary to counter them, and hence the need for operational security and, where possible, deception.

"Fog of War" offers a valuable counterpart to "Axis & Allies" in instructional gaming for youths.  Demands deep strategy (could have been titled 'Art of War' or 'SunZi Fights the Big One').  Will push students beyond tactics and force-on-force calculations to strategy, intel and planning.  Game is thought-provoking for adults but quite accessible to journeyman high schoolers or veteran middle schoolers (if you happen to run a program that produces the latter!).

Components are excellent.  Forces are represented by cards placed face-down for concealment.  Mapboard is, as some have noted, too small (minor complaint).  Operational wheel is a very clever device.  Allocation of 'intel tokens' requires subtle weighing of costs/benefits -- and the resulting imperfect intel 'take' requires subtle inference.

I'm a 32-year intel professional and this game feels like my job!  I'm considering offering it for analyst training.  I'm also trained in staff planning and I can attest that either Engelstein served a decade or more in the officer corps and attended Command and Staff College, or he boasts remarkable intuitive insight into how staff planners think.  Moltke and Mueffling would be pleased!

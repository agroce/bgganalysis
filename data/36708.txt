Not easy to evaluate after one game. Great components and nice mechanics. I really understand the difficulties to balance sport simulation and the modern game standards... i tried myself... the author arrived very close... very close... this game should be compared with other ciclyng games only... and overall it results the best i think. So a 7+ as a modern game, 9 as a ciclyng game.

I am not a great fan of racing games.  There are just two others in my collection.  However, the Tour de France is one of my favourite sporting events, so I can't resist trying any cycle racing game.

Leader 1 presents mechanics familiar from many other racing games. As in the Tour de France, the keys are to manage your energy wisely, letting team-mates and opponents tire themselves on your behalf, and to time your breakaways perfectly.  The game offers scope for realistic tactics and dramatic chases. I'd agree with those who suggest playing with no more than five so that everyone can have three riders.

Leader 1's modular tiles allow the creation of  hundreds of different courses.  The artwork is very pleasing.  The rider figures are good looking though very delicate.  The English rules translation is a bit fuzzy here and there.

Without doubt the best cicling simulation.

If you like boardgames is a very good game.
Feels a "bit" like hare & tortoise but without luck.

Takes as long as an actual cycle race!
Starts off slow but once breakaways start happening this is incredibly exciting. Tons of replayability due to the hundreds of different tracks one can make.
We played with three stages over the course of the race so there were lots of times where a sprint would happen to gain points then the bike would fall back to conserve enegry. It feels very much like watching an olympic cycle race or the tour de France.
Recomended

OK, we played using the wrong slipstreaming rules (even after checking this several times, as we felt it HAD to be wrong).  Abandoned the game after an hour - far too fiddly.  Dunno if we had too many riders out of the peleton, but it was taking ages.

I am not a great fan of sports games, but I was very impressed with the how the details and game play of L1 captured the action of a Tour.  Having been warned not to start with a long race we played a short (15?) hex race.  Even this took two hours, but there were decisions to be made and the final sprint panned out very realistically, albeit very slowly.  The track pieces were very nice, although I much prefer matt finishes.  The cyclist playing pieces will require careful handling.  All three of my cyclist failed their first chance roll, so I was well out of it - but then taking the risk was my choice.  I would probably be more risk averse next time.  Impressive game, but rating reflects my lack of appreciation of this genre.

Talking to Scott about this and how this game is more of a simulation, he suggested that we don't get it because it will be boring.  There is no reason to leave the peloton until the last quarter of the race.  Scott is a big cycling fan and he falls asleep watching the Tour.

Have gotten this out like 10 times but have never played it.  It just looks so difficult to learn.  I did this same thing with Power Grid and finally  some friends who had already played it showed us how to play and it became one of my favorite games so maybe this is destined for that same fate.  UPDATE:  Pulled it out one day and read through rules again and it just clicked.  I really enjoy this game now and have worked out a 1 card expansion to it as well.  Really cool game.

Another pretty good simulation racing game with simple enough rules to learn quickly. Game is fun but really needs a campaign game to really shine. In a one of course there's always one sort of cyclist who's going to win and the game seems a bit stale. When you play different games as a campaign it gets a lot more strategic and more fun.

If you understand about cycling you  will make home rules to improve the gameplay.

Need more plays to, almost sure, upgrade my rating from 7.

*update*

Playing a tour race with several stages the game turns more interesting because there are an overall clasification based in turns of advantage, you can sacrifice one rider for your leader save energy for the next stage,... It is important to balance the Tour in flat stages and mountain stages to make the game more interesting.

I upgrade the rating to a 7.75

Maybe this game should be called Peloton because with a simple uphill-downhill course, the best approach seems to be riding the peloton up the hill then breaking out to race for the finish (and hope you don't roll poorly for the gravel hazards).  If you don't ride the peloton, there's a pretty good chance that it will swallow you up like the blob a few turns after you break away.  There are tons of tiles to make interesting combinations of terrain for races (perhaps reducing the peloton problem), but overall it's the same as many other race games... a slow and calculated procedure and not a fast-paced race.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Pretty decent representation of a bike race, with 3 riders of differing abilities making up each players team. I like the way that the control of the peloton moves around and the way the mechanincs are designed to suit different types of ground. Definitely one to play again. The bits are nice too!

The way that the course hexes are put together to make different types or races really affects the strategy you have to pick to get your guys to the front with enough energy left to win the race.

RATING: 6
While I think cycling fans will find a warm place in their hearts for this one, I honestly wasn't that impressed. It seems like once you get ahead in this game, you are totally screwed. I understand that a key element of bike racing is drafting, but this doesn't mean "staying out of first place". In reality, if you watch cycling, you'll see that packs almost continuously turn over the leader. Everyone wants to be part of the pack, but nobody wants to be in the lead, so you see basically a rotation where cyclists stay in first for only a few moments before returning to the back of the pack, unless they're timing their breakaway. In this game, with perfect knowledge of energy levels and no realistic way to get out of first place once you are in it (players behind you can *always* adjust to keep you ahead of them), the game just feels off, like a mathematical exercise where when you do your breakaway is dictated by fairly straightforward math rather than judgment, and where the outcome of a long-ish game is decided on only one or maybe two real decisions. You can say that if you don't want to be in first, don't leave the peleton in the first place, but if that's the case, there is no game here at all (and it bears mentioning that unless you play with 5 or fewer places and multiple cyclists per player, there is hardly any game here in the first place).

Also, the risks you take in this game are ridiculous. You can try to speed down that hill if you want, but it's a 1/3 shot to be basically eliminated from the game to get a couple extra spaces of movement. This is lame. I can see where it might develop into something interesting if you played long sequences of games, but I just don't think there is enough game here to justify that sort of investment. Breaking Away is a vastly superior cycling game.

A shame, I really wanted to like this one, and the tracks are great. But the game itself just doesn't quite work, I don't think, neither as a game nor as much of a simulation beyond the superficial flash.

As a final note, this is one horrendous rules set.

Very clever experience game that gives a real feel for cycling. I'm not sure I'd want to replay the same layouts styles too often, but there should be enough variety.

I did wonder if a lot of it came down to a few key die rolls or collection of energy at the food points. I doubt I'll play it enough to judge.

I enjoy racing games, although bicycling isn't probably my number one theme. Leader 1 works well.  I especially like the specializations of the 3 types of riders. Its most interesting when one player controls a team of 3 and tries to use them to slingshot someone to the finish line.

The components are great and there is a great deal of variability. Yet, something just was lacking for me in this game in the fun factor. I guess I felt like my decisions were fairly straightforward and the outcome hinged on a few lucky/unlucky draws. 

I like it more as a fun experiental game, but not so much as a serious endeavor.

Nice thinky racing game.  Sort of a spiritual successor to Bolide (and perhaps Hare & Tortoise) in its determinism, but with a lot more going on and more interesting choices due to the energy management.

Rating based on a 2-player run (3 bikes apiece) of the suggested first-time track.  For what it's worth, the first rider to break out of the Peloton (well before the uphill) ended up winning, and only one rider ever got re-absorbed (which happened on the final tile).  I'm curious to see how long the game takes with more players on a longer track, although even the short track was enough to provide a solid game.  This could be great for players in a mathy mood.

Players control a team of cyclists riding over a road race stage.  The game is played over a series of rounds where the order of play is "front to back", with a peloton marker representing the main field of riders.  Players off the front of the peloton get to move, the players get a chance to try and break off the peloton, then the player "controlling" the peloton sets the tempo, then the poor cyclists off the back pant along.  The designers are obviously fans of the great European "tours", as it's all here - falls, feeding, energy management, cyclist specialization, team tactics and collaberation, punctures, general classification over many stages.  Beautiful template hexes mean you can build any course you like featuring flats, rolling ground, mountains and descents.  Tiny, fragile cyclist miniatures get placed on the board when you break away or drop off the back, but then you begin using your own energy reserves rather than getting a tow in the peloton.  Only played a couple of games but very impressed with how the "feel" of cycling is preserved.  If it has a flaw, it needs some sort of hidden energy mechanic ... easily implemented.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The game centers around managing your energy but also choosing your moment carefully for breaking out of the peleton. You might not want to break out too early, since you have very little energy at the end of the day, but you do want to have all your racers out towards the end of the race in order to set up blocks or at very least some slipstreaming options to gain to few, precious extra movement spaces. A little mathematical, but the chaos of other players make up for this. You might be able to plan things to a point, that is until the peleton leader decides to push things or a batch of racers block your path.
Simple, but with certain innovations (the peleton being the prime example), this is a game worth trying even if you're not a racing/sport fan.

Taught to me at a mini-meet.  I was surprised at the poor component value--racers falling off bikes, and the race course is difficult to distinguish the steps/spaces.  The dice rolling for punctures was tedious, repetitive, and boring.  I didn't know anything about bike races and started out poorly, but managed to get closer to the front by the end by slipstreaming and burning my cyclists energy.  Was not too much fun, but am willing to try again as I might rethink strategies and stay a bit longer in the peloton.

When playing one stage only, the beginning is boring because nobody wants to try to break away from the peloton. The end of the stage is always interesting though.

We usually count points for each rider in a team; 1st place gets 1, 2nd place 2, etc. - team with lowest total wins. This helps keep the interest even for those players whose rider can't win a stage.

Definitely want to try the Tour mode someday and hoping it will make taking care of each rider even more meaningful and thus interesting.

Since I had just played Breaking Away (another bike race game) the night before and found the play so rewarding, I was really excited to compare it to Leader 1, because superficially Leader 1 looks far more promising. Was I ever in for a surprise!

Comparison of Leader 1 to Breaking Away:
* Both have pencil & paper record keeping.
* Both can play up to 10.
* Leader 1 has extremely more complicated moving rules & calculations are aided by several charts.
* Leader 1 has track events; Breaking Away does not.
* The game Leader 1, plays the part of the Peloton which is moved by a die, whereas in Breaking Away it is created by the players. 
* Both recognize "breaking away" and slipstream movement.
* Breaking Away is pure strategy. Leader 1 introduces luck with dice.
* Breaking Away includes a tutorial for the beginning of a race. Leader 1 does not.
* Breaking Away has a circular, flat track. Leader 1 has double-sided landscape hexes, with different terrain and the ability to alter steepness. 
* Both games have bicycle components. 
* Breaking Away is homemade & self-published; Leader 1 is a commercial publication.

I printed out "Leader 2" rules here on BGG which includes solo play, which is what I played. I found the original rules in English translation, impossible. It also helped to print out a glossary (again here on BGG) of biking terms.

I lost horribly to the Peloton (group of bikes)--unreasonably so, which makes me think I still do not have the rules correct. I admit that one game is not enough to base a rating, especially one this complicated & confusing. However, I spent 10 hours on this game and a lot of these thoughts are fresh in my mind. I need to play again, but I won't unless other players join to help interpret the rules. Perhaps the rating would rise?

I love the ability to create endless track combinations with the different terrain, and it looks nice. This is all I can say in its favor. 

The bikes look nicer than the ones in Breaking Away, but are disappointing because of their fragility--two came broken and most of the rest had to be glued since they kept falling apart. The rules and calculations are too complicated. The events add reality, but complicate the game even more. I don't like the luck element the dice introduce. This game desperately needs a tutorial or video. The rules should have a glossary included, and not assume we know biking jargon. And really, a die with stickers, in a $60 game? Come on.

For a biking game, I am a Breaking Away fan. The car racing game, Formula D, has mechanics closer to Leader 1 than Breaking Away. I find Formula D is a much, much, much easier game to play.

This game was not fun; this game was work. Sorry Leader 1, I really wanted to like you.

Well, I bought this game with very very high hopes.  The Rules are truly a PoS!  Who translated these?  I am searching the web for a clear set of rules in English.  Otherwise, the physical quality is fantastic.  The playing pieces are a little to flimsy and cheap.  Some of my pieces don't even fit together and the QC person still shoved them in the plastic pak.  Not impressed.

So far, I have not played it enough to really judge if it is a cute game or a good cycle game.  I will change my rating in time to reflect this.  Right now, I gave it a poorer rating because the rules are crap and some of my game pieces are defective.

Regardless, it is a gorgeous looking game and a great idea.

Great game!  I enjoyed playing my first game and watching the breakaway melt down, and then my second with a little help, and seeing how the breakaway could survive by working together.  And then my third, with the breakaway pulling far from the peleton, but the race getting very tight at the end. The components are excellent and it appears that this game will allow quite a bit of variety depending on the terrain and the difficulty of the mountains.

Good components, nice peloton-mechanic gives the game a quite realistic bicycle-race feeling. Modular board gives the opportunity to create endless variety of stages and races. These points make Leader 1 stand above "Um Reifenbreite", "Peloton" or "Die Tour".

Played once, was very promising.  Downside is it isn't that good with more than 5 players.  You need to take 2 or 3 bikes each for the game to have any strategic depth at all.  Its also a little too mathy.  You spend your turn staring at the board and then mathing out your move.  

However, it really captures the tour de france feel very well.  Things like the strategy of when to leave the pack, pacing yourself, etc. really come into play and accurately represent bike racing.

Play with 5 or less so you can use multiple bikes.  Lots of strategy in drafting off of your team members, when to pass, etc.  Very fun game.

A reasonable simulation of road cycling (and it is more of a simulation than a game), but there's simply no incentive (other than simple boredom) to break away from the peloton until the game's half over, and that's no game at all. Hazards like punctures are luck-based, but can put you out of contention. Don't be over-ambitious when laying out the track or you're looking at a 2.5 hour playing time and that's far too much for such a simple system. A modest improvement over Um Reifenbreite, but this remains a weak genre.

A bicycle racing game. Probably more interesting with fewer players; we played with six, so we only got to control one rider apiece.  The game is all about using energy at the right time and is pretty thematic, and it's relatively simple once you get past the convoluted and poorly translated rules. It was sort of long and silly.  I'm not a big fan of racing games generally, so I wasn't a big fan of this one either.  (1 play)

I really, really liked this as a bicycle racing game.  The theme was done well and the mechanic of breaking away racers (of differing abilities over varying terrain) from a pelleton in constant pursuit was a great mechanic.

The rules were a bit of a challenge to interpret.

Would like to give it another go now that I have a feel for the rules.

initial rating 3 players Essen 08

A very thematic offering with nice touches here and there like being able to adjust the time of the game and 21 modular track pieces to keep you going. We actually played on the 3D model in the picture which was pretty nifty. 

Comparisons to Formula De or more aptly Um Reifenbreite are of course unavoidable, it largely did remind me of UR and in the good ways. The is one big unique difference here that sets it apart from any other race games, the Peleton mechanic which was brilliantly implemented. This really brought a race sim to the next level closely mimicing what happens in a real bike rice. I'm no bike fan but this was a very cool inclusion. 

The Peleton (group of riders who stay together to save energy) really drives the game, tactics revolve largely around when to breakaway and also where to breakaway or actually where/when to be swallowed back up again. There is some push your luck in this process as when you breakaway you determine how far, farther costs you more energy, not far enough and the group might catch back up thus you become part of the group once again. 

The terrain effects were largely similiar to UR but again there is one BIG difference here again, certain terrain affects certian riders differently. You have three specialists on your team and each one has its own strengths and weaknesses in the different terrains which was another nice inclusion. 

We were told this game was 16 years in development, I think it shows and we had fun in our one playing. There might be a little less luck than in both FD or UR, sometimes you are choosing to push your luck by trying to save time riding on cracked pavement and this will subject you to risk, just as it would in a real race. 

Summary - Easy buy for bike race fans, sports fans in general might like it, one of the best race games I have played to date and I've played some notible titles.

RATING: 7.5
This is very good - a better racing game than Formula De, even.  

Put down the wrenches and let me explain.  There's a similar amount of chrome in the system, but because of the nature of the sport, it results in more (and better) tactical decisions.  Also, if you watch enough cycling to know, situationally, how breakaways suceed and fail, that's replicated with eery effect here.

Downsides - you're not getting a newb into this.  Daytona 500 is the (solid) choice for them.  Also, the little plastic cyclists are cute, but flimsy.  Have some superglue handy.  The rest of the components are excellent, though.

Based on one 6p play.  
Great components - esp. the modular board system.  Some neat ideas with the energy management system, but there are way too many rules that SLOW DOWN the game.  What's a racing game if it's not fast?

Also, the strength of the game seems to be it's lack of chance, but in the game I played the little chance there is (the energy drinks, peleton, & crash die) made a HUGE impact on the outcome of the game.  Enough that the energy management system was pretty much an afterthought.

Leader 1 doesn't strike me as a well designed game: combination of a long, dry & mathematical game and a game changing random element is uneasy at best. Things are not helped by the fact that most of the race is spent in the peloton, which basicly means that you are doing absolutely nothing for most of the game.

Um Reifenbreite is tons more fun and Breaking Away is a much better analytical game.

This game is definitely for the cyclying racing fan. As someone who is not a cycling fan, I found it to be too in depth for a game, and it should have been a little bit more abstracted.  It almost kind of felt like Power Grid in that it gets very mathy near the end.  I would rather just stick with UR, fits the bill just as well, and plays much quicker, and is easier to get new players up and running with the game.

I was the only one in the group who knew anything about bike racing, so I had a bit of an advantage, using my climber to good effect to be in the lead going into the final downhill stretch.  Unfortunately, some stupid play on my part as well as a miss-played rule meant that I finished third out of four. Oh well.  I would very much like to play again.

Cycle racing game that is very easy to learn and play and gives a nice simulation of the real thing.

Very thick and nicely rendered board game tiles - very fragile bikes and riders. As a race game I prefer this to Formula D.

The peloton works nicely but otherwise there's not that much improvement over Um Reifenbreite, except for the modular board. The board hexes are huge! The way in which flat tires occur does not work thematically at all.

The rules are written in very bad English; I had to check the German version on several occasions to figure out the actual rules. That does not help with the numerous ambiguities, though. Also, there's absolutely no mention of winning the game. You'd think that's the first thing to add when writing rules... 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.4
A good game overall.  Some weak points in design include the rules for puncture, which are completely random and not of a risk/reward nature.  In fact, do NOT use puncture rules if you are racing just one race; use it only for a series of races.

Also, sprint zones are too small.  Be sure to count the ENTIRE final tile as a sprint zone to balance out the downhill specialty, which is otherwise the better choice 95% of the time.

Good cycle race simulation which has enough well thought out elements to capture the feel of a road race. I especially like the peloton mechanic and the modular board, though the cyclists are a little fragile. It can get bogged down by the more analytical minds especially as the key decision on when to break away can really determine the outcome. Lots of scope for playing a series of races - where I think this game will really shine.

Good racing game.  Oddly, it slows down at the end of the race but plays very fast at the beginning.  It does a nice job of simulating racing and keeps everyone in the game every turn.  The great mechanic is the peloton.  It cruises along and can suck back in any break away racers that don't keep their lead.  Racers that break away have to make judicious use of their energy points or risk falling back into the peloton.  It also has a small modular hex map that doesn't need a huge table top to play and offers lots of new combinations.

Great peloton rules, and fantastic bits, but the game's too mathy for mine. For a race game, there's too much counting out when you're trying to work out the best time to breakaway, and the optimum moves once you're out of the peloton. And if you're not playing a tour, then everyone's committed to the end-game breakaway which doesn't make for much surprise. Still, it has a cycling feel. Jury's delivered ... lot's of theme, but not enough decision points to make it an interesting game.

RATING: 8
Probably the best bicycling racing game system out there, except for the upgraded Ghenos games dubbed "Leader 2" system. Cyclists have varying strengths and weaknesses, and have energy to spend for extra movement. Movement of the  cyclists is NOT DICE-BASED NOR CARD-DRIVEN. Variable track has 4 different types of "terrain". Most of the information is open. Some of the race is the mini-game of planning how and when cyclists successfully break away from the Peloton. It's very cool that it includes materials to play a tour of games.

Okay 2 player. Probably best with 4. The components are fragile. The rulebook needs work for it's translation and for its terminology heaviness. It's not even clear what the rule is for winning. The player aids need a bit more. The board hex pieces are quality and wonderful, but it is difficult to tell what markings are nice drawings vs. subtle functional game symbols (e.g. Peloton path marks, darkened risk spaces). A redo of this game could possibly launch to a place within the top 10 most popular racing games.

I played with the 6+ player variant where everyone controlled one bicycle.  This game has some interesting features, but I'm not a huge fan of race games.  It seemed like the players who did the best were the ones who stayed with the pelaton, but doing so was pretty boring as you basically didn't get any turns while doing so.  In no event did taking a "risk" seem worth it: in every case failure was catastrophic.  The rules seemed poorly written.

I love the Leader 1 family as a wonderfully implemented racing simulation that captures the cycling theme perfectly. It has a very nice blend of resource management, variability of events and the chasing peloton through an inobtrusive use of dice and a push your luck mechanism for falling or getting tired on the mountains.

The modular game board is great. The cyclist bits keep breaking in the original Leader 1, but I applaud the detail of the miniatures.

I think the Hell of the North re-implementation is better by a little bit, but the difference is small.

This is the ultimate simulation of a bicycle road race. Nothing comes close. That said, Breaking Away offers an equally compelling cycling race game. They can't be compared though. This game has so many complexities it will be a long time before all its strategies are understood. I wouldn't bother with the flat rule. I've played it with 3 bikes (2 players) and 5 players (1 bike). The game goes faster when players have only one bike to manage. Both games played had sprint finishes. Great fun!

If you like bikes and boardgames go and get this. Otherwise, think whether you need another race game. This is in the math-heavy end with Breaking Away and has very little randomness, unless you decide to push your luck where suddenly the dice of death rears it ugly head! Quite simple, but probably needs dedication to be seen at its best: manage a team of 3 riders through a series of races and it would be quite interesting - but it will also occupy quite a few gaming sessions.

Not my cup of tea. The peleton movement and leaving it and rejoining it, didn't add up to a very exciting race. It is more like the real thing, a bit boring to watch until the end legs. The big dash at the end didn't make the front game worth it in the end, for my group.

Okay, so I'm biased because I love cycling. This is a very good simulation that's light on the maths and quick with the right group. With enough players who understand how professional cycling works (four or five teams), you'll get some interesting alliances between groups that dissolve just as quickly as they do in real cycling. As a stage race this is especially fun. I don't think it matters which of the cyclists you take - you just have to play the different combinations to their strengths. So, fun and clever.

A race game with minimal use of dice (the crack-fall-puncture rules are really random though), and it works! No lead is safe in the game, and it's really tense throughout.

Wish it had included some elements from Um Reifenbreite (stronger team aspect, blocking, sprints), as they would have made this the undisputed #1 cycling game.

I really wanted to like this game.  And I think it is actually a pretty good game.  If you set up a series of races and keep up with points for players, I imagine this would be a very interesting game.  In fact, that seems to be how the game is intended to be played.  However, as a single race game, there really is not all that much to recommend this.  It seems to be too strongly slanted toward racing as a team to make for an interesting or satisfying one-off.  

That said, there are several things I do like.  I like the peloton and its movement.  I also like the risking mechanic in the game.  The modular board is great.  Unfortunately, I somewhat prefer Tour to this.  I may still pick it up in the future, though.  [01/08/2011]

This game has a serious rules overhead for such a straightforward racing game, but it is worth the effort.  There are some really great decisions to be made and it keeps you on the edge of your seat as the Hugo-like peloton starts catching up to you.

My only gripe about the game is the penalty in the mountains, in order to win you have to push through the mountains (especially as the peloton has no requirement to go slow and it can catch up quick).  So if you get a bad break on the dice, more bad rolls compound quickly as the odds go up that you will crack again.  So bad rolls in the mountain can really mean more to winning or losing the game than any of the great stuff you did along the way.  I will be playing with a x2 penalty from now on rather than a x3.

Very disappointing game. Boring to death.

Components are good.

I understand that this game can some how work as a good simulation and I can agree with this statement because I also think that cycling can be the most fastidious sport in the whole world right after equestrianism! Leader 1 has absolutely no interesting decisions to make apart from that first setup decision on which man will be sprinter, mountain expert or overall balanced guy. And even these decisions are not that important because the rest of the race doesn't leave any space for creativity and decision changing. Every player should do the obvious and if you don't there shouldn't be any problem with that because it happens the same thing all over the game. 

One of the most terrible gaming experiences I've ever had but with this important disclaimer: I really hate cycling!

Bought 10-2-2009 (Central de Jocs).
I'm a sucker for cycling games. As a kid I used to love the Tour so much (ah! thouse July afternoons at the sofa following the Tourmalet ascension...), until the medical aspect of the sport became so tricky.
Perhaps I should develop some home rules about medical innovations. UPDATE: Done (http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/385109)
We have begun an stage race http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/386431

Superb simulation of a Tour de France race. Game play is straightforward but the overall effect is one that simulates a race stage very accurately. Rewards good play and timing is essential.

An excellent cycle racing game. It's all about energy management, conserving your energy and breaking at the right time will produce dividends. Plenty of demanding decisions to take throughout and an exciting finish.

All 4 terrains play very differently. 

The componenents are generally exceptional. The bikers will plenty of glue to begin with though.

The 21 double sided tiles ensure mountains of variety and replayability. 

The rules out of the box make for fine game.  But there is also plenty of scope for house rules to add to the simulation experience.

Leader 1 should be the last bycicle race game that you will ever want to buy.

Excellent cycling game. Probably the best of the 'Euro/move all the riders' school. A bit of Homas, some Metric Mile, great narrative and believable outcomes. Some quirky rules, but nothing too painful. 

Very nice production, especially the maps. Cyclists a bit fragile.

I would have given it a higher rating if it hadn't come so close to some of my ideas!

Very good cycling simulation. Teamwork, tactics, diplomacy, a little bit of luck.
Good materials, even if you're not into cycling races, you may want to give it a try. It would be nice to find suggested tracks available on the net.

Good bicycle game. The rules are poorly written & I needed to download a rules redo so that you can make decent sense out of them. But, other than that, the game plays well & is fun.

Given to me by user DearVienna. I'm psyched!  My dad is a huge cycling fan and a gamer, so I'm always on the lookout for games that will get his attention.  I'd be pretty excited myself as I like racing games, but that's an added bonus.

Rating is tentative, but so far I'm a big fan.  The components are super cool (I love the course tiles) and the cyclist minis are nice even though mine keep falling off their bikes.  The gameplay is fascinating -- the decisions made over the course of the race can feel inconsequential and/or hard to puzzle out, and then the finish so far has always been an absolute nail-biter and it's clear that the player who won earned the victory.  I don't have anything else like it!

This has similarities to Speed Circuit, but creating your own courses and such gives you more flexibility. It probably works best when playing a whole tour. When playing just one race, there will be some courses where breaking away a certain type of racer will never make sense.

Rulebook is pretty poor. And, since it seems that most of the discussion on the forums here is about the so-called "Leader 2" variant, no help there in figuring out what the original rules are.

Racing game whose tie between theme and gameplay is better than average (especially surprising for a sport simulation).
Some tactic and some luck.
The modular board enhances replay value.

Excelente juego deportivo carente totalmente de azar. Brilla principalmente si se juega en modo campa√±a aunque para echarse una carrera de vez en cuando tambi√©n est√° muy bien. No es imprescindible que te guste el ciclismo para disfrutarlo :)

RATING: 9
Great cycling game. Really captures both the strategy, tactics and feel of real cycling (at least as far as I understand them simply from watching Tour De France every year and with no other interest in cycling). - But this may also be why many do not like the game - nothing much may happen for a long time, but near the end an earlier,  small mistake, wrong choice/use of the different rider types, poor timing, or simply a bit of inefficiency may cost you the victory when you run out of energy just before the goal line.

RATING: 6
Very reminiscent of "Um Reifenbreite", but this one is actually better due to the modular board and the nice peloton mechanics. Nice blend between strategy, luck and co-operation between various players.
After the re-implementation done in "Leader 1 - Hell of the North", I think that the original ruleset is not up to par with the new one. The original is still good to have for the hexagon tiles which are different from the one in the new revision.

Pretty dull. Staying in the peleton for much of the race seems to make good sense, and where's the fun in that? It might be better with fewer players who have more experience so things move faster, but I don't intend to find out.

RATING: 7.6
Not since Um Reifenbreit has a bicycle racing game been this engaging.  The individual strengths and weaknesses add a nice strategic planning depth to the game.  The components are top notch as well.  Congratulations to Ghenos for another engaging game.

Very good representation of bicycle racing. The peleton system has been missing from all similar games. It is fiddly but once everyone understands the movement rules the game speeds up.

Fantastic production and component quality.  I like the energy aspect and how it simulates the cyclist's endurance throughout the course.  However, it's a real shame that racing games still can't get away from being controlled by the luck of a die roll.  Even with four players there were a significant amount of downtime.  Better than most I've played from this genre.

After 5 plays i think it's better to play more stages for more strategic desisions. for now from 8 to 7. I think it's to less benefite when you choose a sprinter.

A good solid racing game. Though the strategies might be evident after a few plays, so it might all come down to the luck of dice.

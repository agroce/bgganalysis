RATING: 8
Excellent game with no real flaws. It's a perfect introduction for young kids into the world of meatspace gaming. It's simple enough to be accessible, yet it has just the right amount of strategy to be fun. The arithmetic elements are great for toddlers. My wife and I play with our 4 year old daughter and she absolutely loves it. She lives for slapping down that knight and stealing queens.

My wife and I even enjoy playing each other for quick, low-commitment fun (games typically last 10-15 minutes). Highly recommended for anyone.

A short, silly little card game that is actually pretty fun for a game thought up by a six year old.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Rated for young kids 6+ because they love it and can play it.  Adults can play too, but would not play on their own.  However, this has a surprising amount of take-that for a young kid game and older kids can be particularly vicious with younger kids leading to tears.

This is a nice light fast game which is easy for children to play.
There is too much luck involved to get much out of it for grown ups.
The two reasons I like this game, though, are the equations made to get rid of number cards and the fairly bengin screwage factor.  My eldest daughter is very non confrontational, so I am glad she likes this game.

Picked this up in a charity shop. It's OK, and better than a lot of kids games with standard playing cards. A few odd gotchas that could have done with icons added to the cards (Cat an Dog queen for example.)

We play allowing more advanced maths now my kids are a little older.

April 2015: My almost 5 years old son's favourite card game (one of his first). He mastered it in no time (without additions though), can play without adults and actually win with them. With this game, he has learnt how to lose which scores high in my book. Although almost decision-less and too random for adults, it is still a pleasure to play with kids every so often and to see the tactics they develop.

May 2015: Still fresh and enjoyable after countless plays. Excellent filler just before bed time (does not drag for too long and can be easily finished by getting all the queens asap). We have selected it as a birthday gift for a few other children.

My 7 and 5 year olds like to play this and will play against each other on their own, so it gets good marks from that point of view. It's colourful, encourages my five year old to do sums and I am happy to play it with them, though in truth there is little to hold the attention. Rating based on my children's enjoyment would be higher!

My daughter received this game as a Christmas gift, and we have had fun with it. My wife, 5 y.o. and 9 y.o. love it, and would play it continuously -- my 13 y.o. and I enjoyed it, but found that it got old after a couple of plays. Great game for kids, though!

- I enjoy playing it with my 9 year old daughter
- The artwork is cute but not lazy
- The cards are good quality
- The rules are easy to learn
- The match component of getting rid of number cards is excellent

This is a pretty good game for pre-schoolers. Simple mechanics and the idea of making equations with numbers up to 10 is a good way to reinforce basic math concepts. Very random, but there's some strategy in considering whether to keep cards like wands or dragons.

Rating as a children's game - for just adults it would be a 3 or a 4. My 4 year old just loves this game, wants to play it all the time, only alteration we made to the rules was ditching the maths and instead you can discard pairs and triples of the number cards. Short and simple enough my two can play on their own, but just enough depth to keep their interest. 

Update - my daughter is now 8 and this sees less and less play now. But it was played to death in her earlier years.

This is a great little card game.  A little math, a little mystery, and some good old fairy tale are crafted into this little game.  Picked this up for my mom for a Christmas gift and it became one of our favorites when we wanted a quick game to play.  The story of how the game was created (by a child with parental assistance) is fantastic!  Who could  not like the Pancake Queen and her buttery thighs?  My wife, mother, and I will play this game any time we need a light filler.

Fun theme, fun game.  I was worried only my 5 year old daughter would enjoy it, but her 8 year old brother loves it, as well as her three boy cousins aged 7-11.  Nice artwork.  My only complaint is that the cards are cheap and the edges fray quickly in easily recognized ways, so that the queens' identities are not secret any more for us, even when they are face down.

Also, the stealing card element can hurt some feelings with the younger crowd.

Very simple card game that teaches a little bit of math in adding up cards to total another card to draw at least 3 cards instead of the usual 1 or 2 cards. The game has a number of special ability cards as well that drive you towards the end game. The theme is fun and engaging for my daughter. She got most of it playing open handed a few times so I think we're ready to switch to close hands with maybe a little bit of prompting from me. She enjoyed it so it will stick around.

I admit that I'm happy with the math practice for my daughter. -Later- Whoa! Now this is my four-year-old's favorite game (I was speaking earlier of my six-year-old, who really enjoys it too). -2 years later- Back into the rotation. Roleplaying (fierce knights, hissing dragons, musical magic wands) is essential!

What I imagine to be my final note on this game: I asked my younger daughter (now 8) if she was ready to give this game up. "No! Even when I no longer want to play it, I'm going to put it in my keepsake box!" Kudos to the designer, publisher, and artist.

Rated for kids.  My 4 1/2 y.o. daughter's favorite game.  A "10" for her as she will currently play it anytime, anywhere.  My 7 y.o. son enjoys this as well.  Great family game that has helped get us all together in the evening for some family time and has led to playing even more games.  We also take this along any time we'll need to be sitting for awhile and need to fill the time.  Fun artwork - highly recommended game for kids.  One of Gamewright's best!
Addendum:  This and Pick Picknic have been great games for helping my 4 y.o. to learn to add small numbers in her head.

My daughter is now 10 and still loves this game.  We just purchased the 10th anniv. edition and the new queens and kings are a hit!

Edited 7/14/14. After about 2.5 years, this game has stood the test of time with my 3 girls. All three (ages 4-6.5) will play it with me and/or my wife, but not usually just with each other. I've logged many plays, but not all, so this is definitely the most played game in the collection.

Rating from a kid's perspective.

This was the first Gamewright game I stumbled onto via Amazon.  My 3-year-old son mastered it and loves it.  We had to modify the scoring rules (we just play until all the queens are awake).  

It's more complex than an Uno, teaches some strategy, has some suspense and memory.  Keeps me engaged as the parent playing.  After a while, he has started playing with his cousins and friends with no adults.  

Because of this game, we now own a lot of Gamewright games.

Nice game for young players. Fairly easy to learn. Involves a fair amount of luck, but the luck can sway from one player to another as one player awakens a number of queens, other players can steal queens or put them back to sleep.There is some strategy that allows players to prevent queens being stolen or being put back to sleep, but again this is highly dependent on the draw of the cards.

Though this game is primarily marketed to kids, I have to say that as an adult gamer there's quite a bit to like here. Though it suffers from the same pitfalls that are typical to card-drawers, the game requiring some amount of memorization and reads of your opponent's hand elevates it above its no-skill peers. Don't get me wrong, Sleeping Queens isn't brain surgery by any means, and this wouldn't hit the table among a group of hardcore gamers, but there's slightly more to it than just drawing and laying down cards. The art style is also vibrant and appealing and has led to some funny reactions. The short length makes this a competent light filler game in a crowd consisting of kids and non-gamers.

Sleeping Queens is good for a child learning addition.  The age states 8+, but I believe it is better for a younger child.  The graphics on the cards are cute and it is a quick and easy game to play with kids.  It is a game of luck, but kids have fun stealing Queens away from you or putting them back to sleep.

RATING: 10
This is my kids' favorite parlor (card) game.

I don't play it with them much, but it is completely harmless and picturesque fun and captivates their imaginations. They play it over and over on their own. I'm glad the boys like to play a fun game in which they can include their little sister.

Great bang for the buck. Highest recommendation.

Cute concept. My kids (7 & 9) are currently crazy about it, but I'm already over it. Little strategy, too much random, no way to take down the leader if they're too far ahead. That said however we have had more than a few close games that the fam has enjoyed...

The girls played this at Card Kingdom and loved it, so I picked it up.  It's a great game to play with the kids, and it involves simple math problems with the cards.  I'd change the low age to 5 or 6, but not lower due to the addition and subtraction.  Despite my positive rating (for kids), this is not a game for adults to play alone, but I do have exponentially more fun playing this than say Chutes and Ladders or Candy Land.

Reluctantly, I acknowledge this game is at least worth a look. Kids seem to like it, I suspect in large part because of the take-that and matching defense card, and because the rules take about 2 minutes or less to explain. It's a nice touch how the game encourages you to do a bit of light math. So in the end I'd recommend trying out some other game instead, but that's just my opinion.

Great family game to play with young children, and rated as such. Helps to also develop math by simple addition.
A little bit of strategy and easy to adapt with house rules to prevent holding onto several defensive cards, e.g FLIGHT OF DRAGONS! (Play 3 dragons that patrol your kingdom).

New game for our 4 year old, and so far she loves it!  Right now we're just playing to get 5 queens (not using their points), and my daughter will show me her number cards so I can help her with equations.  (yes, not very strategic, but I like that she's getting to practice addition) I may try the variation using number sequences too.

Luck-driven filler that does teach kids math, turn order, special card interaction, and so forth.  I like it for those reasons.  Adults would not play this without kids, but this is a game with merit for children to play.

Again, luck will rule who wins, as there is no method of hand intel to time your knights and potions, but still...repeat after me, "It's miles better than Candyland."  (The mantra of any parent who plays games with their children).

I don't mind playing it over and over with my kids- and they think it's great.

Kid-oriented card game, and it has a new edition out with 16 queens instead of the original 12.  My kids love it.  They love the artwork, and always try to awaken or steal their favorites based on which queen is prettiest or has the best name/theme, not which one is worth the most points.  For adults, it's fun the first few games, but the strategy-to-luck ratio tilts ~95% to luck.  But it's always fun to play with the kids.

Excellent game for young kids. Currently my 5-year-old's favorite. He loves defending his queens by slapping down the dragon and wand cards. Lots of laughs in this game. Works for both boys and girls. Addition option to trade in cards is a nice, little incentive to do a little math. 

Artwork is very well done. Cards, however, could be a little more heavy-duty or better quality, but for the price they're ok.

It's amazing that a six year old was able to design a game, let alone an enjoyable one.

Sleeping Queen is about getting good action cards to gather (=wake) queens. A small calculation exercise is included to get rid of worthless number cards. Take that-cards stealing away the queens prolongue the game until one player lucks into achieving the victory condition without getting bothered. Certainly fine as a children's game. Played with adults, it's superfluous to annoying.

Update: My little girl is now 6 and we're still playing this game! :)

I played this game with my first daughter 10 years ago and loved it back then. A few months ago I pulled it out to play with my youngest daughter (currently 4) and she loves it too. This is an adorable game with cute graphics and excellent game play that keeps both adults and children interested. Of all the kids games I've played, this is a top 3 favorite. We purchased the 10 year anniversary tin which comes with 4 new queens and 2 new kings and love this newer version too!

Bought this as a birthday present for my son when Loot was not available from my local games store. Have had plenty of games with both son and daughter, one game never being enough for either of them. No issues with the theme being too girly. The only annoying thing about the game is the randomness of the juggling jokers that can finish games too quickly. Also a good game for when guests arrive.

A light, whimsical game with terrific artwork that should appeal to most kids and be tolerable to most adults. A nice fit for those nights when you want something relaxing that plays quickly and allows you to talk while you play. A pretty good entry in the category of kids game that won't make the adults cry. Bonus points for its method of incorporating simple math that helps kids but doesn't annoy adults. A fantastic value for a $1 clearance buy.

My six year old Daughter's new favorite.  Easy rules and the card play is pretty obvious for her to grasp.  There's an addition mechanic involved in the play of some cards so it has an educational aspect.  There's also a stealing mechanic that can cause some confrontation (and tears)between players (you don't want to steal my daughter's pink poodle queen).  This is a good game to start kids on after memory games lose their charm.

I can't say I quite know what the point is of this, but it seems entertaining enough for the target age range, and might even appeal to a slightly broader range than the average Gamewright offering. There's a little strategy (hand management); there's some practicing math facts; it's innocuous. If you have a little one who would enjoy the theme, it seems like a decent choice.

This is ok, but really is a kids game. I find that there is basically zero strategy and only a minor level of tactical play.  But some of that might be cause my nephew is still playing with his cards spread out in front of him :) On the other hand, the kids love it and its been a real catalyst for them asking me to bring other games and nagging their relatives to play too.  Long term adult fun - low, long term family gaming and time together - 10.

This is a light kids game with a whimsical feel.  It is quick and everyone has a good time.  We play with a couple of house rules: any mathmatical formula is good and the black knight steals two queens. My kids favorite parts are waking up the Rose Queen, because you get to wake up another Queen and when the dragon eats a knight.  Yum, yum!

I'm excited to play this one with the offspring in a few years. It was a nice little filler for grown-ups, but I probably won't suggest it often. It's a card game with some pretty interesting hand-management mechanics, and just enough 'gotcha' cards to keep it interesting in an Ameritrashy sort of way. The memory mechanic allows for some small amount of strategy. The artwork is very nice (quirky) as well.

Kids card game where you try to wake up queens and keep them.

There is a memory component, but largely you are waking queens and trying to get either 5 of them or an amount worth 50 points or more.

To get new cards, you either discard pairs, or by adding/subtracting 2 cards and having the answer (5+3=8; discard 5,3,8).

RATING: 9
Rated as a game for children.

Quick and enjoyable card game; although it's rated for ages 8 and up, don't let that scare you.  My four-year-old can play, though the math side is a little complicated for her (so we don't play with the addition problems and make all of the queens equal in value).  Still, she gets the concepts and the colorful artwork is right up her alley.

In this children's game, there are 12 queen's face down on the table. On a player's turn they can play a king to wake one of them up, and move them over to your side of the table. Queen's range in points from 5 to 20, and the first player to get 5 queens or 50 pts wins the game. You can play a knight to take a queen from another player, but they can be defended by dragons. You can play a potion to put a queen to sleep, but they can be defended by wands. You can play a jester to get a special card or randomly heand out a queen. Finally, the deck is filled with numbers from 1-10. You can discard pairs or three cards if two of the cards sum up to the third. 

There is a lot of luck, and a small amount of math. Yet my 6 year old daughter really enjoyed it.  It does introduce the idea of "take that" with some defence. I would prefer if there was more math involved, but I will play it if my daughter wants to play.

Friends of us own a couple of Gamewright games marked for ages 8 and up, and we tried a bunch in a short time span (next to this one also Zeus on the loose, Mermaid Beach, Dragonwood and There's a Moose in the House). Out of that group, this is the only one that both me and my kids considered good enough for multiple plays (my kids also liked the sillyness of "Moose", but that's just not enough game for me to enjoy), so we went out and bought Sleeping Queens ourselves.
I don't see myself playing this with only adults ever, therefore the rating is lower than if I would judge it as strictly a kids game (it would get another star then).

Kings and queens! This is an awesome little filler game for kids as well as adults. The name is a bit misleading...suggesting it might be a girls game only...but it is not! This is a very fast game of collecting queens with the most points. The artwork is funny and food oriented (i.e the pancake queen or the cookie king). But there are also cards like the Rose Queen, Cat Queen, Dog Queen, Tie Dye King, etc. Anyway, the mechanics of the game, as well as the artwork make this a little gem that we enjoy.

RATING: 5
Nice kids game and the length is perfect at 10 minutes. The aim is to collect 40/50 points in queen cards (or 4/5 of the 12 available, valued between 5 and 20) by drawing and playing cards, be they 'get queen' cards or by 'steal from another player' cards where you hope they don't have a matching 'defence' card. You don't get as many of these good cards as you want though because there's a bunch of non-useful 1-10 cards, but in a nod to the target market, you can discard multiple cards in one go if you can get them to add up and total (eg a 3, 4 and 7), allowing parents to get some feelgood at this slightest of educational bents. You generally want to keep discarding until you have a strong hand and then go for the win to minimise the steals against you, but there's obviously a heap of luck in the game. Kids pick it up fast and really like it, especially the target market a couple of years either side of 7 years old, and anyone can win. Good kids game.

I cannot overstate just how much my children (ages 8 and 4) enjoy this game.  This is the rare game in which the 4 year old can play well and the 8 year old is perfectly engaged.  

Even I have to admit that I enjoy playing with them, though I do have to handicap myself by adding an extra queen or an extra 10 points to my win condition.  I originally gave my son (the younger child) an advantage of one queen and 10 points, but he surprised me by managing to learn the necessary arithmetic and didn't need any advantages to win, so we eliminated it.  

An excellent and very basic introduction to a "Magic" style game, teaching children the basics of playing cards, countering cards, hand management, and it even teaches some basic math as well.  Highly recommended, especially for very young kids, who can play just fine without doing any math, but might just learn addition by playing this game!

I initially didn't rank this one very high, but with younger kids this one is a winner. Enough strategy that it's not perfectly random, but not overly complex either.

Fairly lite card game that plays quickly. This is not a gamer's game but works well with non-gamers. I have played it with five year olds who are able to nderstand what to do but have no concept of how to win. If the graphics were armies or a dark fantasy setting the game would be better accepted. 

There is a card in the box that claims the game was designed by a six year old girl....yeah right.

excellent game, for girls, boys, and interested parents. Colorful pleasing art, no reading necessary, thematic fun, easy to play and remember - this one's a winner kid's game. We may well need a second copy of this - we are playing it more than any other game ever with our son! And we still have yet to give the 2nd copy to our nieces!
Update - gave the copy to our nieces, and they have been playing and enjoying it, as well.

Update - (raised rating from 8.5 to 9) this has to be one of the (if not the) best games for children around. Pacing, involvement, and game length are all very strong.

Update, many years along - don't make the mistake of thinking this game is just for girls.
And don't think it's just for 6 or 7 year-olds, either -  it scales to both genders and for a wide range of ages, I'd say 4 to 12 years old, easy. And my 13 year old son still loves playing it. 
A good game is a good game.

House rules - 
1) You can discard any number of matching number cards, not just pairs. So if you're stuck with 3 6's you can discard them all during one turn to grab 3 new cards.
2) You can likewise discard any number of matching power cards, if you choose. So if you're stuck with 3 Magic Wands but have no queens out, you could discard all of them and get 3 new cards.

Another discovery in my kids' unplayed games...we've actually played several games of this now. It's actually quite good. There's a great deal of luck involved but there's normally something you can do with the cards in hand to try and turn the tide of the game. Plays extremely fast and takes no more than 1 minute to explain. Plus, it was designed by a 6 year-old...how much more do you need?

Good solid simple family card game.  We adapt the mathematical rules for exchanging number cards in order to make loooooong equations possible.  For a while we were playing this two - three times per day.  It got a little old, but never made me cringe like Candyland or War!

rated as a kids game.  A nice kids game with a lost of luck, but some ability to maneuver, and some basic political interactions.  It's most luck, and has some risk at making people feel picked on, but it's mostly just laughs with occasional choices -- a reasonable balance for a kids game.  Also, the art and charming.

This is a fun game to play with my kids - lots of potential for smack talk as we try to steal queens and counter with dragons. I am thinking of adding more rules for other queens, beyond Rose and Cat/Dog, to spice it up.  There is one cool trick my daughter came up with that I hadn't even thought of - play sleeping potion on the Rose Queen, wake her up with a King the next turn and get an extra queen for the win. Obviously not worth playing with just adults.

This game is an excellent card game for adults to play with kids. I would not play this game with a bunch of adults, too light for my interests, but for something to do with kids it’s amazing. If you want to get your kids into card games you should own this. By kids, I’m talking about a five year old, not sure up until what age it will remain to be fun, but I’m guessing 8 or 9.

It's light and harmless fun for the kids, but there's no real reason for me to play this with them over the other excellent kids' games I have on my shelf. My four year old gets a good think out of the counting, and other than that it teaches kids about timing in a game - building a strong hand and then pushing for the win. Despite the nice art we'd all prefer to play Mau Mau around here.

In the world of BGG, rating this an 8 probably seems crazy, and it would be if this game was to be played only by adults.  However when playing with kids this game is an absolute delight.  My kids (ages 4,6,10,12) love this game.  The artwork is fabulous, turns move quickly, the rules are easy to understand and it helps kids reinforce/learn addition.  This game is one of the very best I have played with my kids.

Wish it were more interesting, and I guess that the theme might appeal to kids, but it doesn't have much cleverness here at all. If you get lucky, you'll get King cards to get queens, or you'll steal them from someone else. Whoever happens to get just lucky enough to amass a sufficient quantity at the right time.wins. In fact, I'd say this is much like a kid's version of Munchkin, but without the enjoyable humor.

RATING: 8
Definitely a game for the kids, but not bad for the parents, either.

Positives: Great artwork with funny character names. The theme is very appealing, and the play is easy enough to accommodate young kids (I would lower the recommended age; a child only needs basic math skills to play independently, and with help or rules adjustments, even younger kids can play). The number cards are a fun way to practice math. The "take that" factor is fun and light enough for kids to handle, and they love it when they're able to counter with a dragon or wand card. 

Negatives: Too much repeated play gets boring (for the adult). The card quality could be higher.

For the intended audience, this game is a hit. My 4-yo loves it, and he's learned how to make simple addition equations. For my 6-yo, we make the math a little more challenging by allowing any equation that can be made with the numbers. It's certainly worth the price.

I like this game.  My daughter is working her way towards being able to do the math portion of the rules, but she really likes collecting queens.

I am not sure why the knights take queens and dragons defend.  Doesn't seem right.  We take out a knight and play it the other way around.  Knight should be defending their queens!

Another random little filler that I think would delight children more. The artwork is good, the rules are easy enough to explain in a couple of minutes, which I think is very important for a filler suitable for children. There isn't too much thinking to be done for this game, so you could actually play while eating . It's mostly about luck and collecting counter-attack cards before you go after those queens with high points. My group played the jester wrong because we didn't give the player who got the picture care another turn. I also feel that playing to 40 points is likely a better idea than playing till all the queens are awaken, because then you would want to stop others from winning, instead of just trying to amass points. Overall acceptable if you don't want to put in too much effort and don't mind a luck-based game. But I definitely would not play more than 3 games of this with adults who have more experience than Uno.

My daughters, 5 and 8, love playing this so far. I have gotten a little tired of it myself. I have to say, I'm tempted to give it a higher rating purely for the artwork. I also love the silly names (Pasta King, Pancake Queen, etc). Despite that, there are very little choices available in the game--and more importantly, no interesting choices--which means it has little replayability to me. 

I'm not surprised my 5 year old likes it, but I have to say--I'm surprised my 8 year old hasn't gotten tired of it yet. We'll see if she does. However, it's a great story (designed by an 8-year old). It's the reason I purchased the game, and it's very inspiring.

Got this for my 7 year old cousin for Christmas 2015, and ended up playing about 20 games on the first day!

A bit more complex than I was expecting, with a variety of cards that do special things and other cards that cancel them (and no text to remind you what does what). My cousin picked it up in no time though, revealing once again that kids are smarter than you think. :)

Lots of randomness but also a little strategy: a bit of set collection, a bit of strategic timing. The art is really funny and fantastic. Overall, a very good game for kids.

Good family-friendly card game.  There is a lot of luck, some memory, some math, and some elements of 'take that!'.  It is fun and easy enough for young players.

christmas 2015 - good level of complexity for eddie at 5yrs with 4 or so unique skills to remember. High hopes for next 12 months and beyond

lifeless CGI art style make me wanna puke - seems prevalent in lots of games now - what are they teaching these kids at art school?!

Very nice little kids game. Lovely art, theme and it's perfectly short! Unfortunately it is not that much fun to play.

I rate it a 6, my daughter rates it an 8.  I can see where girls or young children like this game.  The usual "good game for kids and families," but I'm getting a little tired of it.  Daughter not ready to let it go yet.

When they were younger, my kids (then aged 4 and 8) loved everything about this game:  the card art, the goofy names, stealing their opponents' queens (knights/potions), the gambling (via the Jester cards), and the basic math practice.  Better yet, the game played very quickly.  A big hit.

My 6yo loves this game. Excellent for drilling kids on simple addition. Not so exciting for the adults but still OK because it plays fast. Great artwork.

Rating assumes playing with children. With only adults this is a 2 or 3.

Decent kids game, and my kids enjoy it (and I enjoy playing with them). My issue is that the numbered cards and math problem requirement is not thematically tied in to the game (I should note that the kids don't seem to notice or care). That being said, I will definitely play this with my kids if it is their choice.

I would rate higher as a kid's game, but on its own it isn't stellar.

While it's true that this is a very simple game, my wife loves the queen theme, and we always make up a little story about the motivations of the kings to wake up the queens. Pretty inoffensive filler, I feel it's a nice palate cleanser after playing a heavier game.

I tried hard to get this on EBay, but the price was too rich for my blood.  The entire Microquest series seemed like such a cool idea, and it still does.  I only experienced this game in a quick 2-on-2 duel.  I like the tactical aspect and the fairly simple role-playing aspects.  If I were to experience the system in its full glory (meaning in the Microquest games), the rating would go up even more.  Otherwise, it's a fun filler.  I got to try out a quick [thing=3463][/thing] duel also, and liked this one better because I prefer hand-to-hand combat over spells.  But after playing these, [thing=5206][/thing], [thing=5205][/thing] and many other Metagaming Concepts games, it's pretty obvious that Steve Jackson's games were the on an entirely different level from the others.

Ahhh the good ol' days of gaming. This one was a blast. It really did have a good combat system. Magic too with the Wizards expansion. Its what DD first started out to be. A system where they provided a frame work and you filled in the rest. I loved the little cardboard counters. Eventually ended up hanging on to this after selling off all the old DD stuff just for some quick fix role playing fun to have. Had a few of the little adventure modules like Grail Quest and such. Could play those solo or add a friend to do a little fantasy trip! Tons of fun!

RATING: 8
Besides the suboptimal components, this was a fairly simple yet elegant combat system that turned into a decent RPG called the The Fantasy Trip.  I hold on to it for nostagia, but never get to play these days.   If this was rereleased with miniatures and pretty maps, it would be killer.

RATING: 6
A lot of bang for the buck -- I used this as both a straight up combat game and a supplement for a couple of different RPG systems for which I didn't care for the combat system.

The lack of a decent skill based progression system detracts considerably so it's use as a stand alone RPG system is very limited.  Also, for all it's combat detail it lacks a good system for showing defensive abilities so it's as if you stand still when your opponent takes a swing at you, which prevents me from enjoying this to much.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
An underrated hack & slash simulation from 1977.

There's clever elegance here, and just enough detail to satisfy. The game has a surprising sense of balance: each point allocated to strength reduces your dexterity, and thus your odds at hitting. Every point of armor you add similarly reduces your movement as well as your dexterity.

It covers basics like attacking from behind, charging with spears, and how armor protects but encumbers. Also there's rules for grappling and a few monsters that would challenge a whole group. It all seems very necessary, and shows how much you can do with the system.

Looking forward to another play!

While I started with D&D, I found Melee to be more elegant, credible, and fun. When I Game Mastered for this, the dungeons were more than dropping into rooms where ogres were just waiting around to battle.  Melee and its Scenarios made for quick and fun game play.

RATING: 4
As a game, there isn't much to recommend it. It's just absolutely pointless bashing. As a combat system, its simplicity has a certain wistful nostalgia, especially after the horror that was GURPS. I don't imagine myself playing a boardgame or an RPG using this but at least it's now available free thanks to Kwanchai.

Using this, Wizard & the books "The Fantasy Trip," me & my friends constructed a very long running fantasy RPG campaign that was amazing. Flexible, yet comprehensive & simple at the same time. The battles, using miniatures & a hex sheet were an amazing improvement over D&D's "changing verbal mental picture shared among 10 people & referee" model. Gave way to GURPS later, which we also used. But still a great hour of fun to just do a gladiator battle or two.

Got another itch to do more Print and Play, so I have made one of my favorite classics!  This remake is so beautiful I just had to share it with everyone.  I printed the optional weapon & armor cards which are very nicely done and takes away some of the paper-work.

This build is pretty simple, The maps, counters and cards are printed on heavy 295gm paper and the counters are further mounted on very heavy "binding cover" cardboard with spray on adhesive.  I printed the cards double-sided.  The colors came out very nicely.  The rule books was printed on standard 80gm paper and binded.

Just played my first game and because of the large hexes and cards and nicely done rules, the game plays much quicker and easier than ever before.  Its a brilliant little tactical combat system that plays remarkably well for its age.  Very slim and sleek!  I just love it!  I hope the talented author remakes wizards and the other fantasy trip modules.  The artwork is very fun and in rejuvenates the overused fantasy stereotypes.

Simple is good.  Possibly the best game Steve Jackson ever made.

Nostalgia vote.  For one year (age 13) I attempted to get into D&D, but the vague, imprecise, GM-makes-it-up style of rules was a turn-off for me.  The TFT system was much better.  Melee is the beginning of that system. Not much fun as a one-on-one duel, as Wizard was, but OK if you put a pile of monsters on each side.

All things considered (size, price, scope), a perfect game. Combined with Wizard, this would be an 11. Reasonably realistic yet simple, easy to get into but impossible to put away, it's still a quality game worth playing three decades later. Melee, Wizard, The Fantasy Trip and GURPS probably consumed about 75 percent of the total game-playing time in my life.

Two or more gladiators decking it out with customizable stats and equipment? Sweetness. It lends itself to solo play? Double sweetness.

RATING: 7
Short and punchy game that tackles fight with primitive weapons -the system itself is quite crisp, but the wide range of approaches to fight means the rules are relatively profuse, especially considering that one fight seldom allows more than two successful attacks, and being written in the usual tangled up Metagaming style they take some time to digest (at least it's not their worst rulebook). Therefore, they can only be fully appreciated after several plays.

Fortunately, once the learning curve is over Melee can be enjoyed in several formats (players with single fighters or groups, against monsters thrown by a gamemaster for gathering experience points... anything that comes to mind, really), and its short duration comes in very handy.

Not as compelling as its twin sibling, Wizard, Melee nonetheless provides a very customizable system for creating -- well, they're not quite "characters," and this isn't quite an RPG, but they're fun to hustle around and bap each other with.

The fantasy roll-playing & wargame & miniatures game.  Better than Heroclix with more variety and greater control, but with some added complexity.  More wargamerish. The whole Fantasy Trip universe supplements all RPGs nicely.

RATING: 9
A wonderful game, especially with Wizard.  Small rule set does a surprising good job of capturing the feel of fantasy combat.  Note that there are significant rule changes between additions, I would recommend the later ones which are a bit more polished.

MICRO GAME CLASSIC
Another blast from the past.  Slotted somewhere in between D&D and miniatures and was dirt cheap.  A good little game when you just wanted to some combat without the foreplay.  Better when paired with Wizard.

RATING: 8
A single one-vs-one fight is not that interesting with this system.  It isn't detailed enough to allow significant tactics in that situation.  But the simplicity of the game makes it very playable in the context of a 4-vs-4 battle or something larger.  Of course, what really made this game great are the companion products -- Wizard and the various choose-your-own-adventure supplements.

Had much fun playing this in the 70s and 80s. A much better combat system than D&D (whose armor classes never made sense to me. A good friend and I teamed it with the SL boards and turned it into a home made questing game--quite fun.

I have not played, nor enjoyed, much in the RPG realm.  The exception is Melee.  This tidy system has just the right level of complexity for my tastes and is the only game I've ever owned for which I've purchased and painted miniatures to enhance the playing of it.

I discovered this game and wizard after playing D & D for years. Did not take me long to realize how much better this was than D & D. I use to translate D & D modules over to this system for play. I have not played this in many years but still own it and would get right back into this if role playing was still my thing.

When I was going over BGG I stumbled over this entry and realized that I HAVE this game (polish version). It is still somewhere at my parents place (must find it!). I have to admit that I usually played it on my own but still had a nice time.

I liked to try it again now (after 10 years or so) but I'm afraid that it will not shine any more.

Rediscover this old classic [i]boardgame[/i] (better than RPG version IMHO).  In some ways this is the pure anti-Eurogame -- it has direct attack the leader, player elimination, cheap paper bits, and lots of dice. Yet it is still fun to play as a series of 5-10 minute one-on-one duels (where the loser can design a character to defeat the victor and repeat). Even better is a melee-a-thon free for all between many players.

This game launched me into fantasy role playing. The Fantasy Trip is the only FRP system I've ever really gotten into. I still think this is a great tactical system and It would be nice to see it re-released with awesome maps and pieces.

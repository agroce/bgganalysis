One of the only dice game I will probably continue to play.  The max players we have had in 1 game has been 6.  This is a great game for our boys (who doesn't want to race cars).  For beginners the basic race is ok, but if you are comfortable playing this game I would highly recommend you switch to the advanced rules.

RATING: 8
I enjoyed the game a lot for what it is, a game of rolling the dice and moving your car. It is more than that though as you must decide what gear to use and the best path for your car to take.  But it is mostly the luck of the die roll and I prefer strategy games. Still, I did enjoy the game and would recommend it if you are looking for this type of game. Components are very good, rules are easy to understand and there are two version of the game, basic (which we played) and an advanced version that appears to add a lot more to the game. we will try the advanced version the next time we play.

Dicefest, but a pretty fun one.  It can be hilarious when someone crashes and burns horrifically, or when the game becomes a demolition derby because the pack stays so tight.

fun racing game, actually feels fast paced, unlike some other race games I've played. Maybe runs a bit long for what it is, but, for me, most racing games do.

RATING: 7.5
My only gripe with Formula D (and Formula De, as well) is that the number of laps to race is so completely unrealistic as to ruin the idea for me. Real racing is a longer event, certainly. The game is enjoyable... I just wish there was a solution to the lap issue.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Love this game. Yes it depends on dice but you have to choose which one to use as they each represent a gear- six in total.  So you need to judge how you're going to take each corner. 
Up to ten people can play but that number can make the game drag. Five with two cars each works well. 
Quality board and equipment. A choice of Formula 1 or street racing.

A great new release of a classic race game. I like all the changes presented, especially the city racing aspect and the new drivers with special powers. Asmodee's graphical design and presentation changes are all wonderful as well.

This is a fantastic game, and I look forward to collecting all of the new tracks as they are released.

RATING: 5
I have mixed feelings about this one. On the one hand, it feels like a racing game and feels very thematic. On the other hand, it's an incredibly long roll & move game that was so excruciatingly long for such a heavy-luck game that we chose not to even complete three laps. We played the advanced game, which may have had something to do with our experience, but the character differences was actually one of the things all of us enjoyed. Some of the humor did feel downright racist and made our group a little uncomfortable, but we sort of gave it a pass on that due to the age of the game. Having just played Downforce the week before, which has a similar feel but a much faster playtime and more tension, I can't imagine why I would choose to play this one instead.

Slower than I wanted it to be, but that could be just 8+ players.  Probably better with fewer.  The gear shifting/card management mechanic is the coolest aspect.  Would like to play again.

This is just an example of theme and mechanics meshing together PERFECTLY. The dice-as-gears idea is spot-on, intelligent game-design. The game takes the long out-dated "Roll and move" mechanic and makes it work. Even after 20 years, this game still feels fresh and unusual. I have never failed to enjoy a game of Formula D. Multiple maps, variant rules etc make it endlessly repayable too.

RATING: 6
I was really surprised, how realistic the game felt despite the high level of abstraction and randomness with the die rolls. The key to success is in managing your speed through the corners and exiting with the highest gear possible. You can push your luck or play it safe, whatever suits your level of desperation.

There are two big problems though. The game is not provided with player aids of any kind, and checking the rules booklet for all the results for die rolls is just exhausting. Furthermore, the game plays waay to slow for a fast paced racing game. I do not think we played particularly slow but still it took more than an hour to finish one lap, and a single race is supposed to last for three laps. I reckon the lack of player aids is a major factor here.

I like racing games and Formula D would be an outstanding one if it was more player friendly and played faster.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fun as long as it doesn't go on too long.  With a large numbe rof players, one lap is enough, and on the map i played, it's not easy to overtake clustered cars once you get behind, but I do like it.  I think I may prefer cycle racing games, but I like the gear and bend mechanisms in this.

This one surprised me when my wife said that she enjoyed playing it and then requested to play it again. I think the simple design of just roll and move with little decisions on which die to roll and which lane to be in, it won her over.

RATING: N/A
Played this for the first time at the monthly board game group I run at the library.  My husband was off to a quick start, but he later fell back.

We missed part of the rules (the person who brought the game hadn't played it in years) so I would have died in a fiery crash early on in the game (that drive would have also gone out - as we rolled a 19 and 20 respectively on our crashes!)  

As it was, I ended up racing to the end.  (If I, and the guy I crashed into, has been out of the game, then my other friend would have won - so it was all good.)

It is an interesting game, and one I could see playing again, but the theme is something that doesn't really interest me, so I don't think I'll be owning it.

Just got this, having never played Formula De.  Lotsa fun and it captures the spirit of racing with this constant sense to push, push, push your luck to either hold your lead or to catch up.  I understand some people get burned out on the luck factor, but I think you just have to appreciate that as part of what makes this game fun.  

This new edition also has some nice improvements -- I really like the little "dashboards" for each car (instead of paper book-keeping).  The rulebooks look great until you actually read them;  they are probly the worst written rulebooks I've ever seen.  For such a fairly simple game, that's just wrong....

RATING: 6
This is a racing game where winning is about managing probability. Your cars can shift up a gear which is signified by going from one die to the next highest denomination. So, say a D4 to a D6 (dice go up to 30) or shifting down up to two gears. Your decisions largely are based on your position in the race, how many laps you have left, and what turns are coming up as you don't want to over shoot them. The game can be played on basic mode with one lap or more advanced with different tracks multiple laps and more special things but the problem is that the game starts to overstay its welcome if you play too long so you are stuck playing the longer more complex endurance based version and hoping the diminishing returns on fun are not too severe or playing the basic limited version and walking away feeling like maybe there wasn't enough game there. Formula D is still one of the best racing games I have played so far and it isn't like many others in my collection. I just rarely get it to the table because of its limitations.

"Love the idea, love the gear mechanic, love the damage system (tyre, engine points etc.), looks quite luck based as you can often miss a corner or just land safely with a very small margin of error and some people roll really well, but with the right focus it is possible to play well and you need to be quite aggresive but not stupid. 

The problem is it takes forever to play, usually the standings don't change much from the start so to really get the most out of it you need to play a series but I don't have that much time to devote to watching other people roll dice.

Also there isn't an awful lot of interaction for some if they get out ahead or behind and you need probably at least 6 cars, 12 would probably be an ideal player count  to really lock up the corners and keep the game tight but how long would that take?!"

RATING: 7.5
5-5-12 - Initial play was with only 3, but we enjoyed the first lap so much that we decided to immediately play a 2 lap race, and we all really enjoyed it. I think this one will be a hit with almost everyone I play with, so definitely will be coming out more often now.

Several more plays, with anywhere from 3 to 6, and this is a fun game. I did bump my rating from 8.5 to 7.5, but not because I don't like it, I still do, I just think I had it a tad high initially. I feel that 3 laps is probably the best length to even out the bad rolls, but that many laps can take a while, so almost have to make this the main game if you're going to do that...

RATING: 5
+ Choosing when to press your luck and when to play it safe with the gears gives you some control; Advanced rules give you even more customization and control.
- But you're still at the mercy of the dice; Takes a bit long to set up and get going for a light game.


Why it's previously-owned:
The draw of this game is its simplicity.  The downfall of this game is its simplicity; we simply would always want to choose a competitive game that had a little more meat on its bones.
In one of my favorite trades ever, I swapped this for Lord of the Rings.  We don't really have a race game at the moment, but we'll pick it up if the right one comes along.

A silly party game where you essentially roll dice and move your car towards the finish line on the Monaco GP circuit.

Played 4 player game in basic mode - started off slow, then realized that you have to press your luck as much as possible by taking damage, just not too much of it. A solid, quick, fun, easy to understand game - definitely a keeper! Played another 4 player game with advanced rules on the Monaco side (night) without the special driver cards. Inside of taking one kind of damage, you have several different types to manage. Extremely fun! My criticism is that I wish the 5 colors for cars (4 of each color in different models) had numbers on them to more clearly differentiate  them from the same color. 2015 UPDATE: I remember this one being tons of fun, so the rating stays as is.

Only played with the basic rules so far, but it was a lot of fun and suspense as the players who were behind tried to push their cars through the turns in higher gears and taking wear points.  Can't wait to try out the advanced rules!

Update: Advance rules tested out and it was a blast!  Having different gear points in certain locations was much better than lumping them all together.  You can have cars with tires wearing thin, so you have to take it easy on the corners, or (in my case) car body was almost gone, so I had to avoid rubbing up against other cars for the rest of the game.  The special powers for the drivers were a great addition, and using them properly will determine the winner.

I LOVE playing Formula D.

The art and the components are awesome.  The gameplay is deep enough to satisfy my car-enthusiast friends, but easy enough to keep my interest.  It supports big groups of people, but it's still great when you have just a couple of people.  The length is perfect for the type of game that it is.

The only small blemish on an otherwise perfect (for me) game is that I often see a leader run away with a game.  Once someone gets a little bit ahead, you have to start taking bigger and bigger risks to catch them, which usually ends up with me blowing through a turn and exploding my car.

This game is totally fun to play. I love the gear shift constraints of the push your luck element in this game. Introduced this to my uncle who is a Nascar fan and not a board gamer in the least amount and he LOVED it. I also played with my parents who are not board gamers, but are Nascar fans and they really enjoyed it too.  

Only downside to this game is that it needs a minimum of four cars to be on the track for it to be exciting.

There is much more strategy in this roll and move racing game than I was expecting. I assumed it would be a fun game for the family that I didn't really enjoy all that much. However, there are a lot of push-your-luck decisions when trying to maximize movement while minimizing damage. It also doesn't hurt that the board looks really great. It isn't one of my absolute favorites, but I definitely enjoy it quite a bit.

Good game, especially with lots of players (5+). Two included tracks are good, but really need to investigate expansions for greater variety. Gear shifting mechanism (different dice for different gears) is genius, and the gearbox/damage dashboard implementation is awesome.

One complaint: the rules are not well organized - they explain things clearly, for the most part, but if you want to find answers to specific questions that arise, you basically have to read the rule book from front to back every time, because they don't make things easy to find.

Its hard to Vote, It seems like a decent enough game, likely a 5-7, making decisions on moving your piece and future planning for moves, but I just can't imagine joining anyone playing the game at a con, or voting to play if any other game is being offered, since I personally don't see it as a fun exercise, nor a theme that I enjoy. hence 2, won't ever play again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Really love this game, a nice combination of tactics and luck required to play, with a little bit of resource management thrown in i.e. how many tyres can I afford to expend going around this corner, or do I need to grind down two gears? Each vehicle has slightly different stats, and there are plenty of tracks to buy as expansions to vary things.

I love the game, probably because its just about the only game I'm quite good at, but it's not everyone's cup of tea. The races can be overlong for some, and with any more than six players you can end up waiting too long between your turns. 5-6 players and two laps is definitely the sweet spot in terms of game length and cars on track.

Another great game to break out with the family...enough randomness not to be to serious, plays ten people, easy enough rules to teach makes this a winner with extended family.  The games do tend to run long with increased players but it makes for more interesting decisions as you race.  Having people thinking and counting spaces before their turn helps to speed it up a little, but since the field changes so often it is not always possible.  Haven't played the street racing version or custom drivers but am looking forward to many more plays.

I don't understand the love the game gets. The only redeeming part of it is that you get to play it with good friends. The decisions are uninteresting. You figure the percentages and then it is luck after that. It is actually my least favorite racing game that I have played and I have played several. One decision each turn, do I change gear and then roll and you are at the mercy of the dice. No strategy, just rolling.

I probably like this game more than I should.  It is not as in depth of most of the games I really love (like Caylus and Tzolkin), but it is fun.  As long as you are able to play fast this game provides an exciting game every time.  If you get behind you have the option to push your luck, even if this results in you blowing up it adds to the fun story.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Fun racing game that finds it's wealth in two things- a simple "push your luck" mechanic and its modular nature. Even in the advanced game, it's all about the thrill of shifting into a high gear when you really shouldn't (the varied wear-point values DO give you a little more to think about). Although the game can get more advanced, it never loses that simple charm. And on that note, you can add or take away as much as you want to make your own game experience. Advanced rules, street racing rules, weather rules, car and tire customization- it's a fairly simple game, but there's a lot of replayability here.

I like the updates to it, I rate it slightly below its revered older version, but am glad to have them both in my possession. This plays just like the original, except in street racing, and is fun in both like the older version. The artwork is good if a little unimaginative, but that can always be fixed. If you like racing board gaming and thought you wanted the original and cannot find it, pick this up instead, you will not be sorry. The components alone make this one worth it for me, the new bits and bobs are delicious and well done, don't take the pictures, go see this thing in real life somewhere, preferably in front of you on the gaming table!

Having a game to fit a big party (8-10 people) is great :)

I like the mix of luck and strategy this game provides. The "luck factor" is mitigated by thinking ahead a good deal, so it just provides lots of excitement.
It's a very thematic game, and you can certinly feel the stress of trying to do a curve well, and want to speed on the straights... 
It has a really nice graphic design, and the gear dashboards are simply genius :D


Good 4 to 7 player game. 8 to 10 people make the board crowded (which is interesting nonetheless), and less people and the game is not that interesting.

Racing games aren't usually my favorite genre, but this one is an exception to that rule. I've only played the basic game so far, but it was a crazy fast ride. I like the challenge of gearing up in order to stay in the lead, while still maintaining control in order to avoid overshooting a turn. As long as you play fast and furious, without counting and recounting your moves it actually feels like a real auto race. I really need to try the advanced game in order to get the full effect, but we had enough fun that I can see us pulling this game out again soon. My only complaint is that it is very hard to get up into that top gear and roll that big blue die, because there aren't many open straights with no surrounding curves. Everyone wanted to do it, but we never got the chance. Although perhaps we're just being too cautious and need to push our cars to the limit.

Not a ton of decisions to make, but there are definitely some. Most of the decisions involve how far to push your luck when going into a small corner in a high gear.

I can't see myself ever feeling the urge to do a 3 lap race, but 1-2 lap races are good depending on player count. Overall, it's an enjoyable push your luck game that is pleasant to play, however it isn't overly noteworthy.

I like this game, a lot in fact, but it is very dependent on the people you are playing with. With analytical players, or players that do not enjoy randomness, this games crashes.

[b]Update[/b] - No need to conceal my dislike of this game: I’ve never felt like joining any Formula D/Dé games ever since. Thus, during my Fall 2015 rating revise I lowered my rating from 6 to 4: maybe 3 would be more suited but honestly it’s not such a bad game, if you like the genre.

RATING: 7
Likes:
1) Amazing components.  From the shifters, to the cool little cars, the game was just very well thought out and put together.
2) Love the way the game incorporates a push your luck element.  Brings so many intense moments.
3) Game offers tons of variety as there are a ton of ways to play the game, and all seem like they would feel very different.

Dislikes:
1) Downtime with lots of players can be a real killer.
2) Still kind of wondering how balanced the game is for players that start so far back?  Still need to look into this.
3) Game can take a LONG time to finish with many players. 

Notes:
Fun game that feels VERY different from anything else I have played

Played the street rules with the drivers.  This version is different enough from the other versions to warrant more plays.  Some interesting little rule additions made this a fun and challenging race.  I also liked the dash...it's not paper but one you can use again and again.

Only played the basic game so far. Fun game, very easy to teach, although the rule book could be a bit more in depth.
The box says 14+, but I'd say 6+ is accurate for the simple game, 8+ for the advanced game.
It's no Bolide, but Formula D does a good job of simulating real driving without relying on complex movement formulas. Crashing's fun.

I will start this by saying that I have not played the advance rules yet. Once I give those a shot I will update this.

Formula D was a fun racing game, and my first board game racing game. The rules are pretty straight forward and not a whole lot to chew on(again, I only played the beginner version). Basically every turn you decide what gear you are in and that determines the die you roll for the number of spaces you will be moving. Where you are on the board means different things could happen, such as if you end up next to another player or if you're going through a turn.

It sounds pretty simple but there is actually depth to be had here. Turns require a certain number of stops, otherwise you incur a damage penalty. Depending on how you take the turns will really determine where you end up in the race. Take it too conservatively and you end up behind everyone. Too fast and you end up with a lot of damage.

Set aside about an hour for this game.

The board has two sides: street and Formula 1. We played on the Formula 1 side. The game can be expanded beyond the base tracks with expansion tracks and tracks from the predecesor game: Formula De.

The beginner rules are pretty easy to follow. There are a lot of advanced rules, but I haven't quite sunk my teeth into them. I will say that they look interesting and should add some variety to the game.

Overall our group had a lot of fun with the same. It's also nice that it supports up to 10 people. I haven't tried it yet, but I think this would lend pretty well to solo play as one could easily control a couple of different cars.

Recieved this for Christmas and haven't played the new version yet. This rating is mostly for the old version and also because of the street course side, plastic gear trays and the variable player cards included with this version. The game is beautiful and components are very nice. Will update after I get a few plays in of this new version.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.1
Neat racing game with gears used to determine the size of dice you roll to tell you how fast you go. There's tyres, brakes, bodywork etc. that can depreciate if you mess your turns up - you have to end one or two turns within a certain area of the board and that limits your speed.

Formula D scores over Formula De in that it provides a street racing aspect as well as the F1 aspect, this means the purists will need to make more purchases to get hold of enough F1 circuits to run a season, but you could always compromise and run F1 "street" (Adelaide, Singapore, Monaco, need I go on...)

RATING: 5
Not a big fan of racing games although they do produce "fun" moments.  Game decisions boil down to: Change gear or not, roll die, Change lane or not, wait for my next turn.  Not enough meat here for me.  This one seems especially fiddly with lots of "special" rules situations.

I want to like this game much more than I do - I like the idea, the mechanic of the gear shift, and update to Formula De is cool - gear shift, street racing, different racers, nitro. All sounds really great ... but when I play it I realise how annoying it is, and street racing was worse than Formula De!. Basically you pick a gear (usually totally obvious) then roll the die ... not much to it at all. Winning or losing usually comes down to your opponent rolling low and stopping short of a critical corner, or you doing it instead. Also suffers from downtime and taking way way too long. I prefer the mini version.

If you race 1 lap, then being lower down the order you are doomed unless others really mess up. Play more laps to balance it and you've lost the whole afternoon, much rather play other racing games than this!

I got this game because it could play up to 10 people. While it does play 10 people, it loses a lot of appeal than if you played with 5-8 players (the sweet spot). 

The game offers some luck, some strategy, and some fun interaction with other players. It does a good job of balancing luck and skill to where most everyone could enjoy it. I personally find it a little shallow, but I won't complain if it can get all of my friends and family to play as well.

Formula D is a great racing game and really grabs you with its theme and how the mechanics really work within the theme.

This game is good fun to play, it would be better with the addition of beer, the cursing and shouting are great fun to partake in and listen to!

Update:  An awesome game for many people, the 'betting' on whether to stay in a high gear and risk danger or to drop a gear and make teh corner - or even to drop a gear and time a corner with a upward gear change makes for a great little game.  Love it!

I have bought the Asmodee edition - fantastic production values and I like the alternate rules.  I will probably mostly play with the old rules, but it is always fun to have an alternative, and the new cars are great too!

Simulation of motor racing, with choices in which die to roll and how to allocate movement. You should play with a time limit per turn (do not allow players to count spaces after they roll) and once you move your guy, that's it. No backsies on the road.

Seen on Tabletop and loved it from the explanation to the end.
"Shifting gears" and "different categories than can be damaged" were things that I missed in "Ausgebremst" and therefore I ordered it right away.
Great game which I truly love.

It might seem like just a roll-and-move-game, but with the gears and the given amount of stops you have to take in each corner it really is more than that.
Your tactic can fix bad dice rolls.

Uses dice, but do not believe that this means this is a game of chance! This will depend on the track you are racing on though. Some tracks reward courage, dare and luck. Avoid those (Nuerburgring, Portugal and Zandvoort come to mind).

Favorite tracks: Spa, Shanghai, Monza and Monterey.

RATING: 7
Fun, unique race game with an interesting theme and a lot of flavor. The gear shift/dice upgrade mechanic is truly original, and for being such a light game there really are some interesting choices to make on your turn. Usually exercising caution is your best option, but pressing your luck is a crucial component to doing well, and makes the game so much more fun. Sometimes it pays off to be in last place because you can afford to stay in a higher gear while those who shot ahead of the pack are stuck at a slower pace. Getting to the pit stops first can give you a crucial advantage, unless someone (crazily) decides to skip it and go for the win without it. 

It's not a great game for two players, and would probably be annoyingly chaotic and frustrating with more than six, but it's very fun nonetheless. Perfect for a small party, and would be perfect for non-gamers.

Declan was playing really well but got a little cocky and exploded his car on the last turn.

Played with basic rules, one lap, five players, and the game felt interminable. Adding more rules, nor laps, would not have made the game better, only longer.

It's been awhile since I played the original, so at this point I'm not exactly sure what the differences are. The shift (hah!) away from pad-and-paper for your character sheet makes sense... though I do miss the ability to name my dude.

It's still an enjoyable game, but I still think it runs a tad too long (when you're at higher player counts especially).

I like that the box is finally a reasonable size, also.

I have never really been a fan of racing so I wasn't a big fan of this game from the beginning. I played just one lap of the basic game and the game felt too slow for me. Just dice rolling and moving...kind of boring. The advanced game has more going on but I can't see myself enjoying the game even with that. Too repetitive and slow for my tastes, but I could be talked into on occasions.

Very fun. While occasionally declared "a stupid roll and move game" by some, the fact that the same few people keep coming out ahead shows that tactics and thinking play a good part. However occasionally you WILL get bombed by constistently bad rolls while somebody else just has a row of spot on rolls.

RATING: 7.5
I think that I like the newer updated version better than the original.  The "gearbox" feature is much more streamline, and certainly easier to remember which gear your car is in.  I also like that you won't run out of paper dashboards since everything is recorded with plastic pegs instead of paper.  Even the new box has a better footprint and fits in my closet better.

I also like the scalability of the rules.  You can play the simple rules to introduce the game - 18 "Wearpoints" that get deleted as you travel along the track.  Or, you can start with pre-designed wearpoints for tires, gearbox, breaks, and so forth.  Or, you can custom design your car.  You can also play with the weather, or ignore that part.  You can play one lap, or three, or as many as you want.  The flexibility and scaling of the rules to cater to the type of board-game player (from casual to hardcore) is what makes this game so enjoyable.

The one thing I don't like are the fixed colors of the cars.  You have to have the same color scheme for the game, rather than being able to mix and match your spoilers and car bodies to match your taste.

But other than that, the reprint is a superior product.

I just can't make up my mind on this one.  When I think about the game it seems like tremendous fun, but during play it seems to be repetitive and totally random.  If I can 'get it' I think it's on the verge of jumping up to a 7 or 8.  If not, well, it will probably stay put as a better themed version of Candy Land.

July 11 - Interesting game, I would play again but first play seems really bland and seems to be quite slow going.  Maybe it's because of the lack of direct interaction.

Along with Snow Tails, Formula D is one of my preferred racing games, and yet it's a game that does not get to the table too frequently. There's a key reason for this--Formula D is a very light game. It is a glorified "roll and move" game, but where players can "shift gears" by rolling bigger and better die. That doesn't interest the serious gamers that I hang with, but it is a game that I still feel deserves a slot in my collection for its accessibility and fun.

I like to think that increased family gaming will get this one to the table with greater frequency.

I really need to play this. Several solos. None with other people. I don't know that it is a keeper, except I have this dream that someday it will really jazz my kids.

Update: Finally had a first play against people. It was fun. We were three. I think four would be better. Five might be too much. As long as everyone keeps rolling and moving, the game is good. Counting spaces is bad. I'll never be a big roll and move kind of person, but I don't see trading this. It fills a role in the collection and will see occasional play.

2008 Secret Santa Gift! We played a one lap race using the basic rules. I thought it was really fun and was excited to use the advanced rules, but it didn't go over so well with everyone else. The gear shifting and dice rolling creates some real excitement and the temptation to push your car to the limit is always looming. I am determined to get this game out again.

This was a disappointment. I've long enjoyed Formula De Mini with my son as a 2p and up to 4p game. I thought the added complexity and various tracks would be rewarding. However, it feels like the extra moving parts detract from the fun of the race.

Played with 8 players was painful and WAAAY too slow. I think maybe as a 4p game there is a happy medium there. The game should have some play aids to remind people how they can lose points in various areas. 

The notion of a campaign game where people upgrade their cars is attractive, but in reality I don't want to be playing this game anywhere near that often. Overall, this is a game I respect more than I enjoy playing. I'll probably look to trade away my copy in the near future.

Lightweight yet strategically interesting because of the challenge of determining the right die (gear) to use as you approach those nasty curves.

Fun game!  My husband (who is not a gamer) enjoyed it as does my son.  We've only played the basic game so far but look forward to trying the more advanced rules.  Really enjoy the shifting and trying to figure out how many wear points you can afford to expend before we can make it to the pits.
Edit:  played 4p with my daughter who also enjoyed (she's 5 yrs. old).  Great fun to press your luck in higher gears - especially when someone's car blasts through a curve way too fast causing it to flip repeatedly and burst into a ball of flames.  Must use the white "minivan" car as an ambulance to go to the rescue!

RATING: 7.8
A fun game of roll-and-move with some interesting decisions to make in the corners.  Sadly, the game can get repetitive, and doesn't let you open up your speed (at least in the base tracks) as much as you want.  It's a great game that anyone can pick up and play with a ton of variability- and that's only made more-so by the tons of house rules and modifications out there to fit this game to your style of play. On top of Formula 1, you get the awesome street racing rules and board kick it up a little more as do the awesome components and stunning artwork!

It feels appropriate that I learned this game the same weekend that I did Mississippi Queen.  They have a lot in common.  The key difference in Formula D is the specific requirements to get around curves.  Do you risk blowing out your tires in order to keep your speed around the bend?

Great parts and great fun - but fair warning that luck plays a big factor here because your speed is set by rolling dice.

While drag racing isn't usually my thing, this game most definitely is.

A take it or leave it kind of game for me.  Fun to put on the table with non-gamers or during events with booze at them.  I will only play this as long as the house rule is in place stating that nobody can think about their move when it's their turn - they must immediately roll, move, and decide their next gear within a short period of time (often seconds).  This creates the right amount of pressure to make the game fun (and perhaps makes it a little more realistic).  Otherwise, it gets a little painful to sit through.

Components: Lots of great detail on the maps. The gear shifts and cards are cool. There's no clear way to keep track of how many times a player has stopped in a turn. It's difficult to move the tiny car along the tiny spaces without losing track of where we started.

Experience: I had heard a lot about this being so good with lots of players, but it ended up just being long and random. There's nothing to do when it's not my turn, waiting for other players to plot out the many permutations of their possible moves.

Players are randomly penalized at the beginning with an engine not starting. They are randomly penalized with not starting near the front of the pack. And then the dice compound the issue with a single die roll having a huge range that can overshoot a corner, or not quite even enter it.

Wanted to like this, but didn't, and neither did anyone else.

Dec '14 - Rated 6.

I bought this game because many reviewers commentated that most roll-and-move games suck except for this one. So I picked it up with a BGG Auction. After learning the rules, I never really had the desire to bring it out with my play group. Eventually I did, and they were 'meh' about it.

I think this game would work if we were more interested playing a campaign (series of races) and kept score. But my group is more of a one-and-done, so this didn't work for us. Also it got samey after one lap.

I was able to auction it away at my FLGS for store credit.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Plus several expansion boards.

This is one of the very rare games where I tend to bypass most of the more advanced rules, as a 1-lap race is perfect for me and the family members I play. I thankfully got into this in it original "Formula De" release, which allowed me to purchase 50 expansion tracks. But I love the new edition, as the dashboard components are much more fun to use than the pad of paper the original game used.

2011-02-25:7>8 I basically just think that the dice-as-gears mechanic is fantastic and makes the game brilliant on its own. Advanced rules don't really add enough to the game imo to merit their complexity unless you customise the cars. I could play this over and over as a lightweight game though. Excellent blend of strategy/luck for a family/casual game.

2011-02-10:5.9>7 since my previous rating/comments were mainly based on incorrect expectations, rather than the game failing to do what it sets out to do.
2009-04-29:I love the different dice being used for different gears. The combination of risk management and working out an optimal path given the required stops at corners, ability to jump down multiple gears but only go up one are both interesting.

However, the interaction felt minimal even when the pack was together and once the pack was separated, non-existent.

It really seems to come down to whether you'll have fun watching folk risk taking damage on the roll of a die. There's definitely excitement to be had, but I was hoping for more viable choices and actual interaction.

Cool reinvention, beautiful new graphics, no more pen and paper notes and wooden pawn but a cool gear stick and cards. The new street racing is different enough to think you get 2 games in one.

Random dice rolling racing game with a very small space for tactical maneuvering. Some push your luck elements with the dice and managing car wear.

Board is big and colorful, the miniatures are of mediocre quality but are painted.

A rather lengthy party game of rolling dice and waiting in between turns.

I was a little skeptical about this game at first. I had heard it was a lot of fun, but I'm not one for NASCAR or racing. However, pretty much every one I talked to about it said the same thing, "I'm not into racing or NASCAR, but I loved playing this game." So, I bought it and I'm impressed with how simple or complex the game can be. Plus being able to play with up to 10 people is a huge plus, since our game nights usually involve 6+ people. I'd recommend this game to anyone.

Played a local race with a large group and then had the good fortune to pick this up in a math trade. The game does have a lot of luck (dice rolling) but matches the chaos of real life F1. The action is fast and players really get into the game. Looking forward to pulling this out with larger groups when something light but fun is desired.

There is nothing quite like Formula D. I adore it. Who thought a roll and move game would be so fun. By far my favorite way to play is with the teams variant. Five players, each controlling two cars, going for the highest sum of points. As such the runaway leader problem is medicated.

The update is pretty. I do like the new player boards and the nitro boost is a nice touch. But I find the drivers just add another piece of randomness as well as something extra to track and thus detract from the game.

I didn't expect to rate it a 5.  The huge boards are cool (got the base and one expansion board) and the theme is good.  But this one just didn't click.  After multiple plays (both basic and advanced driver cards), I just don't see much in the game.  It feels like I'm going through the motions.  To possibly give it a bit of credit though, I never played with more than about 6 cars on the track.  Maybe more things would happen with a more crowded track.

Enjoyable racing car game - needs to be played at a brisk pace and with no counting out multiple possible moves with fingers or retracing moves to do something different - if you allow this sort of thing it will drag with more than 3-4 players.

Players should have 30 seconds after the previous player has gone to roll their dice - otherwise they stay in the gear they were in - and a move is a move, no redo's.

Really wanted to like this one. Thought my son would really dig it. Besides the gearing up and down with the dice, most of the other gages really didn't factor in much. The last game I played, my 10 year old son had a friend over and they were anxious to play. After the first lap, they wanted a rest break and they never came back to the gaming table. Traded this one off after that.

Wonderful game, I think it's genius how they simulate actual racing and shifting gears.  My only complaint is how long a lap takes.  I feel like this game isn't deep enough to warrant the many hours it takes to complete multiple laps.  Recently, I read someone's comment saying that this game is much better when you play it as a full grand prix.  One game then becomes a small part of a bigger competition.  I think this is a great idea and I think I'll have to try it out.

I like this one quite a lot. Being a Formula 1 fan probably helps, but my wife and kids also like this one. The winner has emerged from the last corner all three plays so far and despite the luck of the dice, you can see some consequences of your decisions.

A fun and well made racing game that takes into account so many real life factors in racing. Also, many times it can seem like someone is running away with it, but one wrong move or the last few turns can completely change the game and it's really tense sometimes. I dig it very much.

A literal roll and move game with a little more strategy.  You are in a race with 1-9 other people going around the track trying to win, but you have to stop a certain amount of times, down-shift, up-shift, etc as you hit curves.  This is not an easy game as you have 5 dice that have different numbers on them representing your speed.  However, there has yet to be a game where everyone did not feel the need for speed.  A great game if you love racing games and easily one of my wife's favorites.

The best roll and move game available (though, honestly what does that even say?). The cornering, gear shifting, and tire wear mechanisms make this game really fun and decently thematic. There is not much room for strategy, but a well timed press for luck can really mix things up. The strange part of this game is that without enough players the board is too open, but with too many the game takes an eternity, and that equilibrium point is hard to lock down. But, if you are looking for a game to play while shooting the breeze, this a good fit. Find a track with a load of corners and let the dice roll. Hopefully, someone will explode.

I also enjoy the older edition of this game; this version represents an upgrade in components, with additional street racing rules. The street racing can be pretty crazy, and are a nice diversion from the formula one game. Kudos to Asmodee for maintaining backwards compatibility with all 35 previously published tracks from the older edition! The dashboards in this edition of the game rock, though, and the addition of street racing is a bonus.

I've only been able to play this once since I got it almost a year ago. It seems intriguing and I originally got it because it has a high player cap, but now I think that it would probably play better with a smaller group anyway. I know it is a great game, but it just seems a bit overwhelming. It has a full set of "beginner rules" and "advanced rules" but even the beginner rules just don't seem intuitive enough for me to be confident in explaining them without reading out the rulebook.  That could change with some more play experience, but i'm just not that interested in bringing it out when I have so many other games i'd rather play.

Well, this game helped me realize that I'm not a huge fan of racing games:). This is a roll and move game and while the advanced variants make this more entertaining and offer a push your luck element, the game lacks depth, strategy, and all in all left me looking forward to the end of the game.  Additionally, because the game is so based on luck, there is a significant chance of somebody getting a runaway lead.  Which can make the rest of the race seem drab.

Interesting concept, but fairly slow gameplay which is ironic considering that it is a racing game. Formula D is a long enough game that the 4-5 times I have played we have never decided to race more than one lap. I wish the gameplay was faster because this game would get more plays. It is a lot of fun, but if I am going to spend 1.5 hours or more I am probably going to play something else.

After playing the advanced game, we more or less unanimously decided that we'd stick to just the basic rules from now on. Having to juggle tires/gears/brakes isn't all that difficult, but it forces you to think a bit harder about what gear you want to be in and where you want to end up. And using the basic rules instead of the advanced ones allows us to perform crazy actions and be much more aggressive with our rolls.

Formula D shines when everyone isn't spending time thinking about optimal playing and just goes for it. We house-rule that as soon as you roll the die you must move your car, and you're not allowed to count out the spaces ahead of time (unless you do it in your head). This really keeps the pace fast and seems to give our group the most amount of fun.

This is probably one of, if not the best racing board game out there.  There are lots of them these days, and many use similar mechanics, but Formula D is the most fun.  The new version here that supports both Formula 1 and Street racing went a long way to bringing the classic game to a new audience.  The basic rules are simple enough for even young children to learn and enjoy while the Advanced Rules really bring the game to life with added customization and various special rules to really put a lot of strategy into the game.  It's only real fault is the rather randomness of a "roll to move" game, but the special dice for the game mitigate that to some extent by having minimum numbers on the various dice.

A roll and move game for games and families alike.  Everyone I've played Formula D with have gotten very invested in the game.  The core game is very easy and intuitive to pick up.

There are basic and advanced rules for both traditional F1 style racing and street racing along with a double-sided board giving 2 race tracks in total.

The only drawback is particularly when dealing with the advanced rules is the wording is ambiguous regarding the elimination of cars.

There is a lot of potential mileage in this game... ;-D

Its a great thing to see this classic game updated and re-released. Long live the production of new tracks. I like the new street racing element and racer powers. I also like the fact that you can choose not to use any of these new rules for the original experience. The new presentation is nice too.

This is one of my favorite games. I love the use of the different size dice for different gears - an inspired idea - and the game is simple enough to move fast. I enjoy both the basic and advanced games, the first is just flatout fun, while the later is more strategic. Highly recommended.

I work for General Motors so a game about racing always goes well with folks from work.  I've had several successful plays of this with groups of 8-10.  Only recommendation I would have for the game is adding some sort of marker for every player to show if they have taken their turn this round yet or not (gets confusing with lots of players).  Red/Green two sided chip perhaps???  I've tricked my game out with a red/green background card set with the images of the different formula racers.

First game with new Formula D edition, disappointing, colours from the car didn't match all the cars on the cards, the new gearbox is a nice idea but poorly conceived, how should we count the stops inside a corner... by running 6 more cars on the track... Is going now from my Wishlist "Must have" down to a love... 

If you had the possibility to get the original cheap "Formula De" than take it, it's an eight or higher, but this one...

My rating is a response of throwing away the chance to make a very good game (Formula De) to a better, state of the Art game for the fans. Poor Asmodee.

Had fun blowing my car up during our first run of the beginner rules. Our second race we jumped to the advanced rules and I drove near perfectly, and ended up getting well ahead of the pack. The game plays strongly with its theme, but we feel this would be more fun if it had some Mario Kart antics to give those that lag behind early some chances to catch back up with things like Spikey Turtle Shells, Mushroom Boosters, Lightning Shrink Rays, Star Power, ect.

Solid overall, would like to play it again with the maximum amount of players.

This is a nice little game and the gear mechanic is nice, higher gear= bigger dice, however I always find the game goes on far too long and after about 5 turns there is a player or players so far in the lead that the rest of the pack have no way to catch up.

There is also always one player who isn’t interested in winning the race just crashing into other cars and causing damage.

RATING: 7
Remember playing Chutes and Ladders as a kid?  And remember waking up and realizing one day that who wins that game is dependent 100% on the dice rolls and 0% on anything you do?  Formula D took that feeling of futility and got rid of it.  You still roll dice to get around a board, but you can shift up gears and roll larger numbered dice.  Enter a turn rolling too large a number, though, and you'll crash, so you might want to shift down.

I found the game quite enjoyable, but I also noticed near the end that people were running off to grab a snack or checking their phones when it wasn't their turn for the last third of the track, so some people were clearly getting bored.  It doesn't help that turn order is determined by car order on the track, meaning that you don't get to take turns in a nice clockwise pattern.

Ignore my rating, that is just me trying to be honest to how "good a game" this is.

I honestly love the dice rolling, the push your luck, and the little gearbox you get.

Unfortunately, some rules are a little counter-intuitive, and the game is a little on the complicated side considering how much depth is actually there.

Dice don't like me for some reason. In turn, I don't much like them, either. However, the gear shifting and the additional feature points available in Formula Dé give the players just enough influence over their cars that they can actually feel in control even though they're still just throwing dice in the end. Malicious dice can still kill you here, but it's always a bit your fault, too. Why did you have to go through that corner in 6th gear in the first place?

The changes they made to Formula Dé are pretty good for the most part. The new dashboards are certainly a big win over pen and paper in the old edition.

The French know Formula One racing.   And at this point Formula De (now Formula D) is a classic. With its beautiful double sided, double width racing circuit boards, cleaver multi-gear dice rolling mechanic and resource management work together to mitigate the dice luck factor and will have you tense between turns as you figure out the best gear and path though the pack to each corner of the track to become the first place Champion!

Pros:
- easy to learn and to teach.
- very thematic
- the board and the cars look very nice. I don't have the new version with an actual gear box and nice set of dice, but those look great too.
- feels quite intense, cars do go fast.
- the mechanics work well, with the different gears, having to reduce your speed in the turns and look for the perfect curve.
- does not feel old (even though it is!)

Cons:
- no handicap to help newbies or players lagging behind
- relies a lot on luck

A solid racing game which is surprisingly fun given how simplistic the mechanics seem at first. I put off buying Formula Dé until it went out of print.

I was prepared to hate this, given my general dislike of games which use dice for determining the outcomes of player actions.  But it's a decent game.  One has quite a bit of control over the outcome, and the dice rolling has an infectious press-your-luck feel to it.

One of my most personally-hyped games. We still haven't moved on to the advanced rules, but everyone enjoys shooting around the track and trying to find that sweet spot between playing smart and playing aggressive.

It loses some love because of the end of the game. It probably plays about 10-15 minutes too long, and everyone usually knows who's going to win 20-30 minutes before the game actually ends.

This is an absolute blast with the right group, but some players might be dismissive of the game's theme and detract from the enjoyment. The perfect group for me would be lots of open-minded players who have some interest in racing and can appreciate the mechanics of the game.

A great game to play when you have more than five players, and playing in teams adds some interesting strategy. The game manages to capture the strategy and feel of circuit racing surprisingly well.

Unfortunately a few of the rules in the game are unnecessary and make the game too random. Strip some of the
 more random rules away, and the underlying system is very 
solid. Playing with more than one lap makes the damage
 system much more meaningful, but adds a lot of playtime. Unfortunately experience with the game doesn't seem to cut back on playtime.

The two tracks included in the box are a lot of fun, but the special rules for the street race are a bit too random. Play it as an alternative to the formula race, and it's a lot of fun. This game is begging for extra tracks if you're feeling creative or willing to shell out the money for the pricey expansions.

Only a board game could make racing seem slow, and I've only played with a few players so there wasn't much downtime. Still, it scratches the roll-and-move itch better than almost any other game.

I like the idea of the game: simple dice racing with fancy dice and some tactics, but I don't like player elimination. It's nice to have high stakes and most things can be mitigated, but when someone else collides with you and you roll two 1s in a row on a d20, that sucks. 

It's also a bit on the long side and of course random. It's also not fun to be in last because you'll have to play through even though you'll probably lose.

I'm happy that I upgraded from Formula De. The snazzy dashboards and the better-looking cars really add to the enjoyment. I also like that they've added two new modes of play.

The "rules for beginners" are similar to the rules from Formula De Mini, with universal wear points that are not broken down into tires, brakes, engine, etc. They're good for casual play, although I think 18 points is way too many for one lap. Something like 12 is probably better.

The "rules for advanced players" are practically the same as the old Formula De advanced rules. The biggest difference I noticed is that the car damage does not vary by race length. All the cars are 6/3/3/3/3/2 or alternatively 20 points assigned as you like. In the old Formula De, one-lap cars were 4/3/2/2/2, two-lap cars were 6/4/3/3/3 (no road handling for 1 or 2 laps), and three-lap cars were 20 points freely assigned.

The street racing rules are new in this edition. They add a once-per-lap nitro boost, individual drivers with special abilities, and street courses featuring special hazards. You can also mix it up and use street racing rules on the Formula tracks, or Formula racing rules on the street courses.

My main criticism is that they missed a chance to clean up some of the rules ambiguities, and instead have managed to introduce new ones. The ever-ambiguous rules for pit stops are even cloudier than before, failing to properly explain how a "quick stop" works. [i]Clarification: You take the extra movement on the same turn that you pit, and then can go to 5th gear the next turn if you wish.[/i] It's still not clear whether you can slipstream in the corners, or only on the straights. [i]I think it's allowed in the corners, as long as there is an arrow that allows you to overtake.[/i] The rules for overshooting corners are ambiguous where they used to be clear. [i]Clarification: You are allowed to follow the final arrow into a different lane, but then must continue straight ahead in that lane. Also, these lane change restrictions only apply when overshooting a corner, not when leaving it in the normal fashion.[/i] Are you allowed to weave back and forth around road hazards? [i]I think you are.[/i] If it's raining, do you you slide the extra spaces even when you are leaving the corner? [i]The rules imply that you do, but does "at least one space included in your move lie within the limits of a corner" if you began from the last space of the corner? Personally, I think the rule is worded incorrectly, and the sliding is only intended for the 1 or 2 or 3 required corner stops, not the moves used to exit the corner.[/i]

Fun game for adults and kids, with real strategy and decision-making. Rules can be simple, and the tracks are interesting enough to keep most people's attention.  On the downside, it can take a long time, and if one player gets too far ahead or behind, there isn't much besides reckless driving that can bring things back to parity. Nice looking game too!

This game accomplishes a unique feat: it creates an exhilarating sense of speed and a reckless regard for your own personal safety. And it does so with gorgeous cardboard maps and tiny plastic cars.
Incredible.
You roll different sized dice based on what gear your car is in at the time. Rolling that die determines how far your car moves around the track. Roll a four sided die for first gear. Roll a big, fat 10 sided die for sixth. Take a sharp turn too fast, and you'll smack the wall, reducing your driver and his car to a greasy stain, and leaving you with a big goofy grin on your face. Pacing is key. Trying to stay calm and make the right choices is still the best strategy, just like real racing, but you'll constantly strain against the desire to just floor it, and see what happens. 
Because people do.
And sure enough, the fun part comes when a ballsy newbie takes that last "S-type" turn in 4th, blows past you, and crosses the finish line dragging their transmission behind them in a shower of sparks and white smoke. You can almost  see the oily residue on your windscreen, as you pound the steering wheel in rage.
That's what a game is supposed to do, boys and girls. Create an experience. 
Formula D.

This could replace RoboRally in my collection simply because of how much hatred that game has received. Much more intuitive high numbers capacity game that plays quickly and easily. Haven't tried with 5+ so I don't yet know how it will work in these situations (which is precisely why it is in my collection right now, to handle a larger group that might include non-gamers).

In the end, the game just plays too slowly. This is unfortunate given that it is a game about Formula car racing.

RATING: 7
This is a pretty basic roll and move racing game and there aren’t many decisions during the game to talk about, well at least not hard decisions once you learn the tricks. The thing is that I like it pretty good if you take it for what it is; a light racing game. It’s thrilling to play and you can definitely socialize during the game.

I think generally that the game is too long for what it is and therefore we usually only play one lap with it. There is more skill and risk management involved in two lap races, but the game is getting monotonously after a while.

This is also a game that needs a lot of people playing it for it to really work.

The first impression was great, but something gnawed at me me through repeated plays, something I couldn't quite put my finger on. 

Finally I realized what it was: with fewer players, it became necessary to double up on cars in order to make the car-to-car interactions interesting. This slowed down a quick game designed to be mechanically and thematically fleet. With more players, downtime became an issue, and ditto. No matter what you did to the game, it comes down to someone rolling a die and then saying 1...2...3...4...5... It's just never as quick as it needs to be. 

Traded for PitchCar and haven't looked back.

A very fun racing game.  Between the basic game, advanced game, and street racing there are lots of variable "games" in the box.  A basic game that I could almost play with my 5-year-old, simple dice rolling and managing speed to turn corners.  The advanced game adds in lots of interesting dynamics and allows you to try and push your speed through certain corners to attempt to get ahead, but balancing those risks is essential.  The street racing game makes every car different and so different players will try very different strategies.  Any individual game is only a 7, but since I can play any of them, it gets a .5 addition.

THE racing game.  Components are well improved over the original.  You'll really appreciate the new plastic gear boxes.  The addition of street racing is great icing on the cake and gives you another option for play.  What a great way to add some flavor.  Thanks Asmodee!  Love it!

After further play, I'm finding some options really help the game.

1. No counting before moving your car.  Pick up and move! No take backs!  You have all the other player turns to decide on the gear die you want, and determine the range you need.  

2.  I think a timer would help to prevent the candyland style pre-counting that just kills the game for me.

3.  Use basic rules + the street race options for best game.  Advanced rules don't seem to offer much to improve play and instead just bog play down.  This game needs to keep pace to keep it's flavor.  Also advanced rules don't have cars rubbing each other nearly as often.  :)

My only problem with this game is I don't know how many players this is meant for.  If you play with 3-4 players, the board is too empty and there is not enough interaction between the cars on the road.  If you play with 8+ players, you get the interaction but the game is going to take way too long.  I love the idea of this game, but in practice, there are so few situations when I actually want to bring it out.

Simple mechanics, but I really like this game.  A real racing feel with push your luck dice rolling.  Best when you can play multiple tracks with a league so when you are completely left out of a race it tempers the disappointment knowing you get to come back next week.  Simple, fun and appeals to non-gamers.  Adding pegboards to keep track of stats to replace paper and pencil in this relaunch is genius.  Also adds street racing for the types who like that sort of thing.

I love the huge range of complexity available. The simplest version I can play with my young nephews. The basic advanced version is good for introducing to adults, and from there you can add in weather conditions, characters with different specialties & the street racing maps & rules.

same game as Formula De with nicer components (no more pen and paper) and a new roadrace set of rules for variety.

12 1971 Le Mans cars (1/220) from Micro Racing Cars (http://www.microracingcars.com/en/)

D Tracks:

Sebring
Best qualifying lap:  4:53.85, 19 dice, 2 overshoot (25)

Chicago

Monaco
classic original track, always a good choice.
Best qualifying lap:  6:30.13, 18 dice, 2 overshoot (26)

Road Race
ok, not excited about roadrace rules.

Hockenheim Ring
like the track, didn't see an opening for the 30-sider, but still interesting choices to make.
Best qualifying lap:  4:11.76, 15 dice, 4 overshoot (23)
(tie) 3:33.43, 19 dice, 1 overshoot (23)

Valencia
Best qualifying lap:  4:44.64, 15 dice, 5 overshoot (24)
fun track, good decisions are there in some tight turns

Austin
Best qualifying lap:  3:47.03, 16 dice, 1 overshoot (20)
IMHO, not a great track.  Only one place to push-your-luck (6th gear between turn 5 and 6) and this has pretty high odds of failure.  Just not enough interesting gear decisions.  Several turns are actually so long that they are nearly impossible to overshoot.

Nevada Ride

Sotchi
Qualifying (Dan):  3:28.38, 17 dice, 1 overshoot (21)
Qualifying (Chad):  3.26.74, 21 dice, 2 overshoot (26)

New Jersey
Qualifying (Dan):  3:54.89, 22 dice, 2 overshoot (27)
Qualifying (Chad):  4:02.53, 23 dice, 1 overshoot (28)

De Tracks:

Spa-Francorchamps
favorite track - the chicane!

Zandvoort 2
fast track to play with a lot of 6th gear, but not the most tactically interesting.

Monterrey
tough track - lots of critical 4th gear rolls.

Magny-Cours, France
good track, lots of critical 5th/6th gear rolls

Monza
awesome track, many risky choices to make

Portland - good track

Elkhart Lake - tough track, many high speed sections with small 1-turn corners.

Indianapolis

Buenos Aires

Barcelona

Ray (tras años de insistencia de Yera)

Nueva edicion del clasico de 1991

El juego es basicamente el mismo de siempre, con algunos cambios:

- adicion de carreras "street racing" con personajes,   habilidades propias y circuitos especiales con algunas normas especificas. (aunque se puede jugar con los coches formula en los circuitos street y con los coches y personajes street en los circuitos formula). 

- nuevos paneles para la gestion de los puntos de daño del coche y la marcha engranada que sustituyen a los paneles de lapiz y papel del original. 

- nuevos coches, sin alerones intercambiables, mas vistosos que los del juego original. 

por lo demas es el mismo juego, con las mismas normas (aunque con un manual mas moderno y vistoso) y con las mismas virtudes y defectos. 

el nuevo modo street racing... no voy a decir que este mal, pero a mi no me convence. quiero decir... hubiera estado bien este tema de los coches "tuning" digooo "street racing" con sus habilidades, circuitos y normas propias... en OTRO juego del "mismo engine", pero para lo que era originalmente un juego de carreras formula a mi no me termina de hacer este... giro a lo "2 fast 2 furious". particularmente, yo me quedo con el juego original con coches formula, y lo que esta edicion añade al juego original... en mi opinion no necesitabamos comprar un juego nuevo para agregarlo (aunque no discutire que por el precio, ha salido bastante a cuenta). 

en fin. puesta al dia del clasico, con algunos cambios, pero manteniendo la esencia del original. sigue siendo un gran juego.

Race games are one of my favorite types and this one is the king. I really like the gearshifting in this game. It has a really good mix of strategy and chance for my taste. Plenty of player interaction, ability to accommodate lots of players, and rules that scale from easy enough for children to complex enough for high strategists make this one a winner. The mechanics have been very influential on later racing games (though it owes some debt to its predecessors as well). 

This edition of the game is so much better than the original Formula De as well. Instead of using pencils and paper, you get some very groovy looking player boards with gearshifts and screws that function to keep track of everything. The graphic design is sleeker, the cars are plentiful, distinct, and prepainted, and the alternate "Street Racing" rules are very fun as well. I'm happy to play this with either rule set depending on the group. This is exactly the kind of reprint this game deserved.

While racing games with modular boards do allow for more variety than this game offers, each pre-made track is its own challenge and allows players to improve on their play as they get to know each track better. It's not my preference for it to be this way, but I do enjoy it for what it is.

I realize that for racing games, I already have Snow Tails and NASCAR Champions, both of which provide more strategy and tension with a lower game time.  Snow Tails in particular, I love the steering and speed mechanisms, and the ability to build your own tracks.  Formula D is limited in this respect, requiring you to buy numerous expansion boards for experiences that are more or less the same.  You can play a lap for an hour, and at that point, you pretty much know who is going to win.

Considering too that a friend in my group owns a copy, I don't feel strongly that I need a copy of my own anymore.  I received many plays out of it, but it has been untouched for a few years now.

RATING: 10
This is one of the best games I have found!  It can be a high spirited race, the dymamics are simple enough (and luck is prevelant enough) for family members down to 6 years old.  The rally rules allow deeper play, and a variety of tracks allows replaybility.  

The theme is very well represented with crashes, passes, and blown engines all contributing to the play.  There are add-0n cars you can use to paint and customize, and the advanced rules of building cars gives a depth that is rare in racing theme games. 

I like the addition of the "Street Race" rules and premade theme cars.

The down side is that some players can slow the game dramatically if they can't plan their move until they have the dice.  Also, bad play (or bad luck) is rewarded with early elimination.  Older track expansions are difficult to find and expensive.

“I’m dropping the hammer.” - Cole Trickle

GAMEPLAY
Players take turns rolling a dice to move their cars around the track pushing their luck to take the turns as quickly as possible. Cars must slow for the turns as they “stop” in them a number of times depending how tight and twisting it is. If cars overshoot or stop next to other cars they take damage. Take too much damage and the car crashes. I recommend playing with the basic rules unless all of the players have had a chance to play. The small finagling when using the advanced rules for drafting, weather, and multiple categories for car damage can slow the game down greatly.
COMPONENTS
The game board is so big it come in two pieces. You need a large board and the folded sections will need some use to get them flat but its not a big problem. The molded components are all simple and nicely crafted. The car models come in two sets of five color combinations which is too bad but some simple model paint can correct that if you require.
THEME
The gear mechanic is a prefect match for the game as players push their cars to the limit. Damage points are slowly and sometimes not so slowly chipped away as cars rub bodies and rev engines to the limit.
WHO IS IT FOR?
If play with 2 to 4 players consider racing two cars each. The rules are simple but the game can bog down with too much chatter. To keep younger players involved keep the race short at a single lap. Ages 6 and up can enjoy the basic version of the game with strong guidance from an adult. One lap five player 45 minutes to an hour.

It is amazing to me that so many people think this is just a random dice fest.  This is a push your luck game where your ability to take calculated risks pays off strongly.  If you are in the lead you play cautiously, no point in risking losing it on a corner when you are winning. If you are the back marker you will take a 25% chance of being wiped out if it might move you up a few places past drivers who have something to lose!

Probably the most in-depth board- and token-based game I know of for 10 players, Formula D is an inspired take on motor racing in tabletop format. It's one of those games you can imagine taking very seriously and developing leagues and buying extra tracks.

The only downside to Formula D is that unlucky players do get knocked out due to vehicle damage and it's quite a long game if you have to sit out the result. It's hard to know how to mitigate that.

Have enjoyed the original Formaua De for many years and have all of the tracks. The basic rules aren't worth bothering with. The advanced rules are almost identical to the original rules. Street racer option is a nice addition. Cars are small, but no smaller than the diecast cars for the original. Well worth having for the dashboards instead of pencil & paper.

I HATE watching race-car driving of any kind. But I enjoy this game even though I tend to not like dice-rolling games. There's still enough strategy with timing your gear shift choices going into/out of corners and with taking damage to make it entertaining. Better with 4-6 players, if everyone can take quick turns but can be a bit long if you do the full 2 laps. 

Ultimately not a go-to game for us for most game days but is different enough from our usual fare that it breaks things up when we do bust it out to play. Good enough that I continue to pick up new race circuit boards for it now and then.

For a game so heavily depending on the roll of a die, this game offers a surprising amount of tactical decisions to be made. We work with the house-rule that you are never allowed to backtrack your car once you are moving it forward, also when it is your turn you have to play swiftly. This both speeds up the game and makes it a bit more realistic and fun.

Racing games are a genre I usually avoid, but I finally got a chance to try this landmark game in the genre and I found that I liked it better than its imitators.  It's fairly simple -- the only thing that's difficult to pick up is the different parts of the car.  This leaves players free to focus on the decisions of shifting up or down, with full knowledge of the implications of their decisions.  Also, it's fairly short, which I appreciated.  (1 play)

Although not entirely "realistic", it does capture the spirit of auto racing and is a lot of fun when played with a group who likes to move around little cars, pretending to drive really fast. There's plenty of flexibility in the rules to custom make the sort of game you feel like, and just the right mix of luck and skill for the sort of game it tries to be. A nice choice to have around, especially since not too many other games support up to ten players.

A solid racing game where you roll different sized dice depending on the gear your car is in.  Decisions generally revolve around when to change gears so you can slow down for the curves and speed up through the straightaways.  Fun with large groups (e.g. 7-10 cars in play).

I liked this a lot before, but I'm feeling like it may suffer in comparison to Thunder Alley. It wins hands down for component quality, but I don't know if that's enough to make me want to keep it around with Thunder Alley filling a very similar niche.

I'll be looking to get a few games in some time soon to see how it holds up.

This has come out about three or four times, and was best enjoyed by about 8 people over two families sitting down one afternoon. There was some initial scrabbling around for spaces, but the game soon paced out well. The only issue was that it could get quite frustrating if the dice weren't in your favour when approaching corners - you missed out by one space or overshot by one space. That's the luck element I guess!

Wow.  From the detail in the mini cars to the detail in the board.  This game is great! While its suggested for 14+, the beginner mode was easy enough to teach my 7yr old.  The shifting mechanic adds to the racing feel.  While I've only played this with one other player, i could only imagine the intensity of having the board a little more crowded, adding obstacles. After 3 plays, this soared straight to my top games.  Awesome awesome awesome.  Looking forward to the extra maps

I like the game for having a different theme than the always-returning Middle Age trader adventures. Having said that, I still struggle to see the game as something more than just a lucky-dice-based game. I suppose I should play it more often, but then I need better persuasion skills to get my gaming friends to try this as well. A to-do for the future...
Edit 31/5/09: deducted one point from the game for the sheer reason that no-one wants to play this game with me... so it loses some of its brilliance in my eyes. Or I should sell the game better ;-)

An easy to teach racing game. I really wanted to like Forumla D, but it just takes too long for what is really just a simple dice rolling game. To minimise the effect starting high up on the grid, one should really race several laps with pitstops. However, it takes upwards of an hour to race just one lap. Traded it away.

I really like the concept, and the components in the new version are great. But IMO the game is just too long, and you spend an awful lot of time counting spaces and watching others do the same. The obvious solution to reduce game length is to reduce the number of laps, but then you're not getting the full effect of the damage penalties, which are a the most interesting part of the game.

This games excels with more players.  I recommend at least 4, but it seems it may rally shine and get competitive and fun with at least 6.  The basic rules are pretty easy to pick up, although everyone still has troubles understanding the Pitstop rules.  The examples in the manual are very vague and have many people scratching their heads on how to enter, where to stop, and how to leave.  Asmodee really needs to revamp their manual on this point.  Additionally, a lot of people make a mistake when rolling the Danger Die for collision.  Most people only look for rolling a '1', when the manual states it should be '1-4' and I don't know why so many people miss this.

I love the core mechanic in Formula D - the way gear-shifting corresponds to the values on the dice. But there are too many things I can't ignore, such as player elimination, massive downtime in bigger games, and the tendency for players to over-think what should simple moves. It's an interesting game that is too heavy for what it is.

This could be a great game if I could just get people to play it with me.  I start with the simple rules and do one lap, and then nobody wants to play a second lap cause it took so long.  But it is with multiple laps that the strategic aspects really shine because with only one lap you can just push your car to limit and not worry too much about losing all your car's hit points.

Surprisingly, this one is a hit with my wife. A great balance between strategy and luck - there's enough strategy to keep things interesting and enough luck that no one feels completely out of the running. Two players with 3 cars each can be pretty fun, too.

I've played this with a few "non-gamers" who loved it. The one problem I have is that a single lap on the default map feels too short, but playing an entire two lap game can begin to drag.

Played twice with different groups of people. Used basic and advanced rules, feel like basic is enough tension and allows people to take greater risks. A good game where maybe 3 bad rolls can ruin a game, but you might still have a chance to win even then.

The max I've played with is 6, not sure is it'll take too long or get too congested with more cars on the track.

Boring. I don't like games that simulate video games with tedious slowed-down decisions--why roll dice when a computer could do this "real time"? This game was way too simple--no decisions other than what gear and lane. I also disliked (a little less) Fearsome Floors, but I did like Cartegena, so not sure if it's the game or genre.

RATING: 8
Very simple rules, still deep in simulation and nice amount of optional rules to build up the style of race you'll love. Maybe a bit on the longer end for this depth of a game but doesn't matter to me that much. Huge amount of replayability even with one map - changes with different player amounts and optional rules you use.

RATING: 6.5
This is a pretty cool dice rolling race game. The 6.5 reflects my feelings after a single basic game. I do dig the shifting mechanics combined with the race track curves; they make for some interesting decisions with just a little bit of press-your-luck (which I normally don't enjoy much, but find fun here). I suspect that my score might go up a bit with the use of the driver cards to give each racer a more unique feel, but that initial play didn't quite grab me enough to want to stick with it.

As soon as this game finished I immediately decide to purchase an expansion for it. That says a lot for me. I really enjoyed my one play with 4 players. It was fast ~60 min and fun! It didn't feel too random and chaotic which was my main concern. It actually felt quite tactical and strategic. I saw people counting and figuring out probabilities when it wasn't there turn. The guy who won said he actually used racing techniques that he learned about. The production quality was superb which made a big difference. The game just screams fun for me! If you like chucking dice and enjoy racing then give this one a try!

For some: a risk management dice game with a whacky scoreboard.

For others: a well themed game where you can almost hear the doppler shift of the cars as they race through the turns.

Best with atleast 4 cars on the board (4 player or 2 player with teams), otherwise there isn't much tension and a bad roll or two will take you out of the game.

Fun (max) = function of number of players. 
It's a pure dice game, the one great idea is the usage of different dice for different gears. There are race games where players have more influence, Powerboats is a good example. Still, if you have more than 6 players, few games can beat a session of Formula D in its various incarnations.

Super fun big group game. The loudest game nights usually have formula D as we laugh an yell at the car crashes and bad push your luck rolls that send your car flying of the track when you should have shifted down, but lets face it, daring is more fun.  The kids like this too!!  But I will say the tiny cars are not big person friendly.

A :thumbsup: for Asmodee's remake overall. I have concerns about the long-term survivability of the dashboards around the gearshifts, and I already tore the undersides of most trying to pop the circles out (or, rather, my kids did that, bless 'em). If the street-racing side, literally and figuratively, doesn't appeal to you, then this is going to be about half the game that Formula De was, as it looks like Asmodee's at least initially going with expansion boards that are half-and-half. The car paint is a nice touch, although one of my cars didn't get half its wheels painted.

I played this with my three boys aged 6-10 and a couple other family members.  We had fun, but after several game plays I could tell the kids weren't as enthusiastic.  With 5 or 6 people at the table, it just takes too long between each kid's turn and they start to get antsy.  Maybe once the kiddos are a couple years older they might have the attention span for this.

If you play this fast paced, and hectic, it's a lot of fun. I probably need to amp the complexity though. It's a simple blend of roll & move with push your luck.

The third incarnation of Formula De. The rules have not changed, in fact, you are getting the first two games + the new street racing rules. Components are a wonderful step-up: prettier cars, gearbox, proper damage tracker and the addition of new drivers (with special abilities).

The only problem I have with the game is the lack of player-aids (for the standard game & the street racing rules). With all the different drivers and their special powers, I also expected a text summary on their cards. Other than that, it really is a fantastic buy and worth the money if you don't already own the previous versions.

Mucho más que simplemente "lanzar" dados y "mover" espacios. Mucha diversión. Supero las expectativas más de lo que me pude haber imaginado.26/07/2014

Primera carrera con 6 pilotos la adrenalina sube al igual que las revoluciones. Más estrategia aún si quieres no llegar de último o no dañar el carro 10/08/2014

Lo seguimos jugando y la seguimos disfrutando sobre todo mi hijo razón mas que suficiente para estar en nuestro Top 10 familiar.

Esperamos evolucionar a jugar con las reglas avanzadas 17/08/2014

Comenzamos a jugar el circuito nocturno...5 pilotos. Los ingredientes adicionales hacen difícil terminar la carrera. Castiga al que se lo tome como juego. Hay que saber correr. Definitivamente un muy buen juego 9. 11/09/201

Formula D is the ultimate Formula game for me. It's hands down the best and feels most like driving a car (where other games feel usually more brain puzzles, which are also fun).

For just a sibgle race, I'd rate it a 9.

People who get this game, and have fun with it make this an absolute blast!
League options, pushing your luck, cheering/jeering fellow drivers, so many house rules and variants to customize play...
It's a real gem, and has now officially landed on my "never trade" list.

The new edition is also beautiful.  I love the old artwork (outside of the craziness of some of the later maps...goofy graphics/characters, etc.) but these new maps are stunning, as well, imho.
Wonderful color, great graphics...FUN, FUN, FUN!

A nice simulation of both street and Formula 1 racing. I find the Formula 1 racing a little boring, as every car is the same, but it's quite a good simulation of the motorsport. I appreciate the street version more, as different character abilities and car statistics, along with the racetracks particular events, add a more entertaining edge to the game. Can drag a little with many players, but usually a fun game.

Update: On further plays I've dropped the rating to a 6. I always enjoy this game for ~1 1/2 hours, unfortunately it lasts at least 2...

Wow, a game that can play up to ten players.  Unfortunately, even with just four or five players the game already gets bogged down frequently by players precounting, counting and recounting before moving, as if somehow they could get just a little bit farther.  I now have implemented the house rule that you just "drive" your car the number you rolled.  No precounting and that tends to make the game move along at a more race-y clip.  I want all the expansions to this game.  Not sure why.

juego de carreras muy simple que consigue ambientar a los jugadores y que estos se adentren en la emocion de la formula 1, con sus riesgos, frenadas, adelantos, toques, paradas en boxes, prevision del clima junto a eleccion de neumaticos, accidentes, etc..

Se puede jugar con unas reglas simplificadas, y con unas avanzadas. Ademas aconsejo jugar con las reglas opcionales de metereologia y parada en boxes. Aqui es donde el juego brilla de verdad.

Añade la variante de competir por un circuito urbano, esto añade variedad a la formula 1, con sus pilotos personalizados y carreras llenas de eventos (incluso pasos de solo 1 carril).

Muy bien conseguido, aunque puede que necesite de expansiones (nuevos circuitos) para poder disfrutarlo completamente.

La contra más grande es la excesiva duración de una partida, que para lo que el juego es puede ser demasiado si no vives la carrera. ¡Y como tengan un poco de AP puede ser eterno!

Otherwise the game is perfect for multiple players.  I can see this being an exciting game for kids who have already mastered counting to large numbers.

Great fun!  Always enjoyed by whoever I introduce this game too.  Just enough strategy to keep you engaged but not too much to remove the social aspect of laughing at each others unlucky rolls when over shooting a turn or having an opponent get knocked out of the race!

Everyone can’t help make a revving noise when shifting gears at some point, when playing this game!

RATING: 6
Comes down to a roll-and-move dice game, but this is probably as good as a roll-and-move game can be. The gear changes and the way corners are handled simulates racing very well. Can cause some stand up and cheer moments and can be very engaging. Problems of a runaway leader (or loser) is possible and this might spoil the game for some. For me, a very good game to have in a collection.

More fun than I expected. From just reading the rules I thought it would be a boring roll-and-move, but then I discovered that the numbers on the dice don't necessarily start with "1"... This, coupled with the requirement of stopping at the turns, requires some strategic planning (and pushing one's luck). The gearboxes are a really clever gimmick.

RATING: N/A
The game mechanisms are a simple race, get to the finish line first! However, players have to use a significant amount of planning, and rely on quite a bit of luck. Each player manages when to shift gears, with each gear providing a different speed. (For example, 5th gear is a die that rolls random numbers from 7 to 12 for spaces moved.) Each turn, players may move up one gear, stay in that gear, or move down gears. This forces players to match possible rolls with the optimum distance for that turn, and hopefully plan ahead. However, speed is not the only issue! Corners have a "stop" rule that requires players to stop once, twice, or three times on that corner in consecutive turns or face a penalty. This creates an effective speed limit to the corners.

As I have said under many other games I am a fan of race games, and I will almost always never pass up a chance to try a new race game if presented with the opportunity. I have known about Formula D for awhile but hadn't heard anything that made me want to run out and try it as soon as possible. I am glad I recently had a change to try it. At its heart Formula D is one of the more simple racing games. You manage your car by shifting into different gears (different gears allow you to roll different die that will give you more movement the higher the gear you are). You are also managing home slow you are going through hairpin turns, go too fast around some of them and you will be out of the race with a destroyed car. You also have to manage damage that gets done to your car as you attempted riskier and riskier moves throughout the race. In the end the game is all about risk management and knowing when to take a little scraping of your paint job to stay in that higher gear so you can get back up to speed sooner than your opponents. Overall not a bad experience by any stretch of the imagination, but also nothing really grabbed me. I have played, and own, better racing games.

Best with more players, but down time between turns can be a problem.  You need to do at least 2 laps to even out the luck, and at that point it runs a bit long.  All that said, I really enjoy it.  One of the games that got me into the hobby.  I always think it'd be neat to have a Formula D league, with multiple races and a points system.  As it is i'll settle for playing sporadically.

RATING: 9
Un juego sencillo apto para todo tipo de jugadores. Fácil de aprender y divertido de jugar. Partidas rápidas que dejan con ganas de más.
Con las reglas avanzadas que permiten diversas modalidades de juego (campeonatos, formación de equipos, personalización del coche, influencia climatológica...) y el "contratablero" de la carrera urbana, así como la posibilidad de "encontrar" más circuitos por internet de la versión anterior del juego más los que se pueden comprar oficialmente, la rejugabilidad y la experiencia de juego se multiplican exponencialmente.

Un juego de carreras como este, si además te gusta la Fórmula 1, no debe faltar en tu ludoteca particular.

Para 2 jugadores puede resultar algo aburrido si uno de los contendientes pone entre él y su rival demasiada distancia, pero con más jugadores (!hasta 10 pueden jugar a la vez!) promete momentos emocionantes, tensos y divertidos elevados a la máxima potencia.

Basic Game Rating: 7

It is great fun, I've spent a few hours thinking what to say about this game and the only thing that appears in my mind is fun. There's some down sides, like the fact that it goes for hours if you have enough players, my last game was 6 players and we spent like 2.5 hours in a basic game, and for a "roll and move game" it's a long time. Strategies are not so much encouraged in the basic version, instead it's just a "how much spaces I have left" or "I need a 5 to get to the next corner", there's not a lot of luck management to be comfortable with. I'll wait until I play several times the basic game and also the advanced game to rate properly.

Definitive rating:

I've played lots of times and I want to add that I don't have the patience to play a "full" game of this. YES, it is fun, it is social, it's great with 6+ players, but it's SO LONG, that it's grinding wheels make me want to throw the game out of the window after the first lap. The "luck management" is taken beyond what I can bear. The strategy just banishes and the game becomes a huge joke after 1 hour of long dice-throwing blandness. The game lacks the deepness of a dice throwing game and the theme just isn't there for me (I'm just not a fan of racing) 

My friends love it and that's why I'll keep it, but I see FEW to NONE future games of this in my gaming history
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.3
This game is always a lot of fun with large groups and can be joined by about anyone but ... It tends to be too slow so the fun often comes from the group laughing and joking while waiting for your turn.
So if you're looking for a very strategic game then let this one pass.

This rating is for the basic game. I suspect with the more interesting options of the full game I would probably rate this a 6.

While the way turns work is done simply yet thematically and with some careful route-taking and obtaining wear you can definitely increase your odds of winning, the basic game of Formula D is still mainly coming down to the die rolls. Also, the aforementioned strategic options just didn't have enough flair to them: they are true to the theme but don't bring out the racing aspect enough, and how you play one part of the track is similar to what you do at another.

its ok.  i think i may not like racing games in general.

there is a reasonable amount of decision making when you choose to shift up or down, and whether to spend brake/engine/whatever points to squeeze through certain turns.  and the die-rolling results in some hilarious or awesome moments, but overall i find the experience unfulfilling.  

essentially its just roll and move.

I feel like I haven't played this with the right group, i.e., a large one.  I like the materials, though the cars are a little small, and the expandability with extra tracks is nice, if I'm ever inclined to go that way.  It's a nice, simple system.  Would be better if I were more into auto racing (not a theme I'm innately drawn to) or had a wide circle of friends I could set this up with.  Ultimately, may be a candidate for trade.

The only negative about this game is that it takes too long to play.

The biggest positive is that the game box is the most beautiful one I've seen!

Formula D is also the excitement of illegal racing in the streets of big cities - anything goes: custom cars, nitro acceleration, drifting in the curves, dirty tricks... The game mechanics stay the same, but use specific rules, cars and tracks.
You will also discover, in this new edition of Formula D, elements unseen up to now, such as painted race cars, dashboards, pilot profiles, and tracks... Very soon we'll unveil the new, high-tech elements which have been created in our ultra-secret lab.
Re-implements: Formula Dé

Ahh, a simple roll & move game...how fun could that be?

A FREAKIN' BLAST!

While I do love F1 racing, you don't need to in order to enjoy this fantastic game. Played in a large group setting can be roaring good time. It is easy to teach (Basic F1 game) but has a lot more strategy than one would think.

The little gearboxes you get seem like a gimmick, but really they add so much to the game and are a vital part of the action (keeping track of gears & damage). A light game for sure, but there is enough meat there to bring it to the table often...not to mention if you want to get serious there are the advanced rules and you can play season play!

Just plain fun.

For a car racing game, this is as close as you can get to the real thing. It mimics how a driver handles his car, with possible overtakes from those who may have lagged behind in the beginning, causing unexpected results in the end. After each game, however, I found myself pretty burned out from all the strategizing in the previous game, with no room for another round. I believe the game flows great with 3 -4 players, and too many with 5 or more players.

Not all of my gaming buddies are racing game fans, so this probably doesn't see the table as much as I would like it. It's more random than tactical, relying on dice rolls to determine your progress around the track. But I would argue that sometimes the decision on whether to risk a few popped tyres to get around a particular bend in the track while holding on to a higher gear die can sometimes venture into the tactical side of things. If, like me, you are willing to get all of the expansion tracks, why not run a Formula D championship? Let your friends have two cars each of the same colour as you play each track. Keep track of results for both the "drivers" (particular car) and the "constructors" (cars of same base colour). Over multiple sessions, keep the tally and then see who wins the championship in both categories!

Not recommended, you have to control multiple cars to make it worthwhile, and even then 2x2 isn't optimal, and with more cars it starts to feel like a chore where you're playing against yourself. 3p with 2 cars each is ok. 4 or more recommended.

Formula D is a roll and move game with custom dice and a clever mechanic for handling corners populating a race track. Each round, a player will roll a custom die associated with the gear and move that many spaces. It gets a little more complicated as each corner requires the player to spend a number of rounds in its boundaries or go spinning out of control. Pepper in custom abilities, tire wear, braking, bumping, slip streaming, and debris and you have Formula D.

Pros:

+ Components are great. Thick cardboard, custom racing pieces, painted cars, custom dice, and excellent artwork.
+ Easy mechanics, but also provides solid choices.
+ Corner mechanics are simple, but extremely effective.
+ When it works, it really works.

Cons:

- Too many players really slow the game down.
- Multiple laps add little to the game compared to the time invested.
- Down-time is a big problem. Each player has to count out their movement, sometimes multiple times during their turn.
- Street racer power do not seem balanced.
- Player elimination.
- Very luck dependent.

Final Thoughts:

Rating: 6.5 / 10: Formula D is a tricky game to give a rating. One game I will be having fun, another I will be counting down the minutes until it is over. Too many players or more than one lap (or heaven forbid a combination of too many players and multiple laps), the game drags to a painful crawl that I can't wait to get over. Everyone must be focusing on the game or the down-time between turns take forever. Add onto this the possibility of player elimination (that can happen in the first lap) and I groan when it hits the table.

Despite these issues, I do like the game under the right conditions. The game plays best when I am playing a street race with the advanced rules, the game is limited to one lap, and I am only playing with two or three other players. If I break these rules, the game falls apart and I am hesitant to get it back to the table.

Formula D will stay in my collection for now, but I will only bring it out if the conditions are right.

Played a couple of games now, good fun, if 5 or fewer people are playing it is often best to play pairs of cars per person, this ensures that the track is reasonably full and congested. So far only used the default Monte Carlo track on the 'Advanced' rules, 2 laps seems about right.
Unless you're playing with young children you can skip straight past the basic rules and go for it with the advanced from game 1.

I love the new "gear box" layout.  It's ingenious and it will save on the photocopying of the car sheet.  Granted, I used to erase the information, but the gear box streamlined the overall concept.  That's why the game goes from 7 to 7.5 for me.  

The game is still the same as the predecessor, so it's still a solid concept.  Nice to have it in print again for the one that didn't have a copy yet.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
In the summer, I had the chance to grab a last copy of Formula De, but passed because the box was damaged and the shop wouldn't drop the price accordingly. Luckily, along came Formula D! This is, without doubt, a fantastic (if none-too-serious) game, and much of the fun is down to the simple, but clever, gear selector and damage panel, which is much easier to manage than the old paper system. I know there are people out there who dismiss this as a dicefest, but that's okay by me - when I want to play it, I know what I'm getting, plus it's an easy access game for those who haven't played Brass (this includes me) or its ilk.

My only real criticism of the game is: "The cars are HOW small?!?" Teeny, tiny, oops-and-you've-lost-one micro cars. They're a bit fiddly for people with big hands, or anyone on their third-or-later beer.

As for gameplay, I much prefer the "serious" F1-style racing, but the street racing has gone down a bomb (we've dropped the stupid "pot-shots from a window" rule, though. There are already enough gimmicks without this naff nod to arcade racers. Just drive, man - you don't need all that chintz). Better with a lot of cars on the track as traffic can restrict options. It can be a bit perfunctory if there are fewer than five cars in a race, in which case I'd drop the score a lot. But six cars upwards... scores nine for a riot. And you can get anyone to play this. Anyone.

RATING: 5
Game in a Nutshell: A race around the track where you shift gears to roll different dice that move you a different range of spaces. Just make sure you gear down enough in the corners to land in the "stop-now-or-watch-your-car-pay-the-wrath" areas.

Played as: 4,7 player (beginner rules)

Pros:  An ingeniously simple game that capitalizes on its mechanic of using a different die for the different gears you can shift your car into. Between that and the needing to make stops in corners makes for some great decision making where looking ahead a couple turns (something not common in dice rolling games) gives you your best chance for success. The theme really blends well with the mechanics: the feeling of nailing a turn, jockeying for position inside the pack, and just all around pushing your car to its limits. And finally, the presentation gets a strong ‘A’ across the board... especially those sweet little gearboxes.

Cons:  I really don’t want to buy expansion boards and I’m afraid the tracks in the box might get old too quick considering what the cost of this game is.  It doesn’t have the same tension with fewer players as it starts to feel like more of a solo affair.  On the flip side of that however, with a bigger group, if players aren’t paying attention, the game can drag on way more then it needs to. Those two things make it hard to get the game to play to its optimum potential. Definitely does not have my favorite rulebook out there. Not overly strategic for the game’s length.

Other:  I’m still getting the initial beginner’s games out of the way so we can move onto the advanced rules. Basically I’m waiting for people to wrap their heads around how to keep the game moving at a rapid rate-- if you’re paying attention no one person’s move should last more then 15 seconds on average.  Maybe I need an extra set of dice.

Best Use: Not many "board" games out there that can handle up to 10 players so it kind of has its niche there.

Played this one at PAX this year and I loved it!  The shifting mechanic is what sold me on it.  I like Road Kill Rally for running over people but this has more tension for racing.  I would like to go on record as saying that the dice hate me in this game.  Additional note, you can't skimp on the two lap thing.  If you do single laps people have a tendency to just blow thru the wear points knowing they don't have to worry.  Ruins the tactical thinking of managing your wear

Gave this a go over the weekend. Lots of fun, and works well for non-gamers and gamers alike. 

I've heard there can be a runaway winner in some games, but my girlfriend was considerably behind the pack for a third of the game and managed to fly by into first for the next third of the track, so we didn't find that to be a problem. Not to say it won't happen, just that it hasn't happened *yet*. Conservative players (like my girlfriend) end up having more wear points, and are thus able to take greater risks (such as completely overshooting some corners) to catch up and take the lead, so in that respect, both conservative and risk-taking play styles have their benefits.

It would be very interesting to give the two lap race a go, I have the feeling it would greatly turn the tables. I slid in first with two wear points, Zach second with two also, Cherry 4th with 1 wear point and Riana 5th with 2 wear points. My girlfriend on the other hand came in 3rd with a whopping 12 wear points by comparison. Her play style would clearly dominate with a second lap, whereas the rest of us would certainly struggle. It's fantastic to see that despite having a conservative play style she was still able to secure a good result; as this shows that one play style is not necessarily rewarded over the other.

Looking forward to giving the advanced rules a shot, but really, this game doesn't feel dumbed down in the basic rules either, there's certainly a degree of strategy even with the basic rules that will be enjoyed by all.

Despite not being interested in Formula One racing, or racing in general, this has quickly become one of my favourites.

This one is very popular in my more casual gaming group. It is a "dicefest" with exactly the right amount of strategy and luck. All this combines to a very intelligent game design, especially when you play the advanced mode.

In addition, the graphical presentation is wonderful. 

In its own genre, it is definitely worth every buck and I've never had any problems bringing it to the table. People are always ready and willing for this.

I picked this up looking for something light and fun that would support larger numbers of players.  I'd give it a tentative thumbs up after one play, but it seems to have fallen flat with other members of the group.  Thus far the gang has been resistant to my efforts to give it another try.

This game, especially in a league format, is the most fun I have had board gaming.  My students and I have played it for two years and each race has become a weekly event.  The game has even turned me into a F1 racing fan...I knew all of the tracks!

I have an extra set of cars of both types for trade or sale.

Formula D is fun only if you are playing with the right people.  It isn't fun to play the game itself, it is mostly fun because of the interaction with others in between turns.  Really, if this is what you want, get the board game out of the way and just sit around and talk, it will be just as good.

In this game you race cars around a track.  We played with the one that came in the box, but there are tons of other tracks you can get.  You can shift into different gears, and depending on the gear you're in you roll a different die.  In first gear the die will only move you 1-4 spaces (I'm not sure on these numbers, it just gives you a general idea), in second gear the die has 3-7, etc.  So the higher gear you are in the further along the track you will go.  It gets tricky when you come to a turn.  On the turns the board has a section shaded off and a number next to it.  The number is how many times you have to end in the shaded section.  So if it is a sharp turn the number might say 2, and you have to stop twice in that marked region.  This of course means you need to down shift so you don't go too fast.  I think this is kind of a cool mechanic in simulating how it feels.

The other element in the game is damage, if you overshoot a turn, or bump into people, or downshift too fast, etc.  You can receive damage to your car.  We didn't play the advanced game, but it looks like there are pit stops to fix this damage.

The winner of course is the first player to be able to finish the course.  This game includes a lot of luck from the die rolls.  Maybe I was just having a bad night, but I kept getting further and further behind mostly because of the die rolls, not because of bad planning.

I give this game a 4 because it is just way too long to want to play much.  We only played once around the track, you are supposed to do 3, and it took us close to 2 hours.  It was kind of cool at first, but it just kept dragging, and dragging on.  I can only imagine how bad this would be doing 3 laps.  The amount of luck involved also threw me off.  If the game could finish in an hour or less it would get a better rating from me, but it still wouldn't be one of my favorites.

The beginner game is fun, fairly fast-paced, and chaotic. I enjoyed my first play at 5p. Going up to too high a player count may drag this down, but I see the 10p max as a benefit. I'm tempted now to try the advanced game but I am worried it will get too bogged down in lookup charts and customization. We'll see.

I like the new version it looks great even though some of my players are not too sure about the gearbox.  I wish they would have included some blank cards to build our own cars though.  I'm working on some right now because it's a little confusing without cards when you play with more than one car.

Still a great game strongly recommended, especially if you can get a hold of some of the older tracks.

RATING: 8
Roll dice and move your car to win the race.

Plays: About a dozen.
Type: Race game = a game where you race to be the first across the finish line..
Complexity: Family game = A game that is easy to teach and play.
# of players: Can seat up to 10, but probably best with 5. With too many players downtime will start being a problem and with too few players maneuvering will be too easy.
Playing time: 15 mins per player.
Player interaction: Opportunity prevention – blocking optimal driving paths.
Randomness: Medium – dice, but you decide the size of die to roll by shifting gears.

Replayability: Average. There aren’t wildly diverse strategies or that much depth to explore, but adjusting to the options that the dice give you will make every race different. The game decisions are interesting and tense.
Fun: High. This is a fun game, played with cheering and booing and laughing at the way the dice play out. It has glorious win or lose moments when you throw caution to the wind and go into the next curve on too high a gear, just to get ahead. 
Memorability: Low, race games don’t create great stories as a rule.

Thematic integration: Very good. This feels like a race where you are in the driver’s seat. The cardboard gearboxes and the little plastic cars add to the thematic connection.
Components: Very good. The board is large, good looking and functional. I particularly like the tiny numbers on the side of the road to ease calculations for the players, it shows care from the designers. The plastic race cars and cardboard gearboxes are great. It looks good on the table, when you set this up, people will want to play.

Who will like this: Gamers that want a family game with interesting decisions that can seat a lot of players. Probably people who find themselves with too many players for other family favorites like TTR.

Very light strategy game with such a broad theme it will fit into most game groups.  A single-lap race seems to lack much strategy, given the abundance of wear points one has at his/her disposal.  At times seems like a gussied-up "roll and move" - nevertheless, people still enjoy it.  Although I've never played it, the advanced game/leagues is were this game might really shine.

RATING: 7
Has a rather serious case of runaway leader syndrome, but still a very competent 'arcade' racer.
Great fun pushing your car hard into the corners and then watching it fly off the track backwards in a ball of flames.
Don't bother with the beginner rules; they encourage just pelting into the corners with no regard for wear points.

Takes a long time to play, which puts some people off. An hour per lap is not uncommon with a fair number of cars on the track.
Perhaps would have preferred more tracks with the base game, but it would've bumped the price and I doubt you could fit much more in the box.

i really enjoy this. i only wish i had a whole load more tracks so that i could then convince a set of people to play the entire formula 1 season on these tracks.

i haven't played it keeping score beyond a single race yet, but i think this would make the game even more fun because then people wouldn't have extremely risky moves that can make them crash easily.

is very exciting with a wide number of players, though if there are only two of you i would recommend playing a team of cars instead of just one (i think i'd recommend having a team of cars for each player until there are more players than there are teams of cars) traffic increases the fun!

We really Love the advanced rules and Street Racing.  This has been a nice find.

We picked up 3 additional sets of dice as well to speed up play.

Monaco Plays - 1

This is a really fantastic track and slightly modified from the original Monaco of Formula De.

The track is laid out in such a way that the field tends to stay relatively clustered. Various corners allow for multiple driving lines and gear strategies and the Pits offer a viable 'omit' strategy if your car is travelling well to make the next corner.

This game was a surprise for me.

With a surprising amount of strategy (I expected none), this game plays quick, tense and exciting. Shifting gears control which die you roll. Be careful though. Each car can only take so much before it is out of the race. Go too fast through a curve and they will be scraping you off the wall. You must also maneuver on the track to find the best route to set yourself up for the next turn.

No two races are ever the same! With being very simple to learn but hard to master, this game can most people.

The basic rules are basic - barely a step up from simple roll-and-move.

The roll and move mechanic is a great fit for this game. There is some strategy and push your luck mechanics buried into the gear selection option. It is fun to watch the race positions change during the game.

This game is ripe for house ruling and variants. We particularly like increasing the damage potential in the game by always referencing damage checks by the current gear. It is quite easy to adjust the rules of this game to suit any group's play style.

It is nice to have a game that can handle 10 people that is not a party game.

The first time I played, two completely different methods of play ended up being neck-and-neck to the finish, which I didn't expect - one methodical and mathematical / boring (me) and one much more reckless.

The second time, one good or bad roll may have been the difference between all of us. Haven't played many dice games, and generally not a fan, but this was a good intro to an alternative type.

Formula D is surprisingly large and is filled with cool components for a simple roll-for-movement game. The board is huge!

I thought the random nature of the dice rolling would piss me off, but the dice are custom made, each with a limited range of variability, so there is no chance of a player rolling a 30-sided die and getting a 1.

Roll-for-movement, single direction of travel, and one victory condition gives a really old-school feel, despite how tricked out the components are, which makes for a very limited play experience with little variation from game-to-game.

It is really neat that the circuit track and the expansion circuits are all real-life racetracks. Having switched from video gaming to board gaming, it is pretty nice to see all the tracks I've raced on in Gran Turismo miniaturized.

One definite issue with Formula D is a literal runaway leader problem. Because of the care needed not to pile into other racers in the corners, whoever gets an early lead will pull away from the rest of the pack and likely win the game.

RATING: 7
A great racing game.  At first you think that there is really no strategy here because you are rolling dice.  That is far from the truth, with the amounts of stops you need to make per turn and many different gears to choose from you can set yourself up for success every turn.

I still haven't played a full game of three turns around the lap, but mostly because I play with nubs that would blow up anyway so we all decide to finish after one lap.

Only played this twice now, and neither times with a large group (everyone seems to poo poo it for large groups).  What I know I love is the fact that its the Monaco Grand Prix.  I know I was wooed by this game's fluff and look, but I did enjoy the strategic lane changing and damage you can suffer.

First impression (4 players): The Formula side is the same as in previous edition. In the new one they have replaced player pads + paper sheets with a little bit better sticks-in-holes system but otherwise game is very much the same in both good and bad. See my comments for [gameid=173] if interested.

It might be fun to try the other side with illegal street races but I'm a bit skeptical about it.

Ribattezzato da chi me l'ha presentato 'Formula Dado' questo gioco si presta a partite lunghe con tanti partecipanti. Innegabile la fortissima incidenza della fortuna con un continuo lancio di dadi; non manca comunque un briciolo di strategia e una valutazione del rischio e delle probabilità. Il gioco si lascia giocare per la possibilità di allargarsi anche ad un gran numero di giocatori. Per via della riproduzione dei circuiti e delle auto il gioco è apprezzato dai più giovani. Vien sempre voglia di progettare non solo un gran premio ma un'intera stagione, il che richiede però tantissime ore. Tre giri mi sembrano il compromesso giusto, anche se già soli tre giri richiedono un po' di tempo soprattutto con l'aumentare del numero di giocatori.

This was not the die-fest I was anticipating.  Yes, you roll dice for movement but the different dice represent gears (d4, d6, d8, d12, d20, d30).  The lowest you can roll on a die is the near the max on the previous die.  Each die is a gear and you can shift up and down through the gears.  I took a shine to this one on the first play (I was a bit leary at first).  The minis are small but not so small that it is hard to manipulate them.  My only concern at this point is how long the game will stand up to repeated plays as everyone in the group gets more experience taking the turns.

Better graphics than the original.  Slight rule changes with being able to use brakes whenever.  The cars are a bit nicer (one piece) and get street cars.  Also, the gear box is easier and nicer than paper and pencil of old.

Finally got to play it.
A fun thing. At first I was'nt such a fan of race game (Ave Caesar, Top Race). But this (and also Snow Tail) gives another dimension on the raceformula.

Due to the fact I liked to play with the matchboxes when I was a kid, and I see almost daily my son playing with them now... I felt the urge to play Formula D on my own. And you know what : I enjoyed it.

Still need to find a way to play this quicker.

The silly fun I was hoping for.  Pretty simple rules, and lots of dice rolling.  The theme is great, how the car takes different type of damage/wear.  Nearing the end of the race, trying to figure out how to wear down your car just enough to get ahead for the straightaway.  There is something really fun about getting in to sixth and rolling the big die, cool game.

So boring. OMG so so boring. Put 10 people at the table and you might as well set up another table where you can play something else during your downtime. Might as well set up an Xbox in the other room as well.

The actual mechanics of play are fine. Smart, even. Love all the maps. I even rather enjoy the game when it's 4 players and everyone has 2 cars. Then you have some interesting tactical choices to make, running one car for speed and one car as a rolling obstacle.

I'd rather watch reruns of M.A.S.H. than play this thing tournament-style.

Interesting take on formula 1 racing. Players race around the track using different dice representing the gears on the car, the larger the gear the larger the dice and the further the car can move. Choices are usually fairly simple i.e. move gear up or down. Certain parts of the track (usually the corners) require players to stop within a range otherwise they damage their cars, once the car is fully damaged it's out of the race. The game allows you to scale to very simple easy races to more complex rules mirroring formula 1 experience with tyre & engine wear etc. Allows for lots of plyrs and the car components and gear sticks are a nice touch.

I bought this game simply for the dice.  I really didn't like having a 20-sided die determine everything.  Someone could roll it and say, "Oh, I meant to be in 3rd gear."  If you pick up the 4th gear die, there's absolutely no question what your intention was.  An added bonus: it added templates and pegs, so no paper is necessary anymore!  :)

Il gioco salva serata quando gli amici sono più di otto e non si desidera fare un party game. Una versione base, più dominata dal caso, per partite veloci e senza pensieri. Una versione avanzata per chi si diverte con detriti, condizioni meteo e dettagli dell'auto. In più, una versione Fast & Furious cittadina, immagino progettata per un pubblico più giovane.

Rispetto al padre Formula Dé, la grafica è stata rinnovata (un po' manga, ma gradevole) e i componenti rivisti (via il bloccheto di carta, sostituito dal cruscotto).

Non un capolavoro, ma strappa la sufficienza.

This is a roll-and-move racing game where the type of die you roll depends on what gear you're in, and how fast you want to go is determined by the game board.  The car's "dashboard" player boards were pretty neat and thematic, with the physical stick shift, but I really wish there was a player aid that told you what car parts were associated with what hazards.  I thought it was a decent racing game, but I'm no connoisseur of the category.

This game is a blast. A lot of components but very straight forward gameplay once it clicks. I don't know if you'd consider this a "sports sim" (I guess that depends on whether you'd consider racing a sport) but it really does mimic the decisions drivers have to make in racing. Slowing down into the turns, etc. BIG board, fun gameplay, highly recommend.

We played with both beginner and advanced rules including the road races. With beginner rules this game was a great fun! A lot of pushing your luck but totally awesome way to spend your time. This game is more like destruction derby than a formula, it tends to be so crash-oriented.

Advanced rules were perhaps at times a bit too strict and hard to use. Beginners rules were fun enough and still offered a good number of options.

I like a lot of the ideas going on here.  I like the variable dice based on gear shift.  It's got some interesting push-your-luck.  I like the little pegboard thing.  I think my main problem is that I'm not so big on car racing, so it's just a lot of time spent looking at cars and a looong track.  I think I could get over that a little if I tried it with more players to make it more tense.

I loooove this game, it is really simple and it reaches the primitive desire to win we all have. It is a hoot to play with non-gamers and gamers.

Even with lots of dice, chance is managed by the player CHOOSING the dice he wants to use, in this, choosing low risk chance or high risk chance. It is also really exciting because even if someone has been last for a long time, two good choices can help catch up.

I don't think I'll sell this. I have the Austin and Nevada track, and look forward for some others. Amazing game.

Reasonably entertaining with any number (though better with more). The problem being the standard ones with large-player games-- length, player elimination, etc. Crunching numbers sucks some fun out of the game, but is almost essential to keep from blowing your car up in games with more than 1 lap.

Best if played campaign style, with a series of heats and points. Still, a great light game for entertaining bunches of people.

The game was first introduced to me from a tabletop video. I felt it was one of the funnier games I've seen played, only to realize that it really wasn't played with all of the rules. This game can get very complicated with several people playing, and the game can last for a very long while with 6+ players. It was entertaining to say the least.

My favorite player was Li Tsu Sin. And the car that I was was my favorite car. It was blue. The game played great. And I've won every time I played it. I won because every time me and my Dad were neck in neck. My Dad was the yellow car with purple stripes. I went really fast. I could not go in to 6th gear until I played a huge gane of Formula D. The track was a vey long track. In fact the other side was night instead of day. I mean the other side of the board. Not just a regular board, a game board. Its one of my favorite games!

You race cars by rolling dice. It sounds simply but it is actually much more in-depth. Your vehicle subsystems can be individual damaged. Damage to those subsystems can cause you to fail. But you can also "intentionally" damage systems to drive hard and fast. The dice rolling bothers me surprisingly little because its push-your-luck style. I love this game and probably always will. I wish I could play it more.

As a rule, I don't like roll-and-move games. But every rule has its exception. Formula D is a tremendously fun racing game, with a lot more strategy thinking than it appears at first. Particularly if you play the advanced rules, it is actually a resource management game coupled with a strong push-your-luck mechanic.  And the components, from the dice to the micro-cars and tracks, are simply beautiful.

Talk about different! I love the little cars and the gear boxes. Unfortunately once somebody gets ahead, it's hard to catch them. One bad roll can mean you lose before the game is half over.

Pretty meh. We played our first game with the wrong rules that you can skip gears when accellerating too. Was more fun and tactical than the real rules where skipping only applies to slowing down.

We play this at my club whenever there are too many players to play a "regular game" (5 or 6 players).  Indeed, this is a game where the more, the merrier, because on a trafficked circuit players will interact (both willingly and unwillingly) a lot.

The games is light-hearted and fun.  My only gripe is that the dice, especially on high gears, have huge potential to totally erase any advantage a player may have painstakingly accumulated by strategising until then.  I would love the game a lot more if luck was somehow less dominant in determining the winner.

I like The cool dice but the game sort of encourages and discourages counting spaces for movement slowly, which wrecks the pace of the game. Most of the time when you get to roll the cool huge die, you then blow up from passing a curve too fast. Kind of overall dull as a result.

Beautiful board and nice miniatures.  The dice are great and easily recognized.  The gearbox is brilliant.  However, in the end, this game has too much luck based on whether players land just in or just before a turn, especially for the duration.

Fun racing game. There are a good number of things to think about while playing, without anything getting overwhelming. It's pretty fast and easy to teach too. The dice can be frustrating though, and when you're playing with a large group of people it's very easy to get totally cut off and/or take damage because of where everyone else's cars ended up without anything you can do about it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
This one is a ton of fun.  I love taking the damage in different areas, and how the different dice work with shifting and moving through corners.  It's a really clever way of forcing you to slow down through corners.

Much like RoboRally, part of the fun of this game is the chaos that can happen with enough cars all jockeying for the same positions.  With that in mind, I think it works much better with at least 5 or 6 cars.  When we play with just the two of us, we take 3 cars each just to keep the numbers up.

9 - This game is likely to get more plays than other games in my collection due to the simplicity of getting into it.  There aren't any super complex rules and the rules that exist can easily be arranged on a crib sheet (which I've printed out and stuck in the box).

RATING: 8
It is very difficult to find perfect balance between 'speed' and 'simulation' aspects in racing games. Formula D makes it very good, proposing quick gameplay, but with enough opportunities to make tactical decisions during the race. 

Basic game mechanism is luck-driven, as dice rolling is involved, but you roll different die depending on which gear your car is currently driving (e.g, on 2nd gear you can roll results between 2 and 4, while on 4th gear possible results are between 7 and 12). In addition players have possibilities to influence the result (like braking, which uses up your brakes) or take the risk(like taking the turn with high speed, which uses up your tyres). In the advanced mode the player can also prepare the car before the race to suit the driving habits, on the other hand weather can influence the race, forcing players to change tyres in pit-stop.

Although simplified, I found all racing aspects nicely included in the game in a way that makes the race quick and competentive enough, while sufficiently managable. Solid racing game, indeed!!!

Both Formula D (newer) and Formula De (older) are both good games. I really like the record trays you get with Formula D even though you can make some similar to this for your older Formula De game.

RATING: 7
Added my own rules for team play and eliminated downtime. Team play upshift it from a 6 to a 7!

.:Best 5-8:.
- If there is a lack of players, a player may control 2 cars. Use other type but same color car to designate the second.

My Notes
Rule 1: Pole Position 
Higher number corresponds to a lower number such that the sum in number is the same between all teams. 
E.g. Assuming 6 players Player in pole position 1 is placed with 6. Pole position 2 is with 5 and so forth. So, all the team numbers add to 7. 

Rule 2: Collisions
Players of the same color team is not penalized.
E.g.
Driver Blue A is behind another Blue B but Blue A is next to a Green car. Blue A makes a check for Green only.

Rule 3: Slipstreaming
Players of the same color team may end turn early to benefit from slipstreaming.
E.g. Blue A has one more move left but ends their turn early behind Blue B. However, Blue A is next to a Green car. After the check for the Green, Blue A slipstreams in front of Blue B.
- This makes for an interesting decision between risk-taking versus risk-adverse: few more movement spaces or avoid collision?

Downtime- Added another set of dice
Basic rule is that if the car started to move in front of you, you get move too (roll beforehand).

Used two sets for both sides of the table: one counter clockwise and the other clockwise. Counter clockwise side are odds- 1,3,5,7,9; clockwise are evens- 2,4,6,8,10. So, the dice will start with 1 and 2 pole position and will work its way down to the last players. Therefore, the dice only have to jump across the board once though inevitably players will change order. It adds to the chaos of racing, and I suppose this mechanic follows the story arc well. hahaha

I actually took the time to re-evaluate this game and it was more interesting than the first time I played it. I read the rules a little more carefully this time and had a much better experiennce than I previously had. I want to introduce some others to this game and explain that a race only needs to be 1 lap at most. The components of this game are quite nice, and I like what Asmodee has done with the character sheets and shifting mechanic. This game deserves a proper review!

Not particularly deep, but fun. Makes for a fun-filled hour (or two) of dice rolling and cheering. Immersive gameplay too. This game definitely fills a niche. On the downside, I always find that a game takes a bit too long - it can outstay its welcome. And I come to that assessment having only every played one-lap games with a small group. I love that the game supports rules for weather, tyres, pits etc.. but the thought of playing more than one lap gives me a bit of a sinking feeling.

Superb production quality. Fast setup. It's downsides are the runaway leader problem that occurs from time to time (very thematic to Formula One, though!) and the amount of luck that it has (after all, it is a roll-and-move game at its core, with a little bit of risk and resource management). I'm under the impression that this game could be incredibly improved if it had some kind of card-playing mechanic. Nevertheless, a fun game and possibly the most fun boardgame emulation of car racing avaible so far in the market. Best in championships or 3-lap races with 4+ players.

Initial rating 7 after 2 plays of the basic game.  This game is essentially an advanced roll and move mechanic.  The basic game all seems to be about knowing when to shift and when to take a little wear to make it through the turn the fastest.  Lots of luck involved as we are talking dice here, but I have no problem with that.

I have read through the advanced rules and will be playing that next time out.  I like the idea of "customizing" a car and having specific drivers.  The optional weather and tire rules I'm not so sure about yet - but will likely give them a try... at least weather for certain.  I wouldn't be surprised if the rating moves slightly upward after playing with advanced rules - time will tell.

Positives : High fun factor for me.  Theme goes over well with my two sons.  Cars are neat (but very small by necessity I suppose).

Negatives : Seems like a multi-lap race could drag on and overstay its welcome.  Can be apparent midway through the race that someone is close to "running away with it".  Crashing sucks if you only have one car in the race (so don't crash, eh? ;) )

Nothing more straight forward than a racing game....1st one across the line wins.  So far, we've only played the simple game (total of 18 damage points before you kill yourself).

While this game takes quite a bit longer than your average filler, that's basically all this is. And that's its biggest problem. It's a pure dice-chucker - you do have some decisions, but they're not very hard. I don't think there is much, if any, strategy here - but that doesn't stop it being tolerable (and occasionally even fun) to play when brought out once in a while. Well, at least for the first 15 minutes - but this game takes an hour or more...

We played this at UCON 2012. The Sydney expansion actually, but that's sort of irrelevant.

Lessee. I liked this game. Mindy took 2nd place. It took a while to learn, but that has a lot to do with the teacher and environment, etc.

It was much different than I expected from a racing game. Very interesting mechanics and similar enough to Robo-Rally that I think I will be purchasing it someday soon.

My problem with the game:
Too Long. We play for like 3 hours. ARGH!

This is fixed by getting better at the game, keeping turns moving fast, and even maybe limiting laps to 1 instead of 2. Also we played the advanced way, on an advanced track lol. So yea, theres that.

Cool game. Reminded me of like a table-top RPG in a way, all the diff dice, and everyone interacting on their turn, pretty cool.

I am giving this a 9. Only because the thing takes too long. Loads of fun, we laughed, we cried, one dude's car blew up (I think that was Sca-Boy Dave) and of course some punk who already knew how to play stole Mindy's hard pressed victory.

Fun. Play it. You'll be surprised I think. Bet my hick family would like this game actually. Bet it could be a gateway into more advanced boardgames (they like NASCAR) or even... dare I say it... Rolepalying!

:P

I feel the same way about the base system as I do about Formula De, but there are several elements to this version that I like better. I like the street racing version of this game with character special powers, nitro boost, etc... and I like that there is a simplified, basic version of the game which will make it more accessible and a lighter experience.

 The standard race duration (3 laps) is just too long, some players lose all options to victory by the end of the second lap. But playing 2 laps unbalace the tire types optional rules, as softs degrade on third lap so part of its disvantage gets voided. 
 It's a game that really gets better and with more options with the bigger number of players, but on the other hands it becames much more slower, and the downtime is almost unbearable with 6 or more players.
 The game cannot avoid a feeling of amateurish work over the optional rules. It really could get much better with a bit more development.
 
 The score is for the standard F1 game. The "whacky wheels" variant is just lame. Completely unbalanced racers and lack of options to interact. Unfortunately some expansion circuits come with a F1 track and a street racer track.

RATING: 5
Formula D is a fast paced game of car racing where players are race car drivers racing around a racetrack  by rolling dice that represent each gear in your car.  The role determines how fast your car will drive. the tricky part to this game are the turns where if you  go too fast you could burn out your brakes ,damage your car or even total your car, taking you out of the race. The game is not complicated at all but it is surprisingly enjoyable for how basic this game is. It is the gear shifting aspect that makes this game more than a roll and move game.

Pros: fast easy gameplay, Fun gear shifting mechanism, fun components( gear shifters) adjustable length board game determined by how many laps before hand. No setup required.

Cons: Basic roll and move at heart. Can have clear winner halfway into the game. Extremely luck based.

Amazing game. Fun mix of dice chucking and strategy. Easily accessible, rounds go quick with not much downtime between. Easy rules and more complex ones that you can accommodate to your group. Can be played seriously or with some drinks. The gear boxes are very neat as well. Highly recommend, although is a bit pricey and takes up a lot of space.

Nem is gondolná az ember, hogy ilyen egyszerű szabályokkal, ennyire könnyen le lehet modellezni egy autóversenyt. Nagyobb társaság esetén (4+) ideális választás!

Könnyed, kockadobálásban nagy kedvenc, hiszen azért az agysejteket nem kell szétégetni közben.
Maximálisan adja az autóverseny feelinget, a race game-ek között toronymagas favorit.

Really emulates the mechanisms of racing in fun ways, as long as players are moving along quickly. The circumstances in which different parts of your car take damage can be tough to remember and make what should be a visceral experience a bit fiddly. I'm very ambivalent about this game - it can be fun, but the potential slowness and muddy statistics can ruin it.

I like this game. I have to admit that I still have not played the game with enough players to give it a fair judgement. I really like the components and gameplay. I like the push your luck aspect of the game. If you try to go too fast you can really tear your car up and potentially crash and lose completely. Fun game so far but I want to play with six or more players. Based I what I have played so far I know that I enjoy the game, I am just waiting to see how much better it gets with more players.

have sold and bought again many times, just can't get quit of this awkward but lovely design. dont be so concerned with the difficulty of winning 1st place from a last position, moving up in rank in a race is a real accomplishment. Best played as a series of games, a season of races. The drama in the dice, the push your luck, taunting the curves to wreck you, it just works. 

I'm not convinced that the adv rules add much except for players who have played a lot.

recommended. I keep coming back to it. Others have fancier mechanisms, but this one delivers excitement reliably (as long as you don't let people AP & count out spaces--it's a race game, use a timer if necessary, but it should keep moving at a good pace).

Very nice light roll and move race game, which provides interesting choices to the players during gameplay, like how fast you want to go, what kind of risks you want to take, and how to move around and run over the curves.  Nevertheless, the time that I played a guy, that wasn't even the one explaining the game, insisted that we should play the game as he thought were described in the [i][url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/6539]Fomula Dé Mini[/url][/i]'s rules.  With that, some decisions were pulled from the players, since he invented a lot of movement restrictions in the curves, causing the game to lose some of its beauty, that is having different alternatives in order to chose the one that will insurance the best performance.  Later we found out that the way we played wasn't even the one described in the [i]Fomula Dé Mini[/i]'s rules.  I certainly would like to play the game with the right ones.

this one's a strange one.  If you play the "light" flavored game, it's pretty simple and straightforward rolling game.  Make sure you play multiple laps otherwise the game can be over pretty quickly as the damage doesn't really come into play much.  If you play the "advanced" flavored game, it's really strategic and a lot of fun.  Plus with more people it's more fun as well as you can draft, damage each other, each driver has specific skill bonuses.  The only complaint I have is that the cars are REALLY tiny, but they have to be to keep the board manageable.  As it is, the tracks are huge.  Pick up another set of dice to keep things moving as well if you have more than 3 people playing.  Handing dice back and forth gets old.

A fun, light racing game. I like the decision making regarding how to adjust your gear based on where the curves are, but the random chance to take damage based on various things takes away from the strategy, and can randomly kill you through no fault of your own. The tracks based on real tracks are better than the ones that the designers made up.

This game is a winner in my books. You really feel like you're racing. Has a great theme and I love the components and artwork.

We played only the simplest game. The mentioned problems would be even worse with advance rules. 

The game has a serious problem: it needs as many players as possible to work, but there's just too much donwtime. And often you can't really think about your move much before your turn comes. It fits groups which talk and make their own fun while they play. Pitchcar is for me better in every way - more dynamic, faster gameplay, less rules. 

Actually I found Mississippi Queen better: less people = less downtime.

EDIT: played advanced rules. Oh God, this game is nuts. The level of downtime is just unbearable.

This game has awesome components and the boards are beautiful. The game also has lots of replayability with constantly expanding map pool. I really enjoy playing this game though the downside is that the game takes pretty long time to play, especially if you do multiple laps. Most of the time we end up only doing 1 lap, which seems to have significant advantages to the player starting in pole position. Nevertheless it is a great push your luck game and I am sure I will continue to enjoy this game in the future.

A prettied up version of Formula De? Yes please!

Rating is for new edition.

Asmodee have not only blinged up the new Formula De, they have also ameritrashed it.

You can play standard rules (no change from previous edition) or you can play with a whole host of special characters and rules. These are inspired by Fast and Furious no doubt. There's weather, there's snipers, there's bonuses for speeding past police stations...

The graphics and new player 'gear boxes' are amazing. The package is a whole heap of fun with lots of room to customise races, cars and characters. Sure, there's player elimination but once expansions get released, there's no reason why the eliminated players can just start another race!

I realized in the third corner that when the others said "we'll play a short game with only 2 instead of 3 rounds", what they meant was 4 hours instead of 6. Oh my goodness does that game drag on forever and ever.

Also, I dearly hope for the game that we misplayed the rules, because otherwise I would have to consider them seriously broken: Speed 10 -- easy peasy, you make it around the corner. Speed 15 -- you are way too fast and leave the race prematurely. Speed 20 -- you are so fast that the corner doesn't realize you're there, so you are fine.

You won't catch me dead playing this again; At least not with 7 players, and not with these rules.

This is a game I learned in physics class called vector racing with much nicer components and an element of randomness via adding dice.  This game is highly enjoyable and addicting.  Plus you add the push your luck element of I'll make that corner on the next die roll.

RATING: 6
Good racing type game. Lovely componants and rules just about do the job in explaining most of the finer points.

Can see why some love and loath this, as although it is quite fun with several opponants, it can get a bit over analytic when looking at the possible moves your car can make. Thus making the game a lot longer than it should be.

Still a enjoyable game though

UPDATE:

Traded for Paperback as never could get to the table. Shame...

A decent push your luck racing game. The mechanics are good and the different dice and gears are interesting. The game is fun and crowded at first but the cars usually space farther and farther and the excitement fades quickly. The game drags way too long and sometimes it's usually more fun to crash your car to get the game over with.

Vroom, vroom!  Originally I wanted to get the older version of Formula Dé due to the "street" racing portion of Formula D.  But after playing the newer Asmodée edition, I think it is very well put together and eclipses the original.

With good decisions, you can keep yourself in a tight race for the lead, but a few bad rolls of the dice in a row will probably spell for your end.  On the Monaco track, there aren't many opportunities to gear up to 6th, but when they arrive, have fun nailing it.

Szerencsejáték, de a profi verzió jól kidolgozott ahhoz, hogy élvezetes legyen a verseny. Jó kis autóverseny, amely izgalmas hangulata egyértelműen nagy játékosszámnál jön ki. Gyönyörű a kivitelezés, hatalmas szép tábla, kis gumi autók. A játék teljesen rendben van, a hatos osztályzat egyszerűen annyit jelent az esetemben, hogy ilyen mértékű szerencsét hosszabb játékban annyira már nem igazán szeretek.

Really simple to pick up and lots of fun with large groups. There are also a lot of maps available for variety and optional advanced rules if you want something a bit meatier. Of course it being heavily reliant on dice rolling, luck is a big factor, but it feels like it's all part of the theme.

Great game if you have a large game group and want something everyone can play.  They don't give you enough points (and some racers are in dire straights to start with no way to improve) to truly customize your driving.  It's mainly drive in circles, do 1-2 neat things, use one special and you're done.  Recommend running only one lap.

More of the same.  It looks great. 

The street map is fun, lots of zany things going on.  I can't imagine trying to do more than one lap of it though as there is just too much random damage that is dealt out.

Pretty fun game, though extremely luck based.  Some skill is involved however, because there are a lot of decisions to be made. For example, should I downshift to make the turn, or stay in my current gear and sacrifice some wear and tear on my tires? Should I change lanes to avoid the debris, or risk damaging the body of my car in order to stay in the fastest lane?  Shifting gears for certain parts of the track is a lot of fun!

We played our first game last night (after me not having played in about 5 years) and we played that you could not count spaces; when it got to your turn, you had to decide on a gear and roll the die. It worked out great and we had a good time with my friend limping to the finish line without any wear points left (we may have played wrong and he should have exploded). Highly recommended if you play quickly.

I was fortunate enough to play in an eight player game, and boy was it fun. We played the simpler version (the easier side of the dashboard) but it was well worth it since we had a few non-gamers join in (who got the hang of it and loved it). This was really a blast watching everyone dodge each other and try not to wipe out when the track was jammed full of cars.

Given that it's basically a giant roll-and-move with interesting dice, it's surprisingly fun. But the rating falls to probably a 6 if you have players who are unwilling to trash talk or make the mandatory gear shifting sounds. I mean, you should lose your turn if you don't make the gear shifting sounds. Rating goes to at least a 9 if Grace Helbig is playing.

It's still Formula Dé!

Our first play was on the street race side. There are some cool additions, such as the nicer bits, the improved pit stop rule (for Formula races only), and the different driver statistics/powers. But in the end the game is like its predecessor: too much luck of the dice rolls, and WAY too long! I'd much rather play a different racing game.

RATING: 5
This is just a roll-and-move game.  They've added some rules to it that convolute it in an attempt to give it some more interesting decisions, but all they do is convolute it and turn a game that should at the very least be accessible into something that takes way too long to teach for what it is.

The only real decisions that are left to the players is whether or not to shift up or down but really there's not a lot of decisions to make there.  Most players will be left shifting in the exact same way on each turn and all that's left then is luck of the roll.

This game does accommodate a good number of players though and looks good with a lot of content and some really solid pieces.  That's all that's good I can say about it though, as the player number rises so does the down time and in a 6-player game I quickly found myself getting bored just 3/4 through one lap.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
A roll and move racing game. It was a bit better than a regular roll and move game as you can decide which gear you want to be in and that changed the dice. I found we were all just constantly counting spaces on the board, so it got boring rather quickly. This also resulted in significant downtime between turns.

RATING: 8.5
English translation of D rules worse than 2008 reprint of Formula De. Instead of two bi-fold backprinted boards like De, D has two quad-fold boards; new cars are poorly painted and smaller than De cars.

The street racing addition to D includes 10 pre-generated characters; the street rules add only about 4 rules to the regular rules. A lot could be done to spice up the street racing.
The game itself is great to play, however, with my only issue there being the longish play time for multi-lap races.

There's nothing wrong with Formula D. It is a clever way to implement racing, and there are some interesting decisions to be made. However, the decision is the same every turn, and while there are variations on tactics, you're playing the exact same strategy as all other players.

If I knew a racing fan, I'd play this with them in a heartbeat. Heck, I wouldn't say no to Formula D if someone brought it over. But I don't find it very satisfying.

However, there's no arguing that this latest edition has stupidly great components and is lovingly made.

A GREAT game for what it is, a dice fest with a LITTLE tiny bit of luck mitigation...but GREAT nonetheless. I have bought, and will continue to purchase, every track released for this game as they are what make it infinitely re-playable. We always play with three laps as this seems to be the best way to mitigate the luck of the lead driver and gives everyone else a chance to catch up. 
Warning: This game works best with 3-4 people AT MOST. Otherwise, plan on spending the whole day playing one race.

I have about as much interest in Auto Racing as I have in descending into wreck and ruin, which is to say lack of interest that transcends into proactive avoidance. That being said, I am in absolute rapture with this game. I ignore the Formula 1 theme and view it as a risk Management game. In that, it's a huge success. Not only is it challenging and fast-paced, it's actually a lot of fun.

[1 play] Initial reaction rating.  I have played the older Formula De game once also.  This seems to be almost the same game.  I love racing games especially car racing ones.  So the theme has a lot of appeal to me.  I think it has just the perfect amount of strategy and calculating to make a person feel well in control of their own fate.  Yet enough luck and randomness so you can take risks or play it safe and have some unexpected results or things out of your control just like a real race.  The fact that there are so many maps and things is very cool too.  I would not mind owning this game and for sure would like to play it again.

If we had no other games to play at game night, I could see this one being a weekly hit. The basic rules are fun, but there is so much more to add. It doesn't get much play during our game nights just because there are so many other games to play and this one takes some time, especially for our larger group. I could also see the betting types having a whopping good time with this.

You need some lively friend to play with it. I have to take a trail of the advanced game rules for more comment.

Not too much to this one as it is very much luck based with the dice though there is a very small of skill of knowing when to take the corners and try to slip stream. Son likes this which was the main aim in getting this. Should play with 2 cars per person if 3 players or less otherwise the game outstays it's welcome if this is done with 4 players or more.

Note: I'm not a big racing game fan so my review is obviously a bit biased.

The overall idea is neat, and it is fairly straight forward, but I feel like it is very repetitive and kind of "solvable" by simply playing the law of averages (and pushing it a bit when you're behind). Never feels that exciting because of the luck of the dice and can often result in someone getting very lucky or unlucky and making them almost instantly win or lose. Still a decent entry point to games I guess, but not something I enjoy playing.

Fun game under the right circumstances. 

Specifically:
Players must roll and move quickly.
Players should start with 2+ cars each.

If you are violating either of those two suggestions, you are dramatically increasing your risk of playing a dull game. This is not a deep or complex game, and it is easy to fall behind in a race through no real fault of your own. Having a team of cars can make that serious problem less so.

Very much a game of "must be played with the right group."

I ended up purchasing this for two reasons.  One, I really wanted the new dashboards, I wasn't a big fan of writing on the dashboard things with pencil and crossing them out, erasing, etc.   I thought it was a little cheezy. 

Anyway, I was working on little dashboards with poker chips and stuff, but never managed to finish one I really liked.   None of the ones in the Files section really matched what I wanted.

Finally I needed some more freaking Formula De dice.

Well, here's my opinion.  I've only played once since I got it.  I don't think I'm a fan of the dashboards.  It's a little hard to move the shifter though I guess I could get used to it.    I'm glad I got some dice though.  I really need about two more sets though.

I wish I liked this game more, but the size of the board and table required, the lengths of the games, plus the dry theme, which I am not huge into, does a dent in this game review.  This isn't a game I would refuse to play, but I certainly would not pick it to play or buy it.

I think it is funner to watch than it is to setup and play.  Kicking back on the couch watching others play it is how I would enjoy it.

All of this being said, the dice and press your luck elements do this game well and the theme is well matched to the mechanics, even if it is a bit dry.

This one is fun!  I want to play it more.  My friends really enjoyed it, save one, who always asks that we please, please not play, and indeed quit after one lap of their first playing.  But for the rest of us, onward!  One minor quibble, at least in the included main track, 6th gear is rarely used, but that might be inexperience talking.

Good: The gear shifting is a fantastic mechanic which in one swoop makes you feel like you are really racing cars and adds push-your-luck element to an otherwise standard racing game.

Bad: If someone gets that one lucky roll, it's incredibly hard to catch up to them.

A major part of why I like this game is because I am such a big F1/Indycar fan. I like how you have to control your speed through the corners and manage your tire ware. I also like how there is a preferred racing line through a corner although the line on the board is not at all accurate to the racing line on the real world track. I think the danger dice mechanic is flawed but this is still the best Formula 1 style racing game on the market.

This is a great racing game with cool dice.  It has more choices than meet the eye at first glance.  It makes sense to be slightly reckless, and to "use up" your car as you go, without going too far.  Large gains can be made in the large gears, so setting yourself up for that is the complicated part.

I like this played as a fast, grab-a-die-and-roll game and as a slow, count-your-spaces game.

They are both fun if you don't take either too seriously.  The real fun is getting a lot of cars jammed into a corner anyway. It is mandatory to play with at least six cars no matter how many players there are.

I hold Asmodee's treatment of Formula D up as the ideal reprint: 

1) It improved or equaled every component of the original -dashboards and cars are better, boards and dice are equal.

2) A well-regarded set of rules remained the same. Fantasy Flight outsmarts itself in this way from time-to-time even if the game is not that old.

3) A bold, new option was added, but to little detriment to the old way of playing. I refer to the Street racing option. Some will argue the detriment as it did lead to a slower re-printing of the actual Formula 1 tracks. However, I submit it did little harm because...

4) They made the game completely compatible with the older version. Players can pick and choose when it comes to components and, yes, all of those old tracks are still good. Plus, owners of the old tracks get some interesting new tracks with the street racing if they like. Asmodee even accommodated the anti-street racers by publishing more official tracks than street tracks. The pro-streeters largely like the official tracks anyway.

5) They continue to support the game with two new tracks coming out at least once per year.

An all around great job by Asmodee.

By the way, how many games scale well from 2-10 players! Answer: None

Update:  Moves from 7 to 7.5.  When played more quickly this really is fun.  Understand that this is really a press- your- luck game with a lot of theme.  Embrace this and you will find it is a lot of fun.  The decisions, though riddled with chance (and possible imbalance with the dice distributions), are interesting and meaningful.



Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 1
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 1
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 5
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 3


Overall - 1.25

I like this game more than the rating suggest, but it's really just a probability game with arithmetic on the side. It's easy enough for my son to play and enjoy, but some strategy that my gaming group was considering a season at one point. I'll play it, but only in the four to six player range. I tried it with a higher player count before and it long. Also, only play two laps. It adds much more strategy than a single lap race.

RATING: 6
The mechanics are quite creative and work very smoothly.  The game can be fun, but the die rolling can be fairly brutal, and bad luck tends to force you into increased risk which puts you in a downward spiral.  Which is discouraging in a fairly light-hearted racing game.

In lower player counts it seems like one player tends to get out ahead and coast from there.

I feel like you should get a DRM based on your current position, ranging from -/+ 1 to -/+ 3.  That would provide a decent catch-up mechanism.  The slow pokes would be able to drive a little more aggressively (with slightly reduced risk) and get back in the game.

First Impression:
An amazing experience. This is a childhood dream come true in a very elegant and geek-friendly way. You really live the race, and your tactical (gear choice) and strategical (where and when to risk your tires etc) choices along with some necessary luck keep you on your toes.

It's a great game that however requires time and people. Yes it's playable with fewer than 5 players and you can play for fewer than 3 rounds and without the qualifications, but you lose some of the experience. To get the full out of the box, you need 5 people and 5 hours per race. Add to that the fact that racing games cry for tournaments and you get the idea..

To sum it up, Formula D is a thrilling game but you need to commit to it.

Formula D strikes a great balance between ease of play and strategic decision making.  The whole affair is very well put together, and it keeps everyone involved.

I really enjoy the subtle rules touches that make this game great,and see myself playing it for a looong time to come.

My 8 year old loves this game; the concepts are very easy to latch onto.

**Update 12/26/09 - After playing Rush N' Crush, I have to drop this to a 7.  Given the choice between cruising a race track with or without machine guns, I know what my choice is going to be.

**Update 11/10/2013 - Played a 10-man game over the weekend and it totally re-kindled my love of this game.  Moving it back to an 8.  The risk/reward mechanic with the gears and dice rolling is just perfect.  Any multi-lap race becomes an awesome struggle with perfect ebb and flow.

I played the street track, and was not too impressed.  I didn't like the player's special abilities, found they scewed play too much, one player got the ability that prevented him from skidding 3 spaces on corners, and of course rolled for rain! Nobody had a possible chance to beat his player from the start.  I like the simplicity of Formula De and the basic REAL race tracks for that game.  I'll probably resort to the original most often.

I don't know quite what to say about this, except that I think it may be more interesting than it is fun.

I really like the gear system and the non-standard numbered dice that go with it.  It just seems to take so long for the number of non-obvious decisions you actually make, and it's so easy to get totally hosed if you just barely miss getting into a curve.

That said, it is definitely fun when you hit the curves just right and fly past your opponents

A great light racing game. We play this all the time....lots of fun...easy to learn and teach.....you can almost smell the rubber burning off of the tires.

Fun, entertaining, push your luck game. I've always enjoyed Formula 1 and track design, so the theme of this game is a big plus for me. I could see it getting a little long the more players you add, but so far it's been fun with 2 and 3 players.

Update: Ran a little long with 5 players. Still a lot of fun though.

Love the dice.  The board is cool.  I haven't played the advanced game, so that may be keeping the score down.  A big hit with the kids- but we allow you to shift through as many gears as you want each turn.

I can't imagine playing a two-lap game unless you dedicate an entire evening game session to doing so.  The roll-and-move mechanic is both interesting and novel and the tactical complexity is balanced nicely by the push your luck element the dice introduce.  The tracks just seem to be really long, and I'm  not interested in playing a 2-3 hour racing game.

This game wasn't even on my radar screen until I saw a DiceTower review....it's not the type of game I would typically expect me to like...Heck! I'm not even a racing fan, but there's just something about it that keeps drawing me in.  The bits are FANTASTIC!   Wish there was a way to speed the game up, but even still I can't wait to get behind the wheel again....  
I feel the need!...the need for SPEED!!!!

I surprisingly liked this much more than I thought.  In fact, everyone in my gaming group had that same thought.

Had a mix of people, non-gamers, hardcore Role-playing players.  Everyone had a lot of fun.  There wasn't much contention, which is probably my only big complaint, otherwise it was a great, fun, dice-rolling time! 

On subsequent plays, the game fell a little flat, it feels a bit forced like you have to make your own excitement, almost forcibly rally people up so they get into it, otherwise it can just feel like, "oh it's my turn? Okay I'll chuck this die and then get back to facebook on my phone."

So how much it engages people is player specific.  Stil enjoy it as an easy game to bring in new gamers.

RATING: 6
Almost identical to its older sibling, [gameid=173], but this one has slightly better components.  The basic mechanics here, as in the older title, are solid.  The idea of managing which gear you're in so that you can take the turns well works very well, and gives the game a surprising amount of strategic depth.  The problem, just as with the old one, is that the game has a tendency to run long, and to have a runaway leader.  There's a big benefit to being out front, as the track is clearer and there is little chance of running into the other players.   If you play, do just one, or at most, two laps.  That'll leave people hungry for more.

Egy regi klasszikus ujaertelmezese, az autoverseny tema alapja! Sok palya elerheto, de mar az alapbodozzal is lehetunk utcai vaganyok a rendorok elol is futva, vagy F1-es profik Monacoban. 10jatekosig, akar 5 csapatban... es a 30 oldalu kocka, ahogy felkapcsolsz 6-ikba... Whrummmmm 
Létezik alap és haladó szabályrendszer is. A haladó tanítása nem túl egyszerű, bár kétség kívül reálisabb a játékélmény. Az alapverzióban ellenben minden autónak 18 kvázi "hibapontja" van, és ezek fogynak ha nem állsz meg a kanyarban, koccansz, vagy vészfékezel pl. Na hát sokan stratégiai megfontolásból fékezés nélkül száguldanak át a sikánon, mert még pont belefér a hibapontba... ami persze szabályos megmozdulás, csak annyira nem tematikus, hogy az én játékélményemet is rontja (háziszabállyal korrigáljuk).

WOW!  I love this game!  It has a unique playing style that you shift gears up or down and your die size increases or decrease with your gear changes.  It really takes some strategy and thinking, but once you get the hang of it, it can be GREAT fun!  I love using nitro on the last lap and having my car explode... *sarcasm*...

Great fun with the kids; rolling and moving quickly is the key here. (Yes, you could optimize every possible situation, but that sucks the life out of it quickly.) It is laugh-inducing once you realize that you should SPEND those wear points on risky moves, and that if you have more than a few left at the end you missed some great opportunities.

GRAND PRIX: This is essentially the same game as Formula De, with a few little changes made to the rules to make it somewhat different.  Granted, the game gives a lot of expansion to the previous game by using the street racing rules, but if you wanted Formula De and missed out, then you can use this game as a substitute.  For people who already own it, then the new game gives you a new map to play around with.  Unfortunately for me, the game isn't different enough to offer something that makes the game something I want to keep and play; like Formula De, it's a fun game with some interesting choices to make, but the time it takes to make a single lap makes the game too long for me to want to play. People who liked the first one, though, will likely like this one, as well.

Jogo de corrida muito divertido!

Cada jogador tem um carro, e um 'painel de controle', onde gerencia as marchas, o dano do carro e os turnos jogados.

No começo de cada turno, o jogadore pode manter, aumentar ou diminuir a marcha. Para cada uma, há um dado específico, que vai de X até Y número de casas possíveis. Por exemplo, na primeira marcha, o mínimo que se pode andar é 1 casa e o máximo são 2 (eu acho). Já na segunda marcha, vai de 4 a 8 (ou algo assim). O interessante é isso, não é só a sorte no dado que conta, o gerenciamento das marchas é bem importante, principalmente nas curvas.

Cada curva tem um número de paradas necessárias. Isso significa que o jogador tem que acabar aquele número de turnos dentro da curva, senão ocorrem penalidades. E para isso, o gerenciamento de marchas é muito importante. Às vezes, pode ser interessante tomar dano e não diminuir a marcha, mas dependendo do número de paradas, é necessário diminuir a velocidade do carro.

Bem fácil de entender, não há complexidade. Pelo menos no modo que eu joguei. Acho que há regras mais complexas, adicionando outros fatores. Ah, também tem a entrada nos boxes, mas não sei como é porque só jogamos uma volta.

Mas curti o jogo, foi bem divertido, pena que venham só duas pistas.

In a world without Formula D, fun 10-player board games would not exist.  We must be thankful we do not live in that world.  The experience is about as close to the real thing as you could imagine a dice-based board game being (yeah - not very close - but close enough).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Formula D transports you into the turbulent world of Formula 1: Don't lose control of the engine in the last bottleneck, master the chicane, stick to your opponent's back wheels, take advantage of the slipstream and then coolly overtake him... A Formula 1 pilot has to be willing to take risks and be able to plan ahead - at least if you want to get to the very top of the winners' podium.
\13\\13\
Formula D also means the suspense of illegal racing on the streets of the big cities. Anything goes: customized cars, nitro fuel injection, skidding in roundabouts, unfair tricks... The game principles always stay the same, but different cars, rules and circuits come into play.

This new edition of Formula D contains material which has not yet been published, including painted cars, dashboards, driver profiles, circuits... And simple playing instructions are enclosed, allowing you to start play immediately. Off you go!.

This is the new version of Formula De. It adds a nifty little plastic gear marker and damage tracker, some pre-painted cars and rules for driver special abilities and street racing. The F1 game is almost exactly the same and the old and new tracks are completely compatible with both versions of the game.

I like this one a lot, check out my Formula De comments for the reasons why!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Even as someone who generally hates dice, this one is pretty fun at first, and the theme makes it really accessible. It can run a little long if people don't count on their turn or over analyze, but the bigger problem is that it gets really stale after a small number of plays. I can understand why there are so many expansions and most of the fans prefer to treat it like a Formula 1 circuit - my third game on the map felt identical to the first, even with different people playing.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Formula De returns, only better!  The record-keeping has been reduced to moving markers on a peg-board; a huge improvement over needing a pencil and a crap-load of record forms.  The rule-book could have used a better editor, however; several rules are embedded within the pictures, making it harder to read than it should be.

I like the new street-racing, but it really needs a create-your-own character ability like the build-your-own car rule.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I love cars and auto racing so this was a natural fit for me.  Originally had Formula De and have a lot of the expansion maps/courses.  Fun game with pretty good simulation of speed in relation to gearing.  I like how you can customize you car for the specific race course.  There is strategy in your decision of what is the optimal gear to be in for a particular turn or section of track, and also when to use your cars "resources" like brakes, tires, etc.

For a game with such a cool gearing dynamic, it seems to drag on so long and wear it out so fast, yet I can't think of how it could be compressed in any way, as it needs the road-lengths it has to make dashes and braking interesting. Shame... I don't know what the solution to Formula D is.

Formula De was one of my original 10's when it came out.  As a car racing game it just hit all the right spots albeit the length of running 3 laps being too long.  Still, the "D" version has managed to improve on the original by adding preset cars and personalities as well as spice things up with some street racing.  More cars, player stat boards, and new track keep this game going like the energizer bunny.

Car racing simulation with card driven, point movement of cars around the track. The game incorporates every single detail of real formula car racing, passing, pits and tight turn squeezes.

This is a great game but my group needs a lighter version.

Meh, *if* everyone plays fast I could be persuaded to play again. Else I see no reason to waste time on this.

I actually prefer pitch car, even though I generally hate dexterity games. 

I sure hope I like Rush n Crush better!

[COLOR=#0000FF][b]Commentaires Personnel:[/b][/COLOR] J'ai pris beaucoup de temps avant de me mettre dans l'idée d'essayé ce jeu. Honte à moi, puisque j'aurais dépensé moins d'argent en tout ces jeux de courses inutiles que j'ai pris, comparativement à celui-ci! Pour moi, il entre dans mes favoris, et j'espère que mes amis l'apprécieront autant que moi.

[COLOR=#FF0000][b]Comments:[/b][/COLOR] It took me very long to get in the mood to try this game... What a shame! I could of saved a lot in buying many race games that didn't offered me pleasure for my money as much as this one did! A great success for me as I hope it will be for all of my friends.

Even better than the first edition because of the Street Racing possibilities and some new material: it is easier to know which speed are used and the damages on the vehicles.

Normally "Roll and Move" is a mechanic which you should run away from, but Formula D turns a rather dry mechanic on its head to create a rather fun game. 

Different shaped dice (d4, d6, d8, d12,d20, d30) become the gears that the players decide to shift up or down as they go around corners.  Going to fast into the corners, causes your car damage.   Good fun with meaningful decisions.

Another nice racing game. Lots of die rolls but there is some gambling and strategy involved with shifting. Car stats are added to the game which gives it another layer of options.

I'm not crazy about racing games. However, if you do like them this seems like the one to get.

Honestly this was a lot of fun to play with 6 people but I think I'd pass with any less than that. Playing 2 cars doesn't have the same level of chaos/competition as 6 people racing against each other.

Sold.

Random starting order. (Starting in pole position is amazing and has no discernable drawback.) Random chance to damage your car's body upon impact with other racers. Random chance to roll within the range of numbers you've projected that you need. Random chance another car's position doesn't muck up your course of action. Random chance a racer's power screws you over simply because it's convenient and inapplicable elsewhere. Random chance that your pit stop is blocked off and you're faced with the choice of skipping the tune-up (causing you to lose speed elsewhere) or deferring to the people who are already ahead of you and waiting your turn. (Which involves - ah yes - more loss of speed.) Then again, every game takes at least two hours. How's that for consistency?

House rule the Bad start out of the game because, how is that ever good or fair? If the dice gods hate you as they hate me, you will NEVER do well in this game. For being a racing game as it is, it's pretty good.

This new version of the old classic Formula Dé is absolutely great! The components make playing the game so much simpler, quicker, and more enjoyable - and that's saying something as the old version was quite good as well.

Formula D is [i]the[/i] motor sport game to own. If you even enjoy Formula 1 a little bit, you'll likely love this game. Formula D feels like driving, it simulates Formula 1 racing beautifully!

It is at its core a push-your-luck dice game, but it requires tactics and clever play. I highly recommend it.

Here's a list of old Formula Dé tracks that I still desire:

#19 Suzuka
#23 Monterey (Laguna Seca)
#17 Buenos-Aires
# 7 Magny-Cours
#10 Interlagos

They came in the following map sets:
19-20	Suzuka & Melbourne
17-18	Buenos-Aires & Barcelona
 7- 8	Magny-Cours & Monza
 9-10	Estoril & Interlagos
23-26	USA Track Pack #1

Excellent components and simple gameplay. A bit lacking in variety because it only comes with 2 tracks, and this is a major flaw for me. 
The game is also pretty 'samey' because the only decisions are shifting or moving in such a way that allows you to stop. Not much decision or complexity for a gamer to sink their teeth into.

Absolutely fantastic game that really brings the tension of high-speed motorsports to the gaming table. I particularly like the different layers of rules that I can build upon the basic rules to get people more and more used to the game. However, with having two different rulebooks (Basic and Advanced), referencing rules can be a bit tedious when there is an uncertainty.

How in the world is this ranked in the top 200???  It's heavily reliant on luck.  I played it once in a group of 8.  The pole sitter won the race and the people starting 5 through 8 finished - you guessed it - 5 through 8.  Starting position determined by a die roll.  Seeing dice typically make me ill and this game is no exception.

Wanted this game to be more strategic, but so much of it seems to be tied up with moments of strategic curves in between longer stretches of random dice rolling. Granted this game might warm up on me with more plays, but as it is, it's only okay.

Fun racing game. Not as conservative a racer as most people think.

Shame about the extremely poor examples, niggly little rules, and lack of clarity throughout the 'garbage' rulebook.

After all this time, there are still glaringly bad ambiguities about lane changes, braking etc, etc.

THE roll and move game - but that's what the game's all about. Encourages you to take risks by going up a gear in a desperate attempt to catch the leader when you really should be slowing down, and it just 'works'.

And with the drinking rules we invented, this game becomes a 10, no question about it.

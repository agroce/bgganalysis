Das Spiel ist mit seinen 3D Fliegern echt ansprechend und scheint auch eine Menge Spielmöglichkeiten zu bieten. Ich habe leider nur Stufe 1 ausprobiert, aber die war schon nett, da man dort 3 Züge im Vorraus planen muss. Ich bin mir aber nicht sicher, ob ich diese Version, oder die aus dem 2. Weltkrieg haben möchte ;-)

FunFunFUN. But be careful, who you play this game with. You can't avoid accidentally moving the planes 1-2mm every now and then, and you can't be 100% accurate with the manouvers. So Wings of War is definately not for people, who take gaming too seriously.

Too long. Elimination game. Too complicated/unclear rules even without additional rules. Be sure to have at least small table so there is some contact.

Great little game but also needs people into the theme. 

I love dogfights, but the game can be a bit too simple sometimes. The core mechanism is unique but the randomness of the damage deck can be frustrating in smaller battles.

Deluxe edition which comes with 4 miniatures included in the box and all components necessary for playing with four planes at the same time. German version.

1. Fokker DR. I	(Manfred von Richthofen) Germany
2. Spad XIII (Francesco Baracca) Italy
3. Sopwith Camel (William G. Barker) Great Britain
4. Albatros D.Va (Ernst Udet) Germany

I have always been lukewarm for Wings of War, as its fiddly and draining side - however limited - still overweights what little delight playing it gives: yet I have fond memories of it as its been one of the very first games I’ve played as I came back to boardgaming, several years ago. [i](September 2011)[/i]

[b]Update[/b] - If given the chance, I wouldn’t play Wings of War gladly: thus during my Fall 2015 rating revise I lowered my rating from 6 to 5, no matter how fond my memories.

This game just looks fantastic. The miniatures really top the game off for me. The rules are available online too, which is handy as they're in German in my box since this has not been released in English.
 
The four miniatures in this game are all aircraft types that you will find in the Famous Aces box. Buying this version of the game gets you Famous Aces in 3D. The only thing missing is a few extra aircraft cards.

Great light game very fast and easy to teach a new player to play.  The miniatures really make the game.  Some people play it and start wanting to add lots of chrome but in my opinion the game is best as it is out of the box.  Enjoy it for what it is.  Fast fun with cool minis that make you want to make lots of sound effects as you open up on the other player!

RATING: 6
Miniatures in this set tre really awsome and I don't have anything against the game either. Basic rules are rather simple but easy to teach to anyone and complexity rises when additional rules are introduced. Game is at is best with all rules included and with as many planes as possible.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
I give this a full half a point more than it's card based counterpart not because of the altitude rules, but solely on the miniatures, which are a heck of a lot of fun to play with!  Plus they are really very well done!

I started playing Mustangs and Messerschmitts years ago, and about that same time I was introduced to Fighter pilot and other air to air games.  At the time I thought they were the best games out there...  Then along came Wings of War WW1 and then later WW2 by Nexus games.  Andrea Angiolino and his partner devised and put together an air war game like no other.  After playing it a couple times, I found the rules system simple and easy to learn.  All I needed to do was develop the "Eye" for figuring out where the airplane will end up when I plot it's movement.  That comes with experience.  Overall this is a very easy game to learn and play.  I love the pre-painted aircraft for the game, but sometimes I just cannot help myself and either repaint one or get an alternate source of aircraft and then paint it myself.  That is the model hobbyist in me.

Players play out World War I dogfights, with miniatures and maneuver cards.  Stunningly beautiful boxed package, designed as a started set for the Wings of War miniatures series.  Four miniatures (Albatros, Spad, Camel, Dr.1), damage and aircraft decks, stands, marker counters all included.  The standard miniatures rules for the series apply.  Nothing really new apart from the new miniatures design, but good to have a "all in one" everything you need box available in English.  Excellent job.

Played first two games of this today (11-19-2011).  Game #1:  Me (Red Baron) vs. Mr. Billington (Sopwith Camel), and he won.  Game #2:  Me (Red Baron and Albatross) vs. Mr. Billington (Sopwith Camel), and I won.  Fun game.  It was easier to play using the plane cards rather than the miniature-planes-on-plastic-bases.  Would like to play it again, but with the game mats instead (and maybe trying to use the miniatures again).  Watching the how-to-play video months ago certainly helped a great deal.  The rules on their own aren't as clearly written.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This game achieves its complete potential with the miniatures and a game mat. Very fun and short intense games. The worst part is if a player (or more) is downed soon in the game, he'll have a boring time until the rest finishes the game.

Nice mechanics in this game. Best played with two players, four goes as well. At times the games seem to last forever, if players predict the movement of others totally wrong. To avoid this, I suggest to try to play it card by card, having the previous two moves unavailable and visible on player board at all times. It also makes the game feel a bit more fluent. All in all a great variation to have in a boardgame collection.

Simple little flight simulation based on WWII planes. The deluxe edition comes with some nice painted models and looks real pretty. The game itself is fairly simple and straightforward. I was kinda looking for something with a little more depth. I do like that fact that each plane has its own quirks, but the whole game revolves around manuevering your planes and can get kinda boring towards the end.

RATING: 6
Beautiful boxed set, with exquisite, sturdy, nicely painted miniatures. This game looks very cool. The gameplay however is very dull in its basic format (2 player dogfight with simple rules). My second game felt pretty underwhelming. I think with 4 players and by trying out some of the special rules (bombing runs, climbing and descending) you add a lot of spice to this game. The mechanics are essentially very repetitive and the outcomes can be fairly random with a lucky pot shot taking down a plane. Excellent for expansion and by putting a bit of time in to building backgrounds and challenging choice-full scenarios a potentially thrilling game.

The level of customization is a bit overwhelming at first.  You have many different planes with their own stats and manoeuver decks ( some radically different, others just slightly), you can add special rules, campain rules, and there is many scenarios (dog fight, escort, bombers, balloon busters, hitting ground targets, etc..)

It is really a cool game, with enough depth to keep your brain going, but enough luck to keep short and replayable.  I need/want more plays of this.

Thought that this one might be the miniatures game for me. No painting at least and you only need 1 model to play instead of an army. Simple rules. I just found that it seems like people just fly around and sometimes you get lucky and have a shot. Plus I didn't like the planes having their bases overlapped. And it was difficult to do precise movements exactly right because when I slid the card out it would always seem to move the plane a bit.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Very cool! Wings of War has always been on my list of games to try and now with the new Deluxe set (which I translated and thus got a copy without any effort from my part) it's very attractive indeed. Our first two fights were great fun, even though I flew off the table in the second one... Darn, though I was already heading away from the combat with a broken plane that couldn't turn left. 

Indifferent.

RATING: 6.5
This one has the miniatures and it's quite impressive to first time players. It gets pretty dull after a game or two though and it almost never hits the table. I think each player should be able to control 2 planes to coordinate attacks to make it more strategic rather than just flying around hoping to pull a damage card. I've only been playing it 2 players but maybe more people would make challenging.

Rated it a little higher now that I have the Solitaire pilot rules hammered out. Good fighting!

House rule #1: For each straight/level card played, may remove 1 jammed gun counter.
House rule #2: A second jammed rudder damage card of the same direction makes it permanent damage.
House rule #3: Plane cannot fire on higher targets on turn it dives, or lower targets when climbing.
House rule #4: You can tail when the ruler can touch any part of the front of your stand and contacts any part of the targets back of stand. (Half ruler if at 1 altitude difference...) You can swap a stall for a climb and a straight for a dive if the plane you are tailing changes altitude on you.

RATING: 8
Exellent game which always seems to be fun for everyone involved. Has stolen the whole gaming night a few times with series of rematches. Best to have 4 or more players, but works ok with 3 when playing something like recon or bombing scenario. Although extra plane with rear gunner is then good thing to have. Don't really like to fly more than 1 plane per player, so I'd rather play something else if only 2 players around.

Downgraded from 9 to 8 simply because Sails of Glory is prefered game with this mechanic for me.

Geniale! Mi ha attirato per le miniature e sono rimasto colpito dall'immediatezza. Gioco di simulazione aerea ambientato nella Prima Guerra Mondiale, con una meccanica estremamente versatile, adattabile a qualunque esigenza (da semplicissimo a molto simulativo, da fortunoso a strategico, da 2 a infiniti giocatori). Con pochissime regolette riesce a trasmettere la sensazione di pilotare aerei così bene che non puoi fare a meno di fare il verso del motore ad ogni carta che scopri! Fermo restando che è necessario utilizzare almeno 4 aerei per divertirsi sul serio e richiede molto spazio per giocare (almeno un grosso tavolo). Splendide miniature e ottimi i mazzi manovra che rispecchiano piuttosto fedelmente le caratteristiche degli aerei reali. Questi maledetti aeroplani danno dipendenza! Divertimento… divertimento! Questo gioco ne possiede moltissimo. Intrigante, affascinante, semplice, veloce e longevo. Un gioco che non può mancare in una ludoteca e se vi stancate di giocarci, vi restano comunque quattro bellissimi aeroplanini, perfettamente riprodotti. Godibili e ben fatti anche i "booster" contenenti un aereo addizionale più il suo mazzo di carte movimento. Inevitabile cedere alla tentazione di accrescere la vostra flotta aerea, collezionandoli tutti! Un capolavoro Made in Italy!

This is a great value--especially for new Wings of War players... you get four planes and all the rules, damage cards, and range markers... the game with minatures is a close to perfect--this set is great and may start you down the path to addiction... of course, for those of us who already have the base rules and expansions, this set means four more planes with unique paint schemes...

The model planes are marvelous and on constant display.
I was keen on getting all the models, but they don't come cheap, and you don't need them all to enjoy the game.

Really enjoy the game, but the miniatures are not only expensive but also hard to get.
Pitty I really would have liked to fill my table with more.

Had some fun playing the game, quite enjoyable, but th ink it will be less fun without the miniatures.

RATING: 6.5
Juego de programación de movimientos. Las reglas completas con todos los detalles son demasiado infumables en la practica... Este tipo de juegos no debe buscar ser una simulación, sino una abstracción, algo simple y dinámico.
Su mayor fallo, el sistema de combate por mazos, demasiados 0 o daños críticos desproporcionados... Mejor el X-Wing.

RATING: N/A
I haven't really known what to make of this since I first played it. I've had a thing for aircraft and especially arcade fighter games - not simulators - for as long as I can remember and figured this might scratch that itch. I went for WW1 instead of WW2 because the gameplay seemed to be more chaotic and over all move faster. I also read soem important comments about how planning one move at a time tended to kill tabletalk.

Alas, I can't get over feeling a little meh about WoW. The first niggles I had with the execution, and with X-Wing on the market now I can see what I missed in WoW. There is a better way of handling maneuver selection and execution, and that's been pulled off in X-Wing. The second thing I disliked was that there's not much variety in the four base set planes. What you need to do to give this game wings is get an arsenal of aircraft and run scenarios. The first of those two considerations irks me the same as any CCG/LCG does. Add to that the confusing publishing model (you need this for the plane and maneuver deck and then this other thing for the damage deck) and the fact that many planes differ only subtly.

There are great moments to be had and the game is very imaginable. I will fondly remember planes exploding all of a sudden. But there's no denying that this isn't what I wanted it to be - it's much more a sim than an arcade game.

Gorgeous minis, fast and functional rules. Love the theme. Perfect for the jaded miniature painter who can't bother to build yet another army for a game you never know how much you'll get to play.

Built my own battleboard, Google Earth style, with buildings the height of plasticard thickness and mountains 3-4 layers high, so plane bases lie more or less flat. Paint + flock (for woods and crop fields). Quick and easy!

Just the right amount of tension, randomness and WWI mini-planes. Based on two plays, which were very cool and exciting. Making flight noises and MG impressions adds flavour.

RATING: 7
I've just played for the first time. It's a great game to just dive into as the rules are simple and the models give you a great excuse to make really bad plane noises - they do add to the game atmosphere considerably.

The scope for causing trouble and mayhem is excellent as you turn your guns on your own flying partner for refusing to acknowledge that you do in fact "own the sky".

I'm buying!

The deluxe set is just perfect. I wasn't really that taken with Wings until the miniatures came along (yeah, I'm your classical eye candy whore). The rules are simple, exiting and there are a lot of little things that make this feel like true gentlemenly air combat of WW1.

The box content provides great value for the price.

I have an additional Fokker Dr.1 and Rickenbacker (Spad XIII), so it can be played with up to 6 people. A friend of mine has yet another two planes, and we enjoy playing it with 4 people 2 planes each.

RATING: 5
A perfectly themed outmaneuvering light (war?)game. 

Despite the absense of a board, the minatures make the game look fantastic in play. Gameplay is also fast, is based on reading your opponent(s) which I absolutely love and creates a very good "dogfighting" narrative. The rules can be gradually introduced which helps new players, while the scenarios add much to replayability. Damage control is also excellent in making every dogfight a unique one.

The simple encounter scenario (or the basic pure dogfight) can be a little frustrating as you have little information to read your opponent, and as a result the session may drag too long. Other scenarios are much better for me, bombing being the best. The explosion damage while thematic, is a bit too cheap in practice and imo should be excluded. There is luck in the game, but removing the explosion hits makes things much better.

All in all the game is very pretty and enjoyable. 

Update: Having played X-Wing, I have to admit WoW feels very outdated compared to it, slower and less tense. I've lost most will to play it again, and the only thing that half saves it is the theme.

Love dogfight games and this resembles those well from a maneuvering point of view even if I am missing more of the rules, similar to performing the immelmann, that would require certain moves to be done before performing special moves. The card driven damage system is just as random as dice driven systems. The major problem which keeps X-wing as the better dogfight miniatures game is the extreme fiddlyness with the cards as moving templates. The upside with the cards as templates is that the airplanes can have completely different maneuvers.

Finally got my hands on this set as well as some extra planes.  Opted for this over X-wing in memory of my Grandpa who's love for planes is one of the things I knew best about him.

For years he volunteered at the Museum of Flight in Seattle, WA.  I loved watching his eye's light up as we would walk by the WWI planes and he would stop to tell us all the details on each one.

This game for me is fun filled with emotion.

[7-14] Really love this but dropped rating a bit since it rarely hits the table.

Also, I have the Wings of Glory WW1 Rule Set/tokens as well.

The basic rules fill only a few pages of the handbook. They are very easy to learn and the game is fast to play. There must be something to counter that tendency to circle around the enemy endlessly with no hope to make any damage, but maybe the key is in building some distance between the oponent's plane and mine.

Plotted movement at is best :)
Wings of War offers nothing to innovative but recycles the general idea of plotted movement from old games like Sopwith into a new and shiny concept. Of course the miniatures add a hugh toy-factor to the whole game and several small ideas (Altitude, Damage Deck) give the game a new flavour to distinguish it from the "old" games.
You could add a  1 to my vote if you are really into minitures (they are lovely) and another  1 to the vote if you like games like Sopwith, Robo Rally etc.

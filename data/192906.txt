Heir to the Pharaoh is my attempt to capture an "epic" feeling in an intense 2-player-only game that plays in an hour. It was a finalist in the Hippodice game design competition in Germany as "Ziggurat."

There aren't many good two-player games. This one looks exceptional on KS and it definitely deserves to be produced. A major publisher should pick it up, IMHO!

Solid game. 

Still only a couple of plays in, but there is always a lot to do, and the game feels pretty balanced. Points seem heavily dependent on who controls monuments, but I sense that with more experience, strategies will deepen. 

The auction system is fantastic, the theme is perfect, and the gameplay is smooth. Feels a little on the long side, but my wife and I are really enjoying our time with it. 

Looking forward to more plays, and hopefully upgrading my ranking.

Rules became clear after playing the 1st round, and they are relatively straightforward - aka nothing at all difficult here.
First half of each round, bid for 1 of 6 items;  second half of each round, use the (mainly placement) powers in order.
It's not exactly blind bidding, because each player starts with cards 1 - 10.  Used cards are given to the other player at the end of the round.  Using extra cards can affect the bidding in unexpected ways - such as making the lowest rather than the highest card win.
The game is then an abstract where points are awarded for relative placement (with a bit of set collection mixed in).
Those same two steps are repeated each round, but successive rounds are needed to 1/ allow the cards to move between players, and 2/  allow placements to build towards final scoring.  Regarding 1/, a player may for example play lower cards to sacrifice some losses to build a stronger hand in a following round.
The game is well done -- especially cool that it's for 2 players only -- and would rate higher if we had a stronger affinity for bidding games.

Heir to the pharaoh takes bidding/auction gaming to a sweet spot for two players. You have to be careful about what to bid and when because your opponent could get a stronger hand next turn if you bid too high on this one! The decisions you make because of the auctions make for a great strategy game that takes place on the board, while Magic cards can help you try to swing the favor of the gods your direction. I love that I can play this game with my eleven year old or my gaming friends, and it is an amazingly fun experience in any situation, I highly recommend this game if you like auction games and have room for a two player game with a great theme and a great strategic challenge!

Pretty splendid two player auction game. It's already splendid that a two player auction game works. HttP goes a lot further than merely working. All the decisions are tough since almost everything you do for your own good can set up your opponent for something even better in the future. Scoring is very multilayered and offers possibilities for both strategic and tactical approaches to the game. Suffers a bit from oversized box and badly edited rules.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

Nice production values and a solid two player game involving a bit of an auction. Cards used in auction will swap over to the other person at the end of the round. Each of the gods auctioned allow a certain action to be performed by the winner and one god is favored by the pharaoh and has a special modification to the action.

RATING: 6.5
Unique 2-player only game. The artwork is great. I love the Egyptian theme, and the dog and cat characters are charming. Nice overall production for both the retail and the Kickstarter editions. The KS edition has great wooden pieces in place of the cardboard tokens that come with the retail version. Game plays smoothly once you get through the first learning game to see how the bidding works for the god cards, and how scoring works for monuments placed on the main board. Interesting mechanic where you exchange used bidding cards with the other player each round, so keep that in mind when using high value cards.

I quite enjoyed my one play of this fun little two player game. The components are good and the theme is rather fun.

The key aspect of the game is bidding for the Favour of the Gods cards. These cards give the player that wins the bid the opportunity to utilise one of the variety of options to score points. 

After one play I am not unconvinced that there are too many ways to score (a points salad so to speak); this was true in my only game where I found myself losing the majority of the auctions but winning the game despite having significantly fewer scoring options. Then again, my opponent focused on placing and claiming the monuments on the board so perhaps that's not the optimal strategy.

Anyway, all good fun and one I'd play again but would be unlikely to purchase.

[b]Heir to the Pharoah[/b]

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (8 -> 8)[/COLOR]

[i]My older daughter and I have continued to enjoy further plays of Heir to the Pharaoh. Once you play a few times there is an interesting meta game that develops, especially in regards to how you play your bidding cards. The actions you take are relatively straight forward making the bidding rounds the most strategic part of the game. As you rounds go by it becomes more apparent what gods you'll want to bid on but the animal magic cards add an extra bluffing mechanic so even if your opponent knows what you want an animal magic card can change the outcome of an auction. OF course they can do the same thing which creates for some tense moments during the auction phase. After that you carry out your actions and then start a new round of bidding. 

I was lucky enough to get a KS copy which has the beautiful wooden components; this game looks great set up on the table. Heir to the Pharaoh is another hit for Alf Seegert, who is one of my favorite designers. I'd definitely recommend not only checking out this game, but also some of his other designs [i]([thing=147431][/thing] and [thing=163056][/thing] being my favorites)[/i].[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]I'm not a huge KS backer, in fact I think all the games I've backed have been small card games except for this. I backed this because I am a huge fan of Alf Seegert's games (with Cubist and Musée being the stand outs for me). On to the game itself... 

- After reading through the rules I'll admit they weren't as intuitive as some of Alf's other games, but once you start playing a few rounds everything comes together. 
- Finally an excellent 2p bidding mechanic! After each round you exchange the cards you used to bid that round with your opponent (feel free to use all your high cards, but next round you might not have many high cards to secure the bids you really want).
- Animal magic cards add another layer of strategic play during the bidding phase.
- Nice mix of in game and end game scoring, I wish thee was a player aid to remind you what to score in game but thankfully you can figure out your in game points at any time (which you may want to do for your first couple of plays to make sure you didn't forget anything).
- My favorite part of the game is trying to maximize the monument placement, it is a fun spacial puzzle made even more difficult because you bid separately to place the monument and claim the monument which lets you also face the tile in the direction you want.
- Top notch production and beautiful artwork. Eagle Gryphon knocked it out of the park with this one.

I've already played this twice more in September and I am actually enjoying further plays even more now that we have a good grasp on all the possible ways to score and potentially disrupt your opponent.[/i]

1.競標階段 每人暗出一張牌然後一起打開，數值高的拿走目前的神卡(平手有太陽的贏)，然後開下一張繼續競標，出的牌放面前疊起數字要露出來，最後一張神卡直接給標到神卡較少的玩家
*如果有人有魔法卡時可在每輪競標前決定是否要出，最多一張，在競標牌都跟魔法牌都蓋著出完之後，先開魔法卡結算，數字一樣就一起失效，否則小的先啟動，用完的開著棄到牌庫底
*法老卡開時直接移到圖板旁，每個玩家暗出一張牌之後結束，如果是第一張卡，法老標記放到下張神卡上
2.行動階段  標到的神卡照數字小到大一個一個結算，有法老標記的能力會強化
1. 放該回合的建物立牌到場上，下面放建物標記，放到魔法標記上時移除該標記抽一張魔法卡，建物立牌彼此距離兩格以上(包括金字塔)，有法老標記時則無視此規則(沒合法位置時也無視此規則)
2.將此回合放的建物標記翻到擁有此神玩家那面，並且可以決定上面箭頭的指向，有法老標記的話可以移動一格(可對角)，踩到魔法標記也移除抽卡
3.抽走啟動的建築卡並馬上拿分，同種類的第1/2/3/4張拿1/3/5/7分，有法老的話可改選旁邊兩張或蓋著的抽一張，擺到圖板的立牌也會馬上更換
4.放一個你的標記在目前太陽標記在的位置馬上拿一分，法老標記的話放*2那面，並拿兩分
5.抽一張自己的魔法卡，如果抽完蓋著的洗勻在抽，有法老則抽三選一，剩下的開的放牌庫底，最後一輪此行動改為拿兩分
6.法老 確認太陽標記，如果在四個角落則直接計分，打開所有蓋著的競標卡，總值高的拿目前太陽標記所在位置的分數(平手在暗標一次且不能出魔法卡)，同時放一個目前最大的金字塔基座在圖板基座位置，之後競標卡移到他的已出卡區，如果沒計分則每人蓋一張結束
7.把此回合用掉的所有競標卡給對手，太陽順時針移動一格(到起始遊戲結束)，選擇一張新的主動建物卡(兩張開著的或抽蓋著的一張)，並馬上補，然後放上建物標記跟對應立牌，把所有神卡(7以外)洗勻蓋著，7放底，開第一張並放法老標記，回到新回合
*遊戲最後計分
>手上魔法卡一張一分
>太陽軌有你標記最常那條，每個標記兩分，如果是翻面的則4分
>金字塔貢獻最多的7分，平手看最上面那塊
>每個建物根據建物標記的箭頭方向，該方向所有的建物計分，分數為立牌上格數，如果只到金字塔則計自己的立牌分，計完分把標記移除
*平手比建物卡數目

Picked this up in a trade and it is only 2p! I didn't realize that, definitely cool. I really loved this game. I love the bidding mechanic it has and very clever to hand the cards you used in the round to the other player. I liked it a lot, unfortunately, Ron did not. But, I am sure I will make play it again sometime. :)

There is a pretty steep learning curve to understand the first round. After that you will repeat the process and it becomes clear. There are some interesting decisions to build a strategy because you will constantly be giving the cards you play to your opponent. When you bid with a large card you let your opponent use it next turn!

There are a few things not explained by the rules.
It's fairly light. It's a tad long, but I enjoyed it.

Very unique 2 player only auction/bidding game. Seems like there is a lot of different scoring mechanisms at first, but they all gel together really well.

This is one of those games that gets better the more you play it. I was impressed from the start, but once we fully had the rules down the mind games during the auction started to shine through and the game only gets better from there.

It's just really unique, I can't compare it to anything else for only 2 players and I enjoy it more with each play.  Artwork and components are also great. Feel this one should get more attention.

Two player Eygyptian themed strategy and area control featuring head-to-head auction bidding to control the powers of the lesser gods between Bast and Anubis to become heir to the pharaoh.  Beautifully crafted visually with one of my favorite auction bid systems of bluffing and jockeying using identical sets of bid cards.  But then it goes further by switching the played bid cards at the end of each round---genius.  The escalating strategy of placing monuments, set collecting, and fighting for majority of building the pyramid and the added meta layer of claiming and playing animal magic cards makes this one of my favorite two player games.

Heir to the Pharaoh was a Christmas present from Tyler. We played it for the first time the day after Christmas and it immediately shot its way up to #3 New-to-Me Game for 2016, carelessly trampling and leaping over its contenders like the mangy dog and arrogant cat it is.

Heir to the Pharaoh is both coolly calculating as well as viciously cutthroat. I will probably never look at a bidding game the same way again, especially any game that attempts to do 2P bidding. While players start the game with (almost) identical decks which they use to bid with, at the end of each round the cards they used to bid are put into their opponent's hand, not returned to their own. So if you spent a round highballing every bid, you'll just handed your opponent a bunch of strong cards they get to use against you next round. Karma sucks like that. So half of the game is that bidding metagame where you're trying to get into your opponent's head. What you're bidding on is 8 gods which allow you to do different actions. This is the other half of the game, and it's a series of abstract mini-games. You're trying to point arrows to or through structures to score points, place a disc on a track where you get points for the longest unbroken sequence you can make on this track, and build a pyramid (the person who builds the most tiers gets the points). There's also a god that lets you draw from a personal deck of powers which you can add during the bidding phase. This basically just screws with your opponents plans in one way or another (they can also backfire, though).

It all comes together into a brilliant, brutal, and extremely innovative package. I'm also extremely fond of the unique art style. I can't wait to play is much more in the coming year.

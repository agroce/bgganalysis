Specific review of the "Last Rites" differences to other VotK games:

Let's start with the good. Last Rites has some really interesting Purple (Unique) cards and a really solid set of starter cards. It also tries to take the game in an interesting direction whereby the boneyard is used more often than in previous iterations, allowing more room to combo or screw up and give the opponent something nice.

The bad for Last Rites:
-Borders are darker and less vibrant than other VotK.
-Many of the card effects are more complicated which can cause reading/calculation fatigue.
-A few more "Gotcha!" mechanics than Afterlife, though less than the original.
-Complicated chains of effects from areas in the game that change frequently causes these chains to be basically pure luck and zero planning/anticipation/skill for the most part. You don't take opportunities (since you can't plan for every boneyard configuration that might change, or pyramid crumble direction), you're basically handed them or you're not.
-Early game buys don't ramp economy very well and force you to grind for a longer time
-The EXTREMELY bone-headed idea of having an Ivory (Max-8) set in the game. I have no idea how they thought this was okay. It completely ruins the game and forces every player to try and max it, meaning no one can, causing a Prisoner's Dilemma.

Not the best version I've played.

Part of the review that's generic for all Valley of the Kings games:
While this is probably the best VotK game, all of these games share some serious problems (sans the Pink set problem for Last Rites). Firstly, the good of VotK games:
-Easy to teach
-Satisfying to collect sets
-Great art
-Cool pyramid conveyor idea that makes your buys affect the opponent even more
-Neat scoring system (which has some problems)
-Egyptian history is (mostly) accurate
-Nice linen box

Bad things
-Greycore card stock that's thin and floppy. The linen and coating is nice but I'm so tired of card games getting a pass on shit-core cards just because you sleeve them.

-Inanely luck-driven. Moreso than other deckbuilders like Star Realms and Dominion. Mostly this is because many of the card effects work off of specific configuration (of the Pyramid/Hand/Tomb/Discard/Deck/Stock/Boneyard/Opponent) and if those configurations change even a tiny bit, you can easily be screwed out of a LOT of points (see: scoring problems). Something as simple as one bottomdeck in one turn can cost you 10% or more of your ending points.

-Scoring doesn't work like you want it to. It feels innovative until you realize that half-assing a Max-7 set is strictly better than completing a Max-4 set. Obviously, you want to max that 7, then work down the list (6, 5, etc) but you probably will never leave double digit scoring in a 4 player game. In a 2 player game, it's nearly impossible to stop you unless the opponent blocking your set also doesn't block their own set (which is both rare and luck based). Having scoring be based on squares means that the gap between each set color is +2 the GAP of the previous color: (9, 16 in the other sets) 25, 36, 49, 64 in Last Rites. So starting the Max-5 set is strictly better than the Max-4 set even if you never get the last card, since you can generally achieve it just as easily (or easier, See: Set problems)

-Set problem logic. Pink set is worthless. As the above criticism points out, there's no real case when Pink (Max-3) is better to attempt to start than Brown (Max-4). In fact, I typically get more points just scoring my Uniques which have static VP values. They can work in a 4 player game if there's heavy denial going around but completely fail in a 2P game. Also there's a huge problem with the LOGIC of the squared scoring on sets that have lower counts. It seems to make sense until you realize something...

...Low-numbered sets are HARDER to complete than middle sets such as Orange (Max-5) and Green (Max-6). This is because they are less frequently available. That means you're more likely to be able to buy and score 4 Blue (Max-7) or White (Max-8, last rites) than all four Browns. Having less of them means you have less room for failure, either due to the opponent(s) meddling or you simply failing to make numbers. Granted, the larger sets also have higher costs on the back half, you also tend to automatically ramp economy as you play though. In my extensive testing, it's equally hard to complete the Pink set (Max 3) as the Blue set (Max 7). The Green (Max 6) set seems to be the easiest difficulty-to-score value, being worth at most 36 points but having 1 card of wiggle room to miss. Again though, your job is just to pinpoint the highest max color and always buy uniques of it as much as possible, only denying an opponent when it would also benefit you. That strategy has led to a win every single game. Sometimes by only 2 points and sometimes by 36!

-VotK games are games of extreme calculation. It's actually incredibly annoying if you weren't looking for a Euro game in such a small package. I'm not sure who that's for: Euro gamers don't like the off-the-charts amount of randomness that totally fucks your gameplan and Ameritrash players don't enjoy re-calculating multiple stack levels of cause and effect chains as well as scoring implications every single time an opponent changes any aspect of the game ever. It also means there's a huge amount of analysis paralysis, especially as the game goes on even if you're a veteran, since no pyramid is universally solved. If you play this game without considering every possibility as soon as your turn starts (for something will always change, forcing recalculation) or you just "go with your gut" you will lose every game, by a considerable amount of VP.

-Like all VP games, has backwards winner determination where the winner is just whomever has the most points. In this game, winning by 1-2 VP feels like absolutely nothing. These sorts of games should make a tiered scoring system similar to Roll Player which helps players understand how well they're doing from game to game, fostering mastery and good sportsmanship.

OVERALL: I would say VotK: Last Rites is worth owning if you really liked Afterlife and want some variety in your VotK library.

RATING: 9
Very powerful new cards. Entombing + taking cards, multiple entombs, and major boneyard manipulation. Includes cards that reward you for keeping a larger deck, and provides mechanics for culling a big deck late. Will definitely be fun to combine with the other sets, I think this is probably the most refined release though.

:thumbsup: [b]POSITIVE POINTS:[/b]

++ Nice compact deck-building game, that have players interaction and that have an interesting twist in thinning the deck to score the cards (entombing).
++ The theme is well integrated with the mechanisms and the the setup (although this time, you are recruiting people that will help build your tomb and thus you are not really "entombing" them, like we were with the object of the first two games).
++ There is a really nice sense of escalation, the first few rounds doing not much and only buying one card at a time, but, by the end of the game, we can completely take out almost every cards from the pyramid doing awesome combos, and entombing a lot of cards for a lot of points.
++ The most different from the previous two games (and the heaviest too): same mechanisms so you don't have to learn a new game rules, but cards ability are surprisingly different and more complex (more text and a lot of alternate actions) thus you must play differently. This version encourage having a bigger deck and thus a bigger discard piles. The game flow is more like a snowball going down a hill, getting much larger hand and going much faster as the game progress.
++ Easy to teach (but less then the first two since the actions are more complex), ultra-fast to set-up and fast to play (but a bit less than the first two as since the action are more complex, and a lot of cards make you draw more, you have more choices to evaluate and this may lead to some AP).
++ A third game from the Valley of the Kings series that I love which will add even more variability when combining sets.
++ The first game to change a bit more the format with new starter cards, a 8 cards set and no 3 and 4 cards set (and 2 less uniques card to keep the card count the same).


:thumbsdown: [b]NEGATIVE POINTS:[/b]

-- The first few games are rather long (60-75 min.) to get used to the card abilities which are more complexe than the first 2 games, and this can make some new player back off from this game.
-- The replayability of a single VotK game is lower when played at the 2 players count and always against the same opponent (as it is my case) as part of the variability is how the players play the game and what strategy they try.
-- Since the action are more complex, and also because several cards make you draw more, you have much more choices to evaluate, and this lead to more AP and downtime.
-- There is a lot more text to read on the cards of this game, compare to the first 2.

AKA Valley of the Kings 3rd edition.  Either the system ran out of steam with Afterlife or really this was all originally intended to be one much larger game incorporating all, but the publisher split it up into 3 mini games. 

I liked that the starter cards are different, and that does change a little, but perhaps I'd have preferred a pure expansion-only set (as I'm never going to play this 5 player).  I'm also begining to suspect whether the system has reached the limits of its potential. Perhaps a co-designer or new develeoper could be brought in and find a way to take the system forward as this really was (to me), just more cards and lacks the innovation that the Dominion expansions have usually always had. 
H'mmm.. yeah, this is a take-it or leave-it for me dependent on your gaming budget and free shelf space.

RATING: 8
Hands down, my favourite iteration of "Valley of the Kings".  The first set captured all the essentials of the game and the "Afterlife" set added more variety and multiple player effects while still keeping things straightforward.  "Last Rites" adds a serious amount of player interaction and multiple game effects to almost every card. This makes the game a little slower and a lot more to consider, but it's so well designed that it is a treat to really think out your turn and intuit the ramifications.  While things might feel a bit trudge-y at the beginning, the game flows as players get into it.  I really do like this at 2 players, especially considering how much more is going on now (that is: exact same game, no extra rules, just extra weight).  3 players might be nice as well, though this would be too slow of a slow game with 4 unless everyone is well familiar.  I also think I'm ready to mix the sets together now, to get the best of all worlds.

Still, if you're going to buy only one set of Valley of the Kings, get "Last Rites". It really is the most considered of all of them and Tom Cleaver has done an excellent job here!  So glad AEG still supports this great deck-builder line!

Good depth for its size.  Escalates nicely.  Very portable with low setup and table space requirements.  Can mix and match with other versions for more variety.  Some luck involved when revealing new cards.  Tactics can feel repetitive after many games.  Slows thing down by introducing cards that involve counting or searching through stacks.  "Afterlife" set is probably the best mix of depth and simplicity.

I love this game in general. I think Afterlife is still my favorite, but this has some nice stuff in it as well. I felt like we were comboing a lot with this game--adding a lot to the boneyard, but also managing to pull them right back out.
Compared to the 2 other version, this features a lot of cards that take cards either from the pyramid or from the boneyard, as well as a heavy dose of entomb effects.

A lot of card-combo in this one. I haven't decided yet whether it's too fiddly or with more plays will become amazing. I suspect the complexity overburdens things in much the same way that Cthulu Realms overburdened Star Realms and Intrigue overburdened Dominion. But I'm sure there are people out there who love complex card combos for whom this will be best. For me... it slows the game a little which takes a little steam out of why I like this series - the simple quick engine aspect ala Splendor / Star Realms / Dominion.

RATING: N/A
Sadly as much as I like the original, there is a theme disconnect with Last Rites: I'm entombing people here, not objects so there goes the narrative. From seeing the video review I'm thinking to at least get the sense of entombing that the people cards should be combined with the other sets; the people should not be entombed but kept in the personal deck to assist in the process especially in retrieving objects from the boneyard.

Like the other games in the Valley of the Kings series, this is a well thought-out variation on the deckbuilding mechanic where thinning your deck is a basic action you can take... and the only way you can score points. The rules are identical to the first two sets... so I'm pretty sure I'll enjoy it even though I haven't tried it yet.

Now, I've only played this four times at the time of writing, but so far I think this is a lot better than Dominion. In Dominion, most turns go by without any significant decision-making, you can basically make up a formula beforehand and stick to it.

Here, almost every hand you draw will present you with important strategic choices.

I realise it might get samey after 17 plays, just like Dominion did, but so far, I think this is the cleverer design.

If I could have only one deck builder, any one of this series of games would be it by a long shot.  I love each installment equally and would highly recommend them to any fan of the genre.  The entomb mechanic in these games allows one to "evolve" one's deck constantly, in order to adapt to the changing game state.  Brilliant.  Could be considered "mean" in terms of types of player interactions involved but, in my opinion, any "mean-ness" in the game is not just pasted on in order to create some form of interaction between players.  Instead, it is carefully considered and implemented, serving to enhance the depth of the game.  Gets better as one learns the cards and becomes familiar with the interactions/combos.  Hard to believe how much "good" is packed in such a small box.

This one is a little more nuanced than the other VotK sets. There are several abilities such as "draw x number of cards, give them to the other players in the order of your choice" that require you to make decisions based on the other players, instead of just getting the best card possible each turn.

This set has the potential to play faster than the others. Several card abilities remove cards from the pyramid or draw pile equal to the number of players, so a four-player game can end rather quickly.

I like it more than the base set because there aren't targeted attack cards, but Afterlife is still the best in the series for me.

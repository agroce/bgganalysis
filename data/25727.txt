A wonderful game in its artwork, rules, and excitement.  This is my first LnL game of the rules series.I bought it first, because the subject matter was different than most tactical historical and modern games; there was both an excellent book and movie to compare the lessons and challenges and see how they play out in a decent simulation.

First: When I opened the box when I got home, not only did I have beautiful components, but, to my surprise there was an autographed letter from Mark Walker thanking me for my purchase and providing me a direct phone line should I have any questions .  After I played my first games, I did have some situational rules questions.  I had an even greater surprise when I called Lock and Load to ask my questions, and they put me on directly with Mark (who was superb and who also emailed me answers).  That was a huge impression of customer service that I have gone on to buy more of his games.

My ratings:
Rules - 8;  The LnL rules system is what I like in squad level tactical game.  The rules are fast and the interactive/competitive dice rolling helps keep both players involved regardless of whose impulse it is.  Some of the rules regarding leaders and anti-armor weapon were vague to me. More importantly, what I like about these rules is that they are not bogged down in tedious minutae that other squad level games suffer.  The rules also, allow a player to try different scenarios to learn different rules aspects before tackling larger scenarios.

Artwork - 10.  The most beautiful board depiction of any game I have played!  Having spent time fighting in the cities of Iraq, I had flash backs just looking down on this board, it was like looking at a satellite photo.  The counters are also gorgeous and clear in their information and artwork.  

Scenarios - 8.  Although I have yet to play all scenarios, they are varied enough to get many plays out of them and I have been able to play the Pakistani Scenario, and Chalk 2's run to learn the infantry mechanics first, before tackling the Convoy and Helicopter heavy scenarios.  Each scenario allows a player to play out critical fights in the battle of the Black Sea/Mogadishu and understand the challenges facing both sides.

Playability - 9  be Fast paced mechanics, and clear player's aid cards make for scenario games that can definately be played from under an hour to a full day (allowing almost a real time refight of the battle).  One of my favorite aspects is how well the Somali psychology and tactics are portrayed with the road blocks and mobs rules, as well as the importance of RPGs,and the influence of the drug khat on the implacable courage of the Somalis.

Educational - 8. This game helped improve my understanding of the challenges faced in urban fighting, and the advantages/disadvantages both the Somalis and US forces had over each other.

Solitaire - 8.  This game does not require any hidden information to be enjoyable.  The US and the Somali sides have enough rule sets and flexibility to force a soltaire player to adapt to different tactics.

This is a great gateway game for getting other friends interested in wargames because of the popularity and knowledge many lay people know have of the battle of Mogadishu based on Black Hawk Down.

Also, I personally serve with veterans of that battle and have experienced many of the same hardships in battle.  I believe this portrayal in a game does honor those who fought it by helping others understand.

Nice maps.  Nice counters.  However, the rules fail to satisfy.  Not nearly a "light" game, but not crunchy enough for "heavy" game.  And doesn't feel right at all for a "medium" game.

I wanted more.

Mounted one-piece board, good thickness to the counters, looks very good.  I thought there was to be an AC-130 for what-ifs, but perhaps that will be a supplement in their new magazine.

An interesting game. The square map grid aside, it plays quite differently from the other games in the series. There is more emphasis on maneuver and melee combat, which makes for some dynamic, fluid challenges on both sides.

Picked this up due to the theme and that I could play it solo. So far disjointed rules have made playing the game more of a chore than fun. Gonna take a little while to get the rules down to overcome this. I'll try to remember to update my rating after more solo plays and a face to face game with Keith.

RATING: 7
I was quite shocked when i opened the box up. It's not to say that LNL games are sub par by any means but i was honestly surprised at the quality of the components. Counters are thicker cardstock than my three other LNL games, top quality upgrade. This is a bargain for the price, money very well spent. I know alot about this battle, i'm really happy to see the level of accuracy that has gone into the design of the game. Scenario's cover pretty much the full gamut of operations that occured and some what ifs? Truly wonderful effort. The map is beautiful and it's really emotive of what happened, nice and accurate, i couldn't ask for a better depiction. I have to give the map a big thumbs up in comparison to previous LNL maps, the hardboard mount and lack of bold hexlines (squarelines in this case) is really a step forward in my eyes. 
Overall it's a pretty unique game, must be the most polished view of modern squad tactics currently available. I'll update my score based on gameplay once i've tried all the scenarios.
My single gripe is just the icing on the cake of accuracy. I don't know the legal ramifications of having accurate names for leaders and units but it would have been a nice touch. I'd like to have seen one extra AH-6 counter and a para rescue squad.
Cheers to Mark for having the gusto to make this game!
Played a number of the smaller scenarios, great fun and lots of replayability. Played the full Day of Heroes, solid win to the Rangers. The end finale of a delta team in the target building providing covering fire was incredible. They got stuck with skinnies on the ground floor with them up top, under withering fire from multiple squads, an rpg in the walled area adjacent, a crossroad rpd and a technical with rr...a littlebird flew in and extracted them from the roof. Littles birds but heck are they tough :) One of the most exciting finishes to a wargame i have ever had.

RATING: 6
Man, I so wish this game (and the series) was better than it actually is. It's so graphically appealing, it takes a fundamentally sound approach I think, but the core move/fight/morale mechanics just feel *way* off. Shaken units are ludicrously vulnerable, MGs are shockingly impotent, and defenders in general just can't lay down any kind of significant fire to keep attackers at bay, even when defending open ground. OK if you're modeling Viet Cong or Somali mobs, not so good for professionals.

This whole game system just doesn't hold a candle to ASLSK, which is what I now intend to stick with.
---
LnL returns to the stuff it's good at IMHO, namely modern warfare. To me, this game feels a lot better than the various WWII incarnations. There is still some shockingly gamey stuff - oh, for the want of decent rules for machineguns and for shaken units to run away from melee - but there is also really good stuff in here too, I love the mobs and the square grid and the resilient but weak Somali units and the general asymmetry of the situation (funny, the Somali are basically Japanese from ASL - they really weren't afraid to rip stuff off, if only they had ripped off some of the really good stuff like residual firepower, routing, and fire lanes). I also find it oddly appealing that the scenarios seem, like Forgotten Heroes, to have a persistent anti-US gameplay bias.

Unfortunately, rules bloat seems to have caught up with LnL in the core rules. LnL isn't a tough game, but the presentation order of the rules is bad and too much game-specific stuff is in the core rules now. Day of Heroes is a little high-end, rules-wise, as this LnL stuff goes so it's a shame it's made more difficult by a shaky ruleset. LnL is not so good a game you want to struggle with the rules, it's a fast-playing action game, not (A)SL.

RATING: 7
After disappointment with Band of Heroes, Day of Heroes is a marked improvement. The system ports over well to Mogadishu and effort has been made to cut down on the efficacy of human wave attacks (particularly in this situation with the hordes of Somalis); requiring Somalis to make a morale check before entering melee. 

I'm still uncomfortable with the one-shot opportunity fire rules - strange situations like an MMC can run right in between two enemy MMCs that have already fired at point-blank range without any fear of being shot. But overall, I'm coming to accept that this is part of the LnL system and that I'm going to have to live with it. 

Overall, the game captures the desperate situation of the Americans being surrounded by enemy hordes but in that is also a flaw in the game. It is too American-centric. The Somalis are portrayed too one-dimensionally. They have only one objective - kill Americans. While I had fun with DoH, I'm still waiting for a Mogadishu game that captures the strategic considerations of the Somali irregular forces.

One final note - where are the Malaysians and their Condor APCs that went in to rescue the pinned-down Americans?

I'm a big fan of LnL and this is another fine entry in the series.  A very different set of tactical situations than one finds in other, more conventional titles, with potent American forces pitted against Somali mobs and gunmen.  The special rules add a lot of flavor with the Somalis receiving a constant stream of reinforcements from mobs and roadblocks.  Really a pleasure to play.

Looks great!  I'm going through the rules now.  A couple of differences between this and other L'nL games.  First, The board uses squares instead of hexes to effectively show the city layout.  Still, having read the rules I think it will work.  Secondly, there are no special events or cards for that randomizing effect.  I'll miss them but I'll give it a whirl soon.

I've played it a couple of times now and I love it!  It will be on my "Hot List" for a while.

Played twice, and at no time did I feel tactics or coordination made any significant difference. Combat system is a single die toss off. Morale is a single die, lucky or not.

After playing through each of the scenarios I'm liking this a lot.  The interest level is high as there are many "special" units like Delta Boys, SEALS, helicopters, grenade launchers and Somalian Mobs.  There are also some unusual mechanics, such as having to roll to see what actions the mobs will take, rolling to see what may or may not emerge from smoke-filled Somalian roadblocks and, my favourite - a die roll to help model the confusion and bad intel that set back the rescue convoy.  Best of all, though, is that none of this is very hard, despite the many special rules. As always, the gameplay is quick, action-packed and offers players a wide range of choices each and every turn.  What's more, the scenarios are exceptionally well crafted and, while a few may be a bit same-y, each side has every opportunity to win.  Really good stuff.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Good modern tactical game.  Excellent graphics and production values, especially the map.  Very good play value with a nice set of rules tailored to the situation.  Seems to capture the feel of The Battle of Mogadishu (based on the book and the movie "Black Hawk Down") fairly well from my pov.  More importantly, the game is fun to play.

The game system is streamlined, plays quickly, sort of like ATS light.  Definitely interested in other games using this system.

If you're interested in a modern squad level wargame with asymmetrical forces (and there aren't many), this one is definitely worth playing.

RATING: N/A
After an initial examination of the game, I would have only one minor nitpick: there doesn't seem to be enough counters. The rule system, in my opinion, could work to scale down to smaller groups of individuals--that would more accurately portray the chaos of the day rather than squads and half-squads.

Great quality, thought it is disappointing that they printed the second counter sheet twice as it were. meaning that the second counter sheet is the same halves reprinted side by side.which is why there are two identical sets of Somali leaders and a 2 identical initiative counters. It would have been cool if they included some extra goodies instead of mailing it in. I am still glad to have bought it..

I was really reluctant to try another LnL game after the disaster that was 1st game of Band of Brothers. Afterward it was very pleasant surprise, very nice mechanics and it all kinda worked, even on the map that was made of squares. Now I hope to get some more of this played. Probably should try Band of Brothers aswell again, maybe it was just bad luck with that and we messed up something, somewhere.

Having recently played a couple of the scenarios from A Day of Heroes I wanted to write down my thoughts on the game.  I don’t really want to write about the mechanics as that has been done excellently in other reviews.  Instead I want to look at the gameplay and whether the scenarios reflect the situation they are trying to model.  Anyone who has watched or read Black Hawk Down can only marvel at the accomplishments of the Ranger and Delta forces during the battle.  Facing overwhelming odds in an enclosed urban environment they managed to extract themselves as the original mission fell apart around them.

But enough of the preliminaries, how does it play?  The scenarios in A Day of Heroes have a small and well equipped US force facing a large but unruly Somalian force.  (One scenario has a force of Pakistani peace keepers ambushed by Somalian forces.)  The US forces have lots of automatic weapons and grenade launchers, while the Somalian’s have the ubiquitous RPGs and the odd heavy weapon.  Most of their support weaponry comes from looting dead US soldiers.

To me the scenarios do a good job of capturing the feel of fighting in a hostile urban environment.  This is reinforced by the special rules governing Somalian mobs.  These large groups block roads and make it difficult for US forces to move through them.  The US player can fire at them to try and disperse the mob but suffer victory point penalties, and the mob could turn violent and become a combatant as well.  The Somalian player can also create roadblocks of burning cars and tyres to force the US player to use alternate routes.  New Somalian forces are also created at these roadblocks each turn.

All the elements of the battle are present in the scenarios, including technicals (pick-up trucks with machine guns or recoiless rifles on the back), RPGs (Which can be quite deadly), outnumbered special forces troops, helicopter support, and a sense of desperation for the US player.

I found as the US commander I had to find a balance between aggression to achieve my objectives without being reckless and handing victory points to my opponent for letting them kill US soldiers.  I also found at times that the Somalian forces seemed to be coming out of the woodwork, which must have been how the US soldiers felt.  The mobs can turn nasty, and with the roadblocks generating new troops it can quickly become a swarm of enemy soldiers converging on your tiny group.

There is also a campaign game which looks very interesting.  The US forces are trying to get to the crash site to rescue the survivors and destroy the helicopter, while the Somalian force grows and grows with everything from squads to technicals rushing to cut you off.

Overall this is a very thematic game.  In my opinion it does a great job of representing the history, while still leaving lots of tough choices for the players, as well as giving them the chance to change history as well.  The scenarios also contain a high replayability factor as you try out different strategies.  I’ll finish there because I want to give the campaign a shot.

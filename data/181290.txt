RATING: 7
I played this at Essen and immediately bought it. The components are handsome, rules are light but the game has some depth. 

The downside is that it seems unfinished. The box says 2-4 players, the insert obviously has places for more components... and yet it only really supports two players. The four player rules are like a footnote in the book. 

I enjoy the game I bought, look forward to an expansion that "completes it,  but can't help feeling a bit cheated.

Un abstracto bastante entretenido, con muchas opciones, lo que permite gran variabilidad. El final llega por pequeños errores de alguno de los contrincantes. No lo he probado todavía a 4 jugadores, pero la experiencia a 2 es bastante agil. Creo que un amante de abstractos lo disfrutará más que yo, pero para mi es un juego correcto.

RATING: 6
Supports 4, but I can't imagine playing an abstract strategy game with any more than 2 people.

Seems like it could have a LOT of depth, but given that the board can rotate significantly it is very difficult to visualize options.  Also, it seems like the game can get drawn out if players play defensively. 

Would be good for the right person, but I would prefer 2P abstract games like Tash Kalar or Fealty.

Prototype gespeeld op festival.
Mooi gemaakt en best origineel concept.
Geen moeilijke regels.

Vechtertjes (blokjes) proberen mekaar omver te duwen, te verplaatsen, en uiteindelijk de zuil naar de andere kant te duwen.
Enkel strategie, geen enkel gelukselement.
Schaak, maar dan anders.
Niet mijn genre spel, daarom de lage score.  Ik houd hier gewoon niet van.  Er moet minstens een gelukselement aanwezig zijn.

I prefer Onitama over that but it is a worthy contester.
The component quality is pretty high and that pillar of ... Doom? ... is so heavy, it really supports the feeling.

KUMO Hogosha is a Japanese themed abstract strategy game where you and your opponent are fighting in the central rotating arena to push the Stone of Balance into the opponents' home court. On your turn you start with 5 actions (plus extra actions from any kumo you have imprisoned) and you can use 4 of your actions to grab, throw, run, jump, change your stance, free a kumotori from prison, put another kumo in a headlock etc. while one of your actions must be used to rotate the arena at least once. The first to push the Stone of Balance into the opponent camp wins!

My gaming partner and I both love abstracts and Japanese themed games so this was instantly attractive to both of us. The component quality from the box to the pieces are absolutely top notch and the premise is interesting. Despite how primed we were to like it, it would sit for months on the shelf unplayed and in fact was unplayed for over a year before I traded it. No matter how much we tried to focus on it we could never seem to prioritise getting it played and neither of us knew why as we both thought we liked it. The nearest I can figure is that a few things make it feel kind of irritating to play:-
1. You always felt like you were robbed of a move because one of the moves you must make on your turn is to rotate the arena and usually you found that you needed an extra move on your turn to either eject your opponent from the arena or to put yourself out of harm's way. 
2a. The use of 2 identical factions versus having 2 asymmetric ones seems like a wasted opportunity. Many times we seemed to mirror each others' moves, even unintentionally, as with being able to freely choose which kumo to use we just tended to select the best option. 
2b. This free choice I feel is another wasted opportunity as since the kumo pieces are referred to as 'dice' they should actually be rolled to see what the move options for each person should be. When you have 2 identical factions that move in exactly the same way without being really limited by anything then it's kind of a free for all. 

TL;DR I like the theme, the artwork, the components and the idea of the gameplay but somehow it just didn't all come together for us and a game that gets played only 4 times since the middle of 2016 needs to be moved on. We always needed to be in the right mood to play it and that mood never struck.

Gyönyörű kivitelezés, de az ennyire absztrakt játék már nem az én világom. Ráadásul gyakorlatilag két fős, mert a többjátékos mód igen kamukás. Ennyi erővel bármit lehet, bármennyien játszani. Vannak benne jó ötletek, aki szereti az absztrakt cuccokat, annak mindenképp ajánlott.

Gorgeous game, decent strategy, crappy rule book.  There was a lot of searching on the internet needed to figure out some of the details of play.  What it really needs are more teams with different kinds of movement...something it'll never get because I think I'm one of the 12 people that bought it.  Try adding 1 minute timer house rule for deciding your move, it makes the game way better once you know how to play.

Very, very enjoyable game..
Easy to learn,  haaaard to master.
If you like strategy games with no luck involved, this is a must!
And it doesn't hurt that it comes with top quality components.

RATING: 8
This game combines two interesting ideas to form a tight little strategy game that looks beautiful. Firstly, using dice as playing pieces whose moves depend on what side is up makes for some surprising decision space. Secondly, a board that can (and indeed must) be rotated adds another dimension to think about.
Lovely game.

I really wanted to love this game.  The first time I played I was extremely interested in its strategic potential.  But after playing several times, I realized it's almost impossible to maintain any real strategy, primarily because you and you're opponent get 5 moves (really 4) per turn and the number of move combinations is so ridiculously high you can never anticipate exactly what your opponent will do.  In effect, this makes each turn seemingly random and purely reactive.  Maybe there's a really, REALLY deep strategy that I'm just not seeing, but I doubt it and I'm not going to waste my time trying to figure it out.  That being said, the theme is still very neat and I really like the artwork.

Es gibt 6 versch. Arten von Sumos. In meiner Runde kann ich einen Sumo auf das Feld einsetzen, das Feld drehen, einen Sumo in eine andere Form bringen, laufen, Sonderaktion durchführen, ... Das Ziel ist es einen Stein der Balance, der in der Mitte des Feldet steht auf seine eigene Seite zu schieben. Dabei kann auch gegnerische Sumos gefangen nehmen um mehr Aktionen zu bekommen bzw. dem Gegner diese zu klauen.
Die Regeln sind furchtbar geschrieben. Ein Absatz in der englischen Anleitung war auf einmal komplett französisch (da hat der Übersetzter wohl kein Bock gehabt), die französische blieb aber französisch! FAQ wurde ebenfalls direkt beigelegt, was über die Regeln ja schon etwas aussagt ;).
Das Spiel ist echt gut. Eher abstrakt, aber mit sehr schönem Material. Wenn die Regeln mal klar sind (bei uns nach 3 Spielen) erschliessen sich auch Dinge wie: Warum sollte ich den Gegner gefangen nehmen? Ich kann nicht aus der Arena laufen, muss beim schieben also hinter dem Stein stehen, etc.

Kumo Hogosha is an abstract game dressed up in some very pretty theme. The quality is literally dripping from the awesomely made and designed box right through to the components. The game is currently symmetrical but there are plans to release new clans to make it asymmetrical.

Each player has six cubes, which represent your kumo. Each side of the cube is a different move and during your turn you will use your five actions to move and activate your various cubes and their abilities. Actually four actions as one action must always be to rotate the arena 90º. Did I mention the arena rotates? The object of the game is to push the stone of balance into your opponents side of the board, but this is easier said than done when it requires two kumos to do so and the board could be rotated back removing all your hard work. You can earn extra actions by capturing the opponent and altogether this game hangs together incredibly nicely. As yet it is not really a four player game but that may change with the expansions.

It's an ok game for now. I need to play this more often to get a good feel for it. It feels a lot like a do-undo type of game so I wonder whether it should take a little longer than our game did with more considered sumo placement and ability combos. Definitely requires more play.

This is a very abstract. We just played 2p. I think it might be crazy with 4p, not learning that you can play with 4. You are placing these cubes down and depending on the face that is up you can do the actions on the cubes. You get a certain number of actions but 1 of them always has to be rotating the board 90 degrees. It is VERY hard to "see" the board. You are attempting to push the pillar in the middle off the other side of the board. It is just crazy! I enjoyed it, but it is not something I want to play a lot.

Let's break it into different elements:
-Rulebook:
Not good. It is not horrific (meaning that with some effort you can still learn/understand the rules) but the rules are explained very quickly and it's a little bit difficult to learn the game from it without checking every rule 3 times. The idea of a second rulebook with the dice movements is nice, but I would have liked to have the base rules explained better (there are a good number of images, but not enough text, in my opinion). Moreover, some of the pages of the English rulebook were in French..

-Box:
Awesome! Great attention to details in the planning and the design. Very, very nice: I liked it a lot! Probably one of the best game box I own.

-Components:
Very good artwork and sturdy cardboard components. The dice are not perfect (the edges are a little bit damaged), but still OK. The pin to rotate the central board doesn't fit very well in the main board. Nothing impossible to fix, but it clashes with the perfection of the game box.

-Gameplay:
A little bit brain crunching, but funny! It's like a very light version of chess where your pieces can morph into different ones. And the game length is not too long.

-Overall:
A nice game with very good artwork and minor flaws in the components (that do NOT affect the gameplay). The game is engaging, but some players may be prone to AP. In my opinion, this is a 2-players only game and I don't feel the need to try the 4-players version.

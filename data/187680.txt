09.02.2016: Solo für 3P gespielt (18, 14, 13). Spiel ist irregulär gelaufen, weil ich für jeden Spieler statt 2 nur jeweils 1 Aktion ausgeführt habe. Das reicht aber auch zum Kennenlernen der Mechanismen, wirklich solo geht das Spiel nicht.

Aus einer offenen Auslage heuert man Leute an. Die Kosten (0-3 Handkarten) zahlt man durch Abwerfen von Karten, die man auf der Hand hat. Diese Leute ("Bürger") kommen aus vier verschiedenen Gruppen (Krieger, Handwerker pp) und bringen etwas mit (Stärke, Magie, Gold). 

Mit den ausgelegten Bürgern kann man Aufträge ("Quests") ausführen, wenn man deren Voraussetzungen erfüllt. Das sind zum einen 1 oder 2 Bürger bestimmter Berufsgruppe und zum anderen bestimmte Mengen an Stärke u/o Magie u/o Gold. Alle Karten, die man zur Erfüllung der Voraussetzungen braucht, legt man aus der eigenen Auslage ab.

Bürger, die man anheuert, und Aufträge, die man erfüllt, geben einem meist zusätzliche Aktionen, die man als Teil der Aktion Anheuern bezw. Auftrag erfüllen ausführen kann.

Als Aktionen gibt es: 1 Karte ziehen, 1 Bürger anheuern, 1 Auftrag reservieren (legt man offen in die eigene Auslage), einen Auftrag erfüllen.

Das Spiel endet, wenn ein Spieler 5 Aufträge erfüllt hat. Es gewinnt, wer die meisten SP hat. SP bekommt man für erfüllte Aufträge. Dann gibt es noch Zusatzpunkte für die Erfüllung von Aufträgen bestimmter Art (Handel, Kampf usw.), je nachdem, welches geheime Ziel man zu Spielbeginn zugewiesen bekommen hat.

Das Spiel erscheint relativ einfach, ist aber noch zu erkunden.

Ergänzung 07.02.2017:

Das nunmehr erschienene Originalspiel hat eine Solo-Regel.

-------------------------
A new take on the lords of water deep system... and it's pretty dang fun.  I think this is my favorite "Valeria" game so far, but we'll see how this holds up after more plays.  I think if you enjoy lords of water deep, then you will probably enjoy this game as well since it really is "Lords of Waterdeep: The Card Game".

Lords of Waterdeep the card game with tableau element and chain reactions.
The graphics are top notch, but the game is too abstract for my taste. Is just collecting Icons with limited control.
No story, no arc, just flat and lifeless.
Also that you build and discard your tableau for the quest is kind awkward.
Positive is the short playtime.
Solo game is boring ans pointless.

I've been thinking of a way to better describe Quests of Valeria for sometime and I'm having a hard time of it... One of the players in my group described it as a cross between The Builders: Middle Ages and Lords of Waterdeep. I guess to some extent that's a pretty apt description. I think its more along the lines of hand management. The gameplay experience was good, its nothing earth shattering and I don't see it sticking around for long.

RATING: 7
The best of the Valeria bunch, though it's so similar to Villages that I have difficulty remembering which is which. I like the Glory to Rome cards-as-resources mechanic, which really makes this game fly by. Turns are quick, decisions are interesting, cards combo nicely, and the whole package comes together to make a great little filler. This will probably remain in our collection for a long time.

Kickstarted.

Following in the footsteps of its previous two hits, Quests of Valeria had some big shoes to fill. The smallest footprint of the bunch, yet still attempting to capture the feel and mechanics of its predecessors was no easy task. Thankfully QoV succeeds in its goal, serving an an excellent compliment to the Valeria trilogy. 

Gamers familiar with the other games will feel right at home with QoV. The Mico's artwork is standard-issue exceptional and the mechanic of multi-use cards will be familiar anyone who has played Villages of Valeria. For those who enjoy the previous installments in this world, they 'll likely enjoy this one as well. 

The good news is that newcomers won't find themselves lost. The rulebook is easy to follow and the game only takes a few turns to "get". By the end of the first game, the majority of the mechanics make sense. Once mastered, play-throughs are quick as at the race to complete 5 quests (accomplished by purchasing heroes from a tableau to meet quest requirements) is constantly pressing players to make tough decisions with hand management. Combining this with little to no down-time on turns, and QoV is a fun, fast game that leans closer to a heavy filler and is a game that finds its way to our table fairly regularly. If you're a fan of Valeria or are looking for a game that's crunchy enough for regular gamers and newbies alike, QoV is well worth the investment.

If you love the quests/quest completion concept in Lords of Waterdeep, you'll likely enjoy this.

Played a 3-player game.  All 3 of us had never tried this before, so we were all learning the mechanics.  Game took an hour in all, with a fair amount of rulebook checking to clarify hire actions.

A little confusing in how "chain hiring" can/can't be used, will need to look at an online playthrough to see if we missed something.

Will look to try this with 2/4 players.  I imagine 5 would lead to a lot of downtime.

Once again, the Valeria line comes through with an unexpectedly good game. This is a card game only, no dice, whereby you're acquiring to your tableau (hiring) cards with the right symbols in order to fulfill quests (for VPs, 'natch). The hook is, the cards you acquire frequently have action symbols on them which allow you to immediately take those actions. So you can chain some actions a la Dominion but nowhere near as annoying as that.

You might hire a card that allows you to hire another card as well as draw a card. That other card you hired allows you to draw another card. That's all just one of your two actions per turn. 

Once someone fulfills their fifth quest, the game ends at the end of the round. It's the same artwork and symbols as Card Kingdoms which makes for some nice consistency. There is a good bit of take-that as some cards allow you to randomly take a card from someone's hand or kill one of their hired cards, but none of it has felt more than mildly annoying. 

A reasonably interesting filler and quite compact. Glad I have in my collection.

Set collection game with great art and some fun mechanics. My biggest complaint is the amount of iconography to learn. It's not a big deal once you know how to play but it makes teaching it a bit more challenging than usual and holds it back from being a great gateway game, which is unfortunate since it is fairly simple and would otherwise be good for that.

RATING: 4
Isolate the quests from The Lords of Waterdeep, and you have this game.  Very little originality.  A disappointment since I like the other Valeria games, and a bigger disappointment because it seems like a cheap & shortened copy of a game I truly love (Lords of Waterdeep).

Perhaps would play again for a complete newby's sake.

This is a fun little card game of gathering cards and their related symbols and goods in order to spend them to complete quests ala Lords of Waterdeep.  A really nice quality production with thick components, high quality cards, and artwork that is colorful, vibrant and has a rather fun style to it too.  I think the production value really gives this game a boost.  Gameplay is fun which should sustain it though maybe not for too frequent playing.

Once you get past learning the icons the game is very clean and easy to play.  There is a lot of strategy in this little game.  It definitely gets deeper as you go.  I noticed with each play through we slowed down our turns a bit to make sure we caught everything we could.  With more players downtime at the end of the game could get bad but I've yet to try it.  I will definitely be playing this one several more times.

Waterdeep the Card Game although I must say I don't think I enjoy it as much, it is not smooth and fast like LWD.

This game lends itself strongly to AP so it can be frustrating at higher player counts, it also feels a tad unfinished, but it is still very enjoyable to play.

SOlD just really doesn't flow well, slow at high player counts , lacks somthing to complete it

RATING: 7.5
Essentially a card version of Lords of Waterdeep. It's best at 2 and pretty good at 3. Do NOT play with more though. At 5 it ran way too long. With 2, you can plan your turn mostly while your opponent is playing as the markets do not change hugely, but also since it is just a back and forth, you don't wait long to go again even if a player takes a few moments to play. At 3 the wait increases a little, but players can still do most of their thinking on others turns and it also adds an interesting dynamic of who to target o=for negative effects and helps pull back a run-away leader. With 4/5 it becomes a mess. As it's very unlikely that ANY cards in the market are still there when it comes back around to your turn, you can't plan far in advance and it encourages players to not bother planning UNTIL their turn starts. This means a long wait between every turn and also feels a little too random.

Good game, but the weakest in the Valeria series so far, but that is not a knock as I really enjoy the other two games.  Game is Lords of Waterdeep the card game, but to me the game does not last long enough.  You play to 5 completed quests and it does not leave me satisfied at that number.  I think the game would be better it you played to X total completed quests or even just a higher number per player.

[b]Quests of Valeria[/b] 

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (4):[/COLOR]

[i]The sales pitch for Quests of Valeria, [i]Lords of Waterdeep the card game,[/i] had me hooked. Unfortunately the game play didn't deliver. The game plays out exactly like LoW except you are using cards to trigger actions. So far so good, but the game quickly breaks down do to constraints put on you that really don't enhance game play in any way. There are quests face up, but the problem is everyone is trying to complete the same public quests so you can't plan on a quest being there long term. On top of that you can only reserve one quest at a time which drags the game out and doesn't add tension to the game, just frustration. 

The second problem is the iconography is not intuitive and there are too many abilities to keep track of for what amounts to a very simple game. In the end the game dragged on for way too long and we were all trying to end the game as quickly as possible without worrying about winning, not fun. The concept of Quests is great, but the execution falls completely flat.[/i]

If you've played Lords of Waterdeep, it's basically the questing aspect of that game.  Nothing new happening, but it's a fun game.  It's relatively quick and balanced.

I'm usually much more of a "board gamer" than a "card gamer", but this one is a solid one.  I highly recommend it.

A decent game and very quick. It's like a faster card version of Lords of Waterdeep for the most part. The different being hiring adventurers from your hand or at the tavern instead of worker placement spots. Although you aren't really blocking people from hiring, there's ways to steal people that were hired by your opponents so that seems to give the same feel.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A game about action efficiency, in which you have little control about the efficiency of your actions.  A game about managing tempo, in which the best answer is always to wait as long as possible.  Mostly, it's a game about lining up icons to see if they match.

It's like the most boring part of Lords of Waterdeep.  IT's like a mechanic designed to support an interesting mechanic, but without the interesting mechanic.  It's like the designers got the game working and then decided that 'working' is the same as interesting/fun/finished.  It's like it's a kickstarter.

I'm a fan of the Valeria Card Kingdoms, but I've been utterly bored by the other games set in the same universe.

[Daily Magic Game 2016 edition] {Valeria; card-drafting, secret-goal, action-point; optimal 3p} In Quests of Valeria, players try to collect the most victory points by completing different (desired) quests.  The secret goal adds fun to the game, but still the player with more completed quests usually wins.

It is easy to understand the actions of this game.  Each turn, each player needs to perform 2 actions.  The luck of draw is not strong in this case but players can still push their luck to find a quest that they want.  Yet, sometimes, you need to wait for the appropriate citizen to show up.

The card illlustration is wonderful, but the Hire Power is too artificial with letters.  A player mat is very welcome.

Really nice small game. Reminds me the light version of Lords of Waterdeep. Small box and player count 1-5 makes this game ideal to put in bag and take it with you everywhere. Also visuals and quality of components is really good. This is the first Valeria game I played and have but it might not be the last. :-)

This is essentially Lords of Waterdeep: The Card Game.  You get a similar vibe playing it, but worker placement has been replaced by building up simple card tableaus.

It's a fine game, but maybe a little too light to keep one's interest long-term.  I've played too many card games that present the players with difficult decisions, which makes a game like this feel a bit "kiddy."  The positive to that, though, is that it's easy to teach, learn and play.

Great looking cards.  It looks quite distinct from other fantasy games.

Many similarities to Lords of Waterdeep...Hidden end game scoring role....but with cardplay currency instead of D&Deeples (or cubes).  Lots of symbols to decipher, som are more straightforward than others.  But plenty of opportunities to trigger/chain bonus actions constructively.  A fun quick game Highly recommended

*Rating based on one play.

I'm not particularly a hockey fan, but I enjoy sports-themed games.  This one is decent, but is very simple (I have the same problem with the DC Deck Builder on which this one is based).  It just feels like they could have done so much more with the game.  I guess it's just targeted at a more casual audience than me.

My wife and I have played it and really enjoy it.

The game is not a simulation of a hockey game and the role of the players and a coach.

This card building type game seem to emulate the role of a general manager in building a team.

Update: I had to get rid of the game.  It really does not work as a two player game.  When I took it to game meetings I could never get anyone to play it.

I enjoy the DC Comics deckbuilding game, and I'm a hockey fan. No, it's not any kind of simulation of a hockey game, but it's fun just the same. If you play the DC comics version, the transition is seamless. Instead of hero characters, you have team captains. Supervillains are now goalies. Card categories by color react pretty much the same - only the text has changed. The game engine could probably be adapted not just to any sport, but to any aspect of life: politics, cooking, academia (think Avalanche Press' "Survival of the Witless") etc. It's light fare that can be finished in less than an hour.

While they may be a little on the simple side, I enjoy the Cryptozoic deck builders.  I felt this game did a pretty good job of conveying the theme.  And kudos to them for adapting their system to a sports theme, as good sports games can be hard to find outside of the stat-based card and dice systems (APBA, SOM, etc.))

Maybe not quite as good as Ascension/Star Realms, but better than DC/Legendary/Dominion.

What a fun deckbuilder! If you are at all a hockey fan you should pick this up. While it isn't set up like a traditional game of hockey, it still gives you the feel of intensity and action found in a real NHL game! The engine (cerberus, think Star Realms) is familiar, but works incredibly well with the theme. I can't wait for the expansions!

I picked this up at Gencon. Fun game ---if you like the "Cerberus game engine" that Cryptozoic uses for all of its deckbuilders. Very light but quite fun.    

Two players is the most thematic, but even then you are both trying to score on the same goalie.  4 players can play as 2v2 teams or separately.  3 players works well.

A clone of DC Comics Deck-Building Game, but as odd as it sounds, I think the theme works better here. You'll be skating, passing, drawing penalties -- well, abstractly. 

I like the fact that your team is trying to score on a goalie. Although all players (of the game, not hockey players) are scoring on the same goalie, it reminds me of pond shinny, so I can look past this. Anyhow, when you score, take that goalie. The one with the most goalies at the end wins.

The concept of defenders, adding to the 'power' of the goaltender is one of the more fascinating aspects. Do you attempt a shot on an goalie with 11 power when you only have 11 as well? What if your opponents play defenders?

Fake shots, tricking your opponent to play a powerful defender, is an interesting tactic.

Long story short, if you are a hockey fan looking for a light deck-builder, give this a shot. Don't bother with DC Deck-Builder; there are many superior superhero deck-builders on the market.

Note: I only started tracking in January of 2017, so please ignore the play count.

Generic deck-builder that's just like all of the other Cryptozoic Cerberus games, but NOW WITH HOCKEY PLAYERS!!!  This game might have been interesting if it included some sort of dexterity mechanic for scoring goals.

Cryptozoic modifies its deck building system for an NHL theme, the most notable connection being the fact that it's the goalies you beat (or "score on") that determine the winner rather than the roster (or deck points) like other games. You can either build or take a shot, and penalties accrued cause you to miss a turn if you gain two. Thankfully, the way the cards are designed, it should become easier and easier to succeed at taking a shot as your deck gets bigger. My only complaint is that the individual players are not different in their abilities, being just different names for the same abilities.

PLUS: ease of learning, speed of play, interaction, theme
MINUS: lack of full variety

Great game.  I was worried it was going to be too simple from reading the rules, but it turns out to have tons of variety and some deal strategies to employ.  Tons of fun for a hockey fan or a deck building fan.

This game is surprizingly fun. I had my doubts, but I saw other people playing it at my local board game club and they had a BLAST. I tried it, it was really good. It's simpler than many other deckbuilders but, in my opinion, but fun nevertheless.

An Ascension-style deckbuilder (shared random trade row) where the twist is that players must declare at the start of their turn whether they are playing to buy new cards for their deck or to score a victory point -- either way, the other option is not available. This leads to weighing whether a hand that is almost good enough to score VP (say, $7 of the $9 required, but with some card draw) should gamble for the VP and risk coming up short or settle for the valuable purchase for a future turn. Additionally, "defender" cards provide some interaction by allowing inactive players to increase the difficulty of VP scoring attempts, though those cards' benefit to the owning player is reduced in the process.

The main shortcoming, in my opinion, is that deck thinning is very rare. Coupled with the random trade row, this presents the possibility of being forced to buy middling cards with no opportunity to remove them later.

I don't usually care for deckbuilders, but the theme gives me great enjoyment playing this one. I think i enjoyed this one slightly more so than Harry Potter Battle of Hogwarts deckbuilder. NHL is a faster play, but the quality isn't even close. The game comes with a cardboard standee goal post that you sit the goalie cards up in front of, so that's pretty cool. But the box insert quality is garbage, and the dividers end up bending the cards because they're not aligned well.

I got this game due to the NHL theme and the deck building mechanic.  I did not go in with super high hopes, but I walked away really enjoying this game.  I hope to see some new players and expansions over time.  A light deck builder but very enjoyable.  However, when shelf space got thin it missed the cut.  Sold at DTC 2017.

Really enjoyed this game, I will admit I'm a huge hockey fan though.  Cards are all high def pictures from in-game moments.  Plays fast, a lot like many other deck building games.  If you're a fan of NHL and deckbuilding, you'll love it.  I demoed it at gencon and somehow built myself a team of all offense and penalty taking, no defense.  Which reminded me of a certain orange and black team I'm a fan of...

I was completely surprised by how much I ended up liking this game.  The choice between taking a shot or buying cards from the center line, combined with the strong mechanical differentiation between attacks and defenders, provides a press-your-luck experience that is far more engaging than any other Cryptozoic deckbuilder to date.

The only "nerd game" my husband will actually play with me.  I love this game! The fact that your opponent(s) can play defense and you're taking a risk in taking a shot on goal makes it that much more interesting.

This is not a bad little deck builder, especially if you love hockey. Lots of different strategies can be tried and different captains special abilities mixes it all up. Light but fun.

Looked interesting at first but not sure anymore.
Doesn't seem to be a hockey simulation as much as just a card game with pictures of hockey players.

A pretty standard deck building game with a hockey theme.  Seems pretty random and chaotic compared to other games in the same genera.  More of a push your luck game.  It can be difficult to transform your deck rather you mostly just add to it.  Additionally, the start powers don't seem to be balanced.  However,
I do like the choice of taking a shot rather than a standard turn because it opens up different abilities on some of the cards wish the game could emphasize this aspect more but  as it is, the game was just okay for me.

March 2015: Better than you might think.  Dominion meets a real-life professional sports license.  But the number of cards you end up playing in a turn becomes way too large to be fun.  Wish that had reeled that in a bit.  Otherwise it's pretty cool.  Definitely worth trying out.  But I need to rate it a 6.5 instead of a 7.5 due to what I just explained.

My husband loves this theme and the fact that the theme comes together better than it in the DC version of this game (which this is very similar to in structure). He'd rather play this one that that one.  The idea of getting goals really helps the theme. (JW)

Deck building game with an NHL hockey theme.  There are certain card combos feels like hockey in general.  There is an interesting mechanic for shooting on goal to score like in hockey.  Scores are like hockey where you score 0-5 goals per player in a game.  Deck building game experience recommended.  This is not a game to introduce people to deck building games.

Une version simplifié d'Ascension. Matériel ordinaire *la qualité des cartes laisse `désirer), le thème est plus cool, mais le rythme est moins rapide et les tours plus répétitifs. Vraiment pour les amateurs de hockey.

Surprisingly one of the better implementations of the Cerberus engine (see [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamefamily/23550/cerberus-engine-heroes]here[/url] and [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamefamily/26406/cerberus-engine-middle-earth]here[/url]), if not the very best.  Though at last one team captain is severely overpowered.

Player cards aren't worth VP, so you don't end up purchasing random cards just for the sake of points.  And thankfully the goalie (villain) cards aren't recruited into the player decks, which helps avoid the horrific rich-get-richer syndrome that plagues the entire line of Cryptozoic deck-builders.

The central "Shot On Goal" mechanic is also sufficiently smart that it was reimplemented in both [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/160958/dc-comics-deck-building-game-rivals-batman-vs-joke]DC Rivals[/url] and its offspring: [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/221368/dc-deck-building-game-confrontations]DC Confrontations[/url].

It's possible to be stymied by multiple Defender cards in 3+ player games, which could get annoying.  But I've only tried 2p so far, so it's difficult to predict.

+ Puts all the parts of an RTS into a card game; Gives tons of "customization" options but does it in a way that prevents the majority of the decisions from being made ahead of time.

*EDIT* (owner off full PnP) With 20'ish games under the belt, I feel comfortable upgrading the score to a 10. Works flawlessly as Play-by-Forum, and the game is a totalt blast!


Magic fan for 20 or so years. I've never played constructed seriously, due to the silly costs involved. I prefer making weird decks for casual play or drafting for (semi-)serious play.

I really like drafting since you are making your deck up on the spot, almost all the cards in the set being playable and the variation you get. But, again, the costs are silly. And when actually playing the drafted decks, a lot of games are just decided by mana screw/flood. Or won by the person who got lucky and drafted a planeswalker.

So for me, Codex is the perfect draft alternative: variety, fixed cost, improved mechanics.

I also like deck builders a lot, but got quite bored by the solitary versions. Puzzle Strike and Trains are my favorite in that genre, since they both added interesting mechanics surrounding the deck building. Codex takes it even one step further with the asymmetry, which I really enjoyed in Puzzle Strike.

At first, I was a little bit weirded out by some of the flavor choices (turtles, fruit ninjas) but I've come to accept/like most of them, the previews for the other factions (http://www.sirlin.net/codex/) helping a lot in that regard! Man, the flavor of the Blue and Black techs is just awesome!

This scratches that 'hearthstone' itch for me. Never really got into MTG. I like the different factions, the ramp up, etc. I'm also happy it's a complete set - no lcg packs or boosters to buy. Solid game in my mind.

My favorite competitive asymmetric game with deck building...  scratch that.  My favorite game.  This game is not for people that don't want conflict as this game is all about conflict.

Pros:
- This can probably be seen as a con to some, but I really dig that it is basically about each player picks 3 heroes and goes.  This means there is a lot less fine tuning that can be done to a deck, so less creative options are available between games as you agonize over what to put in your deck, but by picking 3 you still remain open to a lot of variety in strategies.  Smart tactical play is still critical to overall success.
- As complex as the game is, it is pretty easy to teach and learn.
- Great translation of an RTS game to card game.
- It is possible to own everything, without a constant or extremely pricey commitment.
- Images of map cards available even if you didn't buy Deluxe Set.  (If you want PnP copy, it will cost you.)
- 

Cons:
- Unless you buy the Deluxe Set, buying a "complete" game that satisfies the specified player count becomes an exercise.  I didn't buy the Deluxe Set and ended up picking up the Starter Set, Core Set, Both Expansions.  This left me missing 3 extra boards, map cards, 4 additional binders, 3 pairs of extra spec cards, and a big box to store everything and the insert.  I do have 2 starter set boards that normally don't ship with the Deluxe Set, but they look different than the standard boards and were designed for 1 hero.  I wish the starter boards  were printed on both sides to allow for multi-hero or single hero games.

In my heart, I believe that while a normal set, obtained by buying as parts, is capable of supporting play for 2 players and the deluxe set for 5, to best enjoy this game every player should have their own copy of the game.  This will enable the most freedom when building a codex.

RATING: 6
:d10-2:
12/16: Now with the official game, and played as 2-player, this game is quite good. Once my playing partner and I know the mechanics and cards well enough, I think the brain load time will become quite manageable, even if slower than M:TG. Upgraded to an 8.

2/16: I hesitate to rate this a 6, because I will never support the designer for his heinous attitude towards other designers' work and disrespect towards anyone who doesn't agree with him (and even some who do).

But it's a pretty decent Magic derivative, and I'm interested in exploring it further (on a secondhand copy or the free pnp, of course) to see if it's worthy of a higher rating. If 6 ends up being the ceiling for the gameplay, Codex will drop to 1 for the other reasons.

Codex is a great balance between the complex decisions in MTG and the simplicity  of a deck builder all rolled into a smooth, fun package. Finally a stand alone card game that doesn't require investment like a CCG/LCG but has the diversity in both play and archetypes to satisfy both casual and hardcore gamers.

Has quickly become my new favorite game. I do sometime wish that games and turns could happen quicker but even after a dozen+ games, our turns still seem to take an amount of time that might be problematic for competitive play. Codex feels like a great way to scratch the "I want to play magic" and the "i want to StarCraft" nostalgia itches at once, while being much more free form and exploratory than either, thus far. Would be interested to hear if anyone has any ideas on time controls.

Codex is a thinky dueling game, that gets to the action quickly and allows different approaches to winning, by offering lots of combos and counters available to each player. It does have some randomization so timings and build orders aren't 100% predictable. It also offers some ways to bluff and mindgame, rewards good timing and is attractive to both strategic and tactical play.
The cardeffects are interesting and the deckconstructing is so simple to allow even casual players to enjoy it. The balance of mono-colour decks seems fine, I can't comment on mixed colours yet.

Excellent game!!!

Kickstarted and have pnp

Only played starter set 1x1 hero and there's a lot to like here, and I really want to try the 3x3 full game.

Takes a bit of MtG, bit of Hearthstone, bit of MageWars, bit of RTS and mixes them to a clever 1v1 quick deckbuilder.

Love the fact that mana/resource screw is fixed, love that you can decide your hand (play too many cards and you'll have less in future turns), love you cycle your deck so fast making every card matter. 

Didn't think I'd love the 'you do nothing on your opponent's turn - no counters, no decisions just watch' but after playing a lot of Hearthstone I'm fine with it, and it does mean the turns are faster. Prefer this now to MtG.

Only real downside is it's deep - a new player is going to struggle against an experienced player, not sure how you'd handicap for that (other than learn quick!).

*** Update, paid for the PnP - and the expansions add so much more. Here's a customisable game that gives the asynchronous experience with no need to buy blind packs.

Shame there's not a computer version as I'd be playing it all the time.

Rating up to a 10 now.

Deep, engrossing game that does possess an RTS feel. This has tons of replayability and doesn't mimic the LCG subscription structure. Very enjoyable gameplay where you will use only a fraction of your options, offering a wide range of choices.

The only downside to this game is the huge mental requirement of understanding a faction's cards. There's no deckbuilding prior to play but there is digesting large amounts of information as you sit down to play.

Codex... 我個人對情景交錯的桌遊一向不大討好(例如Duel of ages),  除非它本身是可輕鬆和快捷易上手如Smash up, 或是有令玩家信服的解釋(例如 Time stories),   Codex 機制打著要爭取MtG 的玩家垂青, 也希望得到Ashes, Netrunner , AGoT 和Mage wars 玩家的愛戴和支持。可見在產品也有心思, 在deluxe set 中應有盡有(有不同顏色族類cards book 6本像MW 的spell book, 有playmats, 有card board, 有計分life track 轉盤像LotR LCG還有整齊 insert 等),   機制層面雖然我不見有大突破但這類遊戲應不會有問題 (除非是定義不清，用字不當和族類失衡)。在bgg 多人有10分的評價反而令我感覺有造馬之疑, 可能是我多疑。我覺得Codex有可取之處但我自己不太喜歡那情景交錯令人難代入的主題和 artwork 不太一致旳表達。有很多人擁有太陽還想擁抱月亮, 我自知暫不想抱月入懷。

Early access first impression: Five plays in I feel compelled to register my excitement in some way.  This game does so much right.  It's a hodgepodge design that   thoughtful and constructive interventions in every genre it mixes.  I can't wait to explore this more.  Puzzle Strike and Yomi are both impressive designs, but this has potential to be something much bigger.

RATING: 10
This game is incredible. There are too many good things to say about this. The way deckbuilding works is absolutely beautiful, acting as a fog of war and also as a form of "tech switch" a la Starcraft. The tech tree is perfectly crafted as far as costs and minimum requirements necessary, as well as how tech upgrades affect your gameplay. The system shines on its own, but what makes this game so mindblowingly awesome and crunchy are the myriad of different and good strategy options offered by your heroes and the cards in your codex. I love it in spite of how terrible I am at it.

For now, I'm a bit burned out on it, but I'll be right back in the thick of it when the time comes.

AN EXPLANATION OF CODEX TO MAGIC: The Gathering (MTG) PLAYERS

Welcome to Codex: Card-Time Strategy!  This is David Sirlin's 10-year project, which I'd like to call a Living Deck-Building Game (LDBG).  This game has no blind components. You are not required to buy booster packs, find hidden cards or buy singles to get the tools you need.  Some advice from someone who has played Magic: The Gathering (MTG) for nearly 20 years- buy the deluxe version of Codex, now!  Although it is possible to play Codex with a single faction, you really want all six of the colored factions, plus the two colorless renegades, to fully experience this game.  Some other players may have down-voted Codex, because they only played with the colorless renegade decks and/or factions that didn't match their play style or offer the full experience.  Get the deluxe version, while its still available. You'll thank me later.     

CODEX EXPLAINED AS AN MTG PLAYER
Codex is like playing with a fixed starting deck, which you modify as the game progresses.  You modify your deck by selecting  cards from an enormous transformative sideboard called the Codex.  You get to choose any two cards from your Codex, at the end of each of your turns, to incorporate into your deck.  In addition, you also have access to a roster of three heroes that function like commanders in MTG's EDH format; including the rule where they reside outside the deck, in a specific command zone, so that they can be played from there.  There is no "commander tax" as heroes don't have their costs adjusted after being knocked-out, but they are unavailable for a short while.  The heroes all have "level-up" abilities, which function almost exactly like the mechanic of the same name from MTG's Rise of the Eldrazi.  This makes them a solid pick at any stage of the game, early or late.  The key thing is your starting deck is small (10 cards), but your graveyard is shuffled into your library when you run out of cards to draw.  It's possible to convert obsolete cards, usually basic ones that may have been good early game but begin to show age in the late game, by exiling them into the worker zone.      

There are some special rules to note:  Codex has no instants or "stack," because turns are conducted asynchronously.  The non-active player chooses two cards from his/her Codex to modify his/her library with, while the active player conducts the majority of his/her actions in a single main phase.  It's quite popular for people to play Codex over internet forums, since each player's turn can be "mailed-in."  Codex has a modular main phase, which allows any combination of unit/hero attacks, casting spells, building upgrades, etc.  Spells are in their own class of card type. Spells are only able to be cast at sorcery speed, providing you have at least one of your heroes in the battlefield under your control.  Some spells, like the ones chosen from the Codex, require a specific hero to be in the battlefield in order to be cast at all.  Unlike MTG, units/heroes in Codex are able to attack any opposing object directly, be it unit/hero/building as directed, providing the defending Patrol Zone is clear.  Unit/hero damage is constant in Codex- it is not removed at end of turn like in MTG.  

Codex uses a unique Patrol Zone feature- a line of defense where readied (untapped) units/heroes can slot into so that they absorb enemy attacks, preventing damage to buildings or other sidelined or exhausted (tapped)  units/heroes.  If your opponent directs his/her attacks at your heroes, knocking them out, you are unable to cast those heroes' spells.  No heroes, no spells.  If your opponent directs his/her attacks at your buildings, they are temporarily knocked offline and you are unable to use them to play units.  Think of the units in Codex as having different rarities, where to summon the most powerful "mythic rares", you need to have incorporated them into your deck, from your Codex, as well as finished constructing a powerful building (Tech III) in order to spend the resources to play them.  Your main base has 20 HP- you lose the game if it reaches zero. Again, you must carefully decide which of your units/heroes will go into your patrol zone in order to keep vulnerable heroes, units or buildings defended. 

REASONS WHY CODEX IS BETTER THAN MTG 
The "mana" resource in Codex is of a single type, gold.  It is used to cast spells, play heroes and units, hire workers to accumulate more gold, construct buildings and sometimes activate abilities.  There is no "mana screw," "forking" or "flooding" here- the resource system is not random.  "Lands" are not drawn from the library.  Gone are the days where you had to shell out hundreds (if not thousands) of dollars to fix the manabase of your deck. You, the player, have total control over your gold income in Codex.  Gone are those games you lost, because you failed to draw a single land from your deck, no matter how many mulligans you took.  Gone are those games you lost, because you drew nothing but lands, while your opponent beat you senseless with their perfect curve.  Although there are other card games like Yu-Gi-Oh and Hearthstone, which did away with random resource mechanics, sometimes those games will punish you with an opening hand that does not contain the proper sequence of cards or mana-curve for optimal gameplay.  Codex requires no mulligans as your starting deck has simple low-costing spells and units to begin with.  There are several different starting decks to choose from, but one of them must match the same color as one of your three heroes.  Depending on whichever combination of three heroes you prefer, they determine which cards are placed in your Codex, prior to the start of a game.      

REASONS WHY MTG IS BETTER THAN CODEX
MTG is an old dinosaur that almost anybody can ride.  Some MTG players have invested tremendous amounts of time and money into their collections, leaving little room to incorporate another card game like Codex.  Believe me when I say this: MTG has left a grand impression that stands to this day.  MTG is arguably less complex than Codex, because a single MTG constructed deck can have a niche and dedicated playstyle, which can be taught in a single focal room (monored burn).   Most optimized decks in MTG are designed to play using one specific and consistent strategy.  It's only a matter of time before that deck's specific archetype is accommodated by the MTG player, resulting in a new deck archetype to be desired.  Codex gravitates to being a more complex game (this said while MTG is already a complex game to begin with), since you have access to several different archetypes within a single faction, which you select and build as the game progresses.  There are so many choices in Codex- a problem I'd rather have than losing the occasional MTG game due to mechanics that were established since the 90s.  This makes Codex an exciting experience with each game I play, because  this is a great way to test many different classical deck archetypes, while discovering new ones that are unique to Codex itself!    

BOTTOM LINE
At the time of this writing, the entire deluxe version of Codex can be yours for the same cost as less than two Tarmogoyfs.  While MTG has more formats, both in limited and constructed form, virtually guaranteeing a playstyle that any niche player could want, it is not accessible.  MTG card staples have spiked harder than ever before, including the fetchlands and manadorks.  For an MTG deck to be even remotely playable, in any of the standard or eternal formats, we know you've got to be prepared to make some costly investments.  We keep doing this because MTG is great at providing that experience of exploration.  MTG provides the thrill of pulling that chase mythic rare, out of all the others.  Even if an MTG player is satisfied with budget options (pauper being probably the best option albeit gutted), being that satisfied loser with a mid/low-tier deck will still not solve those problems that have existed over 20 years ago.  MTG players owe it to themselves to explore a card game that challenges players on a level playing field, where skillful play and strategy are your only advantages.

Have been playing a beta version of this game and am so very, very impressed.  Sirlin wants to wait for a while before revealing more about its mechanics (or I would give some more specific reasons why I love it) but make no mistake: this game is his Magnum Opus and one that I can honestly see myself playing as long as I'm still breathing.

June 2015 Update: Still loving this game.  More details are out and about (Sirlin's Patreon has PNP materials for backers) and the game is just getting better and better.  I have seriously been contemplating getting rid of a lot of my collection (I have the Golden Game Collector microbadge with a personal collection of over 500 games) because it seems like all I want to play is Codex.  Seriously good game, can't wait for the retail version!

February 2016 Update: The Kickstarter is here!  Gameplay examples are available, and details of the systems are out.  I'm still just as impressed with Codex now as I have been.  This is a really special game, and I hope it gets a legitimate chance to shine.

Excellent game, does away with random acquisition through blind packs AND cards that are not even worth using, my two biggest problems with similar card games.

While this will still appeal more to those younger Magic the Gathering-type of gamers, I think this game significantly improves on this genre of game to make it better for the older, more disgruntled and spoiled boardgamer (i.e. me). You won't have to continuously buy cards in order to keep up with the "meta". In fact, this game is complete with no additional content forthcoming. If you buy the six faction decks (plus two neutrals), then you have all the cards possible. Of course, you can stick with one or two decks if you want and still be just as competitive against your opponent(s). 

The theme and art are consistent with the stereotypical faction colors (i.e. Red is aggressive and chaotic, blue is annoying to your opponent, green is nature/animals, black is death and disease, etc.). The components are great in some respects (awesome Codex binders, mousepad material playmats), but lacking in other areas (huge box, lackluster counters, near useless box insert). 

Where this game shines is in the gameplay. Sirlin seems to have made it his goal to improve on Magic and other CCGs, and he has done an excellent job. Income is no longer subject to the randomness of your draw deck. Instead, players earn a set income at the start of their turn. This base income can be increased by "trashing" a card from your hand (to hire a worker) which provide an additional coin of income each future turn. Coins can be saved from turn to turn, so you're not penalized for not using everything immediately. 

Another area that is improved upon is the ability to build your deck as the game progresses, rather than doing so entirely before the match. Pre-game deckbuilding is something I have no desire to do, so I appreciate that this is now part of the game itself. The deckbuilding is interesting though. Unlike Dominion (and its derivatives), you aren't railroaded into certain "buys". Each faction also has 3 specializations in their Codex from which a player can only choose one. This restricts one's choices somewhat (only Tech II and III cards), but also gives your opponent some level of knowledge for how to properly counter you. 

I also like how the Heroes in the game work. You have 3 heroes at your disposal throughout the game, but they don't go into your deck. Besides being necessary to cast spell cards, these heroes also behave like units where they can attack and defend. What this means is that even if you didn't draw any units on a given turn, you always have access to some defense in the form of heroes. Although you'll want to protect them, as the opponent is rewarded for killing them in addition to you not being able to cast spells. They can return, though you have to wait an entire full turn after they die before bringing them back into play.

So far, I've played all the factions except for Purple, but I've not played any one color enough to feel proficient at all. I look forward to many more plays of these as well as trying out the Purple faction. I'm generally past this genre of games, but Codex has changed that feeling. I'm "meh" about Netrunner, but Codex hits the sweet spot. I'm loving Sirlin's games.

A beginner to the game, but an enthusiastic one, and a huge fan of Sirlin's other games.

Codex lives up to its predecessors: Yomi and Puzzle Strike; Sirlin combines the best of a tactical deckbuilding game with the, perhaps, predictability and meta-planning of preconstructed deck games (usually TCGs) such as Magic: The Gathering. 

Super fun. Amazing depth.

This game is going to come out on Kickstarter soon, but I've been playing a beta copy for a while. Codex has one of the most interesting flows of any game I've played - it's a wonderful mixture of Dominion, M:tG, and Warcraft III (yes, the real-time strategy game!). Love it.

(Also, need to give the flavor text a shoutout here because it's really interesting - the Blue cards in particular are a great sinister take on the classic "human law and order faction" archetype.)

It's a shame that Sirlin Games continues its tradition of making awful game boxes/inserts and the tokens provided in the game are terrible at tracking simple things like armor and health buffs, but the game content can't be beat.

As two Euro gamers who do not play these sort of Magic style card combat games we were toally lost trying to learn this.  It took forever and even when we started playing we had to keep looking things up in the rules (which are not that clear).  Nice art but really, other than the art, this game did not work for me.  I don't think it's a bad game - this is really just not a type of game that I'm interest in.

Actually I have the core set. What the heck, BGG.

The "add whichever cards you want from a personal pool" deckbuilding seems straight-up brilliant; it brings in so much of what's fun about deck construction games (e.g. Magic, LCGs) without the fun-ruining choice between spending non-game time building decks (sorry, not gonna, I have other games to play) and playing decks someone else built (fun sometimes but then what's the point?). And it's Sirlin so I'm sure the balance and give-and-take is interesting once you get into. Will I get into it? Stay tuned, etc.

I've played and rated a lot of games over the years, and I've always had a rule that I won't rate a game a "10". There are games that I absolutely love, but nothing that's been *that* close to perfection. Codex, however, is my first "10".

Everything just hangs together so wonderfully. No other game I've played has so completely pushed every other game I own out of my mind. There's just so much opportunity for exploration and creative play that I'm sure it will keep me entertained for years.

My friend bought the kickstarter version of this.  I've played it 3 or 4 times so far and it's pretty fun and innovative from a mechanics stand point.  Starcraft, Magic the Gathering, and Dominion are all games I've loved to play and this kinda mashes those together in a very interesting way.

It's a real shame that some of the themes are so offensive to me.  Due to the themes I will never buy this for myself nor recommend it to others.  For example, the "Truth" faction's cards are all Illusions, so the designer is preaching to the world that truth is an illusion?  Similar problem for law, order, or any other good thing: all warped.  Meanwhile, anarchy and demonology are praised, which I find repulsive.  Some of the factions have inoffensive themes, like the green cards (e.g. Wild, Growth).  The purple faction seems interesting and fun, playing with Time.

RATING: 10
Mixing warcraft RTS style hero control with deckbuilding and combining heroes and tech trees makes for an awesome combination here. Being able to react to what your opponent is playing similar to an RTS on top of the deckbuilding mechanic really works great.

All the different heroes and technologies you can use are all really interesting and once you've moved past the base game to building your own codex of 3 heroes and starting deck the game opens up even more.

As for the deluxe set, the binders are great although it seems the card sleeves from Sirlin Games have a bit of an issue of causing the cards to stick to them if left alone for a while. The playmats are good material and the cards are pretty good quality as well. The tokens are mediocre quality but they're easy to read and are easily replaceable by other tokens if you wish. The box is quite large and won't fit on most popular board game shelves though and if you've put all the cards into the binders the box will no longer close flush as the cards make the binders thicker. While pricey the deluxe set is definitely a great purchase.

RATING: 7
Playtesting Codex, I've probably played it more since the major rule revisions in mid-2015 than any has other person (many 100s of hours).

The underlying structure of this game is innovative--something truly special.  I HOPE that this ends up being an important game.  Codex's innovations offer a lot to the genre.  If you're a game designer, I hope you play this game and learn from it.

That said, IMO it misses opportunities to be even better. I wish the power levels of cards were a lot more equal than they are.  Plenty of cards are just garbage, and not worth the paper they're printed on (beautiful art notwithstanding).  I look forward to subsequent iterations further fulfilling the game's potential.

Great game. I've been playing in beta via Patreon. Lots of strategy and depth due to the way you build your deck on the fly over the course of the game. Even faction has a very distinct flavor. Heck, even a faction's individual heroes are very flavorful!

My only complaint is that while the rules are consistent, it's very easy to miss two overlapping rules due to how much you need to keep track of.

I have been looking for a game like this aa couple of years.
I imvested in Summoner wars but despite that it was good it was missing something significant.
My friends really like ascension , hate star realms btw but both games are significqntly easier than Codex.

I have no background in magic but trying to write down my thought on codex I can understand why that was such a monepit.
I got the deluxe versions n so basicly i am all set until version 2 comes out.

Allthough i don't mind playing this copy in ten uears time.

It is exactly what i was looking for.
I have to get some terminology down but once you get that The game itself is pretty easy to play.
This doesn't mean that there isn't a learning curve.
It is a big one so the downside to this game is that you need equally skilled opponents like in all two player games...

 hoosing your direction when building your tech2  is what makes this a great game instead of a really good one.

Codex: Card-Time Strategy is a customizable, non-collectible card game set in the Fantasy Strike universe that's inspired by real-time strategy video games such as Starcraft and Warcraft 3. Players each control three different heroes and have access to a tech tree that allows them to use different strategies each time they play.

The goal of the game is to destroy the opponent's base. To do this, players build up an army of units and heroes. Players determine the exact composition of their armies as they play by adding cards to their deck based on the tech they've chosen to pursue.

I did the Magic thing in the 90s and a little in the 00s and while it still remains the funnest time I ever had with a game, I've not looked to get back into it. Nor, as I found out a few times, do I really want to get into similar yet not collectible experiences: Netrunner and such tempted me, but I ultimately wasn't interested in building decks and buying cards. 

Codex is the latest in a line of games looking to "fix" Magic and introduce its own spin. It takes the "you have all your cards and choose which ones you add" element and applies it to a somewhat spatial game.

I was wary of this one because of several red flags. First, it claims to be inspired by real-time strategy computer games, a genre I've never liked. Second, it's from Sirlin Games, which I haven't played many of which which for some reason always struck me as having too many things clunkily thrown into the mix. Third, my aforementioned lack of interest in Magic-Killer games.

In practice, it didn't seem particularly real-time to me, so that was a non-issue. However, there are definitely way too many things going on. The base game (and we played the scaled-back intro version) feels like you're well into the third expansion of a game, and playing with all of them at once. There are just a lot of elements that are in there which don't add much except noise.

As I said, we played the baby game, and I'm sure the real game adds a lot more (in fact, it adds a whole lot more, which I'm not sure it needs to.) The thing is, with all its complexities and components, I don't think Codex is a significant improvement over, say, Epic, which also does the Magic-Killing thing in a much more streamlined, accessible, and far cheaper package.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
This is a game for people who love the idea of real time strategy without the pressure of learning a lot of mechanical skills in order to compete at high levels! Also, having access to all of the cards in a CCG is A+ design for a tournament player like myself.

Easily 10/10 game; if you've ever played Magic or Hearthstone and just wish you had more competitive cards without paying a lot of money or being a slave to randomness, definitely check this one out. 

The Kickstarter starts on February 2nd! Check it out!

I think I'll rate this game better the more I play it.   The rules are unbelievably bad.

Honestly, though, at this point I'd still probably play Mage Wars before I played this.

Probably the most successful attempt at a RTS I've seen in board game form, though this definitely feels more like a half-baked Mage Wars clone in execution. In many ways, this is Mage Wars with City of Iron-style deck-building, minus the whole not shuffling thing. It all works and comes together well, but I just wasn't that enthralled by what was going on. It took forever to build up to anything meaningful, and a lot of times it was an arms race to see who could ultimately decimate the other team. This all works with the RTS theme, but I don't know why I'd ever play this over Mage Wars: Academy or even Dice Masters, where you get to the action right away. Granted you don't have the slow buildup in those games, and as a result, strategies can sometimes go out the window as you're having to constantly adjust to trading blows with your opponent. I think this game will be very popular with those who play it, but I have to admit that I'm not a fan of the way they're selling this game. The price they expect for the collector's set is pretty ridiculous, especially for something that is essentially a card game. I think I'll stick with the aforementioned games, as this one feels like it could have used some more streamlining.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
I usually like Sirlin's games, but I really dislike this one. My main issue is the tech 3 cards are far too strong.  In my most recent match, for example, my opponent played two powerful cards together. The first placed a minus rune on every unit I have, and the second kills all of my units with a minus rune, so *everything* is dead. All of that time buying units and setting up my defense was a complete waste because he has two cards that kill them all regardless of my teams defenses and abilities, and with no consequence to him. Ridiculous!

But I don't want you to think I dislike this game because I'm bad at it, or that I just can't be bothered to defend myself from this attack by destroying his tech 3 building. What I hate is the *feel* of the game. This is not a short game. Before tech 3, progress is slow. We slowly pick off each others defenses and attack the home base. When tech 3 is introduced, everything is chaos. I feel like I spent ages building a wall around a castle and then we both discover nuclear weaponry. The events before tech 3 is introduced just feel completely inconsequential. I feel like I wasted my time playing the first 75% of this game.

Not recommended. Play Yomi instead.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It's hardly a secret for anyone who reads my board game comments that I've not been soft with anything made by David Sirlin. My broad opinion up to that point has been that he's good at winning at versus fighting video games (his area of expertise) and excellent at self-marketing, notably by having a significant chunk of his promotion done by his fanbase (whose arguments read like a copy-pasting of their idol's blog notes about why what he does is awesome, why high level play is the best and how casual playtesters like themselves are often wrong). In short, I think he is probably a very good board game balancer, but designer? I've played four of his previous releases, I stand by my ratings about those titles and have no intention to revisit them.

However.

I've kept feeling that if you except the focus on the highest level of play (and Genzoman's depiction of women), I am Sirlin Games' theoretical target audience; and a customisable deckbuilder with Hearthstonish rules trying to emulate RTS video games sounds like a dream pitch made just for me. It also sounds like the typical overcomplicated post-purchase disaster reality that Fantasy Flight Games has spent a decade burning me out with.

Long story short, Codex turned out to be good. Not the second coming of Jesus Christ, not the CCG slayer that been prophecised, more of a better deckbuilder-with-combat than Puzzle Strike was. My quibbles with it:

- I wouldn't dare to say it's more accessible than say Yomi, because the billion ideas mashed together that constitute Codex are ones I happen to be already familiar with.
- I can't assess the game's balance at this stage, but if anything needs fixing, a second edition will surely be out before I break the game.
- I'm not sure heroes feel powerful enough for their levelling cost, which I only end up paying when I can capitalise on the healing effect.
- Higher tech units obsoleting lower tech units rather than only giving access to new tools feels like a missed opportunity. So new workers unfortunately come down to hoping you have drawn an early game card to dump.
- The efficiency of being able to curve out and play your biggest card each turn is already a design problem faced by every other "mana cost" based CCG. And the card drawing phase of Codex, rewarding having played the lowest amount of cards, makes curving out situations even more powerful.
- Most tech 3 creatures have a wall of abilities that basically condense to "at the beginning of the next turn, if this is still alive, win the game". Which is not only rather unexciting on paper, but an unwelcome jester box in the otherwise slow buildup that is the rest of the game, with the sudden urgency that it must now end because we have a playtime to benchmark.
- Faction colours seem to be a big deal on paper, but their only impact is to help you not slightly overpay for spell cards you want to get rid of ASAP anyway and a measly 1 gold for your first tech building (which won't exactly put you a turn late since you can already deckbuild higher tech cards from turn 1). In other words, although there are sometimes mild synergies between your starting deck and upper tech paths of the same faction, the incentive to play multiple heroes of the same faction (rather than disregarding colours) is close to null.
- The patrol zone bonuses feel a bit autopicky. I suspect what happened is that the patrol zone became a thing, then the patrol zone got its own patrol zone in the form of the squad leader, then a test playboard was printed and someone went "Hey, there's a lot of empty space here. Let's fill it before our game becomes disturbingly readable."
- The thing with CCGs is that if we except weird interactions, most the rules are written on the cards themselves. Codex not only features a board filled with text, but also a lot of easy-to-forget lines in its rulebook: casting limitations for different types of spells, healing upon levelling thresholds, extra one time tier 1 cost for a multicoloured Codex, heroes levelling as a trigger, how many levels they gain and who decides which one, how generic buildings damage the base for how much when destroyed, how rebuilding a lost tech building is different from building it the first time, when you can resummon a lost hero, etc.
- On the other hand, the game's rulebook, assuming each player has prepared their Codex in advance for tournament play, doesn't bother to provide even a basic method for hero selection if you're 2-5 players using a single box, especially since there is only one copy of each faction's starting deck.
- Although Codex is primarily a 2-player game, the folded paper sheets that come for extra players in the collector's edition are a bit atrocious. I don't know what type of board you get for 2 players in less expensive versions, but you'd better investigate before buying because dedicated playmats are a significant extra expense.

Will I still like the game in 10 years? Who knows. But the fact is that despite my complaints, when my 60+ board game collection gets its circa 2017 pruning, Codex will probably make the cut. Consequently as far as I'm concerned and despite all the flak he's taken from far more vocal people than me, Sirlin has kept working and guess what: designing enough games made him a better game designer. Which I tip my virtual fedora to.

An excellently designed game that is quite deep. I enjoy playing and thinking about it, but it is difficult to teach new people and even more difficult to play well.

A year later: This game is still fun but it is not easy to play and even worse, it is difficult to play after you've played other games for a while. Still a noble effort in trying to make a CCG that is self-contained. I wish I had only bought the starter set.

I have played 4 times. The game is really hard to learn and takes a lot of time if you're not used to your faction (3 hours per game seems common). That's the price to pay for an enormous strategic depth. One of the best game of 2016, but it's not for everyone.

Codex is a nice mix of Mage Wars and Magic the Gathering mechanically and provides a nice variation of the heard to heard card sorcery genre.  I think very highly of this game though I do not quite see it as a Magic the Gathering killer, more of a substitute for occasional play.

 This is the most well thought and rich in strategy, theme and tactics card game of them all. You don't bother building a deck, you just choose any 3 heroes you want, take their cards and start the battle.

The crowning achievement of the board/card gaming hobby! Finally, a game that has thoroughly trounced the reigning champion (M:tG) and taken it's due spoils as the best game ever made (in my not-so-humble opinion)!

I honestly can't think of anything this game could do better. The art is gorgeous, the rules are simple to learn yet allow for deep strategizing, the game takes around an hour or less to play (with two people), turns are short enough that nobody should get bored (unless the other player has AP), and the factions and specs all seem to be superbly balanced. After numerous plays with and against each faction and spec, I have yet to encounter one that seemed unequivocally better than another.

In other words, if you have even a passing interest in competitive card games and especially if you have ever been a fan of M:tG, you owe it to yourself to at least try this game. But be warned: You should be prepared to fall in love with Codex and want to play it every chance you get for quite some time!

RATING: 10
A few players in my group have this. Really hoping it takes off. 

There are a few things about this game that really stand out to me. I like the resource system. Choosing a card each turn as a worker is a great way to build income because it involves a choice. Games like Magic where you are screwed based on what you draw instead of what choices you make are frustrating at best, and outdated in my opinion.

I also like how the Codex itself plays out and how you gradually build the deck as the game goes on. It replicates the fog of war element from an RTS where a player who correctly guesses what his opponent might do will get an advantage.

I think the combat system in this game is brilliant. Being able to set up your defense in advance is an elegant solution to something that is usually very convoluted in combat games. Well done.

Been following Sirlin games and the development of this for a long time.  Very fun and deep game, with hard decisions from turn 1.  There's a great community building around this and I can't wait for the kickstarter and eventual online implementation.

I've been playing the beta of this through supporting Sirlin on Patreon and it's a smash with my boardgame buddies.

This is essentially a boardgames version of playing Warcraft 3. If you like classic pc rts games you'll love this game.  Only complaint is a small balance update could be done, though current meta does have a reasonable  amount of variety.

DISCLAIMER: I do not own the Deluxe box, but I do own just about everything in it. The game is everything I like about magic without everything I don't. I feel like this game could grow into something incredible if it had a community equivalent of its worth. It's really really dumb that BGG's Geek rating of this is lower than 6.5

Wow, this game... just wow. 

This might end up being a 9 for me, but for now this game is near everything I'd want from a 2p game. The only thing I don't like is the art on the hero cards that's weirdly out of whack with the rest of the game and is ten times lower quality. That's a pretty petty thing to worry about, when the game is so awesome.

Played the PnP version: A bit meh. 

It's just another combat oriented deckbuilder (I think there are other better ones out there). Granted, the deck building is done in a slightly different way than any other. 

Game play is very reminiscent of MTG. 

I'd play it, but I doubt I'd ever be inclined to buy it.

Definitely better than the PnP version. 

Of all the 2p tactical fantasy battle games (MtG, Mage Wars, Pixel Tactics, etc), this is probably the best. That said, I wouldn't say it's great. But these kinds of games aren't really my style.

I love this game. Playing with my friends that like hearthstone, magic, and/or starcraft. They like this more because the entire collection of cards is available and the strategies are real time and not predetermined by deck choice. First game that I've played that's incorporated real time strategy in a card game (card time strategy is the description that the author uses).

RATING: 8
What it does, it does well--the feel of a CCG without the collecting fuss. There's certainly some depth here, and various means to adapt and subvert your opponents present tactics. The first play experience was not particularly exciting, though it was fun. The tension will likely increase, and thus make play experience feel more engaging, once me and my playing partner become more proficient at utilizing the system.

RATING: 6
rating based on a prototype play with the designer (from about 2011).  I may be way out of date.

the game was neat, but possibly too complex for the level of luck ultimately present

the deck building is neat, but overwhelming and hard to remember everything you brought and thus could use on a given turn.

the mechanics were solid, but unapologetically culling the 'best' of MTG, which I found sometimes a healthy revisit and sometimes a boring repeat of a game I had already tired of.

overall I appreciated the design, am curious about how it plays out, but doubt I will sink the time into it unless people I trust tell me the payoff is there down the road.

RATING: 7
The artwork and character choices are underwhelming, but the game itself is fun. Somewhere between magic and mage wars (but no, not similar to mage wars academy). Since I have them both, I don't know if I would want to invest in this one now, though
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Played twice, via print and play. Excellent, intuitive flow combined with fascinating card interplay, at least in the decks we tried. My only reservation is that it requires multiple plays to really gain all the knowledge required for truly strategic play, and I'm not sure I have the stamina required. But that's less a flaw of the game, and more of a challenge for me.

RATING: 3
I'm not against games that are bluntly based on others, as long as they improve any aspect of those existing ones. But Codex doesn't because it takes on average longer than the others (perhaps not Mage Wars) and doesn't add any new strategies. It all boils down to who is able to get the most powerful card in play, preferably a Level III, and not much happens before that. It is also frustrating to see how many unbalanced cards are, feels like playing MagicTG back in the day only with beta, when choosing a colour, you know which cards you are going for regardless. Lastly, the poorly written rules do not help much during games, leaving both players upset for this flagrant deficiency.

RATING: 7
(first pass rating) A good blend of old systems; perhaps too many edge cases (but then that's the point of a combo game!)  The current range of deck types seems good, with each "colour" clearly having a number of different and distinct strategies.  As others have noted, this is a game in which a serious disparity between the players will likely be not fun for the less-good player; the question is whether or not it can keep that less-good player interested enough to improve.
(In passing, I will note that I misunderstood the combat system quite badly and, as a result, found it a lot less interesting than I thought it was.  There may still be wrinkles I don't quite get, but my feeling was that the innovative patrol idea was undermined by the rest of it.)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Codex is an interesting take on the dueling card game genre. Strategically it plays more like a turn based version of an RTS game than a traditional dueling game in many ways. In particular, board dominance is king. There are a bunch of other rules of thumb like you want to maintain a full hand and play a worker every turn until you have 10, but if one player secures complete board dominance, they will win by locking their opponent out of their best options. Codex's mechanics are much better than Magic or Hearthstone, although it has a bit of a learning curve before you can play competently.

At the same time, Codex does a lot to make it easier to get into the game. To start, you can just choose a color and play with those 3 heroes. Within that game, you only need to consider the tech 1 options and/or spells for your first tech choices, and the tech 2 options a little bit later. This information throttling makes it easier to learn the game, even though the game is quite complex.

The art and theme are silly, and I would prefer a more serious aesthetic, but I care more about the mechanics than the quality of the art.

The rules are not always as clear as I would like. The designer has said that he prefers to write the rules in a way that is easy to understand, even if it doesn't cover every case. I can see the value in that for teaching the game, but I prefer to have rules that cover every situation clearly, and are precise. In a number of cases the rules are misleading or needlessly confusing. These are mostly edge cases, and there will eventually be a more precise rule document to deal with this issue, but it's a little annoying.

I also wish the relative strengths of cards within the same bracket were closer in some cases, although often this is counterbalanced by the other strengths of the spec. For example, Anarchy's tech 2 options are not particularly exciting compared to other tech 2 plans, but it has the best tech 3 in the game.

By making the decks modular, there is room to explore different builds, archetypes, and synergies, but it keeps those decisions from boiling down into minutiae. I don't really care that much whether I run a 3 or 4 Dispels in Mage Wars, and Codex avoids that kind of decision.

The decision space in Codex is large, and you make many more decisions on your turn than in most other dueling games. I like the way you build your deck as you play, since it allows you to tailor your strategy and deck composition to the matchup and what your opponent is doing. 

I like the way that the patrol zone works. It allows you to make defensive decisions on your turn, and invites your opponent to find weaknesses in your choices. It's a nice refinement over Hearthstone.

RATING: 10
This is David Sirlin's magnum opus. Codex is a seamless blend of Magic, Starcraft, and Dominion, and I just can't get enough of it. This game tugs at all the same strings that Magic did back in my sleepless university days, but it improves upon the formula in all the right places. 

In Codex, all of the match-ups are balanced, which sounds like marketing speak, but really it's the single most important feature of the game. Gone are the days where we play the same MTG match-up 10 times, only to discover that the win rate of a particular deck in the match-up is 4:1, no matter who is playing it. It's not that the other deck is even bad, but it fairs better against other types of decks. The solution was either we play different decks or tweak that deck with the sideboard. In short, our experience meant that we would just endlessly cycle through decks in a never-ending search for the ever-elusive perfect match-up. In Codex, we simply pick a color based on mood and go. Want that feeling of craftiness and customization? Jumble the colors any way you want, mix and matching the 20 heroes roughly 4000 unique 'decks' (which is called a codex, incidentally).

Codex is fast turning into my favourite game of all time, dethroning the mighty Cosmic Encounter. I bought the Codex Deluxe set and don't have to worry about buying more cards. This is a complete game, and damned fine one at that. I've been searching for a card game like Codex for well over a decade. Search over. Play Codex.

As a 20 year MTG player, this game now replaces it. A clever design allows almost unlimited replayability and the diversity in the colours, and options makes for interesting matchups. 

From my experience so far, each colour looks overpowered on the surface of it, but plays out in a very balanced way once you get deeper.

The game could benefit from some wording templating as used in Magic:TG, but the codexcarddb.com goes some way to fixing that by providing a living reference for the players to consult.

A solid 10 from me.

RATING: 10
Super fun game. The only possible pitfall I could see it running into is undiscovered future balance issues since the game has a lot of working pieces. This game has relatively low luck factor, so the balance will need to be very tight. At the level of play I'm at though, the game seems quite balanced, I feel like I have an abundance of "real" options, and I am rewarded for predicting my opponents intentions and reactive play. 

I put emphasis on reactive play and predicting your opponents because in traditional CCG's (Magic etc.) your decks pretty much have predetermined strategies. If you lose to an opponent or deck, you'd rather change your deck than change your strategy. In Codex you change your strategy.

And the fact that this game is not being flooded with cards and expansions (and never will be) unlike FFG LCGs and stuff is a bonus for me too. This game doesn't overcompensate for lack of long-term depth with endless card pools that make the game unapproachable for beginners and a nightmare for deck builders. It's designed for THIS product to be complete -- you won't have to worry about some new card changing the game every month before you even got to learn the last set.

On the downside, figuring out the right moves and combat in general is a bit mathy. I wish there were some sort of mind game aspect ala Netrunner. But same could be said for most similar games, and there are at least mind games in choosing your tech options.

[b]Recommended for:[/b] People who want a deep 2 player game they can play over and over again. If you like the concept of FFG LCGs etc but don't want to keep up with never ending card pools, this might be the game you're looking for. I was really into Android: Netrunner for a while because I liked how much your in-game decisions mattered. This game will pretty much put Netrunner to rest for me though because it will have a stable metagame that I can explore.

(5 Design + 5 Enjoyment)

RATING: 7
This is a 2-player battling mages game that likes to consider itself a real-time strategy card game.  That claim is somewhat loosely made.  You can "build" buildings and upgrade your level and heroes, but for the most part this isn't much different than other battling mages games.  Each player's base has 20 HP and your goal is to reduce your opponent's to 0.  You do this by playing units to attack, spells, buildings, and upgrades.

Your deck is very similar to that in Mage Wars, you have access to your whole library from the start.  Although you can only play the cards that you have upgraded to the tech level for and specialize in.  This makes it a little unique as well as the patrol mechanic.  You can select the target of any attack except each player has a patrol zone and a patrol leader.  The patrol leader needs to always be removed first, then any other unit in the patrol zone before you can choose another target.  Each patrol zone slot also provides a bonus such as bonus attack or armor.  I like this a lot and it gives it a different flavor than the same old mage battler.

The art is pretty good and ranges from action-packed to silly (one card has a giant panda shooting a rainbow out of its mouth).  The quality leaves something to be desired considering the cost.  The cards and spellbooks are fine but everything else is cheap cardboard tokens.  And without buying one of the complete collections whether at once (I bought the deluxe version which includes everything) or piecemeal by acquiring the expansions the amount of content might wear thin.  Even with everything considering the price other games offer a lot more for a much better deal (like the aforementioned Mage Wars).  So this is a hard one to recommend if you don't already have it, even though I enjoy it now that I do own it.

Out of the box: Wow, is this a steep learning curve for me, never having played Magic etc. But it's not daunting--it's fun, and the fantastic art and flavor text help tease you into the depths. I want to love this game, and so far, that's working out, as we finally work out the concepts of the game and start our first play-through.

A few plays: Still fun, but with my wife, whoever plays Green beats Red, easily. (We only have core set so far.) I would have to conclude at this point that there's a balance problem between these two decks. Not sure if that's a huge problem, but it does seem to be true.

A few more plays: We have overcome the red/green balance problem, and we bought the rest of the decks--we like this game VERY much. 

More plays: Yes, we love this game, this is our little venture into Ameritrash-style card combat, and it is great. We'll be playing this for a long time.

Opening this game up is like a combination of the dice masters player sheet and the spell books from Mage Wars. Having a card book to pick from brought me back to my youth collecting sports cards, which had me excited to give it a go.

I wanted to like it more than I did, but the game just fell flat for me. I'm more into realistic themed games compared to fantasy so it already had that against it, and there's just so many other games I'd prefer to play that are similar in style.

For a fighting and hand management game BattleCON for me is miles ahead of this one. It also had a Pixel Tactics feel placing your units into the front row and the different abilities of the leaders.

I wanted to give the game another shot, but my friend and I just couldn't muster enough excitement from our first game to bother.

After playing the PnP starters (Finesse vs Bashing), I am hooked. There is an interesting depth of gameplay here, and the asynchronous play is well implemented. Plenty of choices to make, and the "on-the-fly" deckbuilding is such an improvement in strategic play. Instead of having to include counter cards in your deck (ala Magic or Netrunner), you can cycle them into your deck during the game. This is a brilliant nod to the strategic play of a RTS game, and a clever mechanic in itself (much better than the pick two cards for this turn of Mage Wars). Super excited for the full game and the rest of the colors - I am in for a deluxe set.

2016-11
The full deluxe game is even more impressive. Mono-color decks are quite, but they is even more depth in combining decks to make awesome new strategies.

What a great system for those that like CCG style play, but dislike the expanse and time commitment of collecting and deck building. The game itself plays like a pretty straight-forward Magic/Warcraft TCG clone, but the wrinkle is in the deck building. A standard match consists of a battle between three heroes on each side...and each hero comes with their own deck of cards. To build a deck, players simply select three heroes and combine the three sets of cards.

You don't shuffle up and draw blind though. In yet another twist, gameplay is almost more of a cross between Dominion and Mage Wars, than Magic. Each turn players will go through their "constructed deck" and select two cards to add to their play deck, which they use to refill their hand each turn. This allows players to have a toolkit, and they can adjust on the fly to whatever their opponents are doing, albeit with a one or two turn delay. This makes for a great game of cat and mouse between experienced players, and for a whole lot of discovery for newbies.

Supposedly this is a one-shot, so if you have been dreaming of the Magic the Gathering experience without the huge buy-in, you might want to give Codex a good hard look. I know I am.

I struggled with this rating. The BGG rating is very high and Tom Vassal gave it a great review. I was looking forward to trying it and considered picking up a copy prior to playing it due to the RTS-theme. I grew up playing Warcraft, Command and Conquer, Starcraft, and a number of other RTS clones. 

My rating is based on the 2P kit. I really struggled to rate this as it isn't a bad game per se, but it definitely wasn't for me. I can see the allure of an RTS-based, LCG-esque game. While it wasn't a long game, I felt it went on much longer than it needed to. I didn't feel the decisions were interesting as my cards were always highly constrained. Granted, we could have done a better job of building upgrades or using patrols to further increase card advantage.

While my rating is pretty low, this isn't a bad game. The artwork is nice and there appears to be clear variation between asymmetric factions. It's just outshined by a vast ocean of games I enjoy much better. For the $100+ it would take to buy a full set, I'd enjoy something like Star Wars: Destiny much more. However, because I'm such a "Cult of the New" fan (2,246 recorded plays on BGG, 917 unique games), the replayability of something like this (or most xCG/xDGs) doesn't really appeal to me.  

Again, while it isn't a bad game, I'd much rather "roll the dice" on something brand new or go back to a favorite. Were the game shorter and easier to teach, I may have boosted the rating slightly.

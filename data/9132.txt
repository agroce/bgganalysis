An enormous system that constantly keeps you entertained with thinking about the current state and future of a lot of companies you control, and how they will interact with the several dozen other companies that the other players have. Like most 18xx games you constantly are on the ball and this continues for the whole 10-12 hours! There is nothing quite like it, a truly epic experience. I burned out a little after 3 games in the space of 4 weeks but I'm feeling the urge to play it again.

Update: The living rules are not really working anymore, feels like they can't be bothered with it anymore and a small rule change in a long game can be quite tricky. We discussed some variations in our group and if we play it again we'd probably try to incorporate some tweaks to better suit us.

Too long to really be enjoyable -- the spectacle is entertaining, but I am not sure there is that much more game here than in a much shorter 18xx title.

I've played this gigantic game by e-mail and in my vision, this the only way to play it. We started the privates and first 2 rounds at the table. The game is epic and very much fun. It isn't that complicated and stays fun untill the forming of the conrail. From then on, the game can't be finished fast enough. That's the reason I will probably never play this game live.

But how I loved the gameplay. A lot of companies, the important destination cities, the tokens to block other players and the need to merge. It seems to me that bankruptcy is difficult and there are enough companies too change the strategies.

The granddaddy of them all. A HUGE map, a LONG game, usually decided long before it actually ends. Still, an enjoyable game.

I'm a large fan of the merging companies.  In one game, this was enabled quickly, and the game ran much faster as a result.  In the second, this stalled, and so did the game.

I'm a big fan of 2-hour long stock rounds, but the latter experience resulted in several 2-hour long ORs, which I do mind.

Would be higher if it weren't for this potential problem to prop up again.

What a sprawling giant!  This is 18XX with a severe case of gigantism and no sense of subtlety.  It is about as vegetarian as a side of beef to the face.

I like this behemouth.  The basic pattern is akin to climbing onto a rocket, lighting the touch paper and then mid-flight climbing from rocket to ever bigger rocket to yet bigger rocket.  This is a big, even vast, money game.  Money flows in torrents and deluges.  Companies spring up like daisies, lots of them, and then lots more.  Don't be surprised to find yourself running half a dozen or even a dozen different companies by the end of the game.  Yeah, that many.  The rest of the game is similarly scaled.

Update: Like so many Bill Dixon games, it is fascinating on up through the 5-trains and into the 6-trains.  Sadly there are many layers of trains left, but little game value left at that point.

Updated from my geeklist: 

In more than a few ways 18C2C is 1870 struck with incurable gigantism, hyper-inflation and an excess of late night television (but wait, there's more!). The map covers the entire continental USA along with portions of southern Canada, and will occupy two to three entire tables when setup. As might be expected, the east is dense, the west open and expensive and the middle (ie the strip running south of Chicago) rather lucrative. 18 private companies are auctioned in a double-track 1830-style private auction (rather difficult to manage and surprisingly clever). The private companies are much like the private companies in 1870 with many little bonus tokens or other tweaks that may be placed or sold to other companies. 32 major companies. The major companies can merge in pairs later in the game allowing for more facile trains shuffling (trains more freely between the sub-companies, and a sub-company may be forced to buy a train while the other half runs trains, pays and moves the stock up). 2 yellows per turn. Late in the game two additional companies enter the fray (because there are clearly not enough companies in the game): the ConPac and Union Pacific. They absorb the lame-duck companies. 1870-style destination runs with bull tokens for the destination locations. Train roster is 1870-style: 2/3/4/5/6/8/10/12. With the default train roster the 2-trains usually run for ~5 ORS. Local feeling (with which I agree) is that there are far too many 2-trains and 3-trains in the default game and we remove a handful of each. With the reduced train roster the train rush is steady and pleasingly fast without being brutal.

This is a game which simply shoves money at the players, and shoves money with great speed. In a 4-player or 5-player game each player will start 2-3 companies in the first stock round, and 1-2 more companies in every subsequent stock-round starting with the 3rd. Cash is delivered by fire-hose. The problem is never not having enough money. The problem is investing the money wisely. This is a Run-Good-Companies game and makes no bones about it. However single companies are weak. The key is to run good pairs of companies, almost 18EU-style, and to set them up for well-times mergers and destination runs. Much like the other games with destination runs, you want to destinate either early (for the cash boost) or late (when you have lots of trains and great runs, for the huge cash boost and stock-appreciation). All the rest of the game is a straight-forward charge for the biggest and fastest money fire-hose. Like 1870, there is a lot of money to be made with late-game good 12-train runs. I'm not sure that the late game big-runs are as glaringly strong as they can be in 1870, but they can be pretty impressive none the less.

We play 18C2C every year at KublaCon. We've never finished the game. We start around 10:30 in the morning and play until around 02:00 in the morning the next day and then call the game and crawl into bed arguing over who would have won had we played through. By the time we call the game we're usually into the 8-trains, maybe the 10-trains. Another 2-3 hours would see us through the 12-trains and looking for the end of the game, but we've never bothered. 15-16 hours of non-stop 18C2C at a stretch is enough.

Overall Rating: 8
Rating with 2 players: 5
Rating with 3 Players: 6
Rating with 4 Players: 8
Rating with 5 Players: 7.5
Rating with 6 players: 4
Rating with more players: 5

ObNote: Most of the ratings variance is simply due to downtime and personal overhead with larger player counts, and personal overwhelm with smaller player counts. Starting 5 companies out of the gate with 3 players and then adding 1-2 every stock round is a wee bit much for little me.

A monster in the truest sense of monster, bigger than big, i this the largest game ever? How does it play, the answer is slowly and all actions need to be taken to speed this up. I would suggest people on hand out cash at the end of the operating rounds. Just calculate the yield pershare each round. I think this game is good and tackles a difficult aspect that of monstrous size of the usa. To rate it I need to play again at least a couple of times.

RATING: 7
With some trains removed I think this has the potential to be an 8 or 9, but the game as written has way too many trains.  The train rush is just too gentle, and as a result the player whose companies get the most 3 trains has a huge advantage.

The good: destinations, wide variety of companies, some interesting minors, potential for absolutely monster routes

The bad: too many trains, mergers are fairly inelegant, east coast companies are much stronger than west coast, train runs can take an extremely long time to calculate in the mid game.

There's nothing about an 18xx game that provides me any form of enjoyment, and so the prospect of spending another three hours(at minimum) per session at least half a dozen more times just to progress past the conscious incompetence stage is unappealing. The strategies and tactics of this genre will forever remain opaque to me.

Wow, it's not just a gimmick! The gameplay is actually pretty interesting with the merger synergies. Can't imagine ever playing the original variant, route calculation is sufficiently annoying even in the D variant.

This is probably the most epic 18xx game I have ever played. But this is also a two edged sword since it take such a long time to finish the game. My first game session took us 18 hours to finish. This is at some extent too much for me. But overall the game was fun and I recommend it to any 18xx fans out there 

Ps. Just try to play the game in multiple sessions and not in one sitting.

An enormous 18XX I would probably never play in person, but which works great on rr18xx.com. Most important characteristics are the mergers (once two companies are connected they can merge). Then there are also two nationalizations: Amtrak and Conrail form from companies that are left with no trains when the 3Ts and 4Ts are out. Going bankrupt is definitely not a concern for this game, as money flows in copious amounts. I'm still terrible playing it, though.

For the record, even though 18C2C is far bigger than 1856, we took 26 days to finish a game on rr18xx, while playing 1856 using rails took us four months.

This is currently my favorite 18xx game.  Everything you love about 18xx games: mergers, public companies, train rushes, stock takeovers, et cetera are here.  This game is easiest played with cyberboard, but I do have a CD with printable components - haven't got around to making this one yet though.

One caveat: This is a long, exhausting, & somewhat brutal game.  If you play it online make sure you have a good group or it will get stuck in the late stages of the game.

A major event to play.  Nothing really different in gameplay but the scale is magnificent.  A limit of 64 certificates?  Thirty or so companies?  Really enjoyed the 'feel' of the game and the huge map.

RATING: 7.5
This takes the money-multiplying factor of most 18xx games and nearly exponentiates it, on an enormous scale. I can't imagine playing this more than once a year or two. I do wonder how this would play out with 8 or 10 players, though. (I suspect it would become far too cutthroat, and geographical proximity would drive too much of gameplay.)

RATING: 3
Not a good game to play if you suffer from back trouble. The map is VERY big. I'd rate this a 6, but being among those with a back problem I find that I am limited to operating only those corporations that are within arm's reach of my seat.

If you really want to play a full USA 18XX then try 1862 or 18US.

An epic masterpiece. It takes enormous amount of time to play - our first game took 18 hours (not counting the breaks), but I enjoyed every minute of it. Even though there was lots of downtime, I did not mind it as I had lot of exciting planning to do in that time.

Really fun and definitely 18xx to excess.  I don't think I will get to play this too many times because of the length but I look forward to each playing.  I love JC's comment about climbing onto the rocket and setting it on fire and then climbing onto a bigger rocket. 

I would have to say that there is a lot going on.  It's kind of like 3 18xx games that you are playing all at the same time; it runs about the same number of SR/OR's as any other game but 3 times as many companies get operated and you lay A LOT of track.  It's hard enough to keep my own plans in order and I realized after last game that I really wasn't paying attention to what others were doing.  (ie. the number of companies that everyone else lost into the ConRail surprised me; in a smaller game I would be more aware of what trains each company had, but the players physically sit far apart and there is 16-20+ companies running at the same time.) 2010/04/26

Love the idea of it but hard to get a group to be able to play it more than one night.

Always would have to play some one by proxy and that is no fun after the showed up to start it but not finish it.

Good 18xx but not a chance I would play on the table. Route calculating toward the end of the game would be nightmarish without computer help due to the 1830ish tile mix. Something tells me the simplified tiles used in 18OE are much more manageable at this scale.

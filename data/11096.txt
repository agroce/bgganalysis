Combines some railroad building type mechanics with empire building and adds some novel ideas with the play of Sun Cards to an unusual theme. Not sure yet if the strategic elements are offset by the chaos of the Sun cards

RATING: 8
Network-building game with strong elements of opportunism, in that players want to connect to the cities and garrisons built by the other players to score points for their work. Working on cutting people out of segments of the network, thereby denying them such opportunities, is often where the game is at, but it can be difficult to achieve without collusion. The "sun" cards are used in a novel fashion in that they are placed between two players, affecting only them, and are probably my favorite part of the game. Highly interactive.

Clever systems of balance ensure that the leader can be caught in a short time. Timing of options that are available through the Sun cards is crucial. Well balanced game with many routes to scoring victory points within a scripted sequence of play. The game system is well contructed and the components are reasonable.

An interesting network building game with well-worked Incan theming.  I particularly like the event cards, played between two players and effecting both.  The greater concentration of sites in the north does prompt concerns about balance when playing with four (one player is heading south at the start). Production quality could of course be better.  I cover the board with a sheet of acetate and use water soluble pens.

Pretty good.  Well thought out and for the most part balanced.  Also, does a good job at keeping people in the game.

My one complaint is the Wilderness Road cards.  There's either too many of them, or they shouldn't be allowed to let a person build multiple Wilderness roads.  I think they really hurt the game.

- The rulebook is a mess. You need to come to bgg to understand what the cards do.

Intriguing crayon-rail game with a great power card sharing mechanic. I'm a bit concerned by the power of the Pilgrimmage cards although they do allow trailing players to get back into the mix. The board also seems a bit imbalanced (potentially). But after my first play, I was sufficiently impressed and would gladly play it again.

This game is an empirebuilding game which plays like a traingame. Interesting are the sun events that influence the game a lot. Minor point is the crayon system, because it is not very clear and it destroys the gameboard. So I am very happy it will be re-realised as Inca Empire.

I'd prefer to refer to Tahuantinsuyu, as "The Rise of the Inca Empire ," for it sticks more in my brain.  Unfortunately, I grew pretty tired of the Incas and I wish that the game would end a few rounds earlier.  On a positive note, I did enjoy the card play in which a player places a face down card in-between two players.  I'm not sure if I have ever encountered that mechanism.

Alan was at UberConVII to help us learn this game. He was very helpful, which is a plus for the game. I am glad to hear that they have only 200 copies left of the 1000 prints and they made a profit a second year in a row! The game plays well but the board is a bit too small and tight for my taste. I made osme fatal errors (before Alan came over to offer ushis help) that made a comeback impossible. Wilderness road card and the pilgrimage cards were what made the winner in the end. One has to use those very wisely to expand in both north and south directions. It helps to get them towards the middle of the game where they ar ein effect for a few people phases.

A hybrid crayon rail/empire builder game, where unlike some similar games (looking at _you_, Powergrid) you want to be near your neighbor to take advantage of his builds.  Docked it a .5 due to the map - for a game that needs so much stuff on it (region tokens, building markers, etc), a thick paper map with numerous creases and humps just doesn't cut it.

Played for the first time and was really impressed by this game.  There are a lot of positives that helped me push the score up to an 8.  First off, the rules are 4 pages (although pretty dense type).  The theme really feels appropriate.  You really feel like you are in an empire expanding outwards.  The balancing mechanism works very well.  Even though there were some big leads in our game, the final score was 112, 111, 110, 109.

7/8/08 - No. 93 - math traded Vinci in 36 hour trading extravaganza math trade to get this. Looking forward to playing this game - sounds interesting.

Update: 4er game. We played that the sun event cards stayed for one turn only. Really enjoyed the game inspite of some event cards which do seem a bit overpowered. It is worth noting that the player who won had the effect of the pilgrimmage card twice. If it wasn't for two events cards played on either side of me before I could play my garrison card to build two garrisons in one turn I would have had the slim victory. I did earn the effect of the pilgrimmage card once during the game. Want to play again.

While it may look like a train game at first glance, it's actually a rather intriguing empire building game. You conquer territory, build cities and temples, and construct a road network to link up with other cities in the area.  It's a bit like a board game version of the Civilization computer game.  The card playing mechanic is clever: cards get played between two players and affect both of them, so you have to decide whether helping yourself is worth giving one of your opponents a boost.

RATING: 7.5
While not without flaws but both interesting and rather deeper than it first appears.  This is very much a game of riding coattails and of (not-always-so-)minor positional advantages.  

A pleasant, even somewhat soothing game.

The flaws are easily isolated: The "Rural Unrest" cards are excessively capricious and the random game-ending forces jarringly tactical short term considerations into an otherwise fine planning game.  Both may be removed easily enough.

Update: 5 games in and it has been growing one me.  Rating raised half a point to 8.  For all the random caprice in the card draws, card plays and road building, there's an even larger dose of subtlety and inferential control play.

Update: 10 games in.  There's no need to tolerate the random ending.  Just toss the discs and always have the last epoch have 4 Sun/People phases.

One play.  Wow, this was a long game.  Perhaps it was an anomoly but it took four players nearly five hours.  It's not because it was complicated.  And it was fun!   There were some great challenges and I found myself having to think on my feet a lot which was good considering there was a fair bit of downtime ... but frankly if I'm going to play a five hour game I'd rather play Die Macher.  Or heck, even Twilight Impirium.  In fact, at the other table they played a game of Indonesia [i]and[/i] a game of Age of Steam in the time it took us to play one game of this!  And while I enjoyed this game I like those two much better and would rather have been at that table.  Would be willing to try this again sometime under the right circumstances, but it'd have to come in a lot shorter for me to raise the rating more than a point.

I kinda like nice components, which this doesn't have, but the underlying game is good. We weren't super fond of the cards which gave large vp to those connected to significant temples, but other than that it all seemed pretty good.

A rail game set in the Incan Empire. Some cards are very powerful and others are situational, thankfully turn order determines who cards effect and the result can be forcing a bad card played on yourself or a good card played on an opponent. This helps mitigate the randomness of the card draw.

Have now played 3 games (all 4 players), and am thoroughly impressed. Well worth the trouble to acquire. Much opportunity for clever play, but the games usually are nail biters due to the intrinsic catch up (aka leaching) strategies. Like the card playing that affects two adjacent players -quite original-. Only downside is I don't think this game would be nearly as good with any number other than precisely 4 players.

No sir, I don't like it.  I think it's got some interesting ideas, and is a decent entry in the "crayon rails" meta-category.  But game as a whole just doesn't do much for me.  The cards can be savagely powerful (good and bad).  The map is pretty unbalanced.  And the early game/mid-late game transition is more than just a bit rocky.  I'd like to see what happens if someone takes this game and develops it a bit more...

A fun game of co-operation & competition and an unusual twist on crayon games. Its got quite a few good mechanisms like playing cards which affect two players and paying for combined VP/income tokens (aka conquoring regions) The cards themselves neatly encapsulate a high level of variant play (wilderness roads & pilgrimages stand out) although careful play is needed to even out the cards' variable strengths. There's also a few balancing mechanisms (changing turn order & leaders give trailers labour) which helps keep games competitive. The glass beads instead of chits is a great tactile addition. This board really needs to go under a piece of perspex/glass during play so it will sit flat and the regional borders could have been clearer.

Tahuantinsuyu is a somewhat obscure game released in 2004 by Hangman games. Less than 500 people own it and there are a little less than 350 ratings. This is a damn shame, because Tahuantinsuyu is a very interesting game, with plenty of opportunities for parasitic or symbiotic play, different ways to win, and enough initial game state randomness to provide interesting variance between plays. 

In Tahuantinsuyu, individual players each represent one of the four Apus responsible for extending the influence of the Inca Empire, starting at Cuzco and extending outward in one of four directions. The primary way that this expansion happens is through roads which the player draws onto whatever transparent substance you prefer to use on the board. As they move through these areas individuals are able to use their labor supply to conquer the randomly distributed native peoples (which provides some sort of combination of labor per turn and victory points), build communally accessed cities, garrisons, and temples (which provide both initial lump sums of victory points one shot and then victory points per turn), build personally owned terraces (which provide labor and victory points), and build additional extra roads. 

While these aspects by themselves are pretty straightforward, what adds additional texture to the game, and makes it feel particularly intriguing are how both victory point generation works. Cities, Garrisons, and Temples each provide a lump sum of victory points each turn. While the person who builds them will get these victory points, they do not own the structures. Instead, each one provides these victory points to anyone who builds their road system such that they connect to these locations, thus encouraging parasitic play. Individual players can build roads in such a way that other players are blocked (or at least severely hindered) from getting to any specific location, but usually that requires enough effort that it is not necessarily worthwhile to do so. 

Tahuantinsuyu’s card play also adds nuance to the game, helping to make it greater than its part. During one of the game’s phases, called the Sun phase, individual players each are able to play one of three cards from their hand. What makes this card play interesting is that you are never able to target just one person (including yourself) with these cards. So any beneficial effects you play are going to be shared and negative effects can potentially hit two opponents. However, your ability to effect who you will affect by these cards is limited by your position in turn order. As during any given sun phase no more than one card can be played between two players, this may end up being potentially very painful if you end up with three negative cards and only the ability to play a card next to yourself or a positive card next to an opponent. 

Turn order is determined by relative victory point position. Whoever has the least amount of victory points goes first; whoever has the 3rd most goes 2nd, and so on. Relative victory point totals also matter during the labor generation phases, as those in greater victory point positions are forced to give labor to those who are farther back. This is perhaps the only thing that bothers me about the game. I am not a fan of artificial catch-up mechanisms, but did not bother me that much in my play of this game. We will see if it does so over time like Power Grid and Scepter of Zavandor did. 

So in conclusion, I greatly enjoyed Tahuantinsuyu and am glad I got it. If you like route building games or those which feature symbiotic and parasitic relationships between players I recommend you check it out. Even if it is not to your taste, you should find yourself entertained for your play of it.

Players represent Inca factions and draw paths out of the central starting position "crayon style" to represent their influence and power over the Inca kingdom.  A typical turn is play a Sun card (rule breakers that are played between two players that only affect them), then draw two road segments and/or construct something.  Provinces have to be conquered with "labour" (= money), which earn more labour, which buys structures.  Points are awarded for conquered provinces, building and maintaining connections to structures.  Nice ideas, plays fairly quickly, slight niggle in that it's hard to pull in an early leader ... more a case of relying on them to slip up.

Novel theme for a good building / interconnections game.  Lots of options , somewhat slow playing.  The card play mechanism is innovative, introduces a bit of randomness, and creates some tactical decisions.  Impression is that the random pilgrimmage cards seem very powerful for such an analytical (and long) game.  Player interactivity may be a bit limited: two players tend to compete with each other on separate sides of the board, since the map is long and narrow; although this allows two players to cooperate to outscore the other two players.  Some concern about the ability for trailing players to catch up, since scoring seems incremental—unless you can get and use a pilgrimmage card, but that is somewhat random.

Early in this I was becoming convinced that a) the labor economy was completely broken and b) the game was never going to end.  By the end, things had really started moving and, to my surprise, labor had actually gotten tight and actions were getting harder to accomplish.  You have to stick with it the first time, ride out the undercooked rules and not stare at the time track and imagine playing until 2am.

Our game ended dramatically, with the player who had led all game being overtaken and beaten by one point on the final scoring round.  The two top finishers had used completely different strategies - one going for building as much as possible and going one direction and the other using a balanced locational approach and focusing on conquering.

I do feel quite concerned about the replayability of the game, because the building sites are fixed in location and number and it seems like there is an obvious best way to move from each side of Cuzco.  I started in the South, and I'm not sure when you wouldn't work to the smaller number of city sites and try to break away from any hangers-on to the high value pilgrimage sites.

I don't find this game lucky or chaotic at all, just the opposite.  The cards are not terribly powerful - once you know what rural unrest can do, it is incumbent on you to refine your expansion and make it a mere annoyance.  I wouldn't mind seeing an expansion card deck to increase the variety of the game play since I feel it is already a game to be decided by slight variations in move optimization.

One interesting aspect of this game is that it presents two different types of collaboration (and collaboration is essential if you want to win.)

You collaborate during the Sun phase with the players sitting next to you at the table, and you collaborate during the Sapa Inca phase with the players whose networks are near yours on the map.

A simple but compelling game. After a single turn you get the idea and if flows perfectly from there. The action cards are well-tuned and do not unbalance the game (as it unfortunately tends to be the case with these low profile titles). The rating is for gameplay alone, since the board and the bits are very bad, even considering the low budget release.

Wow! Quite a sleeper hit. Very impressive. I really enjoyed playing this road building game. 1 play with 4 players and it was a blast. Very tactical and not too heavy. The mechanics are smooth and well done. It could have been shorter however. Also the bits are not on par with the caliber of this game but they work very well. There is gang up on the leader going on constantly too, but that kept the game quite dynamic. Considering how good this game is I forsee a the popularity growing for it to have a nice re-release some day (if your lucky). But I snagged a copy before it would go out of print.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Whoever came up with the name surely had no marketing division at his disposal. That, however, in no way detracts from the game, of course, in which players strive to expand the Incan empire. Points are scored for conquering new regions and constructing cities, temples, and garrisons, but also for simply connecting to those landmarks. And while the latter means permanent VP income, the former only scores once, so trying to benefit from constructions by other players is really common if not necessary to win the game. Compared to train games like Age of Steam, for example, that means that sealing off a larger portion of the board is not necessarily an advantage since you would have to do all the development yourself. That pretty much ensures there will be lots off bumping into others.

The event mechanism is pretty neat, too. Each turn, one event will be played per player, and those events always affect two players sitting next to each other. If you play a positive card for yourself one of your neighbours will be able to exploit it, too. With a negative card you may have a chance to impact two opponents at once. Now, some of the events are rather stronger than others but to some extent that doesn't matter quite as much as they always affect two people.

Due to all of this there are very few actions that provide an advantage to one player only, and if you need to "give points away" you will normally give them to a player who is behind. Of course, that means he won't be behind quite as much afterwards, and scores run pretty close throughout the game with small positional advantages adding up over time.

The game end is unknown insofar as the Spaniards signalling it can arrive at one of four points in time. This possibly adds a bit of gambling to the final few rounds as you never know whether the current turn is the last. Even though this aspect seems slightly out of place in an otherwise very strategic game it does add another interesting facet and also fits very well thematically. Great game!

I’ve only played Tahuaninsuyu once, and my opinions on the game are not well formed. It should suffice to say that I enjoyed the game, and am eagerly awaiting a repeat appearance. I was a little skeptical about one of the cards, though. It’s titled “Rural Unrest” and it destroys all roads that are fully or partially within unconquered territories. In our game, that card totally devastated the position of one of the players. In Tahuantinsuyu, cards are played in such a way that they only affect two of the four players. We wondered whether the Rural Unrest card should be adjusted so that it affects all players, or nerfed in some other way. I’ll see how it goes the second time through before considering any changes.

An interesting "empire builder" style pseudo-train game.  Build a network of roads and pay to score VP through different structures.  The game has a cool card system where you play cards on different pairs of players.  The road system and VP building stuff is all fine.  The theme is unique and kinda neat.  The problems are many.  First it is about twice as long as it should be.  Second, the game completely encourages doing nothing on your own and leeching off of other players for everything.  Third, huge staredowns and games of chicken occur because it is almost always better to leech off of the accomplishments of others than it is to build yourself.  Finally, even the good stuff in the game feels very repetitive.  You do the same shit over and over for 3 hours until finally it ends.  

Not a game I can really recommend, although there are a few neat ideas contained inside.

Only played once so far, and found it to be interesting, but highly tactical.  The card draw is critical -- if you don't have good cards (either good cards to play for yourself and your neighbours or bad cards to play *not* on yourself), then you will lose.

Interesting mechanic that you have to balance money and actions -- you might have too little money, or not have enough things to spend your money on.  Since you can only keep a little money between turns, it can go to waste if you're not careful.  Efficiency is important in this game.

Despite the complicated name (which rhymes with "I want to sue you" according to the designer), this game is amazingly simple.  The rules are clear and well written, and the game is utterly lovely.  Very strategic, somewhat tactical, and quite unpredictable with just a touch of take that.  Uh huh.  I like it.  Especially when I get wilderness roads and everyone else gets civil unrest!

This is really interesting.  It's a network building crayon game that presents you with Dots & Boxes-esque decision making, since the valuable buildings you create can be used by anyone but it requires several steps to build them.  I like how you can build up your economy, but it can only help you so much because you only have a few actions in which to spend your labor.  Our game had a bit of a runaway leader problem. (1 play)

Tahuantinsuyu has great ideas like the events being played between two players to affect only those and a unique and well conveyed setting. It is a good game but somehow I expected even more from it. Actually, I thought it could be in a league with Splotter games like Indonesia and Roads & Boats or Martin Wallace's train games which it is not. The proponents of Tahuantinsuyu are the same at least and led me to this believe. It might be the inexperience but the strategy of piggybacking on others' builds looks the most promising and that detracts a bit from the otherwise very positive first impression. Another weakness is the potential for uneven event card distributions. Players should be warned before the first play about the Rural unrest event which can be really devastating if you're not prepared for it. Also access to the wilderness road event in the late midgame is decisive.

RATING: 8
An excellent crayon-drawing exploration game. Players attempt to build roads to explore the regions and build cities and garissons to further the empire. Gameplay is pretty quick, and quick easy to learn.

The Sun cards felt a little too unbalancing to me, I would've preferred that their effects were a little more muted. Also, there's a slight problem in this game where new players might be caught offguard by certain cards like Rural Unrest that require regions to be secured. In that sense, it forces players who know the game to play a certain way.

Components are mixed: board was nice, but some roads were really crooked and hard to draw on, and of course, you should not use the crayons given in the game. The glass bits are fantastic, as were the cards.

A pretty good network building game but some of the cards seem unbalanced. As well, in the games we have played the off road ability has eliminated any advantage of blocking and resulted in everyone accessing almost the same number of cities/temples.

RATING: 6
There's a generally nice game here, but the strong influence of chance can sometimes lead to major imbalances.  I agree with more experienced players who say that there are some map imbalances as well, due to the historical nature of the map.  There's definitely an issue with the explicit imbalances of the Sun cards (i.e., there are cards that are strictly better than others, as well as major situational advantages) and randomly distributed region markers.  Player-blocking (accidental or intentional) can also swing the game significantly.  The game is also very long and fiddly with the given components.  There are decently strong leader-slowing mechanisms to help balance good luck, but they may contribute to the random feel, and they focus only on current victory points, which aren't always a good measure of player success.

The game is genuinely interesting and enjoyable, but the randomness and heavy-handed balancing are a bit much for such a long game.  A player can feel randomly beaten down and then artificially lifted up in the same game.  This may help equalize scores, but it can also give a player the feeling that his decisions have limited impact on the game, a major drawback for games that require a large time investment.

RATING: 8
Fantastic network building game with interesting historical flavor and player interaction.  Event cards provide much of the interest here and the fact that each event affects two of the four players makes for some delightfully difficult decisions for players with turn-order advantage.  Do I benefit myself and one of my opponents or do I harm two of my opponents?

I've heard it described as "Inca Rails", b/c of it's similarities with crayon rails, and also draws favorable comparisons with Funkenschlag's 1st edition.  It has a major element of a connections/network planning and building actions game, with a very innovative card playing mechanic.  At first blush, there is much more here than meets the eye:  a very good game with depth as the game develops.  There are lots of tense choices and interaction is very high between players as the game develops.  There always seems to never be enough turns to do the many splendid actions you plan for.  Labor is currency in the game and that is very important as well as the tactics of board position.  Here are some of my minor quibbles of this wonderful game:  The random mixed distribution of Conquest Chips could give you a poor or even bad start position (the first ring of chips) immediately at the front of the Cuzco home base.  [IMO, perhaps it may be better to distribute a fairer start position for all if you're placed a 2/1/2 chip or a 1/1/1 chip directly in front of their start position...?]  The 3/0/3 chips are definitely very good to have and perhaps even "too lucky" for someone who grabs 2 or more in the early half of the game.  A potential runaway leader issue I noticed is that the lead player goes last and could connect to whatever the previous players have built if they're not careful to build away from the leader(s).  [Perhaps a variant which allows the lagging player to "choose" whatever turn order card that player wants would make it even more balanced.  This shouldn't be a problem for experienced players.]  The board map is not near the quality of a Mayfair crayon rail game.  Thus, to avoid any permanant damage, I generally play this using a transparency overlay sheet (5 mil acetate) over the original map and use dry erase markers as suggested by the designer.  I highly recommend this game even though the production quality isn't high...

One of my "orphan" games finally brought to table (10/3/08). We played with three and generally had an enjoyable time. For a first play it went long - rules, questions about the map etc.

We would all play again and certainly would like to try it with four.

The biggest issue I had with the game (I was last by 15 pts - due to a late game Epidemic card) was the map. While attractive, the area boundaries caused questions to arise as to locations of say Garrisons. The map is also quite long and difficult to read if you are playing off the long end. A separate score track with an enlarged map with more distinctive coloration could ease some of those concerns.

I don't like crayons - so in crayon games (think Mayfair Empire Builder family) we use dry erase markers. I would have done this with the Tahu map except that it did not unfold well so we "plexiglassed" it.

In all a very good game with a short rule set that can be on the vicious side due to the event cards.

Tahuantinsuyu is a designer-published "train" game that has been picked up for republication in the near future by Z-Man games. In it, players represent factions of the nascent Incan Empire out to earn glory by expanding Inca territory and building infrastructure in the new territory.

This is done by using your supply of underlings to build roads, conquer new lands, build new structures like cities, temples and garrisons, and providing your burgeoning fiefdom with direct access to the great works of others. Complicating matters is the will of the gods, represented by sun cards that you and your opponents play in between two players (possibly including yourself). Those cards change the rules for the players they are adjacent until the end of the current era of the empire.

Theme notwithstanding, this is an unconventional rail game, and it could have been rethemed as such without too much effort. Each player builds his network, gaining some VPs – and more importantly a larger workforce – for accessing new territories. You also score for building improvements at key sites – some can hold cities, which can, in turn, hold temples, others garrisons. While you score some nice points for building these improvements, the real juice is in the ongoing VP income they provide in each scoring phase, and once they have been built, all that matters is connections to these structures, so gain income by connecting to structures your opponents have built.

This means that you must balance the desire to score the big points for building new structures against the cheaper income of linking your network to the work of others. You also have to balance developing your labour force (used to build and conquer) early in the game. If you develop it too fast, you waste labour capacity and leave gaping swathes of territory for others to exploit, but if you aren't aggressive enough, you can get blocked out of entire sections of the map, and you may find yourself with a labour shortage in the later stages of the game.

All in all, I enjoyed Tahuantinsuyu a lot, and look forward to playing it again soon. It is a bit opaque in the early stages of your first game, as you might expect, but the rules are actually quite simple, even with a couple of slightly fussy bits.It's a bit chaotic, thanks to the sun cards, but not outrageous, and it offers good, tough decisions for such a straightforward rules package and should have really good replayability. The forthcoming rerelease will offer improved components (although it will complicate set up a bit by using wooden sticks instead of crayons for marking networks – baggies will help, obviously) and a few new variants, and I'd say that anyone that enjoys train games or strategic games needs to check it out.

There are a lot of things to like about this game, and I can understand why others enjoy it. For myself, however, it falls short in a number of areas:

* It takes way too long to play. I can handle 90 minutes for a game, but 3 hours is way too long.
* It really isn't very fun to play. It is satisfying - planning a strategy, dealing with the tactical decisions, seeing your investments pay off, etc. - but it just isn't a fun game - filled with laughter and good sport.
* There are just too many dynamics going on simultaneously for me - conquering territory, building or exploring, special cards, off-roading, scoring rounds, etc. There is just too much going on. 

One thing that I think would have helped a lot is to allow as many moves during the building phase as desired, given the available labor resources. I really wanted to follow a strategy of loading up on resources early on, but couldn't capitalize on them since my spending was limited. In the end, I just had to turn back in many of my labor resources at the end of each round.

Overall, a pretty well developed game, but just not my cup of tea.

I have only played this one time but it will get a second play as soon as possible. 

This was a Fun easy game of road building. Some of the rules were a bit unclear and certain cards seemed a bit strong but that probably had to do with the 1st time play.

Very good game with original elements of cards that work for the player left and right. After the good advice of Kisa, I used plexiglass and whiteboard markers instead of the crayon. That way it is very easy and clear to draw the roads. Easy to delete roads as well in case of rural unrest ;-).

RATING: 7.5
Yet another empire-building game with little direct conflict between the players.  Clever card play mechanics and a turn sequence that escalates until the Spanish arrive are the high points.  The theme is pretty thin, though, and its play time of about 3 hours is just a little too long.  With more historical chrome and a play time of about 2 hours, this could have been an 8 or even a 9.

Still, you gotta respect the anti-marketing decision to give it a completely unpronounceable Inca name.  I'll give it another half point for that.

Acquired by a transaction with a Geek member at Essen, ´06.  Wanted this one for quite a while.  Played a 4-player game in 2.5 hours, and really enjoyed it.  I made some mistakes, but felt I could manage them.  Very different play styles by the four players, and all worked pretty well as the final score was relatively close.  Crayons a bit difficult to see on the board, but I loved the glass markers and the card play.  Worked better with a plastic coversheet and erasable pends.  Nice mechanism for helping out the trailers without being too overt.  Will be a keeper for my collection.

A very cool game that is divided into distinct phases.  In the Inca round players get money (building resources) and the last place player gets extra income from the first place player.  In the Sun phase turn-order is changed then in turn-order, using a unique mechanism, cards are laid down between two of the players.  The cards played are culmulative until the round ends.  So on the second phase you'll need to deal with the culmulative results of four cards (since you're between 2 players x two phases).  Cards will help or hurt you.  In the People phase players build roads and construct something (for victory points).  There are some tough trade-offs between getting points, which can move you to first place and cost you income OR gaining more income (by conquering territories).  The road-building is much like a crayon-rail game but instead of setting up deliveries on a route you're just connecting to cities, etc.  Of course, there's plenty of room for blocking other players.  In the Sapa Inca phase players gain victory points (based on the cities, temples, etc. they're connected to.)  Overall, I found that there's a lot to think about and a ton of tough choices.  Have only tried with 3 players but looking foward to a tighter 4-player game.

Not a bad game. They should have named it inca roads instead of tahanyatsusomthinglikethat. It runs a bit long, but you can't tell, flows nicely. Has interesting effects with the sun cards, takes the scream machine idea of shared cards between players. Lots of screw your neighbor effects, which I like. The board is a bit on the cheap side, we made a laminate board. Couple of confusing rules, but besides that pretty good game.

There are great levers, some of them quite novel, for pushing other players' incentives around, something I always enjoy in a game. 

Most construction actions provide a burst of points to the builder, and a moderate drip of points-per-turn to everyone whose road network touches it. Should I build the city, using my Labor tokens, for 4pts + 3pts per turn, or should I rely on my neighbour to build it knowing I'll still get 3 pts per turn, but won't spend the labor?

In one phase of the game, the Sun Phase, each player plays an event card between any two players on the table, until each pair of adjacent players has a card. In a 4p game, that's 2 slots you want 'good' cards in, and 2 slots where you'd like to see 'bad' cards. If you're placing first, do you drop a good card next to you, to ensure you have at least one? Or maybe put a bad card between your opposite and adjacent neighbors, hoping that the adjacent neighbor will feel they need to use their turn to put a good card between them and you?

I will say this, though: if you want the first play to be a competitive play, go through the Sun Card deck once and make sure that everyone knows what's in there. We did not do this, and in particular the appearance of Rural Unrest was devastating. It won't be, on second play; it's just necessary to play knowing that it exists.

Looking forward to more of this. I've tentatively rated it an "8" on the BGG scale, believing it will drift one point in either direction once I really know it.

The need to remain near the other players is interesting. You don't want everyone taking advantage of what you build, but to isolate yourself is to guarantee a loss. The key is being able to build stuff that you can keep people out of for one or two scoring rounds. Plus, you get a boost for building something, so even if others will benefit, you need to always look at the relative benefits.

Good ideas, but I really dislike the heavy event cards (especially cumulative effects at game end) and the mechanisms against the first player (not that subtile)... And the very very very poor edition is not helping me to like it more (I know it's a bit unfair but it counts): icons instead of text (to simplify reading and understanding), more descriptive tokens... Between this and funkenschlag for example, I've made my choice!

RATING: 7.5
"Tahuantinsuyu" is an ambitious design that tries to recreate the feel of competing Incan civilizations. Of medium complexity, playing it is something of an undertaking, but for those interested in the history it depicts, game play may border on intellectual exercise versus intriguing civ game competition. Along the way, and especially toward the latter part of the game, there is quite a bit of bookkeeping, and one has to be careful to note which colors of roads intersect whose constructions (for scoring purposes). 

In this sense I can't term this an elegant design; however, overall, playing the game is rewarding enough that I can look past the challenge of scoring. Also, plan on several hours to complete a game. 

That said, there are many types of decisions to make, which makes the game challenging. It's also fun to trace one's road building by drawing lines with crayon (or dry marker) on the game map (after playing once I went to a local quick-print shop and had them laminate the map with a medium-grade plastic; otherwise the enclosed board will deteriorate fast). 

This is not published by a big game company, so the components aren't top-notch. For example, after on a few plays, I could see that the crease along where the "board" folds would tear in the near future, which is why I had it laminated. Once laminated it's a very attractive 4-color board, and one can use dry-erase markers instead of the crayons that come with the game. Some of the flat, plastic markers have also broken, but for me the design overcomes concerns about component quality. 

It is also obvious that the designer is very knowledgeable about this subject, and he has been able to infuse theme into this game, which is no small feat. I think the only mistake they made was naming it "Tahuantinsuyu," instead of its English translated name, "Land of the 4 Regions." 

The lack of battles (rather, players buy out regions to "conquer" them) takes away some aspect of fun, but that's also more historically accurate. On the whole this is an outstanding design, one which I expect to play periodically and consider a definite keeper. For others, they might want to learn it from someone who owns the game, so they can decide for themselves whether they want to own it.

Purchased and received, January 2008. Copy #234. (Note: re-published in late 2010 by Z-Man Games, with far more professional components. I'm not knowledgeable about what design changes might have taken place with this new edition.)

Finally played for the first time.  Very strong game with simple rules and interesting decisions to be made during play.  My only quibble isn't with the Rural Unrest card as others have written (it's there, deal with it - just make sure you're mostly safe from its effects), it's with the washed-out colours on the board that tend to hide crayon marks from time to time.  Without the constant squinting to see if someone has a road somewhere, this would be a 9 easy.  Look forward to playing again.

Upped rating to 9 after many more plays.  This is a gem of a game and the board, once you get used to it, really doesn't affect gameplay.  Sorely needs to be published by a larger publisher so that it gets the attention it deserves.

The rules are surprisingly easy with little chrome. Players set off on their own paths to establish wealth and victory point claims. The main decision is how much do you hang around the other players and leech off their victory point buildings (usual answer: a lot) and how far do you expand away from the other players to build your own buildings and make it difficult for the others to leech off you (if you can whilst leeching as well). The card play between each pair of players, so it only affects both of them and no else, provides a clever decision point for hitting other players or helping yourself. The cards also provide you with strategic direction, where you can prepare turns ahead to take advantage a card you've been dealt from the start. Other than that it's fairly tactical, taking advantage of what other players build as you can, but I've enjoyed each game and look forward to playing more.

This crayon-based connection game really feels like a train game at its heart.  There's a balance in the game between building stuff for yourself and leeching points off things others have built, but I haven't quite got the feel for where that balance lies yet.  Not a big fan of the random token placement--if the big VP tokens are in front of you instead of the big resource tokens, you're pretty screwed.  I'm not yet sure how to stop a runaway leader, but that may just come with experience.

After one play: enjoyable game. The most novel aspect is the card play - in each of several phases, each player places a card between any two players, which gives each of them a bonus or a penalty. There are some interesting decisions involved - for instance, it's impossible to give a bonus to yourself without also giving it to an opponent. So which opponent to give it to? I'd really like to see this mechanic used in other games.

The rest of the game is fairly fun as well. A bit of resource management, route-building, and accumulation of small advantages.

This is a fairly straight-forward network-building game, where you spend "labor" and actions to connect to locations where buildings can be built. You get points for building things and for connecting to buildings no matter who built them. Conquering unknown territory as you extend your network increases your labor income. (You also "conquer" by paying a labor cost; there are no wars or battles.)

Each player has a hand of "Sun Event" cards which can be played to alter the rules temporarily: raising costs or victory point bonuses, limiting or expanding available actions, and so on. Each event card affects exactly two players, so you want to play bad ones on a pair of opponents, and good ones on yourself and one opponent.

This is all made to feel a bit more exotic by the theme, which is to build the Incan Empire by conquering new territory, extending its system of roads, and building cities, temples, and terraces for farming.

In a full four-player game (which again I haven't tried yet) I expect there would be competition for available routes, and road-building races to the most lucrative unconquered territories and building sites. The event card system offers ways to give yourself a boost or hobble your opponents. Turn order changes at intervals and the lowest-scoring player becomes first in the new turn order, making this one of the games (like Power Grid) in which it might be smart to hang back in the scoring for most of the game, then make a big push to win at the end. But that's a guess, I haven't played it enough to know for sure yet.

Although this game draws ideas from a lot of different games, it feels very original. The Sun cards are the driving force of the game, and the mechanism for playing them is something I haven't seen before.
Even after only two plays we have seen very different strategies that all lead to competitive scores.

Crayon road game that must be played with whiteboard markers and coated in contact or played with a plexiglass sheet lest the crayons destroy it. Designer says: "The plastic overlay I use is 5 mil acetate which can be found in art stores in sheets (usually 20" x 30") or rolls. A sheet should run about [US]$5.00."

Big ups from Bruno F who compares it to Age of Steam and Power Grid. Unhalfbricking has this for A$55.

The card mechanism is clever and I like it, but the cards are rather unbalanced. Why the "Expert Surveyors" terrace card doesn't have an additional cost to build the second terrace (as the "Rapid Expansion" double conquer card does), I'll never understand. That said, there's a nice opportunity to hold back on cards to play them at opportune moments (if you have the control of going first that is). You'll want to be labour heavy and points poor at the beginning, then switch to points production after a few turns.

Rules are quite simple to understand and commence playing the game within minutes.

I have some concerns with the game from the fun perspective. I'm generally not a fan of games (like Lost Valley) where players leech off the accomplishments of others. Despite the card mechanism and building theme, it boils down to who can leech off the building of others better and without being blocked by the road system. This effectively kills most of my enjoyment of the game because I enjoy the building side of it much more than the leeching side. Consequently I do not enjoy trying not to build here or there because others can connect, or trying to block their connections. I could play a mean and aggressive game, but with the theme of the game I would not enjoy it. This brings me to the point that your success in this game depends largely upon what the other players are doing around you and doing to you. Normally that would sound like a good thing, but here you can make or break another player's game if you so choose. Often even if you don't try too hard at it.

Important: Note that you can use a Wilderness card action to build a road to any point surrounding the centre starting point of the board. This makes it much easier to expand both north and south.

Update: Hopefully the new release will speed the game up a bit with more connection clarity and nicer components. I'd be interested to investigate it more with the nicer components.

Poor board design. You draw with crayons on a board with lots of small territories marked off with COLORED boundaries. Very quickly, you cannot distinguish a player's network, including your own. It was so much work that we all just muddled along on autopilot. Then one guy won the game simply because he had a card that gave him gobs of points several turns in a row, making all that happened before pointless.

RATING: 5
Played once.  To me, it feels like a more dynamic crayonrails game (which I'm not a huge fan of).  There or no loads, but there's lots of building beyond the routes (which I like).  There's far more player interaction (which I like).  And there are more special events (which I don't like--too fiddly and random).  Just like a crayonrails game, it's takes too long for what it is.  The way the map is designed, it's hard to see your routes.  Definitely a cool theme.

This game is a lot of fun and very engrossing. There are many things about Tahuantinsuyu that I like, and a few things that I don't. I like the gameplay in general and find it very engaging. Even when it's not my turn, I'm interested in what's going on. So this is a game where downtime doesn't bother me. I also like how success emerges from many small decisions, each of which is affected by what the other players are doing. And I like that it plays very well, albeit differently, with three and four players. Many people mention that this game is similar to the crayon rail games, so I guess I'll have to try them out.

The winning strategy is definitely centered upon making sure you are well-connected! In Tahuantinsuyu, you are one of four generals subjugating the neighboring cultures and developing the Incan Empire. You can build all sorts of things, chief among them: roads. In the scoring phases, you get points for each structure (city, temple, etc.) that you are connected to, so you want to focus on getting your roads connected to all the different structures. But you also get one time point bonuses for building cities, temples, etc., so you muct balance your need for bursts of points with your need to collect a lesser amount of points in the scoring rounds. The cumulative Sun cards are a stroke of genius. Sun cards are cards played down between players which have some effect upon them, You can read more about them elsewhere, but they are an excellent aspect of the game. I especially like the balancing mechanisms which punish the lead player!

Things that could be better: a better player aid would be nice. Also, it can be hard to tell where some of the roads and Huaca points are located on the board. A clearer board design is really needed. Play time also typically runs to 180 minutes (which is ironically what is listed as play time for most of the crayon rail games!), which seems just about 30 minutes longer than it should be for this game. But nits aside, excellent, excellent game. I'll play anytime.

What's not to like.  This has offers a ton of tough decisions.  A nice spin on the whole railroad game without feeling like a railroad game.  The interaction is high in pressing for territory and squeezing in to get a piece of everyone's points (without being an area control game).  Really though, the card system is one of the greatest things about the game. While it is but a small portion of the game, the way that the cards effect two players makes for some tough decisions, do you help yourself out and help your neighbor or screw others and leave yourself open.  The point system is clever as well (somewhat reminiscent of Fugger, Welser & Medici's trade order system), I love the rich aiding the poor and the turn order manipulation.  I'm glad this small company is getting the recognition for putting out such a fine product.

First off, let me say that I enjoyed this game a hell of a lot more than I thought I would. It had an AoS feel but without the diminishing returns. A nice slow engine builder with area control and event cards to balance out the game. I especially liked the event card mechanic of placing between players and how some had good effects and bad effects. The card which wipes out roads in non-conquered provinces...ouch. Would love to play again.

RATING: 7
This is a crayon-rail-empire-logistical-networking game. You explore and expand the incan empire, conquering neighboring cultures. These provide labor, which you use to do more good deeds (conquer other cultures, build roads/cities/garrisons/temples/terraces). You get VP for the initial building, but also each scoring round EVERY player connected by road to a structure gets some VP, so players end up with quite an interconnected network of roads on the board. The most interesting thing, though, is the event card deck: each Sun phase (variable number each turn), you play a card between 2 players - it will affect BOTH of them; and cards accumulate over the course of the turn so multiple rules may be modified. It's interesting, but also sometimes difficult to keep all those sun cards (up to 6 different ones per player!) in your head! The game has a fixed number of turns, each composed of different mixtures of phases. At the end, whoever has the most VP wins.

I don't like the board design - hard to see the crayon lines, and the crayon colors are similar to the region borders - but the game was fun to play. The event cards are cool, although it seems they may add too much chaos to the game. Still, there are things to think about (which cards to play, how to try to manipulate turn order - there are benefits to going last, whether to build yourself or follow someone else along, etc.).

I like this game better than a 7 but the thing is that is takes a bit too much time. I guess that if it took half an hour less it was perfect. It has a good sense of civilization network building on it and it's very well balanced between all the elements of the game. Components although they seem a bit home made they are functional and I like the materials. It should play best with 4 players despite some of the downtime and it should have more second action possibilities. At some point players end up with much more workers than needed and that's something I don't like very much. Still it's a solid game with good ideas and a strong feeling of novelty!

I guess this was my first crayon game and I really loved the experience. It turned out to be a different kind of game with this new mechanic.

Played it again and it doesn't take too long after all. First play was fuzy also because of the crayon system but mainly because of the cards but now I can play a 3 player game under 120 minutes!

I think this game has great potential,  It was a lot of fun and tough decisions abounded.  I worry that a few 303 chips early is a great advantage in three player games.  The cards are NOT too powerful, the cards only effect the players they are placed adjacent to.  JULY 2008  Raised this a notch, having recently replayed this game I really do enjoy playing.

Rating after one play. Really keen to get this back to the table soon. Production values variable, slightly crazy rules, but a terrific scarcity/efficiency/engine building/connection network/blocking/variable rules Euro. With more play, just as enthusiastic.

Some terrific mechanics and it was actually *engaging* to play with the card + counter draw luck. I really liked it.

Very keen mechanic with the cards being played between two players. I also am keen on the idea of building the empire and other people using your built cities etc.  But the problem lies in that these are great ideas for a game yet within the game combine everything together and it's at best just minimally fun. I was very anxious to play this and was very disappointed in the end product. Perhaps it's got to do with this really does have a train game feel without the rails.

This is an under the radar gem. It is a great civilization building game without any war. It has simple rules and some great mechanics.

A very well done and well researched game. Clearly, a lot of passion and care was placed in designing the game. While the game has its flaws, it is quite unique. The sun card placements in adjacent corners are new. Game also has several checks and balances to prevent runaway leader issues. Overall an excellent creation!

There's a lot to like in this Incan crayon-road-building game. Playing the rule-modifying Sun cards between players is a neat and interesting idea, and I really enjoyed the network building and connection game. The turn order dynamics are great and I love to rake in the mita. The need to conquer regions to enable further expansion and safeguard built roads is also good. I also really liked the game arc created by the phases of variable length and income. Good, clever stuff here. On the downside, the bits are sort of charmingly low budget, the chaos of the sun cards turns out to be quite a factor sometimes, especially in the last few phases when a lot come into effect. Since the range of cards is from really negative to somewhat negative to slightly positive to really awesome (wilderness roads), you can easily get very hosed or helped depending on the whims of card draw and the choice of where to play them. On the one hand, it's unfortunate to have such swings decided by this chaos, on the other hand, it's somewhat necessary, because it's hard to come from behind or fall from first otherwise. My other possible complaint is the asymmetry of the map. It's small and narrow, which is nice, so that competition for position is tight and interesting. The downside to that is that you need to connect to nearly all of the built locales to be competitive, and it's very easy for one player, especially the north or south starter to get shut out of a lot of area. It's easy for the east and west players to reach both halves of the map, but a lot harder for the north and south players. All in all, a fun and clever game.

My friend told me this would be right up my alley and surprise, surprise.. it is! Wow, I can't wait for this to be re-released as Inca Empire (especially since the poor production value of Tahuantinsuyu causes some minor clarity issues). 

A route-building game that doesn't feel like any other. Maybe that's because of the unique 'parasitic' dynamic created by the scoring rules wherein players can leech off each others investments (if they manage to connect to them!); or perhaps it is the ingenious card system (described in detail elsewhere) that introduces an interesting hand management dynamic to the game. I probably won't play Tahuantinsuyu again since my friend who has it sold it and very soon Inca Empire is coming out.

This is a brilliant game; hurts one's head less than Age of Steam, but has the general play length and the same tension between expansion, infrastructure, and planning ahead for maximum profit.

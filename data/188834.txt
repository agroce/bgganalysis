Depending on the group, just as much fun can be had calling your friends "liberal", "fascist" or "hitler" as playing the game. Secret Hitler is not as logic.based as Resistance, which in my opinion make sure it easier with new players. Most of my play group prefer this to Resistance.

[I]tl;dr - The more I think about it, the more the Hitler theme bothers me. Also, there's less strategy here, and more shouting.[/I]
[COLOR=#CCCCFF]____________________________[/COLOR]

The theme really doesn't jive with me. Also, I don't see the strategy in this game as clearly as I see something like Mafia de Cuba or Two Rooms and a Boom. I'd rather play either of those than this one, 7/7 days of the week.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 1
A game that parodies and induces hatred and talking down unto others. More luck driven with the enactment of laws by drawing from a random deck. Longer game of yelling than it should be. And it is too topically political with the comparisons of Hitler to the current US President (especially with the special optional promo pack). 
I would play almost anything else than this fueling of the f'n fire that is just not fun. The shit is too real. Give me The Resistance, Coup, Secrets, Spyfall or Werewolf any day.

Good:
1. Nice introduction for groups that are new to social deduction games
2. Plays great with 7+ players (up to 10)
3. Incredible production value on components

Bad:
1. Is meh with less than 7 players
2. A number of edge case scenarios will have you consulting the rulebook each game
3. Being randomly dealt a Liberal role or a Facist role multiple games in a row can make the game less fun

RATING: 8
Fun social deduction game.  I can see this bogging down like Resistance if you play it a lot with similar groups (or with people who math out the final votes), but it was enjoyable and good for many laughs.

Would not need to own at this time, as I'm not generally in the mood to play games like this, but it was fun enough that I would consider a reskin in the future when my kids get a bit older.

Played again, and it was still a fun and funny social experience.  Note to self: do not abbreviate the game to S.Hitler

This is basically a glorified version of One Night of Ultimate Werewolf, a game I despise with the passion of thousand burning suns. I may hate Werewolf even more that those deplorable Exploding Kittens. But I digress...

That's okay though, because Secret Hitler improves on the mechanics, and greatly enhances the enjoyment of the game, in my humble opinion. Werewolf is too simple. Secret Hitler adds more complexity. Instead of one quick, boring round of game play, you get several rounds of complexity, as the liberals and fascists (or Democrats and Republicans in the Secret Trump sticker pack) vie for political dominance over a country that will change the course of history for better or worse. Exciting!!

Plus, who wouldn't want to be Hitler rising to... Wait a second! This reskinning of my House of Borgia review is going south. What I meant to say, because I'm a liberal (Homer whisper: I'm really a fascist), was who wouldn't want to kill Hitler?! I think it's that guy!! (Homer whisper: Sorry, you talk to much.)

Buy (Homer whisper: or steal) this game FOR THE GREATER GOOD!!

1st play: A lesser version of Avalon.  The catch-up mechanisms are pretty heavy handed and you can't control who the president is which takes away some of the strategy and turns it into a more gamey version of Avalon.  I'm willing to play it if there isn't a copy of Avalon and I want the same kind of experience, but side by side I'd always choose this one second.  It has the additional downside of being called Secret Hitler, making it just a touch hard to explain why newcomers should try it.  Played a few times in succession.

This is definitely my favorite party game. Every opportunity I have to take this out, I will, rare as that may be.

We've played this with a few groups: one which didn't catch on to the intent of the game and fell flat for half, and was a success for the other half. The second group seemed to fully embrace it as the intent of the game suddenly clicked. And when it clicked it was a blast! The amount of distrust at the table is fantastic. Everyone pointing the finger at everyone. Having successfully won for the Fascists is a huge thrill. The lost feeling of being a Liberal is daunting.

I think that the primary issue with the game is that casual/non-gamers have a hard time wrapping their head around having to lie to the group if they're the 'bad guys'. I understand that it's a foreign concept, but once it becomes clear as to why, it just really clicks. The manner in which you have to manipulate the liberals is elusive at first, but once they see it played out and understand how it worked, it becomes great fun.

Top notch production values add to the validity; the heft of the pieces and obvious care put into the design really make this feel like a real treat.

I might rate this higher if I could get it to the table more often. Absolutely love this one.

Kickstarted in 2016.

We played /user/user/NyQuil%20Driver 's high quality PnP 5 player. The game is a little wanting at that player count, though there was still some intrigue that developed. I think with a higher player count it would be much more interesting, and I want to play it again with more soon.

Played it with more (7 I think) and the game fell into a degenerate loop, that ended up with hitler (me) seizing power, and with not much anyone could do about it. Avalon players HATED it, everyone else was indifferent.

Rethemed print and play version, Secret Palpatine. I don't take offense at the Nazi-fication of post Great War Germany, but it makes me cringe at the self-congratulatory edginess. Plus the art is far better.

I don't think I like it quite as much as the Resistance. We got to the end of the game and I had no idea who could be Hitler, and I'm not sure how I would figure it out. The 'fog of war' of the agenda deck just leaves you unable to come to any firm conclusions.

A bit different than The Resistance games, though the feel is very similar. More randomness involved, though it may influence your play only in one way - making you play other policy card than you wanted thus looking more like a Fascist.

And it's great in social level. Didn't you ever want to call your best buddy 'you damn fascist!' or laugh about little crocodile fuhrer that has no friends?

A fun spin on the Resistance model of social games. I played with ten people (the max) but I think the game would excel with closer to seven players to ensure there is more tangible information on the table. I love the artwork on this one, and the theme is integrated into the mechanics really well.

It's like the resistance with really cool special powers. You accuse your friends, discover your allies, and have a laugh... and when the fun is over, you realize there are still 6 rounds left to play.  If you house rule the game to automatically block off the first two rounds, the game is a 6 or 7. It loses a point for each unnecessary round.

I've played resistance to death, but when the wood box edition of this game came, I knew I was in for a treat. Unlike Resistance, the game evolves throughout the play, becoming more tense as rounds go on and the chance of electing Hitler becomes a real threat.

People that rate this 1 because of the theme are sad people. This is tastefully done, with a book of stickers to cover the 'Hitler' word and cards and even a booklet showing the real history of Hitler's rise to power.

At the current moment with over 30 successful plays, I love this game, and all my friends love it, we love the game, and the fact that it has a "print and play", one cannot have any reason why not to play this game, the only reason why I'm not giving it a perfect score, its because I feel that someday the game will become boring, and that scares me, also, I had a hard time finding good back covers for my "good looking Print"(so being nit picky here).

RATING: 5
Mechanically speaking, this game is of the same vein as the Resistance/Avalon. But because of the uncertainty created in the voting mechanic, the game actually provides less concrete information to work with. Thus, players are basing their decisions on probabilities and their gut-intuition more than anything else. In contrast, players can totally ignore the human interaction in the Resistance/Avalon and play the game competitively. And that depth is what I find so ingenious about the Resistance/Avalon. 

In the end, I found the game to be enjoyable but one that emphasizes the social element over the deduction element.

Wow this game provides a rush! Much like the One Night game series the enjoyment of this game will greatly depend on your personality and who you are playing with! If you are playing with a healthy mix of boisterous and quiet people then you definitely have the right formula. In my opinion I place this behind the One Night Games by only a hair due to the fact that you have fewer ways to prove who you are or validate who someone else is. This leaves for more unknowns, more debating, and often times complete chaos! Even with that negative aspect (may not be negative for many) this game is a gem when it comes to large group games and is a must for someone who enjoys party games. Recommended Players: 7 or 9.

Enjoying this game is very heavily dependant on the type of people you play with Louder more authoritative players generally ruin the entire game by doing all the arguing for everyone and if you have a few players like this then the game generally devolves into a 3 or 4 player game with spectators. Add onto this the fact that less confrontational people and many new players wont really know what to say or how to say and so will naturally not really play and you have a game which can be one of the most enjoyable ~60 minute games you've played but more often than not will end up being quite crap.

I have played a fan designed Harry Potter version which I prefer thematically.  Basically this is a streamlined and slightly simplified variation on the Resistance.  There are not really much in the way of interesting roles although the abilities that the "baddies" trigger at different points (from the third successful vote on the bad side) do give the game a small amount of spice.  One role draws 3 cards discards one and passes 2 on to another player and that player then picks one to play.  This creates a simple but very different feel to the resistance and it does stop it getting bogged down with too many people to select for missions leading more commonly to missions being voted down.  There is not much variety here but with this sort of game different groupings create the variety so unless you want to play it regularly with the same group I do not see that as too much of a problem.

RATING: 6
After playing for several times I still like the game mechanic and the fact that a small party can win from a majority by being sneaky and having more information. That being said, our games often ended quite randomly. It also really depends on how good you can lie in someone's face, and I'm not sure I like that...

Played mostly with a smaller group of between five and six people. With so few, the game is quite quick to complete. As the tension is slow-burning, time is needed to invest yourself in the game's outcome. To get the most out of it, it seems you need to play it multiple times in one sitting.

Basically The Resistance++.

Another excellent group role-deduction social game; like The Resistance, this one also doesn't feature player elimination... at least, not until the closing rounds of the game where the eliminated player is only going to sit out for five minutes or so.

The theme is a bit of a sticking point for some, and it's hard to believe that there was no alternative that would have worked just as well. I'm pretty sure the problem with 1930's German politics was actually that there weren't *enough* people angrily accusing each other of being an evil fascist who absolutely shouldn't be allowed to take power.

I'm tempted to make a Star Wars "Secret Palpatine" re-theme; it'd probably fit the mechanics much better, although I appreciate the license would have been hard to get hold of!

Avalon is my favourite social deduction game and I had high hopes this would be different or better. This game is inferior to Avalon. But if your group gets into the theme, it's fun.

The definitive hidden role game until a new definitive hidden role game will be published, Secret Hitler is the best in the genre at the moment: it even improved on The Resistance, which I used to regard as the touchstone for loud social games and as such I wouldn’t think it could be outdone so easily.

I really love how Secret Hitler plays, the paranoia about guessing each player’s role it sets up, the multiple victory conditions it features and the little randomness it adds here and there as a way both to spice up the game and make guessings even more difficult.

Probably one of the best deduction game out right now.  Adds some extra layers over games like the resistance just make the game so much fun that I see no reason to ever play the resistance ever again.

Another game in the hidden-role party game crowd. I found it fine, but this really isn't my style of game.

Sorry, hidden identity games are built around lies and deceit, which I'm not good at, which makes the genre as a whole very un-entertaining for me. At least it's not long and doesn't have two gazillion special roles.

This game looks so much better than it actually is. It's a hidden traitors game in the vein of The Resistance and Avalon. Two games that are real fun with bigger groups of players. Secret Hitler somehow didn't work as well with our gaming group. We played it with 8 players (1 Hitler and 2 facists) but in all three games only three or four players actually interacted and there seemed no incentive for Liberals to approve facists laws, something this game tries to achieve, given the whole Hitler theme.

As is often with Kickstarter games, I wanted to like it more than I do because of how pretty it looks and the anticipation. In this case I would say; Go play Avalon instead of this one.

Every time we play this the result is awesome. I can't begin to tell all the great stories people bring up from past games when I pull this out. Great for large groups, even with 10 everyone feels like they have an impact on the outcome. Adding a nerf gun enhances the assassination experience.

Pretty good deduction game, I still would probably play The Resistance over this. I'm not a huge fan of how sometimes you are forced to play a tile that you don't want to. It  pulls away from the deduction part of the game. There is always a chance that they might be doing bad things but are the good guy. It was entertaining though, no other game allows you to repeatedly accuse your friends of being a fascist.

Another variation of old "Mafia" party game. Rules are a little tricky sometimes, but finally game is fun and also needs some deduction and logic. Sadly, later on it may involve player elimination, which enforces some players to wait until game is over.

RATING: 10
Awesome game, you can play it over and over, even that you have other games, for more then 5 players, this game can switch roles always and start a new game with new ideas of how to catch hitler. Best games are in 5,7 or 9. In case you play in 6, you need to add a new rule (i had played it a lot): add a fascist policy directly on the start of the game - this will balance the game as well, because 4 vs 2 it's not that good, even if you kill one guy, still will be 3 vs 2 and probably the fascists will loose!

Es un juego tipo "resitencia". Los jugadores pueden pertenecer a dos bandos: liberales o fascistas... Al inicio del juego, los fascistas se reconocen entre sí.. y ambos saben quien es hitler.
En cada turno hay un presidente y nombra un canciller. El  nombramiento del canciller es sometido a la votación de todos. Después el presidente toma tres cartas de política, descarta una (oculta) y le da dos al canciller.. que escoge una que se ubica en un tablero.

Si se completa el tablero de los liberales, ganan. Si se completa el tablero de los fascistas ganan. Además, en el tablero de los fascistas hay una serie de eventos que se activan según se van tapando con leyes... que permiten entre otras cosas, matar a un jugador.

Si alguien mata a hitler, los liberales ganan inmediatamente. Si no, gana el bando que consiga completar el tablero.

ES un juego para grupos grandes, muy entretenido. Recomendable.

Still waiting for this to arrive after I Kickstarted it. The team has demonstrated some genuinely dodgy behaviour in the last few months; a delayed release (I can live with that, it's the nature of Kickstarter), constant excuses, a large group of people (me included, obvs) not receiving the product, more excuses, and now I have been told I might receive the game this month, but I probably won't, and when I don't, they may send me a copy, but probably won't. I would seriously recommend that no one EVER Kickstarts a Max Temkin project.

I love The Resitance: Avalon a lot, so I love that this is really The Resistsnce: Secret Hitler, because the variations on gameplay are interesting. Ive only played the print and play, which seemed a bit unbalanced, but we might have just been playing with strong liberal players. The theme... well, it is unique and feels like its well integrated with the new mechanisms. Though like this designer's previous work, cards against humanity, this is funny for a few moments and then might just feel strange and offputting. Yes, its not promoting hitler, but I still cant just bring this out with any old group. Mind you I don't have to, the resistance still exists, but that factor still concerns me. I love games that I can share with everyone and this is not one. But fun? With an edge of taboo and dark humour? Certainly.

I'm not a fan at all of social deduction games, so it's no surprise that I didn't enjoy this. Even more so, this game is almost completely metagaming and trying to BS people and detect when you're being BS'd to, which for me is not really enjoyable.

However, if you're into this sort of thing, this game is very well-crafted and beautifully produced, so you'll dig it if you're so inclined.

Wow this surprised me. I didn't expect anything from this game but it's a refined Avalon with a touch of randomness (which legislation tiles you draw) that adds a great deal of drama. It's more direct and accusatory than Resistance and I really enjoyed it.

This is a tremendous game.  I am a big fan of social deduction games, and even though this one is in no way original, it certainly has a feeling of originality and freshness.  The subject matter could be seen as offensive, but has worked with a bunch of different groups, including my wife's family.  The fact that they made the fascists a bunch of alien lizard people pulls it out of our universe, but really it still feels like we are in our universe, but I still am fine with the theme.  I like that we are not stuck on a strategy, even though I have tried to make that a thing, but that is just part of me playing the game and trying to mix it up actually.  Fun game.

Game is a lot of fun. After 4 games, everyone likes it, and nobody was confused about game rules for more than a few minutes.

Game is prone to human error. It stinks to play for 30 minutes and then someone accidentally reveals too much info. 

My only problem is that Hitler has been elected Chancellor in all 4 games, ranging from 6 to 8 players. Having read Max Temkin's blog about the creation of Secret Hitler, I know that these results are abnormal compared to the play test data. I also know that we usually don't vote Nien, which may be our problem. Anyway, I'll update this after a few more plays to see if statistics catch up to us or if there is a distinct trend at my table. 

UPDATE: Had our first Liberal victory with a different group. Liberals now have a 1/6 win/total record. Additional sessions will help determine balance. 

There are always a couple games going on Tabletop Simulator, usually closer to 10 players.  There are some meta strategies there, such as who the president will choose to nominate as chancellor (directly across the table is trending).

In a world of too many social deduction games somehow Secret Hitler manages to feel relevant. Honestly to me, this is just a strictly better version of The Resistance (which I don't care for). 

My main beef with The Resistance is that the lack of randomness leads to scripted play pretty quickly, and even just the tiniest dose of it here does wonders. Dark Moon tries to solve the issue a similar way, but uniquely in DM as the bad guys you don't actually know who your teammates are. While it may not matter much strategically, something in the social landscape is lost. The advantage of Secret Hitler over DM in my mind is largely that it preserves the secret alliances.

Worth noting: not really worth playing unless you've got around 8+. That 5-6 range really does not work - stick to ONUW there.

Bluffing games and me never go well as I always overthink the situation. This one I thought worked well, but man does it need a big crowd in order to work. The president passes each turn and they elect a chancellor before everyone votes on that decision. Assuming a successful vote, the president and chancellor help to enact a policy to determine if the liberal or fascist policy advances. It's simple to understand and good with the right group. The only downside to me was once fascism advances far enough they can start to assassinate people and the player elimination bugs me. I'll play this again as I feel there's enough decision making for everybody throughout the game to provide influence.

As with most team deduction games, there is a lot of suspense. But I don't think it really ends up being a good game. There is just not a ton you can actually do.

Really appreciate that a print-and-play is available, and the retail version provides really excellent components, worth the purchase even if you already have the print and play.  Simple enough for non-gamers to get engaged with.  Does have player elimination which can suck, but usually when the game gets to that point, it will be over soon.

Amióta megjött a Kickstarter csomag, teljesen átvette az Avalon helyét. Kell hozzá legalább öt játékos, de a játék  nyolc-tíz emberrel az igazi. A játék elején mindenki kap egy borítékot a saját szerepével: libsi, fasiszta, vagy épp Hitler lehetünk. Libsik vannak többségben, de nem tudják kik a fasiszták. Fasiszták tudják egymásról, hogy kicsodák, és tudják kicsoda Hitler. Hitler 7 játékostól nem tud semmit senkiről, 5-6 játékosnál tudja ki a másik fasiszta a csapatban. 

Minden körben próbálunk új kormányzatot választani, egyszerű többséggel. A kormányzat egy elnökből és egy kancellárból áll. Az elnöki szerep megy körbe, és az elnök jelöl kancellárt, majd a párosra együtt szavazunk. Ha sikerült megválasztani, jön a törvénykezés. Ha nem, jön a következő elnökjelölt. Ha 3x nem sikerül kormányzatot választani, random a legfelső törvénycikket a "nép" lépteti életbe. 

Van ugyanis egy deck, benne 6 darab kék (libs) és 11 db piros (fasiszta) törvénycikk, ezekből húz random hármat az elnök, egyet eldob anélkül, hogy megmutatná, a megmaradt kettőből egyet eldob a kancellár, és egy életbe lép. 

A játék célja a libsik számára, hogy vagy életbe léptessenek 5 db kék törvénycikket, vagy megöljék Hitlert. A fasiszták célja, hogy életbe léptessenek 6 db fasiszta törvényt, vagy 3 fasiszta törvény után Hitler legyen megválasztva kancellárnak. 

Játékosszámtól függően minden vagy majdnem minden életbe léptetett fasiszta törvénycikk ad egy egyszeri elnöki pluszhatalmat amit az aktuális elnök használhat. Ilyen hatalom lehet egy-egy játékos párttagságijának megnézése, rendkívüli választás kiírása (vagyis az elnök mondja meg ki a következő elnökjelölt), illetve egy-egy játékos kivégzése. Van még egy vétószabály ami akkor jön be, amikor már csak 1 db fasiszta törvénycikk hiányzik a győzelemhez/vereséghez, de tapasztalataim alapján ez már ritkán menti meg a játékot ebben a fázisban.

Összességében ritka jól sikerült játék ez, de bele kell tanulni. Ha kezdőkkel játszik az ember, nem működik a logika, liberálisként titkolóznak, fasisztaként nem jól játszák meg a liberálist, teljesen random játékok jönnek ki. De idővel beletanul mindenki és 2-3 játék után nagyon fun az egész.

This is, hands down, the most beautiful board game in my collection. Every component is beautiful, even the rulebook is artistic. Highly recommended!

RATING: 7
Not as good as Avalon. Assassination is inferior to the Merlin/Assassin mechanic: in Avalon, the Assassin's decision can (usually should) be an informed decision. The Assassin has had the entire game to observe the other players and try to sniff out Merlin-like behavior. In Secret Hitler, the Assassination attempt is a shot in the dark. What is Hitler-like behavior? How can the liberal with the assassinate power do any better than a guess? In most cases Hitler will act as normal as possible, there is thus no Hitler-specific behavior to go off of, so the game basically ends with an 11-25% chance (assuming a liberal gets to assassinate).

Still, it's not a bad game. Especially fun when a fascist has the guts to play a fascist policy after being given a mixed hand from a liberal. Related to this, I like the ability of a liberal to fish for information by intentionally feeding a mixed hand (even when they could feed 3 liberal policies).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.75
A clear twist on The Resistance: Avalon. On the plus side, the rounds move quite a bit faster particularly because only 2 people are being voted on each time. On the negative side, the arrangement of who is sitting where has far too much influence on if things will go well for each side.

This was just OK for me - I'd much rather play Avalon. And I certainly wouldn't have invested in the deluxe set like my friends have.

I am a fan of social deduction games.  We played three rounds with 6 players.  Something tells me that the mechanics will be better with 7 to 10 players.  

There was an unexciting sequence we got into on one game...we didn't trust 3 of the 6.  But 2 of the remaining "trustworthy" 3 were previously the president and the chancellor.  It resulted in a nearly continuous "nein" vote until we advanced a few cards.   With more players perhaps that will go away?  Or some weird fluke?  Or a rule I missed that I need to look into?

My favorite social deduction game. It may not be as tight as The Resistance (which is probably the objectively better game) but the abilities triggered by fascist agendas and the way that the liberals must or can use those abilities sets its apart. It also does a better job involving more of the table during games with higher player counts.

RATING: 7
Secret Hitler is a very well designed social deception game that I unfortunately find a bit dry. 

It builds on the gameplay style of games like Resistance - there's common goals that the good and evil teams want to meet, and how/when those goals are reached is what players can use a basis for deciding who they can trust. Most players aren't going to find this too difficult to pick up after a round or two.

Where I feel like Secret Hitler (and additionally games like Resistance) falls down is that  very often the game becomes a shouting match about who looks the evilest at that given moment. I've played games of it where a player who does nothing but work in favour of the Liberal team gets earmarked as dodgy simply because they seem 'suspicious'. This isn't to say that there's no logic surrounding the core gameplay loop of playing policies - more that it doesn't really actually give you all that much to work with, and players can and will fall back on profiling in a situation like that.

Despite being a bit harsh here, with the right people I do enjoy Secret Hitler. Of note, I introduced my family to social deception through it. My Dad was Hitler 3 times in a row, and had the time of his life!

I hate this game. I don't care for the theme; it doesn't offend me, but it does nothing for me and it doesn't help get people to play it. The gameplay though is just a severely worsened version of Resistance. It's Resistance with a bunch of random chance and b-s thrown in to the game to handicap the Good-guy team. -- This game is literally the "is literally Hitler" meme. NOPE.

Would rather play Resistance: Avalon.
It feels mostly like a resistance variant and i'm not sure the new mechanisms improve the game.
there doesn't seem to be much certain information being introduced into the game, not many chances of catching players lying or bluffing. 
Probably not an improvement on Avalon, and the theme/setting is just exploitation... (would rate it higher if i felt the designers weren't just cashing in on essentially a rip off of Avalon with a dumb theme that gets people's attention... )

I come from a poker background so I'm naturally a social deduction gamer. Mafia/Werewolf was my favorite game to play before I came into the hobby. I discovered The Resistance early on and I felt it was what you would play when you didn't have enough people to play Mafia/Werewolf. I didn't like how fast the game moved where you were left guessing too much at the end. 

With Secret Hitler there's much more building into the climax and I would argue a greater climax than The Resistance ever gives. The tension is much tighter in Secret Hitler and the end explosion so much more satisfying than The Resistance. I think this game gives players way more interaction and opportunities to figure out or deceive.

The Resistance deals with facts and logical deduction whereas Secret Hitler deals with probabilities and MUCH MORE actual "reading" of people in my opinion.

*Important to note, however, we play with secret voting which to me is an absolute MUST.

Managed to play this game with a large group of people and it was a well made game. This was a group that I was meeting for the first time so I was a bit reserved in how much I would try to lie to the group about my role. I think it has potential if you know the group better and enjoy trying to talk your way out of a tight position. Use of the envelopes for holding secret roles are prone to marking and someone paying attention can start to get more information about what everyone is. Replace them with some plastic envelopes from an office supply store or just agree to not game the game.

If people can get over the theme & Hitler name dropping it is a really clever game.
Similar to The Resistance but it involves a great factor of RNG.
People will most likely be on their toes as to whom is who, and the elected presidents have variable powers depending on player sizes & time of the game rounds which spice up the flow.
It plays in a short time and it is linear enough to teach.

Easily my group's favourite at the moment (2017) as it's one of the few that plays up to 10 people (yes my board game group is usually 6-7 at the minimum). The rules are simple and takes about 10 minutes to teach but it takes a couple of games to get people the hang of performing their role the right way. And the best part, you can print your own version from the internet if you can't find it locally (I personally prefer to buy it off the shelf)

A great variation on The Resistance and other Mafia-type games. It particularly plays better than its peers at higher player counts with extra layers and involvement. There are also some great checks & balances with the government powers in that as the Fascists get closer to winning, the Liberals gain greater abilities to root them out.

Ultimately, Secret Hitler is the better game over The Resistance, but the latter is a little cleaner in the rules.

Hidden role game.  Liberals vs Fascists+Hitler. Each round a law is passed, liberals want to pass five liberal laws to win, or find and kill Hitler, fascists either want to pass five fascist laws to win or after three fascist laws have been passed get Hitler elected to Chancellor.  Plays a bit different at certain player counts, sometimes Hitler doesn't know his own team.  Fun but the subject matter is a little disturbing / too real at times.

Played once, was Hitler and I won. This is very much a Resistance variant and whilst fine doesn't really bring a radically different experience to the table. It has an interesting theme but there's not enough on the bones to really give you much history. Seating order is important (like in the Resistance) and the end game can get a bit deterministic as players have to announce whether they are hitler or not after the Nazi's have scored 3 points. If Hitler becomes chancellor he or she wins, but equally it narrows the search. The downside is the guessing game might be up but the players may no longer have the voting power to do anything about it. Doesn't quite have the suspense of the resistance in that respect.

This game addresses several issues that plague the social deduction genre. There is no player elimination (for the most part), there is no need for a facilitator, and there are no special role powers to worry about. Instead, Secret Hitler utilizes a policy deck to muddy the waters. These semi-secret policies enable fascists to paint themselves liberal, while a bad draw can make even a staunch liberal appear like a fascist sympathizer. Also, passing fascist policies can actually aid the liberals, so long as the President is liberal. This helps balance the importance of the Chancellor and President in the later game, and just makes the game that much harder to untangle. I'm not a huge fan of hidden roles, but I will always suggest this over any of the other social deduction games.

Kickstarter.  This is a [b]really[/b] good social deduction game.  Extremely intense and hilarious.  BUT, it took multiple plays for the game to really start to shine in all it's glory.  

I think our initial troubles were just a lack of understanding of how the timing of the game works.  So, here's a word to the wise - if you are part of the fascists group, you must, must, must be patient.  Let the deception come to you, don't force it.  Be careful though, if played well, your personal relationships might suffer (especially when your wife looks you dead in the eyes and LIES HER ASS OFF)!

RATING: 6
This is a cousin of Resistance but with a de-emphasis on deduction, which works for me. Card draws form the equivalent of missions, but when a player plays a bad card, you don't know for certain if they had no choice or not. The President draws the cards but then passes some to the Chancellor. Maybe they're a good guy who had no choice because he only drew bad cards? Maybe he got passed a good card but chose not to play it? That the bad guys don't know who each other is adds to the fun.

This mechanism is similar to what Dark Moon was going for but I don't think it achieved it whereas it works ... better here. I haven't experienced that sublime play where the paranoia is delicious like I do in Battlestar. More often than not we understand that someone may or may not have had a choice, so voting Yay or Nay depends on your read of the person's vibes. Sure, you take into account the cards that have come out to determine probabilities, but I've yet to see the game reach a level of brilliance that I want out of my hidden role games. 

It may just be that this mechanism of "is it random or is it deliberate?" may not work well without some extra layers to help players deduce. For example, in BSG players can only take certain card colors and you can see what card values end up in the check and you take note of which actions players suggest. Too often we vote for an administration because it's simply no better or worse than any other. So I'm saying I like it but want to love it which isn't happening yet.

I will say that I'm no prude and my sense of humor is edgy, but the use of Hitler here feels lazy, not inspired.

Like resistance this is a hidden role game however unlike resistance it is well balance  often staying even till the last card play.  Like resistance the base mechanic heavily favors the opposition (fascist).  Secret Hitler adds powers that unlock as the liberals become increasingly desperate and in late game it can anytime if the liberals miss judge and accidentally put Hitler into power.

Backed the Kickstarter and played a 10-player game at PAX East 2016. Super fun, but it is different playing with random people at a convention whose names you don't know. I spent the rest of con pointing at people I recognized from the game and calling them fascists.

Played a few 6-player games with people I have known for a long time, and it was even better. A stressful, friendship-straining fun, but a lot of fun. The rules were different but well balanced for the number of people playing. Easy favorite for our group, though it's good to have a funny game (Joking Hazard/CAH) on hand for the group to decompress after.

Big thanks to Maya for helping our group run the game at PAX. She was stressed, but did an amazing job!

While certainly similar to "The Resistance", this game stands on its own and requires different strategies and play styles.

The low ratio of liberal:fascist policies alone muddies up the waters and makes it difficult to figure out who is who, but the additions of the presidential powers is also very interesting and can be a key tool for the fascists if used properly.  Watching the president kill a player and permanently shifting the party ratios makes for some excellent drama.

I didn't like it as much as resistance. Maybe because of the player elimination. Also, I can't think of a reason why you'd want to choose a fascist card if both were handed to you as chancellor since the president knows what they gave you. Unless you claim you wanted the perk I guess. All 3 times played fascists won with 7/8 players.

Maybe ultra light, hidden-role and bluffing games aren't for me? Everything inspired by The Resistance I have found to pretty pretty blah, and this one is no different. And you can easily win/lose by choosing the right/wrong people and the right/wrong time. Everything inherently wrong and anti-game about Werewolf is in here, and everything mediocre about Resistance is in here. Some interesting ideas with the tracks and the shifting rolls means I vote this a '5' instead of lower. Excellent component quality as well.  But if this game didn't have an incendiary name, I don't think it would have been well known. I don't care about the name/theme personally, but the fact that they connect it to the very real history of German politics during World War II and the mechanisms don't connect two iotas to the theme make the title and theme bullshit and wholly transparent.  You might have well made a hidden role game and called it "Tits Out!" and connected the game loosely to the porn industry. At least the theme of most of these types of games has some connection to the mechanisms.

Better than The Resistance. The chancellor/president power split works well and forces lies. There is also more open, tangible information, which is very important for social deduction games. I also like the randomness of the deck as it helps newer players lie better. I also don't get the complaint about player elimination because in The Resistance, you can be effectively eliminated by everyone at the table not trusting you and that feels a lot worse than someone shooting you.

RATING: 9
A lot like the Resistance and a little bit like Werewolf. The difference I would say in terms of mechanic, is that the bad guys / fascists don't need to be as ''good'' as in the Resistance/Avalon. Hitler doesn't have to be amazing to win because of the mechanic of electing him as Chancellor after the 3rd fascist law has passed makes it harder for the liberals to win. But I haven't had the chance to play this with more than 7 players yet.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Very funny and entertaining game. It seems to be imbalanced towards the Fascists in my group, but I think it's because of the number of players we have (the ratio of Liberal vs Fascists is too small).

One of my favorite hidden role games. Having silent exchanges is one of my favorite parts, because watching everyone have to explain themselves and watching the breach of trust is a lot of fun, and you can end up in games where fascists turn on one another for strategic advantage.

Components: enough to last lot of games
Complex: easy to learn and play
Weight: light
Players: would say 7 or more
Length: less than 30 mins
Mechanics: talk talk talk
Decisions: who the chancellor will be, vote yes or no. Enough for this game
Opinion: so far, it could be the roles game I like most.
Several players, some liberals, others fascist and Hitler in the middle. If you are liberal you need 6 laws or kill Hitler, if you are fascist you need 3 laws and Hitler becoming Chancellor.
One of those games you have to play with the appropriate group. Simple mechanic but the game is about talk, if you stay quiet you could end the game bored, unless the rest of the group don't stop talking and enjoy that talk.
Best way to describe it... talk bullshit so others don't know who you are, and try to discover who the rest are

I am conflicted on this game. It successfully adds extra layers of intrigue to the formula I had previously seen on The Resistance, including good reasons for the good guys to make seemingly bad decisions. The Fascist board is very well designed and ramps up the tension in the later half of the game. 

The production quality is stellar and the graphic design is very sharp.

I always appreciate it when publishers let the players download a print and play copy to see if they like it.

However...

I really dislike the theme and the name. I don't want to casually drop it in conversation, or invite people to play it. It makes me want to make my own version with a different theme. 

Why did it have to be good?

The hook here was supposed to be that Liberals sometimes have a motivation for openly backing fascist policies because those policies will give them power they need to win the game. If that's not true-- and when I played, it wasn't-- then this is just a slightly fixed version of The Resistance. I'd rather play poker.

I bought this game a few weeks ago. I managed to play 5 games with 5 players during lunch, we had a good time calling each other out.  Was looking forward to try it with more players and I did last week where we played a couple of 10 players game and one 7 players game.  I find that while this game is a ton of fun with the correct group it can also be bad if people are not into it.  In the 7 player game, I was finally Hitler and although we won I had no idea who were my allies.  Although so far I like this game I can't seem to figure out what is going on while we play.

I think this a good game for parties when people are into it.

Akinek nem jött be a Resistance
A játék a 2015. év egyik siker KS kampánya, amely 2016-ban fog megjelenni. Szerencsére a játék BGG adatlapján a fájlok között annak PnP verziója elérhető, így bárki veheti a bátorságot és kinyomtatás után baráti társaságában akár már ma ki is próbálhatja.
Aki ismeri a vérfarkasos és a kémes partijátékokat (Werewolf és Resistance), annak az alapokat nem kell bemutatni.
Itt a téma a címből adódik, 1930-es években Németországában két hatalom verseng, hogy kormányt alapíthasson. A játékban az egymást nem ismerő „jófiúk” és az egymást ismerő, de kisebbségben lévő „rosszarcok”, valamint a háttérben megbúvó Nagy Vezető próbálja láthatatlan szálakkal manipulálni a többieket, félrevezetni logikájukat, bevezetni azokat a törvényeket, amelyek megszilárdítják hatalmukat, kancellárrá kineveztetni magát és ezzel megnyerni az adott partit.
A játékban amennyiben a „rosszfiúk” haladnak játékosszámtól függően plusz funkciók, események hajtódnak végre (például egy játékos hovatartozásának ellenőrzési lehetősége, valakit el lehet a játékból távolítani, …). Ez és a kötelező Elnök-Kancellárválasztás, annak bonyodalmai, valamint a lehetséges jó-rossz törvények közötti választási lehetőségek manipulálása adja meg a játék „zamatát” és egy olyan kiegyensúlyozott játékmenetet, amelyet nem tapasztaltam a nagy „elődök” kapcsán (9 játékból a végeredmény 5:4 lett a „jófiúknak”).
Nagyon tudom ajánlani a játékot azoknak, akiknek nem jött be a Resistance.
Egyetlen hátránya, maga téma. A játék szabályai könnyen elsajátíthatóak, így akár a fiatalabb korosztály is játszhat vele. Viszont ezt a korszakot – mégha játékos formában is – felemlegetni nem mindig szerencsés. Érzékeny pontokat érinthet, a játék során elhangzott mondatok akár polgárpukkasztó jelleget is ölthetnek, valamint nem biztos, hogy valaki szeretné visszahallani, hogy gyermeke az oktatási intézményben elújságolja, hogy amennyire jó Hitler volt. Egyesek a játékban elhangzottakat képesek komolyan venni és ez nem vezet jóra. Továbbra sem ajánlott azoknak, akik még egy játék kedvéért sem szeretnek „hazudni”.
Szerencsére a játék az elődökhöz hasonlóan több témára is ráhúzható. Egyik kedvencem a Harry Potter univerzum, ahol a Halálfalók és a Főnix rendje küzd meg Roxfort birtoklásáért.

When I learned of its very close similarity to The Resistance, I was skeptical--how could it improve on a masterwork? Well, maybe you can--it's at least interestingly different. The small amount of randomness leads to interesting dynamics, and the tempo introduced by the Fascism track is very cool. Definitely worthy, and given what I paid for it (no moneys) I am extremely glad I gave it a try.
[EDIT] The Hitler player has no incentive to do anything other than play as a liberal, which turns the game into even more of a crap shoot. Too random, especially when compared to the genius that is The Resistance.

Could be improved with the addition of a Merlin sort of character--a Liberal who knows Hitler's identity but whose own identity must be kept secret. It adds a little spice to being a liberal!

I do like that in order for Facists to win, they have to make Hitler the Chancellor after the third Facist policy is enacted. It puts a bit more pressure on the Facists to make Hitler look like a good guy.

I'm really voting this down since if you have the benefit of copying another game you should at least make it better.

Hitler is broken. A good Hitler plays exactly like a liberal. That means, in most games, winning comes down to Russian Roulette where Hitler becomes Chancellor or get killed and bother are very unsatisfying.

I enjoyed this more than the other popular social deduction games in the market. To be honest this is all due to the theme set in pre-World War 2 Germany showing the ascend of Fascist Germany and the loss of Liberal Democrats. As the game progressed, the Fascists gained more and more power and paranoia increases as the game develops. Mechanically its almost the same game as Avalon. Bluffing is easier in this game since the decision is sometimes decided by the deck rather than the elected Chancellor and Vice Chancellor. As long as you're convincing about your innocence, you could get away most of the time. The production quality for the limited edition KS copies are simply amazing.

This is definitely pretty similar to the Resistance, and I do think I like that game better, though this one does have more potential for humor in the role-playing aspects (that's a bit odd to say, but it's how I feel). I think it's a bit weaker on deduction than the Resistance since so often you'll get three of a kind draws out of the policy deck, which is where this game loses a bit, but overall it's a pretty good game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I'm not a social deception fan but as far as this genre goes, this is pretty good.  You are all members of the Reich Republic, mostly Liberals but with one or more secret Fascists and a Hitler.  The Fascists know each other.  The Hitler knows the Nazis.  No one knows the Hitler.  Each round the rotating President chooses a Chancellor.  The players vote whether to accept the two.  If so, the President secretly draws three laws, gives two to the Chancellor, and the Chancellor chooses one to sign into law, discarding the other secretly.  If five(?) Liberal laws are passed, they win.  If five fascist laws are passed they win.  Each time a Fascist law is passed, something happens to make things interesting.  At the halfway Fascist mark, to make things interesting, if the Hitler is chosen as Chancellor the Fascists win immediately.  This game leads to lots of amusing arguments about who is Hitler but there is also real strategizing as well, so it's a hybrid of a party game and a strategy game.  So while this type of game is not my thing, I won't turn down playing this one.

RATING: 8
By narrowing the field of possibilities of what actually happened on a given turn, Secret Hitler substantially improves upon the formula popularized in The Resistance. Where The Resistance usually turns into lengthy debates about how overlapping members on different mission teams affected the outcome, Secret Hitler focuses the activity of each round on two people and only a few distinct possibilities. This leads to the debate of each player's allegiance being less technical and more interpersonal. This combined with an over-the-top theme has resulted in every game I've played being a hilariously exhilarating good time.

Played one 8-player game. I, as a Liberal, was never elected for any office at all, and so my entire participation in the game consisted of voting yes or no to various proposals.

A lot of good ideas in the game (and the choice of theme is a brave one), but the fact that players can "play" the entire game without getting to do anything meaningful kills it for me. :-( Mechanically, it feels very "vanilla-Resistance'ish", but it obviously doesn't involve all players to the same degree.

(I even backed the game, which I am regretting more than a little now... Ah well, too bad).

Initial Rating: 6.5 (April 2017)

I have never heard about the game before playing it. I bought it by mistake as a friend wanted it and then didn’t take it when I bought it for him, so the game became mine.

The first impression is that the game is very expensive for what comes in the box. The components and art are great and they look gorgeous on the table, but still it was expensive. For the same amount of money I have bought games with much more content. This is a minor issue for me though, if I like a game I buy it without price considerations (most of the time).

The rules are easy to explain, however, you have to explain the roles of the Chancellor and the President, and everything needs to be crystal clear before beginning, so you can explain the game under 11 minutes. Playtime is very variable and depends on the players themselves. It could go up to 11 turns which is way too much for such a simple game.

The theme is great. I know some people dislike it, but it didn’t bother us.

Gameplay is very fun, more over after the first game. It is very reminiscent of The Resistance: Avalon. There are some fascists hidden within the group trying to pass fascist agendas. If they manage to pass 6 of them or Hitler is elected chancellor after the third fascist agenda, the bad guys win. It has considerable more luck than The Resistance, even if you are a liberal, there are situations in which you can only pass a fascist law, so it is much harder to defend yourself here, even if you are a good guy. I like that, sometimes, the liberals want fascist agendas in play to execute the special power.

Secret Hitler is completely language independent. There are some text with aids and the powers, but they are covered with detail in the game manual. We played with people who doesn’t speak English and they didn’t have any issue.

Bottom line, Secret Hitler is a fun game, but in general, it plays very similar to The Resistance: Avalon and it gives me the same vibe when I play both games. I prefer to play Avalon (the superior game IMO) so I see no reason to keep Secret Hitler in my game collection as they are very similar. It has a lot of uncontrollable luck, so making deduction is much harder than in The Resistance. Playtime can be too long for what the game offers. I already sold it, but I’m up for a game whenever a friend request it. Good party game.

Very similar to Avalon and Resistance with a few differences. First, as fascist policies are passed they unlock abilities. Second, even if the fascists want to sabotage (or the liberals want to pass a liberal policy) the deck may have other plans. Overall, I prefer Resistance/Avalon with smaller numbers. But with a bigger group this might be more fun.

Time will tell if this is better than The Resistance.  I think it might be.  The theme is what it is -- maybe not ideal for many potential gamers -- but if that's not an issue you'll find a solid social deduction game here with great production value.

2016-11-06 - I'm still making up my mind about Secret Hitler. I've played it 7 times, and it's a pretty fun hidden role game. I'm still on the fence about the randomness of the policy card draw, but the bluffing that it allows for is a pretty good thing, I think. I also feel like they named it Secret Hitler just to be provocative, and that's a bit lame. Despite that, I think my rating might go up from here. The meta that my group is building around the game is fun and interesting.

Secret Hitler works fairly well as a group bluffing/deduction game. It doesn't offer anything especially novel or inventive, but it's a fine option for those large group game nights.

It is unfortunate that you can have this much fun being Hitler. Like this better than The Resistance: Avalon or Coup, and I feel like I should be more ashamed of that than I am. Probably one of my favorite big group party games. Break it out at your next party and then be amazed at what a lying, deceitful, and twisted group of people you associate with.

RATING: 7
First and foremost, Secret Hitler is a party game. It plays up to 10 and the closer you get to that number the better. The rules can be taught in 5 minutes and everyone can play like an expert halfway through your first game. Everyone is given a secret party affiliation, liberal or fascist, and one of the fascists is also the Secret Hitler. Each turn the player on the left becomes president and selects a chancellor. Players vote to accept the combo. If accepted, the president selects 3 face-down policies, discards one and passes to the chancellor who also discards one and enacts the remaining policy, which is simply a tile that states "liberal" or "fascist". Later in the game presidents can pick up special abilities if fascist policies are enacted, such as assassinating players and looking at their membership cards. Liberals win if they enact 6 policies or Hitler is assassinated. Fascists win if they enact 5 policies or Hitler is elected chancellor in the late game. Liberals start with a voting advantage, but fascists start out with the knowledge of everyone's affiliation and who Hitler is. Hitler, however, does not know the other fascists. All of the deception is the responsibility of the fascists and all of the deduction is the responsibility of the liberals. Hitler needs to do both.

Those who like the complicated intrigue that Avalon presents will likely find SH to be a rather simplistic and dull artifact in the genre. This is a light deception/bluffing party game that can be played with just about anybody. It is exactly what I had hoped it would be!

Wow, the Print&Play already blew us away, we did na-zi that coming, awesome gameplay! Has mechanics to compensate for the challenges of social deduction games like Werewolves and the like, where assumptions start much more random.

WARNING: This might make you dislike or even distrust your nearest and dearest. Some people might also not appreciate the theme, but it really adds a lot to the mechanic and tension!

A The Resistance style social deduction game. Other than the themeatic aspect, the President-chancellor just seem like an unnecessary added mechanic that forces sport light onto the 2 chosen player. 

The added mechanic also enable more information among player without actual social deduction. (Keeping track of how many cards are still in the policy deck etr...) I also dislike how the game allows potential power-play (Calculate and anticipate turns that allow you to assassinate other player with fascist power) which makes the game more about taking advantage of the mechanic as oppose to making social deduction. 

You essientally play the game just like resistance except you now gamble on the 1-2 players who you think is liberal and stick with them, rather than figuring out who the spies are.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
This incredibly simple game is one of my most played. Like most secret role games, the game play is fast and discussion dependent. I love the asymmetry of this game and I find it engages all types of players.

That said, every time I introduce it to a new group I always get sideways glances and disbelief. Yes, it really is about Hitler's rise to power and no, it doesn't glorify him in any way. But halfway through the first game everyone has always loved it.

Although playable with 5-6 players, this doesn't become a fun game until you have at least 7 players.  It will probably always take one play-through for new players to figure out how to use the system toward their own goal even if they have played The Resistance and Werewolf in the past.

This is a game of social deduction like The Resistance and sorts. One player is playing Hitler while the others are playing either a liberal or facist (Hitler is with the facists. The Liberals don't know who Hitler is. The Liberals have an agenda to advance their liberal agendas and to kill the Hitler. And the Pacifist have an agenda to advance pacefist agenda with an extra agenda to not let Hitler get killed. Hitler usually don't know anyone's agenda. Usually it's a very fast and fun game to play.

[PNP] I like this game more than Resistance: Avalon. Policy deck creates more tension between players and gives the president and chancellor a bond that is not present in Avalon. I also like the special abilities that the president does when fascist laws are passed. The game feels more asymmetric and there seems to be more information because of passed laws, discarded laws and special abilities. In Avalon most of the time it comes to 50/50 situations where one of the players is evil or good and that decides the game but in this one things are different because of the alternate winning conditions.

With only 1 play, my opinion may change, but in my opinion Resistance (w/ Plot Cards) is a far superior game. In our game there seemed to be very little tension, little deduction, and little accusation. 

Resistance with Plot Cards allows for a lot more deduction and accusations and trying -- sometimes poorly to convince others you are not lying (even sometimes when you're not). 

There just didn't seem to be as much interaction -- which maybe some would prefer -- but I always found the social part of Resistance to be the most fun. And at least with the plot cards in Resistance, the good guys have a lot more information to to deduce, which is good because otherwise I think the spies are at a big advantage.

I think I would enjoy this more but need additional playthroughs. The group when I played was somewhat distracted and not 100% focused on the game. It made learning it and playing it somewhat messy.

Not sure if I would come to enjoy that more, or if I would just rather play The Resistance in the end.

Game of Hidden Roles, similar to Resistance/Avalon.  With an alternative win condition, evil can elect their leaders to win.

Erinnert sehr stark an "The Resistance", aber spielt sich doch etwas anders, vielleicht sogar besser.
Zwei Parteien gibt es: Liberale und Faschisten (Hitler mit Anhänger). Die Faschisten kennen sich durch das einschlafen-aufwachen Prinzip.
Ein Zug läuft folgendermaßen: Ein Spieler ist der Reichspräsident und entscheidet wer Reichskannzler dieser Runde werden soll. Dann wird abgestimmt, falls 50% der Spieler zustimmen ist das OK, falls nicht wird ein Marker weitergeschoben, der Hitler und den Faschisten hilft.
Falls es einen Kannzler gibt zieht der Präsident 3 Karten vom Stapel, gibt 2 dem Kanzler, dieser wählt eine und spielt sie aus. Es gibt braune (Faschisten gewinnen wenn 6 braune liegen oder nach der 4 Hitler zum Kanzler wird) und blaue (Liberale gewinnen nach der 5ten gelegten blauen), wobei es weniger blaue als braune im Stapel gibt.
Durch diese Karten erhält man Informationen der Mitspieler: "Ich gebe ihm eine braune und eine blaue... wie entscheidet er sich?".
Natürlich kommen Lug und Trug nicht zu kurz bei dem Spiel und so kam es, dass meine Mitspielerin und Ich noch keine Karte liegen hatten, aber bereits 4 blaue auslagen. Ich musste mich gegenüber einem anderen Spieler verraten, dieser machte den Fehler nicht mich umzubringen, sondern seinen Kumpel und ich konnte im nächsten Zug Hitler zum Kanzler machen...
Mit einem anderen Thema könnte man das mit einer größeren Spielgruppe spielen. Mit meinen Neffen bsp-weise würde ich es aufgrund des Themas nicht spielen wollen... Ein Retheme auf Spionage Thema oder Pokemon wäre denkbar  :lol: ... Mal schauen was ich machen kann  ;)
Das Spiel gefällt mir ansonsten doch recht gut.

Zu fünft ist es eher nicht soooo gut, ich würde es gerne mal in einer größeren Runde spielen.

Ich habe mir ein Retheme von "Secret Hitler" gebaut (Der Dunkle Lord, Star Wars).
Das Thema war für nicht Star Wars Eingefleischte scheinbar auch nicht zu verstehen... Warum gibt es noch keine Rebellen? Wie, die Unterdrückung des Imperiums hat noch nicht statt gefunden? Was das spielt effektiv in der Zeit von Episode 1? Separatisten sind nicht die Guten?!?!??!

As with any good social deduction game Secret Hitler maintains a high level of interest for players, keeps them involved all throughout and just begs for repeated plays. I've enjoyed this one more than I expected I would. Even if and when loyalties become sussed out, the race to finish victoriously is not always guaranteed thanks to the revolving presidency; often the timing works out just right to avoid defeat. This is a rather good addition to the social deduction/bluffing genre.

When everything works, Secret Hitler might be a 10/10. Sometimes being duped is even fun. But it only takes one person being uncooperative, or screwing around for the entire experience to fall apart. There have been too many times where I've felt like i've "down a teammate due" and not been able to navigate everyone else to victory.

After almost 30 games ranging from incredible to infuriating, with almost no middle ground, I'd rather play the more consistent Deception or the quicker One Night Ultimate Werewolf.

This excellently designed social deduction game can run a little long, but it's often the best time 10 people can spend with one another. A party of facists have risen in the Reichstag, and liberals are hard pressed to figure out who in the legislative they can still trust. To make matters even more difficult, someone is secretly Hitler, who will cause the facists to win if the liberals can be convinced to elect him to power.

This is a really well designed social deduction game, which is definitely not my cup of tea. It definitely has elements similar to the Resisrance. However, I like how players can often opt to give each choices in the policies,  so these players can get more information for the price of potentially giving the other side closer to their win objective. I also like that as fascists get policies there are different effects, which give the game more of a sense of progreasion. Unfortunately though if you liked the roles in Avalon they are not present here.

Some people may dislike there is some luck not driven by players in the game. The top deck vote if the chancellor is constantly rejected seemed iffy, but I was fine with the potentially drawing 3 policies of the same type when enacting a policy, as it allows for more avenues development of suspiscion or trust when the policies are not like that.

If you do not like that the game has a player be "Hitler", that is easily changeable as the there isn't any mechanisms in the game that scream Hitler, and since the role cards stay in envelopes anyways it doesn't matter if whatever replacement card you make doesn't match.

I go back and forth so much about whether I love or hate this game. I think I love it in person and hate in PBF. It's great for that 6-9 subset of people where you can't really play Werewolf but want some solid social deduction. I know that people frequently say stuff about how you can't know they're evil because they haven't done anything evil, but that's not what the game is really about.

I also substantially prefer to be evil because I think it's definitely a game where you can manipulate people and situations if you know what you're doing.

Also, I'm probably Hitler.

Of all the hidden role games, this has been our favorite. I think the fact that you can apply a bit of math and logic to the deck of laws is what really makes this shine. It's a bit of information that can be more telling about what previously elected players have done, which moves the game to it's conclusion in a more satisfying way.

Simple but fun social game, more reminiscent of The Resistance than Werewolf/Mafia.  I like how the social aspects are restricted to just the nominating process.  The actual legislative portion is so quick and obvious, but provides much more  interesting information than simply "pass/fail" like you would get in The Resistance.  Was it the President who is a fascist?  Or was it the Chancellor?  Or both?  Or was it just bad luck to draw three fascist policies?  The analysis is simple but still informative.  This is probably a much better game than The Resistance, although some (not me) might be turned off by the theme and/or title.

The more I play it, the more I enjoy it.  Since I did not play Resistance or Avalon before this game I was initially a bit lost and had to get over the learning curve.  Not the rules, which are simple, but the actual way to play this in a way that you are having an impact on the play.  After a few plays, the game starts to blossom.  I am also getting over the distasteful theme (even though I still think I would prefer a theme less rooted in reality and not related to such awful time in history).  Paranoia and mistrust is a constant while playing, and lots of subtle and not so subtle con games where trust is the currency being traded.  A wonderful social party game that plays very well at high player counts.  Just be prepared to be loud around the table if you are like me and with the right gaming group.

Fun game. Albeit it can go on a bit long, and be overwhelmed by the boisterous members of your group. But sometimes that also brings the intrigue... "Why are they so quiet/pushy"?

I am not a fan of the Hitler theme. It just seems to be a tasteless choice to even give that historical figure even the slightest recognition in a positive light. ie people "wanting" to be the secret Hitler etc. idk, it just seems weird. 

The art is blah. Maybe they were going for something to represent the era. I don't know. It just didn't do anything for me. 

So for those that hate the Werewolf games. This might be the one for you. 

I have no burning desire to own it. I'll play it anytime. It is definitely fun enough if you have a big enough crowd.

A large part of the game feels like a Resistance derivative, but it seems too easy here for some players to feel left out of the proceedings, Only two players are involved in the passing of laws and it's often the same two (or two of three). I like the larger teams that are needed in Resistance better.
And I really wish they had chosen a different theme for this game. I don't feel comfortable laughing at such a dark period in our world's history.
Still, the game has its moments but if given the choice, I'd always pick The Resistance over this.

Fantastic social deduction game. This is always a hit for large groups of friends, I've never introduced it to someone who doesn't like it. I love the layer of insecurity the ratio of fascist/liberal cards provide, as it makes it so that you can't trust anyone most of the time.

If you like social deduction, this is a must have. Beats The Resistance/Avalon, Werewold, Bang, Mafia and so on by miles!

This is my current go-to-game for larger groups of people. It plays up to 10 people and in my opinion, I plays well with many people. 

Secret Hitler is a social deduction party game that has an excellent theme. I really like the theme of government and how that works. The art is also exceptionally well!

I do have one issue with the game. This may be picky but I did not like the size (or shape) of the rule book. This game comes in a cool and unique long rectangle box, but the rules are also a really long rectangle [attached on the short side] that creates a really awkward rule book. It's difficult to handle and weird to read across such a long set of text.

Nonetheless, this is one of the best party games out there for larger groups. I highly recommend this game for really fun secret identity games.

Really great variation on the Werewolf-style of gameplay.  The extra layers provide give this more elements of deduction and bluffing/second-guessing than other games of this genre.  On top of the the extra powers keep things from getting repetitive and give the game a natural progression.  Have tried with six and have enjoyed it a lot so far, but look forward to playing it with a larger group to try the additional rules that come along with having more players!

RATING: 1
Far too many random elements to make any legitimate logical guesses on who is on your side, thus making the entire game feel like a crapshoot with little to no investment on your part.  You feel more like a bystander than an active participant in the game especially with the term limits that supposedly "enhances" The Resistance formula. Spoiler: It doesn't and making a game that idolizes Hitler to be "edgy" made by a guy who was accused of sexual assault isn't exactly going to be on my top 1000 list.  Although I can see why Wil Wheaton would like it.

Also, the strategy of being the almighty Hitler?  Play like a Liberal.  Boring.

It seems that people who enjoy this game tend to be awful players in games like The Resistance, so I can see why a game that is "easier" would appeal to them.

Just get the Resistance Avalon or if you can get them cheap, plain Resistance with the expansions.  It would be a far better experience and it won't give the impression that you have the social skills of a child molester.

Our enjoyment of the game was really dependent on the group we played with, which is the case with most social/party games.

This one relies on the group throwing around accusations and trying not to hold a grudge.

One downside is that if you play an immediate second game, the roles are completed randomized again, but inevitably people will be untrusting of certain players because of their roles in the previous game. While this might be true-to-life and interesting in a meta sense, it did hurt the success of playing with the second group a second time in the same night.

Social deduction/hidden role games usually fall under the umbrella of "I love the theory and idea behind this game" but there are usually some trappings that cause them to fail.

Be it oversimplification of the base rules (which cause a feeling of not being sure what to do or how to move forward) or too many roles/abilities/things to keep track of, eliminating players too early, or dragging on too long, most of the games ends up alienating the play group and don't have a lot of staying power.

Secret Hitler solves some of these, but not others. The rules are pretty straightforward and easy to pick up. There are some opportunities for players to screw up and reveal information that they shouldn't, which can be a frustration point at time and it does have player elimination, but it usually happens towards the very end of the game.

Each faction also has multiple paths to victory, which can be used to keep other players guessing and provides a lot more longevity without adding the complexity and clunkiness of having a bunch of extra roles.

The voting mechanic for the President and Chancellor-elect is great, as is the Legislative phase. Adding in the Fascists abilities later creates a great pressure cooker of intrigue and paranoia. 

If possible, try to play with 7+ people, as Hitler not knowing his/her allies adds an incredible amount of depth to the game and is a strong thematic/flavor component.

The components of the game are gorgeous with both the graphic design and overall build quality knocking it out of the park. The game itself toes the line of serious and fun incredibly well without being too irreverent/flippant nor too stodgy/dry. The only minor gripe I have in this department is the name itself leans towards the irreverent/flippant side of things. 

With any game in this genre, your mileage will vary depending on the quality of your player group and the frequency in which you can get enough people assembled who can and will appreciate this type of game, as it's easy to take it too seriously and even easier to get distracted with table talk or whatever else is happening.

This title has replaced The Resistance for me.

Simply the best team social deduction game out there.

Rules are really simple and easy to teach. The components are top notch.

Teaching this to new players, the liberals will win by default if the Facists don't know what they are doing. New players tend to be more hesitant and therefore, Facists don't win too much when you include them.

Once you have a couple of plays under your belt, the win ratios tend to be more even, but getting your group up to that point, will be a chore. 

Despite that claim, it's still a fun game as long as you can get an experienced player on the Facist team. Inducting Hitler as chancellor is the best shot for the Facist team.

"6" after only 2 plays.  It's just 'meh' and is clearly inferior to The Resistance & Avalon.

I really should play this more.  Could be I'm missing something.  However, I don't like the slight card-counting aspect, the luck aspect, and the player elimination.

Overall, this feels like a step backwards for social deduction games.  It feels like a bad version of the Resistance games because it's quite similar in style and play length.

RATING: 8.5
Played about 10 times, enjoyed it all the time. Many would say that this is very similar to The Resistance, however, I feel that the President-Chancellor relationship make the game very personal between several players. Unlike in The Resistance where there is a tendency to blame each other that went on the mission, with no one having perfect information on who sabotaged the mission, in Secret Hitler, there is a good chance that the cards given to the Chancellor are both Liberal and Fascist, and the Chancellor could go off pretending that both were Fascist cards, creating this very weird (and fun!) temporary friendship-betrayal relationship.

What I also like about Secret Hitler is that it is pretty clear to new players what to do. If Liberals receive both Fascist policies, they have to convince the Chancellor that they had no choice, or if they are the Fascist, then they have to pretend that they have no choice. And if they receive both Fascist and Liberal policies, it is easy to figure out that giving a choice to the Chancellor will allow them to fish out some valuable information. These are just some of the many examples!

I have played this, and thus can confirm that it exists. I'm not really a fan of the genre, but it's fairly clear what you're getting into; when someone says "hey, who wants to play [i]Secret Hitler[/i]?" you don't need to ask for more information. I don't even know why you're reading this.

RATING: 5
Much harder to bluf or lie, not many chances for the fascists to interfere without making themselves enormeously suspicious. 
A good liberal team (only 2 people) might be chosen over again ... and again.
So based on a few tries, i consider the game to have some balance issues.
Also, it felt more like Love Letters to me than like other social deduction games because of the limited options as a fascist. I didn't play as a liberal yet so it might feel completely different for them.

One of the better social deduction games I've played, but it still falls short of better games like...Monopoly or Chutes and Ladders.  I think it is literally impossible to win if you draw Liberal, but maybe that was just our group.  At least this social deduction game had some mechanics in it rather than just a guessing game.  I might be dragged kicking and screaming into another game of this.

Fantastic game (for a large group, played with 8 and it's amazing).

I really like Resistance Avalon but this is the best Secret Identity game out there, in this one you can actually make some educated decisions and on top of that it's a great provider of trash-talk between friends, such a shame it's difficult to find and so expensive :(

Splits the difference between Battlestar Galactica and The Resistance in terms of length. More random than The Resistance, but the randomness generates the suspicion. It's been a while since I felt this level of tension from a social deduction game. From being elected Chancellor Hitler unanimously in one game to getting shot by my own President after being elected Chancellor in another, it makes for some epic games.

The first time I heard about this game, I immediately fell in love with it, because FASCISTS! In our modern politically corerct world this topic is kind of tabooed, but if you ask anyone what is the most fun part of this game, the most probable answer will be"being on the bad guys team". 

When someone asks me what game is this, I usually say "It is basically Mafia, but much more deductive and predictable". In Mafia, the team that has the best public speaker will win. In Secret Hitler, your words have physical representation in the form of policies. One turn you (being a Fascist Chancellor) may enact a Fascist policy and blame the President who gave you no choice, but if you then vote against a clearly Liberal government -- that's a red flag.

The best part about Secret Hitler is that you have a lot of possibilities to analyze the decisions people make, and use that information in order to find who is really on your side, and who is just playing nice and clean just to start burning 'inappropriate' literature once chosen as a Chancellor. 

It is also a very good history lesson for everyone, as it shows how easy can someone who is assumingly liberal and 'playing it nice' lead the country and the world into a burning disaster..

I didn't put 10 just because sometimes you might be playing with people who misinterpret the rules and think that it is cool to go against their own team, while it is totally different from what the game is about and ruins the fun for their team.

Secret Hitler grabbed the box for The Resistance and kicked it out my front door.  When I played The Resistance with my friends, it went alright, but people were timid to call one another out.

Made a Print and Play "Legacy" version (by legacy, players sign on their first play, tally's are kept on which side wins, players are marked out if killed).

Maybe one of my favorite games I've played recently due to the interaction and arguing that come from the player interaction. Super simple and feels balanced, and when fascist policies are passed, the actions that happen really help the game move along.

Simpatica variante del gioco Avalon. Secret Hitler ne riprende diversi aspetti come la fase di riconoscimento degli schieramenti, la scelta della squadra, la relativa votazione ecc. Il tutto viene integrato con poteri speciali attribuiti al presidente che fa passare leggi 'fasciste'. Nel gioco c'è un'accettabile possibilità di essere eliminati anticipatamente ma comunque avviene solo nelle fasi finali. Il gioco gira bene e i materiali sono decisamente più curati di Avalon, anche se la scatola è inutilmente grande il doppio. Io però continuo a preferirgli il fratellone!

So our gaming group has thoroughly exhausted Resistance: Avalon. We know the drill; lie, lie, lie. We even know each other's tells and cruelly use it against each other to make games extra meta. So we were in desperate need for a reboot. Thus, Secret Hitler arrived. The mechanics of the game are still the same: deduction, bluffing, and consensus building. It's a game of diplomacy, not "nailing" the bad guys every time. The difference in Secret Hitler is that the understanding and decision-making of the two-person "quests" are faster and simpler, resulting in everyone having a ready opinion. The only downside is the name; not the theme, necessarily but invoking the name alone is a bit insensitive and tone-deaf. Still, a great game that revitalizes the tired formula of social deduction-type games.

It's probably slightly better with more than 6 players, but I just found it to be a distilled Resistance with a much harder time trying to figure out who's who and when to start the accusation train.

I'm not typically a fan of these style games anyways, but I just found this one rather dull. This is also one of those rare games that I'm actually put off by the theme. I don't find the game offensive per se, but I don't know why this game leaves such a bad taste in my mouth.

Good party/bluffing game like Resistance and Werewolf.  I liked how there was more conflict by giving laws to people and attempting to frame or lie.  Hitler not knowing the other facists was a nice twist.

This is the KS edition in a beautiful wooden box. It also incorporates a 'comic' outlining the rise of Hitler and the Nazi Party, and a set of stickers aimed at those wanting a Trump version (you could use the stickers to turn this into Secret Trump or Secret Santa if you prefer)  :-)

The game components are excellent - with, for example, wooden plaques for the President and Chancellor. I may just pimp the game further by incorporating one of the gavels from 'Article 27' or 'Democracy: Majority Rules'.

I like that there's less (not entirely none) confrontational lying, because the way the game introduces chance into every action it adds enough doubt that you can't really be sure anyone really is what they claim they are.
The game isn't quite as easy to teach as some of the lighter social games but it's not very complicated either. The components and theme work well too.

Not being a big fan of social deduction games, I thought this game was going to be a flop for me, but in fact I've found it to be drastically more enjoyable than the others I've played, except perhaps for Cockroach Poker. In this game, the players get split between being liberals and fascists, with there being more liberals the fascists. Then there's a deck of bill tiles where the stack has more fascists tiles than liberal ones. On your turn, you pick another player to be your second in command, which is then voted on by everyone. If approved, you draw three tiles from the bills stack, secretly remove one and then pass the pile to your second, who removes one, and the remaining one passes. All this is meant to give you information about who is on what side. The overall goal is to get however many bills matching your side to pass, but the REALLY interesting part is that when a fascists bill passes, whomever is the active player gets a powerful ability. This means that at times the liberal players can be tempted to pass a fascists policy for the special ability, or often times the bill draw might be three fascist bills, in which case the liberals get suspicious of the active player.  Add to this that one of the fascist secret roles is being Hitler himself, which comes with it's own special win condition.

For a very simple social deduction game, there's so much more here than average, and a lot to enjoy.

Social deduction is not one of a favored genres. The mechanism of one team knowing its members and the other team not doesn't help.

Played this several times now and find it enjoyable but ultimately inferior to the Resistance. I do not like how the Liberals can win the game even if they don't trust several of their members, while the Resistance essentially forces you to identify all the good/bad guys. I'm also not a fan of the three failed votes, flip over the top of the policy deck rules when coupled with the player elimination. At odd players counts, if a Liberal gets eliminated, Hitler and the Fascists can openly vote Nien and force the top of the policy deck to get enacted. 
Also realized after awhile that I don't like hidden traitor games where the game's mechanics force some "good guys" into looking like "bad guys" where the good guy has no ability to affect the result. Here, a liberal may actually draw 3 fascist policy and so appear bad though no fault of their own. When there are so many hidden traitor games that can play without that feature, I simply want to play other things.

Many of the little tweaks and new ideas that Secret Hitler has bolted onto the old Resistance formula ultimately feel like they take away more than they add.

At the heart of any hidden role game is the signal-from-the-noise puzzle formed out of the lies and mistakes of your friends.   
In Secret Hitler, mission elections move too quickly to gain meaningful information based on player voting behavior, and the election results are too dependent on luck of the draw to decipher meaningful information from. 
Add to this incredibly powerful presidential abilities that can (and will) accidentally destroy information, or suddenly end the game anti-climactically.

Hidden identity works best when people have to put on an act, and struggle to pull a coherent narrative from the noise that breeds from paranoia.   
Instead, Secret Hitler uses random chaos in place of cunning misinformation.

Me and my co-workers have been playing this near nightly after work, just a couple games usually, ive never played another game that ive enjoyed as much as this wehn playing with the same group OVER and OVER. The game hasn't got stale in the slightest.

Fascists invading the government!? Heil Hitler! One of the best and worst games depending on the play-group involved. I have had very memorable tense games and I have had very boring ones. It's a nice twist to the usual Avalon / Resistance game-play style.

RATING: 5
Not so good experience. Group wasn't in right mood probably. Theme sounds nice but wasn't fun as we expected. Biggest problem is quite "random" law voting mechanic. It didn't work for logical deduction enough. But would like to give another try.

Probably the best competition for Avalon that has come along in a long time. Definitely breaks the mold from other secret role deduction games. The name Secret Hitler might fool you into thinking this is some immature, faux-edgy game for the CAH crowd, but the actual gameplay is pretty clever.

I love the art and the idea of unlocking more abilities the more legislation that is passed. However, this suffers from the same challenge that lots of social deduction games do - that if everyone at the table knows what they're doing, it becomes really hard for one side (in this case the Nazis) to win. Also, the theme didn't jive with me. Hitler was absolutely the opposite of secret, so the premise of this game feels like something out of a parallel universe rather than history.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Great for experienced Avalon/Resistance/Mafia/whatever players.

When there are two (or worse, three) good guys knowing about each other the game is practically over (won by liberals), making it less than ideal for a party setting with a large number of players fand including beginners.

To my surprise, the injection of randomness into a social deduction game does wonderful and good things, by creating more believable lies and more to talk about to get information flowing.  An excellent game.

I understand concerns about trivializing Hitler, oversimplifying fascism, or portraying the good guy;s path to success as the same as the bad guys (take absolute power and kill your opposition).  However, I am not bothered by them being put into a game with good theme integration and lizards.  Really, the lizards help a lot.

update:  so, some games are great and others are very unsatisfying.  Hitler becoming chancellor is just too easy and often too random.  Sometimes it is clever play and sometimes it is just bad luck, ruining a neat game before the tension gets really going.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.8
As of end 2016, best social deduction game

Clearly well play-tested
Explanation length is a manageable 10 minutes
Everyone is much more involved than in Resistance/Avalon
IMO, much less arbritary than Resistance/Avalon
Great build-up of hype and tension that culminates at the three-quarter mark


However, it is marred by KS and component quality/design problems

On Perfect Information and Random Card Draw:
It is technically true that Resistance Avalon features perfect information while SH features random card draw. 
While this may appear to make SH more random than Resistance/Avalon, in my experience this is never the case.

This is due to fact that the amount and quality of information in Resistance/Avalon is so limited that decision-making actually becomes more random and arbritary.

Similarly, decision-making in SH is much less random, since there is a lot more information to base decisions on, even if there is a random element to that information.

I just don't find these "get a role and lie" games all that fun.  They feel far too group dependent and some games will devolve very quickly into an unfun activity.

Better than The Resistance? No. But it's in second place for social deduction games, and that's saying something. The uncertainty of the Agendas adds a lot to the game--as do the special powers invoked when you're forced to enact a fascist agenda. It does some *really* cool things. And unlike The Resistance, it's better with more players. The only downside? Player elimination.

This is the best hidden loyalties game I've ever played. Most things I perceived as flaws have been patched up or correct themselves with more experienced players. 

However, I think the "super super experienced player" balance is not very good. Most balanced is 10 players, almost all other player c ounts have unique problems.and I think even 10p might run into problems with the proper Liberal meta)

Really liked it at first but since really soured on the game.

1st thing is the theme. Now I'm not offended by the theme but actually kinda annoyed about how little of it there actually is. This could of been made into anything else since the only thing "edgy" about this game is the name of it and the name of ONE card. Could of easily been anything else and been ok with a larger audience. If they wanted a dark humor game then go with it and not be so little it leaves it out for many people.

Its basically the 1st mission in Resistance with random cards over and over. Plus with many outside things really affecting the game itself. Depending on where people are sitting makes a big deal as if the "traitors" are sitting next to each other it makes it much harder for them. If there are an odd amount of players there is a bad situation that may occur. And many little rules that could ruin the game completely (seen many games end early because someone revealed too early). Plus more problems!

Just play any of the other amazing social deduction games instead!

I have been a fan of secret role games ever since I was first introduced to Mafia / Werewolf back in 2004. I have tried most of them, but this has got to be my favourite by far. The theme is excellent and allows for fantastic roleplay. You wouldn't believe, how many people will start to speak in a German accent or faux German at the table. And of course, all the secret nazis raising to salute their leader in the end if they happen to win, is just epic.

I like this better than the other Resistance-style games because you are electing a pair of players rather than a set, and the intrigue is in how the pair of players worked in conjunction with the random draw they may have received. It's cool how you can assassinate Hitler at the very end, and that the various powers awarded can be helpful for the liberals, even though you are effectively enacting a fascist agenda.

The best party game around. It relies heavily on optimal numbers in a group but with a good group of people, this can provide hours worth of entertainment and anecdotal stories to talk about later. Incredibly simple and easy to teach, but there is still a deeper level of strategy and meta to chomp on for the more analytical minds. With strangers and friends, I have fun playing this game.

RATING: 8
This game is very similar to The Resistance (Avalon), and it hits most of the same satisfying notes. It's worse in just about every way, though. While every role in The Resistance involves a mix of deduction and bluffing, Secret Hitler's roles only require one of those two skills. While all of The Resistance's roles are interesting to play, playing Hitler is mindless and boring. The Resistance has lots of alternate roles and expansions to keep things interesting, and Secret Hitler has none. The Resistance is appropriate for nearly any game group, but Secret Hitler's theme makes it unpleasant for many players.

This is a great game for a large group, whether folks are into board games or not (we have played with mixed crowds).  It is really amusing how quickly the game will make friends, who may have known each other for years, distrust one another.  

Mechanically, the game feels well balanced (fascists vs. liberals) when you play with 8+ players.  Rounds will go quickly once everyone is familiar with the process (usually takes ~3 rounds).  

It's worth getting the mobile app to read off the game setup instructions.  Use an external bluetooth speaker or something so everyone can here and follow.

The player elimination part is okay... the game is usually short enough that it doesn't matter much. Hopefully they expand a bit upon it like The Resistance had which pushed it to even more greatness.

A genuinely beautiful game. Very very fun for people at any stage in their board game journey. There's a lot to figure out, but it's pretty easy to pick up; even non-gamers will find it hard to phone it in, and will be shrieking for fascist blood like the best of them.

I think I might really like this game.  It's at least so far as good as Resistance, just not 100% sure it will hold up over multiple plays just yet.  I'm very interested in pursuing more plays of this soon.  However, after I buy it, I might have to retheme a copy to play, because I'm not sure I would like to break this theme out in most circumstances.

Fun, occasionally great fun, but a bit harder to teach and more expensive (outside of PnP) than the Resistance: Avalon, for no real benefit (aside from much more pleasing visuals).

I've played the PnP version about two dozen times with two different groups of people.  I KS'd this, and will be picking up it up at GenCon.

I am not a big fan of social deduction games, or party games for that matter, but I found that there is enough tension that makes the game highly enjoyable.  We found that we were playing one rule wrong the first 4 or 5 times were were playing it, which made the game faster, but once we were doing it right, put more tension in the game.

It seemed that once we played, the groups would want to play 4 or 5 more games.  I enjoy this way more than games like Avalon, and will always want to play it over other type of social deduction games.

The mood of 1930s Germany is effective and ominous.  For added effect I had some visuals on the TV of 1930s Germany and some German folk music in the background.  I think other games are more effective in hidden role genre/social deduction games.  There is no information for the liberals in the game only the fascists know what's up.

RATING: 8
I genuinely enjoy this. This game is a decent icebreaker, but does take some attentiveness to the rule to be sure the game is balanced. The first 5 or so games we played, it was extremely hard to get the facists to win. It turns out that we weren't taking advantage of what I think is the best attribute to the game: arguing! When we got into name-calling and pointing fingers, we were able to really enjoy the game and actually gave the facists a fair shot to win (which they did!). We have greatly enjoyed every game we played and I would really suggest.

I really used to love this game, but pure social deduction games have grown a little stale on me.  I prefer games like Bang the Dice Game or Saboteur that use social deduction, but add some gaming mechanisms to the mix.  It's popular enough that I still end up playing it, but I'd almost always be playing something else.  It's solid theming sets it above Resistance or Avalon.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
An excellent evolution of the social deduction formula, largely in part due to the random draw of policy tiles that informs nearly every decision and bluff. If you don't like this game, I call "bullshitler" on that.

I'm enthralled.  Needs at least 7 to really shine, but probably both my favorite party game and social deduction game at the moment.  Cool components, straightforward rules, and lots of tricky emergent complexity.  Receiving it as a gift from a very unexpected source is an added bonus!

Now this is fun.

Like a lot of people, I've played a ton of The Resistance: Avalon. I still rate it a 10 because it's perfect, but I'm not very inclined to play it these days because I've played it so much.

Now we have Secret Hitler, basically a Resistance variant, and it's awesome.

A lot has been said about the similarities to The Resistance, but to me the striking thing was a similarity to Dark Moon (another hidden role game that I love). In Dark Moon you regularly have to hurt your own team because of the luck of the dice, which helps keep players suspicious even if you have the best intentions. There's a similar element here where you can only help your team so much because of the luck of the policy cards.

The production here is above average. In The Resistance it's common for people to ask "who's going on this missions again?" because the small tokens can get lost among the various cards and such on the table. In Secret Hitler you have nice large wooden placards to show who is on a "mission" so there's never any ambiguity. The boards have nice gold leafing to really stand out.

The game is a lot of fun. I would like to see more actual roles introduced in the future. Right now you're either on the Liberal team or the Fascist team, and the only special role is Hitler.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Solid hidden role game.  I also own Resistance.  I'm not sure if both are necessary, but I also don't know which one I like best yet.  The theme helps SH a lot, but I am still not sure if I like the instant-lose condition for electing Hitler.

It's another very solid hidden traitor game in the mold of The Resistance.

This one is a good bit more confrontational since it invites 2 players staring each other down and lying to each others faces.  Or in a rare circumstance 2 players both lying to everyone else.  This can cause some players to "break" the game if you are playing with people who are incapable of lying with a straight face directly to someone else.

That aside I like the different additions to the win conditions and other actions on the tracks.  I feel like they are more streamlined and in the flow of the game than something like the plot thickens cards from The Resistance.

We are currently using the Print and Play version though investment is likely to be sought in the full game soon

Probably the only social deduction game that I will actively suggest to play.

Probably my favorite social engineering, deduction game.  Fascists vs. liberals - an age old battle.  Nothing like getting the secret hitler card and that feeling of ohhh, I can't be killed or we lose.  It's simple mechanic of policy passing drives discussion throughout the entire game.  This is a component that other games like this lack.  Most other social games, you can idly sit by watching if you prefer, but this forces you into the action when it is your turn and or you are elected.  Great game.

Pros: social deduction game, role-playing with bluffing mechanic, thematic

Cons: player elimination

If you only have one social deduction game in your collection, make it this one! Great theme and slick design that ensures that at least someone is going to put on a German accent the entire time. Look no further if you've been searching for any reason to call your friend a fascist. Like most social deduction games, there is player elimination, but it is limited in this, only happening near the end of the game. Not normally a fan of social deduction/party games, I love this one!

Basically a riff on "The Resistance", this one is a little more satisfying due to the better objectives, a bigger focus on the social side of the deduction model (it's easier to talk your way out of trouble) and the instant win conditions. 

The Resistance is fun, but honestly after a game or two you are just arguing about blind accusations followed immediately by rock solid mathematical deductions, which gets stale quick. Secret Hitler's changes fix most of these issues, if not all of them.

I still don't think it is quite must see TV, but it's certainly better than the game that inspired it.

A dice game of building space empires. Your dice represent your populace, whom you direct to develop new technologies, settle worlds, and ship goods. The player who best manages his workers and builds the most prosperous empire wins! Players take simultaneous actions and build up their empire by using many custom dice.

A dramatic game of political intrigue and betrayal set in 1930s Germany. Each player is randomly and secretly assigned to be a liberal or a fascist, and one player is Secret Hitler. The fascists coordinate to sow distrust and install their cold-blooded leader; the liberals must find and stop the Secret Hitler before it's too late. The fascists will use those powers to create chaos unless liberals can pull the nation back from the brink of war.

A team of people are "bad" with one ultimate baddie who doesn't know who his teammates are, but his team knows him.  The rest of the players are "good" and don't know who the baddies are.

Vote to send 2 people on a mission.  Those two people get to look at 3 cards and draft one of them into play, resulting in either a "good" or "bad" team point.  5 good points wins for good team.  6 bad team points wins for bad team, but the players get special abilities each time the bad team gets a point.

Very fun deduction game. Wouldn't recommend playing with less than 7 because it takes the "secret" out of Secret Hitler. When comparing it to The Resistance SH has less perfect information. SH may be easier for those who don't enjoy lying to their friends though because you can just blame the cards.

Was really interested in Secret Hitler, but in the end a bit disappointed that this game borrows a lot from the resistance, and adds nothing. (Except for the great graphic design.)

Note on the theme: it doesn't bother me, and it does tie the mechanics together, but I've seen the reactions I've seen lead me to believe it would have been better with a different theme. Maybe just "the dictator" instead of "hitler"?

I thought at first I wouldn't like this, but actually it's very good. A take on the Werewolf/Resistance genre where Fascists infiltrate a Liberal government, trying to get fascist laws passed and/or get Hitler elected Chancellor, while Liberals try to get liberal laws passed and/or assassinate Hitler!

It works better than The Resistance at lower play counts, but has more going on. Resistance: Avalon has even more to it, but really doesn't work well at lower player counts.

Kickstarted! / It doesn't get much better that this.  Play this game with as many people as possible and hope you can still trust them at the end of the day.

A social deduction game for 5-10 players. The liberals and fighting against Hitler and the fascists for control of Germany. The fascists want to pass their policies and eventually elect Hitler to power. The liberals are trying to pass their own policies or assassinate Hitler. But nobody knows which the side other players are really on.

Crass and a cry for attention. Sitting around a table accusing people of being Hitler is not cool  or funny

Another successful take on the social deduction genre, and the theme is on point as well.

This game is a disaster for new players, but veterans of social games will enjoy it. It only takes 1 Hitler getting stuck with 2 new players to have a catastrophe. I think the element of having a weighted policy deck makes the game very interesting. It feels like it has a little more depth than Avalon/The Resistance, but the set up is also a slightly more annoying.

Best hidden role game I ever played. Super simple rules!
Every of my friends who played it had a great time and the atmosphere around this game is perfect. Party games should be funny and this one is hilarious!

Brilliant, topical take on Werewolves or Mafia.
Deaths are rare, which means the entire group stays engaged throughout the game. 
Careful: this game sows some very real distrust.

It's hard to rate this. As an 8-player game, it is incredible and would be much higher. However, anything other than 8 is not nearly as much fun. And it's difficult to consistently get exactly 8 people to play...

Base game would be ok, but a retheme i.e. Harry Potter would be amazing!

I'm not a huge fan of social deduction games. Secret Hitler injects a little more spice into the formula, I think.

Great party game. Interesting thing is that if all the good guys get on a team they can still fail a mission unlike resistance.

A perfect social deduction game. Components are amazing quality, a really fun theme and it is nothing short of an amazing time!

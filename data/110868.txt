A very good fast-paced game.

The mechanics of the game and the random ending of it (since it stops when the "Game Over" card appears) will make you doubt to skip a challenge and will make you rush to score all the points you can as fastest as possible.

I need a few more games under my belt to really rate this game, but when I have been able to play it, it's been entertaining. It's basically a trick-taking game of finite duration; I suspect I love it more for the theme (I'm a huge Locke and Key fan) but I'm glad I have a copy.

I don't follow the book so I don't know how true it is to the comic. Relatively simple and light gameplay. It certainly didn't click very well for me due to it's gameplay. I felt unimpressed and wish the game to end quickly (honest). 

All strength (these are the cards, players play from their hands) cards have a value from 1-7, and come in 3 different colours (black, white and blue). Every round, a challenge card will be revealed in the middle and shows a colour (either black, white or blue) with a value. This is the value that all players need to overcome successfully (in collectively way; where all number cards of the same colour played by all players will be totaled up). Now, all players starting with the first player, then follows in clockwise order, will play 1-3 cards from hand facing down. Players can basically play any colour cards but those that have the same colour as the challenge card will be counted. 

Then all cards will be revealed simultaneously and we total up the numbers from the strength cards that match the colour with the challenge card. If total values exceed the challenge card, then the challenge has been successfully overcome. Now we check for who contributed the most values in total. That player will get first place and gets to be first player in the next round.

I was told by the person who taught me that the game is full of deception and a good watch at what cards being played by the person before you is important. Ok, I clearly fail at this part as I don't really see anything! They played faced down cards and the only thing we get a hint of is the number of cards they played. I actually simply play my cards without waiting for my turn because there's basically nothing to see (my friend still advised me to watch careful though).

I've read the reviews here and many said this is a great filler. I understand it being a filler game but this game just isn't great for me. I think the game is alright, and probably I'm expecting to much (which I shouldn't). This is certainly a try-before-buy kind of game.

But, EXCELLENT artwork. I love graphic novel artworks and if you're like me, you'll admire how gorgeous it is.

Excellent three-player hand management game with beautiful art and high production value -- especially the key cards. Unfortunately, the box says it plays up to six, and the game doesn't scale up well at all, with challenges becoming far too easy to beat. Also, the game has next to nothing to do with the series of graphic novels other than having artwork from it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A very fast-paced trick-taking game for 3 to 6 players.  This game can also be played with just 2 players if some alterations are made to the Key Deck (primarily removing the Philosophoscope Key and the Anywhere Key).

I bought this game on a whim and don't regret it one bit.  The learning curve for this game is almost non-existent.  With exception of reading the text on special ability cards, it is a pretty straight forward game.  Games last anywhere from 20mins to 45mins depending on the complexity of player interaction as well as luck of the draws.

Definitely a must-buy/must-play.

Amazing trick taking game. After some rules that were unclear were sorted out this game plays AMAZING. I am glad I bought it and look forward to playing it lots. The only negative I can give it is there is some randomness to the game but it makes a great filler game and I can play it in under 20 minutes if everyone knows the game at the table.

I played this with my family before I read the comic it goes with.  For the record both the game and the comic are good.  The mechanic I like best about this game is the fact that cards are played face down, so you never know if your plan will work out and its an interesting game because sometimes you want to get second place instead of first to get keys or other bonuses.  Just a good game in my opinion with great art.

A fun, lite trick taking game.  While visions of Spades may be dancing in your head at that first sentence, rest assured that there is more to the game than that.  There is some strategy and of course luck of the draw.

One thing I thought was a bit of a waste was the cardboard stand up that comes in the box.  It plays no role in the game and simply looks like the house from the comic.  If you are a fan of the series of graphic novels, you'll enjoy the theme and images on the cards.  The key cards are especially nice.  If you aren't a fan or have never read the series, it's still a fun game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
It's a decent filler but only if you have a small number of players like 3.  The main issue is it's too easy to overcome the difficulties that it simply becomes a game of "who drew the biggest"

The other major problem is if you have bad draws, you are not able to participant in the challenges.  In my first game, I drew nothing but Blue Strength cards, meaning if any other color were to show up as a Challenge, the only action I can do is draw one card.  Exciting.

I like the bidding and push your luck aspect, as well as a "second place" price, but I think the game could've been much tighter in their mechanics in a few key areas.  It's a mediocre filler.

Doesn't really have anything to do with the comic books, except for the artwork. But it's still a fairly fun card game, and theres a cardboard castle with no function included, which can stand beside you when playing.

RATING: 3
Way too random. This is a pretty big problem since their is little one can do if they keep drawing the wrong colors. It also stinks that winning leads to going first which helps you win again. The rich get richer. Not a great game mechanics wise. The art and thenme were cool enough to make me interested in the comic books though.

I really enjoy the graphic novel, but if i'm being totally honest I didn't expect much from the game. I expected even less after reading the rulebook, however, I must say that this game clicked with me on more than a few levels.

The whole thing reminds me of the Crisis cards in Battlestar Galactica, except everyone is a traitor. There's just enough incentive to want to throw in cards and just enough strategy to occasionally stop your neighbors from fulfilling their plans. The key cards are random but add a nice twist to the mechanics. 

Overall- this was a really nice surprise. I own plenty of fillers but this one is a keeper and highly recommended.

I really enjoy the artwork, the mechanics of hidden bidding and sometimes wanting to finish second in a bid instead of the first add a nice layer.

I may give this one more try but was very disappointed.  The game is just a random draw whoever is the luckiest wins.  You have no decisions to make, and the theme is just not portrayed in any interesting way.  With no consistent way to manipulate your hand this game is a pass I'm afraid.

A very light (essentially party game light) card game that almost plays itself which is the biggest let down as most of the options are pretty automatic, but the artwork is decent and the game plays very quickly.

It's nothing that'll set the world on fire, but I'd guess if you're a fan of the comics and/or not a gamer, this is a decent entry.

Nothing more, nothing less.

This is not a bad game despite its 6 rating. I'm a huge fan of Locke and Key and while this game is fun it doesn't capture the richness or story telling that the books do. It's fast, fun and if you play with some serious bluffing it can be a bit of a screw the other player. 

It's a basic game, easy to learn and easy to play. Just doesn't have the depth I was looking for.

RATING: 5
I'm seeing this game described as a trick-taking game, and I'm not entirely sure that best describes the game.  I can see why it's getting those comparisons -- the challenge card is the card "led," and cards of that color are the ones that defeat the challenge -- but since players aren't required to play the color card, or even required to play a card at all, it doesn't have the same sort of tension that I associate with a trick-taking game.  The game has its merits -- the card powers don't just force you to decide whether to play it face-down or face-up, but also determine if you want to use them now or hold on to them for future turns, and that creates a nice flavor for the game -- but I don't see it as a trick-taking game.  I wish there were more to the game to allow you to plan ahead, say by having the next three challenges face-up so that you're not left thinking you have to play all of your blue cards this turn, since you don't know if another blue challenge will come up before the end of the game, or by letting you pick a key instead of having to draw one randomly, but it plays quickly and has some nice decisions to make.  I'm not that keen on how the key cards are played at the end of a round, effectively becoming an interrupt card, and scoring strength cards seems to be a potentially over-powerful move, but it's a light card game, so it's easy to overlook those faults.  Plus, the design seems such that it would be easy to create variants to make it a little more strategic.

A very interesting game for a great comic series. Don't need knowledge of the comic to enjoy it, but I find that players who don't know anything about L&K don't take to it as easily.

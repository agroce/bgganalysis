This is work rather than fun. Trying to judge what Poland is going to look like at the end of each turn is very difficult and a minor change (1 more cube here or there or a die roll going for or against you) can have big consequences as the impact ripples throughout. I would suggest that this impact is too big for the game thereby making it "unplannable". And for all it’s theme (and there is lots of it) it plays very mechanically. Wallace games are amongst my favourites but this is a step too far.

It's a good game, but when I have exactly 3 people we'll usually whip out Through the Ages or Maria.  

Also, not sure if the map isn't weighted too much toward the east, which seems *much* easier to defend than the west.  Time will tell, I suppose.

One of the better Wallace, and thus 9.5 after first play. However, the Habsburg rules are clumpsy even after clarifications obtained from BGG (thanks), thus reluctant to give it a "10" after second play.

The best game of Mr. Wallace.
A monster, a masterpiece.
Just be very careful, at the beginning of each turn, to choose  where you decide to assign your noble blocks.

Quite a complex game with a fair few fiddly rules. It's very thematic, but quite a few parts of it are counter-intuitive when you are trying to think what will get you VPs or positional advantage. So even after two games I find myself playing moves then realising they can't help me, and indeed may just help my opponents. Still, there's a lot there to think about and to enjoy-- I want to play more, I am just hoping I'll get my head around it a bit more.

RATING: 5
Where to begin with this game design?  On the negative side of the ledger, victory points in this game are rather glaringly and directly distributed based upon the roll of the dice.  Depending upon what I roll, I put cubes in the appropriate box.  If you roll ever so slightly better, you might get one more cube than I have in the box, and you get all the victory points.  Whoo hoo!  Let's see who gets the better rolls?  This is fun?  And that mechanic literally occupied half the 3 hours we spent on this game!  Clearly, I am not in the intended audience for this game.  Then again, I am just not a war gamer any more.  For my tastes, the micro and macro results in this game are far too dependent upon the roll of the dice. 

The "nobles veto" mechanic in our game absolutely frustrated a second somewhat interesting way to earn victory points, by getting cube majorities in provinces through the clever use of numbered tiles, and prior cube expenditures.  Apparently, that "nobles veto" caused endless tragedy and frustration in Polish history.  We were able to experience comparable frustration in our game. Hooray?  The purchasing of victory points through constructing Jesuit monestaries felt absurdly tacked on and unsatisfying.  

The "end game" earning of victory points through estates is really all that was left in terms of possible interest in this game for me.  But that mechanic was determined by the seemingly chaotic entry of cube invaders into the game from all sides (modified by the rolling of dice), then crashing into one other, then cancelling each other out, then subtracting the number of cubes left in the province.  And all of this was modified by the military dice rolls as well.

"Solving" this curious cube mechanic/puzzle in order to attempt to win the game, in view of the special rules of cube cancellations, and exceptions to those rules, coupled with the arrows on the board, well, sorry, I am not particularly interested in the effort.  Others may wish to spend the time to solve what seems to me to be an arbitrary and artificial cube dynamic puzzle.  And may the luck be with you on your rolls too.

On the positive side of the ledger, God's Playground does provide gamers with a direct lesson in the tragic history of Poland:  way too many invaders!  Well done on this count.  And I like the board, as well as the components.  But really, unless you want to experience a slice of the tragic history of Poland, which is perhaps worth doing at least once, I cannot see much reason to play this game.

Very interesting, very involved game.  It's my first experience with a really heavy Wallace game, and there was a lot to wrap my head around.  I'd need to play again with a better knowledge of the rules to really get it, but it was good.  The rating has the potential to go up, but probably not down.

I originally approached this game as more of a wargame, but that is not correct.  At its heart, it is an area control / majority game.  I was pleasantly surprised by the game play.  There are lots of meaningful decisions and while you may feel like you are about to handed your keister every turn, the game finds a way to bring you back from the brink of utter destruction... usually.  As a 3-player only design, it is remarkably well balanced.  Far more approachable than anticipated.  One of Wallace's under appreciated titles.

RATING: 7
Nice thematic game, it makes you understand the tough spot Poland was in. Very nice graphically, especially after Last Train to Wensleydale.

Great competitive/cooperative dynamic going on: often you just have to rely on the others to defend a region you have interests in, as you can't be everywhere at once, and sometimes your best play is to do something bad for you because it's unexpected, and you end up hurting your opponents more than yourself.

There's  a bit of luck with the dice (nothing like seeing your huge army melt away because you rolled a series of 1's), but it's manageable. While there's a lot happening, the actual game is relatively simple, and it feels like it should play under 3 hours with experienced players.

Need more plays to judge the balance of the different regions; right now, the east seems a lot safer.

I find that these three player games are the true gems of the Treefrog line. After 2 plays, God's Playground is a solid design requiring cooperation to keep Estate values high and Poland's enemies at bay. If players don't work together Poland can get overrun and that makes for a tough game. Scores will be low as players are straped to ten money value each turn. Fun game. "If it's not Wallace it's Crap!"

Initial Impressions:
----------------------
I enjoy games that beat you up, and this one did not disappoint.  The game offers a bunch of interesting choices, but this is very dice heavy for a Wallace game.  The 3 player only hurts this one, but this is for sure one of the better 3 player games out there, although it can run a bit long even though its only 4 rounds.  One I would really like to explore more, although I am not sure how many chances I will get due to the 3p & I only know one person who owns it.

This game is a real gem that gets very little press.  Lots of tension, and difficult decisions all the way through.  Only drawback is that it requires exactly 3 players.  Wish this one was getting more attention within the hobby.

A funny game. Seats three and only three. This is essentially a euro with a war/history theme pasted on it. Like most euros, it rewards long-term planning (investing early in towns with low invasion numbers—your GM won't tell you that) and punishes short-term planning (defending Poland—your GM will be adamant that this is what needs to be done). 

If you want to win, invest early in towns. From there, cajole others into defending Poland while you sand bag on noble points for the national army; turn your gold coins in for VPs; and weep about how you only have enough resources to defend one pet province. Your usual cheesy euro-strategy.

Another decent Wallace game. Lots of complexity. It's heavy. Makes you feel a bit dirty. You need to co-operate to make Poland strong but you also need to backstab/bail  at the same time to get some VPs. Not quite sure how to describe this one. There are lots of mechanics going on. Needs replay to reassess.

God's Playground feels like three players being continously attacked by the board and the winner is the one who survives the board the best, but in any event - Poland is the ultimate loser.  The gameplay is quite enjoyable, but I feel the 'flavor' mechanics are just too much to make this one hit the table as often as it probably should.  For example, the Cossacks can rebel but only in turn two and I'm guessing this is for historical purposes, but at the same time, you can only buy Cities on turns 3 and 4 - which is clearly for a gameplay purpose.  So the fiddly gimmicks are not consistent and there are many procedural events on how to handle situations that every six months when the game might hit the table, we would have to read the rulebook again.  Though, for the lack of elegance the game is quite intense in the second half of the game and it is worth experiencing.  After playing this and After the Flood in back to back weeks, I would recommond After the Flood as a similiar experience done a little better.

The first time through is definitely a shock as to how brittle Poland's sitauation really is - it's counter-intuitive since we are programmed to expand and conquer! The second game was a blast. Whether or not the game will hold up to repeated play remains to be seen - but it's a unique experience for sure.

Well the first play was entertaining. 

Some quotes from a well judged e-mail by one of the other players. 

"The game is absolutely fiendish." "On the first play through you get things wrong, the game comprehensively screws you and you realise why you should have signed treaties/ attacked the NPC enemies home base/ bid for control of the army. It sounds awful (and I think you might have hated it) but the design was so good and so subtle that we were enthralled as well as horrified by it."

Wow, really enjoyed this in my initial playing. There is a great balance between cooperative play (defending Poland) and personal score. You are trying to set up the other players to get clobbered, but you also want your own positions to be safe. It just seems to work.

I'm looking forward to more plays.  I like this one a lot more than After the Flood (which is a fine game).

RATING: 3
God's Playground is...overwrought.

The concept of the game is that players are trying to defend greater Poland from the numerous groups who have come in and destroyed it over the years. To do this, they build armies (and use the king's army) to attack enemies and to defend against the end of round invasions while trying to simultaneously build up an estate presence in each of the regions depicted on the board. 

The central mechanics that drive this are blind block placement and dice, a lot of dice. On the former point, players have 2 sets of blocks with 0-5 inclusive. At the start of each round they allocate 6 of these face down onto the board (1 for each region, 1 for the king's box) and then put out cubes equal to that number. Those cubes are then used in other phases to allow them to buy armies, attack with their armies, to win a little majority fight to basically gain occasional use of the king's army (or score VPs) and to build more estates. On the latter, dice determine which of the 6 enemies will gain extra reinforcements for the round and also govern combat, of which there is a tonne of. Each region of the board has someone who is both next to it and ready to come in and trash it. Before Poland is attacked, players have an opportunity to try and pre-emptively invade, which can score VPs and also can decrease the size of (or entirely eliminate) the invading force. This is one of the major sources of VPs in the game. When players attack, successful hits leave behind a player cube in that enemy's area, and the player with the most of these in each box at the end of each round gains VPs. The only other ways to generate VPs during the game are one of the too-numerous-to-go-into-here special actions (Jesuits) and having spare pieces left over in the "you can use the king's army" box.

So as I said, the game seems relatively simple, but it's full of niggly things which make it much more difficult to play in practice than it should be. The problem I have with it isn't so much that though, as I have a high tolerance for this sort of thing in games, provided that they offer enough to make up for it, and my opinion is that God's simply doesn't. Too much of what players are doing seems to swing on dice rolls. The enemy reinforcement dice rolls can be significant, and much moreso are the rolls for combat, and the expense roll for the special power diplomacy. Combat with infantry is a huge crapshoot in this game, 5+ to hit means that the player who can get hot with the cheap troops is going to stand a very good chance of generating extra VPs. It's not to say that skill and player choice isn't involved in any of this, to the contrary, the way the player estate discs (the other significant source of VPs in the game) work is quite interesting, as they line up and the ones furthest out (those which were placed last) generate the most VPs if they survive, but they are also the first to be ravaged. This creates an interesting dynamic where players sometimes want a few estates to be trashed up in the line, but don't want things to get too far out of hand. The problem for me, again, is that though that choice or desire of choice is interesting, players are too often constrained by random elements and can't actually implement most of their plans without a healthy dash of luck. I'm not entirely allergic to dice, and count Struggle as one of Wallace's triumphs, but here it just seems that it overwhelms player choices at times. (I should note as an aside that this isn't sour grapes, I won the first game of this I played, but I think my victory rested in no small part on my amazing rolls with the infantry, I was on fire). The blind deployment of cubes also creates a lot of chaos, and I wasn't particularly fond of that mechanic either.

I like the idea of a semi-cooperative game where players are constantly being ravaged and want to manage that as much as possible (and it fits the theme well), but this implementation is not what I'm personally looking for. Much too long and fiddly for what it offers.

Nice to get this to the table with Andy & Tom after 2 years on the shelf. In our first game we tended to co-operate (until the last turn when Tom used the Veto - at least I was the King's pal). The Royal Army saw plenty of action as did our noble armies. We used all of the actions except Jesuit schools so we had explored most of the basic strategies & our biggest failure was against the Hapsburgs. Our scores ranged between 43 and about 25. Interesting dynamics - balancing self-interest and survival. Lovely illustrations on the map.

Subject of the game: great
The game is pretty heavy and has some chrome to make things historically correct, like the Ottomans attack on Austria and the Poles galloping in for defense. Lovely.

The balance between the greater good (Poland) and personal gain didn't quite show during the first play. Poland was screwed badly. Four times the veto-action was chosen and cooperation was minimal. Also, it's hard to discern any potential strategies in this game.

Anyway, so far I like this one a lot more than After the Flood. But not the great game I hope it could be. Maybe a second play will show me wrong.

Edit: the game gets better and better.

RATING: 9
A hot mess of a game. Brain melty (just getting the Ottoman-Hapsburg rules straight is a minor feat), but with highly uncertain visibility into the future due to huge swings of the dice. You do not have complete control of your destiny. Accept this. That said, good play will definitely influence the outcome of the game, it just isn't a guarantee.  This is a guilty pleasure for me, and I am happy/lucky that I have had friends willing to play this several times with me, despite not being nearly as enamoured with it as I am.  Not for everyone, that is for sure!

Quite a bit heavier than the Treefrog offerings to date.  Despite all 3 players working (somewhat) to defend Poland, this IS NOT a cooperative game!!  :)  Endless tough decisions to make and opportunities for personal gain at the expense of others.  As with other Wallace games, it's a superb implementation of the theme, with Senate seats, invading armies, Hapsburg political influence, and special actions.  I expect to enjoy it for many, many plays.

I suspect that this game is not rated higher, simply because of the fiddliness (complexity) with the Ottoman/Hapsburg rules.  If you can plow your way through these, then you'll enjoy the game.

RATING: 9.5
Update - keeps getting better. Only the fiddliness around the Hapsburgs remains an issue. Up to a 9. 

Update - another play with rules straight out of the box - up to an 8. This is good - just the slight fiddliness stops it going higher.

I think part of the original issue is the large number of phases per turn and not many turns - so you never really get into a rhythm of playing during the first couple of games, i.e. you're always asking 'OK what phase is next?"

A tough one to rate this - as it plays out of the box it is probably down at 5-6 however if it realised it's full potential it would be up there as a 8-9 - and that might changeas familiarity smoothes out the play.

The good:-

- The theme is incredibly well realised by the game.
- The concept of a semi-cooperative game in which everyone is scrambling to try and make points themselves while ostensibly (or not) trying to defend Polish territory from numerous threats is very good.
- It almost works. (edit - it does work, and very well)
- It's fun - a lot of fun with the right players.

The bad:-

- Rules are fiddly and there are numerous excpetions on particular turns and with attacks from certain provinces. This helps represent the history but does complicate the game. The way the Hapsburgs are handled is perhaps the most obtuse.
- The rule book is not the best and there are some ambiguities and situations not covered.
- Could do with a visual turn summary player aid - not just a written one.
- Feels like the rule book was one iteration and a final polish short, when it went to press.

I'm an avid follower of Wallace's games, and this one really really hits a sweet spot for me. Modest play time, conflict, cooperation with competition. My favorite Wallace title, and that is saying quite a bit! 

Players vie for prestige by expending their nobles to preemptively strike at neighbors, build up principalities, or sacrifice them for pure VP's ('Jesuit missionaries'). Each region offers different rewards and faces a different flavor of invader. If you fail to strike out enough at the neighboring nation, then they will invade and you must save the day, possibly calling up a national army or face invasion into neighboring regions! If you don't co-operate to some extent, Poland will fall!

One of the few good three player games. Feel is somewhat similar to Republic of Rome, but this one is slightly less random and shorter. The rulebook is as expected the weak point of the game. Rules are hidden in plain text and small things are easily missed which makes playing somewhat difficult.

A very subtle game, that I think will reward multiple plays.  The point gradations are going to be small, so every decision can matter, and knowing the timing when to cooperate and when to sell out Poland, or even your own properties, is key.  The more I think about, the higher my estimation goes.  In fact, it's the first game in a while that I've thought a lot about.  

Beautiful board and attractive components (the bidding blocks feel great in your hands).  The three-player issue is mitigated here with two prongs. The semi-cooperative nature which prevents direct attacks on the leader/persecuted player and that the bulk of the points are not scored until the very end of the game and are not clearly known until the final enemy attack comes. It's tough to peg the leader.

I have a fondness for difficult rulesets, but this one is more irritatingly obtuse than enjoyably obtuse.  In need of a high-quality FAQ.

A well entwined semi-coop pièce de résistance for those seeking a challenge.  Vintage Wallace.  Players have to cooperate to establish some form of a revenue base before the enemies swoop in and plunder Poland to a pulp.

God's Playground has the Wallace trademark all over it. It's convoluted, a little rough, and above all quirky. Even though at times it seems he may have gone a little overboard here, the overall concept is pretty cool.

There is one part that I found disappointing: the special actions. Most of the 16 phases each turn are unchanging from round to round, but twice each turn you get the opportunity to do things differently from everyone else. Or you would if half of the options weren't unavailable and most of the rest useless to you at any particular point in time. The foreign invasions also seem a little weird at times but this is the single most grating aspect.

The dice-based combat resolution can produce major swings but in general that is something you can plan for to an extend, and it's also rare that only one player would be at the receiving end of a particularly bad result so that short-term alliances are a frequent occurence.

Excelente juego de control de àreas. El factor suerte , por cierto presente, tiene mecanismos de atenueaciòn (como es la participaciòn del rey y el modificador de los cañones) 
Es un juego muy bien pensado en el que si descuidas cualquier parte del tablero te afecta ... 

El ùnico punto debil (esto es muy personal) es que es solo para 3 personas .. lo que para mi lo hace un juego muy dificil de que llegue a la mesa (generalmente hay mas de 3 personas)

Pre-order arrived Oct 2009 - First Impressions.  Lots of fun on our first play.  Almost feels co-operative at times, but with the threat of being left all alone at any time.  Ruleset/Turn Sequence is fairly simple to follow step by step.  How to win is where the compelexity arises. Initial thought: Much better 3-player game than After the Flood. 8/10

I've only played this once and I liked it a lot, but only serious gamers need apply here.  It only supports three, has an incredibly longwinded and confusing rulebook, and hits the 3-4 hour mark.  I think it is a great experience/strategy game, but definitely not for the faint of heart.

Intriguing game.  Really weird game.  Needs another play to weigh weird-good against weird-bad.  The big unanswered question is whether it's worth the effort involved in all the die rolling and cube processing.

The interesting part of the game is the complex tangle of aligned and opposed interests that is constantly in flux, throughout the board.  Learning to read, manipulate, and react to that tangle is clearly the main task before the players.

I dislike the way that the tiebreaking for the king's army is handled.  My feeling is that a player who goes hard for this but comes up short is punished too severely.  I'm also suspicious about all the special rules for handling the Ottomans on the final two turns.  Is all that extra chrome really necessary?

Very unusual game of dice rolling and bidding.

This is weird one and probably not everyone would enjoy it but it is definitely worth giving it at least one try. Seems to be susceptible to group thinking and often ends up in the same way (two regions surviving, most often those are Ukraine and Lithuania) which can be frustrating until you play it few times more and learn how to counter different strategies.

I like it more, the more I play. Recommended.

The fact is that many dire things will happen to you if you end up one cube short in an area, and that that one cube shortage can easily be the result of random/blind things that are nearly impossible to predict.

I also suspect, as some other players have commented, that trying to defend your Polish holdings is a high-risk crapshoot, while spending your cubes on Jesuits, majority votes, and cashing in money for VP are the only worthwhile things to do.  Possibly you can add in a token campaign to 'count coup' and score a bunch of VP for not actually stopping an invasion because you had a cube there and no one else did.  Building up troops by spending your money and your cubes makes you the sucker - you defend holdings of the players spending their money and cubes for direct VP that can't be crushed by invaders.  Now, theoretically you could defend just your holdings and let the others burn, but there is just far too much randomness for that to work in practice.  The fact that you get a minimum income for having no holdings that isn't substantially less than you will get by defending holdings feeds into the nonsense.

The thing that really killed it for me was the Confederation special action.  Essentially, the 3rd place player becomes the second or first place player, for a paltry cost.  You can block this if your blind block placement had one more cubes than the last place players placement - in each of the 5 provinces.  ESP might help you here.

BTW, you can buy this game for just an arm AND a leg, and you can play it with four players IF you go and provide your own pieces for the fourth player.  

I didn't rate it as broken due to all of the false choices buried in this game, but I suspect it is.  What happens if someone doesn't play the sucker and play defense?  Everyone gets 2VP a turn for gold, and whoever wins the most blind majority votes claims victory?

Not much of a wargame really. Also, people who are not interested in cooperating can get a good score, so what is the point of cooperating? Annoying is that whoever bid highest for the Polish Army is king, the player to his left is automatically player 2, even if he did not invest in the Polish Army...

This one is special and has a unique role in my collection.  Players have a shared interest in protecting Poland while at the same time trying to generate VP for themselves.  An interesting balancing act that presents some wonderfully challenging decisions.

RATING: 5
CLEARLY undeveloped game.
It seems very good at first: original (as usual in Wallace's case) and full of interlocking mechanisms.  This last aspect remindes the absolute state of art: Perikles.

BUT:

1.) the game is INSANELY random.  Final scores of players (and the matter who is the winner) are VERY susceptible to atomic actions (resulting in 1 cube (of MANY present in the game) being not here but there), which are hardly controllable (if at all).  The same goes for invasions/expanding of enemies in last turn - one less/more cube here or there as a result of an invasion, can turn the scores of players upside down..
Exactly the same case with surviving estates in the last turn - complete luck which of them at the end of the estate tracks will survive and which won't and you can build them in crazy locations hoping that they will survive when enemies' troops cancel each other out.  And that happens :-(  Uncontrollable.  Sheer luck deciding about the winner.  

2.) The game seems to fall always in the same tracks: estates developed and surviving in Ukraine (especially!) and Lithuania, while Great Poland and Little Poland are neglected as too difficult to defend.  Yes, you can try to agitate the others to work together in G.P. and S.P., but who cares where there are so easy points in Ukraine... :-//  You cannot execute your own strategy (like defend G.P. and L.P. - because you can't do it on your own) and you have to adjust to other players' thinking (like when they go to Ukraine, you also have to).  Hopeless.

3.) The most annoying Liberum Veto mechanism puts me off.  Yeah, it was annoying in the real history, but the game should be playable above all.  And Liberum Veto cancels your strategy of winning in many regions and cancels many options of the game (without discs in Seym you cannot do several things).  Liberum Veto was supposed to strengthen the flavour of the game, but turned out to be very very _gamey_ instead...  Why not use it when your opponents lose more VPs than you?  Grrrr...  I don't like it.

Our first game was marred by dozens of rules questions (many of which remained unanswered despite numerous attempts to locate the answer in the rules), which led to a frustrating experience. The player aid sheet is woefully lacking and the board, the player aid sheet, the rules and even the examples contradict each other in more than one place.

The bit of a game I was able to discern under all this didn't impress me much. Going with the BGG guidelines of letting the rating reflect my desire to play again, I would have to go with a 4 or 5 or so. I suspect the "real" game underneath is worth a 6 or 7 or so in my book, though.

GP is shock full of little fiddly special rules: The rules for the Habsburgs/Ottomans in particular are a mess of turn-specific exceptions. The Treefrog insistance on all-wooden bits seems a strange and unfortunate decision here. At least the board is nice (or at least, it isn't as toe-curlingly bad as the Wensleydale one ;) ).

I'd like to play the game again, as the second time around I will understand the flow of the game better - the rules in this one are a bit much to grasp the game on the first play.

Played twice.  Rating shall be unchanged.  I'll probably end up playing it a few more times.  Didn't really improve on strategy from the first game.  My armies sure did a great job falling over, though!

One play only (and a couple of solo run thoughs), but would like to play again.

Heavily abstracted war/political game with only 4 turns, but a lot of steps in the turn sequence. None of the steps are particularly complex, but the challenge comes in assimilating them all to form a plan.

There are essentially only 5 spaces on the board, but each has its own challenges and opportunities.

Plenty of options for stiffing the other players.

Attractively produced - the first time I've seen wooden wargame chits in a game! The artwork for the Polish-only 4 player version looks even nicer.

Main issue is the slack rulebook, with contradictions between the rulebook's text, the rulebook's illustrated examples, and the information on the board. There is also unclear terminology (normally 'Polish army' seems to mean 'King's army' but sometimes it appears to mean the players' armies), and a number of situations that come up in play not being covered in the rules. Makes learning the game harder than it needs to be, and means play is slowed down by uneccessary interpretation queries. Frustrating, and avoidable.

23.10.2009: Some comments after reading the rules. Lots of phases and things to do, but in the end not too complex. Would say that [i]Waterloo[/i] is the most complex Treefrog game to date, not this. The Ottoman and Hapsburg special rules for turn 3 and 4 are a bit messy, that section of the rule book could certainly benefit greatly from a re-write. Hope to try this one soon, looks like fun!

16 game phases must be a new record even for Martin Wallace. God's Playground is a convoluted three-player only affair that even the author describes correctly as his most 'experiential' game. In many phases you rather go through the motions than actually taking decisions. The interesting part is the strategic tradeoff between investing in Poland's defense or your own glory and wealth. What appears to be plentiful options comes down to a few repeated choices as many choices are only available later, once per round or not any more. Unluckily, the experience didn't really grab me. Two of Poland's regions were defended heavily, everything else went down the drain. The dreadful Ottoman/Habsburg special rules had no effect other than a flood of Ottomans first invading Habsburg and then Little Poland that already was devastated. In sum God's Playground has too much chrome for too a small effect.

RATING: 6.5
I'm a little torn here.  I decided to finally rate the game even after the feeling I need to play more games of it.

It seems like a game I really should like, but there's some things nagging me.

The first is that there are a few things that are just too unclear with the rules that don't seem very easy to figure out.  The images in the rules were a great idea, but they needed a few more "before and after" type examples. The Habsburg/Ottoman special events in the final turn are just too confusing.  Add to that there's plenty of things that rely on memory (was there fighting n this region? Did we drive them back) that end up being tricky for tired people on a long night of re-looking at the rules.

The other thing is the constant waves of rolling.  Almost seems too much to me unless I'm in the mood to roll a big pile of dice.  I think this might be lessed in future games, but I'm not sure how often I'm going to have to play it to not be following and going "Ok, now we're rolling to attack these guys, right?  Or are they attacking us?  Which pile o' pieces?".  One radially small thing I think would help would be to use different colored dices for infantry and cavalry.

That being said, i could see some folks saying luck is too much of an issue in this game.  I don't think that's true in the way most folks think.  The trickiest part of this game is choices the other players make seem to have a radical influence on some of your investments, so to speak.  Very similar to El Grande.  You combine that with the little bit of luck elsewhere and you need to keep on your toes.  I certainly think I made a few key mistakes that might have given me a huge handful of points at the end of the game. 

So, for now my gut feeling is that this is a game I could really like, with a few less special rules and maybe with one less phase of play.  (I'm thinking the expansion stuff could have been modified or have soldiers remain on the board or something.)

Definitely one of Wallace's better games, this game's a combination of area control and Stronghold, with an ever-so-slight whiff of Pandemic (the enemy expansion bit.) 

The incentive to cooperate isn't perfectly obvious at first, but believe me, it becomes so pretty damn fast as the Tatars and Ottomans start beating down your door. One of the subtle pleasures of the game is when you get really hosed with numerous invasions, you can play your enemies off against each other, and if you get it just right, sometimes cancel each other out completely. 

As per usual in the Wallace oeuvre, actions and money are tight, and this is maybe not the game that you want to take out if you're gaming with two friends with analysis paralysis - there's a lot going on, a lot of minutiae to account for, and it doesn't help that the rules are really badly written. I mean, monstrous bad. Once you start playing it runs pretty smoothly, but it's like reading 16 pages of run-on sentences: "Then you do this, and if this happens, then you do that, and then do this, and that, and take an Estate action, and add up victory points and here's how..." 

There are only four turns, each with around 15 steps, so I can see how a flow-of-action summary would be difficult, but nonetheless, it's important, and the flavortext and historical notes, while fascinating, don't really give you a great handle on the game.

RATING: 9
"The first time I played God's Playground we all held off the invaders and it felt like a reasonable classic Wallace area control /engine type of game. The second time one of the three realized how it was meant to be played, it's not about protecting Poland, it's about making sure the other regions get destroyed more than the one's you've invested in, but not so much that it spills over into your investments. It's the subtle table talk, treaties, and vetos that get you there. Watching my game fall to pieces has never been more enjoyable exercise in game mechanics (and history). 

I remain frustrated at not having played it again yet. Fair warning -although each part of the game turn is straight forward in itself; ~13ish steps are brutal to learn and it takes a while to put it together." earlier comment that will do as a starting comment here

Update: 2014 - I got to teach and play this again recently. it remains in my mind a work of genius that rewards repeated play but it's more the sort of game that you play and revel in once or twice in a year - not every week.

After a very vicious game where the Sejm was disbanded 3 of 4 years which led to mass destruction of Poland, the consensus appeared to be that this is a game of too many little pieces and exceptions.  The game flows fairly well for the most part, but the attempt to keep so many aspects of historical "accuracy" in gameplay can be difficult to follow.  The rule set left me with a glazed over feeling upon my first attempt as well.  After playing through completely once, I reread the rules and found a couple errors that we made - not that it would have made a huge difference in the outcome.  There is an aspect that everyone needs to work together to keep Poland free of invaders, but that gets put up in battle against self interests (which later makes people pay when the the invaders spread to adjacent territories - talk about hell to pay!).  There is quite a bit of dice rolling in this game - but I'm not certain if the randomness is covered up over time or not - as one horrendous roll can make you pay several years in a row potentially!  This game is quite an experience - one I cannot quite decide if I enjoy or not!  I do know that I actually want to play again...and see if the incentive to keep the Sejm together is ever there in any circumstance.  It just seems to me that if someone is not in the Sejm and has little provinces under control, there is little incentive to help the mother country instead of letting things go to hell.  

Second play was much more positive for Poland as estate values remained high as we worked together to keep Poland free of enemies.

Martin Wallace is hit or miss for me. I love struggles and liberte, but think AoS is only average and that things like way out west should have been better tested. 

What I do like is that he has a bunch of 3 player games and This one is pretty good. It is a euro but it does have direct player interaction. I can, at my own expense, directly hurt your chances for scoring. But with 3 players there is always this rock paper scissors thing going on between the players. Also in this game if you don't work together a little bit then Poland get over run and it O's really hard to score any points.

Based on a partial play "learning game". The two of us who were learning it thought it was so tedious we asked to stop. I'm not averse to complex games, but this has a massively long sequence of play that only gets repeated four times, so it is "then you do this, and then you do this, and then you do this".  I didn't feel connected to what I was doing as a simulation of the period. It just felt like a drawn out set of mechanics. 

I guess I wanted more of a wargame and less of a Euro.

Don't see much connection with RoR as Wallace claims was his inspiration, but the game is ok.

3 player only, semi-abstract strategic wargame from Martin Wallace. The game is very theme heavy but relatively straight-forward. MW says that it was influenced by Republic of Rome and like RoR there is both a need to co-operate with your fellow players whilst also competing with them. Unlike RoR, where the game can defeat the players, one player will always win GP. The game very subtley draws even the most co-operative players into conflict; nothing is divisible by 3 (5 regions, 7,5,4 estates per region, 2 cities, 8 land managers, 5 seats in the Sejm [parliament]) so players cannot simply divide up the resources equally and play their own game. There's also lots of ways of stabbing your opponents in the back (libertum veto, confederation or simply agreeing to do one thing and then doing something different). Ominously, Poland's enemies keep threatening it's borders and the players livelihoods (your agricultural estates). An excellent, relatively heavy, simulation with lots of player interaction.

Oh my. Well, this is Martin Wallace through and through: a historical theme, convoluted rules, shifting alliances, brutal system, weird tacked-on elements here and there. It seemed rather difficult to fully grok the system on our first play, and it didn't help that we were doing the 4-player variant, which is playable but not really what the game was designed for. I am starting to tire of the unfriendly, opaque design elements that always make their way into his games: do I really have to write off my entire first game because I made some boneheaded mistake I'll never ever make again? Why not just design the flexibility to make such mistakes out of the game, so players can focus on the interesting parts more readily? There's a design principle I think I read from Seth Jaffee that if you find all players doing the same thing to start the game (e.g., taking money), then just design that into the game (e.g., start them with extra money). That's certainly not happening here. Live and learn. There's also dice, and one player rolled snake eyes twice in a row (which is horrible in this game); he won't be playing this one again.

Nonetheless, I found the game system intriguing enough to want to try again. The semi-cooperative aspect of it felt unique, and we did so poorly that it seems like there's a lot to learn in vastly improving our play. The historical theme seems even stronger in this one than it is in some of his other titles, and descriptions of historical inspirations for the rules can be found through out the booklet. As such, my continuing interest in this is probably temporary, just to figure out the system a little better and experience the historical flavor a bit more. After that, I can see this becoming annoying, as the luck and chaos of the dice, blind bidding, and unpredictable board state make real planning seem rather far-fetched. Even Wallace himself says in the Designer Notes that this is his most "experiential" game, and that getting screwed is indeed a part of that experience. But for now, I'm in for another session.

I played once the three players version i'm a little disappointed, the game is a little territory control and negotiation, but it's great cooperative game , if you don't work with your friends you can easily smash the game and make all persons lose except you, i am not interested to play this game more than one time.

The theme of this game is well matched with the mechanics and it genuinely feels like you are fighting to keep Poland alive against the continual onslaught from neighbouring countries.
I like the implicit cooperative nature of the game and the gentle backstabbing elements which are quite unique in this style of game. The game also uses dice but their use does not add in a dominating randomness - which is essential in game with such a long run time (3 hours).

Decent enough game with some interesting choices, awful rulebook with some unneeded complications. The whole thing with the Ottomans/Habsburgs is just a confusing mess.

UPDATE: Feelings are more negative after a 2nd play. There are simply too many fidgety rules to remember to be certain you're even playing it right. The terrible rulebook definitely doesn't help. Repeated plays might get you some grasp of what's going on, but it's hard to do with a 3 player only game competing with other proven games good with that count.

This game is absolutely terrible. The turns are split up into sixteen easy to remember steps, with two special action steps consisting of eight additional easy to remember actions such as Danzig and Jesuits. How do I pay for these actions? Well, with one of the three different items you need to try and collect.

My complaints with this game begins with the rules. There are the rules, and then there are the exceptions to each rules. Oh, this country attacks this odd way for the first three turns, but normally on turn four. This country attacks normally on turns 1,2 and 4, but will attack this OTHER country on turn 3. Oh and this attack will take your cubes away, but this one won't. Oh, and this attack will negate the enemy cubes, but this one won't. Ugh.

Next is the dice and random unit placement. You have tiles that determine how many of your influence cubes go into a region. With everyone placing these at the same time, you never can be sure if you're going to get majority. Next, the dice determine the strength of the enemies you will face, which occurs after you place your influence, and after you must decide what else to spend them on. Meaning, you will have to just hope that the influence you have left will be enough to let you take care of the armies you'll have to face. Then, you need to attack the enemy, but your armies hit at 1/2 or 1/3 and have a 1/6 chance of being destroyed. Your armies also disappear at the end of the round, so you have to buy them again later. So, no chance in building up your forces. The enemy forces get almost overwhelming by the end of the game, so your small forces will not be enough to defend against them. Which brings me to the final luck aspect. Diplomacy. It will cost you an influence in your region, your voter guy from the region (meaning you'll need to have won it at the beginning of the round), and a random amount of money anywhere from 4 to 14. I don't think I ever had more than ten after the first round. Just the variance is absurd.

No, I am not playing this again.

This is a game where you play as Polish princes during a time when Poland was getting in invaded by everyone always. In this game, you place settlement tokens into areas and try to fight off the invasion cubes of the enemy forces. You are playing semi-co-op in terms of fighting the enemies, but really you are just out for whatever points you can grab before the hordes overtake everyone. It's a wonderful, brutal euro points grab game. One of the most fascinating twists of the game comes from any player's ability to evict all the government cubes from the box, which severely hampers player's ability to mitigate the invasions. To stop this from happening you want to arrange it so other players think they have more to lose than gain from taking this action.

The game has a lot of "phases" during the 4 rounds, but the phases run quickly and many are just bookkeeping updates. Combat is dice based, so randomness happens in this game. I'm ok with it in this case because it's absolutely a game of trying to get punched less than other players.

This is one nasty piece of work. The only way for Poland to survive is for all players to work together to make that happen (and even then its not assured). However, to do so you have to sacrifice some VP earning actions for the sake of everyone. If one person decides to make a grab for VP's on his turn he ends up sacrificing everyone else to invasion and destruction. That pisses off the other players and pushes them toward the same path, leaving Poland to get creamed. You then hope you have more surviving infrastructure then everyone else to carry the game. Nasty, can leave bad feelings so be careful. Reminds me of Princes of the Renaissance in that regard.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
With only 1 play I can at least SEE what's going on. Maybe a few more special exception than necessary but a good game overall. More play would likely bump this up to an 8.

It may be possible for 1 or more players to 'break' the game. Put out 15 cubes/turn (1 of each) with the 0 on the Polish Army. 1st turn build 7 Estates (13 cubes, varying income) and 2 Estate Mangers. Last 3 turns place 5 Estate discs (9 cubes, ), play Jesuits (5 cubes & 7 VP, play Estate Management (1 cube) on lowest Estate in the 'safest' region (for likely +2 in income). Extra income goes to VP. If income is ever 20+ then do fewer Estates so Jesuits can be done twice. Build no armies, defend nothing. (Alternatively, just take as many Jesuits as you can foregoing some Estates, Estate Managers and Income VP.)

Swamp the map with Estates and take the Jesuits every chance you can. (Of course there are variations on no armies/no defense VP greed strategy.)

Assuming that nothing I'm proposing violates the rules then I'll never play this game again because I'll want to try this 'strategy'; and this is a d**k strategy. One sure result will be that this pseudo-cooperative game will become vindictive as there will be a 2-on-1 'anybody-but-the-d**k' play mode.

If 2 players do this I think the game collapses. So if either a player can win this way or if the game collapses: 1.

Great game once you play through a couple of times and having BGG as a resource helps rules understanding a lot. I would either remove the city rule as it is a bit too strong and can throw the victory points tally too much. I think a similar system could work for Roman empire with an ability to take your own army and fight the others for the control of Rome as an addition.

I would also add, like a lot of games, this needs to be played by people who enjoy the history and game mechanics. It is easily spoilt by players who have to win at all costs.

Excellent game.  It's taken our gaming group a few plays to get the hang of how best to play, but we've enjoyed each game.  I think a sign of a great game is how much time you spend after a game discussing what happened and how things could have been played differently.  There's a lot of tough decisions and it's hard to figure out who is in the best position to win.  The last turn can be quite chaotic.

--Oct2009-- It provided a fascinating (and relatively unsuccessful) first play.  It was cool; I'd love to try again.  But we really didn't do very well keeping Poland alive.  On the other hand, it's not essential for the game for Poland to stay alive, so it's fairly compelling to try the (somewhere between "ridiculously" and "delightfully") chromed ruleset again.
--Apr2010-- A second play - this time fairly successful.  Again, I come dead last.  But the game is increasingly compelling:  it works well, and there are a lot of things to consider and balance.  Trending up.

RATING: 8
The need to rely on others helping you as they help themselves while having to judge exactly how much promoting your own position will help that of others make this a very exciting balancing act; the highs and lows created by the considerable luck factor also make it nail-bitingly tense. It's not one for those who dislike dice: despite the physical appearance and gameplay (combination of long-term planning and tightness due to limited actions/resources) of a strategic Euro, it has to be partially played as an experience game. All in all, a very fine encapsulation of what went wrong for the Rzeczpospolita and a wonderful game for the trickiest of player numbers (three).

Unusual game.

My first impression is I didn't like being at the mercy of the other players to defend there section of Poland.  Having reflect on it is is a little Struggle of Empires in that you have to play the players more than the board and guess what they will do for you and will not.  I didn't get the power of letting two armies wipe each other out until the end of my first play.

Needs another play.

RATING: 5
Although it can be procedure-y with some confusion regarding the Hapsburg/Ottoman rules, this game hits the spot as a semi-cooperative political/war game--at least for a few plays. 

The rules may seem daunting with lots of cubes and disks and tokens shuffling here and there, but after a play or two, this is all worked out, the steps come naturally, and everything holds together quite well organically. 

Then you can begin to really explore some strategies. A deep game that's not hard to learn, plus a blast to play with the right people. You really feel like you're Polish nobles, grudgingly aiding one another at times, other times competing ruthlessly, other times celebrating great victories over mutually-hated enemies.  

That being said, still limited in replay value for me personally, as the encroachment of enemies is pre-programmed thus creating similar endgames each time played.

Rating based on a play in Boże Igrzysko - polish edition supporting 4 players. The premise is great, I dig the theme (obviously, I'm polish), as always in a Wallace game there are some interesting mechanics reflecting depicted reality, and I really, really like having to cooperate with other players in order not to lose. However, for a heavier game, the basic dice fight mechanic feels out of place as if taken out of Risk and is quite irritating. So are the rules, which don't handle well particular (but not uncommon) cases such as what happens when several invaders spill to neighbouring provinces and face each other.

I put a lot of work into learning the rules for this in the week before playing. I still don't quite know how the Hapsburg thing works, but on the whole it all makes sense once a game is under way. Came in a solid third, having failed to see which provinces were best to 'invest' in on the first turn, or at least that's my excuse. Even getting solidly beaten was not unenjoyable, and I would like a chance to have another shot at this. Very headachey, though, and seemed a bit more laboured than Byzantium.

RATING: 8
I love a game with a good historical theme that doesn't get bogged down in overly complicated rules and instead focuses on interesting gameplay. This is one of those games. There's a lovely balance of mechanics going on here. Area majority in regions with different threats that change from turn to turn. Cube expenditure (from a pool that's never quite enough), that weakens your ability to defend an area and control an area in the future, all for a multitude of short term benefits that you have to choose between. Ah, lovely.

Because you can't save more than four money going into the next round you're forced to invest and defend these estates from the beginning of the game. Poland needs you and money defends Poland. There's enough dice rolling that although fortunes swing they also tend to even out. The way the individual player armies mix with the Polish Army is very elegant, as is the determination of the the Polish army size and who gets to use and abuse them first. Dice combat is simple, quick and quite amusing to watch as well as participate in. Jesuits might seem like a no brainer, but who has the money or nobles (cubes) and a special action to spare to buy those points? People! The Russians are coming… and the Ottomans... and the Habsburgs... and the… poor, poor Poland.

I found the rules very easy to digest, but the style they're written in begs for the use of a printed copy and a highlighter pen. Some important questions that crop are buried within blocks of text, but they're not hard to find when you go looking.

The game feels very thematic to me, in a simple beginner's guide to Polish history way. That's fine for my level of Polish history knowledge. More detail would be lost on me, but five regions with estates being built closer to the borders constantly at threat of marauding hoards of neighbours… that I can understand. That I can lose myself in for two hours for a game that's using history as a setting rather than as an historical simulation.

Speaking of playing time: The game is quite straightforward. Rolling a lot of dice chews through a bit of time, but experienced players are going to knock an hour off the initial playtime and get through this in two hours if they don't dawdle. That really sells it for me because it fits as a first part of an evening game, but feels like you've played something really substantial and memorable.

My only doubt in rating it so highly is that I'm not sure after a few plays whether I'd start playing it the same way. Now, the game will certainly not play the same - the dice driven events do mix up the threat from game to game, and estate placement will probably be different from game to game, battles will be more or less successful from game to game, etc. What I mean is scoring wise it'll be up to the players to see how much they want to experiment and try new things. A big chunk of points are made though a success majority in fighting off the invaders. Players will compete here and some estate holders will be reasonably happy even if they don't get the majority of cubes in the invader's box. But from game to game this constant competition for these points is going to repeat itself and I'm not sure how long that will hold my interest or whether I'll settle on what I see to be the best path. That said, I'm certainly not going to tire of it anytime soon.

Martin Wallace has shown once again what a diverse and productive designer he is. Another historical setting. Another well fitting group of mechanics. More cubes. Excellent entertainment!

When you read the rules of [i]God's Playground[/i] you feel overwhelmed and you foresee a too fiddly and unnecesary complicated game. After all, there are sixteen phases on each turn!! And some of then with a bunch of different options!! Then, you start to play and at the beginning you feel lost and that it is impossible to have a full vision of the game to come up with some kind of strategy. But after a few turns everything fits in order, the game flows pretty well and you begin to experience a great challenge that is immersed in a well done historic simulation, as we are used with Wallace. Even the flavor speacial rules about Habsburgs and Ottomans, that you may have thought that probably would cause some problems, work smoothly. Still, luck has a big part for a game of this weight, because some bad dice rolls can turn your most feared enemy in a deadly machine, or leave your well built army with empty hands, but in the long run it equalizes good enough. Wallace tries to prevent runaway leader problems practicly reseting the forces each turn, as in [i][url=http://www.juegosdemesacr.com/cms/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=152&Itemid=1]After the Flood[/url][/i] but not as savagely, achieving in such a way a very balanced three players game; a task in which it is not easy to success.

Hmmm. One solid game (with almost no errors for once) and I'm not sure what to think.  GP is a very good game, I am certain of that -- but even in Wallace's best games there's that rough edge which you wonder if it will blow up into a full-size fatal flaw.  I got that feeling again here, and it irks me.

Still, it served up everything I asked for: jostling for position while desperately trying to cooperate against the system.  One highlight -- after a three-way tie for King on the last turn, I convinced everybody to let me win the tie-auction for 1 money through some cajoling and threatening to force everyone to bankrupt themselves stopping me.  Any game that allows that kind of play in this context is AWESOME.

Update: the comments below obviously never became true, since this game is up there in my most played games (Hot) for the last 2 years. It has seen over ten plays and it continues to surprise even though how the enemy reacts is seriously scripted: there is enough going on to make each game feel fresh. Hence I even upgraded my rating for this gem.

I upgraded the game after playing it for the fourth time. I't such a tence game, where everything can and will go wrong from time to time. It's also a game that allows you to strategize before play and forces you to be tactical during play. It takes a lot of time though (3,5 hours in our group). So it probably won't be played too often.

I can't figure out whether to give this a 3 or a 7.  The problem is that there is no risk to it.  Nothing bad happens if Poland "falls", in fact invaders just cancel out other invaders.  Because you can win with the whole country overrun, means that this just comes down to raw point accumulation.

It is a great game when it works, but I'm concerned about the economy.  There is too much of a disincentive not to invest in the betterment of Poland.  Money seems better spent on Jesuits that on troops (the return is a bit higher with the troops, but FAR from a sure thing).  Dice are chancy Jesuits aren't.  Churning VPs from the majorities and the Jesuits combined with money earned off of Danzig (perhaps even best served saved and turned in for VPs) seem far more reliable.  Perhaps this is only a second place strategy, but then it means that first and last come down to luck.

I also think that the game is heavily determined by the last two rounds.  So much is swept clean off the board, that it all seems futile to build when you don't score until the end.  Plus, if you don't build anything, you don't have to try and defend it. Were it not for the cool blind allotment question mechanism relying on a two stroke turn, I'd say that the first turn could be cut out entirely.

I'm curious what the breakdown of which special actions get picked by experienced players.  I have my suspicions that some are just tagged on as fixes.

With the all or nothing reward system of invasion, it often makes more sense to not spend any money on troops. Things get really screwy when one person sees the inefficiency of creating a position in Poland.  I feel that when one person takes the high road and avoids buying troops then much of the joy is removed from the game.  Sid Sackson is rolling over in his grave by not awarding some second place compensation.  I don't want to play a wargame where after a battle you say, I should have just kept the money for VPs rather than wasting them on risky troops for a small VP profit margin.

The diplomacy treaty can be crazy expensive and still is risky.  Better to worry little about your property (it will probably be destroyed no matter what you do) and spend the couple extra bucks for Jesuits.

I really want to like it, and I love it when it works correctly, but it so easily can not.  I hope that I'm wrong about what I perceive is a screwed up economy.

Finally got around to playing this a couple of times. The rules are relatively simple without the chrome. But the chrome is pretty much indispensable, and it makes the rules very complex. This is not a fun game to teach.

I like the balance between cooperation and competition, allowing the players to decide whether the game will be "earn the most glory in Poland's climb to greatness" or "manage to eke out enough of a living to spare an estate or two as the various enemy hordes ravage the country". There's some incentive to be selfish, but in a three-player game the player who breaks from the pack first can expect some nasty retribution from the other two. The mechanics are an excellent fit for three players.

I would prefer a bit less luck o'the die--it is possible for an odd combination of results to determine the game, more or less.

RATING: 8.5
A very thematic, nicely balanced, fun 3-player (only) game, with a kind of atrocious rule book! Keep in mind that it can be a dicefest -- don't go looking for a HEAVY game here!

The actual rules are pretty straightforward, except for the Ottomans and Hapsburgs -- wow, those rules really REALLY need to be rewritten!! If you can get past that, however, the game is actually a lot of fun! Despite the relatively lengthy play time, it isn't terribly heavy (or maybe it feels lighter because there is a fair bit of randomness due to the die rolls?). And it works very well with three -- usually a tough number to balance -- by having players fight external threats while competing with each other for limited resources (estates, army placements, enemies to attack for varying VPs). 

--- I wrote this. If I ever get to play again, remember! ---
If I understand the rules correctly, couldn't we restate part of them as follows:
Quote:
At the start of each turn, place as many cubes/heads in ALL enemy boxes as indicated on the board for that particular turn. In the Events and Enemy Attacks phases, place additional cubes if required (i.e., if you rolled the number for that box). When players attack enemies, and they place their own (or the King's) cubes in the enemy boxes, match each cube placed with an enemy cube (if present) and set the pair aside in one corner of the box. When Enemies Attack (including Turn 3 Ottomans attacking Habsburg), all the remaining unmatched enemy cubes/heads move into the target region (for Turn 3 Ottomans target=Habsburg). During Enemies Expand, use enemy cubes from supply and/or from their enemy box as needed (if still short of tokens, divide the available ones equally between expansion targets). At the end of the turn, remove all enemy cubes in excess of Polish nobles (Turn 3 Habsburg has 2 'virtual' nobles).


I think it's simpler because
- you place starting tokens in all enemy boxes, not just Habsburg
- you don't have to do the math (number + enemy cubes - red - white - blue) to calculate attack strength; just move remaining cubes into Poland
- treat Habsburg as just another Polish region in Turn 3 (for Ottomans)
- no special expansion-cube-shortage rule; you always take cubes from enemy boxes and/or supply

Unrelated comment: all arrows from an enemy box are ATTACK arrows; only used in the Enemy Attack step. All arrows between Polish regions are EXPANSION arrows; only used during the Enemies Expand step. It would have been nice to use different icons for the arrows.

I am aware that there is a chance that there are so many enemy strength points in Poland that it is impossible to place the required number in the enemy box. I would guess, however, that the chances of that are VERY SMALL. Of course, I've only played once (with several rules errors) so I could be wrong.

I don't like the game. I understand that it can be a fun game for certain players but I find it too messy and confusing. I don't have any sense of control at all and I guess a lot of the game is about dice rolling. It has nice new ideas and it is very strongly themed but it simply didn't work for me as a fun time.

Players do the same thing over and over and the expansion rule is too much chaotic.

Weird 3p euro-wargame with many special-case rules in the name of historical verisimilitude. It's enjoyably chaotic, I suppose I would say -- between the blind bids, the dice and the interactions between various invading forces, it seems to do a reasonable job simulating the difficulties of a noble house in a time of great upheaval. Plans sometimes pay off and sometimes don't, particularly if a member of parliament chooses to exercise their right of veto...

It plays more smoothly than I expected given its reputation for shoddy rules, but is also more wildly unpredictable. Very much an experience game.

It's quite long, and has about half a million tiny rules that are easy to miss or play wrong.  There's also a lot of reliance on dice which I really don't think belongs in a 3 hour game.  To have plans destroyed by bad rolls is a problem in such a long, heavy game.

But I actually liked it and want to play again.  It's not something I'm clamoring for, but I want to give it one more spin.

Very interesting, really thematic, the mechanics are tied very well with the events being the subject of the game. I'm from Poland, so for me it's even more tasty, but other people who like the history of Europe will probably find it also very engrossing. There is some luck involved (the effects of the battles are resolved with simple dice throws) that can really change the scoring, but is does not destroy the strategical aspect of the game. The Polish edition (Boze Igrzysko) has much better board graphics than the standard Warfrog one. 

Number of plays: 2.

Great game with lovely 'how much can I push this, how much can I profit from others' mechanics. Feels a bit like Imperial in that aspect, but overall design is much more integrated.

Love the theme, very well done. 

Two drawbacks:
- rules for cossacks are funny but don't add much to the game. Could've been left out imho.
- rules for ottomans/habsburgs are clearly an attempt to 
'model in' the historics but fail by messing up the design unnecessary. On top of that, these rules (are amongst others) are not clearly worded in the rulebook (which is the weakest part of the package, as it leaves much to be argued about). Game has enough going as it is, no need to overcomplicate things.

But, overall, a great game! We had great fun trying to let others 'take the brunt' of attacks and weaseling out of tight spots.

If you like a bit of politics, chance and don't mind the 'screw you' mentality, this is a game right up your ally. Note though: it is NOT a wargame, it is a heavily themed euro with strong political maneuvring.

The first time I played this, I fell in love! God's Playground is much greater than the sum of its parts, and is one of the best gaming experiences I've ever had.

A semi-cooperative game, which weaves an intricate and interesting story. I have always enjoyed games that have a strong narrative, and of all the games I've played, this one has one of the strongest.

I will admit it won't be for everyone, but if it even vaguely ticks your boxes then this game is highly recommended by me!

First impression is positive. I'm not overwhelmed with options yet it's tricky to see all the implications of what I do. I was afraid of having a huge laundry list of actions to choose from and puzzle through, but you really don't. Perhaps, finally, another Wallace I like as much as Perikles? And maybe the first one that really makes the fluctuating estate/city value speculation thing work?

The military is nicely (mercifully) abstracted in that all battles are phrased as the Polish being the attackers: There is a cost to attacks and a risk of destruction of units, but if the attacks fail to destroy the enemy, the enemy's response is simple and deterministic and doesn't even affect the Polish military units. This game could've had twice as many die rolls but Wallace managed to spare us.

It's interesting how the apparent cooperative nature of the game (save Poland) is an illusion since the winner will always be whichever player fared the best, no matter what happened to Poland. But the effects of the enemy invasions are so severe that ignoring them (with the idea to save yourself) rarely seems viable. It seems like at most you could subtly, selectively drop the ball on defense to your own benefit. But I'm not sure what such opportunities even look like.

...A little strange how the game bails you out in a couple of ways. If enemy armies encounter each other in Poland, they slaughter each other. And enemies apparently evacuate Poland to the extent that players are exhausted.

In my first game the winner was decided by a player building a city in the Ottoman-neighboring province that had rarely been attacked (60-point city). It was a landslide win, though that player appeared to be in last place through the entire game. This alarms me a bit because only two cities can be built in the whole game. I wonder also if it trivializes the other means of getting VPs. One player took a gamble on bankrupting himself to build Jesuit schools in all five provinces, which gives you 7 points total. It earned a commanding lead at the time, but in hindsight...

Bottom line though is that this game gives me that feeling that a lot of interesting stuff is happening, without me having to do a ton of work. It doesn't get much better than that.

Update June 2014: one of the hardest games for me to rate. On the one hand, a frustrating overhead and it isn't player-driven, yet it's brilliant and weird and can create a great experience. Literally I could rate an 8 on down to a 3. Right there, it's got personality out the ying yang.

[u]Update:[/u] 
The last two plays and dropped the rating from a 9 to a 6. The game may be too chaotic to control enough to get those really sharp plays you get when the whole table knows a Wallace game, or this may be a very fine experience game but good for 5 plays, not the sort of play of a Brass or AoS. In our last two games, almost absurdly poor die rolls threw Poland into utter chaos. Not that Poland burning was bad in itself, but the game became a point grab rather than a controlled burn of Poland.

[u]Original comments:[/u]

I think there's enough general awareness of the theme, a concurrent defense of Poland beset by carnivores on all fronts and jockeying for power and wealth within Poland's internal politics. A wonky Wallace-esque asymmetrical scoring system seems balanced in his weird way, distributed across a myriad of actions and areas controlled, and choices to score both in ways that contribute to Poland's defense & ways that pursue more selfish gains instead. 

Wallace is quirky, but in this game he's outrageously kinky. Hidden in those kinks is a fascinating, multi-layered area control game, with the added dynamic that the security of these areas fought could subsume to invaders. Moves are overt signals wrapped in subtle what-ifs that feel like they ladder from every choice. I don't know how many times we looked at each other with a kind of wow at the power of the game to communicate. It is a marvel. 

There's room for maneuver, temporary alliances, misdirection, differention in area control yet deviously layered, rapid adaption, and if incentives don't hold a player within predictable potentials they can pull the carpet out from under you.

Strategically you can bury yourself deep under others in a low-point position and pull Poland down onto the more exposed positions of the ambitious. Or you can think your doing this and have the others collude to thwart it. You can focus on mobile & growing board-wide presence or build a stronghold and fight to hold it. And there's noogying your way in between these sorts of poles.

Wallace applies a compendium of mechanics. For example, placing estates in turn order on one hand and a neat hidden placement & simultaneous reveal for your nobles on the other. Then the nobles, tiny piles of, both elect governors via area control and then get pulled off the board, like workers placed, to pay for actions that are both board-wide and local to their area. Somehow, this rolls along smoothly in that off-center wheel way Wallace pulls off.

There are many different ways to represent your vesture, and so many ways to negotiate, fight, or wack-a-doodle the tactical advance and protection of your positional commitments, that there are many gambits and none proved to be "the way" to a win. Clear sailing, no. Entanglement in each other is just too dense. Potential for disaster, high. A terrific narrative arc. 

In the first two plays, it seems to hold many more.

It seems to be a good game, with lot of variants in playing. But rules aren't so simple for a boardgame and quite bad writen IMO, even if I like so much Wallace's games. So it's a first playing, quite long, but I think next time will be better, faster and funnier...so we'll see. After two new plays the game is really great, the best one for 3 players. Very interactive...lots of possibilities...a must have from master Wallace.

It all works, but we didn't find it to be very engaging. For one thing, the die rolls are too important - I don't mind a game with this much randomness, BUT it has to be either fairly short (much shorter than 2 hours) or it has to be an experience game with lots of color. This doesn't have nearly enough color.

Edit 2017: it's been 8 years since I played it and there are not much memories about it, except that the rules were confusing, so my conclusion is that it wasn't a very impressive game... Lowered to 4.

One play: first impressions are reminescent of those I had with Revolution: The Dutch Revolt, but without asymetric parties, not as epic and of course with dice. The way different mechanics are intertwined make for an interesting experience, and I'm already looking forward to the next play.

Despite a couple of rules that were difficult to reference during play, I think this game's reputation for complexity is undeserved. It's a stellar balancing act of self-interest and thwarting shared strife. For a game with 16 phases each turn, it sounds much more overwrought than it is. I enjoyed the balance. Some very mean actions are only available or advisable if you are far behind and want to see Poland burn. God's Playground is a truly unique game, particularly for Wallace, who has made quite a few unique games. Love it!

Quintessentially Wallacian.  Full of idiosyncrasy and historical nods, just like his other games.  Unlike his other games, this is not good as a game.  At its purest essence, this seems to be simply a slightly more complicated area majority game, which is a very crowded genre, and I'm not sure a multiplayer pseudo-wargame like this is really worth it.  I am willing to look past a bit of klunkiness in favor of historical flavor, but I recognize that not all others will feel the same way.  Every time I've played, players have spent more time feeling out the mechanics than forming a cohesive strategy.  Scoring is a chaotic free-for-all.

Holding out on rating until I play a full-length game. Also I suspect there were rules we didn't get or that were misunderstood. In any event my initial impression is one of piqued interest but only moderate hopes. There's a cool feeling of a lot going on, but I'm unsure of what will remain once all the smoke of novelty clears. Like so many Wallace games before it, God's Playground is about some level of Euro resource management (in this case hidden resource/action-point allocation) followed by dice battles.  Initial impressions of this one are better than for other vaguely similar games like Perikles and After the Flood, but that doesn't necessarily mean that I'll be adding this to my collection. Tentative 7.

It's not a bad game, but actually I was expecting something much more thematic. The theme actually comes through very little in the gameplay, and so it is just another "VPs optimization" game.

One of MW's more intriguing games.  As with all of them, this one has some luck of the dice involved with combat resolution but other than that it's a tight 3-player game with elements of cooperation, negotiation, and backstabbing.  It's a tight balance between placing nobles in areas to take actions and building up your estates which you'll want to protect for income and points.  Knowing when to take King for first player actions is as important as the special actions you'll want to take before your adversaries. I like it.  Still, the game won't be suited towards everyone.  It's certainly a gamer's game but with some luck, and it takes about 3 hours to play with three experienced players.

Really unique 3 player game.  I can certainly see the inspiration from Republic of Rome.  However, this is a much better game than Republic of Rome.

I like it a lot.  However, I don't mind chaos, dice rolling, or any some luck in my games (in fact, I prefer it).  So, this is right up my alley.

Game is also very thematic.  All in all, very well done.

The borrowed title certainly seems apt.

This is one of those Wallace games where I need to review the rules each and every time before playing, since there's no chance that I'll play the game often enough to get them down pat.

This isn't a mark against the game, but it does make it less likely that God's Playground will get to the table - since no one in my gaming group will spontaneously remember enough of the detailed rules to be able to sponsor a game on the spot.

In my gaming circles, if there's a game that we want to play, we'll schedule a session in advance so that we can brush up on the rules.  At the moment, however, God's Playground doesn't fall into the "worth scheduling" category.

[-]Tentative rating, based on a play that left us we serious doubts that we had all the rules right; however, I'm pretty sure this is a really cool game.[/-]  This [b]is[/b] a really cool game.  It's a Euro/war game in which the players compete against one another, but only [b]fight[/b] against invaders of their common nation.  Very interesting!  The downside, for me, is that it's still dice-based combat resolution, but strategic play mitigates the impact of ridiculously bad rolling.  (The winner of our second game kept rolling multiple ones, taking heavy, heavy casualties.  Yes, the winner.)  On coolness alone - and its fascinating ability to make you sincerely root for your opponents even while you try to undermine them - this game would be a 9 for me.  What keeps it down a bit is the complexity and trickiness of explaining the various contingencies.  I think I'm getting better at that, at least.  Well, and there are a few finer points of the rules only found in examples, the nice player summary, or (unfortunately) BGG forums; however, it's nothing that can't be resolved temporarily by player consensus.  Really, an excellent game.

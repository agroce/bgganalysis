Castrated version of Lowenherz.  Like a eunuch at the Sultan's Harem, it has it uses.  It is entertaining, is tarted-up to look pretty and can fan you when you need a light, breezy game.  The point is, it's not really going to satisfy when you need something substantial.

RATING: 7
A good eurogame for a change. This little gem is very confrontational, where a lot of the actions you make have a direct impact on the other players. At the same time the game is vey cleverly made so that you can never be backstabbed in one turn, you will instead see the (possible) "stab" comming, and you can then attempt to take measures to prevent it from cutting too bad. My rating of the game has dropped a bit because of some stuff I've read in reviews here on the geek that struck me as true based on the play I've had.

When I first saw photos of the game and later when reading the rules I was suspicious that it would be a bit dry but was suprised at how interesting and fun the game played.  The components when seen in person are very well designed and add a lot to create an atmosphere.  Fun and simple.  I like the scoring updates so you know exactly where you stand without too much thought.  Very elegant design.

RATING: 7
Basically a nice quite fast-playing game of conquest. For a hardcore wargamer the square fields feels odd and unnatural. The same goes for the way knights are placed in the kingdoms. They are a distraction and the power of the kingsdoms could be handled in another way. That's why I rate it a bit lower, than I would otherwise have done. On the other hand I like the way kingdoms are created, the limestones are placed, the random board placement and how kingdoms expand. This game should have been more war- and less Eurogamey, but keep its simplicity.

RATING: 8
Really good area enclosure game. Easy to teach and play. Plays in about an hour. Has enough strategic debth. Nice components and modular board. The game is abstract at its core but the colourful components manage to hide it. Acceptable (meaning low) amount of luck. I want to try it again.

Tentative rating after one play.  A nice area control game, where money is tight throughout most of the game.  I didn't appreciate how much of the strategy is in the initial setup placement.  If you've done poorly at that it's game over before the first turn.  We played with an experienced player, who was very good at leveraging the efforts of others to his own benefit.

Played twice both times with 3 players.  This game takes a little too long for players to "fence off" their first domains.  I also find the alliance cards too powerful.  This game is too card driven for my taste.  Maybe if the card limit was higher than 3 the game would be more interesting.

This game is rather brutal. Every turn is a strugle to beat off those who attempt to capture your territory. A bad start will have you floundering for the rest of the game.

Unfortunately we played a few rules wrong on our first play, so we'll have to try again. The second play went much better. With the rule corrections the game hummed along and everyone enjoyed it.

This game feels like it was made for me.  All the things I like in a game.
I like:
 - placing walls to create your domains
 - the elegant economy built out of controlling mines, selling cards, paying to use cards, and the price inflation as the game progresses
 - the beautifully drawn modular board
 - the straight foreward turn sequence
 - expanding your territory, cutting off other peoples territory, protecting you territory

My one issue with this game is that everyone MUST be on the lookout for the "final" domaine that is automatically formed when everyone else but one person has made domains around all their castles.  This "gimmie" domain can range from small to massive in point value and it can completely sway a game.  Whether created by accident or by sly experienced players, I feel that it goes against the spirit of the game.  I don't think it should be ruled out by variant, but I would recommend pointing it out to all new players. I would almost recommend specifically putting a castle out in the middle of the board and leaving it there for the sole purpose of disallowing the final domaine from sneaking up on you.

UPDATE:  I've lowered my rating down from a 10.  I really love this game, but the endgame breaks it.  Even when all players involved know about the "free final domain" problem it is almost impossible to stop.  Getting a large, possibly the largest domaine for free near the end of the game is a game breaker that goes against the spirit of the game, and usually sways the game heavily.  I've had games where the last place guy got the final free domaine, and was immediately launched from last place to winner, game over.  Dumb.

UPDATE 2: Lowered my rating from a 6.  See review.

I can't help but feel the deck isn't tuned properly.  Too many knights, too short and an odd distribution of fences and expansion cards.  Still fun and maybe more plays will reveal my error.

a good effert to bring a classic medieval setting to life. The game is clever and the mechanic flawless and fun to play.
Pity that the board itself could have been done much better: the 4th player is narrowed down until he dies during the 5th-6th turn; independently from player intentions. It's simply the board design that cannot keep up with this interesting gameplay: it lacks space, and it's unblanced.

Wanted to like this one - nice bits etc, but the game experience is less than satisfactory. If you don't draw green cards (walls) early you're screwed, if you get ahead with mines you'll win - and in multiplayer it makes more sense to hit the weakest player rather than bang your head against the strongest - making it painful for the player in a weak position (at least it ends quick). Many many more games I'd rather play than this one. *** Updated, traded my copy so it's unlikely I'll play this again

Virtually an abstract, the card play and bits present this as a mideavel conflict. Key to understanding is the placement of borders to create your domaines, which placements can also benefit your opponents. You must minimize the advantages that you provide for them as you develop your own lands. Conversely, one must exercise flexibility as other players create opportunities for you to grow. Moves fast with just one decision/action per turn. With scoring updated with each play, other players can assist to stop a runaway leader by pressuring his domaines from several points using walls and knights. Nice medium to medium-heavy game turning in at about an hour.

This is a surprisingly good game which grows on me with each play.  Initially dry and unintuitive, I've come to appreciate its subtleties more and more every time it gets to the table.  I've won and lost games at 50-3 and faced off where a single Dukat makes the difference at the game end.  Agonising choices and sweeping power changes truly make this game.

Interesting game that can become pretty cutthroat later on.  I have found that in a 4 player game, one player tends to get slapped down early, whether intentional or not.  Control of mines early on is critical to success, and any early competition can quickly put you out of this game.

Being the player "left alone" tends to be the best path to victory which is a bit of a flaw IMO.

Not a bad game, far better than Entdecker from Teuber's abandoned Catan project. I really like the way the cards are handled, where a card is used for its action and removed from the game, or is used to get money while leaving it for others to draw again. That simple mechanic drives so many player decisions, and adds an interesting level of strategy to the area control part of the board.

Getting a domaine early on is crucial, especially for generating income, so initial placement is very important. The deserted cards can also be incredibly powerful, and can swing the game quickly for a player who uses one. On the other hand, scoring throughout the game often feels neck-and-neck, so I don't think the game is imbalanced or luck-heavy.

I played Lowenherz recently, and I think i like the original better. But, this is a good, relatively quick area control game. After I get more plays in on this game I will most likely want to get the original Lowenherz. The orig. includes a nice negotiation mechanic for cards that is missing from Domaine.

I've played this quite a bit now, and I do think it is a substantial improvement over the original. Losing the haggling for actions is a good thing, I think, as it could be time-consuming and not entirely enlightening. The new buying/selling of action cards is very nice, scales better with different numbers of players, and is quicker. OTOH, this is still a brutal game, if you get behind the power curve early you're totally screwed, to a degree that I think really is not good (I can't think of a eurogame which is worse in this respect). I can't quite make up my mind on whether this is just a feature of the game or a problem. Domaine can in fact boil down to who gets picked on and who doesn't, which is a little unfortunate ... if we're going to go that way, I'd rather roll some dice and play a Star Wars Risk. I'm not absolutely convinced that that Domaine has enough money management or tactical interest to make it without the player interaction, and I'm similarly not totally convinced that the player interaction is of a good sort here. And with gamers, it can go longer than it wants to. On the other hand, it is quite a clever game, and you don't see many directly confrontational euros, so it's got something there. So I'm torn. For me, it hasn't stood up to time quite as well as I'd hoped; Elasund is a little more to my liking as a more competitive euro. All this is a bit of waffle, though; for what it is, Domaine is a very game. Just make sure what it is is what you want.

I like Lowenherz better because of the bidding aspect.  It's too luck of the draw in Domaine.  If you fail to draw walls early, you're screwed.  In Lowenherz, you choose what action you will take, and bid for it of someone else wants to take the same action.  I think Lowenherz a lot more fair, and definitely less luck oriented.

1 play.  3 players.  The increase in card costs as the game progresses seems just about right, but the game may depend too much on luck of the draw, though I can't say for sure just after one play.

Love it, love it, love it!  Screw your friends, play traitors and alliances, and watch out for huge neutral territories opened up in your space by a clever wall-push.  Much improved over the original Löwenherz; the original bidding mechanic is gone, replaced with buying and selling of action cards at fixed prices.

This game is good, as it has many features that are new and offers battlefield-like tactics and strategy.  We played a three player game, and it didn't work...at the end, a player fell in the position of kingmaker.  I think this game would only work with 2 or 4, and with 2 you need a dummy, which isn't too appetizing either.  I still don't see how you get around the kingmaking.  However, I like the card management idea in this game better than the one I've heard exists in Lowenherz.

This game is a little nuts. It's a wargame dressed up as area control. VERY confrontational. Domains creep up to yours from all sides. Some cards flip knights allegiance to another domain or people expand into your territory if you are weak. The endgame is insane with threats and opportunities everywhere. It is kind of fun, but I couldn't see myself playing very often.

The four player version of this game has Klaus Teuber all over it.  Tight resources, cramped spaces, and everyone gets all up in everyone else's face, trying to squeeze just one more point out of the remaining spaces.  Not only that, but there are great benefits to interacting with other players (much like Settlers' trading), even while it puts you in even more perilous positions.

I'd play this even more than Settlers.  It is definitely the superior game.

I didn't care for Lowenherz but I gave this a shot mainly because it just looked so damned pretty.  As far as I'm concerned, this re-working more or less fixed everything that I had a problem with in Lowenherz.  The only problem is there's a few chief strategies that if you miss, you'll get trashed later in the game.  That being said, the game rewards careful planning and nothing beats a good, competitive game of Domaine.  Good, good stuff.

Domain looks good. Rules are simple. Playing Domain feels different than playing a typical euro due the special border-mechanics.

Update: Currently Tichu is my only 10, but if any boardgame will hit 10, this is it. I tested that by playing 5 times in 2 days (having not played in a few years), and still itching to play more. It's true that a novice player can basically knock themself out by the time they figure out what's going on, but then game doesn't last much longer anyway. I also like the ability to "queue up" you cards, to sort of make a plan. I suppose I might be convinced to play the original Löwenherz (which I also happily own) over this, but only with players who are all very familiar with it, and who don't mind spending twice as long, for marginally more cut throat / less random gameplay. But the amount of randomness in Domaine actually hits the sweet spot for me. I like a little randomness, especially with private info, so that it can't be analyzed to death.

This is a bit less gamery than Löwenherz (in the action selection), but plays a bit shorter. Glad I have both for variety, but Domaine gets more table time due to taking 1/2 the time as Löwenherz.

This is a multiplayer territory claiming game from the designer of Settlers. Players are forced to discard a card (selling) to an open market if they run low on cash (primarily used to pay for the priviledge of using a card for its ability) or use a card, and then take a card either from the market (not a sold card) or from the deck.

Cards are mostly used to build or move fencing, to enclose regions near their markers (or to shaft other players) or to enlarge them.

Number of plays low but close.

I was looking quite forward to playing this game, being one of the last big 'old school' 999 Games titles I hadn't tried. The game is built around a nice subject: land grabbing by callous knights. This is translated into an area control mechanic whereby control is increased by playing the right cards. Unfortunately, locked up in that little word 'right' is a major rich-get-richer issue which means that if by some stroke of misfortune you don't get the right cards from the beginning&mdash;meaning that some other bloke will be more than usually lucky&mdash;you won't stand a chance: the draw deck is split into several groups, and every group is drawn to exhaustion before moving onto the next. The same problem plagues De Ontembare Stad, and is, in my opinion, a shitty way to introduce 'control' into something as random as a deck of cards. The lucky guy gets to spend less money to consolidate his areas, and is thus able to turn his attention to extending his army of knights and muscling in on the neighbours, as well as to pacifying provinces. The game actively promotes hitting on the little guys too because they are simply the easiest to grab land from. Oh, there is a nice mechanism which deducts points from players when they lose parts of their areas, but this does not make up for the cash flow imbalance. The game has good ideas, but a bad execution of them. Not a game I intend to play again.

Domaine relies on your opponents being as good as you are. If they are better than you, then you won't have any fun, and if you are better then they are, you won't have any fun. Then you have the problem with the luck of the draw, it always seemed that the cards I could draw weren't as good the others had.

I enjoy this game a great deal, though I can't claim to be all that good at it. Two pieces of advice for beginners: 1. In castle placement and early game, make sure you can [i]improve your income quickly[/i]. If you do not, odds are excellent that you will be buried in the mid- and late-game; Domaine is unforgiving in that regard. 2. Remember that "found a small kingdom quickly, then use expansion cards to make it grow" is an entirely viable way to claim territory, and in many circumstances a better one than trying to enclose a large area with markers all in one go.

Players form domaines by placing walls on the modular board to enclose territory. Completed domaines can then be expanded, even into your opponents'. Protect domaines by placing knights, which resist expansion. Actions are taken by playing cards that have a cost associated with them. Gain money by selling cards and controlling mines. Sold cards can be acquired by other players. Players score points based on the quantity and type of terrain enclosed in their domaines, as well as by controlling many mines of a single type. The winner is the first player to cross a specific point threshold or the player with the most points when the card deck runs out.

This is a sleeper. Definitely the type of game you can continue strategizing over after each play. Initial read of the board setup is key and card draw plays into strategy, but hand management wins over luck. Each game is different enough that it keeps the game feeling fresh. I can see how it can get a bit lopsided and one or more players can retain the upper hand in the game, but on an even playing field with experienced players, this game certainly holds its own.

Rating is based solely on one play:

I guess I'll stick with the old version of Löwenherz. In the one game I played I managed to become a runaway-winner because of some lucky card draws. This might not really be a problem since I normally do like a little "card driven luck". But in this case I know that there's a "Domaine-variant" (called Löwenherz) I like more.

I'm not sure what to think about this game.  After 1 3 player game, it seems to have a run away leader problem.  I was able to get 3 different mines early in the game.  Got the income advantage over my 2 other opponents.  Beefed up the region with knights.  Finally got the 4th mine and was generating 4 ducats/turn while my opponents were still generating 1ducat/turn.  So ultimately I was getting double the actions they were. Several times they were close to getting more mines, but I was able to expand my domain to keep them poor.

The game definitely has some nastiness to it...which isn't necessarily bad.  I felt a little guilty expanding all over the board....cutting opponents domains in half, stealing their towns and mines...etc.  I'll keep it at a 6 for now.  Maybe we had a rule wrong.  I guess if the alliance cards had popped up for them early, it would have been a different game.

I game pretty much every Wednesday at Coolstuff Game's open board game nights. Most weeks we have a nice cast of characters, among whom are people who mostly share my tastes, allowing me to frequently play games I enjoy. A few weeks ago, most of them were unable to show up. I was able to get in some good games of Crokinole (on my new board) and Washington's War, but eventually my options became limited. Jens, another regular asked me if I wanted to play Domaine. I was hesitant. Jens has different tastes than me, and while there are a few games we both appreciate, there are quite a few that we differ on. Additionally, he has a track record of periodically games that no one likes, him included. I checked the game out using geekbuddy analysis on my iPhone though, and found that had a reasonably good rating among my geekbuddies. So I decided to try it, despite my hesitation.

I should not have bothered. For one, a game of Hansa Teutonica started five minutes after I joined the game of Domaine (damn!), but also I found the game cute, but ultimately forgettable. While the game was short, it felt unsatisfying. Much of the board went unused, and it seemed that the decks should perhaps be bigger, allowing for more opportunity to develop a real strategy, rather than being tugged along by what you drew into your hand. After we finished, the others decided to play again, and I chose to sit out, playing no board game rather than bothering to play it again.

A reworked Lowenherz.  Players draft and play cards to create enclosed kingdoms on the board to score points and increase their income.  Income is needed to play these cards as well as position knights.  The messy bidding of Lowenherz has been removed, meaning everyone gets to play.  Nice anguish of counting money and making the most of your turns.  Works very well with two players too.  Excellent.

This is one that seems to really annoy women because points can be taken away!  I like the way the card deck limits actions a bit and puts a time limit on the game.  I find keeping track of the score and mine income a bit of a chore.  Overall, I think it's a neat game, but I'm not sure that I find it a lot of fun.  While I like it, but I think I'm more likely to reach for Elasund when I'm in mood for this type of game.  However, I also feel compelled to try it again, so my opinion may improve.

RATING: 3
This is a horribly-balanced "rich get richer" game disguised by a scoring mechanism that makes the final result look like a closer contest than it actually was. It's possible to quickly score a large number of points you did nothing to really earn -- and the game ends before the opponents who have been dominating all along can erode the ill-gotten gains.

The way the deck is stacked (similar to the shuffling of tiles in Tikal) is a clever mechanic. The pieces are pretty. But the game is completely unrewarding to play.

First play in 2015.  I enjoyed this quite a bit.  It's a blast from the past, with an exceedingly simple German-style design that feels very dated but was also a breath a fresh air in this land of Kickstarter crap and under-developed games.   There is one fiddly bit that is mildly annoying:  each player earns coins at the start of their turn, and then either gains more coins or spends coins.   And turns go fast.   So coins are constantly being shuffled in and out of the bank.   It's a pet peeve of mine, to be sure.   But the area control element and some tough decisions outweigh the minor complaints.

This game should be retitled Loewenherz-lite. I might have really liked this game if I hadn't already been a loyal Loewenherz fan, but this game is a step back from Loewenherz. The dualing that I love in Loewenherz is completely absent from this game. It's still mildly fun, but I'd feel cheated if I bought this game not knowing how much of a Loewenherz clone it is.

This strikes a nice balance in depth and speed of play.  Not too simple and quick, not too long and complex. I find that I don't really miss the auction mechanic of Lowenherz.  The auctions certainly add a lot with the right group of players, but there is also be something to be said for streamlining.

Interesting game. I think the card randomness hurts it a lot, though. There's some control over it, but the fact of the matter is, the really good cards just won't be sold to the market by decent players. Getting stuck without knights is a total killer.

Quite poor with 2 players. Once the game tips towards a player, they win. Also, the cards that let you steal a knight become even more game-swinging.

Game play is very smooth through the buying/selling of action cards. One of those few games that plays well with 3 or 4 players. Highly recommend this. New players have to remember though, that when they are fencing off their domaine, they are also fencing off their opponents' domaine!

I had observed and read about some of the strategic challenges to this game, but I still think it's great fun.  I even like it with two players, where more of the focus is on building rather than conquering.  
I didn't want to pitch the insert, but suffice to say that there's room for improvement on std game inserts generally.

Makes sense that the central tile has both the most valuable city, and 4 mines, to entice players to the more challenging and dangerous center and away from the edges.

This is a nailbiter from start to finish. Domaine perfectly captures the tension between wanting to execute a well-laid plan and never, never having enough resources to do it. You have to juggle multiple strategies--building domaines, expanding them (preferably into mines), protecting them with knights, forging alliances with other players, forcing enemy knights to desert their own domaines--and have enough gold to pay for all of that. Often you'll spend a turn selling a card back to the chancery, just to get enough gold to play a card the following turn that will promptly leave you broke once more.

Domaine can be deliciously brutal with players who resist turtling and go on the offensive. If you're not careful, you'll lose huge chunks of your territory to a well-timed enemy knight. And you really want to get one of each type of mine to maximize your income generation. There are four of each (bronze, silver, gold and diamond) on the board--plenty to go around for everyone, even in a 4-player game, right? Nope. Five victory points go to a person who controls three of one type of mine. Suddenly resources are scarce again. It's these kinds of little rules that keeps Domaine so cutthroat.

And, once you've ground through your resources enough enough to actually follow through on your plan (side note: it's not going to be Plan A. It won't be Plan B either. It'll most likely be Plan "what do I have enough gold for?"), you have to watch out for the endgame. If one or two players aren't paying attention, they're not going to realize that there might very well be a hefty chunk of unclaimed territory that someone can grab unopposed. After a while you'll learn to guard against that situation, but your first several games might be a bit swingy in terms of VPs.

Domaine isn't really a brain-burner, but it does require a fair amount of concentration and willingness to adapt when everything goes wonky--and it will. I think it's most fun with 4 players due to the chaos involved, but I won't ever turn down a 2- or 3-player game. This has to be one of the more underrated games on BGG, and is well worth your time.

This is a game I‘ve wanted to play it since seeing an animated ‘how to play’ after I first bought settlers. 

The game is about trying to fence in land to create a 'Domaine'. You take actions to create and expand domains, by playing different cards. These cost money to play and you earn money by selling the cards – with a bit of income from your domains. 

Quite an abstract theme – but I like it.

2017-04-17: I had heard good things about this, but this wasn't my kind of game. Too cutthroat and I just didn't see winning moves. Very spatial and the concept of people 'stealing' my territory just doesn't click with my 'having-fun'-nerve. 
It also seems to be prone to very huge swings due if you are the one being attacked by someone or if you, almost by accident, happen to not step on other peoples toes. It also ends up in positions where 'someone' has to do something to stop a sure leader, but nobody earns anything by doing it. I guess you should negotiate in some way here to stop the leader, but that is quite hard when you are constantly changing what you can haggle with (i.e. the ordercards). But mostly, it is not my kind of game where you haggle overall.
Not for my kind of brain.
Initial rating = 4 (it works but for me is highly irritating to play)

Played 1 time. I am on that bandwagon that declares Domaine to be a large improvement over Lowenhurz. Though I do like auctions, they seem to pop up in too many games, and too often in games whee they don't fit the theme well. So, gone are the auctions replaced with a very neat hand management that makes the game fly. Looks great, great theme. Nice strategy with a dose of luck to keep things a little tippy.

RATING: 8.3
I've never played Lowenherz so I don't have much to compare it to. But this is a great game.

Economics, area control/military and hand-management all rolled in one. And as a bonus, is simple to teach/learn, the board changes every time and it plays out really quickly for the itch it scratches. Only problem is we always seem to have problems keeping track of our scores and winners often seem to win by surprise.

I'm surprised this one isn't as popular as Settlers.

Rating after 1 play.

I'm not a massive fan of abstracts, and this is exactly that. With elements of Taurus (or pen and paper "cubes/boxes" even)
You will like this if you like tightly fought competitive area control games - you're crammed onto a board fighting for space, pushing boundaries with one another.

The card-based actions are fun, and the cards scale with cost as your income through the game (hopefully) increases. 

For me personally it's a bit too abstract, and not something I found especially engaging, but I wouldn't turn it down if that's what was being played (although I'd put in my vote for something different!)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This game can be extremely frustrating, especially when the player preceding you has your same strategy, as he will pick up all the cards you want; there should probably be more cards with 2 effects. [I think it would be better if the tiles were drafted or auctioned. Another game.]
The endgame mechanic (for close games where you finish the deck before someone has won) leaves me cold: it just drags on without a good reason, leaving most players helpless.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
One of my favourites and played many more times than the number of plays suggests as I didn't record plays back then.
This is quite a strategic game with a small luck element (though this is minimised by using the chancery efficiently).  I love the Mayfair packaging and pieces.

Erősen taktikai jellegű, egymás területét leválasztgatós, kártyavezérelt játék. Szerintem Teuber valami titkos családellenes összeesküvés sző a háttérben, mert minden "családi" játéka olyan szinten konfrontatív, hogy még felnőttek is simán összevesznek rajta. Ehhez képest viszont nincs bennük elég döntés, és ezt a visszásságot én nem tudom feldolgozni. Egy makker-kitolós játéknak nincs sok értelme. Node nem rossz ez a játék, csak szerintem vannak sokkal jobbak is.

Formerly my favourite game. You think people might be planning to attack you, but if you have enough resources you can almost ensure that they don't. This is one of very few games where I am always thinking and there is always tension. I enjoy that you can almost control everything, but if you want to win you need to take some risks. There's also diplomacy required where you can't always make an alliance with an opponent you honestly don't want to attack, so you need to convince them of that so you can make progress elsewhere. There's also the possibility for great moves as you dissect your opponent's domaine, or steal his mine, or block him from advancing somewhere he desperately needs to go.

I prefer Domaine over Lowenherz because there's less anguish in the acquisition of cards - I don't like auctions where I may or may not get what I want. Yes, it's just something more to think about, but it's not what I'm interested in. I'm interested in plotting what I can do on the map, not mucking about trying to get the cards to do it with.

I had this on my want list forever. Unsure if I would like it or not. Finally being able to play this I can honestly say I LOVE it. This is a great strategy and tactics game that is well balanced and plays smoothly without to much ap amongst the players.

The game components are well made and look great. This is definitely a gamers game and probably not something for the family night.

I love the random setup of the board and placement of the starting pieces for each game. This keep things differnt allowing for fresh replayability for each game. There are so many options of what to do during the game but, being limited to what you can do with the cards is where you need to start making your strategies. Card and money management are key along with when and where to build castle walls and when to try and attack your opponents. Then there is the option of expanding into their Domain to cut them off and gain points for yourself. While taking points away from them. Lots of options and ways to go about them make this a really awesome and well balanced game.

Many thanks to a very special friend who sent me her copy of the game due to it not being her kind of game. Otherwise this game could of sat on my want list forever not knowing if I would like it. How sweet is that? :) I wish I had more friends like her with such a kind, generous and warm heart. Thanks again special friend. Your the BEST!!! :)

This game is exactly what I wanted when I originally bought Lowenherz.  I'm not a big fan of auctions, and both groups I played Lowenherz with seriously hated the potential of not winning an action multiple times in a row.

Domaine is still tense and viscious, but it seems less hostile, if that makes any sense.  The components and overall look are greatly improved, and the scoring is [i]much[/i] simpler while still providing different types of terrain to capture.

There's really nothing new there. Being from 2003 I didn't expect there to be. But what's there it does really well. Has a good mix of tactics and strategy. Buy a knight or risk it and expand your domaine instead. Go for some quick VP's or expand for a few turns to get another mine. Steal a knight or make peace treaty. Good screw your neighbor game too. 
I was surprised just how many times throughout the game I needed just one more coin to make a move. Or how big of an effect a border could have by being moved just one space. 
Easy to teach and can play in 45mins to an hour.

Acquired in UK Maths Trade February 2015.

This is hands down the meanest game I've ever enjoyed. The player who will win is often the player with the most cunning and the least scruples. Do not play this with anyone who will get upset and give up if someone plays a move that steals loads of points from them and trashes their strategy even though they're in last place already.

With two players, it's extremely unforgiving. One mistake can doom you. Better with more players, but [i]even meaner[/i].

Domaine's card play system streamlines Lowenherz and removes the most frustrating aspects of its predecessor. The haggling of Lowenherz caused the game to drag, whereas Domaine's simpler method keeps the pace quick and tightens the focus on the board play. Unfortunately, this tighter focus also reveals the game system's major flaw: the board play just isn't very interesting!  Yes, the haggling of Lowenherz was annoying.  But without it, the game just feels like a bush league version of more interesting territory games.

Good update of Lowenherz. Easier to explain and to play.  There might be an imbalance built into the game which allows players to play a card, retrieve the same card, and play it again on the next turn.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Based on one play with 4 players.  The game seems to reward people who close off their own domains fast and use later wall cards to screw with others while slowly expanding into other people's territories.  Aside from initial placement, the game doesn't seem very strategic, but more tactical.  No planning can really occur because everything is based on what the other players do and what cards you happen to have in your hand.  Because of your extremely limited choices, it seems like the game almost plays itself.  Also, a lot of it seems too luck oriented because of the card draw.  Luck is supposed to make decisions more interesting, not limit your decisions. I didn't really care for it, the theme was too tacked on for me, plus the game itself offered very little real tough decisions.  

This game would be a solid 6 or 7, sort of boring but a well put together game, except for the end game problem.  

In our game, the right side of the board was slightly ignored early in the game, then suddenly we realized you could place about three walls and have a huge domain, boxed in by the many other kingdoms on the left.  This gave someone (me, hahaha) who hadn't planned for it or done anything to deserve it, a huge points score, almost enough to win the game on the play.  Ironically, because the deck of cards was already exhausted at that point, I couldn't do anything to get the 2 more points needed to win.  This is a huge flaw in the game and the game only functions if everyone is aware of it and watches out for it.  This makes it tough to play with newbies.  The whole thing is almost broken because of this in my opinion.  Then again, I only played it once! 

During the game, one of the other players convinced me I would like Lowerherz better.

Although Domaine is "just" a reworking of Lowenherz, the feel of them is quite different and Domaine is easier on the family or occasional gamer: for this reason, it sees the light of the day much more often.

RATING: 9
I thought this might be one I'd like. First impression is pretty good but this thing is just brutal! The board is so crowded, and money is so tight that the intensity on this one is through the roof. Domaine is very original, the closest thing I can compare it to would be something like Go or Through the Desert where you are trying to wall off big pieces of territory for yourself. The big wrinkle here is that what you can do is determined by action cards, and you have to pay high prices just to use them. The spacial board play is the meat of the game, but the card play really turns the screws against the player. If you enjoy games where you always have that feeling of needing to do more on your turn than you can accomplish, this game has that in spades. And it's short. Definitely want to play this more.

I probably shouldn't admit this on the internet, but my first game ended with me having a score of one point. I had several grand long-term plans in the works, but the game ended before any of them could come to fruition. The good news is, I can only improve!

====
This is a more-the-merrier type game... you want that board to be crowed for maximum player interaction. I'd recommend against playing with two, and the jury's still out on three.

====
Ten games in, this has only grown in my esteem. Incredible depth without unnecessary complexity.

国境は皆のものなので、自分の国を囲っていたらいつのまにか相手の国を囲う手伝いをしているという事態も起こる。点数のバランスが絶妙で規定の勝利点の直前で失速するようになっており、自ずと接戦となる。軍事力、領土、資金力のバランスをゲームの流れをつかみながらプレイしていくというのは最近の流行でもあるが、このゲームの時点でシンプルに完成されている。ゲームが終わった後の充実感も申し分ない。

RATING: 6
I thought the game was a little rigid, in that once the player positions were chosen, I felt I knew who was going to win.  Maybe it was self fulfilling prophecy.  Given that everyone was new to the game except the eventual winner, I felt there were a couple of surprises in store for the new players, like the last castle takes what's left of the board, and how if left by yourself, you expand without problem.

I'm going to try it one more time and evaluate then, but currently, I thought the end of the game (the last castle scoring 30 points or so) was very unsatisfying.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A milder version of Lowenherz with the direct confrontation for actions taken out. The central mechanisms are the same so it's really just a variant. It's playable in an hour, so less risk of worn out welcome, but the card draw throws in just a tiny amount of luck.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I find the game mechanic to be a little dry for my tastes.  Don't enjoy the "feature" that allows the last player to form a domaine very easily due to having all it's walls previously formed by other domaine's.  The arm's race also gets a little tedious after awhile.

RATING: 7.2
A light, enjoyable, quick, gateway type game.  The production value is not bad with plastic mounted knights and castles.  The board gets assembled differently each play--just like Settlers of Catan--which dramatically boosts Domaine's replay value.  Domain is a card driven area control game with elegant mechanics.  On each player's turn an action card is executed after paying its cost in cash or a card is sold to a communal offer area to raise cash.  Players are competing to carve out territories on the game board which are then expanded, often at other players' expense.  There is something extra appealing about the composition of the game design in its light, yet well designed gameplay.  The design of Domaine does what it sets out to do quite well.  The game length feels Goldilocks just-right.

Comparison to First Edition called "Löwenherz":
++ Components: Original are just fine but these look great.

- Luck of the draw
- Despite that still no family game
- Missing the interaction, bluff and deduction parts of Löwenherz.

Funny enough ... it is similar to how Descent 1st came to be Descent 2nd (without stealing the name). Minor improvements, faster to explain (less rules) but not a better game but worse. Sadly. I really wanted to like it.

RATING: 7
== Played 3 times (each 4-player)

An interesting area control game, with a decent amount of hand management as well.  Getting others to do your work for you, without them trampling you in the process seems to be a key to winning.

Much like Go, control of the corners is critical, followed by the sides, then the middle.  Controlling a "wing" (corner + adjacent side) is huge, and should be blocked or sliced up by opponents.

The middle can provide a late game point boost, but is tough to finish at just the right time.

Medieval'ish territorial expansion. My impressions after my first game is that this is a fun and interesting game. For a German game, it is quite confrontational, with plenty of opportunity for whacking the leader - or whomever you might feel like hitting.

As always, my rating reflects my initial feeling that this is a "nice" game; further experience will likely push the rating either up or down...

This is a good game, and even with teaching the rules it'll finish in about an hour. I really like how the prices to play cards change as the game moves on, so you're looking for a bargain in the pile of 'sold' cards.

Initial Rating: 6.5 (January 2013)

I really liked this game, with further plays (I believe) it can go higher in my ratings. For me, it is a superior game than Teuber´s Settlers of Catan.

Domaine is a game of simple rules, but the gameplay has a satisfying depth, also it plays very quickly so the total game time (and the downtime) is pretty low. You can play it, with 4 players, under 1 hour. 

At the beginning you try to expand your domain, but from midgame onward the game becomes very cutthroat, it is a struggle to prevail making it very fun and tense. It has more randomness that I usually enjoy, but as you can buy cards AND it plays so quickly, I don’t really mind.

The components are beautiful, and the board looks great when all the players have developed their domains.

I understand this is a watered down version of Löwenherz, I still would like to give it a try to see how the changes affect the game, also I really like a bidding game and from what I understand, Löwenherz is much more strategic.

Domaine is a good abstract game, I’m rating it a 6.5 for now, as it is a game I’m usually willing to play, but have no real desire to do it (weird). There is always another game I would rather play, but when I do play Domaine, I have fun. 

Current Rating: 6.0

Lowenhertz lite.  Surprisingly, even though the changes with the action cards eliminate one of the best aspects of its predecessor, the resulting game is very good.  It is quite different, being both shorter and less intense.  It makes this game quite accessible to less . . . involved game players.  And the new bits are really cool!

RATING: 8
A much needed improvement of the original Loewenherz.  The clunky auctions are gone and the board size has been reduced.  The rules have been cleaned up and the game play is streamlined.

Tense finishes are now common  and the majority leader problem of the first edition is gone.

A superior 2nd edition...

RATING: 7
A more accessible multiplayer Go with a pleasant layer of theme.

Each player begins the game by placing four castles on the board. Ultimately, the goal is to build walls and claim as much territory as possible for your Domaine. Conflict is direct, but never capricious or without warning. Knights can be used to wrestle territory away from your opponents, walls can be placed to greatly inconvenience them, and occasionally a truce can be forced upon a menacing neighbor. Some spaces are worth more points than others (forests, villages), and some spaces generate much-needed income (mines). Players manage a hand of three cards (available actions), all of which require cash to execute. Cards can also be returned to the display to raise cash, making them available for the opposition to draw on their turns. Players must take care to deny cards to their opponents based on the unfolding struggle on the board, and this type of interaction mirrors that seen in both London and PG: Dev Kit. What are the odds that I would play three games with this mechanic in the same month?

A rock solid game with few competitors - much lighter than Go, and for my tastes superior to Through the Desert.

RATING: 9
Of the Klaus Teuber designed games I've played (Catan [Settlers, Seafarers, Cities & Knights]), DOMAINE is, by far, my favorite.  It's best designed for a 2-player game (whereas, Catan needs at least 3), making the players focus on the placement of their castles & the building/expansions of their boarders in order to score the optimum amount of VPs.  My wife loves this game--more than Catan which was her favorite--& it has made her far more open to playing other board games.  Mr. Teuber designs the best "gateway" games to entice non-boardgamers into our world & DOMAINE fits the bill nicely.  Even I love this game as much as my wife & I know we'll be playing a lot more of it in the nights to come.

It looks like this would play more quickly than Lowenherz, which is a plus.  I still would like to give Lowenherz a try just to compare though.

There's nothing offensive about Domaine - I like the streamlined and relatively quick play.  I think that I'm just not predisposed to enjoy games where smacking down your opponent so blatantly is such an important part of the play.  I'm all for aggression or backstabbing, but it is done in such a direct way that I don't see this becoming a favorite.  But I'd definitely play this again.

FLGS Fire Sale--smoke damaged box--this is a beautiful and elegant game design from Klaus Teuber, the designer of Settlers.  I actually played this one before Settlers.

Teuber's best game by far.
Lowenherz needs both strategic and tactical thinking and it's all about player interaction and suprising moves. Also looks good and plays fast. 
Would be a perfect 10, but sometimes luck of the draw can mess your game up.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Language independent. Does not take too much space, not too long, good game.
Nice for a couple dozen times. Much replayability because the board is created dynamically. Cards evolve over time. Does not take too long. You can plan while holding cards for next turn, so while there is downtime, you will not be bored. Some spectacular things may happen - armament race, coalitions, sudden ending of game... You feel you are building something. 

However it does not give that "one more game!" feeling afterwards. Truth be told, it's now May 2017 and I haven't played the game in the last 10 years, as it was buried underneath other games. I plan to play it soon.

Strange that the bgg main title is called domaine, where the original was lowenherz, meaning lionheart. I guess that title was already taken.

Mostly just a pretty game, but the ever changing boundaries is a great concept--although for that factor alone it would be better to play Tigris and Euphrates. The card play is original too with an option for discarding that allows for other players to potentially get your good/bad cards. My major complaint is that the little black tokens representing the barriers are too easy to scoot around (nobody sneeze!) and are sometimes difficult to see (would white have been a better color choice?).

Bought at Gen Con Indy 2006, without testing because it was highly rated and I had a 50% off coupon for Mayfair.

I didn't like (a lot) Klaus Teuber's 'Settlers of Catan' or 'Neuen Entdecker' but Domaine is a little gem. A good mix of hard decisions, tactics + card luck = just fantastic. A very brilliant game with smooth gameplay. Gamers game, definitely. Just like in 'Settlers of Catan', it takes few games before you know what to do and how to do it. Domaine could be even better, but because (A) good start is crucial... AND (B) you need expansion-cards... IF you want to win - the game is just great, not an excellent.

Teuber at his most strategic, still with a strong theme and a great design.

RATING: 7.5
[2006.Dec.11] A Klaus Teuber game with more "bite" than I originally expected it to have. Quite surprising actually. Definitely need to revisit this game...

[2007.Jan.11] Having played this again, I am comfortable with my current rating. The game plays exceptionally well with 4-players. It requires just enough thinking--read: make tough decisions--to make the game heavier than I originally expected, but this is a good thing. The rules themselves are quite easy: (a) collect income (if any), (b) use a card (play it or sell it), and (c) draw back to hand-size (of 3 cards). So now that you know how, go out and build your own domain. You'll be glad you did.

Expand your domaine in order to produce more income and victory points.  Early conflict may be a bad choice at least in a 3 player game?  Either sell a card for money OR pay to play a card in which you can do one of the following:  1) play knight(s), 2) expand borders by two spaces, 3) build wall(s), 4) recruit a traitor knight, 5) force an eternal peace between two domains.

It's really important to master the art of using Expansion to complete your other domaine.

Significantly different with more than two players--board changes quickly and long-term plans get much harder to implement.  Jockeying for space and cutting each other off feels a little too much like screwage to me, so it'll never be a particular favorite of mine, but it plays just fine for what it is.  Components are all well made.

Not sure what to think.  It seem like it ought to be interesting game of drafting and playing cards.  The amount of beating on your neighbors (and the incentive to bash a falling behind player) is maybe too great, given that your overall control is not particularily high.  Also, I'm pretty sure if you fall behind, you are done for.  I need to play more to know if my raiting will go up or down.

recommended by those who like Knizia's Rheinlander.  Has a puzzle-like aspect.  The action cards work really well, and the ability to sell them back is clever.  The alliance card is a powerful defense.

RATING: 4
1 Play, 4 Players. Surprisingly, this game fell flat for me, and I thought it was going to be my type of game. I think the board is too in flux from round to round for me to really enjoy it. The game is supposed to offer strategy,  but instead it comes off feeling like guesswork. You constantly need to guess if you think your opponent is going to come after you or not.  If you guess incorrectly, you will either waste valuable turns fortifying or risk getting run over.  Throughout the game I was always second guessing my choices due to the constant flux of the board. Overall, I liked the concept, but the fun factor was definitely missing.

Update: Played again after four years, and while the game works, I´m not sure it´s a keeper. We saw the leader drop to last place in the final rounds, and while it gave me the victory it raises concerns about leader-bashing and kingmaking.

There is a lot to like in this game, but it is a connecting game to some degree and thus suffers the usual drawback in that category: Whether I win or lose I feel it depends a little too much on the play of the opponents. If someone blocked me rather than somebody else, I may lose because of that.

I want to like this game more than I do right now.  I believe it has a lot of potential.  However, it went right over the heads of my friends.  I think that there's not nearly enough action cards in the deck and that the game ends way too quickly.  A good chunk of the board didn't have any walls created near it by the time we reached the end of the deck.  Something's not right about that.

My rating could certainly go up a chunk w/more plays.

My feeling is that it may be best with 4.

04/23/11 Played a three-player game. Overall the production values are high. Yet I thought the walls looked terrible. As a lover of its predecessor Löwenherz I felt they'd removed the nasty heart of the game. Domaine may be more family friendly, but not everyone wants that. So, to me its OK, but it pails in comparison to its forefather Löwenherz. Still, Domaine is worth playing now and then.

What a surprise!  Played this game without ever having heard of it last night, after I told the game night host that I have a special affinity for games wherein a single move or event can suddenly change everything.  He immediately thought of this, we played a 4p game, and I liked it.  Sure enough, I made one move which netted me 26 points, which by itself accounted for 5/6ths of the points needed to win the game (we were playing to 30 since it was a 4p game).  Everybody playing was a newb, and I don't expect that experienced players would ever let me do that, but still the possibility of big, sweeping, game changing moves lends enormous tension to this game.  

Beyond that, the mechanics of the game is sort of dots and boxes meets Go, but the feel of the game is totally different.  Very confrontational, juicy, clearly requires negotiation.  I only give it a 6 because I don't give high ratings to games I haven't played a million times.  This will probably go way up if I get to play it more.

I thought I might be disappointed with this having read how Löwenherz is a more of a gamer's game with it's bidding system.  I found Domaine to feel much more stream-lined than it's older brother.  The drafting system really helps with the pace of the game.  Overall it's a great system of enclosure and still retains most of it's nastiness.

Played this a lot as Lowenherz back when it was an intergame game.  It was the last game of the tournament, our team's victory rested on my result, and our game lasted maybe two hours.  We negotiated down to the last coin; we fought over every square.  We gave the leader an enormous territory, then split it up into small pieces... haven't played since, because no other game could compete.

(I won, by the way.)

Полуабстрактный середнячок.

Игра построена на механизме огораживания территорий: кто больше отгородит, тот и выиграл. Конечно, игра не настолько банальна - на этот базовый механизм наворочено ещё куча всего: карточный движок, разная ценность клеток, расширение и захват.

Вначале, игра кажется медленной и скучноватой, но после нескольких партий начинает течь легко, сохраняя при этом глубину.

Okay game, but feels pretty old at this point. For being a game that's almost entirely card-driven, it feels awkwardly restrictive to put some actions as more or less powerful on different cards. Plus, and I may have missed something, but dukats and knights seem almost tacked on to the rest of the design. Decent, but nothing memorable.

Rates 6-7 as a 2 player game and rates an 8 as a 3 player game. Haven't played a 4 player game yet but suspect it would be a 9. Intensity and cutthroat play builds steadily as the game approaches the final stages. Plays quickly and is quite simple yet has a good amount of turn angst every round.

Another Klaus Teuber game, another runaway loser problem.  Lack of barrier cards in the early stages of the game will put you in the hole, and the ever-increasing cost of playing action cards will make the hole deeper.  Whereas the straggler in Settlers of Catan becomes little more than an observer, the straggler in this game becomes a punching bag for the richer, luckier players.

I like the mechanics here and it is best with 4 players, good with 3 and waste of time with just 2. Even though you lose a bit control with more there will be more action all over board and that is making it more interesting. Setup in the beginning is crucially important and you cannot do much if you screw it up in the beginning. Not a very beginner-friendly game in that sense unless you give a new player some hints to avoid biggest mistakes.

A sleek, streamlined version of Lowenherz - does away with the auctions and some other fiddlyness and replaces it with a more tactical, and much quicker game.  Domaine also has the bonus of being playable with 2.  Not the deep thinker that Lowenherz is, but a game that is much more likely to get played because of its shorter duration.

Very nice game. I have only played with 4 players ... get that income up to 3 as soon as possible and keep it there. Later &quot;phase&quot; cards (phase C and D cards) can be important, but being able to establish 2 Domaines early will be crucial later in the game. The 2 player rules included with the game look interesting and I look forward to trying a 2 player game.

Take Lowenherz, strip out all the slow stuff (the bidding duels), make knights a bit less powerful by putting in an uber-alliance card, and bingo, you’ve got a sped up, more balanced game. It’s still a multi-player territory carve out game though which relies on everyone doing their bit to keep leaders in check regardless of the fact that it’s easier to pick on weaker players, so this isn’t my favourite genre. I won’t be picking it up (already have Lowenherz), but would happily play if someone else brought it along.

One only point I consider negative (for which I didn't give a 9). The game ends as soon as you finish setting up the board, there's no second part in which domains fight together. This is probably being studied not to make it too long and slow, indeed. Anyway, a good variation could be to continue the game after the normal game ending. The game becomes longer but still very enjoyable.
Update - I decreased the rating, because in many years I got no desire of playing it anymore. There must be some reason for this...

One of my favorites, Domaine is a rock-solid game of territorial acquisition.  Gameplay decisions are limited but allow for good strategy, always leaving you wanting to do more than you can on a turn.  Fantastic components round out a great gaming experience.

Interesting abstract.  40 years ago I played a game called "Camelot" -- this is a more sophisticated version of taking an expanded checkers board with terrain features and trying to carve out and expand a region and boundaries.  I'm not a fan of abstracts so that costs my rating a couple points, but it could be a very playable game.  I'll give it a few more tries, although I may have to talk my friends who also don't like abstracts, into playing.

Excellent area control game with lots of tough choices. Cards can be used for expanding your empire or gaining the wealth you desperately need. However, when you trade cards in for money, your opponents can pick them up. A good mix of fun and thought... I would definitely play this one again.

用城牆圍疆域得分的遊戲，靠卡牌驅動行動，但用卡要花錢，錢要靠棄牌或占礦區來取得，就算把地圍好也可能因為武力輸被敵人被瓜分切割掉分數，武士還可能背叛投敵，也有同盟救命牌，環環相扣步步關鍵的好遊戲，美術放到現在也算優異，用料紮實，模型雖然細緻度不能和現在比但也很有視覺效果了，十分推薦，評分保守一點只給7.5是因為這遊戲過程可能蠻兇殘的......若玩家被打爆蠶食鯨吞的體驗可能不是那麼美

*** Traded for Targi ***

$0 - Picked this up from a local board gamer's give away.

Goal Met :star::star::star::star::star: $1 or less per play

It's a solid "German game" with victory points and player "confrontation" from the designer of Settlers of Catan. People fight over land in this area control game which feels scripted with the card deck but randomness comes from the setup. This is really an abstract at heart which gives me a Through the Desert mixed with Go feel. It is definitely not a spouse friendly game if you are not in a relationship that's ok with killing each other at the throat.

---- Update ----
Clearly a good game but too confrontational to my fiancee's liking. I asked her if I should trade it and she said yes right away.

RATING: 8
This game had some nice surprises to it.  There is a lot of strategy and it moved really quickly.  Conflict is quick and simple.  Haven't played Lowenherz, so I can't compare, but I think this one is better considering my group of semi-gamer, no-thinknuts.  After some more plays, possibilities and strategies become more multi-faceted, as each person begins to learn how to manipulate the system.  I like it a lot, and a player always seems to be in it, as the group can usually catch the leader.

RATING: 5
A game about expanding the borders of empires. Not bad, but the design is starting to show it's age. One issue is that eventually one they'll be one remainder area that a player will naturally grab; this tends to be a big area worth lots of points. This makes the game feel a bit gamey (but there are other things which make it feel gamey too). Not bad, but not great either. A bit underpolished?

I really like this game a lot more than everyone in my group.  But they have the Settlers bug, so it may lose some glory in their eyes.  The board can close in on you dangerously quickly, espeically if your next domain neighbor has a bunch of knights and expand cards.  Another one where you need to be kind to beginners or they won't play with you again.

The first play was kinda slow moving, but I suspect that was due in part to the fact that it was the first time playing it.  The second time it was quite cutthroat, something I enjoy in a game, so it boosted my rating of the game.  Only been played as a two player game.

I'm finding that it is necessary to enclose mines rather than large point scoring areas, as income is so important, otherwise your chances of doing well are diminished; without hope of making progress in a game of this length does not make a rewarding session. I find the gameplay tactical interesting (but unforgiving when mistakes are made), far better streamlined then Lowenherz (by removing the longwinded negotiation, and the sitting out your turn when squeezed out of getting an action). Whereas the predecessor was really a 4 player, Domaine is really a 2 player. With more than 2, if in a weak domain, chances are you'll be a logical target to be weakened further. Also your chances of getting an essential card are diminished. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
-

A tense and engaging game that makes you feel you are in a race the whole time.  Domaine is fundamentally a zero-sum game and the primary means of growing your territories (domains) is through direct and blunt aggression in order to take some from the opponents. For this reason, the game can become very mean and personal.

Perhaps not for the faint of heart or the overly vindictive who would rather pursue extreme and persistent retaliatory plays even if those plays may be clearly illogical and to their own detriment. Except for this aspect of the game, it is one of my favorites.

J'aime ce jeu. La mécanique est simple et élégante, mais les choix sont complexes. A chaque tour, il faut payer pour jouer une carte action, ou en revendre une, puis piocher une carte face cachée ou prendre une carte face visible parmi celles vendues précédemment (sauf celle qu'on vient de vendre). Les cartes permettent de former ou d'agrandir un territoire, de modifier le rapport de force avec un territoire ennemi, ou d'imposer un traité de non agression entre deux territoires. On ne peut pas gagner à ce jeu en se focalisant uniquement sur les aspects tactiques. Le jeu se gagne sur les choix stratégiques et diplomatiques.

2 Play

Completely new to this game. First play seemed too short as the cards quickly ran out long before any significant wall building had occurred. Only one corner actually had domaines established. Need to hold back much further on the Knight play in favor of establishing domaines around mines and then expanding their area to squeeze out opponents. Definately play again.

On second play, avoided the urge to play nights and faired much better. The cards still run out astonishingly quickly but we stressed that at the beginning and when the discard pile was as tall as the new card pile. The last three rounds when the new card pile is exhausted offered some nice and tough decisions to deny domaines to others while maximizing your own possibilities - a nice close game right to the end.

After buying it, I set up a practice game by myself, then stared at the board for twenty minutes without seeing one single good strategy to try, and put the game away.  I finally got a chance to play it (2-player), and it turned out to be quite a challenging and fun game, in my opinion, much deeper than it appeared.  It's a cutthroat competition game, like chess, in which you try to stomp your competition by doing outright harm to them, not just do better at something than they do, so it might not suit everyone's preferences.  Also, there's a lot of chance to it, and I didn't like the economic system at all, so there's room for improvement in this game.  All that said, I like it and I'll play it again (especially with more players) when I next get a chance.

Component Quality:
Very good. The plastic minis are tough and the board is a decent thickness. I like when a game goes with interesting player colors, even if it means I don't get to play my classic yellow.

Gameplay:
Didn't expect to enjoy this as much as I did. Just the right amount of confrontation between players. Didn't mind having the 3rd uncontrolled player in the middle of things while playing with only two players, but the game really shines with three or more. Everything seemed very balanced and tight. The final rounds are always very hectic has players fight over those last few points.

I owned and played Lowenherz before trying out this game and I like what they've done with the mechanics.  It is far easier to get a grasp of what is going on in Domaine than the original.  But I liked the tension and additional thought that Lowenherz required.  I'll play Domaine if that is what is at hand, but I'd pick Lowenherz over it.

I love this kind of game, and Domaine has a lot going for it.  It's nasty, tense, and full of interesting choices.  The rich-get-richer money mechanic at first seemed too strong to overcome -- in our first game, there was a runaway leader who could not be stopped.  But if all players know the importance of income, it's hard for any single player to pull away.  I've played both Lowenherz and Domaine, and refuse to take sides in the holy war.  They're both fine games.

Ok.  I have a lot of games.  And people are always asking me "What's your favorite?".  I don't really have one, but Domaine is surprisingly enough working its way up to the the top for me.  It's relatively easy to teach.  The game moves along quickly.  Each game plays somewhat differently.  And there is always tension.

[5 plays] Domaine is the reimplemented version aimed at broader appeal. Löwenherz is the gamer's game. Domaine is still a good game, but doesn't have the richness of decisions and the epic power swings bidding for money and movement.

Most recent play with Michael, Corey, and Garrett at Game Camp 2010.

RATING: 7
Players place castles and knights on the board and use a variety of action cards and money to build tombstone-like fences, creating DOMAINES which score points. Yes, it's area control (literally).

The variable board allows for different games and there are a variety of strategies one can employ: knights, mines, etc. The use of the chancery to manage money and card flow is smart and the game plays fairly quick for something with a E&T-like method of expansion of terrain.

Vicious, quick playing (players either play a card or sell a card each turn), fun.

To my mind, Domaine represents the perfection of a certain (very ubiquitous) sort of designer game: that game in which one must focus on developing a financial base early in order to exercise the military and political options later which will assure victory. In this way, Domaine is like Puerto Rico - one needs to figure out a way to make some money to enable to key construction. Money must come first. In Domaine, this means getting a mine or two in a small domaine along the edge of the board or in a corner. If a player can achieve this, then she will be a contender. I enjoy Domaine more than Puerto Rico though. I like the direct conflict, the organic feel of expanding and contracting domaines, and the transparency of planning. What do I mean by "transparency of planning"? I mean that, if you examine your situation closely, you needn't *guess* about what you need to do to win! You can see some clear options, some riskier than others, some offensive to particular players and not others, and some cheaper than others. Several successful "routes" to victory seem to fall out of the game design into your lap, and then YOU get to decide what you should do. This makes Domaine rather exciting! Puerto Rico also has this element, in that you can go for a "corn strategy" or a "factory strategy" or whatever. I like Domaine more, though.

Domaine also reminds me of Tigris and Euphrates, in that the focus of play is these little kingdoms which can be broken up, expanded, and diminished. Contrasting T&E though, Domaine's game play is a bit more intuitive and straightforward.

Every turn in Domaine, you can either play a card or sell a card. How is that for parsimony? It costs to play a card, and though you begin with some money, you'll soon be required to "waste" a turn selling a card. This highlights why early mine ownership is so vital. Mines provide you with money every turn, reducing the number of turns you must spend selling cards. By getting to play more cards than other players, you've just secured a nice advantage for yourself. You may not lead in early scoring, but that doesn't matter. Focus on generating your economy first! Wealth combined with careful choice of cards from the Chancery are crucial to success - although I don't mean to diminish good card play at their expense! The cards allow you to do things like: build walls to create domaines, add knights to the board, cause enemy knights to desert their lords to join YOU, force alliances between two neighboring domaines, and expand your domaine directly by bumping out its borders.

A final caveat, though, to the wondering buyer of this out of print game (why isn't this in print? it's great!) is that the level of conflict is very high. (I *like* this in a game, but many people do not. Know thyself.) Options abound to screw other players over pretty severely, and you may *have* to in order to win. This is the ultimate crap on your neighbor game, because it's very likely you will defecate upon them all before the game is concluded. Pardon my scatological metaphor, but I'm a metaphorical thinker, and I'm sticking to this one (no pun intended). As a special treat, in my first game, another player rendered one of my domaines stillborn by leaving me no room to add a knight and no room to expand into neutral territory - and the comment was made that my domaine had been "pinched off".

Enjoy!

With 3 players a really interesting game, where good play can lead to big gains.

With four players not as good - less turns increases the luck factor,  and with only three castles each it's very easy for one player to find themselves completely screwed mid-game. And it's too hard to make really neat moves for big domaines with three opponents.

Igazi konfrontatív játék a Catan szerzőjétől. A játékosok egy mezővel, erdővel, településekkel és bányákkal jelzett táblán próbálnak minél több területet megszerezni. A 4 különböző bánya fajtánként ad körönként pénzt, de azonosanként győzelmi pontot. A település és erdő győzelmi pontokat hoznak, a mezőn pedig ingyen tudnak a lovagok terjeszkedni. Rajtuk kívül határoló jelzőkkel vesznek körbe a játékosok minél nagyobb területet. A konfliktus a körbekerítésen túl a kerítések növelésével és lovagok elvételével indul meg igazán a játék középső részén. Jól kitalált az építkezős, majd egymást minél jobban kiszorítós részek változása a játékban. Szerencse csak a lapok húzásakor jelenik meg a játékban, ettől nem kell tartani. Lapok kijátszása pénzbe kerül, amit a bányákon kívül a lapok eladásával is lehet szerezni. Tetszett az azonnali pontozás, így mindig pontosan nyomon követhető ki hogyan áll a játékban. A magyarul is megjelent szépen kivitelezett Oroszlánszív nem rossz játék, sőt, de nem igazán az én stílusom. 7 pontot érdemelne objektíven, de én az ilyen közvetlen konfliktusos játékokat nem igazán kedvelem. Akik azonban az ilyeneket kedvelik, mindenképpen próbálják ki!

Domain is a pretty tough game to comment on. Main reasons are, while its VERY interesting I wouldnt call it "fun".

CONS: not much interaction, the number of players makes a big difference in different ways not so much good or bad, but changes the experience, for it to be "fun" you need to actively approach it as a conflict game- its possible not to be conflict orientated depending on numbers of players. Some down time between plays while opponents are working on strategy. Crampy board, but as you will find out - its needed to make the conflict thing work, though one must wonder if maybe everything couldnt have been upsized just a little??

PROS: It still is a top game, if conflict focused its fun, 3 + players makes it chaotic but in a good way. Nice Idea, nice board visuals and components.

Great abstract placement game that has enough flavor to help you forget that it is abstract.  Lots of tough decisions, cool income management system, great player interaction.  Certainly can devolve into a kingmaker situation, but it doesn't bother me so much as it is so much fun to play.  (Plus in most games with a kingmaker problem, the player that played nicest with the loser usuallly comes out ahead, so the winning of a game is generally reflective of overall gameplay).  I have a feeling that this rating will go up with more plays.

A very different game from the original, though the mechanics of creating and expanding domains are unchanged. A much cleaner design without the bidding and with just one kind of cash, and it certainly moves along faster -- it can easily be completed in an hour. I&#039;m undecided on whether it&#039;s a good thing that your available actions now depend largely on the luck of the draw; the incorporation of the political cards into the main deck takes away an element of choice that was a big part of Lowenherz. And if you don&#039;t get many wall cards in the early going, you can fall way behind.

This game is way better than the game the designer is best known for: Settlers. In this game players vie for control to build the biggest kingdoms. It's an area control game, where players build borders in their favour and protect their lands with knights. When you're stronger than your neighbour you can steal his land. But, these knights can be bribed and a truce can be made between two neighbouring lands, rendering your knights worthless.
The game also features a nice hand management mechanic. Cards can be played to perform actions, but they'll have to be paid for and money is tight. Therefore cards can also be sold, as a way to get more money. Players have to be careful which cards they sell, because it might be a card one of your opponents is waiting for. Turns are really simple: play/sell a card and draw a new card, either from the deck or from the pool of sold cards. Victory points are given for the lands players control and scores will go back-and-forth as players are stealing each others land.
Great game with direct conflict and a euro-game feel.

A gift from Jasper.

Had I never played Lowenhertz, I would have considered this a quality game: it's pretty fast, it's got some interesting area control mechanics and the money management leads to some interesting timing decisions.  However, having played Lowenhertz, I find that this game lacks its tension and direct conflict (via the duels) and is therefore uninspiring despite the chrome.

I don't like many abstract games and this is certainly purely an abstract game.  However, it offers enough to do and think about that it becomes quite a fun and engaging experience.

In this game players take turns either playing a card (which costs money) or selling a card for money.  Each card does something different but the main goal of the game is to build borders around your castles until they are completely enclosed and score based on the spaces inside your domain.

Money is super tight in this game so the first few turns you alternate between selling and playing cards until you take control of a few mines and then you can start to play two cards in between each sell or better.  Towards the end of the game cards also become more expensive so you will never really have enough money coming in to be able to play one every turn.

I really like the decisions this game presents players.  Each border placed is also likely a free border for your neighbors as well so there is a constant tug of war between helping yourself and helping your opponents.  There is a lot of interaction in this game as well even after a domain is created with the ability to expand into their territory essentially stealing points from them.

I have an older version of the game which isn't the prettiest but it isn't ugly either.  This also has a custom insert which holds all the pieces neatly.

I got the German version of this in a Math trade a while ago, and it has been sitting on the shelf for a while now, so when I got a chance to play Mayfair’s giant version at Gencon this year I jumped at it.  It is a nifty area control game that seems to play well with four (but not so much with three).  I like the action cards but poor draws can really be a drag.  The fence laying mechanism works well, but it can lead to situations where someone encloses a huge Domaine causing a n endgame situation much more quickly than expected.  That affect will probably go away with more experienced players.

Overall a good game athat probably gets less credit thna it deserves.

Trimmed down version of the old favourite Löwenherz. I prefer Löwenherz because of the bidding element for cards. But Domaine really has the upper hand when it comes to scalability (Löwenherz is only really good with 4) and simplicity: I could try this with casual gamers, which is out of the question with Löwenherz.

So the question arises: do I need both?

I wish we knew whether the rules really mean what they say about expanding a domaine.  Does the second square expanded to really have to continue out in a straight line from the first one?  Apparently some of the company's demo people weren't teaching the game that way, even though it seems to be clearly stated in the rules.  Nice card accumulation system, anyway, to replace the bidding war from Löwenherz.

Wow!  I put off playing this for years because I was expecting it to be more of a war game.  It's a little on the long side, but that may just have been the inexperience of the players involved--the person teaching it to us didn't play, and none of the players had ever played before.  The mechanics are well thought out except for the tie-breaker.  We had a situation where one player got five VPs for having the most money, which tied him with the leader.  Since the tie-breaker was Most Money, this automatically gave him the win.  It seems unfair that most money should count twice for the score like that.  One player suggested that the tie-breaker should be whoever has the most non-scoring territory within their domain(s), which seems a bit more reasonable to me.

So far really enjoying this game.  It hits all the right spots for me.  Simple, tactical and thinky.  There are a couple ways to mitigate luck of the draw.  I'm a little suspect of the draw of the cards but, as always, more plays will clue me in to the deck layout (which is small) and improve piece movement.  Our first play revealed we are not seeing the whole board.  More opportunities for domain growth next time. A CDA.  Card Driven Abstract. :)

update : Knowing the deck, knowing the rules has just made this game nice and evil.  Very fun with a lot to look out for.  I'm bad at keeping track of everything the other players are doing which ultimately makes me lose most of the time.

Domaine is one of those odd games where you can all play perfectly nicely and score your own little regions, but the game shines when people are vicious and mean to each other. In our game, one player got squeezed out completely and had one solitary point until very late on in the game. There's some luck of the draw, but this felt fairly mitigated by being able to hold on to cards that might be more useful later on.

In our play, the most aggressive player was second by 1 point, the most passive/defensive actually won by a point and the early leader who was mildly aggressive and then built out on his own was third, again by a point. That bodes pretty well for the game longer term.

Magnificent game, one of the best of medium-light games. Only downside is that with two players there's plenty of income which is think will change when there's more. Edit: Got to play this with four players and yes, it was more vicious and money was extremely tight. Only minus point was that one player didn't get enough wall building cards and was therefore eliminated from the battle for victory.

This streamlined version of Lowenherz sacrifices some of the depth of its predecessor for a faster gaming experience. The tradeoffs are justifiable and I'm not certain which incarnation of the game I enjoy more, although neither is a huge favorite.

With its relatively simple rules, Domaine has a really good balance of giving plenty of options without paralyzing play.  You always have more things you want to do than you have actions and you are always fighting on several fronts.  The fact that your walls help enclose opponent areas often results in surprising reversals of fortune.  Great stuff!

Oh boy do I SUCK at this! Someday, I'll figure it out, maybe. I miss the choosing/negotiation (from Lowenherz)for what you want to do each turn. It didn't seem like it ever took that long, and it was fun making others PAY for what they really wanted.

RATING: 6
A finite amount of moves to outsmart your opponenets with.  Bashing the leader is necessary here.  Wild swings of points as the final domaines are set in place can cause enormous point swings.  It plays in an hour, so that is completely ok in my book.  Its a cuthroat game for sure.  Not for the non-confrontational.  Also, not for people who take attacks against them personally.   I need to play more...... must... get.... better.....  I think positioning yourself that forces another player to kingmake for you is a valid strategy... not a fan of that.  Good times in 60 minutes.

The sweet spot with this game is right there at four players: there is lots of conflict at that level. It's one of those games where you're agonizing over the choices you have to make -- too few resources to do everything you want to right now, so you're sweating it out turn by turn. Great strategy game. This is in my top ten board games.

We have played this once as a two player game, but we forgot to place the neutral castles.  I played an unbalanced strategy, which initially put me far ahead, but ended up handing the game to her.

Very good game.  Nice components.  There are many options on every turn.  Only being able to do one thing each turn is frustrating, but fortunately, other players can only do one thing also, so if you have to play some defense and get some money, no one can screw you too badly in the meantime.  The point swings, when domains are expanded can be quite unexpected and imbalanced--in other words, I can pick up four points, and cause you to lose seven points.  But it's all in fun.  The game builds nicely and decisions have logical consequences.

The king shall return... But before he does, the realm falls into anarchy and chaos. The lords of the kingdom struggle to improve their place and standing. New borders are drawn, and expanded through strength of arms and subtle maneuver. Each duke seeks to establish a claim over the most valuable parts of the kingdom before the king finally returns. In the dark of the Middle Ages, control of the land was the key to wealth and power. Can you control enough territory to become the most prestigious duke before the king’s return?

This game has the potential to suffer from runaway leader problems if the first person to get an extra knight starts taking all his new land from the other players.

It also has a runaway loser problem, in that the easiest target is also the person who's furthest behind, putting him even further behind with every move.

Classic area enclosure game that is still good fun. However, I find I never suggest playing it, I think because it feels somewhat opaque in terms of how to do things well and how things are going to end up - there is so much variability that plans are thwarted seemingly at random. This would be ok, but it's styled as quite a serious game and can run longer if people overthink, so it's a little discordant for me.

I enjoy this one a lot. It's very nasty, but not in a nasty way, (you win by smacking down everyone, so there's no hard feelings). It's quick and as long as everyone understands how important the mines are, relatively balanced, as an early leader will get targeted, and creation of high-scoring domaines in the center of the board tend to even up early score differentials.

An area-enclosure game with a knights and castles theme.  I like this better than Lowenherz because I think that the game is better as a lighter game.  (Lowenherz is a heavier version of this that adds auctions for resources and actions.)  In this game, actions are chosen from among cards in a players hand.  The goal is to enclose large and/or valuable areas.  I can play this with family or gamers.

I seem to like the game, and won the only game I've tried, but I think I lucked out on card draws, which makes me think that the game may be too random. If you get lucky in the vital early game, you can vault ahead of your opponents, and snowball to a victory, which I did.

I really like this game.  It's easy to teach, tense, and quite challenging in spite of the apparent simplicity.   I never tried Lowenhertz, but I know that the game feels heavy enough without any negotiation element involved, so I could see the original being far less appealing.   I *do* find, however, that in virtually every game I've played, the game was ultimately decided by one player snatching a massive territory by easily creating a domaine around a castle that stayed pretty much untouched all game. Basically, as you section off space for your own domaines, you're often inadvertently doing a great job of creating a massive space for your opponent to snag with almost no effort. I'm sure that this is a significant strategic element in the game, but it seems to be a hard strategy to keep in mind and consider a defense against until it's too late.  Still, one of my most frequently-played games, at the moment.

Features runaway leader problems. Bashing mercilessly on the weakest player is a good idea. Get into a war of attrition with you neighbour and you both lose, but what can you do about it? It's not like you have that many other options. Luck of the draw is immense in this game. Very flat tension curve, initial placement of the castles seemed the most fun part. For the rest: dull, dull, dull.

RATING: 6
It's actually not a bad area control/enclosure game.  In fact, I think there are a couple of neat mechanics.  Such as the method of income, the mobile scoring, as well as the ability to expand.  However, it seems Domaine reward one as a result of someone else's poor play more often than from a good one from yourself.  Thus the problem of kingmaking is all that much prevalent, even if it is done unintentionally.

Furthermore, I dislike how seemingly pre-deterministic the initial placement of the castle pieces has on who the winner might be.  You cannot deny the advantages the corner has over the middle since it already has two "free" border in which you do not have to spend money nor time to build; and the fact is the first player can claim two of the four best spots right off the bat.

Another thing that didn't help is we did not sort the cards into their specific stacks.  So it ended up with some of us drawing really expensive and unusable ones in the beginning while others got to build cheap boundaries repeatedly.  Would probably be willing to try again but I think there are much better games with similar gameplay.

Another game we had high expectations on. Bought this one on a flea-market about six months ago for $4,- For that money, we got a game in perfect condition, probably never (or maybe once) played. The components are great, and made me want to paint them. As I’m no Rembrandt at all, I decided just to start reading the rules, and set up a game. It is an easy game. Probably to easy for us. It’s nice, but it comes down to area control and collecting money. We had not much fun with this one. I guess that’s also because we played it with two. This game might be working best with 3 or 4 players.

Parts of it reminded me of numerous other games (the card-drawing choices of [thing=50]Lost Cities[/thing], and the region expansion of [thing=12632]Goldbrãu[/thing], to name two that jump to mind), and it's a little tricky at first to understand which things give you victory points versus income; however, it was interesting to play, and pulling up from behind generally means pulling down those in the lead, which, in our case, meant a very close game.

This is kind of a meaner version of settlers. It can be played interaction lite, or mean.  You have to watch out and make sure that you don't build a lot for your opponents.  I've found that people can focus too much on building giant walls from the outset, instead of building and then expanding.  This causes a lot of frustration for them.

:thumbsdown: [b]BROKEN![/b] If you don't draw any wall cards, and the other players keep taking all of the wall cards from the common pool, then you are effectively shut out of the game and there is literally nothing you can do about it. And that's how my first (and destined to be only) game went.

The new version of Löwenherz. Plays faster and is streamlined. Both version deserve a spot on the shelf (or on the PC as there's a computer version of this one out...)

I loved the game, the whole medival taking of lands, my wife had trouble with various aspects of it like keeping track of mines for points

Played a few times. Still no clue as what is the best way to victory. I think that tells more about me than the game since it feels quite simple to play. Everyone that has played the game says it is "ok". I agree.

jeu de placement stratégique qui fait appel à un bon sens de la spatialisation; les actions à faire sont limitées dans le nombre sans que le jeu en souffre, loin de là; possibilité de revirement de situation spectaculaire si les cartes tombent ou ne tombent pas bien pour un joueur ou si un de ceux-ci ne sécurise pas assez son domaine

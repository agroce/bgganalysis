RATING: 5
I like that the game is tense till the end, it takes less time, and it solves some of the problem QB issues that it's older sibling has, but I have trouble getting it to the table for some reason...

Oddly enough, I like it best as a solo game (and I'd give it a 7 for that). With lots of people, I think the dice do a disservice in terms of coordinated planning. Yes, the dice do reduce the QB problem, but it just becomes an isolated effort a number of times. Soloing it though, is a 20min jaunt through dice rolling and tactical play. 2 pawns is good, haven't tried 3 yet. It's unpredictable enough that it becomes a fresh puzzle to crack each time.

This is a very good cooperative dice-rolling game with simple rules but lots of variability due to the different player roles in the game. The components look great and the duration is short it's a lovely filler. My only complaint is that the theme feels pasted on - the artwork and components create a nice atmosphere of "Science" but that aside, it feels like rolling dice over and over, rather than curing diseases. I think that is a result of so many of the dice featuring standard "pips" instead of custom sides. This is a minor nit-pick (because I love dice-rolling games regardless of theme).

RATING: 8
I often prefer The Cure to regular Pandemic, even with its expansions. The Cure is sufficiently different and sufficiently difficult to be set apart from regular Pandemic, and yet its theme, characters, and other similarities to its mother game scratch that Pandemic itch so many of us have. The Cure has such a quick set-up and can be played in 30 minutes or so, while it still presents some strategic choices for its players to make. The push-your-luck element helps to guard against an alpha player. HIGHLY recommended.

RATING: 6
4 plays / 2,4 players

LIKE: Rolling dice and unique powers. Quick. The dice mitigate the alpha player a bit.
DISLIKE: Escalates quickly. Theme can be bland, a map would've been better.

OVERALL: First play, missed a rule. Second play much more diverse and fun. The player powers play a big part in the game.

RATING: 5
I might have preferred this over the original Pandemic due to its faster pace and the fact that the one dominating player in the table cannot tell you what to roll. This answers the most typical problem of co-ops. I also like the possibility to push your luck with re-rolling while hoping not to rolling any biohazards. 

However, the bad news is that most of the time I found myself in a situation where there really was no incentive to re-roll. This is due to the fact that there is not much to do with your dice except move around, treat diseases and collect samples. There are no trade-offs or real options where to allocate your precious actions. This makes the game a bit too monotonous for my taste. I also heard other players complaining how boring their characters were, with nothing to do really. But I reckon it is more due to the basic mechanics of the game than the character that makes the game boring for people expecting lot of action and tough decision.

There are no fatal flaws in the game. It just is a bit boring.

RATING: 8
I'm a huge fan of the original Pandemic, and this one captures the feel of that game while at the same time bringing something different to the table.  It's a lighter, quicker version of the board game, with a bit more luck (and therefore more of a push-your-luck element).  It has the same tension and depth of decision-making.

If you thought that the original was too much of a puzzle and not a game, then I think this game could appeal to you.  The randomness of the dice means there definitely is not a perfect solution to each game (which I don't think exists for the original game, but some people do).

All in all, I think the Cure is different enough from the original for me to warrant having both in my collection.

Like it much more than original pandemic. Rolling dice always adds more personal achievement to the game while playing as opposed to one person telling everyone what to do in a game. Not that they are alphagaming but alot of people might not want to think that much and just go along with whatever other people say in Pandemic type games. Plus this game, you have tons of nice dice!

In some ways, this is actually better than Pandemic. It's definitely faster, and I think it prevents Alpha-gaming because it's more tactical due to the dice changing the situation. So I'd probably play this over the original, although the original does still have a place in my heart.

Captures the feeling of Pandemic decently in a shorter time-frame. Leaves something to be desired however. I guess the smaller footprint and the shorter time makes it feel less "epic" or "serious". Decent challenge, not the same narrative experience.

Another strong offering from Mr. Leacock.  It retains a bunch of the feel of [b]Pandemic[/b], without playing like the same game (as some dice games do).  It's neat to see the different mechanisms at work.  Great components.  It won't replace the original--[b]Forbidden Island[/b] already has!--but it will find a place on my shelf.

Dice-based Pandemic!  Plays quickly, fairly straight-forward.  The roles are varied and, more importantly, *feel* very distinct.  Very well done.

Why only an 8?  The strategies are still pretty obvious and you still have the "one ring to rule them all" (one person directing everyone else) issue.  It's a fun game, particularly for a coop, but still not my absolute fav.

Great, great game -- I prefer it to the original. You'd think a dice version would have a ton more randomness, but it's actually surprisingly strategic, and doesn't feel much more random than Pandemic's infection deck and epidemics. Excellent components, quick playtime, yet without sacrificing any of the tension of the original. And it all packs into the dice bag! 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
1st play: Fun dice filler that doesn't feel as scripted as regular Pandemic.  Granted I haven't played the original in a very long time, but this had excellent production and tons of custom dice.  Cool game and further proves that a "dice game" version can work.  The unique player powers are cool, and the co-op nature means everyone is cheering you on when you get a good roll (or groaning with you when you don't)

2nd play: The game is largely tactical.  The rounds are pretty unpredictable and the choices are usually obvious.  Still though, it's a fun co-op experience and very easy to teach.  Nice intro to Pandemic mythos.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
This takes the Pandemic/Forbidden Island chassis and complicates it with randomness through dice. If this appeals to you, the production is chunky and glossy, relaxing the Euro vibe further into family territory. 

Unfortunately, we found this makes the game harder! Although the Infection result adds tension to each roll there is little incentive to keep rolling, despite the different faces not offering much decision variation. The custom dice for each role make this game intriguing. However, turns tend to turn into ideals and failures, rather than the type of mitigation and scrambling a good dice game offers. 

Overall, an attractive package, let down by a degree of difficulty creating a group dynamic that feels like luck when you roll well, but unameliorated disaster if you aren't getting close to ideal results every turn. 

I'D RATHER PLAY: Pandemic

It is the cure for alpha players in co-op games. Please all other co-ops study this and apply the principles. The difficulty is a bit high when you read the FAQ from the developer to clarify the rule ambiguity in the sparse rule book.

Intrresting, fast paced game with dice. A lot of dice. You'd better like rolling dice because this game is exclsively about that. 
The box is huge compared to components, probably to be able to put all future extensions inside of it. 

Components are of good quality, and the game is quite enjoyable, especially solo. I'm not completely convinced about the "no real board" aspect of the game. 

A good game, but it won't replace "Pandemic", that's for sure.
Mechanics worth 6, but fast setup and game make it a game i play with more regularity than a lot of depper games.

Was really surprised by this one as I didn't think it would be any good. Essentially Pandemic the dice game.

Great little dice game that offers a lot of challenge.

RATING: 9
All the tense game play and co-operative interaction of the regular Pandemic board game are here. But with dice!!Yes this game comes with a huge amount of dice. Dice that are guaranteed to have you screaming "No! Not in Europe! That's an outbreak!" And instead of simply using actions set forth by the rule book you get actions decided by the dice you roll. Fortunately you can re-roll the dice, Yahtzee style, to try and get what you need to save the world. Unfortunately you cannot re-roll those dice when the bio-hazard symbol comes up. That too will have you screaming "Come on!" Don't believe me? watch Rahdo Run Through this one. You will laugh yourself silly at his misfortune. We think the only negative point of The Cure is that the game doesn't let up. In Pandemic you get lulls in the horrific pestilences. Not so in this one. But regardless it is still fun and we think that if you like Pandemic you'll like Pandemic The Cure.

I feel more often than not dice versions of great games are simplified / dumbed down / express versions of the real deal (not necessarily a bad thing, just saying).

This game though is so cleverly implemented with the custom dice for abilities and for the regions where diseases turn up that I am actually enjoying this more than regular Pandemic.

Most exciting for me is the additional push your luck factor - do I reroll risking the advance of the infection rate or try to make a suboptimal move with what I rolled?

Fantastic game.

PROS:  Components were simple but adequate and excellent.  Very quick setup/teardown.  Easy to learn.  Variable game times, but a lot of flexibility.

CONS:
some of the holes in the ring were too small for the syringe markers but easily fixed.  I used my dissection scissors and widened the holes slightly.  It's a dice game, so if you don't like dice, it's not your game.

RATING: 7.5
Wow. Take two types of boardgames I'm not very fond of - dice games and cooperative games - _combine them_, and suddenly there's quite a gem of a game. It's very swift to play and it's much more exciting than the usual pretty dry exercise of a cooperative game. The different roles feel very well chosen and distinct, leading to (probably, hopefully) high replayability. I'm impressed!

Despite that, the dice cause a whole lot of randomness, and it's quite possible to suffer instant defeat from an otherwise safe position. Only the short playtime makes this (barely) acceptable.

As one would suspect with a dice game, the decisions are largely tactical and the tension hinges on a gambling sensation. Unfortunately, such randomization wears on me and falls flat. To me, the game feels more like an activity than anything that could be played seriously. And if you did manage to play the game with a competitive mindset, you likely will experience the alpha-gamer problem, which plagues many co-op games. 

Some gamers are going to absolutely adore this game. The component quality is top notch and the gameplay is very fluid/intuitive. But it isn't my type of game.

This is a refreshing take on Pandemic which really ramps up the chaos and mayhem to the game. Great for players who enjoy the addition of chance/randomness from dice games with the co-operation of classic pandemic. 

Choices are much tougher as the dice rolls add cruel twists to the best laid plans. We lost 4 games in a row, quite spectacularly but everyone enjoyed playing. It forces you to change up how you play and plan with the dice. 

I could see pure strategy gamers getting frustrated as this game does take away your ability to plan meticulously and has a heavy luck element. Still I think most pandemic fans will enjoy this new take on the game. The luck and dice make it easier for new players and super simple to play/learn. I can see this hitting out table quite a few nights as its a good balance between strategy co-op and lighter game play. 

One I'll re-buy once my roommate who owns it moves out.

First play was a little disappointing.  We very likely got a rule or two wrong but it felt very easy.  There wasn't much tension and the game moved slower (with 5 players) than I was expecting.  There was almost none of the "push-your-luck" element in the game that I was expecting.

Good game, a nice change from the regular Pandemic.

At least as good as Pandemic. Hopefully it won't replace it, but it's alot of fun. Pandemic is harder to play, but also harder to win I feel (after 1 Cure play)

At the time of writing this review I have only played 3 legitimate games of Pandemic: The Cure (1 we accidentally cheated xD) and have lost all of them (except the one we cheated :P)

This game is fun and engaging! a good combination of luck and strategy. There have been plenty of scenarios where bad dice have screwed my team over, but at the same time, a good roll in an unlikely situation is incredibly satisfying.

I am really fond of this game at the moment, however I currently fail to see much replay-ability once we have cleared the heroic campaign. At this point in time though, I can't get enough of this game.

Great to bust out if you have less than an hour, but want a deeper game than your average filler.

I like dice, so this is a natural fit. As a fan of the original, where this excels is in its speed of play. There's not much discussion since your options are, dare I say, controlled by the dice you roll. We're winless to this point, but because the game plays faster, you don't walk away feeling as defeated as you do in the original, and usually you just reset the dice and go at it again. I'll update this when I know if winning gives the same elated reaction.

Do you like pandemic, but hate the idea of going around the world as a team, fighting disease, and developing cures? Then this is the game for you! Oh wait, actually not nvm. 

Do you like pandemic, but hate the large board, long playtime, the somewhat complex rules? Then you'll love this game! Its Pandemic Lite! Mechanics are simplified, but with the disease-fighting theme we all know and love. But wait there's more! The curing mechanic is also totally different, but really neat in its own way.

The randomness of the dice did not appeal to me for how this game works... it does work for me in Flash Point and I'm not 100% sure why. I won't really look to play this again, but I might in a situation with people who really want to get it played.

Everything in this game derives from the older board game. It is a well done variant, that keeps many aspects of the game and transfers it to a dice game. The problem is, all the stuff the transferred from the board game does not make any sense in a dice game. Everything makes sense if you know the board game, but if you do not know it you are lost. Furthermore the board game offered plenty of interesting decisions. The dice game disables the mid term planning that makes the board game version interesting. So all in all this is a boring experience, that is really hard to teach to players unacquainted with the board game.

Pandemic "the dice" is more accurate. Interestingly, though it is dice based, I find this one to be more focused, and slightly less lucky than traditional pandemic. Most games are very close, it's easier to grasp, quicker to setup, more consistent in play time, and who doesn't love a big bag o' dice?

In short, I like everything about "the cure" more than pandemic, and it is a mainstay for my wife and I.

When we played this I kept thinking of what a well designed game it was. It does a really good job of reproducing the theme and feel of the original Pandemic. That said it is a great game on it's own. I like the way you need to limit your actions by trading in dice to search for a cure. The push your luck nature of rolling the dice to try and get the actions you give a different type of choice you don't get in the original game. The game we played, we were one player away from a probable win when outbreaks did us in. I really enjoyable game.

Amazing co-op, and it fixes my biggest problem with Pandemic, which is the tendency for an alpha player. The random dice rolling still leaves an ability to try planning ahead, but puts a lot of decisions in each player's hands rather than "if you want to win 98% of the time, let me take your turns for you and enjoy watching me play solo."

Fantastic dice implementation of Pandemic.

It is streamlined, easy to set up, quicker to play, and still feels incredibly rewarding.

The dice do leave room for a more swingy game, but because of the short play time I don't mind as much when I get hosed by the dice....we just play again! 

The dice rolling to cure gives room to take risks based on probability (i.e. I have two red dice and the Scientist, I theoretically could cure now so I'll use my last action to treat a dice instead of take another sample). The dice rolling for actions creates some incredibly tense push-your-luck moments that just aren't there in the base game.

I might change my mind after playing Pandemic, but at this point I don't see any reason to play Pandemic again

   I don't know why games like this insist on riding the coat-tails of a known success.  Yes, this is a dice version of Pandemic, but it is different enough from the board game, that it almost warrants its own name.

   Excessive re-rolling, and finicky pegs on the plastic tracker took away from what is a decent game.  You're best off playing someone else's copy...

wow, I was really surprised how much my family has enjoyed this game, it was not on my radar to purchase at all but saw it half off at B&N and thought I would give it a try just because I love specialty dice, and there are a lot of dice in this game.  We love that we always feel like there is so much each person can do on their turn and since you never know what the dice will roll there's no perfect solution on every turn (unlike with regular pandemic) so everyone feels free to make their own choices ultimately.

If you win, less people die. What a cruel and bizarre theme for a "game". That it is one of the most popular titles and available everywhere is a sad testimony to the state of modern society; how will people feel about owning this when the next massively fatal and contagious disease hits?

I have nothing against science or reality based games - for a title which is far less morbid there is Stop the Germs (PNP): https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/142902/stop-germs and
Virus! https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/180020/virus

There is also Healing Blade:

https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/179322/healing-blade-defenders-soma

Pandemic is a perfect example of what unfettered capitalism and mob mentality inflicts on all of us - there are many ways to make a game about the same subject matter (I live not much more than walking distance from the CDC and count many epidemiologists there as close friends) morally and in a way that respects life - in the case of Pandemic, simply changing fatalities to number of infections would be a start. Infectious diseases do not exist outside the context of global politics and society and Pandemic's crass and banal approach to the inequalities of our world is simply repugnant. 

It's also a poor game as pointed out by many other reviewers. Barnes and Noble, how I loathe thee for popularizing such thoughtless "games".
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
I really wanted to enjoy this game, and so my thoughts are a little biased.  I REALLY DID enjoy this game, even when I got quite a big rule wrong.  I didn't realize there was a benefit to curing diseases other than getting to win the game.  So in this first game, until my third play with Heather we played you still got to take just one cube of a colour after a virus was cured, rather than all the same colour in a section.  But this game is still absolutely brilliant.  The dice specific to a character, how the world just gets taken over so quickly.  The fact that one epidemic basically just creates 4 at a time.  I want more of this game, and I am looking forward to more of it.

It's a nifty variant on Pandemic, but I can't imagine ever playing it over Pandemic. It can also be confusing when you expect something to work the Pandemic way and it doesn't.

That all sounds very negative, but the game was fun. It was fun trying to figure out how we could all come together to win. Although, because of how cures are obtained, it likely requires a little more group planning than Pandemic in order to win, as you have to get those dice to one player.

RATING: 7
Holy crap! Can it be...? A dice game spinoff that's actually WORTH playing? Why yes, friends, turns out that is exactly what Pandemic: The Cure is!

Okay so mostly I'm going to be talking about this in comparison to the original game, as I suspect (like me) that will be most people's experience with it, but just know that if you haven't played Pandemic and either like co-op games or want to give one a shot, this is a really good game and well worth your time. Moreso than the original game? Depends on your preference for dice, I guess. This is probably a little more replayable than base Pandemic on its own, but not when compared to expansions of course.

Onto the comparisons!

The Cure is a little simpler in terms of learning to play and general rules to remember (i.e., nothing to throw newcomers off like direct vs. charter flight; "sharing information", etc.) It is a nice, clean system that uses the bare minimum of rules to maximum effect - it is easier to learn, but possibly even harder to master.

I'm unsure that this would make a better gateway game, however as the game feels a little drier and less themeatic on a whole. The narrative element of watching diseases spread throughout the world has been replaced with a feeling of abstraction. This is probably the kind of thing that would turn off non-gamers, unless your friends are serious number junkies.

The good news is, what it lacks in theme it makes up for in a greater differentiation between the roles. Because each role has not only its own special power, but its own set of dice with different percentage chances to get different actions (e.g., the medic is more likely to roll treatments, whereas the scientist is more likely to roll sample collection for cures), you really feel like your role is BETTER at doing something than everyone else's. This is probably my favorite part about the game as everyone now feels their characters strengths and weaknesses and come out feeling more or less equally important on the whole.

Because there's less actions in general, the feeling puzzle-like optimization of your turns is less strong. Instead, your turn is emotionally and strategically centered around the tension of pressing your luck. This is probably not a game for dice haters, but if you want to see dice done well then look no further.

The Cure probably has a higher luck factor than the original game - I say this because like the original game, you can lose entirely due to poor luck... but UNLIKE the original game, you can also WIN due to luck. This might throw people off at first, as Pandemic is known for being punishing, and it does feel a little underwhelming to win just because you happened to keep rolling currency instead of diseases, but the game is somewhat shorter than the original, so if you have a kind of underwhelming play, you can always just try again.

For the most part, though, everything is impeccably balanced and MOST of your games you will win or lose by the skin of your teeth, and whenever you lose you will wonder what would have happened if you hadn't decided to re-roll that plane.

Our only real confusion with the game came from not having the 'treatment center' labeled. I'm sort of unclear as to why this was made just a hole in the center instead of a labeled part of the board, but once you remember the term it doesn't really matter.

On that note, the presentation of the game is adorable and has that "ooh? what is THIS game? It looks cool!" kind of factor (those cute badges for the roles!), but is also part of the reason the game does not feel as themeatic to me. In the original game, sure you're pushing around cubes, but whole board ended up looking like a map of infected cities, with pushpins to represent threats, and you could really see the diseases travel. Here, the circular floating continents might look cooler and more novel, but also make it feel more abstract.

And on the note of components - the hole for our "0" on the infection track is a bit small and the peg only barely fits. I sort of wouldn't be surprised if many people experienced issues like this. I'm sure a lot of people would have been happier with a more standard board with token trackers instead of cute pegs for this reason. It feels a little bit like form over function.

If you like Pandemic, this is absolutely a must play (unless you are SERIOUSLY dice averse, but honestly, even if you usually are, this is probably still worth trying).

Not sure about this one. As a frequent roller of improbably poor dice results, it's frustrating to think my game can get ruined on a bad toss, no matter how strong our plans.

Basically this is Pandemic: The Dice Game.
I like this a lot better than normal Pandemic.  The fact that you can press your luck on the dice rolls kind of alleviates the alpha gamer problem.  It also seems to play a bit quicker.
With dice involved, it is more random than the original Pandemic, which probably makes the original a "better" game.  I'm fine admitting that.  I'll just say I have more fun playing the dice version.

My recommendation would be this: If you LOVE original Pandemic, skip this game.  Just buy some expansions for the Original or the Legacy version.  If you thought original Pandemic was ok, but it didn't really excite you, give this one a try.

"Players can roll their dice as often as they like, but the more times they re-roll for the perfect turn"

Okay, this is just evil. I love it. Also, dice-rolling Pandemic with specialised custom dice is just too good.

We had a very lucky first game in all rolls involved, but we did come close to losing in pretty much all three ways. Does this game have non-obvious choices? Probably, though certainly less than Pandemic. Is it press-your-luck? Not that much, or at least it is unlike other press-your-luck games with an element of "more or nothing" which doesn't exist in The Cure, where pressing your luck and failing doesn't make you lose immediately, but brings you ever so closer to it.

Translates pandemic to dice and succeeds in an enjoyable way. Gameplay can be more swingy than regular pandemic (infection dice being drawn from the bag, having to roll 13+ to cure a disease etc.), as is to be expected of a dice game. The ability to reroll dice as often as you'd like paired with the risk of rolling biohazards adds a layer of desperate push-your-luck tension.

Taking a game that I already know and love, and simplifying it slightly while adding some extra randomness...it's just a great idea. I actually felt invigorated to go back and play the original because of the fun experience of the dice version.

The Cure also adds an interesting challenging element in finding those cures - it's not a foregone conclusion. Building up your chances by taking more samples is very clever. There's also the scary element of having all those dice sitting in the middle if an epidemic comes up, so you've got one more element to keep under control.

This game reminds me of a really good expansion - it enhances the original game in new and exciting ways, but doesn't change the fundamentals. I think this is likely another game I'm going to have to buy in the near future.

I bought this at Essen and played it a couple of days ago in a group of 4.  We randomly pulled the dispatcher, the scientist, the containment specialist and the medic.  The setup is ridiculously quick.  Reading the rules takes 10 minutes max, and explaining them to the group is quick too.  It really is a game you can pull out and play very quickly.

I loved the mechanics and how the theme had been adapted into a dice game.  It is visually attractive also and component quality is good.

Having said that, we found the game was not very challenging.  We played the 'standard' game (not the intro or harder settings).  We double checked the rules multiple times to see if we were missing something but, no, it was just easy.  We ended with all 4 cures in place, only 2 outbreaks and the epidemics were so easy to manage well (timing them so there was nothing in the treatment centre when they happened).  It could also be that we were just rolling really well and got very lucky with the dice.

My initial impression, however, is that it is very much Pandemic 'light' - good for introducing new people to gaming or as a relatively quick, stressless filler game.

I'd be interested in playing this again with different characters, as the dispatcher and containment specialist are a particularly effective combination.  With different characters it could be more challenging.

Has the flavour, theme and feel of Pandemic but with the mechanic of a mega dice fest.

Each character has their own custom dice and special abilities.

Of course there's random-ness with all the dice chucking but there's lots of agonising decisions to be made about how best to use your dice to combat the diseases.

Pandemic is a favourite game in our house and The Cure is a different enough we like playing both.  Players do seem to play more independently in The Cure which makes it fun for all and the gameplay is less intimidating than Pandemic.

Played this on Saturday at SPIEL 2014 and in my opinion the best and most fun game I played all weekend. The american demoing the game (his name was Dow?) also did a great job of explaining it and really pulled us into the game, thanks a lot!

Here a summary of things I liked:

:star: We played the game in about 30 to 45 minutes with 5 players. Perfect playing time for a dice game.

:star: The Alpha Leader syndrome seen in a lot of co-op games is mostly negated by the push-your-luck element of the dice.

:star: Every role uses their own custom dice. But that doesn't mean you are restricted to a certain play style, you just do some things better! The unique abilities of every role are also a cool addition.

:star: The whole infection, sampling and curing mechanic are very engaging and fun.

:star: The CDC events are helpful and make for another fun gaming element.

:star: Teamwork! You really need to help each other with sampling diseases to win this game.

There's exceptions to rules. Here's a game where dice are diverse and you have to think about what options you wish to take with them. But you know what? This game is pointless. This game is a sham and a money grab. And I cannot at all fathom why people would purchase or enjoy this game over the original Pandemic it is adapted from.

Seriously, the original Pandemic is superior in every way I can imagine. And it's not like this version is faster to play or cheaper to buy. In fact, you don't even have the availability and variety of expansion module options with The Cure. When you're playing, there's the lack of strategy that comes from being semi-informed and having some prediction of what can happen. And instead of freedom over your player actions, you're limited by the random chance of die-rolls. So why do people like it?!

Rating: 6
Because it is indeed, in it's own isolated right, a decently designed game.

But seriously, why does this game need to exist when the original is still better?

This is great fun, but I'm worried it's too easy.  The actions are all pretty powerful so that pushing one's luck to the point of danger isn't often necessary.  We'll see.

In some ways I prefer it to regular Pandemic: it reduces the "solved puzzle" problem to a certain extent because of the dice rolls. However, it is also very swingy - a couple of horrendous dice rolls and you can go from the brink of victory to 8 outbreaks in the blink of an eye.

Despite the awesome component quality on the small colored dice, both custom sets of disease dice and role dice and all that, the game still isn't a very compelling game for me to play.

That being said, it appears to be a well designed game. It just isn't for me.

Once you mix in the rules to maintain the theme and balance the game with asymmetric dice, it's more complex than the original board game and takes about as long to play. About the only thing this version has over the original is that there is more randomness to the game so it's easier to detach from the loss and walk away. There's no room in the collection for this game if you already own Pandemic and very little reason to get this version unless you just like chucking dice.

Someone else beat me to it, but it's true: Pandemic The Cure is to Pandemic as Ra The Dice Game is to Ra, namely, an impeccable dice implementation of the original. Both dice versions retain the originals' flavors but stand on their own as different enough experiences to warrant keeping them as well as the originals. Re-rolling a lot seems to be the key to doing well in Pandemic the Cure, but it's a difficult game to win.

A solid reimplementation of Pandemic that has enough new mechanisms to feel like a different game. (Unlike Caylus Magna Carta.) The dice are great and the opportunities for interaction are high.

This dice game has some nice features.  I like how the character's powers are largely implemented by giving them different dice.  The game also presents some interesting choices.

Almost a 7! So close, it's rather fun, but the decisions don't feel as weighty or tense as regular Pandemic - but I do adore how easy it is to set-up, play, and put away! I did win my very first game however (on standard) so that rated it down a bit - I'm sure higher difficulties will kick my booty much like regular Pandemic does.

Considering that it's a dice game, I can't fault the randomness, and it's here in spades - thankfully the ability to reroll as many times as you want help mitigate that along with some healthy push-your-luck mechanism.

On the whole, I do wish it came with a board rather than the discs - there's a thread in the forum discussing it and I rather agree that having a world map makes it more personable than it being just "dice" on the table.

This won't be replacing Pandemic the board game anytime soon, but it'll stay in my collection for those times when you got that Pandemic itch, but not the Pandemic time~

The adaptation of Pandemic into a dice game was an interesting one: Unique roles with unique dice tied to that role, interesting abstraction of the board, very cool components, elements of the Lab scenario in this base game (needing samples to cure), the game is very portable if you use an alternative box, and has a definite push-your-luck mechanism. I really like how quick it is to set this up and play compared to Pandemic. 

Unfortunately, I don't really like when you have very few options on your turn. When you use dice to collect samples, you may not have many dice in your pool and if you roll biohazard symbols, you can literally have nothing to do on your turn. This is the aspect of the game that's most unacceptable to me. There also felt like a lack of variety... especially among the event cards. I won't knock it too much for that, however, since I felt the normal Pandemic's base game also lacked variety and the first expansion alleviates this issue. 

I feel like the hardest decisions in this game are whether you should push your luck or not. It could entirely be my perception, but I feel less in control of winning and losing in this game than the original game. That said, the game does get more interesting as you continue to play it. I say this because when you realize there are 12 of each colour of infection dice and can calculate (or estimate) the probability of drawing certain colored dice. You also have to manage the dice in each of the 6 locations, the CDC (because more CDC dice means less are in the bag), and how many infection dice are in the bag. It's almost like a communal bag building game.

Since there are no hands of cards and a quicker setup, I would consider this one a good solo play option. Overall, this is a pretty good game. Especially, if you like dice games. It's unfortunate that this game needs Experimental Meds for variety and is more expensive than base Pandemic due to the custom dice.

Compared to the board game Pandemic, this dice version moves the game play from strategic to tactical, simply because you can't plan your next moves until you roll the dice. That said, although I typically like strategy games more than tactical ones, in this case I like Pandemic: The Cure quite a bit more than the original board game. First of all because the roles really come through a lot more. Instead of just having a card that describes your role, you have a unique set of dice that really brings the character's unique ability to life. Speaking of dice, they are nice, custom dice that are fun to roll! I really enjoy that the dice rolling mechanism isn't Yahtzee-style but rather you can roll the dice as many times as you are willing to risk (until you use them or roll bio hazard symbols that lock them up). Finally, I like this game more than the original board game because it is noticeably faster to set up, teach, play, and clean up.

Liked it more 3p than 5p, although the latter was marked with some terrible luck on cure rolls that cost us the game.

Contains an impressive number of custom dice -- even the infection dice are not standard six siders.

Played this at GOBfest 2016. Though fun and a somewhat different feel than your standard Pandemic game, I found the difficulty level seemed to drop quite significantly in the Cure version (card threats versus dice rolls, I guess) and I just didn't feel the same tension and atmosphere was there without the map and the little cube outbreaks. I may have lost interest in playing Pandemic, but this certainly wasn't the solution to my apathy...

While it's by definition a more random, and thus less fair game than the original Pandemic, Pandemic: The Cure captures all of the tension in a shorter, more hectic game.  It's crazy fun, and I can't wait to see what's in store in terms of expansions.

Few things will make you say "ohhh crap...." as fast as when you get an epidemic with a big pile of dice in the treatment center, then draw a bunch of the same color dice from the bag too.  Rolling that huge fistful of dice is both terrifying and oddly satisfying.

It's enough like Pandemic that it is easy to teach/learn for Pandemic players, but different enough in gameplay that it's worth owning even if you own Pandemic, and worth trying even of you didn't like Pandemic.

Pandemic is one of my favorite games of all time. While I figured a Pandemic dice game would be fun, I didn't expect it to be as good as it is. The Cure completely changes the mechanics of Pandemic, but manages to retain the tension, the flow, and the cleverness of design that Pandemic had. I'm not sure which one I like better, and it will probably change depending on my mood, but the fact that The Cure rivals the awesomeness of Pandemic is saying a lot. Great design.

I was looking for a quick Pandemic; that could be taken camping or traveling. This kinda fits that bill?
It's alright. It is fast, but its also simpler and random. not that that makes it easy, it can blow up on you real fast.
For a game like this, I wish the few tokens were plastic; making it weather/rain proof. good camping game contender I think.

Pandemic: The Dice Game is excellent.  It maintains the feel and panic of Pandemic, while in general being lighter and easier to setup and tear down.

Each of the 15ish characters having their own set of custom dice was also a great idea.

The design choices for the game are thorougly thought out. The unique die elements, the way the pips on each disease die add up, the way the game tracker works, the iconography, the way players interact. the WORST thing I can say about this game is that there could have been a cheat sheet for epidemics and breakouts included. So much fun - quick set up and a shorter more intense presentation of all the tenseness the original game brings to the table.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Difficult dice game that captures the essence of Pandemic with the challenge of avoiding the loss conditions while simultaneously working towards victory condition.  More random than Pandemic due the nature of rolling dice.  Enjoy the unique dice for each character, really creates a lot of different possibilites and interactions that vary from game to game.   After few plays, it looks very difficult with two players versus four.  I'd recommend playing 2 characters each in a 2p game.

Excellent game! It really streamlined Pandemic although feels like a completely new game other than the theme underneath. It sets up very quickly and the rule book is short. It's very easy to learn particularly if you've already played the original Pandemic. It's not so easy to beat that you'll get board with it. Eliminating the cards and using dice makes this setup in about 5 minutes. If it's already set up and played, then a reply might take 2 minutes. It's just a quick shuffle of the cards, grabbing a character role, and rolling the set up dice and you're ready to rock.

One of the few games that I've added to my collection recently that was already owned by someone else in the group.

Super impressed with how they've condensed the core ideas of Pandemic in to an easy to setup, play and replay kind of game! You can finish this (win or lose) in under 30 minutes. The dice are fun to roll, there are some tense (not overly so however) decisions to be made. Everything is functional and easy to follow. It's even fairly fun solo (I'd recommend playing 2 characters though.)

The game is solid and quicker than the boardgame, but not 30 minutes.  For me, the abstraction from the map to the continents as discs makes me care far less about success, so I'd say it is a level of abstraction too far for me.  I'd be curious what people who have never played the board game think of this iteration.

It will never replace Pandemic, which is my favorite game, but it does differentiate itself in a fun way. Infections are much more random than the draw pile, so the game feels more tactical and less of a puzzle. Still it is very fun. The character abilities integrate in to the game perfectly. You can play the odds or push your luck, which are two lesser used mechanics in the original game. I also like the fact that I can setup and play 2 or even 3 games solo in the time it takes me to lug out Pandemic, now with 3 expansions worth of stuff, and play a single game.

To be entirely honest, I'm not 100% sure why I enjoy the Pandemic games as much as I do--but make no mistake, I find them incredibly fun. This is no exception. 
The dice for actions are nothing new (pretty standard press-your-luck) but giving each role a unique die is brilliant. The diseases being dice themselves also lets you play with the odds in a satisfying way.

For me, this game exceeds the original Pandemic. I've found it to contain more moments of excitement and risk-taking, while still maintaining the tension and planning of the original game.

Having custom dice for each role, rather than a simple special ability, really makes you want to play again and again to try all the different experiences. Really hoping for an expansion to add even more of this. 

This seems to play faster with less fiddling about of card stacks. It also offers more choices about resource management beyond just simple actions. 

On the downside, several of the dice are a bit wonky, which seems to be a common problem. Otherwise, production values are great as well.

Has a lot of the feel of Pandemic but makes good use of dice rolling. Overall enjoyable and doesn't feel too redundant compared to the original.

This re-imagining of Pandemic as a dice game is one of the best reworks I've seen of any game in years.  The balancing mechanics in play for which dice to treat into the center or out to the bag with the risk of re-rolling them in one of two different ways is genius.  Risk-reward and randomness make this a thrill to play if you're a fan of the original Pandemic and throwing a lot of dice.

Pretty Much Pandemic-lite. It's a pretty solid game with simple mechanics and really great components. The dice are good quality and the game takes up a small amount of space, making it an ideal travel game.

Very true to the original game: [thing=30549][/thing], an amazing conversion from cards to dice. I prefer gambling feeling created by dice than the tactical feelings of using cards. I like the event cards in Cure. So for me, it's slightly better than the original one.

I'll admit, I'm not a fan of very lengthy games. To my surprise Pandemic The Cure didn't play much faster than its counterpart... But it felt shorter, more exciting and more fun! The Cure offers fast-paced, high-octane gameplay that keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout. The dice rolling and character-specific movement lets each player feel involved in the game, while still forcing players to strategize and communicate between each other before making important plays. There's no alpha gamers high-jacking your The Cure playthrough as with the original Pandemic. Massive moments of shock, relief and heartache ensues as a dice roll or decision can make or break many plays - but it all feeds into the enjoyment. In The Cure, the whole team gets to feel part of the fast-paced, tactical gameplay and enjoy it all the same. The Cure addresses some issues I had with the original Pandemic and I'm likely to recommend this over the original.

No es el pandemic normal, ¡ni falta que le hace! 
ME parece divertidísimo y muy adictivo. Más sencillo y rápido que su hermano mayor pero igualmente emocionante. Muy buen juego, eso sí, algo caro. Aunque lo cierto es que, tras un par de partidas, se te olvida lo que costó y merece la pena.

For my money, this dice version of Pandemic captures all of what's fun about Pandemic while reducing playtime and setup. It's still a little more susceptible to quarterbacking than I prefer, but it's a solid co-op.

The Cure is an improvement over the original Pandemic because it solves the quarterbacking and over-analyzing issues in that game by using dice. Gone are the debates about how one series of events is more likely to occur than another, replaced with discussions about how much risk one is willing to take on in order to finish the game.

I'd play this any day over the original base game. Hopefully it will get the expansion treatment that the original game received.

Pandemic theme, but with dice.  It plays a lot different, so you don't really get the same experience.  But you're still cooperating and saving the world and stuff.  Update: I know a guy who thinks this game is too easy, even on hard mode, and after a couple of plays, I'm not sure he's wrong.  Unless we're getting a rule wrong.

Dice, dice, more dice. Simpler version of Pandemic for even quicker setup and play where everything is based on dice and pushing your luck with rolls.

The upside is the quick setup time and easy to explain ruleset but it really all just comes down to dice rolls so there's a bit of randomness to contend with. All it takes is some unlucky infection rolls to make things go from bad to worse.

Initial Rating: 5.5 (January 2015)

I really dislike Pandemic, so I wasn't expecting much from Pandemic: The Cure, still the game managed to entertaining me for a while so I think it is ok.

The art is also ok but the custom dice are really gorgeous as is the Treatment Center and the player's ID badges. 

The game is really hard but only because it has lots of uncontrollable luck, not because the game is hard to figure, that is, Pandemic: The Cure doesn't have interesting decisions, most are obvious. Also I feel the game is harder with fewer players, with more, the players have access to more special powers and have to move a lot less around the globe saving actions. Due to this, I think its sweet spot is 3 players, with more I begin to feel an excessive downtime for such a simple game. 

Some characters are clearly better than others (unbalanced) but as the game is a CoOp I don't mind. 

The playtime is around the 45 minute mark and that's the best feature of the game. This also makes the game a lot better than its predecessor for me. 

Bottom line, Pandemic The Cure is an ok game but it failed to really excite me. It is very light with easy to explain rules. I think I will sell it soon although It pains me a bit because I really like the dice. I think it can be a great family game. I would play again if requested.

Pandemic: The Dice Version. You're still playing collectively against the game, but this time there's no eradicating diseases… if the dice colour comes up, you roll it. What makes the game most challenging, though, is that they aren't your typical dice: the disease colours have different allotments per colour (so some aren't so easily cured) while EACH role has its own set of dice with different abilities. The hard version *is* hard. All in all, it's a fun -- but different -- approach to Pandemic.

PLUS: unique dice, different approach to same theme, easy to learn, challenging
MINUS: bad rolls can turn players off

I like this better than the boardgame. 
The game loses the board and cards and replaces them with six locations and individual player dice. The diseases are now dice as opposed to cubes and instead of collecting cards to find a cure you need to make a dice roll which feels better to me. I also like the pace of this game more than the original.

This was fun - but the theme seemed to be lacking a bit. Will have to give this one a few more plays. Faster than Pandemic, and chucking dice is always fun, but the randomness and lack of bad roll mitigation makes this significantly more luck based. Think I would rather just play regular pandemic.

Played 8 times Dec 2014

Thankfully the push your luck element is very minimal. Biohazards are pretty bad, but they're a resource you need to manage. If you have a useless action then you have to decide if taking a biohazard is acceptable, if it is you roll the die, if it isn't you don't. You don't need to use every action die to it's fullest potential to win so you don't feel the need to constantly push your luck. 

I think the game manages luck really well. You can certainly loose or win due to streaks, but that's unavoidable and usually you have a tight game that comes down to the wire and had some interesting decisions. The various roles are distinct and add a lot of variety to the gameplay, as does the event deck.

It's easy to explain and plays fast. 

-------------------------------------------------------
Read rules Oct 2014

I'm finding it hard to judge this game from the rules alone. I don't have access to the role cards and the player dice. Additionally my main concern is the amount of luck, and that's not easy to assess in a rigorous way.

The broad adaptation of the board game to a dice version is well done. The mechanics seem well thought out. Players roll role-specific action dice on their turn, these dice may show actions or a biohazard icon. If it's the latter the infection track is advanced and an epidemic may occur (you see them coming, each biohazard advances a track and epidemics occur at fixed locations). You can re-roll actions freely, but you risk rolling biohazards. You can spend actions freely which removes the die from play until your next turn. This aspect of the game is push-your-luck. Which doesn't grab me. Although I do enjoy Can't Stop, but that is a pure push-you-luck game and half the fun is failing.

The diseases are dice, different colours for different diseases. There are 6 locations numbered 1 through 6. All dice are 6 sided cubes, however different coloured dice have different number distributions so they pile up on certain locations. If more than 3 dice of the same colour build up then an outbreak occurs and dice of that colour in excess of 3 move to the adjacent location in descending numeric order (except that dice on space 6 move to space 1 when outbreaking). When dice are added to the board, such as at the end of a turn or during an epidemic, they are drawn from a bag. This aspect of the game has a couple layers of luck. First the colour of the dice is random and then the location they land on is random. You will know which dice are in the bag, so there is some similarity to the board game here... but it seems 'worse'.

I'll stop here. I think the game has promise and I'm sure I'll get a chance to play it. It doesn't take long and the rules are easy to explain. It will be interesting to read this later and compare my thoughts after playing. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Great dice game that takes the theme and feel of Pandemic and distills it down to a Yahtzee-style dice roller. Is it as good as Pandemic? Well, no. The Cure never QUITE feels as tight and narratively satisfying as its big brother. But it’s close, going the extra mile to maintain at least some of the globe-trotting logistics of the base game. And if you like solo games, this is one of my favorite. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
*May* have replaced standard Pandemic for me. Gives all of the tension of the original, increased player interaction(?), with the bling of custom dice and a much tighter play time. Will need more plays to know for sure, but this is definitely a keeper.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Clearly, this is the dice version of Pandemic. It suffers from being prone to bossing even more than Pandemic itself, probably due to the dice determining the available actions. It could as well be played by a single player as each round the challenge is for all players to most effectively solve the puzzle of making the best out of the respective dice roll with no hidden information or time pressure to avoid the bossing syndrome. I don't think that it's a good idea to let the dice decide the difficulty of the puzzle or even making it impossible to solve the puzzle. Still, it works and is somehow appealing as a Pandemic-themed puzzle passtime.

I feel this fixes the problems of the alpha gamer in Pandemic. It sits at about the right weight of a coop for me and I love the custom dice. The only thing I wasn't a huge fan of was how the outbreaks worked. They seemed like weak sauce compared to the outbreaks of the original game.

Review after 1 play.
Rules are easy to understand and game plays very quickly.  Very different feel from Pandemic.  Gameplay is quicker and more hectic. If Pandemic is soccer, this is hockey.  Luck has bigger impact in this game but mechanic to allow rerolls does address this and provides a fun press-your-luck element.  Ultimately a nice deviation from Pandemic.  Different enough to warrant owning if you enjoy the genre/theme.

While I like dice, I'm not a huge fan of this dice version of Pandemic. 

The premise remains the same - stop the virus before it stops you - but the mechanics are entirely different, and I find them a bit clunky, and cause the theme to vanish.

Nice, quick little filler to start or end the night with.

Very good component quality, fast to set up and tear down. Overall a good game.

I do wonder though... without the success of it's big brother/predecessor, would it still have been as popular? I'm just not sure it stands that well on it's own... lot of the best stuff about the game (like the translucent dice) are obvious references to/influenced by the bigger, coop Pandemic. As a standalone it probably would feel like a pasted on theme.

For me, Pandemic is okay. It feels too abstract to me and never immerses me into the tension, but I cant deny the good puzzle it presents. For me, I enjoy the Cure more. The randomness/probability control, and watching different peoples risk taking tendancies is a lot of fun. It also handles alpha gaming well with less known information and the possession of each player having their own dice. I think it is highly underated.

2017-02-19 - 6 - I played once solo by now. It's fine. Setup and gameplay is quick. I really like different dice for every character. Although it wasn't as exciting as regular Pandemic. But I'm pretty sure I will try it again, maybe with more players and different set of characters. Not every 6 rated game (which means fine) is automatically leaving my collection.

2017-02-27 - 6->5 - Disappointing. Lacks this engaging feeling of trying to predict what will happen next and what can we do to prevent it, which is in the base game. It's very quick so I could play it, but it's leaving my shelf.

I was very impressed with the game when I opened it and extremely aggravated when I lost 6 times in a row on the easiest setting. I experimented with the rules and after a few more plays I concluded the best way to play the game is to NOT remove dice when taking samples. This makes the game winnable on the easiest setting and progressively more difficult when you advance the infection rate marker at the beginning of the game. P.S. The game can still crush you even with this adjustment if enough dice rolls are against you.

A lot of dice versions of their bigger board game siblings feel somewhat lackluster. This isn't the case here:
Pros:
+ Very intelligent design that keeps a lot of the feel of Pandemic, but is still different.
+ Faster and more tactical than Pandemic with even more streamlined rules.
+ Due to the fact that each role has unique dice one seems to be able to use the special abilities more often than in Pandemic.
Cons:
- Having just six parts of the world that correspond to infection dice results instead of a world map makes it more abstract and less thematic.
- Obviously a lot more random than Pandemic. While re-rolls are a conscious decision, lots of biohazard symbols on the first roll can be very unlucky.
I'm still not totally sure if I prefer this one to the original Pandemic or not. Both have their advantages and disadvantages. For the time being I'm raking them the same.

RATING: 7
After seeing the gamenight  episode I had to had this.
perhaps because of the huge expectations it was a bit of a disappointment.

We couldn't press our luck as we rolled lots of biohazards in our first roll. a total of four dice were rerolled during the game.

We were very lucky in getting were we wanted and adding samples. Allthough the roles turnorder wasn't perfect for us we made it a priority to get all samples to me. I rolled succesfull with three dice on all occasions bar one but  we could buy a reroll at the cdc for one die. And were succesfull than.

I think pandemic the cure is a brilliant dice conversion and the alternative map works really well.

i would like to give this a couple of more runs. Most people seem to prefer this with three but I believe it might be best with four. If this is best with three I probably won't play ot with any other number. I hope that just like in pandemic adding a fourth player makes it more difficult.

Lighter and faster version of Pandemic. Definitely more random - hence the impression that it is not as tense as the original. Yet, with the random dice roll, it solves the alpha player problem to a certain degree.

Pandemic: the Cubes, or rather, Dice. A rather successful adaptation of the original mechanism. It has practically everything the original has and it’s the same hard to win – we failed miserably both times we played (just like during our first plays of Pandemic). If there is any problem with the game then it’s that after Forbidden Island and so on, it’s just another game with the same basic mechanism ideas which starts to be too many of the same. But for a Pandemic-based dice game it can’t really get better than this.

Good dice game that keeps the tension of outbreaks and spread of disease from Pandemic. Fun to calculate the probability of the wrong dice roll in the end. As tense as Pandemic, but since it is shorter the tension comes quickly and doesn't last as long. Needs an expansion since there are too few event cards.

This can be fun to play from time to time as a dice game but I'm uncertain how much decision making actually occurs in the game.  Sure, you can keep rolling your dice...at least until you roll infections.  I'd play again but I don't need to own it. I do like how each of the roles have different die faces and special powers to keep things a bit interesting.

To me, The Cure is almost equivalent to the original. The feel and tension are all there. It's a bit more abstracted, but it still plays essentially the same. 

The big change is the decision making. While all of the information is out in the original game, the dice make this one so much more dynamic. Decisions do not come as easily, and often they have a much higher price when you make the wrong one. I also like that since the board state changes so often there is much more discussion of strategy, and indeed more real decision space.

I REALLY like it. 

Update:

Same opinion after a dozen plays.

RATING: 8
Standard Pandemic has worn on me largely due to the nature of setup: arranging the player deck is fiddly, time-consuming, error-prone, and consequently neither easily passed off to others at the table nor talked over for teaching the game.

The Cure handily resolves all of this with a dice bag. Setup and game-state management are much simpler, and while gameplay isn't a precise map to Pandemic, it's very close.

The alpha-player tendencies of Pandemic aren't much reduced, though. Dice rolling means that someone can't concoct a definite three-player sequence of events, but that does nothing for planning the current player's turn by proxy. This is still a problem that has to be solved by the group rather than by the game.

Really fun. Decisions are not obvious and give you a lot to learn over several plays. At the same time the ruleset is simple, intuitive, and fits the theme very well. You begin to fear those virus dice.

The lose conditions feel weirdly unbalanced, in that when we lose it's almost always because of outbreaks.

I really like what they've done with this incarnation of Pandemic. The game is quick to set up, quick to play, and quick to tear down. Player turns are very fun... each player having unique dice, deciding how to use those dice, and re-rolling some of them - hoping to get the perfect turn. I agree with the reviewers who have said that it curtails the Alpha factor present in most co-ops.

I was worried about having buyer's remorse, but after playing it, no more.

RATING: 6
One game, on Intro, with a missed rule for the first few turns, does not a solid rating make.

I do know that I prefer the setup here to regular Pandemic, as its all but nonexistent. And the way the game implements the core of Pandemic, while bringing its own flair to the experience, is solid.

It feels slightly lighter than Pandemic overall, as reflected in its shorter play time. But I dig it! I knew it would be different, what with dice and luck and chance and all, and I like the ways in which it's different.

I can see this rising to an 8.

Rating based on solo play only.

Beyond the theme and basic gamesteps, this doesn't really play anything like regular Pandemic... the emphasis is on tactics over logistics, and the randomness of the dice causes more uncontrollable swings. I prefer regular Pandemic by a good margin, but this is a good simple, easy-flowing game with lots of dice to be rolled. I got this game to replace Elder Sign as my solo dice-roller, and it definitely suits me more as it is less fiddly and has more things to think about... and there are more dice!

------------------------------------
With further plays, I'm beginning to find this more frustrating due to the uncontrollable nature of the dice. You can mitigate a bit of the luck factor with good play, but in the end it's possible to have an outbreak with zero ability to stop it if you roll badly... and there's not even the sense of push-your-luck really, as even if you give up with one character, the next could easily send you over the brink on their first roll anyway as there's no "reset" between turns. Traded it away.

Fun and much quicker than the normal Pandemic.  Since it is a dice game it is quite luck heavy and outbreaks can get out of hand really quickly if you're not careful.

Before playing the game I was lukewarm as the game seems so abstract compared to normal Pandemic and I'm not a big fan of Leacocks previous dicegame (Roll through the Ages). Good reviews encouraged me to give it a chance and it's surprisingly good. Bit abstract, sure, but only takes 30 minutes to play and dice-based co-ops tend to be exciting, this one too. Compared to something like Elder Sign (which I like a lot) the streamlined rules are lovely. I recommend this to Pandemic fans who want to play different, more random and faster, version every now and then, but I don't recommend it as replacement for Pandemic (just buy Forbidden Island if you want lighter Pandemic). I'd love to see expansion for this.

With the addition of the [itemid=207107] expansion, this has become my go to 1 hour "filler". It never leaves my game bag. There is nothing about this game that - for me - doesn't work: I love all the roles, the events, the variants from the expansion. Perhaps the only flaw is the pretty terrible quality of the dice - some of which are definitely not cubes, you see this by eye!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Basically a shorter pandemic, with dice and some thematic compromises which make the game the poorer as a result (eg outbreaks only going clockwise).  Also, pandemic is a game that begs to be played on a map. There are some fun decisions, but the gameplay is very reactive to the dice which pop out.  Difficult to form longer term plans.

I already have pandemic, so can't see keeping this in my collection.  And if I want a dice based coop, then I've also got Space Hulk: Death Angel, which is much more thematic and has great tension.  I can see why this game is highly regarded, and it is solid, but I can't see myself getting much play out of it.

This is a fantastic incarnation of the Pandemic series. It is challenging, and thought-provoking. At any given time, players can be cruising along thinking everything is under contraol only to have things go very badly very quickly.

** Based on solo play only, with 2 roles **
Too random for me. I can play poorly and win, or play well (or at least better) and lose.
Reminds me why I don't like dice games very much.

Most of the decisions seem to be obvious, there is little motivation to re-roll a die unless you really need a specific action, and when that happens you just keep rolling it with a 50/50 chance of either getting what you want or rolling a bio-hazard.

I much, much, much prefer the board game version.

Still retains that Pandemic feel to it, but provides its own unique experience.  The dice can be cruel at times, but they also prevent the game from being quite as puzzle-y as regular Pandemic, as you can never count on getting any particular die face that you need.

Seems more difficult to win than regular pandemic. Don't forget to not only remove dice from the regions but also put them back in the bag otherwise all your efforts might be lost. At first plays it seems like the game is more luck based than the original but after a while you get better in it which doesn't make any sense if there is no strategy involved whatsoever. I think the game should be called a luck management game because luck does play a role but with strategical game play you could definitely lower luck and increase the win/loss ratio. Also I don't care about luck as much if the game is shorter - as this is in comparison to plain old pandemic. That's the reason why I loathe Robinson Crusoe because it has way too much luck for the playing time. A game that definitely grows on you and merits more than one game play. Also don't play it with 5, 2-3 players, max 4 works best.

This month just gone the GLOG hosted a fund raising event for Ebola. The idea was to play variations of the Pandemic franchise and donate a gold coin (one or two Australian dollars) to the collection jar per game. Quite a good idea and one that ended up raising around $250 for a very good cause.

After a couple of games of A Study in Emerald, Pandemic: The Cure (i.e. Pandemic the Dice Game) was just the ticket to finish off the gaming session. I played two games of Pandemic: The Cure and both ended up with the virus being defeated and the players triumphing.

Both games were enjoyable, but it seemed an ‘easier’ game than Pandemic itself so I am not sure about its replayability. Overall, I rate this game as one I might play again as a filler but one that I am unlikely to seek out and highly unlikely to purchase.

Better than the board game, surprisingly. Loses a lot of the thematic feel, but adds in the excitement of rolling dice. Luck is still a huge driving force to this system, but at least The Cure doesn't pretend to hide it behind a puzzle. Works really well as a cooperative filler game.

Yes, it's got a lot of randomness to it, but I think overall it balances out during play sessions. I've been playing two players (each of us take two roles) and we play in 30-40 minutes. So we can play a few times in a row in a reasonable amount of time. I think the game really needs to be approached as a group endeavor, not with each person making isolated independent decisions. There needs to be cooperation here, otherwise it won't work.

RATING: 7
It's a good dice conversion. You can still see the theme and the characters of the classic Pandemic, but completely altered to suit the new mechanisms. These mechanisms interact very well to offer many different options and ways to confront the issues. It also does a very good job at creating the tense feeling of the Pandemic board game, maybe even more, because even if you're doing very well, a bad roll can set you back.

I cannot say there the characters and the event cards are too few, but some more would have been welcomed.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (6):[/COLOR]

[i]I actually liked this game, but true to form co-ops tend to have a short shelf life in my house. After a flurry of plays when I first got it my kids quickly lost interest. Since my wife also doesn't like co-ops this was never getting to the table, especially since I didn't like it enough to try. I think a lot of people will love this game, Matt did a great job translating Pandemic into a challenging dice game. Co-ops just don't fly in my house.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]- Love the dice rolling, push your luck mechanic.
- The roles you get all feel different and exciting to play especially since you get custom dice.
- Plays great with 2, there is still plenty of tension in the game.
- Quick set up and play time especially when compared to Pandemic.[/i]

It's a really nice dice version of Pandemic, providing familiarity in theme and objective, as well as new touches to provide interest. The dice rolled at the end of your turn come in the 4 different disease colours, and after they're rolled, they're allocated to 6 different locations. Your job is to clean up those disease dice by rolling your character's unique set of dice, which will allow you to variously heal a disease die, collect a disease die, move between locations, do your character's special power (nice touch!) or, if you're unlucky, be forced to advance the epidemic marker up. Regions outbreak when there's more than 3 dice in a colour at a location, as youd' expect, and you can still lose by outbreaks. You can roll your dice as much as you like to get the results you want, but that of course runs the risk of rolling epidemics and accelerating the badness. The decisions you make within each turn on how to keep vs re-roll your dice are more interesting than Pandemic turns (which is generally more straight-forward re moves, clears, and cards) but the dice obviously make it more tactical and less strategic - it's much easier to organise meetups and sample swaps here than it is to organise card swaps in the main game. The loss of the map and location relevance also results in a loss of theme and epic-ness, leaving you with a more abstracted feel and less investment in the win. So it ranks a little lower for me than base Pandemic, but still a game I'd enjoy playing any time.

"Excellent dice version of Pandemic. Although I miss the map, this has surpassed Pandemic for me and my wife."

What I like:
- Solid mechanisms
- Probably more opportunities for actual cooperation than the board game
- Pretty components
- Plays in about an hour, even with some new players
- I love that it supports 5 players

What I don't like:
- Lack of a map and rolling 13 feel abstract
- A few mechanisms are counter-intuitive
- Can be a bit swingy
- Box is pointlessly large (but not painfully so)

I would put the weight around 2.1, just a bit lower than Pandemic the board game. It's comparable to Forbidden Desert in complexity, and FD is probably a bit deeper.

Based on one play: Takes the tested premise from Pandemic and modifies it to a dice version which actually works quite well. Each character has different dice that they role which have some standard sides and some specific to each character allowing for special powers. There is also an epidemic side on each that causes the threat level to increase. The viruses also spread through dice rolls and appear on one of six numbered cities. It is about as difficult as Pandemic is, we played on normal the first time and won, however we all known Pandemic quite well. We will have to play on heroic next time.

It's Pandemic, with dice. It's quick, although not THAT much quicker than Pandemic. A lot of randomness, but it is mitigated by being able to re-roll as much as you want until you use a die or it becomes a biohazard. I like it quite a bit, but I think it'll need the expansion fairly shortly after acquiring. I'm 3 plays in and I could see maybe getting 20 before shelving it for a while without the expansion. With it, I could see this coming out in a fairly frequent rotation as a good filler or opener for a night.

A good push-your-luck dice game, but a bit lacking in depth. The different player characters with their unique dice are cool, but the theme feels very abstract and hard to engage with.

For shorter games that's not as much of a problem, but this game feels large and long enough that there should be more dice mitigation.

Pandemic is a coop game wherein people with different roles travel the globe fighting off the spread of four different awful diseases, saving everyone from the titular pandemic(s). Using cards to move, and action points, you fight hard, and clear up outbreaks, and find cures.

However, in Pandemic: The Cure, you do all this using a fistful of dice, and so your abilities as your role and your luck dictate your role even more so.

Like an increasing proportion of coop games I have played, this game suffers from alpha committee, and a problem I call the 'contribution gap'. The contribution gap is the effect in a coop game wherein you are making full use of your turn, but you really don't feel engaged, usually as a result of what you're doing not feeling very important. Typically this is caused by one of two things:

A) Circumstance resulting in you just not being particularly useful (while the opposite is happening for at least one other player, who seems to be doing a lot more for the group, or is doing direct actions that will contribute to victory)

or

B) Everyone is contributing a little bit to the victory conditions, and while as a whole it is something, in pieces it is intrinsically lackluster.

In Pandemic: the Cure, I feel that it is a bit of both, but primarily A). B) on the face of it seems worse, but having encountered it in games like Shadows over Camelot (wherein you'll likely only do one or two quests in the entire game), I'd rather have it be intrinsic to game design, because at least then you can control it. In this game I was the 'Dispatcher' who apparently is some sort of helicopter pilot, and so could mobilize the others. Which is great, because we all needed to move to wherever we needed to be... but moving people is not super exciting in a game where you actual goal is to fight and cure diseases. Phipps was the Scientist, who can cure diseases easier, so her job became to be the designated disease curer... which makes her an awesome disease hero... but left me in the lurch, feeling more like a chauffeur in a game about fighting diseases. Blech. Oh well, at least I can agree with Raf that it's not even as good as Pandemic proper.

Clever push-your-luck Yatzee mechanic: you can roll dice as many times as you want, but if you roll an outbreak side, it happens and you can't roll that die any more.

Still, it's a co-op and I'm not a fan of them.

Is Pandemic lacking dice in your opinion?  Is it just taking to long to manage to play a game together for your group?  This game does most of the same things Pandemic does, but with dice rolling included, and it makes for a shorter game.

RATING: 6
The problem is, I don't love co-op games. They are okay sometimes. So take this into account when reading my review. There is a Yahtzee mechanic as well as other forms of dice rolling that make this one even more chaotic than Pandemic, the original. I'm sorry, but Pandemic is chaotic and hard enough for me. I don't need a co-op Yahtzee game myself. I do appreciate some things about it, and some people might like it better, but for me, I would happily play it if someone asked, but wouldn't even come close to requesting it, or buying it.

RATING: 8.5
Base Pandemic is my favorite game and The Cure provides the same theme and excitement with the entirely different push your luck, dice rolling mechanic. When you win a game of base Pandemic you feel smart and proud since you strategically "figured out the puzzle." You simply feel lucky when you win a game of The Cure. Because of this, I prefer the board game version over this dice game version. However, this is still a extremely fun game with great components that plays in half the time it take to play the board game. The fact that you can re-roll your character specific set of dice as many times as you want adds a pretty nerve racking element that I wouldn't normally find fun, but it works very well in The Cure.

Dice version of the classic.  This game is much easier to introduce to new players.  It's more streamlined, but offers a similar feel as the original game.  I think I prefer this to regular Pandemic.

Weakest part of the game (same as regular Pandemic):  The cover art.

Game is recommended.

My wife quite likes co-ops, even though I'm not too keen on them myself (I really like Robinson Crusoe, although not to play all the time, and Eldritch Horror can be fun in small doses, but every other co-op I've played other than this one I have found mediocre at best) - she usually plays them 2p with one of her friends (who doesn't live near us but visits a few times a year). They particularly love Pandemic, a game which I find really dull. Nevertheless, I was not averse to trying this new dice version of Pandemic with her, and while I don't think the game is anything special I actually quite enjoyed it. I've also since played it with 4, which didn't particularly change my opinion.

It's definitely much better than the game on which it is based - the dice keep it interesting, with each character having their own distribution of faces on the dice, an interesting push your luck mechanic whereby you can re-roll any of your dice any number of times but each die has one "bad" face which can't be re-rolled, and an interesting mechanic for curing diseases, which quite frequently leaves you needing to "lock up" several dice for a while without being able to use them for actions.

I think in the long run this is perhaps a little too luck based. It also feels quite easy - we won both games, the 4p pretty easily, and even though we were only one outbreak away from losing by the end of the 2p game things did feel under control, and this was with me playing the contingency planer who feels like one of the weakest roles (I think I only used his special ability once - although my wife having the generalist was compensation, you can't complain at 2 extra dice!). So I'm concerned that most losses will be due to bad luck rather than bad play.

So not really a game I'm ever going to miss if I can't play it again - but decent enough all the same.

I almost feel obligated to add the caveat that I do adore Pandemic as a game here because Pandemic: The Cure REALLY feels like Pandemic with awesome dice and quicker play time.  The decisions are still there for the making and the tension of discovering cures in time are also present but you can certainly still fall prey to horrible dice rolls.  But what's the big deal?  It only took you 10 minutes to lose, just pick up the dice and try again!

#64 on my Top 100 Games of All Time (2015)

This is fairly different than Pandemic. And I like it. It still has the same character roles, which do similar things. And you're trying to find a cure for the 4 diseases. But the way in which you do that is quite different as it's basically just a dice game. Quite fun. I will say that it has felt a bit too easy, but it has an easy built-in mechanic to keep increasing the difficulty.

Picked this up because it sounded like it would be a lot more interesting to us than the original Pandemic (less puzzley). So far we are enjoying it a lot, although Michelle prefers Flash Point. She doesn't like how your available actions are random and prefers the the mix of definiteness and randomness in Flash Point better. She still enjoys it, though.  

There is a large jump in difficulty between standard an heroic. And also, it can be really frustrating if you get stuck in a rut with crap rolls, but that's to be expected.

Pandemic with dice. It has a similar feel but it emphasizes a bit more luck than strategy versus the board game. Still it's fun, the difficulty is comparable, and it sets up and plays a little quicker. Having said that, I would still gravitate towards the board game since it adds a greater level of strategy...even my "strategy" still only accounts for an approximate 25% win percentage.

Another variation on my favorite game, Pandemic: The Cure is essentially the dice version of its predecessor. It does a really good job of mirroring the Pandemic experience and it does play quickly, about half the time of the board game. It's also pretty difficult, but that has more to do with the randomness of rolling dice than anything else. And that's what brings this game down for me. It can be so swingy, and while there are ways to mitigate some bad rolls, a few in succession will absolutely wreck your game. It's short enough that it isn't a deal breaker, but at the end of the day, I'd rather just play Pandemic.

So far this seems really fun. It feels different enough from the original but still has a lot of the same tension and plays a bit faster. Rolling dice is fun and the roles feel a lot more unique in this version. It is pretty random though and luck plays a lot more of a part in this than regular Pandemic and it can be frustrating. I also miss the way outbreaks branches in the base game. I might be missing something but this seems significantly more difficult than the base game? (We have yet to win). Production is fantastic though, lots of unique dice and great components.

A dice-based version of Pandemic.  It maintains the basic concept of the original game (collect samples, prevent outbreaks, roles with specific powers, etc), in a smaller and slightly faster presentation.

I don't get the same sense of puzzle solving and strategy that I do with the original Pandemic, this game feels like you just roll a bunch of dice and see what happens.  Depending on how the dice roll, this game can be incredibly easy, or incredibly hard, and I have a feeling a lot of people could get frustrated by this.

Ultimately, it's an OK game, but I'd rather just spend the extra 15-30 minutes playing a game of the original Pandemic, and there are other dice games I'd probably want to play over this one.

Also, the box size is unnecessarily large, they probably could have packaged this more compactly and marketed it as a "travel" version of Pandemic.

It seems to have more tension than ordinary Pandemic. I really like the dice and having some options at times to choose to re-roll them. It seems like it's a bit easier to collaborate in this one, as you're never that far apart so I felt much more like we were a team in this. A must have for Pandemic fans, and for those just lukewarm on the original, worth a look.

the components of this game are really excellent. the character cards are cut out to look like ID badges and the treatment center is a nifty plastic donut with little plastic syringes that count outbreaks and infections. i really like the way this game is laid out and put together. i'm not sure it adds anything beyond the original, however. 

what i like best about the original is: 
a) the tension 
b) very easy to teach and play, especially newbies and non-gamers 
c) not *too* easy to win or a "gimme". 

in comparison to The Cure/dice game: 
a) good tension, not *quite* as tense 
b) fail! not easy to teach or remember the rules 
c) very (very, very!!) hard to win. i keep reading posts where people report that the game is easy to win but i just don't see how that is possible mathematically! they must be extremely good dice rollers and i suggest they give up their day job and become a full time craps player. i like to play pandemic with my non-gamer friends and family. i had hoped to introduce this dice version to them as well but it isn't very encouraging for them when the whole world is taken over by disease after only 10 minutes.

There are reasonably interesting choices to be made, and I admire the simplicity of the design, even if there is a lot of luck involved. But no matter how good it is at what it does, it's a cooperative dice game. I'm probably never going to love those.

Good fun, fairly quick. Nice port of the Pandemic idea over to a dice game. I like the way each role has unique dice that change the statistics for each action and potentially add unique actions for the role. Maybe it's just that it's new, but I am enjoying this more than regular Pandemic right now.

RATING: 8
Dice games usually don't get me, dice rolling usually feels really random and I feel like the game looses a lot. And I love Pandemic and I've played it a ton of times (500+). But this game surprised me. After 6 plays I don't feel like the game lacks from the board game. It's certainly different, keeps you on your toes reacting on current situation, whereas in Pandemic you usually think ahead and change your plans only slightly based on what comes.

That being said, I usually like the more thinky game, but this game gives me the oportunity to still think about what to do and keeps the game portable, quick to set up and quick to play.

I was affraid about the luck, because all you do in the game is esencially rolling dice and rolling some more dice and occationaly rolling even more dice. That sounded bad. But you roll the dice all the time, means the luck mitigates itself, statistics come into play. If you roll 1 die to decide some outcome in the game, that's random. If you roll 10 dice during your turn (player dice and infection dice), you have better odds. With the whole game, you get a statistically significant number of rolls and they tend to really even out. In those games I felt just a bit more luck than in Pandemic. 

I've had a game where I rolled 4/5 dice biohazards and lost the game. I've had a game in regular Pandemic where there was one city that could kill us (one die from explosion connected to a city with 3 cubes) and we got that and it killed us. I've had a game where I couldn't roll a cure with 5 sample dice in 3 turns. I played Pandemic games where we had 3 cures and we just didn't get enough cards from last color, because they were at the bottom of the deck and we lost. There is randomness in both games, just a different one.

And since I'm mostly a solo gamer, this is big thumbs up. All you manage are dice, no tablespace required, you can manage it easily single-player even while playing 5 characters.

Also I'm confident I can teach this to my parents who don't play games except of Carcassone. The rules are simple, the only thing I'm affraid is the difficulty.

So far, so good with this Pandemic game.  I had thought it would be derivative, but the game play is different enough that it allows this lighter, faster version of the game to stand (proudly) on its own two feet.

Very much like it.  We'll see how much replay value it has!

RATING: 8
I am usually weary of dice versions of games.  Pandemic is already pretty simple for a cooperative game and the idea of making it simpler by turning it into all dice rolls definitely didn't intrigue me.

But this doesn't really feel simplified to me, it feels different but the same all at the same time.  In this each player has a role and a specific set of custom dice, which is really cool.  On their turn they roll these dice to do actions.  They can roll as much as they want but each roll has a 1-in-6 chance of increasing the infection level (and locking that die).  Then the virus phase is represented by rolling colored dice and spreading them out over 6 coasters representing different regions.  There are so many similarities to Pandemic but it really does feel like I'm playing a different game, it is so hard to explain.

The typical pitfalls of dice-rolling games are here, mainly luck.  But with the ability to re-roll as many times as you like and the strong strategic elements of what order you take actions, different special abilities, etc. definitely makes this not feel like a luck fest.

Also, the components are excellent.  Everything is colorful and slick and feels solid and good quality.  It also sets up, teaches, and plays a lot faster than Pandemic so it could certainly fit in a filler game slot.

It felt a bit to random for my taste. It seems like a really good choise for anyone who would enjoy a Pandemic like experience, but wants it to last for no more than 30 mins (and doesn't mind the increased randomnes). For me I would rather play any other Pandemic version.

Though don't get me wrong - your choises with the roll you get matter a lot, so there is skill here, but sometimes your dice will make you skip a turn or similar and you can't really do anything about it, which turned me off.

Compared to Pandemic this game is quick and mean. I find that after the first play in a group people are better equipped to make the choice they would like and are less effected by the alpha gamer because they hold the dice. Even though the map doesn't have the same sprawl when the dice start to pile up you get a similar feeling of dread.

Dice version of Pandemic. Each role has a different set of dice with different faces; each "disease" has dice with different number distributions, so black plague dice are more likely to land in region #3 etc.

It's a clever adaptation, but it seems to me to be a lot more random than card-Pandemic, with fewer opportunities for mitigation, and the loss of the map board really hurts the theme. Good for what it is but I just don't see the point.

I'll call this "Pandemic: The Playable". I know that pandemic is a much loved game by many, but I'm not one of them. This game is much better.

so if you noticed that all dice games hate you, be warned, because you will lose all the time

Excellent game. Fast paced and fun, combining much of the challenge of Pandemic with the excitement of a die-rolling game. Simple to play, but the luck element can be extreme; good or bad luck rolls are quite decisive. A good roll on putting out infection dice not only means fewer infections, but gives you resources to trigger special cards. A bad roll on your action dice not only advances the infection track but costs you actions.

A fun game which is hard to beat. I seem to be pretty unlucky and rolling at least 2 biohazards on each dice throws.

I have played about 10 games so far and it was great, providing lots of tension. But it does get to feel samey after a while. There is not a lot of diveristy in this game, with only 6 possible locations and not many cards.

I also don't like the fact the you can predict some of what will happen. Since there is only 12 dices of each color, you can tell which color is most likely to appear next.

The game is fun for now, difficult and quick enough to play a few games in a row. But I think it will get old fast.

I just bought this game at Essen and it went straight up to my top 5 games. I love this game! Allthough this can be a first hype offcourse....so ma scoring might go down after a while (or even up...who knows). For a long time I dind't want to play Pandemic untill someone convinced me to atleast give it a try. And I loved it....I have been doubting to get it in my collection but I found it a bit to hard to play with my family....and than this lighter version dice game was announced and I was very curious about it. And it didn't let me down.....it has the same great theme (maube a bit less because you don't have the world on a map) as it's bigger brother....it gives you the same stressed feeling about saving the world. Only the games looks so much nicer, playes easier and shorter and so I can play this with my family and they love it!

Aranyos kis kockás adaptációja a Pandemic-nek. Itt nincs térkép, hanem egy körben vannak a városok, amelyek között óramutató járásának irányába terjednek a betegségek amikor kitörés történik. A többi Pandemic-es mechanizmusnak is mind megvan a megfelelője.

Györgyinek tetszettek a szép színes kockák, és azt mondta, hogy ez jobban tetszik neki mint az eredeti Pandemic.

Én személy szerint nem igazán szeretem a kockás játékokat, de mitagadás, ez kicsit rövidebb és könnyedebb mint az eredeti.

I definitely like this one better than its predecessor. The die-rolling keeps the game from feeling determined from the beginning. In addition, it feels more like an actually cooperative game rather than being a bunch of puzzle pieces getting shuffled around. This is due to 1) the use of CDC points (don't know what they're officially called) to buy events, and 2) the map consisting of only six locations, with a free handoff at end-of-turn, makes passing resources much easier. Also the component quality is great.

Still, I anticipate I will tire of it in another game or three.

(Edit: Aaaaand there we go.)

This is my favorite game of the year--2014. 
Pros:  Quick set-up, intuitive, lots of dice rolling (yet lots of choices and reduced luck), plays solo, wife loves it due to theme, plays with group up to five, simple rules, fast playing (15 minutes solo, 20 for couple, 30 for group), variable play levels, components are nice quality and comes with fabric bag, and, at times, very difficult to beat.

Cons:  No world board, box is larger than needed (probably for marketing only), dice are translucent (in large batches it's sometimes difficult to see various numbers quickly).

What a great game!

:thumbsdown: The gameplay left us cold. Decisions didn't impress me as interesting, they seemed to be very simple. Mostly you just roll, see what the roll allows you to do, and then re-roll to try and get a better result. Games like this made me learn that I just find nothing enjoyable in the Yahtzee mechanic. I greatly prefer the puzzle of dice allocation and manipulation in games like [thing=132531][/thing] or [thing=169426][/thing].

Rating after one play at Essen: 
Feels similar to the boardgame which is good and adds the randomness of dice which is not so good. Although it may be a bit more realistic to bet your virus samples on a research roll and get a cure or not, I like the mechanic of the board game better where you just spend cards and get the cure with certainty.

The Cure is a fun take on the traditional Pandemic formula. It's easy enough to teach if everyone knows the board game but plays differently enough to make it worth a try.

The custom dice are great and the mix of player powers and events (which are used much more often than in the board game) lead to the players talking through the puzzle early and often.

I'm not sure there's much replayability here, but only time will tell.

Pandemic: The Cure is part of the latest craze of taking a board game and making a dice version of it. I enjoy Pandemic and was really curious about how this game fills out the Pandemic series.

When you sit down to play this, you'll instantly recognize that you're playing Pandemic. The graphics, roles and abilities, and even a lot of game mechanics are very very similar to the original game. There's roles with special powers that are very close to the original... even down to player colors matching the role name from the original, outbreaks that work much the same, similar special event cards, and even the process for curing diseases is reminiscent of the original.

Instead of cards with city names where you place cubes, you have dice that you roll to determine a location where the die will go. Outbreaks still occur when you have more than three of a color in a location.

You don't get to choose your actions at will. Instead you have to roll for them. You can keep rolling until you get what you want... unless you roll a biohazard symbol, which puts you closer to the next epidemic. Also, when you collect dice of a particular color to try and cure a disease, you have to roll those dice and get a total of 13 or above to find a cure. So a poor roll means you have to wait a turn to try again... painful as every die that you collect requires a player's die to hold it, and that ties that die up meaning that player's have fewer actions.

So the main difference between this game and the original is luck. Or rather the type of luck. Whereas in the original the random card draw and infection cards were the main type of luck, in this version the luck you're up against is die rolls. So you can get screwed trying to get the actions you want for the turn, rolling for a cure and of course determining the location to place dice in an infection or epidemic. I think that's a bit more luck than in the original, but then again some things are a little easier than the original... like moving around the board (and by association trading cards/dice as they can only be done in the same location). So while some aspects of the game are a little easier, the game seems to balance that by introducing more areas where you need to roll the right dice.

So is there too much luck? Did they find the right balance? Well, let me start off by saying that the original game had a lot of luck too. You can, and often did, get screwed by luck. The game was trying to manage the unmanagable as best you could. And losing horribly was often just as fun as winning. And winning was more of an accomplishment.

So I'm actually okay that there's a huge dose of luck in this game. It's largely the same experience, trying to do the best you can given that the universe and fate are against you. This version plays a lot quicker as well, so losing isn't quite as painful, as you've invested a lot less time.

That being said, I wonder if it's a tad too much luck dependent. The game seems to be very difficult to beat. I only played twice, but the owner of the games has only won once in about a dozen plays. It seems as though you need to get very good rolls to have a chance of winning. I'd like to try the game a few more times before coming to a conclusion on that... but even if it ends up being a little on the luck side, it's still a fun game that would fit on the lighter filler side of things.

The game? oh yeah, it's brilliant. Did I mention we met Matt Leacock?

Seriously, this dice-driven version of Pandemic offers yet another 'stand on its own 2 feet' variant to the main game. This offers new mechanics, new strategies and new challenges, all whilst retaining a comfortable familiarity from the game you know and love. This is no simple condensation of the game to a dice roller, it genuinely adds a different dimension to the game and manages to preserve that genuine sense of peril you get from its big cousin. Due out Essen 14.

What’s the point. Pandemic without the board. Super thematic.

RATING: 8
Very good game.  Easy to teach to others.  Quick 30 minute play time.  The cooperative game play is good for your harmonious friends.  Not very deep strategically -- a player basically needs to respond to his die rolls.

I've never played the original Pandemic.  I chose to purchase this edition for its ability to travel, and it works well for that.  Note however that you need a large die rolling area -- you roll up to a dozen dice at a time.

Solo play works fine for this game, just play as many roles as you desire.

Definitely a different beast than Pandemic -- it is quite swingy. Retains the feel of Pandemic -- never comfortable, board can explode -- my fiancé likes it more than Pandemic base! I'm intrigued because it's different, but I dunno if it fixes my complaints about dice games generally (namely said wild swings of luck)

Pandemic with dice rolling!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is a great standalone game that works completely independently from Pandemic. It definitely feels more like rolling dice than curing diseases, but I still find it engaging. It won't replace the original, and it doesn't need to do so. Pandemic: The Cure is easy to learn, and it plays in 20-30 minutes.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
I love the original and this is as good if not better.  Streamlined play with almost no set up time.  The push your luck and always available events add more decisions.  The best part, though, is the role dice.  Every role has it's own unique dice.  These dice guide your play by making your character better at certain tasks.  I love how thematic this makes each role.  In the original game you might choose not to use your power (or forget to).  In this version you can't help but follow your abilities.  BGG Secret Santa 2014.  Thanks Santa!

RATING: 7
Prefer this one over the base Pandemic.  Movement around the "board" is smoother and feels less fiddly.  The base game is so spread out it's difficult to play with only 2-3 players because you can never get where you need to be fast enough.  This one plays well with any number of people, including a "schizolo" play with 1p controlling 2 characters.

This one scales in difficulty depending on where you start out on the infection rate and outbreak tracks.  There's still some stress involved on the easier settings, but once you master that it can become increasingly difficult to beat on harder settings.

Overall, everything pulls together really well in this version of the game.  The dice don't feel any more luck-based than the cards did.  Small footprint makes this easy to take to work or when traveling.  It's easier to teach to new players and seems to be easier for them to get into playing.

I have mixed feelings currently about this version of Pandemic, we really enjoy the strategy involved in REGULAR Pandemic, and this takes a lot of that away. It is not terrible, and I will want to play it on a harder difficulty to really determine how I feel about it.

Very good co-op. Still undecided if it is better or worse than the original pandemic. Compared to the original it is more random and less of a math excercise, but on the other hand it also means less predictability and overall feels it may be too dicey. So far I'm leaning toward the original with expansion.

A fun dice chucker.  But, every time I play this I think I'd rather just play Pandemic.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
It's a better game than Pandemic, but it loses a lot of its charm and simplicity.  This is not nearly as intuitive for new users to pick up.  The dice both serve to further differentiate the roles, and to make the outbreak management just a little bit more interesting, but they really make new gamers' heads spin.  The hook in the original Pandemic is seeing the disease spread around the world, and that's missing from this version, where the world is boiled down to an abstract representation of a few discs.

There's a place for this in the Pandemic fan's collection, but I would not think of this as a replacement.  It's more of a next step when people are getting tired of the less streamlined, more frustrating hand management of the base game. For people who don't own the base game, I wouldn't bother with this one, as the mechanics only make sense in the context of the other version.

I like dice, but man, am I over the cooperative game fad.  I like Pandemic well enough for what it did, and how it was designed, but playing it with dominating players sort of killed it for me.  Also, cooperative games have more of a puzzle-like feel than a game feel to me, and they don't feel as satisfying when you pull off a win.  The Cure doesn't really change much of what I dislike about the genre, but it has some neat mechanisms.

Had several copies at work, used for teaching a class on world health issues. Fun game, a little complex to teach due to different roles (a teachers' supplement/expansion would be nice). Game typically gets played a few times a month with colleagues.

The components leave a bit to be desired. The colour in the pawns is dull and can be hard to tell apart, the world coasters are pretty boring visually, and the tracker ring feels way overdone. It would have been better to spend this money on quality dice. Many are missing pips or are misshapen. The pawns could use more contrast (especially when the dice and other components are so brightly coloured)

You can feel some of the flavor of Pandemic when playing Pandemic: The Cure. You're not sure what's going to show up and you have to deal with it as it does, but it does feel like the dice show up far faster than the cubes do in Pandemic, but there is a 1 in 6 chance of it being beneficial, so there is that. I like that there are unique player powers and that everyone has some special ability. I think my only problem with this is the randomness and the inability to plan, but I still enjoy it.

This is a decently portable version of Pandemic that maintains the essence of the game while adding intriguing new gameplay elements. The components are great.

Lighter more random press-your-luck version of Pandemic. Cleverly designed as you would expect from the designer. Race to find the four cures before reaching one of the three game end timer conditions. Would still rather play the regular game even though I like dice. With four players it doesn't seem challenging, still light fun. With three players our success ratio is poor?

I LOVE the custom dice in this game and I cannot wait to buy the expansion Experimental Meds. This a perfect coop with minimal setup. The dice in this game make the game more challenging because you can get a few REALLY bad rolls and be done for. However, there is nothing more fun than being able to re-roll your dice as many times as you want trying to avoid the bio-hazard symbol.

Definitely a more tactical game than the original, I almost find it more thematic and definitely prefer the pacing of this to normal pandemic. 

My only wish was that it would eventually get an expansion (which seems very unlikely at this point)

Edit: Got an expansion, the new roles are fantastic! Remains my favorite implementation of pandemic.

7 after 1 play.

Dice rolling makes the gameplay different enough from Pandemic. However, it doesn't bring out the theme to the same extent, primarily because of the lack of a map and more abstract feel. The game may gain from using a completely different theme to differentiate it from Pandemic.

Since the infection rate is largely luck-driven, this may not appeal to eurogamers as much.

Game is prone to quarterbacking. Setup is a bit long for a fast dice game. It's hard not to like all the specialized dice and feels thematic with some great moments--Oops, I dropped all the samples when I was trying to bottle them; so sorry to have caused an epidemic!

Terrible colorblind issues with the translucent red/black dice and similarly colored pawns that gets worse adding the experimental meds expansion. We stack the same colored dice into pyramids, making it obvious where outbreaks may occur. Only 6 locations so colorblind player usually remembers where pawn is currently. Game is playable as long as somebody can see the colors.

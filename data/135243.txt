I first heard about this game on Kickstarter in early 2013, and it was my first (and as of this writing, my only) game I ever kickstarted. I'm a dinosaur nut, what can I say?

All of the plastic dinosaurs give off an Ameritrash vibe, but underneath is a very meaty, "Euro" area control game that lasts about an hour but not much longer than that. Luck does not play a part in the outcome, only decisions between players. Also, for a Euro it has fantastic player interaction (it's probably one of the most interactive board games I own). No time for multiplayer solitaire when your herds can be eaten at any moment or assimilated into another player's herd! Better pay attention.

Every time I play this, which is not often enough, I am reminded again how much I like it and wish it hit the table more often. I think this is one of the most underrated games that I own.

(Ha, just remembered meeting Peter Hawes, the game designer, at BGG.CON 2013 and my buddy and I singing to him our stupid fake Saturday morning kids TV commercial song for Triassic Terror. "Triiiiiiasic Terror! Area control! Dinosaurs... killing other dinosaurssssss!" He was not really amused.)

Terry bought this at BGG Con and got the designer to sign it.

We greatly enjoyed it, and can't wait to introduce it at a game day.

Finally got it back to the table at September game day, and this thing is really great, some delicious brain burning action where you can mess with each other, but if you do it too much, you'll watch someone else pass you up. Great area majority game!

Quiet a good simple and clean rules game. 

An area occupation game with a twist on the map areas and using various methods to add or remove dinos. 

The plastic dinos are ok. Not exactly fantastic and do they add any flavour in my opinion. 

Overall a reasonably quick game, especially good for 4 players that don't need too heavy a game.

It comes with small toy dinosaurs! Dinosaur theme is fun, gameplay is quick, not very much down time between turns. You can win the game using different styles: add/spread your population or chomp down on your opponents with the T-Rex, raptors or pterodactyl... yummy! I've played this a few times and it's still different every time because the choices of 6 actions is shared between all players, so you only get to choose from actions that opponents ahead of you left.

Feels very much like Dominant Species on a diet, with plastic dinosaurs. This is a good thing. Whilst I admire DS's thoroughness, the sheer length and complexity is kind of off-putting for what it is. TT manages to distil many of the key ideas into a breezier package, and that makes it a-ok in my book. Plus, it is smart enough to include plastic dinosaurs in a game about dinosaurs, which is a must really.

2013. 6p. area majority, role selection = turn order selection, w/PR style incentivizing. sounds okay but I'm not a huge fan of the area majority genre. many others in my game group that like El Grande, etc. would probably like the "take that" and fairly wide open attacking nature of the game. BGG user heccubus has a GameNight video that explains the game in ~20 min.

Great fun! Feels like Dominant Species lite. Or a non-offensive Tomorrow. Which is actually a compliment - almost no luck, no multiple action selection pawns, and... tahdah!!! it has cute, cuddly, colorful dinosaurs! 
Very streamlined, easy to "get" the rules, yet a lot of variety & depth despite the fixed board & 6 staple actions. And did I mention cute dinosaurs? Darwinism in motion!

It plays a bit long for how much 'take that' is baked into the mechanics.  How the game plays differently for the number of players is also a bit wonky, different bonus scoring in different rounds based on number of players but its not printed on the board anywhere.  It also seems to suffer from the 'bash the points leader' and the guy left alone the whole game will probably win problem.  Also, there are kingmaking issues in the final scoring.  I think the game would be greatly enhanced by hidden scoring.

I played this one at CanCon through a demo from the game designer (Peter). I have rated it 9 based on my first impression from one play, as this game really surprised me in terms of how much I enjoyed it.

Unlike other area control games I have played, the game uses a variable order/role mechanic which adds significant depth of strategy to the game. It also has a healthy dose of direct player interaction (i.e. take the T-rex or raptors role and destroy your opponents, or migrate your dinos through their existing herds). 

I also really liked the theme, and it was well executed with nice components.  

Want to play this one again.

Pretty bad. And I'm not even talking about the hideous art throughout. There's just not enough interesting game state. It's just a bunch of dinos on the board, in zillions of different scoring positions for majority control. You take turns picking form a limited set of actions, but it basically boils down to adding dinos, moving dinos, and/or killing others' dinos. Evo is like 100x better at doing this with things like changing weather, and evolving dinos.

I'm trying to get past the fact that the dinosaurs on the cover are not from the Triassic period.  Since the reviews are good I should give it a shot but my paleontological purism is kicking me in the backside.  The game should be called "Cretaceous Carnage".  (With a smattering of late Jurassic, but I can't think of a good J word to go with it)

Fun area control with the added bonus of playing with lots of colorful dinosaur pieces, particularly the bigger plastic ones that look like old Imperial or Marx molds, complete with outdated postures and anatomy. Dinosaur lovers will likely be smitten immediately.

RATING: 8
Honestly a 7, but I gave it an extra point for dinosaurs!

Ultimately, this is a fantastic, abstract area control game (one of my fave types) that actually feels thematic.  Whaat?  While this is pretty much Euro through and through, the action selection and implementation all plays thematically with what you're doing on the board.  Does it make narrative sense?  Nope.  But still, you get to move dollar-store dinosaurs around coupled with some nifty dino meeples.  What are you doing reading this?  Go get it already!

I find the tension in this game can be quite good given that turn order and action selection both play into the events of a particular turn.  Sure, you can secure your position, but do it too early and someone will knock you down a peg.  Do it too late and you'll be playing catch-up all night.  It's as much about playing the table as much as it is playing the game, and that's what I definitely like most about Triassic Terror.

Also, it has dinosaurs.

RATING: 8.25
This is a solid and thematic area-control, direct-conflict game set in the world of DINOSAURS!  There is very little luck involved, as there are only 3 times in the game when you may choose to draw blindly from a deck of cards.  The rest of the game is filled with plenty of decisions between moving your dinosaur herds, growing them, or devouring other players' herds with the T-Rex, Raptors, or Pterodactyl.  

I can see how the dinosaur theme may be off-putting to some of the "serious" gamers out there.  However, for the rest of us who grew up playing with plastic dinosaurs making roaring sounds, you'll find yourself doing the same at times while enjoying the heck out of this gem.  One potential drawback is the length of the game.  Even with our group of 3, the game usually runs over 2 hours.  Still highly recommended.

DINOSAURS!! This is not the best game I have ever played by any stretch of the imagination, but it is a solid and well-designed game and it has dinosaurs. The components are especially unbelievable, though I wish they had gotten an expert opinion on a couple of the dinos they chose to include. The little pink guy, particularly, does not look like any dinosaur I ever heard of, and I am somewhat an expert. LOL! Nonetheless, a fun, family strategy game.

Egy tipikus area influence, ami még a stíluson belül is igen nagy kitolási faktorral van megáldva. Mint minden ilyen játékban itt is komoly problémát jelent a királycsinálás lehetősége. Mindezeket figyelembe véve csak gyakorlott, hasonló szinten lévő, nem sértődős társaságnak ajánlott. Viszont nekik nagyon, mert aránylag egyszerű szabályokból, de egy nagyon jól összerakott játékról van szó. Az akcióválasztás mechanizmus nagyon jó, és maguk az akciók iszonyat jól ki vannak egyensúlyozva. Ha a játék egyes szakaszaiban valami erősebb lenne, akkor a bónusz dínó, és az utoljára jövés lehetőség nagyon jól kompenzál.

After initial play, I do like it.  The game is actually more aesthetically pleasing than it has a right to be, and the game mechanics are interesting.  A take that worker placement, but because it has dinosaurs, your happy to eat and be eaten.  Slightly concerned that turn order has an influence, but would like to try again. Solid 7 (Nov 2014). UPDATE: Increase rating to 8 after four player game, as It's even better than 5, and I don't sense the selection of the first player is as important.  Excellent mechanism with turn order changing the card action *rating 8). UPDATE Need to rediscover this (Rating 8.132 Jan 17)

Relatively simple area majority game with action selection mechanics. Does nothing new with these ideas, however. Nice presentation. Love dinosaur themes as always! However, many mechanics just don't connect fluidly to the theme. Makes for a somewhat Euro abstract game out of a themey Ameritrash component game. As it is rather tactical and bashing, there isn't much to think about while you wait for your turn, as the board can change up a lot by then.

I don't like area majority games, and I especially don't like area majority games where you can get stuck in a pissing war or people just destroy your stuff. This game doesn't have so much of the pissing war problem, but it definitely has a fricking tyrannosaurus rex taking your stuff. MY stuff. MY babies! So this is definitely not my sort of game. On the other hand it works well, and was definitely more fun than El Grande, which inspired it.

An awesome dinosaur game - a really neat form of area control combined with a great action selection mechanism where players have to carefully balance which action they want to take against what place they want to have in the turn order each turn. The production quality is absolutely amazing here, as well (although I do wonder why all the dinosaurs have figures except for the pterodactyl which just has a marker).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
The game seems to have been heavily inspired by "El Grande". You compete for area majorities by selecting from an array of actions that allow you to add, move or eliminate player pieces. I like the fixed set of actions and the use of "habitats" (circles inside areas) to instantly visualize majorities and break ties. It still has the familiar feeling of chaos management and works fairly well, but turn order for action selection may be too important in the scoring rounds, more so with more players, and there is no way to influence that.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Absolutely a great game! Every detail of this game is wonderful, the wooden dinosaurs are a joy to play with. And the box even has a little recess to lift the board out. The artwork is fantastic and the built quality is much higher than i have come to accept in games. I immediately knew i was in for a top class game.

The game is fairly easy to teach to new players and we've had alot of fun swooping in with pterodactyls in our house now. we found in 3 player games the selection of actions leaned to far towards unused from the turn before leading to some predictable game play. this however is not an issue in the larger games. 

The bonus for scoring changes as the game progresses so you see a shift in players goals taking away repetitiveness from the game.  Instantly one of my favorite games. You get to eat opponents with dinosaurs how can that not be a great game
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Good, solid game. Excellent quality components. Lots of fun trying to outwit your opponents! So many different ways to gain dominance in an area. Yes some of your dinos will get eaten!
A word of caution though. This game does not play well with 5 or 6 players. Once one player gets down in the dino count he/she will get 'picked' on by default from which it is almost impossible to recover. With 5 or 6 players I would rate this game as a 5.5.

Liked this game when I first saw it.
Had the privelege of talking to game designer, Peter Hawes, at CanCon2013 who ran me through a quick summary of the game. A good balance of strategy and variable complexity ratings, so that it is playable by kids or adults or both. More evil than Evo, a must add to the stack of boardgames in the study. Havent given this a rating yet, as we need to play it first to get a good handle of the board mechanics.

While there is an enormous amount of appeal in the aesthetic of this game (dinos! Wooooo!!), the game itself really stands up on the gameplay. I enjoyed the delicate balancing act of trying to control areas with my herds to gain points at the end of each era, while working with the actions available to me each turn to try and strengthen my presence or get in there and nom down on my opponents herds with T-Rex, a pair of raptors or a pterodactyl! Strong stuff from Peter Hawes!

I tend to like area control games, and who doesn't like dinosaurs? There's a small game-snob voice in the back of my mind that says that this game doesn't do anything that El Grande does much better (except play 6!), but screw the game snobbery, this is a very fun game for those who don't mind direct confrontation and some chaos. Why more games haven't used plastic dinosaurs as components is beyond me. Wish the pterodactyl was plastic instead of a wooden disc. 

Update: After a second play, the rules still struck as a bit fiddly for such a seemingly straightforward game, I think the player aid could be much better, and the game really leaves me wanting to play El Grande. Still, with all the almost-no-interaction euros that come out these days, it's nice to see a solid design that emphasizes direct conflict. I've only played 6-player so far, and I wonder how it would be with 3 or 4 (with 5, gimme El Grande).

Expand your prehistoric herds across four environments in eight or nine rounds (based on number of players) using one of six actions available -- but watch out for predators like the T-Rex! Plenty of opportunities to thin out others herds at the expense of your own. It's easy to learn, fun to play, and -- most importantly -- how can you possibly fault a game that uses real plastic dinosaurs?

BIG PLUS: easy to learn, all ages, plenty of strategy and options, REAL plastic dinos!!

 Starting with just one herd in the swamp in Triassic Terror, players must establish new herds and grow them into larger herds, which will then migrate across the four pre-historic landscapes present, competing for the best habitats. This primaeval world is, however, full of danger. Players' dinosaurs will fall prey to the mighty T-Rex, marauding Velociraptors, and swooping Pterodactyls. Erupting volcanoes will devastate some areas and fill the skies with ash, making the affected area almost unlivable. The player who best avoids these terrors and maintains the largest herds across all four environments will win the game.

RATING: 7.5
An area control game that pits you against your opponents during three prehistoric periods of time.  A time when 'dinos' walked this Earth.  Whoever controls the balance of life over a certain amount of rounds of time will win the game.  The game is decided by who can get the most points via this area control.  The game does have a tendency to allow for 'king making' but ultimately who doesn't like playing with dinosaurs.  I would play this game again!

Very nice components in this game with little plastic dinosaurs.  It is a area control game where you move your herds of dinosaurs around the board and score points based on areas you occupy.  There is a T-Rex and other interesting dinosaurs that can eat your dinosaurs.  The components made this game, but the underlying game was not that exciting. I would probably give it a 5 if not for the cool dinosaurs.

Awesome plastic dino minis in an interesting area control game.  Plays ok with 2, but best with 4.  Artwork is...odd.  Board looks nice but the rest of a mismash of styles and sources.  Plays fairly well, but just not all that memorable.

Rules are simple, but the gameplay is deeper than I expected. No option is obviously the best option to take and there's much to consider. Interaction is also high (which I like) and The theme is definite plus in my case.

Played at Cancon 2013 and really enjoyed it. A cut throat area control game which is perfectly suited to its theme (as your T-Rex chomps down on your opponents' herbivores). 

The role selection mechanic and variable player order add a great deal of strategy which I haven't seen in an area control game before. The different options are simple enough to learn quickly, but it is the interaction between them that adds the depth (and plenty of ways to mess with opponents' plans).  

Would love to play it again soon.

Due to the level of *mean* game playing which happens during Triassic Terror (which I guess being it's dinosaurs, it fits the theme), I've given it a 6, as I will have to be in a fantastic mood to play it so as I don't flip the game table. I've heard of that sensation from other gamers, but never experienced it myself until playing Triassic Terror. I felt the ROOOOAAAAR within!!! lol I laugh now, but I was not a happy gamer on that day.

Kickstarter.
I also have the Limited Edition Predator Tiles.  These tiles are just alternative art and have no direct impact on play (can just play tile options on the standard tiles).

Wonderful components.  Pterosaur rubber figure I think is a bit large.  Dinosaur figures and meeples great for theme.

More importantly for me, the box, insert, insert cover and board makes this a box combination I'm considering saving, rather than bagging and binning all components like I do other games.

Though the standard 2 player rules are fine for learning the game, I personally think playing 2 colors and either adding score or playing for differences of 1st/2nd and 3rd/4th place (perferred) gives more of the full experience (competing for spaces).

I absolutely love this game! The scope for different strategies in each round is huge and you really have to think ahead and keep a close eye on what other players are doing when planning your own moves. Turn order also plays a pretty big part. As a huge fan of both dinosaurs and area control games I was incredibly excited when I first saw this game was on order (I manage a games store in Brisbane, Aus)and despite my fairly lofty expectations it didn't disappoint. Easily one of my outright favourites after game one. It would be all too easy for this game to have had great game play yet suffer in the build quality department, but no, Peter Hawes doesn't do bad quality! The design of this game, from the box art, to the board, the cards, the pieces and even the packaging, is just beautiful. I honestly can't speak highly enough of this game!

[b]Triassic Terror[/b] was received in a math trade (1/5/16).

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]How I wish I could get this to the table more. It is right up there with El Grande when thinking about my favorite area control games, for that matter any game (it's in my personal top 10).. My quick sell is imagine El Grande with hungry dinosaurs. Triassic Terror is more confrontational than El Grande since you can wipe out other people's herds of dinosaurs, but that's the point of area control right? I'm sad to say that my son really doesn't enjoy area control games and Triassic Terror shines with 4+ so I'm really trying to get this played with my local game group, but unfortunately it has been a tough sell.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (10):[/COLOR]

[i]- El Grande + Dinosaurs = a lot more carnage! (This game is not for the feint of heart).
- Amazing components, this game looks beautiful set up on the table.
- Excellent player aid makes this game easy to teach. 
- All of the above factors make this an excellent family game.

Even if you own El Grande I think there is room for both in your collection. Each turn you can choose from up to six different actions which makes it easier more crucial to plan ahead in Triassic Terror versus El Grande. In fact if you are not always one step ahead of your opponents it is easy to get smacked around by your opponents if you aren't paying attention to turn order and especially the majority bonus scoring at the end of the third age. There is a lot more I could say, but if you like area control games check this one out I was surprised how Peter was able to build on a lot of the ideas found in El Grande, make it more strategic and yet not complicate it with a bunch of extraneous rules. Awesome game and it'll be interesting to revisit this one and seeing how it stacks up against El Grande after playing it for a year.

As an aside Triassic Terror beats El Grande hands down when it comes to theme and components making it the better family game in my house. Once the game was set up on the table my kids couldn't wait to play.[/i]

Majority game with a lot of "negative actions" that are dimishing other peoples dinos instead of placing owns, resaulting in a very cutthroat gameplay, that is more tactical than strategic. Usually someone is screwed badly with no chance of recovery. 
Despite this flaws this is a decent game if you can stomach the unpredictability of your fellow players moves and the high extinction rate. The graphic is a bit dark, but the tokens and plastik dinosaurs are definitly increasing the fun factor.

This is a very straightforward role selection/area majority game. Each turn, players select a role that allows you to place some pieces in particular areas, and possibly move one of the carnivore pieces to remove pieces in particular areas. After each three rounds, players score for area majorities. Not much else to say about this one. It's like El Grande without many of the interesting parts.

I would have given this game a 4 after the first play, but having played with several different opponents now I must say that with the right group this game can be a lot of fun. Whilst I can't see myself taking this game off the shelf much, when other people (including non-gamers) see the title, box art and dinosaurs they want to play it and that is not a bad thing for the hobby.

RATING: 5
This game has some great components. Even the dinosaurs that are basically the cheap plastic things available at any discount store look good and are quite fun. The game is a simplistic area control exercise. I think the interesting part revolves around the action selection. In clockwise order, players choose a single action to take from among six available actions. Then, the actions are resolved in the order they are laid out on the board. This made for some tense decisions. While it's fun to eat opponents with a giant T-Rex, the randomness makes any long-term planning quite difficult. I'm not certain Triassic Terror will have a permanent home in my collection, but in the meantime, there should be 6-8 fun plays in it for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
If you like area control as a mechanism and you can take the fact that you can lose control because someone eats your dinos, then this is a great game for you. However, don't expect to find some refreshing new game mechanism from this game. But all works great together and the bonus is that the actions even feel thematic right; the theme for once is more then just a paste-on.

Played at Cancon, taught by the designer Peter.

Components and artwork are superb. Extra thick card stock. Vibrant images and dinomeeples plus actual dinosaur figurines.

Area control game with many direct player interaction.  Of the 6 actions a turn, 3 involve attacking other players herds with T-Rex, Pterodactyl or a pair of Raptors.

First play suggests substantial strategic depth for repeated plays. Waiting next game

This is a quick playing, aggressive area control game with lots of guy death and rubber toy dinosaurs that goes all the way up to 6 players. With 6 players, you only do 2/3rds of the turns you do in a 4 player game, so it still plays very quickly. The rulebook is terrible and the way the game works is as follows. Players in seating order choose their action for the turn. Then the actions are resolved in action tile stack order. This means that with 6 players, you don't really get any choices in terms of what you want to do on your turn more than twice per game.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This game feels so 1995! It's area control crossed with worker placement with barely any frills! Your typical Eurogame nowadays is bloated with lots of special action cards to cater to recovering Magic: The Gathering addicts. This game is quite streamlined compared to what's coming out now.

Another design feature that's so late 80s: Pieces that move from space to space! One "flaw" would be that some actions are simply more interesting to do than others. There's one action that enables you to add units on the board. That's boring compared to the migration action, which enables to you move a herd of your pieces and steal units from your opponent when you do that! This is something of a rarity in area majority games: the ability to take units away from your opponents!

That said, this game will drag with AP-prone players. Any game with movement will do that to players. Also, despite the cool dinosaur miniatures, those who are hoping for some kind of evolution mechanic (like Evo or Wildlife) are out-of-luck here: this could have been another El Grande.

Personally, I'm not a fan of Euros in general; Triassic Terror not a kind of game I'd be willing to play again. But those who are nostalgic for mechanisms that attack the leader should consider trying this game.

Became a fan of Peter Hawes after Wars of the Roses. Seems he has started his own publishing company, Kayal Games, whose aim is to produce high quality strategy games.

Played at the games release at Cancon 2013. This is a very, very good game which impressed our table with its depth of strategy, versatile play and clever action tile selection which can change the order of play. You may be first to choose an action tile (these are numbered one to six), but the play of these tiles is in number order, so your choice is influenced by whether you need to go before another player or after him. This decision can also turn on what tile that player chose.

This game integrates the game art, mechanics and theme very well. When a player takes the T-Rex or Raptors you hold your breath and hope they aren't coming your way.

Very realistic art on the box, board and cards. High quality components and clever thinking strategy game makes it a winner for me. Well done to Kayal Games on its first production.

RATING: 9
Area control/majority game in which you try to have the largest and most widespread dinosaur population while using Tyrannosaurs and Raptors to eat everyone else's dinosaurs. The are several options available to you each turn, and the theme (though not necessary) adds a nice touch of lighthearted flavour. 

Don't play it with 6 though. 4 is ideal, 5 is fine, but 6 throws half of the game's mechanisms out of whack.

The bits are wonderful. The similarities to El Grande are inviting to a player who enjoys that game. It's all about area control with all the inherent leader whacking you get in that type of game. Unlike El Grande there's six fixed abilities each round, so the leader whacking abilities are reliably available every round. While that doesn't afford the game much variation it's good to know which abilities to look out for each round, either on the giving end or the receiving end. Not sure if it's going to make the game hit the table often due to a lack of variation each game. It does mean the game will be best with less than six, so the last player at least gets a choice between abilities.

Unfortunately, although it has some interesting deviations from El Grande, it's let down by not elegantly dealing with the turn order issue. El Grande builds this into the cards and players' strategies, but in Triassic Terror it's a simple pass it to the next player mechanic. This is completely unsatisfactory because the final player in the game has a huge advantage, which is given rather than earned. Looking for a house rule that'll fix this and make me want to bring the game to the table often. It deserves it because other than this flaw it's quite a decent game. I prefer El Grande, but who can't like all those little dinosaurs and the spontaneous growling sounds.

The box insert is really well done also; there's plenty of room of everything and the organizer makes it wasy to set up and put away quickly.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is an role selection, area-control game where players are groups of dinosaurs roaming around the world fighting for majorities while targeting other players with predators (T. rex, pterodactyls, raptors) and volcano eruptions! It doesn't have the evolution/gene type mechanism you might expect from a game in this setting. Instead, the theme comes through from all the rampaging and killing going on! Like El Grande, though, players need to be aware not only of the current score but also current board position -- gotta know who to target with your killing!

It's a fun game, but like El Grande and Vinci, the perceived leader gets bashed; and that's a bit annoying if he's not actually leading. That's just part of the game, but having to say "I'm not really leading -- get HIM!" Repeatedly gets old. With repeated play and more game experience, this would almost certainly go away, but I don't really play any game repeatedly (almost)!

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
The board (double-sided for differing player counts) shows 4 environments (quarters of the board: mountain, desert, forest, swamp), each divided into 3 areas (concentric arcs within each quarter) which all have 3 habitats. Each habitat can hold one player's herd (= any number of dinos of that player), is ranked (move players herds to positions by area majority; tiebreaker = first in that area) and worth VP (3rd spot only worth VP in 4-6er games). Players will start with dinos on the board in specific locations (based on player count and initial turn order). They also have a Hatch Counter and a Volcano Counter. The game T rex, raptors, and pterodactyl start in specific areas as well. There is a track of 6 role cards, shuffled and placed in random order (add a bonus dino to the last 1-2 roles); and a deck of environment cards matching the 4 environs, with one face-up card on display. 

[u]Game Flow[/u]
There are 2 (in 6er game) or 3 Eras (the eras have 3 Turns, 3 Turns, then 2 or 3 Turns depending on player count) in the game.
- At the start of each Era, players draw one environment card (the face up one, or top of deck); at the end, there is a scoring.
- At the start of each Turn, players take one of the 6 action tiles -- that also sets the new player order. 
- In player order, players take their Player Turn
- At the end of each Turn (after all players have taken their turn), slide unused role cards down to the end of the track and add a dino to it. Shuffle the used cards and place in random order on the track.

[u]Your Turn[/u]
In any order:
- play your environment card (if any): add 3 dinos to the matching environment
- add the extra dino, if you got any with your role card, to your existing herd(s)
- use your role:
... [i]New Environment[/i]: add 3 dinos to any single environment
... [i]Herd Growth[/i]: add 3 dinos to one of your herds, 2 to another
... [i]Herd Migration[/i]: migrate 2 of your (different) herds (some or all dinos in each herd). Take 1 dino from every other player in the original environment (convert them to your color), then may move to the same or different adjacent areas. If moving to a new environment, one dino dies.
... [i]Hatch[/i]: add 3 dinos to one of your herds. Also, move the pterodactly up to 2 areas, then kill up to 2 dinos there. 
... [i]T-Rex[/i]: replace the current T-rex with your own colored miniature, move it 1 space and eat up to 5 dinos, or 2 spaces and up to 3 dinos. After eating, place the T-rex with your herd in that area; it counts as 3 dinos for area majority
.. [i]Raptors[/i]: move one of them 1 area, and the other 2. After each move, eat up to 2 dinos, then scatter up to 2 dinos (move them to an available habitat in an adjacent area -- may only switch environments if no habitat available)
- if still available, use your Hatch Counter (same as Hatch action) or Volcano Counter; max one of these per Era. Volano: place in an area; 2 dinos from primary habitat, and 1 from any others there, die. The counter remains in the area till the start of your next turn. Predators may not enter, and dinos may neither enter nor leave, that area while counter is present.

[u]Scoring[/u]
- Score VP shown for habitats
- Score for Presence or Domination (depending on Era and player count):
... Presence: 8VP if you have dinos/T-rex in all 4 environments
... Domination: for each environment, score 8/4/2VP based on players' totals of of dinos/T-rex

[u]Game End[/u]
After final scoring, the player with the most VP wins (tiebreakers: most dinos/T-rex, then number of Primary Habitats, then Secondary, then Tertiary).

Decent game, but doesn't really do anything new or interesting. The actions are very well balanced and ultimately it feels like a "bash on the leader" combined with constant politicking to get ahead.

This is outstanding for what it is, and probably deserves a higher rating than I am giving it. Triassic Terror is a terrific design that achieves the near-impossible: great balance in a take-that area control game. It also mitigates the frustration some people feel of being picked-on in a take-that game with a terrific theme - who can complain about rampaging plastic dinosaurs? The game is just too fun to worry about being targeted! The decision of which role to take usually isn't hard, but how to maximize the role you get often is challenging. I'm not a big fan of games with a take-that, bash-the-leader element, so Triassic Terror gets only a "7" in my book. But if this is your thing, Triassic Terror is best in class and definitely shows the refinement and polish resulting from 13 years of development by designer Peter Hawes.

Fabulous area control game. Played at Cancon this year in a highly competitive game. This is the ultimate area control game. You have total flexibility in your options and many areas to work in. The 6 action cards provide all manner of options from starting new herds in new environments,to growth, migration and then attacking your opponents and scattering them with 2 separate raptor attacks. Finally you have the T-Rex option and the neat trick of him adding 3 to your dinosaur count and giving a presence in an environment. The pterodactyl and eruptng volcanoes also are tactically useful.

Great compoinents and nice artwork on the board and box. Look forward to many more games of this one.

For lovers of area control games, this is one of the best. Elegantly simple in design but rich in depth of stategies available. The six actions are strategically very different, but each is equally valuable depending on the state of play. 

The large board with its 4 terrains and 36 habitats means you have countless possibilities each turn, so clever play wins out instead of what card you draw etc. Here you play the game not the reverse.

One of the best themed games I have played and I like the dinosaur artwork, plastic dinosaurs and dino meeples which bring the game to life. Good quality production.

Dinosaurs are really awesome. I'd like to see if their presence in this game is just superficial, or is it an actual dinosaur game.

A very mean game but because of the Dino theme this is pretty thematic as a battle of the fittest. The graphic design could be better in places but the game itself is very solid. I love the theme and because of this alone i cannot see this leaving the collection anytime soon.

Aggressive, take the leader down area control with fantastic components. A bit longer than necessary, could be a good family affair with plenty of dinosaurs eating each other and trying to survive.

Excellent game for players liking action selection and area control. This was the stand-out game for me at Cancon 2013. My favorite genre is area control and I enjoyed this better than some of my other top ten games like El Grande, Australia, Mexica and Louis IV.

The box is striking and the board impressive with the dinosaur footprints as the score track. The 6 action tiles drive the game and give a great variety of options, from strictly growing your herds, through some growth and eating 2 opponents with the pterodactyl, to out and out depleting other herds using the two Raptors (each killing 2 and scattering 2 of the rest) and T-Rex which eats 5 (or 3 if it travels further).

The board has 4 terrains and 36 habitats. With 4-5 herds each on the board and the 6 different possible actions there is plenty to do. The depth of play here is enormous and the decision making process is much more demanding than El Grande, which till now, has been my best area control game.

I think what was really appealing was the fact that the theme was not pasted on. I felt the "terror" as the T-Rex munched through five of my brontosaurs in my biggest herd. With raptors, T-Rex, pterodactyls, volcanoes and the 15 big plastic miniatures the age of the dinoasurs came to life for me. 

Judging by the reaction of players at Cancon, this game will be a big hit with area control buffs like me, especially since it can be played by two to six players. Can't wait to get my copy from this new Aussie Game company Kayal Games who promise big production games like this one.

This game took me by surprise. 
I am a big fan of strategy and tactics in games, but find it very difficult to find people willing to throw down in the mental arena. This game takes traditional strategic and tactical methods used by other games and makes them much easier to understand and much, much more fun to use.
I am confident that this game could be enjoyed by both serious and casual gamers at the same time. After a few quick turns the game mechanics click into place and melt together to form a cohesive logical game structure that doesn't require hours of deep transic thought to understand and play.
I like that I can take this game off the shelf and know that it will be back up there in under 2 hours. I like that every player's decisions impact and change the flow of play, making no single player elite or immune to game mechanics. I like that there are plenty of choices but never too mamy. I like that the theme fits and doesn't feel tacked on. 
I like the raptors.
I like the T-Rex.
From components, to box design (you need to see it; it just works), to the artwork, the game conveys the theme well. 
I have to admit that I was skeptical. I thought that dinosaurs were something I was only interested when I was little. 
As it turns out. Eating dinosaurs with other dinosaurs, scattering herds into unfamiliar lands and migrating off to new environments with your enemies units never ever gets old.

A fun (light-ish) romp through the Triassic.  I would play this again.

RATING: 7
A solid game.  The rules aren't that tough to teach at all, once one person has a good interpretation of the different moves. A straightforward area control game that moves at a decent pace with a very fun theme and a good puzzle to ponder on.

Personally though, I like a bit more chaos and randomness in my games and I think I felt like that was lacking here. I love games that inspire a lot of table talk and negotiation and misdirection.  I think I prefer Peter Hawes other games to this one for varying reasons.  This feels like a solid Euro with some bullying.

I could certainly see how some people would love this game, it's just not quite my style.  Still would be happy to play it, and it's hard to find games that can seat up to 6.

I was surprised with how deep the strategy is for this game. The rules are easy to explain and the turns are quick. There's very little downtime.

Only a few plays so far, but this one comes off as a winner. I think it would be terrible with 2p without heavy modification. 3p was good, but it still seemed to leave the board a little empty. Still very fun. I feel like it will really shine with 4+.

Doesn't do anything particularly new, but it does it well, and and it's fun.  Plays well with 6 and lots of opportunity to beat on each other with dinosaurs.  What's not to like?

Interactive area control with dinosaur meeples on Dino Island complete with swamps, jungle, desert and a center island volcano. Get majority of habitats that score most points. Place your dino mini on an action tile. Incentive tokens placed on unused actions. Lots of screwage actions using raptors, t-rex, hatch, and migration. Straight forward intuitive game and the action tiles have unique twists that reflect the theme. Cost penalty for crossing different terrains. Got to play with more people for max fun. Lots of negotiation and piling on the leader. This might be my favorite gateway for screw your neighbor games because it is immediately in your face, plays fast, and is above all fun. I've even converted a couple of care bear players. At the end they want more meat!

More plays and it might go higher.
Played a 3 player and it was painful learning all at same time but I saw potential.
UPDATE- 12/13
OK, again don't decide game based on one groups thoughts (must make this my mantra).
Got rid of this to quick, one of the best conflict, area control games of the year. Must get it back
UPDATE- 01/14
High trade value, not very willing to part with it yet, but for the right offer... specifically Wishlist(1) games.
UPDATE- 01/14 Sometimes you just want other games more... sigh. I will own you again TT!!

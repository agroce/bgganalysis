Das mit dem Karten-Etui ist wirklich nett gemacht. Ich mag auch das Thema mit den Tieren. Und die Multi-funktionskarten, wenn die Idee auch nicht mehr neu ist.

Was mir nicht so gefällt, ist die Action auf dem Spielplan: die ist nicht so furchtbar spannend, und sie ein wesentliches Problem hat. Um effizient zu sein, muss man seine Forscher wellenartig über den Plan ziehen lassen (um diese jeweils doppelt zu nutzen), "springen" ist viel zu aufwendig. Aus den Startaufstellungen und die Richtungen, für die die Spieler sich entscheiden, kann sich schnell mal eine Situation ergeben, wo ein Spieler rungestört grasen kann, während sich andere ins Gehege kommen, und dadurch ist dann über Sieg und Niederlage schon so gut wie entschieden.
Das Spiel ist daher in unserer Runde und auch am Nachbartisch mehr oder weniger durchgefallen.

LIKE: light and easy. fun decisions with card powers. fresh theme.
DISLIKE: can be luck dependent. cube colors are hard to distinguish. card powers need to be looked up first time playing, but a bit easier afterwards.
OVERALL: good, light couples/family game. the luck can be mitigated easily with 4 card draw instead of 3, but the 3-card draw makes decisions harder. I currently don't mind the luck of the draw.

Un medio-filler de Feld, entretenido, muy dependiente de la suerte, con materiales y grafismo bonitos y poco más que añadir, teniendo en cuenta el autor, se queda muy corto para las espectativas, pero es que el juego es lo que es, no pretende ser nada más.

Market speculation is fun most of the time (although there is no real market in this game), and La Isla is no exception. You are seizing the opportunities presented while trying to push up the market value of the animals you have captured. Points are awarded in small increments everywhere, which I personally like. I know some people detest point salads but I think they are great because no single move or little mistake usually becomes decisive. Instead, good play is rewarded throughout the whole course of the game.

Most of the time the decision of which action to take, which special powers to keep and which animals to push up in the market is hard. Usually the thing that benefits you the most will force you to play another card in a way that potentially gives even a bigger benefit to your opponents. Agonising over this is fun.

A fun and light game I have to say. Nothing spectacular but fun.

One of Stefan Felds more streamlined "simple" games revolving around set collection and area control. It is a game where the rules mostly get out of the way of theme and play, which for a Feld is uncommon. Even better, it works! It reminds me of Rialto in that the game is simple to learn, mechanically streamlined but still interesting enough to keep you wanting to play again and again, and not too bad on the eyes. it also seems to have been made before or after his BDSM phase as the game doesn't seem to punish you throughout play like in Notre dame or Macao or Trajan etc.

Quite entertaining little placement game with simple-ish rules.  Matt is right that it has stock-holding elements too.  It's engaging and doesn't take too long.  My only complaints are that the player aid is way too tiny and there's only one of them.

RATING: 3
Neat game, although always burning one passive bonus isn't that much fun when you have a great combo going.

Played again, still didn't really like it.  If you get bad draws (or draws that don't work together) multiple turns in a row, you just watch the rest of the players try to win while you await your defeat.  Not cool, especially for a game that takes 45 minutes.

If you're playing 2 player, I rate this a 5, if you are playing 4 player this is an 8.

Sure, it's "Feld Light," but it's a clever little game. The only issue I see with it is the 'ladder' placement of the explorers...you get 4 out and then just walk them around the outer ring of the board. Simple solution is to get in there and mix things up a bit. Haven't played with 4 yet, only 2 and 3.

mmm....allora...una volta studiato il regolamento sembra un giochetto facile facile.Ma iniziata la partita cosi semplice poi non è.Le carte sono tantissime e permettono tantissime combo.Facile quindi ritrovarsi in paralisi da analisi anche se si gioca alla leggera (figuriamoci in una sfida tra giocatori navigati).Tutta tattica e pochissima strategia.Le scelte cambiano in base a dove si sposta l'avversario.L'iconografia delle carte è abbastanza chaira ma  essendoci tante possibiltà per giocarci bene ci vogliono diverse partite secondo me.Bello il tabellone ed il tema.:-)

Interesting Feld.  Not as convoluted as his usual point salad games.  A little difficult comprehend the symbols at first, but I think that was because we were all new at it.  By the end of the first game, we're all pretty comfortable with the basic mechanics.  Not clear how much depth there is in this game.  My hypothesis is that the game is won on your initial decision on where in the island to start.  In fact, I suspect that the last person to place can set the pace, and is a significant advantage.

RATING: 5
There are elements of the game design in La Isla that are moderately pleasing, including the modular board, the interesting card engine building, and particularly, determining each round which card capabilities to sacrifice.  

However, these modest virtues do not rise much above the overall lack of an actual theme here, confusing graphics, and far too conspicuous and unpleasant reminders in this game that the luck of the card draws determines whether you win, or lose the game.   

In general, the decisive nature of luck in games can be eliminated, mitigated or disguised through basic euro design ideas.  But here, the luck of the draw is far too conspicuous for my tastes, as it either feeds your card engine, or it doesn't, round after round.  Darn no cards with brown cubes on them!  Curses!  Bad luck! Darn, no cards with hamsters on them! Curses!  Bad luck!  Once is definitely enough for this game.

Stefan Feld makes another great game that is apparently being over looked because it isn't terribly heavy. I mean come on! This game is #597 on the Geek List. It is fantastic. In La Isla instead of using dice to determine any actions you get a hand of cards. Each turn you get to do three different things with those cards. You can use them to get special abilities that make it easier for you accomplish your goals. But don;t get used to those abilities as you can only have a certain number of them and every turn you add a new ability so you are gonna lose one of them sooner or later. You can use the card to get the resources you need to explore the island and observe unique animals. or you can use the cards to make certain animal inherently more valuable point wise by the end of the game. there are strategic and tactical decisions to make each and every turn.  This game needs to be played by more people.

When I played this, I felt like the game was playing me. All you have to do is to chose the obviously correct order for your three cards (the one that gives you most points) and then placing a figure on the board. Thats it. If you are lucky, you get a bunch of points. If not, you lose.

Slightly lighter for a Feld, but his hand is clearly at work in the design. Interesting how you use the card holder to either take actions or place special powers, and you're basically trying to surround various rare animal species out on the island board with your explorers. I like the colorful board, and along with Rialto it's a good gateway into his heavier games.

Initial rating, based on playing once. Further plays would probably reduce my rating, but for the moment I'm left with a mostly favorable impression of this game. The components are rather cheap feeling, the colors on the board are confusing (white/grey/brown are too heavily textured, and aren't a good match for the colors of the cubes), and there's not all that much depth to this game, but I like the card holder mechanism, and the way the very strongly constrained resources make it a near-requirement to plan your moves ahead quite a bit.

A deceiving game that looks quite easy, but at it's core is a hard, unforgiving game. The theme is also nice enough.

My problem with it is that it's actually quite AP prone. Even for an intuitive player like me, taking decisions in this game seem to last forever.

Good game, but I'm not always in the mood to play it.

Another cool idea from Feld.  A kind of evolution of Brugge's card mechanism, but now forcing the situation.  Three cards with three uses each in your turn, and you must assign one card to each use.  And create combos...  Nice theme to disguise the game, which works really fine as a light game.  Really fast and good fun.  The board is a bit caleodoscopic which may not be the cup of tea of a few, but it works and makes each game slightly different because of the distribution of the explorer's fields.
Nice addition to Alea's collection.  On the lightest side of Feld production.

Played this a lot two player - there is a bit of theme there and there is an interesting mix of mechanics.  Choosing how to "spend" your three cards each round is a lot of fun.  Sure sometimes its really straight forward but it is fun.

Some cards are more powerful than others - yet to play with the advanced cards or with 3+ players which might add depth and offer a wider range of strategies.  

update - yeah the advanced cards pretty much fix everything and add more strategies.  You cannot get away with waiting for the right combination of cards to come up for one strategy you need to adapt to the cards and what your opponents are doing.

RATING: 4
Bleh. Played with the full 4 players (it doesn't play 5), and there are just too few ways to interact with the other players. Combined with the luck of the card draw (significant, it turns out), this game is too light for me.

OLD COMMENT: A 6 with room to grow. The stock market, the area enclosure, and some of the action cards create some neat interplayer dynamics. I don't know if I'd enjoy this with 2 players again, or at least long term. But with 3-5 players, this could be a not-so-hidden gem.

"La Isla" ist diesmal kein taktisches Schwergewicht von Stefan Feld, sondern ein eher lockeres Spiel mit ausgewogenem Taktik-Glück-Verhältnis. Die Idee mit den Etuis und den Sonderfunktionen ist hübsch und ermöglicht mehrere Taktiken. Schade nur, dass das Spielmaterial etwas zu klein und zu dünn ausgefallen ist.

First play: very Feld game with more randomness than Id normally like but it's over quite quickly. Consider it a chunky filler.

2nd play 2 years later. I seem to have deliberately forgotten this game and for good reason. The lottery of the cards is absolute and it's interesting to see how players can be oblivious to that fact when the cards fall their way. My power options were very lame from the start and I soon ran out of cubes, whereas others had nice combos for generating cubes that tied in with their preferred animals. Next if you have a nice power that allows (say) yellow to be anything, it is useless if you get no cards that offer you any yellow cubes. If you can't place new explorers and take the animals first, you are screwed. Don't get the preferred animal you get zero points. Less animals = less points, this really is a lesson in blind futility.

A really frustrating game that plays you. People say you must play the cards that you are dealt. That's very glib if you are dealt useful cards. Down rated from 6.5 to 4.5. Not a game I'd ever want to willingly play again.

Another point salad set collection game by Stefan Feld in which every round you have a choice of how to use three cards that you are dealt. It plays relatively fast despite a first play iconography hurdle; so it could be considered a super filler. On a second play, the game should substantially be shorter.

Even though I won my first play by a wide margin, I felt like randomness and luck might have played a role in the win. The decisions are interesting, but I feel that they would wane with subsequent plays. It's cute, it's fast, it's mediocre, it's filler Feld!

One of the many Feld titles I own. The lightest of the bunch. It has quite a nice mechanic with the cards, which leads to some interesting choices when deciding how to assign each card. It's less tense than I usually go for, but certainly a nice change of pace when I've got less time or want a more casual experience than my normal fare. I do wish there were more interaction between players. You can try to swoop in and capture an animal before an opponent, but usually it's just as beneficial to do your own thing and not mess with each other too much. It also doesn't scale that great between player counts. Definitely more delightfully tense with a full 4 players, still good with 3, and a little bland with 2.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Compared with most of Feld's recent stuff, La Isla is a light game. Some of the basic ideas here are neat, but I expect the replay value is very low. Play 3 cards in 3 places, get a special power, get a resource, place an explorer (and maybe get one or more tiles/animals), score an animal type. That quick, straightforward turn order is good to keep the game zipping along. However, the part where players are basically forced to keep putting explorers near where they put them before seems to greatly limit options on the board. I don't really have an interest in playing this again.

I did enjoy the tableau building aspect / programming on this one, however not so sure i enjoyed the area control / set collection part.  I also think the theme and components are blah, but it is a Feld, so I kind of expected this going in. For whatever reason it took my brain a little while to understand the scoring, so one I am interested to try more of too see if I end up liking it more.

Sept 2014 - Interesting game of racing to gather up sets of animals, manipulating their worth on a stock market type of board and potentially driving the game to an end when you feel you have the advantage.  I like those types of games and this is a good, quick one in that realm.  Gameplay is clean and simple and card driven.  The synergy with your speical modifications for actions is key to being as efficient as possible.  Rating could (expect) go up.  Played with 3.

A great idea of area control and set collection, but it ends up being a bit ruined by the main gameplay mechanic of choosing 3 cards to play in different ways. I should love this mechanic, as I love puzzley elements in games, but this just ended up feeling really chancey instead of puzzley. The difference between Yellow and Natural colors messed with me throughout the game. Update 3 years later: I remember disliking this more than I did apparently (originally rated 5.6). I played it again thankfully, and enjoy it more, but I still think the luck factor is really high. This could easily be fixed with some kind of rule where you spend 3 cubes of the same color or 3 cubes of a different color to equal whatever you want. Cubes are definitely the biggest chance issue from what I can tell, and it's a real shame because A no one I know would play with my house rules B it should have to have them and C it's a genuinely fun and great game otherwise. I would easily rate this game a 7 or higher if it weren't for the cubes. As it is, a solid 6.5.

Light, fun Feld with the characteristic agonizing decisions that define most of his games. It is a little on the luck-heavy side, but unlike the huge luck-swings in Bruges, this little game doesn't last long enough for it to have a huge impact on my enjoyment. A perfect little Euro filler, up there with Finca, Glen More, and Patrician as a go-to game if you're in the mood for something fast and light.

La Isla is one of Stefan Feld’s lighter games. It’s pretty relaxing and only takes 30-40 minutes to play with 2-4. There IS a little to think about during the game, but in general I (and those I played with a couple of times) thought that it was often quite obvious which cards to choose in each phase… Not that the cards play you, but it did feel like the cards dictated your strategy somewhat and that it wouldn’t be advisable to change the strategy. But of course you have to think a little about which card to use in phase A, B and D, and it's not always a given (oh, and phase C is where you actually put a guy out on the board, and that is where the area enclosing mechanic comes into play).

Speaking of the cards, there is a fair amount of luck; some seems to be better than others, and generally speaking some cards are awesome to draw at the start of the game while not being too good later on, and some cards are hard to get a benefit from at the beginning of the game. I’m of course only speaking about the A phase, as that’s where the bonus/abilities of the cards are most crucial! But you can actually also get a bad card draw if you don’t draw any cards you can use for phase d, the scoring of the tokens…

I do like the abilities you get in phase A, and the rule that states that you have to play a card means that your abilities constantly change during the game. I also really liked the area enclosing mechanic in which it’s all about being first to surround certain areas on the board in order to be the first one to claim a tile – that made the turn order quite important, especially in the 2p game.

Finally, of course the theme isn’t there, but had you really expected anything else for a game by Feld? Personally I think the game is “fine”, but it’s not something I’m rushing out to get, and while it’s not a game I always want to play, it’s not a bad little game to play from time to time as it’s sort of a meaty filler with a lot of variety from game to game due to the multiple usage of the cards.

There really isn't much going on in this game. The biggest flare is that you get three power up cards to keep using though out the game, which is mildly interesting, but the rest of the game is just meh. Put your dudes on a map and try and surround stuff to collect it. That stuff scores points. So, really it's just a race. And there is really no hand management as the game randomly decides if you have a good turn or not. At least, for this Feld game, the points generally come from one place (the collected chits).

Probably my favorite Feld. Yes it's light, but it hits a sweet spot for me in terms of gameplay. Turns are quick because you are only looking at 3 cards every turn and a lot of the actions can be done simultaneously. The actions you get are a big plus for the game, with perhaps the ones giving VPs being a bit overpowered if you play them right and combo them well. I am eager to play this again, I just wish there were more player aids.

I really like this game! However, I had to mark it down because of 1. all the fiddly pieces - the cards are small, the resource cubes are tiny - 2. the choice of colours - the cream and yellow resources are very difficult to distinguish on the cards. It's a real shame as the game is fun and the animals very cute!

I wanted to like this game more - Stefan Feld and multi-use cards usually are appealing to me. Felt the theme was obfuscated (people were confused that we were documenting the animals and not capturing/killing them) and you often were not making very interesting choices in regards to which 3 cards to play (the powers were rather bland). The scoring chart was lackluster as well.

RATING: 8
While one of Feld's lighter offerings, I really enjoy this one. Quick to explain, quick to play, the game still offers interesting decisions as you decide in how you distribute cards for the round.  The variable set-up presents a slight challenge in how to optimize the randomness.

Pretty neat. Not my favorite by Stefan Feld, mostly due to the game's random element, but it's got some pretty and colorful artwork, neat game mechanics, plays fast and there's a lot to consider before acting. I just wish that the wooden (or light greyish or whatever you wanna call them) cubes would be either black or red or something that would make them stand out more.

First play through was rough. The production quality was generally considered poor. The plastic figures are small and feel cheap. The score board is small and feels cheap. The player aid is small, feels cheap, and is only printed once for each supported language (you really need four copies). Further, the reference information requires twice the printed size, but isn't correlated to a single sheet. You might have English on one side and German on the opposite side, so you need to dig through each of the sheets trying to find the other one that has the information in your language. As a tip, though, you can use the rulebook if needed. The information on both the aid and in the rulebook is incredibly small and hard to read, but you at least have two copies that way.

The game-play is very light. You get three cards and choose one benefit for each card. This leads to some simple tactical choices at times, but everyone agreed that the cards almost play themselves. 

One of your choices gives you powers that provide benefits in future actions. One of those benefits is the privilege of choosing from four cards instead of three. In our game, the player that got that card in the first round won the game handily, so it felt a bit overpowered. I'm not ready to say it definitely is, but I would consider removing that card in future plays.

Great family game - a step up from a gateway game, I'd say, but easy enough for both children (10 & 13) to pick up and understand after the first round. The exploring, collecting animals theme helped sustain their interest as well. Simple actions, yet difficult choices to make in which cards to use for what function, and good engine building possibilities. We enjoyed it so much we didn't want to stop at the required point (when the animal markers add up to 11 for a four player game), so we carried on for another four rounds! A great way to introduce the children to Feld and his glorious point salads!

Nuevo juego de Feld. Es un juego de adaptarte a la mano que tienes y aprovecharla lo mejor posible en el tablero. Sin ser un imprescindible es de lo mejorcito de esta serie mediana de Alea, junto a Louis XIV (el mejor), Palazzo y Saint malo. Aún así el azar tiene un peso importante en el juego.
Edito: al final lo vendí porque en ocasiones el azar era más determinante que las propias decisiones de los jugadores. Una pena porque era agradable jugarlo (cuando la mala suerte no te afecta a ti) y los componentes eran chulos. Para jugarlo con la copia de otro.

RATING: 6
A cute and friendly game, slightly reminiscent of Feld's earlier offering Brugge in that cards dictate your course of action. The twist is, however, that you have a little bit more control over how the supporting actions are going to guide you for the upcoming few turns, yielding a pleasant, but of course not truly exciting, way to introduce some planning. The idea is that you surround animals with researchers which are then claimed for science; at the same time you attempt to increase their multiplier value for the end-of-game scoring. Actually capturing the creatures can yield a decent amount of points so should not be shunned as an activity, though.

The actual game is not without problems. The card randomness will influence matters considerably, and if you don't like this then La Isla is a title to be avoided. But even so: I don't think it is actually possible to create major scoring gaps given competent play. In order to efficiently capture animals researchers tend to stick together; breaking up the group makes this process a lot less efficient. Adding insult to injury the smallest areas to be surrounded (meaning those with the least placement effort) are worth almost nothing VP-wise (which in itself might be a balancing factor)... but due to the random setup there is no guarantee whatsoever that such lonely islets contain the animals you need for a targetted collection effort. That means that people tend to obtain a balanced whole because they grab what comes their way, with cards semi-randomly played determining the biggest part of the multiplier. Riiiight. The game would have been a lot better if players were enticed to specialise in one way or the other, because right now, they can't. Or rather, they are not suitably rewarded.

Then again, I might be wrong about this as I cannot really imagine a dedicated tester [i]not[/i] trying this out, i.e. going after specific animals as efficiently as possible. Because he likes dodos or something. Next time I play, I'm going to see what happens if I start pushing the system rather forcibly.

[b]Update[/b] Yes, it is possible to win with just a small number of animal types, but it depends strongly on getting the correct animal type cards to grab the necessary VP, for if you don't you're toast. The game is probably probabilistically balanced in that results from hand to hand mean little, and that an overall win percentage given a lot of games means a lot. Still... because the mechanism of collecting the animals while at the same time increasing their multiplier isn't that silly, I wish the game offered more control here. It's not exactly a short affair, after all. For that reason a meager 6.

Another Stefan Feld game and it did not disappoint. I'm not ready to say it's my favorite or anything like that, but it was enjoyable. The theme is lightly pasted-on per usual, but the mechanics are fresh and interesting. The modular board and large amount of cards allows for what appears to be a lot of replayability, which is a big bonus. Tonight's 3 player game was tightly contested and I look forward to future games of this one. One drawback is that the components are of rather inferior quality, but I suppose that's what you get for the price (only about $25 on Amazon I think). The little card display that each player gets feels like it will rip very easily and they only gave one reference sheet with the box, when 4 would have been much smarter. We had to keep passing it around every turn for at least half the game until we started to understand the icons. Feld usually does a nice job making the icons easily understood, but it still takes a couple games to feel like you don't need to refer to things.

Too small a box and an insert that is a pain. The only way I got the stuff in the box was to store the cubes and figures under the sides of the insert. My advise is to throw the insert away.

The rule book is too small, as small as font as you can get, very hard to comfortable read, one of the boards is of very thin stock.

A decent light weight Feld's game given its length of play.

 A bit of interaction, you are playing to surround an animal to catch it, others are too, there may be overlapping, sharing of a location,  leading to a stealing of an animal before you can get it, the problem of having to pick your A card as a rule modifier  and B for a needed resource is problematic if your third card will drive up the value of an animal of an opponent so you have to balance these picks.

While I didn't really get this game at first, after several plays on Yucata it started to click. I now like the puzzle aspect of figuring out your best A/B/D combination for cards to get what you want and advance the value of the animal tiles you have.

On the downside, this feels a lot like multi-player solitaire. The only real "interaction" is the competition you have to advance animal columns that you have but others don't.

A pretty good game, but not exceptional for me.

Managed to play this with 3 players at the Saturday meetup. The card play leads to some interesting choices in terms of which of all these good cards are you going to send to the various player board sections. Despite having a board in front of you, there is no blocking of other players and that makes it easier to maneuver. 

The interesting part of the game was the puzzle that the card play represents. You're going to have to make tough choices about what effects you're going to lose or pass on. The board is quite open and never felt tight. With such a large board and so many options, it lacked that sense of urgency that AquaSphere or Trajan has. My least favorite Feld and one that appears only plays well with max player count.

I am not a fan of Stefan Feld's designs, but for some reason my buddies always persuade me to play his games. This is one of his most unthematic games ad the mechanisms don't compensate for that. Furthermore, the game board is so busy it makes you dizzy (hey it rhymed!). I don't think I'll play it again.

La Isla is a nice light tactical card game with a little bit of engine building, variable player powers and area control thrown into the mix. Unfortunately, I've only played it online over at Yucata and never face to face. Part of the problem is the theme and maybe also the lightness of the design that doesn't resonate so well with my gaming group. So if you're thinking about getting it, make sure you know the right people to play it with. Then it is a really nice short exercise in efficiency with some room for clever play.
Note: I've only played with the advanced cards.

I'm not really a fan of recent Feld but this is really quite good, at least after two plays. He seems to have borrowed a lot from Pfister's Mombasa but made it shorter and simpler. Not bad at all.

Edit: Some very serious broken strategy questions are coming up. Rating may soon be dropping.

Edit: After getting lapped through no fault of my own with no possible response I don't want to play this game again. Once again Feld, based on his reputation, has released a deeply flawed product. Major publishers should take more personal responsibility for their reputation, imho.

though the compenents of the game may look (and are) a bit cheap e.g the explorers are made from plastic instead of wooden meeples and the gamerules are hard to read (or something most be wrong with my eyes) the game itself is great: nice gameboarsd, if you like to puzzle, and a lots of little cards. It is a tactical game in which you will get frustrated because you can not explorere that tile you are so eager about. The way of scoring points is something that we are used of by Stefan Feld. Using the Dodo in a game makes it even more fun. It still believe that funny animal is still walking the earth somewehere -:)

Game play is a 7 but I want to rate this a 5 due to the poor components.   I've seen better quality game components on the back of cereal boxes.   The pockets are cheap, the scoreboard is practically a sheet of paper, and the animal chips are so tiny.   Come on, Alea.   This is embarassing.  You should be charging $10-15 for this with these components.

The game itself is pretty fun!   It's a simple Feld, and I much prefer him at that end of the spectrum.   It's a basic planning game where you assign three cards to three standard actions each round in an effort to capture endangered animals.  (Maybe not capturing them, but whatever, that's how I like to think of it).   There is a bit of a stock market aspect as players attempt to influence the final scoring value for each animal.   Quick and simple to play.  Good for people who like to plan each turn.   There's quite a bit of luck, but the game gives the satisfying illusion of control due to the planning aspect.   That's probably it's greatest achievement.

Lassan be kell valljam önmagamnak, hogy kedvelem Feld játékait. Habár ez egy könnyed darab, amiben egy ötletes kártyamechanizmus található, egy egyszerű táblán lévő körbekerítősdivel, mellyel rég elfeledett és kihalt állatokat próbálunk begyűjteni egy szigeten. Persze azért van min agyalni itt is, de alapvetően a 3 (esetenként 4) felhúzott kártyalap legideálisabb és nekünk legmegfelelőbb felhasználásával kell kihozni a maximumot. Mivel egy kártyalapot háromféleképpen lehet felhasználni, vagy akcióként vagy nyersanyagként vagy az állatok értékének emelésére, így nem is olyan egyszerű kitalálni, mi lenne a legideálisabb lépés. Szerencsére a játék gyorsítására vannak olyan fázisok, melyet a játékosok egyszerre tudnak végrehajtani. Különböző stratégiák mentén lehet operálni. A sógorom azzal győzött ellenem, hogy összesen egyetlen állatlapkát gyűjtött be a kezdeti dupla mellé, viszont a kártyák akcióinak felhasználásával, megpróbálta minél feljebb tornázni ennek az állatnak az értékét, így a végére minden értékeléskor sok győzelmi pontot tudott összegyűjteni, hiszen amikor egy állat értéke nőtt, egyből értékelés következett. Az én stratégiám ezzel szemben az volt, hogy megpróbáltam minden állatfajtából szerezni, hiszen egy ilyen sorozat 10 győzelmi pontot ér a végén + minden állatfajta után a játék végi aktuális értékével is lehet pontokat szerezni, de végül 6 ponttal lemaradtam. A játék így is nagyon tetszett. Amúgy is szeretem a kártyavezérelt játékokat, s ahol még több felhasználásúak is a kártyák, azok a kedvenceim. Szerintem simán elmegy családi játéknak is, mert egyáltalán nem bonyolultak a szabályai. Előszörre a kártyák felhasználási módja kissé kacifántosnak tűnhet, de hamar bele lehet rázódni, amit a jól értelmezhető ikonográfia és a jól összeállított segédlet is segít. A segédletet érdemes figyelmesen elolvasni, mert mi úgy jártunk, hogy csak a képek alatti részt olvastuk és még csodálkoztunk is, hogy az egyik lapnak milyen erős a képessége, miszerint egy nyersanyagért cserébe lehet felhelyezni az emberkét a táblára, majd később, mikor egy másik lapnak a hatását kerestük, akkor döbbentünk rá, hogy az előző kártyát rosszul értelmeztük, mert csak akkor kerül egybe a felrakás, ha egy olyan helyre tesszük, ahol már áll valaki. Na most két játékosnál ez kevésbé fordul elő :). Kezdhettük is újra a partit :). Egyébként véleményem szerint nyugodtan el lehet kezdeni a játékot mind a 180 lap felhasználásával. (2015.06.16.)

  As a loud and proud Stefan Feld fan it pains me to say how disappointing La Isla really is.  I love every other game the man has created.  Even the light and largely ignored dice game, [thing=66193][/thing], is a joy to play.  But this is just...underwhelming.  It does not help that the components are appalling: flimsy card, crazy graphic design that is a mess, stupidly small player aid cards, a small central board size, and difficult iconography which all combine to make it a real issue just getting through a game easily.  
And it hits that rather vacuous spot whereby it is too complicated for average family enjoyment (or at least my family) but just too random and uninteresting for deeper gamer’s tendencies. Let’s hope the man has not gone off the boil.

There are many games by Feld I absolutely love, but this one just fell flat.

Some powers are clearly better than others, especially the one that serves as a fourth slot. Having four slots available is huge and getting this early on can be a big advantage.

Sometimes you just get dealt a bad hand where you can't really do anything. Worse, you may actually be forced to help your opponents because you must score something and it can easily happen that there's no critter that's useful to you.

Not bad, not great. Making card combos is the junk food of the gaming hobby and who doesn't want junk food late at night? The decisions are mild here as each turn you grab 3 cards and decide where to program them on your player board.  

Each card can be played for the power (A), the cube (B), or to bump up the chit "stock market" (C). So you decide how to use the cards each turn such that you can grab a lot of chits and make them worth the most at game end. Not a bad game but there are other end-of-evening 6s out there I'd rather play.

Only played 2 player on first game.  I love most Stefan Feld games and this one met expectations.  With 2 players didn't feel like there was enough chance to block opponents moves so the game felt more like a race to get the most points the quickest.  but based on the board layout, with more players I'm sure the interaction would go up quickly.

A completely fine "cards do multiple things" game from Feld, but lighter than most Euros I play a lot, and if I'm going to be teaching a light game as a gateway, I will probably pick something like Splendor.  I'd still gladly play this if asked, but didn't see any reason to keep it in my collection when I have Bruges, Bora Bora, and Trajan to pick from - especially Bruges since it's another "cards do multiple things" game.

Este juego empezó muy frío e incluso se llevó sin rejugar unos cuantos meses después de estrenarlo. En verano lo hemos redescubierto a 3 y se ha convertido en uno de nuestros favoritos cuando se trata de echar una partida rápida. La última la jugamos en apenas 25 min. Muy chulo y simpático. Entretiene mucho y la tontería de colocar las cartas engancha.

Sokan fújnak rá, hogy full szerencsejáték, de szerintem csak másra számítanak feldtől, mint amilyen ez a játék lett. Nekem tetszett. Van benne szerencse az kétségtelen, de eléggé egyértelműen. Mindig minden körödből ki kell hozni a maximumot, és nem nagyon érdemes, előre tervezni. Ez egy taktikai játék, amiben még ezt figyelembe véve is van szerencse. De elég gyorsan lemegy hangulatos, és elég egyedi a programozós mechanizmusa. Én szívesen ülök le mellé szerintem még jópárszor. Aztán lehet, hogy 10 játék után már engem is zavarni fog a szerencse szerepe, node mivel játszanak az emberek tízszer mostanában.

La Isla is a very light game for Feld yet it stays pretty true to his design principles: points for everything you do, set collection in two different dimensions, and differentiating yourself from your fellow players through the use of special action cards. That La Isla is also a boring area enclosure set collection game might be coincidental but I'm thinking not.

Typische Feld-Denke, eine Abstraktion in klein und süß. Das Qualitätsbewusstsein hinsichtlich des Spielmaterials hat bei aleas mit LA ISLA trotz Kostenkalkulation jedoch eine unterirdische Dimension erreicht. Papier statt Pappe, Plastikforscher statt Holz und eine Schriftgrösse auf den Hilfsmitteln, die einer Lupe noch Schwierigkeiten bereitet. Billigstes China für ein eigentlich schönes Plättchensammelspiel und netten, alten Ideen. Stefan Feld gibt sich Mühe, sich mit seinen Lieblingsmechanismen stets neu zu veröffentlichen.

The first time I played it was with Ruth and Kevin. It was a hoot! 

A little tactical puzzle every turn, with just enough positional strategy to make it interesting. I traded Kevin for his copy on the spot - he ordered a replacement.

It may have a little problem with 2 players, but I'm not sure. It can go runaway in a way it doesn't seem to do in the 3 player game.

Have you played with the "advanced" cards yet? Even more fun!

The simultaneous action selection/programming provides no downtime which is nice.  The multi use cards are varied and numerous.  The decisions are fun and the cards are well balanced. I had my doubts about his two "circle" games this year but they are both winners with one heavier and one lighter and nothing feels derivative of his previous work. This designer makes creating consistently good and different games look easy.  It isn't, but playing them is!

Lighter Feld fare - reminded me a bit of Bruges in terms of tactical card management.  The challenge of using those 3 cards each time will bring me back for further plays, otherwise will likely lose out to Castles of Burgundy or Bruges in the lighter end Feldian choices...

For me a great game. Just the right amount of thinking without being to heavy for what it is. Lots of simple choices, but there is some nice strategy/combos/planning that you can do. The only problem is sometimes, you just can't the right card to get the resource you need. Some players may find that frustrating, and I get it , but I still enjoy the game even with bad drawls.

Personal: cards used for 3 different purposes, that is great. You have a board to fight with your opponent for the best places and animals, and a scoring in an imperial way (animals you have multiplied by a kind of share price). Love the card mechanic, draw 3 cards and use them for 3 different purposes (a bonus for subsequent rounds, production and increasing value of one animal)

JEM Magazin 20. szám

Felfedezőként veszélyeztetett állatok jelzőit próbáljuk begyűjteni egy moduláris táblán. Ha a felhelyezett figuráink körbevesznek egy élőlényt megkapjuk a jelzőt és pontokat is szerzünk. 
Minden körben három lapot kapuk, a lapoknak három része van. A felső egy olyan képesség, ami valamilyen bónuszt jelent a játékos számára, amíg azt aktívan tudja tartani. A bal alsóval valamilyen nyersanyag kapható, míg a jobb alsóval egy állat értékét lehet növelni. Minden körbe mind a három képességre kell egy-egy lapot használni, tehát amikor kézbe kapjuk a lapokat el kell dönteni, hogy melyiket mire fogjuk használni. Az A fázisban egy három helyes kártyatartóba kerül be az a lap, amelyiknek a felső képességét szeretnénk használni. Ebből 3 lehet akítv, így a negyedik körtől kezdve egy korábbit le kell takarni. B fázisban kapjuk a nyersanyagot, a C-ben felhelyezzük az egyik emberünket (illetve ha mind fel van, akkor áthelyezzük) két azonos nyersanyag beadásával. A D fázisban értékelődnek az állatok, amelyek összértéke elér egy bizonyos szintet, véget ér a játék. 
Feldtől szokatlanul könnyed, gyors játék. A laphúzások miatt van szerepe a szerencsének, de nem túl vészes mértékben. A moduláris tábla, a jelölők felrakásának változása és a kártyák száma miatt (két csomag is van, mi 10 játék után is még csak az elsőnél tartunk) viszonylag nagy az újrajátszhatósága.

A light Feld game.

Every turn you will have 3 cards and must use them all. One card will be for thing I (giving you a special power), thing II (giving you a cube for building), and thing III (increasing the value of an animal). You will also spend cubes to put a guy on the board. Once you've completely surrounded a space, you get the animal token there.

At the end of the game, you score points based on the value of the animal (determined purely by what the players raised the value of) and a bonus for each set of 5 unique animals.

So you get some cards and you pick one to play in each different phase; depending on the phase you use, it has a different effect. That's a neat idea. The game in which it's put to work in about surrounding spaces on the board and set collection and isn't terribly exciting to me, but it is at least a little cute. (1 play)

Nice mechanics with the three cards you work with in every round. Not too complicated.

I like the different topic (selecting animals in the wildernis) towards all these many, many games where you build castels, kingdoms etc. And select goods and for trade. 

A minus: the artwork colourwise: yellow and "white" are under certain lamplight condtitions difficult to distiguish. Aswell as "grey" can easily be taken as "brown".

Also the cardholders confuse - especially when you first play this game. The upper area with the slots would be better an item of its own. The down area with the action phases would be much better as a small board of its own, maybe with an area to place the your recources and explorers. - Wonder of Alea eventually will work on this in a later edition.

So I've just rated it up for what I mentioned at the top. But for the lacks in colour and equipment no top rating.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (May 2015)

I really didn’t want to play La Isla as many friends told me it was a very light Feld, but I found this is not the case. It is true the rules complexity is low and the playtime is also low, however, the decisions needed in the game are far from obvious and you really need to think where to play the cards and your explorers. To clarify the decisions aren’t really hard but you have to think them through.

The fact that La Isla plays so quickly leaves me very satisfied with the depth of the game.

The components and art are great.

La Isla has a healthy dose of luck, I need to play more times to see if this really bothers me or not. I’m worried about the power level of the cards, some of them seem very powerful (the ones that let you score in phase B) and it is pure luck if you get one or not.

For me it isn’t a family game (I can’t play La Isla with my mom), it is a light-medium strategy game (a light game for me would be Coup, Spyfall, Timeline, etc.)

Bottom line, a good light-medium game. For now it is a borderline 7.0 and I want to play it again soon.

Draw three cards, then select which one will become one of your three bonus actions, which one you will tap for a resource, and which animal token you'll get points for… all while, for third action, moving your explorer and trying to nab one of those animals. It's a fairly simple mechanic to grasp, and there isn't too much of a brain strain to play it, which makes it an easier game from Ravensburg, but it's enjoyable nevertheless. Plus, the box says you only need three brains (I kid you not!).

PLUS: easy to grasp, quick and fluid play

RATING: 6
First off, this game has one of the coolest puzzle assembly game boards I've come across, creating a randomized relationship of board elements for every game! Also board tokens are randomly distributed and every turn you draw three random cards to determine your action choices. While randomizing the board and tokens is cool, the luck inherent in the card draw sort of negates the impact of randomizing everything else. In short, while slight details change (go for this token vs. that, or this resource vs. that) it doesn't change your strategic approach and only enhances replayability in minor ways.

The game comes with a fat deck of 180 cards. Each card does three things: gives you a special ability, gives you a resource, or enhances the point value of a token. On your turn you draw three cards and decide which card will be used for which thing. Additionally, you pay two matching resources to place on of your guys on a matching color space. If you surround a token with your pieces, you claim it and get immediate points for the space. At the end of the game you score the points for the tokens you've collected and any sets you've managed to build. You can have up to 3 special abilities in play at time and these do things like let you place your pieces more cheaply or gain resources, points, or increase token values when making certain placements. Ideally you want to build some complementary combos with your special abilities. 

The game is fine and about the right length. There is some control, but it is limited and you can easily become frustrated with your draws. I'd play this if it was offered up, but I don't think I need to own it.

RATING: 7
This is fairly typical of a Feld game, but lighter than expected. At this time, I have only played 2-player and the competition for capturing animals was light. Unlike other Feld's that play very consistently across the player counts, I suspect this one will be tighter and more competitive at 3 and 4 players. Still, a fun, light, quick, but still thinky game.

Played Oct 2014

I didn't enjoy the randomness of the cards. You can really get lucky and draw useful stuff, or the other thing. Setting up combos with your powers is fun. Often there isn't tension in choosing which cards to play where, either it's an easy choice and your happy, or it's an easy choice and you're frustrated. Perfectly fine light game which plays fast, but largely unremarkable.

----------------------------------------------

Read rules Sept 2014

I'm a big Feld fan, although some his designs are not for me, I usually enjoy his games. La Isla looks like a game I will like. It has multi-use cards which give you special powers, earn you resources, and score you points. It also uses simultaneous selection, a mechanic that I often enjoy. Each round players draw 3 cards and must allocate each card for one of its 3 uses, each use gets one card. This is done secretly. Then cards are resolved in turn order.

The other part of the game has a map of the jungle where players battle for area control. Players deploy explorers to surround jungle spaces in order to collect animal tokens. These tokens score at the end of the game, but for them to be worth points someone has to play cards that advance that animal on its track. To deploy explorers you need resources that match the terrain they are being deployed to.

The game has some solid design elements: competing interests, inability to do everything you want, and player interaction on the board as well as advancing animals that others may be collecting. As far as Alea Feld games go this is on the lighter side. Much lighter than last year's Bora Bora or 2011's Castles of Burgundy. I would say this is similar to Notre Dame or Rialto in terms of weight.

Somehow this game feels like less than the sum of its parts. Obviously 7 is not a low rating, but... multi-use cards, special abilities, programming, modular board, set collection, 1-hour, mid-weight, Stefan Feld... it has so many of the right ingredients. But it leaves me not particularly excited about playing again.

One niggle that should be mentioned is the colour issues. My wife is not colourblind but she has a really hard time distinguishing the colours of the cubes vs how they appear on the board vs how they appear on the cards.

RATING: 5
Down there with the weakest Felds. Get those VP bonus cards early or lose. Get the right starting animal that for whatever reason gets pushed more by other players than the other animals. Otherwise, it's multiple small races for getting the animals first while hopefully getting the right resources. Too much of a crapshoot in a package claiming something else. 
Alea sets a new standard for cost-efficient production by using material of a low quality unimaginable before for a game coming from a Ravensburger company. After playing I cancelled my yet undelivered order.

Reasonably simple and quick for a Feld, but not necessarily very compelling. The theme doesn't really make any sense at all, but once you realize that it's all about killing rare species rather than observing/studying them, not only is the game more enjoyable, but it all flows a lot better.

I wouldn't necessarily reach for this very often, but I would like to revisit it with my kids.

It's surprising how many tough decisions Feld managed to cram into this little box. Also it's one of his more focused games and no point salad game like most of his creations which may be helpful for some people. The mechanism where you put cards into a sheath each round to earn permanent bonussed (until you're forced to replace them) is also a very neat and seemingly innovative feature.

Pretty disappointing. Even when you're drawing three cards every turn, it's still quite a card lottery. Also, the positioning of the explorers can lead to solitaire experience if played fluently. The core system of card division is nice, though. Technically I also like the multifunctional cards and the inevitable ending.

This one's a keeper. Nice mix of special abilities, worker-placement, set-collection, and resource collection. You draw three cards each turn and have to make tough decisions about which card to use for resource gathering, which to use for an ability, and which to use for advancing your long-term point-multiplier. There's a lot of simultaneous action, so the game plays quickly. Reminds me a little of [thing=40628][/thing] but has more going on.

Fun and light game that works well at all player counts.  However, the scoreboard is ridiculously thin and cheap (the publisher should be embarrassed) and while the card holders work, they are flimsy, marginal and likely to get squashed in the box.  I wonder if a thick cardboard strip (like the tiles of the board, not like the scoreboard) would be better.

Usually willing to play and may consider purchasing despite the cheap scoreboard.

I love this game.  It is just deep enough to be middle weight, but still has tons of great choices.

I really would like to love it and tried it a dozen times. The mechanisms theirselfs are great, but in the end it is just stupid and mean luck, what can leave you really unsatisfied... (for example, if you just don't draw cards for (extra-)scoring your animal(s) and your enemy even draws the super cards early in the game, which gives you permanently 4 cards/4 slots, and you don't, you are just f***** up). Maybe with some draft mechanic variant you could solve this problem and make this game really great and tactical.

Good one - much better than it sound. Feld knows how to make these a bit lighter games (this, Rialto, Rum & Pirates) - I think I like these better than the heavier point-salad-games he has made. La Isla mix nicely limited hand management & luck - and still there is some competition going on. Components... well those are Alea standard, which means that they are far from great.

The idea is not bad. But the same problem that I have with Bruges is present here as well. With the (too) many card types it is easy to get behind without being able to do anything about it (believe it or not, I did not draw cards that would allow me to get any extra cube or place an explorer with only one cube until 70% into the game; in the same game for the fisrt (quite) few rounds I did not draw any cards that fit my animal tiles either). If a game needs you to combine and optimize, this luck level is unforgivable for me; also it makes the win less of an accomplishment.

This is a cute game with a pasted-on theme.  The game recommends the "easy" version first (just using less advanced cards) but at that point it's barely a game.  I'd go right for the advanced version, as this is a light game as-is.  Similar to La Granja in that you're deciding which part of a card you'll use for each card, but not nearly as difficult to make those decisions.

I've got to admit that my initial reaction to seeing the board layout was not favorable: all the colors and tokens and plastic figures seems so... busy.  After playing, Feld's myriad puzzles soon revealed themselves. I liked the anguish of choosing which cards to cover up in your tableau and finding an optimum placement of figures on the board. There's some clever stuff in this game.

Rules Summary

RATING: 5
I just wasn't a fan of this game.  There are some good mechanics here, but some of the symbolism frustrated me beyond game enjoyment.  Each turn you take three cards and after reviewing them, you place them face down in the A, B, C, D sleeve in front of you.  Each card has three items pictured on it; a special ability at the top, a specified color resource cube at the bottom left and an animal at the bottom right.  The card you put in your 'A' slot utilizes the ability and ignores the other two pictures.  The card you put in your 'B' slot and the card you put in your 'D' slot moves the peg up one spot on the animal track (of that animal on your card...the animal track features five different animals).

The A and B cards are played simultaneously by all players.  Turn order only applies to the C action which is spending two like cubes and moving an explorer to a space on the map.  There are several animal tokens on the map and you have to place your explorers (one per turn) around a token to secure it for points.  My biggest hang-up with this game are those symbols at the top of the cards for the 'A' action.  There are a ton of them that can provide a number of abilities ranging from getting immediate victory points to being able to place an explorer for one less cube.  The problem is how many symbols there are and trying to decipher them.  

There are quick-reference cards to refer to, but the print and the pictures are so small that it took me longer than my La Isla counterparts probably liked.  Some symbols are quite similar so I easily mistook one for another, but not after going cross-eyed trying to read what they meant.  It was a frustrating experience if nothing else.  I'd be up for playing it again, but there are so many other titles I'd like to visit and re-visit before coming back to La Isla.

Super abstract! Quick and fun to play. Don't rules lawyer the thing, sheesh. Resolve all abilities in yer favor, no problems.

Lost! by 3, was about to complete 2nd set next turn, and massive earnings, had 5 ability cards (yes, 5, not 3), with a big win well over 10+ points... the end game snuck up on me (us). Lost, holly carp. It was worse even than this report speaks to; I can't go on.

Raising rating from '7' to '8'.

[Update Feb 1:] Nah, lowered from 8 to 7. The bits are such sh*t it's amazing. My red card holder no longer can fit the cards, so I have to manually force in every A card (the center slot is the worst). The stupid small score board is an affront - 2 people have the same score? trouble; 3+ people? the f*g explorers fall off the table! Grrrrrrr. Now that we've taken it out of the regular rotation, maybe I won't miss it as much as I imagined I would? Oh, and don't even get me started on the small box which I have to jig-rig every time we play to fit everything back in. I can't even fit a tiny plano box in there with the 5 goods cubes (which for all intents and purposes are 5 of the same f*g color). The more I think about it the more I realize how much this production is an affront - not worth the money.

Probably my favorite Feld (despite another being rated higher somehow), La Isla is Point Salad: Endangered Species Edition. Though, it is really one of the most limited Feld games in terms of the actions you can take and ways that you score points. I love cards that can be used in multiple ways, and La Isla is one of the best representations of that mechanism. I don't think I can come up with a single complaint about this game. Except that it occasionally ends too soon, but that's kind of an inherent trait of a game like this.

I'm a recovering Stefan Feld addict: After loving all his games, I started souring on his designs in 2013, and I haven't liked one of his games since Bora Bora.

At the same time, La Isla seemed a departure from this most recent designs. It's a lighter game with just a few concrete ways of scoring points. It was worth a try.

I got to play it twice and I was pleasantly surprised. It ended up being one of my favorite new-to-me games. It plays in 45 minutes with 4 players, and plays feel reasonably different depending on the cards you end up with (make sure to include the level 2 cards from the start). It's mostly multiplayer solitaire, although there's a little bit of player interaction as far as taking animals from each other or piggy-backing on the animal stock market.

Even so, it was a quick, satisfying experience. I'd play it again for sure.

I really like how the pieces fit together to create the board.  Interesting tactical and strategic decisions to make.  Tactical = deciding what to do with each of your three cards each turn.  Strategic = deciding on which animals to get, and whether to go for sets or focus on one particular animal.  Seems to work a bit better with more players.

La Isla is a light board game where you get a hand of three cards.  Each card has three unique functions and you have to choose which function you will get that turn.  There are special abilities you get until the card is covered, you get resources, or score based on a type of animal you collect.  The last action is placing explores to surround animals and gather them up to score them or create sets.  The more animals gathered the more points they are worth at the end of the game if players advance the scoring on the animal track.  

It is abstract but surprisingly fun. I did not think I would like the game but I did.

Takes about an hour to play.  The only downside is the iconography was confusing.  It needs a download from the geek.

Not a bad game at all and it plays pretty fast once you learn the cards/icons. I do see it getting lots of play but I enjoy heavier Feld games. 

Instructions: Not bad but the text is really small. Multiple instructions for other languages.

Player Aids: Not good at all. Text is small and hard to read. Multiple language versions but only one for each language which makes it difficult when first learning.

Board: Nice board pieces and many combinations to ensure the game stays fresh. The one thing I did not like was when you put the board together it can be easily messed up if bumped.

Player mat/score track: Pretty crappy, flimsy stock that could be easily torn if you tried. If you have kids/small children beware. 

Cards: Small but easy to read and understand. Take Fantasy Flight Red Sleeves.

Meeples ect: Investigators are standard cheep plastic. Resources are standard colored wood. Nothing special.

Jede Runde besteht aus einer Karten- und einer Aktionsphase. Man zieht drei verdeckte Karten und überlegt sich, welche Karte man für welche Funktion nutzen möchte und ordnet sie verdeckt zu. 
Sind die drei Karten zugeteilt, kommt es zur Aktionsphase. Die Spieler machen Sonderfunktionen nutzbar, nehmen sich ihre Spielsteine und bewegen (am Ende des Zugs) die Marker. 
Die 4. Aktion, das Setzen von Forschern auf dem Urwald-Spielbrett zwecks Einkreisung der Tiere, ist am interessantesten. Je nach Position der Tiere werden zwei bis vier Forscher benötigt, um die Tiere einzukreisen, also einzufangen und damit Siegpunkte zu erhalten.

[thing=15033][/thing] was a game that I liked very much, and this goes in the same direction, but it's even simpler and makes use of cards. 

Very un-feldian simple game. It feels more like a [person=2][/person] game. 

Plays fast, decisions are not too difficult to make and lots of interaction with other players trying to outsmart you. That is also a bit of a downside of the game. When 1 person is left unbothered (in 3 player game), he will probably be the winner.

Some might say this is "My First Feld" and there's some truth to that title.

Insane amount of variability.  Lots of ways into thinking how to "catch 'em all."  Or at least catch the ones you want.  

Not a "point-salad" though there are multiple sources of points -- some "market manipulation."

Slick and well-oiled.  Tactics over long-term strategy but planning is still there.  

Nice goals and special powers/slight-engine building.

Components mostly nice though the game could use a scoring card for each player.

I like it.

RATING: 5
This feels very much like a wasted opportunity, since the optimization puzzle of distributing your card hand to the different action spaces is well done, especially when coupled with the choice of which persistent ability you want to keep. Cute graphics and a quirky theme that does not clash too much with the mechanics also help matters.

However, both the production and the balance of the game left me unimpressed. The first is a rather obvious flaw after a single glance at the flimsy, tiny overview cards, the second I’m less sure about, since I’ve only played a single game. However, that game was enough of a sour experience to prevent any realistical chance of a second go. I knew after a mere third of the game that I would place last, which would be bad enough. I also felt that this was less due to my inexperience, and more due to more lucky card draws of a played that contested and won a couple of crucial animals.

From this limited perspective, I’m afraid that La Isla combines big lucky swings with a very substantial runaway leader problem, and thus suspect that the good ideas that the design undoubtedly has will not gel into a satisfying whole due to a lack of development that is rather astonishing for an Alea game.

RATING: 7
Fun game that is not as light as I would have thought based upon other reviews and that is a good thing. I  was concerned La Isla was going to be too easy. There are plenty of decisions and tactics to consider. Has a nice smooth game play similar to Castles of Burgundy where each turn you have a few predefined actions to take and with thought, actions can chain together into combos all of which increase points. There are no negative effects in this game. A happy theme of saving near extinct creatures. I had to get it because it has a Dodo bird! :)

FUN: there's a lot to consider, even though you only assign 3 cards in your hand to each of the three available actions in a round. 

UNIQUE: a Feld game that's focused.

NEGATIVES: the luck of the draw can be a little too much sometimes, especially near the end.

We enjoyed it much more than I thought we would. Mediocre production values do not bother me because of the low price, it is fair. Luck plays a certain role which is no problem for us. Setting up a certain production chain and having to adapt it to the card-draw or to the changing situation on the board is fun. Recommended with 3 or 4 players.

I really like this game. Its built from a modular board, it's part set collection, mixed with different mechanics. I like that the game has a timer built into the game based on players collecting a certain number of animals. 

The scoring mechanics in the game are pretty cool. I was very pleasantly surprised with this game.

RATING: 6.5
Rather cheaply produced but okay for its price (around 20€ at Essen). What held us back from getting it was the movement of the explorers, which felt very scripted when maximised for animals. With 2P I can see both players just sticking to their side of the island, while actively avoiding each other. 4P was tighter but all the players just placed their explorers in their "quarter" in a big "V", like two hands of a clock and moved kind of clockwise from there. The multi-use cards were kind of interesting but not enough to mitigate this problem.

Surrounding animals to catch them, using a smart action programming system through cardplay. Three cards each turn, assign them to your a,b, or D action, looking for combo's. A lighter Feld, but smooth playing, I quite liked my plays so far.

Very fun game with a good combination of luck and skill, a very nice theme, and simple and sensible mechanics. A very elegant game that is executed very well. I'm guessing the low rating might be because there is a decent amount of randomness in the game (this isn't chess) so that the best player may not always win, but I don't think there's anything wrong with that.

A light engine building game.  What I really like about this game is you build your engine with an A card you play every turn, however you can only keep 3 A cards, after that you are forced to cover up an A card every turn. This forces players to rethink their engine and improvise every turn.  Very fun, and quick.

La Isla is a lovely little puzzle game about scientists on an uncharted island and paying resources to stake out prime camping sites so they can surround and beat to death cute, previously unidentified native critters. In other words, it's exactly like Nexus Ops except for the aliens, warfare, weird terrain, objectives, dice...and of course fun, the mystery ingredient that Eurogame designers have yet to get the hang of.

Once you figure out the iconography (two or three turns, maybe), the scoring system begins to make sense. Which doesn't make it any more fun, but at least you can subtract confused from the confused/bored/angry trifecta. Joy.

Das neue von Feld konnte mich im ersten Anlauf leider so gar nicht überzeugen. Nicht mein Spiel. Mit den Karten ist mir der Glücksfaktor ein wenig zu groß für meinen Geschmack und die teilweise recht unterschiedlichen starken Bonusaktionen verstärken dieses Gefühl noch.

RATING: 7
Feld makes a more family style game and it's quite enjoyable. Each turn you're given 3 cards and then you choose 1 card to use it's power, 1 to gain a resource cube and 1 to move an animal up the track. Then players use their resource cubes to place onto the board (using or triggering powers if possible). Players gain points for moving animals up the track and for capturing animals by surrounding them on the board. At the end of the game additional points are rewarded for each of your animals and their track position (so there's a bit of a stock game going on too).

Light, cute. Typical combo-y Feld but in a short-term way. How long do I need this power or this combo? How quickly do I move on to a different area of the board or a different point source? Feels less salad-y than most of his games and plays faster. Very good. Replayability is questionable, but I'll worry about that another day.

Super light Feld.  My kids actually enjoy this one which is a plus.  Usually I love Feld because of his deep gameplay and I can see past the thin theming.  Because this one is so light I admit that it has more staying power and popularity because of the "Feld" name instead of pure gameplay.

Lightweight Feld game in which you need to put 3 cards in the most optimal order and move your explorers around the island to collect extinct animals. The good thing is that everyone can play at the same time, with only phase C being played in order, so the downtime is reduced between turns. Already plays well with 2 players but 3 or 4 players is more challenging as the island gets really crowded then. 

The only negative point I have are the components for keeping track of the scores and the animals: these could have been made of thicker cardboard. Highly recommended relatively lightweight family game from Feld! A bit atypical as a Feld game but maybe one that clearly indicates the diversity of his mastership

RATING: 5
A light but interesting little puzzle that revolves around playing multi-use cards to help you pick up knowledge about rare species found on a small island. Players will assign three cards every round to different utilization slots, picking up powers, resources, and deploying scientists into the field to try and surround species that will then be picked up for points. The most compelling aspect of the game is finding synergies between powers and matching up available resources with the situation on the board, which is modular and changes every game. Still, it's kind of a one trick pony and may outlast it's welcome by about 15 minutes. Will keep it in my collection as a gateway game and something I think my son will like to try in a few years.

An interesting stock-market/area control/hand management game, quite colourful to look at though the theme is pasted-on--it would have been nice, and really pushed the game to another level, if the animals you're capturing have different characteristics that affect gameplay rather than just being arbitrary values on the zoological stock market. The game doesn't excite me but it's a typically solid Feld design. I like stock-market games (Mombasa, Navegador, most Lacerda games) because of the way they require you to benefit other players in order to benefit yourself, and force you to weigh the advantages and disadvantages of doing that. (My impression with La Isla after a few plays is that specialization is the way to go: maxing out one or two animals if people let you; set-collecting is a fixed 10 points per set of 5, while boosting and collecting a single animal has no absolute cap.)

UPDATE: Boosting the rating a bit--the randomness is a bit frustrating at times, but I love the puzzle presented every turn by the hand you're dealt, and really if you're playing well you are taking random draws into account (by investing in cards that help you get or save cubes). It feels good when you work out a good combo or snatch a beastie away from another player. (It's not a super interactive game but it has its moments.....)

NOTE: Even by Ravensburger's wretched standards the production quality on this one is amazingly shoddy--the flimsiest card stock imaginable. It's a huge shame.

As expected a little light for my tastes. Picked ip my copy secondhand for £10, if i payed more i would have been disappointed for this game.. Its a cute game.. But to luck of the drawn driven with experienced tabletop gamers.. There are tactical decision to be made each turn but your options are minamal.. I can see the game may be more interesting with more players as a two player there is very little interaction which I wouldn't mind usaly with a feld game but with not so much to think about it needs that tension.. My final negative is the is a lot of fiddling with this game for how light it is.. I ussaly like the phydical element of hands on with game components but as the game is so light and speedy you spend most oc your picking up and putting similar coured cubes..

A family friendly Feld design where you collect animals on an island, scoring for sets of animals at the end of the game. I like the fact that each card has three actions and you assign the cards at the start of each round.
The game plays quickly and the iconography is easy to understand. There is sufficient depth to work as a filler or lighter game for the hardened gamer.

Wasn't really enough interaction for my liking. I'm finding that I like my Euros to have more interaction.

I like the idea of cards with different effects depending on how you play them as well as the idea of surrounding areas on a board.

A Stefan Feld game where players put down explorers on a map to capture animals. You play cards first which will give you bonuses, a resource you want to get, then a multiplier for the animals. You then either place an explorer or get a good. To capture an animal, you have to surround it with your explorers. 

It's an okay game, with lots of possibilities, but it is lighter than what you expect from a Feld game. There is luck in the cards, and luck in how much conflict you get with the other people. It's fun, and I'm looking forward to trying the advanced game.

Elegance in simplicity. 3 cards each turn. Each card can be used in 3 ways.  

Fun with only two players, but the more the merrier as it changes the game where you race for control. With only two players, you pretty much stay out of the way from the other player.

The board looks beautiful, the species look beautiful, each game setup is variable and random.

I also love the "stock market" effect where you raise the end game value of certain species that you collect. It adds another level of depth in a fairly simple game that you have to pay attention to.

Nicely designed game of card combos and spatial control. Place hunters at places around the map to capture animals and score points. Placement requires resources that need to be managed by cards played. First Feld game I played. 

PROS
-Variable board set up, nice art and components. 

CONS
-Not very exciting or immersive game. 
-Card combos based on luck of the draw.
-Too long for a such a simple game. 
-End scoring changes rank and winner vastly; keeping score during the game seems pointless.

It's Feld, it physically looks like point salad, but it is not (yes, it shares many other characteristics: many paths to victory, predominance of mechanics over theme, etc.).

It's an area control/enclosure game, but the star is clearly the card mechanics. Each cards have three aspects, you draw three cards each turn, and use each one of them for each of the three aspects, trying to combo them and with 2 other cards you kept from past rounds, and also get actions interesting for your global strategy. That's no small feat!

It plays really fast, the advertised playing time is 60 minutes, but I think it can be played in less 50 minutes.

My first game has been a bit dissapointing, it seemed like the straightforward strategy was the best by far. I don't think Feld would publish a game with this flaw, but we will see with further plays.

[i]I ended up enjoying this game more than anyone else in my family so it didn't get as much play as I would have liked. However; after our last few plays I even started to feel like the game played out very similarly even using all the cards. I still think this is a great family game that introduces multi use cards, but it isn't very deep and even thought there are a lot of cards they are mostly variations on a few different concepts. I still would have kept it in our collection if my kids enjoyed the occasional play, but since they didn't I ended up trading it away. In the end it won't be a game that I regret trading as there are games that scratch a similar itch that I like much more (Fleet jumps to mind).[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]- Great family game with an awesome theme and a quick playtime.
- Plays great with 2 [i](we had quite a bit of interaction in our game)[/i].
- Interesting blend of mechanics that really work well as a whole.
- Art and components, specifically the artwork for the animals really stands out and the plastic scientists are a nice touch.
- Tough decisions when choosing cards since the can be used for multiple purposes.
- Combo building a nice set of powers to use during your turn, but because you can only have 3 powers active at once you constantly have to retool your strategy.[/i]

This game was proof that Stefan Feld needs to calm down with churning out games. As always, Feld makes a unique and beautiful board with a cute twist at the center of gameplay. And, as always, it has zero atmosphere with the theme tacked on. It's a harmless, little hand-management game, racing towards the end for the most points. But I could care less to play this again. It wasn't as exciting as I thought exploring an uninhabited island would be. *shoulder shrug* Meh.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It's very Euro-y, but it's saved somewhat for me by the ability to build a hand of powers that complement each other and give you something to strive towards. Ideal is when those powers complement your natural next steps on the board where you're moving your meeples around to get points and animals. Each turn provides a nice challenge re the three cards you get - which to keep for its power, which to use for its resource, and which to progress the animal track - as often you'll want one card to do multiple, but it can't. And sometimes turns are just a bust, and you hope you have a combo already in play that you can use to compensate. You use the gained resources to put meeples out to gain animals, each of which scores immediate points and also scores each time you advance its animal track. Specialisation in an animal is good, but isn't easy and comes at a price of having to move your meeples inefficiently, giving you choices to make. Although the game is essentially theme-less, turns are fast and interesting. There's enough mini-races for animals throughout to ratchet up some tension, but getting the most out of the card combos provide most interest. I'm not sure there's much to explore because the game is largely tactical and I'm not sure how much of your result is card-luck-driven, but none-the-less I'd happily play again to meet that card challenge once more.

A gateway Feld. Very mechanical in feel, yet the colors and graphics make it delightful. But, it is the special action combos that really make this game shine. Has much replayability. Lots of points. Set collection. Plays in less than an hour.

This has replaced Finca for us.

Like Alea's other Feld game, Castles of Burgundy, the production quality is less than the game deserves.

RATING: 7
In La Isla, players claim animal tokens by surrounding them with their scientist figures.  The animal tokens work a little like a stock market--players must bump the price of one animal every turn (depending on what cards they draw), and receive points for the number of that animal they have. At the end of the game, players get points for their collected animals according to their price, as well as a bonus for having sets of different animals.  The real interesting thing about this game, though, is the card play.  Players receive four multi-use cards each turn that they must assign to gaining resources (used to play scientists), playing a scientist in a specific spot, bumping an animal price, and gaining a special ability.  I really liked the special abilities, as they let me build interesting card combos.  This was a pretty light and easy game, but building card combos kept me engaged.

Game was a typical Feld points salad, however I like to play those games.  The rules and setup weren't too bad and the game played quickly.  I liked the indirect interaction of trying to capture animals or pushing the animal value markers.

The board construction was odd and the iconology seemed to be similar to Race for the Galaxy, which I thought was odd for a lighter game.

Light Feld.  I like the theme (which I've actually managed to reconcile with the gameplay). I like the mechanisms of hand management and using cards for multiple purposes. Thus, strangely, this is one of my prefered Feld games.  Possibly because it doesn't overstay its welcome, as some of his other titles seem to do.

I got to play this at my local meetup in a 4 player game. Since I brought the wife this meetup, I went with a lighter game and she is a fan of Feld. It went really well and my wife like it more than me. It's a neat game with area control (although you can't block people completely), card play like Bruges,  and set collection/stock market mechanisms.

It is light enough for a family game but to get over the hurdle of learning all the symbols will take time (like all Feld games).

Too bad this one plays best at more players than 2-players.

Much lighter and more luck dependant game then I'm used from Feld, but then again is a game in the small box - series of Alea. I think that a house rule were you get 4 (or 5 if you have the special power that gives you 1 more card) and discard a card make this a better game.

Played it twice; both times two players - works well.  The game is solid.  Wouldn't change much about the game except for 2 things: the choice of colours detracts from the game play, and the player boards are too flimsy. Wished the production was of a higher quality.

Every turn you draw three cards and figure out how to sequence them, which is a fun little puzzle.  There is little downtime because most of the decision-making is simultaneous, so the game seems to speed by.  Good fun.

This is a game where your card draws dictate what moves you are able to make, then you are expected to set up and execute board combos to snatch up sets of animal tokens by surrounding them. This doesn't work, because other players who got better draws, can sneak in and snatch away the tokens you were setting up for before you can get there. I went first and spent the whole game having other players snatch tokens out from under me after 2 turns of awkward setup. Super frustrating and I hope I don't have to play this again.

Sure, it's light and a bit silly, but La Isla is just plain good. There's actually plenty of strategy involved in planning each turn, even though you only get three random cards to work with. The randomness doesn't really matter though since three cards is effectively nine different choices to consider. It's definitely fun racing to capture the endangered critters. This is basically Feld Pokemon, with an interesting bit of forced semi-cooperation with the other players. La Isla is the perfect kind of light weight game, giving plenty of choices while still wrapping up in a relatively short time. Color me impressed!

It's like Gonzaga crossed with... You know, not every game has to be the baby of two others. Even though they all are. But let's forget about that, and the bizarre mix of nice/cheap components, using colors that are impossible to tell apart, and using cubes at all when you literally could have used anything else less generic... The game is really fun!  It doesn't feel like you're exploring at all (get Tikal or Costa Rica for that) so the little men you run around the board shouldn't be called explorers ("poacher" is so passe) but what you are doing is muscling your way through the jungle and elbowing your opponents out of the way. Setting up a successful combo is insanely satisfying and there's a lot of excitement around making the most of what you get each turn and seeing others do the same. 

All this is after only one game so see me in a few more to see if I still feel the same way, but it made one heck of a positive first impression on me. Also, I got to use two parenthetical asides in the same sentence for this comment and that's worth an "8" score all by itself.

La Isla feels like the perfect gateway game, for all ages. It provides just the right balance of control vs luck to satisfy both inexperienced players and fans of heavier games - as despite what some reviews might say, it's not as luck driven as might first appear... in that respect it achieves to bring a play experience that Bruges (a game that offers many choices, but ultimately that matter little) can only dream to deliver.

My only complain about La Isla, besides the annoying beige/yellow icons difficulty to tell apart, is that with more players, the animal multiplier board is highly chaotic, and this combined with the competition on the isle (if people choose not to stick to their corners) are likely to kingmake one of the player, due to real fault of the people taking part... but as long as you go in knowing this is mostly a tactical affair then it still is a seducing offering, that is not overly-long.

27-01-2015. Rated after 2 plays. La Isla is Stefan Feld's latest lighter game. In the game you try to hunt/kill all kinds of extinct animals (try to get tiles). Via some kind of stock-market system, all these animal tile acquire a point value. The game ends when the combined value of the animals reaches a certain point depending on the number of players.

Each turn, you get and play 3 cards, face down in front of 3 slots. Each of these cards have 3 things to note. One of them is a special ability listed in the top half. Second, in the left corner is a resource and third is an animal who's value you can increase. 

In phase A of the turn, you turn over the card in front of A, put it in your player sheet and get the special ability until another card is put in it's place. You can have 3 special abilities at any time (unless you have a card that allows you a 4th).
In phase B you get a resource of the color listed in the bottom-left corner.
In phase D you increase the value of one animal tiles. If you increase the value of an animal that you have, even if this happens during the other phases of the game you immediately get a number of points equal to the number of animal tiles you have of the animal who's value you raised.

In phase C, the magic happens. You can put explorers on fields surrounding animal tiles by paying two cubes of the same color as the field. If you at one time fully surround one of the animal tiles with 2, 3 or 4 explorers, you get the tile and immediately get the number of points listed on the tile (which is equal to the number of explorers needed to capture the animal tile)

Endscoring is simple, you get 10 Vps for each complete set of animals and subsequently get 1 VP for each 2 resource cubes you have left. Lastly, you get points for each animal tile, equal to the value on the stock market.

I liked this game more than Castles of Burgundy, the other Feld game I've played. This game is considerably lighter, but also has a colorful look and nicer components. The card 'programming' (?) is nice too, and it feels a little less like scripted because you can get points for everything you do. I also liked that this game was more interactive than Castles of Burgundy, because you need time to get your explorers to places you need, so if you cut someone off.. Ultimately, the game was not a keeper for me. I don't see myself playing it in the future with 2, and will not hit the table with more players because I'd prefer more interactive games.

(18 plays)

One of my most played games of 2014.. That speaks for itself I think. Two complaints are that it brings way too many beginner cards n not enough of the advanced and I think the player aids shouldve been better, way to small for a game with so much iconography. The explorers feel a bit cheap but I think they work fine with the board, size wise. I take a point off because of these issues, gameplay is amazing though. Really love the puzzle of combining your cards the best way possible in every round. Also the animal tracker is very cool.. Constantly raising value for the animals that you're catching, while at the same time having to keep an eye on not benefiting your opponents. This game just makes me happy when I play it, and although I admit that there are better games in my collection, this one just gives me a special feeling. 

Update: Try playing it with variant of using three tokens (could be whatever extra pieces you want to use) so that you can use em a la Ginkgopolis and everytime you're unhappy with your current hand, use one to draw new cards. For every token that you still have at the end of the game, you get two vp's. I got that from another Geek that suggested it a while back.

Update: Three years later and it still fires on all cylinders for me. A new player that I showed it to loved it, which is always a great feeling. I gotta say though, this game shines with 4 playes. It is a good 2 player game, very good at 3, but with 4, the design comes alive.

RATING: 6.5
Played once with 3P. A Feld design on the lighter end of the spectrum, La Isla feels a little like [thing=136888][/thing]-lite in a sense that both games centre around cards which can be played for different attributes. The difference in La Isla is each specific attribute [i]must[/i] be used exactly once per round, so players need to allocate their cards accordingly. There is a noticeable luck factor because it is very possible that you draw a junk hand, or that your hand falls into plan neatly, but that's just how the game rolls. 

There is some minor interaction here, as you generally want to avoid placing explorers too close to the explorers of your opponent on your right, just in case she decides to go after the same animals that you do. Also, the way the board is designed to place explorers is rather clever, although there is a heavy bias to keep the explorers moving in a windmill manner around the board.

My main concern is that the game plays a little long for the depth it offers. The sense of development plateaus halfway through the game, which is when the rounds feel repetitive with little sense of achievement. The game is also weak components-wise, and it would have been nice if the card holders were sturdier. But overall I am in the minority who thinks that La Isla is one of Feld's better recent designs, and a smidgen better then Bruges – there are fewer plates to keep spinning, and the card combos are tamer. It still does not have the staying power of his other games though. And surely I can't be the only one humming the Jurassic Park theme song when playing this?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.25
La Isla is a light euro game where each turn the players have to decide which of three different ways the cards are going to be used, and how they will use workers placed on the modular board to capture tokens and score points at the end of the game.

OK Feld tactical filler with a very busy-looking board. Players are trying to ensure animals in a jungle. This is done by playing 3 action cards to get actions/bonuses, resources and to trigger scoring.

Meeple Placement to surround and capture animals for VPs caps it off.

The game can bog down with players who want to maximize every move and card. Not terrible but not stellar either.

Bought this when we were visiting family pretty much just to have something to play with people while we were there. I had written it off earlier simply because it's a Feld (whose designs I generally hate), but this is actually pretty fun. We've played 2-4, and each count feels different, though none is necessarily best. Simultaneous action selection keeps things moving. In 4-player, it is possible (quite likely) for the first player to start to get squeezed on both sides (on the board), at which point it's almost impossible to do well. There is a luck element (especially 4p), but it's not too bad.

Feld egyik új játéka nagyon meglepett, mert amennyire jó a kártyamechanizmus benne, annyira szerencsefüggő, cserében 1 órás. Három kártyát kapunk körönként, amiknek kártyánként három tulajdonsága van. El kell dönteni mindháromról, hogy melyik részét használjuk. Ezen túl egy kis táblán vadászunk állatokra és pontokra, illetve egy sávon növeljük ezen állatok pontértékét, amit játék közben és a végén is elszámolunk annyiszor, ahány állatot tudunk belőle a játék közben szerezni. 5 perc alatt elmondható szabály, 1 órás játékidő, de erős szerencsefaktor.

Right now one of my favorites.  I like the mechanics in this game - having 3 active actions (and having to decide which to replace) and having multiple ways to score.  Game play is fast.  Is intimidating at first because of the iconography on the cards, but once that makes sense it's very easy to see what's in front of you.  Unlike some commenters, I have not found luck to be nearly as important as strategizing the best way to maximize your cards.  Also, I'm a sucker for games with game boards that change each play (though the layout isn't particularly important).

[I don't agree with comments I'm seeing that this is a luck-heavy game.  It isn't.  There are multiple ways to earn victory points, and you should be able to maximize any hand you're dealt.  Also, the board is expansive, so there are ways to shift strategy based on your current action cards and hand.]

Quite clever, actually. It reminds me somewhat of Aton, in that you have a hand of cards and have to assign them to different abilities, except that in this case they either get you resources, provide a long-term ability, or change the endgame scoring. There's nice tension in getting the animals you need before other players and it's really fun chaining your cards together in various combinations. Overall, a fun package in an hour or less.

RATING: 9
A very simple mechanism (Play 3 cards in 3 slots) spiced up with bonus structures and many many options (cards with multiple uses) makes for a great strategy game that requires quite some thinking. 

The iconography isn't optimal. The playing aids are printed too small, the colors behind the animals on the "D" section of the cards are completely unnecessary and confusing.

A mechanically great Feld. (The theme is a bit strange but who cares.)

Played at Yucata.de

An interesting, light game of set-collection and hand management. Very tactical, since you have to deal with a new set of cards every turn and you can (normally) only have 3 active powers (after turn 3 you'll be replacing one every turn). Still, you need to have some loose strategy to most efficiently use your 5 workers. Little control due to the card cycling, but at least board play (worker positions) don't change so much so you can try to work towards specific targets -- feels less random and chaotic than Brugges, for example. 

Decent game, but too lightweight for me to play much (except online, anyway).

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
The board is a random configuration of tiles each surrounded by 2-4 worker placement areas and having a randomly placed token (5 types).

Each turn you get a set of 3 cards, each with 3 possible uses: allocate one card per use (special power, earn a resource, advance marker on game timer). 
- Special Power: stuff like getting bonus cubes, reducing cube cost, bonus VP, get a bonus slot for more powers, etc.
- Resource: one of 5 cube colors
- Timer: a separate board, with tracks for each of the 5 types of tokens. Each track separated into bands of value 0-5. When the sum of values reaches target (varies by player count), game ends.

After players allocate their cards, in turn order they spend 2 matching cubes to place (or move) one of their explorers onto the board. If you surround an area, earn VP (2-4) and take the token in that area. Alternatively, take any resource cube.

At the end of the game, earn bonus VP for having sets of the 5 tokens. Also, each token is worth 0-5 points (based on marker on the tracker board). Most VP wins.

This is very light for a Feld game.  I've played other light Feld games such as Builder's Duel and The Speicherstadt but for the most part his games tend to be meatier/deeper experiences.

In this game players draw 3 cards each turn.  Each card has 3 possible uses and players determine which card is going to be used for each of the three functions that turn.  One will be used to give the player a special ability, the other to get a resource, and the last to move an animal track marker up.  In between the second and last action players also put an explorer on a board in order to surround and collect animal tiles.  These tiles are the main source of points in the game.  The game lasts until the animal track markers are at a certain level and the player with the most points wins.

I typically really like the mechanic of cards being used for multiple different purposes and having to choose which role to fit each of your 3 cards in each turn presents a lot of opportunity cost decisions that make this game, despite being reasonably light, also reasonably deep and engaging.  There's a little bit of competition and reading your opponents as everyone is playing in the same space and especially with more players there can be competition for certain aspects of the game.  That said, the game is a lot more interesting with more players.  It is fine with 2, but each player can tend to focus on their own thing and there is less interaction.

The accessibility is a great boon for this game, this is a game that is quick to get up and running with almost anybody and because it is still reasonably engaging and deep you don't sacrifice that in making a lighter game.

Reasons I like this game:
-Very cool modular board is functional and beautiful.
-Unique theme integrates pretty well with mechanics. 
-Creative take on the 'multi use cards' (probably better than San Juan).
-Fast, simple gameplay; good tactics are essential.
-Awesome combos and player powers.
-Cute animals.

Reasons I hate this game:
-Sometimes you just never get the cards you want, or your opponent sets up a killer combo and rides it to the win.
-A little lacking in player interaction.
-Its probably too complex for a family game, and hardcore gamers may think its lacking...

TL;DR: A fast, fun, card driven euro-game with a unique theme. The best Feld game IMHO.

Desperately poor colour choices for the colour blind gamer. 

However even if not this was not a barrier to my playing the game it is just throw away Feld - little chainy actions and powers to achieve not very much. Its a n interesting theme (collecting, believed to be extinct ,animals) that is rendered to abstract euro soullessness by the usual combos of resource management and manipulation with special powers on cards.

Stefan Feld continues his exploration of multi-use cards. Players control explorers collecting animal tiles from a shared island board. Each round, they choose which of their cards will become a persistent bonus, which will provide a resource, and (most interestingly) which will affect the animal market, raising the value of collected animal tokens.

I wasn't expecting much from this one but it's surprisingly engaging, particularly when choice of a desired bonus or resource means raising the value of an animal type favoured by another player. Luck of the card draw seems significant -- it is difficult to reliably build synergies between bonus cards. 

This is highly provisional rating after one play; I expected to be one and done but this one needs additional exploration. It's elevated by the animal market but not sure there's enough to that to be worth the effort.

Very tactical, though you do have an overall strategy of concentrating on part of the board to use your explorers as efficiently as possible.  Aiming for full sets and focusing on a specific type of animal both seem to be viable.  Overall not my favourite Feld but it still has my interest at the moment.

Relaxing game with some interesting decisions going on. My biggest complaint is that it is a bit overly luck based for the animal scoring part. I think the game would be better if everyone drew 4 and played 3 from the start simply to mitigate luck a bit. Maybe some other method of scoring replacing the "get the right animal card on your turn" would improve it.

Having 5 or 6 of an animal and then never getting that animal despite drawing 5 cards a turn can really sour the experience which it did for me. Still a nice quick game though so it isn't bad, just could use some work on being even better.

Elegance in simplicity. 3 cards each turn. Each card can be used in 3 ways. 

Fun with only two players, but the more the merrier as it changes the game where you race for control. With only two players, you pretty much stay out of the way from the other player.

The board looks beautiful, the species look beautiful, each game setup is variable and random.

I also love the "stock market" effect where you raise the end game value of certain species that you collect. It adds another level of depth in a fairly simple game that you have to pay attention to.

Theme doesn't get me. While the game looks attractive, there is just placement, set collection coupled with weight adjustment. Done SO many times. There is not even a hidden weight adjustment. No interaction. Generic actions. No maneuvring.

Quite a bit of luck in this game, especially for a Feld. Yes, the cards have multiple uses, allowing you to mitigate some luck, but there are a few A abilities that can give a huge advantage if drawn early on, and if you go many rounds without being able to push your favored species while your opponents draw the right cards to push theirs, you can't really compete.  Still, it's fun, and I enjoy it.  It plays very quickly.  If it took much longer to play, however, I don't think I'd like it for the reasons I stated previously.

Not all Feld games are full fledged point salad heavy euros. And that's OK with me as long as he keeps on doing those :) La Isla is one of those other games. It's a very family friendly game. It plays well and has some nice opportunities for strategic or tactical play. There is a good chunk of luck in what cards you are dealt though. I just decided to max the track I had 2 creatures of at the start of the game and in doing so I won the game by a landslide. I'm not sure that means the game is broken, I guess I also was lucky with the cards I got, but I also was able to use them well, which I credit my flawless gaming abilities for. So it's a good combination of luck and strategy. It does what it sets out to do, but don't expect the full Fled experience.

RATING: 8
"The Feld game Feld fans don't like," was how it was described to me. The player aids are too small (but larger and brighter are available on the game page), the board colors don't match the cubes well, and at some point I want to look at the modular board pieces and see if I see a more straightforward cut. All that said, the game is quite playable.

An easy to learn and play point gathering game. Draw three 3-part cards and lay them in order: one becomes one of your three special powers, replacing a previous power; one lets you draw a cube of a particular color; (you then place or move a man using a pair of cubes); and advance one of the animal scoring tracks. Continue until the tracks advance enough to end the game (dependent on number of players). Good scope for different strategies, I think, though sets of each animal may be a little dominant.

Probably there's more theme to the game than I'm recalling; I was busy getting mechanics down.

La Isla is a frustrating title from a talented designer.  There are several different mechanisms to grasp here and they do not gel into a greater whole or even evoke jungle adventure.

I was hesitant about a "lighter Feld", but La Isla impressed. I always enjoy the mechanic where a card can be used in several different ways (as an action, to draw a resource, etc) and we picked up the rules very quickly.

La Isla is a very quick light game. You are scientists who have flown to an island where five extinct species have been rediscovered. You're trying to corner the animals to study them and whoever gets the most valuable knowledge at the end of the game wins.

Every round you get three cards. Each card can be used in one of three ways, as an ongoing special power, to get a cube of the shown color, or to push up the stock market value for the shown animal. And you must use all three cards in a different way. Additionally, on your turn you can put a guy on the board, and if you manage to corner an animal you take the chit and score some points. Every time you push up the stock market for an animal that you have, you get a point per animal of that type. And at the game end, you see where you've pushed the value of an animal to and score that per animal.

The main challenge is to figure out how to best allocate the cards you've been dealt. There's a bit of luck, as in any card game, but the game is quick and not too deep, so a little luck is okay.

RATING: 7.5
[thing=154246][/thing] is one of the lightest Feld game I remember have played. The only dificulty in the game is truly to get to know all the different effects of cards (but in our second game, which lasted around 40 minutes) we already knew almost all of them and used the player aid only to clear some doubts. In each round of the game you receive 3 cards, and you have to put one in the A spot, one in the B and one in the D. The A spot is for effects, so the card you put there will activate the special effect it has. In the B spot the card will give the player a resource in the color shown in the lower left corner. In the D spot, the card will advance the animal marker shown in the lower right corner - and the player will collect points equal to the amount of tokens he has of the animal just advanced (the starting token count as two tokens). In the C phase you don't use a card, instead you may put a scientist in the board, by paying resources of the type required by the spot you want to put it. You do this to collect more animal tokens, since once the token is surrounded by your scientists, you take the token to you. The tokens require from 2 to 4 scientists to be taken, which is shown in the board. Once the player takes the token he also scores the amount of points equal to the number of scientists required to study the animal (so, 2 to 4 points).

You advance animals in the track not only to get points in the moment, but also because the track for the animals has multipliers - from 1 to 5. Once the sum of mulipliers reach a certain threshold (9 for three players, 11 for four players) the game will end. Players will them score accordingly to the number of tokens they have for each animal multiplied by the number shown in the animal track. So, say, if the player has 3 Dodo tokens, and the Dodo marker is in the x3 in the track, the player will receive 9 points for the Dodo tokens. Also, for every set of 5 animals tokens the players has, he will receive 10 points. Finally, for every two resources, the player will get 1 point. The player with the most points, wins!

[thing=154246][/thing] showed itself as a fun and light game. The decisions are important, particularly which special ability to use, but they aren't really hard to make. The special ability is the hardest part not only because there are so many of them, but also because each turn you must put a new one in use, so you can't just put a combo working and milk it all the way to the game end. Every turn (starting from the 4th turn) you will have to cover an special ability you have, since every player only has space for three special abilities, therefore, once every place is occupied, you will have to cover something. There is one card that allows the player to have an extra space for special abilities, and this is a pretty good card to have in place, and you will have way more control and the possibility to make a stronger combo working for you. The decisions for resources and which animal to advance in the track are easier to make, but still require some thought as sometimes the best animal to rise is in the card that gives you the exact resource you need.

There is also an element of timming in [thing=154246][/thing], since you will be competing with the other players for the same tokens in the board. But this isn't too mean, at least in three players. In our plays, everyone took a place in the board to work pretty much for his own. This happens specially because every player can only put one scientists every round, so if a player already start working in a place, chances are that you, one round behind, won't be able to dispute the tokens - except in the central area of the board. But, as I saw, the biggest timming issue isn't the dispute in the board, but to be able to take tokens and score during the game in the amount of time the game gives you. Because in [thing=154246][/thing] the game end is always closer and closer, as is impossible to stall in the game - every round the animal markers will advance two, three or four steps (depending on the number of players). This is really important to be aware of, as if you don't you might lose the moment to complete a set of animals, to surround a token and/or to take a resource that will let you put an scientist in the proper place.

But [thing=154246][/thing] has one problem: the special abilities are wildly different, so much so that some are [u]way[/u] better than others. The biggest offender is a type of card is the one that lets the player advance an animal marker and score in phase B if the player took a type of resource. This is really powerful. In my first game, the only player with this sort of card won; in my second, two player have them, and they were first and second. So I found cards divided into good, medium and weak cards, and not "weak due to your strategy", but weak overall - cards you won't use more than once or twice, if this many. Sure, since you have to keep covering cards, this isn't such a bad thing. So if it wasn't for the card I mentioned, overall things would be ok in the good, medium and weak deparment.

The production value in [thing=154246][/thing] is good - colorful and well done. The art is fine, and the players "boards" are inventive (though it might be a problem to keep folding them everytime, and store them folded is, I think, out of the question). The board being made of separated parts works well to give the game even more replay value (already huge, considering the animals tokens are put random, and the amount of cards). Overall, approved. I will definitely play this more when the opportunities come.

Components only OK--some of them are nice, but point marker tokens are not included and have to be brought in from another game, some of the cardboard is nearly paper. But it was also inexpensive, so no problem, just noted. We had heard it was light, so we were a bit worried, but it's quite fun, a good addition to our growing Feld collection.

After a couple more plays: Yes, definitely light, kind of weird in a way, kind of clunky. But it's charming in a simple way. I'm going to lower it down to a 7, but I don't think it'll drop any lower than that. We like it, but nobody could really love it.

First play of La Isla with two is pleasant but dry. Each round moves along at a similar pace with similar a decision space: how to rearrange the cards and place an explorer. Players get multifunctional cards to assign different slots conveying different rewards or actions. With two, the game plays like a solitaire race to pick up groups of like-minded animals. Because the terrain is large, you can easily avoid conflict. There is nothing wrong with this familiar Feldian design, but it brings nothing fresh to the table. The ability to piece together the modular board is unique though. Special mention for the components: they are way subpar! This is shocking to me as I feel Ravensburger has generally done a good job with components and have been top notch. This is now the second game, after Orongo, that I am bummed about Ravensburger. The score track is paper thin, which is at least acceptable. Having only one set of summary sheet to share among all players is just wrong. This game is loaded with icons for the various powers and each player essentially needs a summary sheet. I am disappointed that Ravensburger couldn't place another few more sheets into the box. That's a shame.

Slightly underwhelmed.  It's a fine game, just lighter than I even thought.  I nice, little puzzle, but most of the decisions working out the cards were easy to make.  I did like the spatial element of the board, but it was also over surprisingly fast.  Kind of anticlimactic this kind of, "game ends when tracks are pushed up this much."

I liked it fine enough, I could see it being the kind of more entry level game that gamers would enjoy also.  A good Segway into heavier decision making.  Think it could really give some people the "itch". For me though, there are games with a similar feel in my collection that I'd rather play.  Namely Bruges and Blue Moon City.

Board play is simple. Cadrs with multiple uses is well executed. However, I felt that something was missing for this to be a very good game.

2.2 - Is fast and smooth. Fun when you accept cards not going your way. There is some strategy with explorer placement on the board and synergising card powers. Good for a lunch time game, and for the grandkids when they get older.

A surprisingly light new Feld. It plays rather fast and the rules are pretty easy and straightforward. But it's just that lightness that's so attractive in this game. Yet your decisions are still important and tactical. I definitly want to try this out more often.

RATING: 9
Pretty simple game, but it's just really fun to figure out what to do with your cards.
Also it's super-fast thanks to most of the game being simultaneous.
Because of the considerably big luck-factor, we play with a minor house rule, that everybody gets two tokens, that, when discarded, let you discard and draw a new hand. If you keep them you get a point at the end of the game though. I guess you could have even more of these tokens, or make them worth more points, the game is simple enough that it can work with many house rules.

Enjoyable light euro game with some cool twists in the mechanics. La Isla forces you to make some tough and choices by figuring out how to play the most effective card combinations each round. It may be a little too random at times, but it should work just fine as a simple family game.

Looks good, nice size box and plays well. Maybe a bit too long as a filler. Really like the use of the cards. There is push your luck in a controlled sort of way and some elements of union pacific where you try and increase the value of the creatures you hold, try and get some of the creatures that look like they may be worth more points. Maybe change to a 9 if I get chance to play again.

A somewhat charming light set collection sort of game.

But, the epitome of a themeless Euro.  It looks like a big math problem.

This is a Feld that doesn't grab me. Fwiw I do enjoy Burgundy, Trajan and even Rum & Pirates ;)

Another gem from the Master.
Small box, reduced number of components, just a handful of pages of rules... and so much depth that the agony begins on turn 1.
Well done.

Played just once online. It is not bad but it seems too chaotic and missing control completely on what you could do.
I need more plays to correctly evaluate this

[EDIT] the game is growing on me, there are hard decisions to make and it is possible to follow different strategies (the 5 animals set, the single animal specialist are the first two i see). I prefer the game with advanced cards

solid light game. Play's in around 45 minutes.
Set collection, using cards in 3 way's, one action to collect a recource, or to use it for it special ability and moving up the animal track to score points.
Rated high cause my daughter likes it very much

Very light for a (modern) Feld and doesn't grab me the way some of his other games do, but the card combos are still satisfying and, most importantly, it plays VERY FAST. 2p game in 30 minutes with this level of Euro goodness is a very rare find.

Looked simple after a video review and reading the rules, but when playing it it feels too overwhelming with all the possibilities of cards, actions, and places on the map. Just too much for my taste.

I feel this game played way too quickly -- I had my next 2-3 moves planned out but the end of the game triggered while half the board still had pieces on it.  While I do understand why it ends early with the way tokens are scored, I feel there could be a way to extend it without ruining the gameplay. Overall, relatively simple game that might be a half-step above "gateway" status.

Although the game is light (especially for a Feld game), it just clicks for us. Both times we sat down to play this game so far, we played multiple times. It is just that quick and fun.

Got it now for two years but never played it... I don't know what prevents me to play this game. It has an unusual board, nice little figures and I think a good mechanic, but something is withholding me... :D

When the name Stefan Feld shows up on a gamebox, the game automatically goes on our want-to-have-list. At least until the beginning of 2013 they did. Then we bought Rialto as an instant buy, just because of the name of the author of the game on the box. This game wasn’t a big success for the two of us. After that, Amerigo was released. Because of the high price, we didn’t buy it immediately. When we were able to try this one at the gaming club, it was another Feld game, that just didn’t work for us. We decided that we wouldn’t add this one to our collection. We became careful, when a new game by Feld was announced. I guess the production level of Mr. Feld became too high. Four big games in one year is a lot to design. When Aquasphere was announced in the beginning of 2014, we became interested. Slowly more and more information became available about this game, but it couldn’t convince us. Also La Isla was announced. This one interested us, as it looked like an ‘old-fashioned’ Feld game to us. After reading a couple of positive reviews, it was placed on our want-to-have-list. Picked this on up at Spiel 2014, and believe it or not, there was already a nice deal for this game. Just a couple of months on the market.

Back home, we couldn’t wait to get this one on the table. We watched a video. There were some ambiguities, but after reading the rules, everything was clear. The medium-Alea box, is filled completely with components, and after bagging all of them, it’s hard to get everything back inside the box. The biggest surprise might be the plastic explorer pawns. Surprising, because this is an Euro-game. I’m still not sure if I would prefer some wooden meeples instead of the plastic pawns, but the size of them is just right for the modular board. Played the game, and as usual for a Feld game, everything is good to get victory points. No straight strategy that will guarantee you to win the game. Still, for a Feld game, this is a very light game. Maybe too light for somebody who likes heavy weight games. We played our first game in less then an hour, and that was including setting up the game. A disappointment? No, not for us. It’s definitely not the best Feld game out there. If this one would be your first Feld game, then we wouldn’t recommend it. If you’re an Feld-addict, then you can’t go wrong with this one. Just add a nice and easy family game to your collection. The symbols on the upper half of the card, are sometimes hard to understand, but I it was necessary to make the game language independent. Luckily there are some player aids inside the box to clear these symbols up. Too bad, the only put one set inside the box, instead of four sets. It’s not Notre Dame or Macao, but for us, it is a big hit.

In reality, it's fairly abstract, but it plays really, really well, with lots of trade-off choices. The configurable decagonal board, combined with the 180-card deck and, you know, players' choices, provides plenty of variability from game to game.

There's a surprising level of thinkiness, and yet the game is approachable even to new players. It can be tough for them to wrap their brain around the symbology but they usually pick it up within a couple rounds. It's also usually possible for people to catch up on the score if they're paying attention.

RATING: 6
I’m still unsure about the game. I want to like it because it’s the sort of game I should like - and maybe I do - but there’s something that I can’t quite put my finger. Of Splotter's other games, I think the game is more like Indonesia in that one big play could swing the game one way or another. I’m not sure this is quite as significant as one merger in Indonesia can be but it’s of that ilk and maybe my reservations are something to do with the fact that you play for almost 3 hours with only 2 or 3 really big decisions - the decisions that decide the game - to be made, these decisions being when you decide to bail out of your company. Maybe this isn’t true because acquiring the asset cards (or possibly buying your own asset card) may be just as crucial and we don’t yet understand enough about good play to really appreciate it.

Fairly heavy, with a unique set of mechanics whereby players opt out of companies claiming a share of the profits. This game sits comfortably amongst the best stocks-and-shares games with a hint of 18XX about it. The theme is tongue-in-cheek, but very subtle, and the strategies are deep. This is a very intriguing game.

Strongly recommend playing with 4-5 players (8 rounds) instead of a threesome (12 rounds). The game will be shorter and you get more bidding action.

Very long, very tedious, heavy math game.  Worst part of game is it is possible to know your last couple of turns you know you won't be able to get victory points.  What do you do?  You can continue playing knowing it does nothing or just sit and watch.  Game needs major cleanup.

Hardcore economy game. I really like the theme of the game. This cynical and funny at times gameplay, matches exactly how capitalism works. Its all about money and prestige. Players are CEOs in various companies and using asset cards try to build up the companies only to crush them later, get fired and walk away with the money.
Rules are quite simple. The negatives are the huge playtime (First game took us 4 hours with 3 players) and the fact that the game is very mathy. I mean very very mathy. 
Its a unique memorable economy game

RATING: 5.5
An overly long game with interesting mechanisms, and far too broken to be worth the money - or the time.  Any game which can actually leave a player with nothing to do for over an hour other than wait for the end of the game is just poorly designed IMHO.  You'd have to go some in order to get me to bother playing this again.

My issue is not with the game but with the publisher's policy. I do not like the destination that the policy leads to. It leads to a flooding of bad games and good games with substandard production reaching higher prices. As a consumer i object to that scenario hence the rating.

While I enjoy the theme adn the interesting mechanics around getting paid for wrecking companies, I'm not sure that turning this into a race was the best of ideas.  There aren't very many turns and the scoring system is perhaps too chunky.  There are some good ideas here, but it doesn't quite come together.

After one play with three, got mixed impressions, not quite what I expected. 

There seems to be a bit of luck with the card distribution that can have a big influence in the game. There was a marked tendency to mind your own companies and buy your own assets, leading to solitaire play, because it seemed like the best strategy. Need to play more to see whether this is a flaw or just a case of group think.

My sentiments exactly.

[q="Chaddyboy"]I generally love economic games, so I was really interested in the idea of Greed Inc. The game is about making a huge profit one turn with a company, and then tanking it the next, likely getting yourself fired from the company for a huge severance bonus. Sounds fun!

However, I think this game was really meant to be played as an intense negotiation game. You're supposed to have to barter with the other companies in play to get what you need, sometimes necessitating some fairly convoluted deals to make things happen. I really hate games that require this much negotiation, as I feel it just bogs a game down as you wait around for negotiations to finish.

On the flip side, you could play the game in a manner where everyone works on their own companies and doesn't need to trade as much, but this just results in a very boring game of going through the motions.

In the end, I just end up hating the game the way it's meant to be played, and the game is just plain boring if you try to play it any other way, so the game doesn't end up being for me. If you love games that have a ton of negotiation, knock yourself out with this one; you'll probably love it![/q]

Great system and better theme (conversion), but the complexity of strategic decisions to be made blocks the most important game aspect (shrwed dealmaking). In my IQ range, concentrating on an self-sufficient machine is much more efficient (since achievable) than including the many additional options that trading with other players offers into the computation.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
First Play: The rules are quite short and seem quite simplistic, however the reviews spoke of a game or enormous depth and a brain burner. I was resigned to write off the first game as an experience.

The game stages all correlate to assist or upset the overall balance of your strategy, go for points early and lose cash that could increase your portfolio. Buddy up with people and do deals whenever possible, this is a very sociable and fun game.

However the componants are nice but thin on the ground for a 60 euro price tag. As much as I like the game I could never justify paying such a sum for so few bits. And that is a shame.

After-shocks: The cold light of day and an autopsy makes me feel that there is little control in this game. The deals are very much out of the individuals hands, hence the ability to combine complimentary companies isn't a decision that you take. Winners seem unable to rationalise how they won, losers are equally bemused as to what they could have done to do better. This now seems more a back seat journey rather than a driver's seat race. Down graded to a '5' and removed from my wants list.

RATING: 9.9
Initial impressions:

I usually try to hold off rating a 10 after a first game, but this game is an exception.

I had some misgivings about the game when reading the rules, and couldn't quite see how some of it would fully work.  The moment the game began, however, everything took shape quickly, and we swiftly began to learn to manipulate the system.

The game really opens up once a player has two CEOs - the manipulations explode, self-sufficiency becomes a large threat to the other players, if they haven't enough interest in the companies.

GI incorporates the best of the best mechanisms of other splotters (proper goods production and refinement, negotiations that were common in Indonesia's mergers, etc), along with some completely new and novel concepts.  The game flows extremely well, although we were still a little lost on the bidding - probably will stay that way until the cards are roughly memorized.

I cannot wait to play this one again!  Excellent!

1-16-10:

First 5-player game.  Two players were basically not playing well, and this may have disrupted things, but it felt...too slow.  Especially with the lesser number of turns, it felt like things didn't heat up until right at the end.  This may change with more experience.  Still a 10 for now (mainly due to expectations of better games in the future), but this play was by far less enthusiastic than the last.  Looking forward to the next play.

1-23-10:

After 2 3-players, and one each of 4 and 5, I think 3 may well be the best.  With 4 and 5, the game lasts for 8 turns, but it takes 3 turns to get the game going, and the last turn is almost non-existent, so it's really more like 4-4.5 "real" turns.  With three players, the story arc is better, and you get 9 or so "real" turns.  Lots of time for manipulations - with 4 and 5, it kept feeling like the game was just getting started when it was over.  It may be our play style, though.  I won't shy away from 4-5 player, but...it will be kept in mind.

I read a comment that finally summed it up for me.  I like (don't love, but like) the beginning and middle of the game.  Figuring out what card to play, when to make money, when to get out, all of those things work for me.  

But the end game flops.  It feels too chaotic.  Maybe I'm still missing something, but it just doesn't work for me.  Also, the chance for two players to collude to take their own cards is just too powerful.  If you can be one of those two players multiple times, I don't see how you can be beat.

RATING: 7.5
Es un juego económico en el que los jugadores empiezan manejando una empresa (aunque durante el juego pueden quedarse sin ninguna o tener hasta tres). Hay una fase de subasta de recursos para que la empresa produzca.. al adjudicar las cartas, se va creando una "plantilla" de dirección. Cuando una empresa en un turno produce menos dinero que el anterior, se producen despidos en la empresa y los directivos despedidos cobran indemnizaciones. Esas indemnizaciones son el dinero del jugador, con el que, mediante subasta, deberá comprar puntos de victoria. 
El dinero de las empresas no se puede usar para ese fin.

Es un juego muy divertido y tiene bastante estrategia. Altamente recomendable.

A really mathy negotiation game. Very topical for 2009. Can't say that our first play was fun. All that heavy-handed money laundering wasn't our group's cup of tea.

Like Container, the game requires that players play a certain way, otherwise the game isn't any good. This means for some, a game that's suboptimal.

We played with incorrect endgame conditions, so it dragged onnnnnnn forever, to the point where I convinced everyone to just quit and call a winner. 

Apart from that length and rule issue, I thought the game itself was excellent.  The possibilities for collusion between companies is endless and is a refreshing addition to the company game genre.

Update:  Jan 2010:  The game continues to be fun, but is simply too long.  I found myself getting bored again by abut the 2/3rd point, wishing we could just call a winner.   I have little desire to play this game again because of that alone.   Rating downgraded from an 8 to a 5 because of that alone.  The length really does damage this game.

Gets an eight right off the bat with lots of room to move up. A whole mix of mechanisms that work so well together it is stunning. The arc of the game is delightful.

First play was with three, but I can see it getting even better with four. Five might be a little too chaotic. But I'm looking forward to trying it.

Borderline amazing negotiation game where clever asset selection and boom/bust timing is about as important as savvy deal-making.

Easily the funniest non-party game I've played. Splotter have produced my candidate for best-themed game of the decade. For such a richly-themed and complex game, it's remarkably simple. We were up and running in 20 minutes and barely had to look at our cheat sheets by halfway through the game's 8 rounds. There is a lot to pay attention to in this game, but fortunately its spectacular production makes keeping track of everything a cinch.

Don't worry about the blind bidding, it's not a big deal. The auctions are mostly about keeping companies honest (ha ha): if they need an asset, they should pay for it or risk losing it to a competitor. The blind bid does not encourage insane micro-optimizations and second-guessing, saves time over a round-robin auction, and promises a 'fair' result in that you never have to pay your bid if you don't like what's left over, and if you don't like what's left over, either you underbid or someone else overpaid. I recommend playing with poker chips and having everyone write down bids on a piece of paper.

Playtime for our first game (4p) was 3 hours flat. I don't expect this number to budge much in either direction, though I'd estimate another 20-30 minutes if you add a fifth player. My guess is the game's sweet spot is 4--this allowed for complex, 3-player deals where which three players were participating was a major point of negotiation. Add one more player and I can see things getting chaotic. With only three, everyone will have a lot more control but I can't imagine that's a positive with a game like this.

Up there with Indonesia. Highly recommended for negotiation fans and/or business game fans!

RATING: 8.5
A strong 7.  The game is very fun and interesting.  It feels like a more volatile 18xx game with a lot of market noise that renders detailed planning obsolete.  That isn't to say that planning isn't important though.  This is a game full of scheming.  

I have a few smallish concerns, most of the related to the lack of investment control in the mid-late game.  It would have been nice to leverage personal capital in order to gain positions in companies.  The result seems to be that the game ossifies towards the end.  Not a bad thing in-and-of-itself but I think it sells the design short.  

Anyway, I'd be happy to re-visit the game in the future.

Update after a few more plays:
My previous plays didn't see the explosion of corporations which helps mitigate player control in the late game.  With additional corporations floated, the final stages of the game provide for some terribly mean moves whereby players use weak corporations to poach talent and gum up each others plans.

RATING: 7
Greed is easily the most stripped-down Splotter game of the past several years. The rules are simple: players control companies that have asset cards that allow them to make raw materials or to transmute them into more advanced things. There is a central market that is affected by cards that players select out of their hand at the start of each round, and which the companies can acquire. The heart of the game is a negotiation phase, where companies can swap cash, raw materials, and the like and then sell finished goods to the board. If the amount of money made goes up for the round, everything is well. If it goes down, the company needs to blame someone, and the 3 people who have chits in positions of power in the company can lay out blame, often to themselves. Why themselves? Because players get cash payouts taken from the present cash holdings when they are fired, and this money is used to buy conspicuous consumption items for themselves which are the only VPs. The VP cards are particularly clever, as they're auctioned off, and come in two flavours: gold and silver. The trick is that only one of each is auctioned off each round and the sale price is kept track of on the board. Say a gold item goes for $480...next round the bidding for the gold item must START at $480, and so forth. This is a brilliant little twist that is perfect for the theme.

As I said, this game is actually quite simple, the rules are short, and the way the game locks together can be explained quickly. All of the complexities come about in the negotiation phase, and because of the mechanic that forces cash earned into a special box that can't be accessed for another round (for the purposes of payouts to those being fired) or two (for the purposes of spending in the negotiation or asset acquisition phase). This is a game that absolutely will require A) the right group and B) a fairly regular group to reach its full potential. Though the game is simple rules-wise, it offers a considerable amount of leeway to cut creative deals and the fact that up to 3 players can have active blame-making power in a company and up to 6 chits can be present in the ranks means that there are a lot of temporary alliances and intrigue present in this game.

On the downside, as with most negotiation games, this one is extremely group-dependent, and it also seems to be much better with 5 than 4 because the game relies heavily on having interesting alliance structures created by the players in the acquisition phase. It's also a bit funky in that companies can be built so that they're not reliant on trading to make end products, and without trading there's basically no game present here. Again, group dependent and also choice-situational. When the game is working it's excellent, when it's not, it's very vanilla. My rating right now reflects the average experience. I honestly think that in play it can go between 5 and 8 though, basically depending on what group dynamics emerge. Probably closer to 8 with 5 at the table though, 4 is going to be much swingier, and I couldn't imagine playing it with 3.

Money! Calculating other people's incomes to a razor fine tip and knowing when to bail from your own company, while having a good chance to keep it to be a puppet to your newly started one, is one reason this game keeps me entertained. The random deck of assets is the only thing that makes the game feel less repetitive, despite my distaste of random elements.

quite interesting on a first play.  4 newbies in a 5 player game, but it flowed quite nicely, and we'd finished in under 3 hours, including a rules explanation.

felt vaguely like a cross between Die Macher and Traders of Genoa, and I liked it, but felt there was slightly too much chaos for the game length.

Have to admire a buisness strategy game where the goal isn't to run a company well....

....Its to run a company well enough to get first picks at all the Executive "Benefits" (like a stable of Secretaries, or a Golden Parachute) that an up and coming Executive needs.....!

Deeply cynical, but fascinating. Not sure I like it more than other games of its ilk (Megacorps, by Costikyan comes to mind), but if I saw a copy for sale at my FLGS, I would consider picking up a copy.

Despite some reservations about the relative power of controlling 2 companies, versus dealing with other players' companies to mutual benefit, I'm still rating this game somewhat high.  (I'd rate it higher without those concerns.)

Good theme and fun if you like this kind of corporate cutthroat. Simple rules. A bit long to play(3hours), start slowly and reach it's peak in the second half of the game.

Some novel concepts here of timing when and how to first run a company profitably, and then let it fall.  There's a lot of moving parts which made for what seemed an endless amount of analyzing (or, in my case, of just making ANY decision) which assets to choose and then which to trade/sell.  Hopefully, this is just the case in the first play.  I'm somewhat skeptical of the Victory Point purchases in that players could easily be locked out of gaining some crucial points since only 2 status symbols are up for auction each turn.  Certainly a difficult game to guage from a single play.  Interesting enough to warrant further plays, though.  Seems to be a bit too much negotiation for my tastes, though.

Rating based on one play.  The pacing seemed wrong at first but seemed to clear itself up toward the end.  We got through the first 5 rounds in about an hour and then it slowed down a bit.

I liked it - but it felt to me like there would be optimum calculations and that it was essentially "solvable".  I don't know if this is actually the case.  If I still like the game after 3 plays then maybe there is more too it than it felt like.  

In general I am a big Splotter fan.  I would like to play this again a couple times but I am not sure it would hold up to repeated plays like their other ones have for me.

There is a lot happening here, and the game seems to be a tug-of-war with itself in terms of what it wants to be.   There is open negotiation, economic engine building with produce/consume abilities, rise and fall dynamics, and auctions.   In theory, that sounds awesome, but in practice not so much.   There is a lot of tedious book-keeping here, not only loads of calculations, but also fiddling cards and sliders from place to place.   The biggest turn-off for me is the scoring.   Each round, players have a chance to bid for either a gold-level or silver-level prize that is worth VPs.   The problem here is that only one player can win each, and you can spend a huge portion of your time playing this game generating cash that ultimately may get you nothing.  Whoever has the most money will have the most power, for sure, and that's fine, but it leaves everybody else at the table with an empty and helpless feeling.   On the plus side, the opportunity for group dynamics is interesting, as players get executive slots in other player's companies.  While I enjoyed playing and learning this game, I don't think the fun-to-work ratio is good enough for me to want to play this more than a couple times.   It's more of a spreadsheet excersize and I think the appeal will be limited because of that.   If I'm going to play a long, heavy, and procedural game, then I'd probably opt for Die Macher.   Just because a game is heavy doesn't make it good... or even fun, for that matter.   Here is the textbook example.

The 2009 Splotter game made an overall good impression. It's clearly and heavy game but with very simple rules, it also has some juggling "a la 18xx" which I adore. 

Nevertheless, in my first 3 player play, I can't give up the idea that I've won it mainly because of a great 3 card drafting that allowed me to make a great combo on my own company (the other players could have tried to prevent it but...) occupying the CEO, CFO and COO positions and then fired them one at the time, and started the cycle again. I've yet to play it with 4 players and again with 3 to check on the card-luck-factor again.

This game drips theme all over it! The game design and the components are also great,I just have an issue since they didn't laminate the company boards, otherwise it is perfect.

Welcome to the business reality, this is a really nasty one! Nice black humour involved. 

I'm not sure should something be changed in the game to make it better but I had very funny time anyway and I would like to play this again. If there was more point cards with different points available to buy in each round, maybe there would be more sense in the game. 

But as cruel it is now, it suits perfectly with the game idea. However, this game should definitely be included in any business education - no degree completed before average score is over 25.

Despite its long playlength, it's as clean and elegant as Le Havre, has the Imperial-style meta-control mechanics I like, has the free-form trading of Settlers of Catan, and is sharply, amazingly satirical.

The caustic rebuke to corporate malfeasance goes beyond flavour-theming the companies, status symbols, and the "blah blah" good - the mechanics themselves are satirical.

You'll end up revenue smoothing, forming collusive company groups, extorting and breaking up your supply chain, running companies into the ground for the severance payments, and buying useless status symbols.

I'm a bit concerned about the harshness of buying trinkets, and whether the game has sufficient replayability.

Good game.  Not quite what I'd thought as the game is really about making the money, cashing in on it and getting out at exactly the right moment.  Managing the exit strategy seems to be the key to the game.

Liked the production with some cards requiring other resources. Really liked the trading and flexiblity, even though that part can drag out and get a bit long if you are not part of any trades. The pricing of goods where ok, but not great. Too many auctions for my tast in the game. And perhaps a step to far to have to get VP cards through bidding instead of just whoever has the most cash in the end wins. It makes for a quick fired strategy to be viable but adds another bidding that is not that fun.

Deceptive: the main thrust of the game mechanically (building up synergistic corporations and making a bunch of money) has almost nothing to do with how you win: be in the right spots of Corporate boards, time your payouts correctly, and win a large quantity of auctions.

RATING: 8.5
Extremely impressed after two plays (5pl and 4pl).  Blown away, even.

Players are cynical business executives who must figure out how to make as much profit as possible as quickly as possible for their corrupt companies.  When a company's bubble bursts, its executives loot as much as they can from the company's treasury on their way out the door.  In fact, the only way the [i]individual players[/i] can make money is by getting fired when the investors start to question their company's falling profits.  Players use their personal money to bid ridiculous sums on outlandish trophies like yachts, museums, and expensive-looking women.  After eight turns, the player with the best status symbols wins.

Greed is a very deep, very heavy economic and negotiation game with opaque, multifaceted strategies.  All of these strategies end in looting cash-rich companies, but there are many ways to make that happen.  The negotiation element succeeds brilliantly because (1) everyone is in bed with other players in the various companies, so players have mutual interests, (2) creative, coercive, and even corrupt deals are allowed and encouraged, and (3) the game's economy and cash flow is sufficiently complex to cloud the value of any deal.

Although I've described the game as "very heavy," this is a shockingly elegant game system with a very low rules overhead.  The rules complexity is probably on par with games like Thebes or Vikings, and much lower than moderately complex games like Puerto Rico and Agricola.  But be warned that there is a [i]lot[/i] of number crunching and money counting and change making.  Those who don't like demanding, hardcore economic games like 18xx or Indonesia are almost guaranteed to dislike this game.  Those who don't like negotiation and sharp dealing should also stay away.  What's left is a rather small target audience - but those remaining few are likely to love this game.

An economic game where players act as CEOs of companies who try to increase profits solely to take a huge golden parachute payment when it fails.

With three it seemed to be to easy to control your own company and get to much interaction (or lack there of) within your own company strength.  I'd hope with more players there would be less control over your own companies and more having to 'control' who's with you.

Because of the ease to get sole control of a company (or companies) there seemed to be VERY little negotiation and trading during the trade and process phase.  One once did someone have to 'pay for processing' and there was only a couple 'trades' for needed resources. 

Maybe it should be quadruple or something to buy your own assets.  Outside of that I hope for a better more chaotic experience with 4 or 5 players.  Otherwise it's too dry and formalistic.

I actually enjoyed that the points were represented my 'excesses' in life.  It really worked with the theme (if we would have been doing more wheeling and dealing).

Although the game ended fairly close.  If I would have made only 100,000 less in the last round, I would have lost to John.  And I'm not even sure we got the math right in the end.

I do wish there was more to the last round.  The last round seemed anti-climatic.

After more reflection, maybe it is more of a solo game then I was hoping for.  Maybe it is about building your own little world and cranking out money.  And then trying to give an asset out to someone just to get a little bit from them.  But, I really was expecting it to be more interactive with a lot more wheeling and dealing.  If after a couple more plays it continues to be about building your own 'chain', it may drop to a rating of 6.

There's a good game in here, but I the first two or three plays should probably be called early, if just due to how horribly unforgiving this game is: It is quite possible for someone to put themselves in an untenable position, and have pretty much nothing to do for a couple of turns.

There's also the issue of the luck of the draw. Some improvements are useless until others show up, so a player might end up forced to offer cards that just aren't appealing for anyone. A player that has three of their items out there, not purchased by anyone, might as well give up altogether.

RATING: 7
VERY initial rating on one play 4 players

Well we played a full game but I am not sure we really "played" correctly, the rules are very simple/elegant and that is not what I am getting at. Like Container (which I also think our group botched) I think the system itself which is very wide open is somewhat sensitive to how the group dynamics react to it.  

I'm not totally convinced however that the system just takes too long to ramp up with only 8 rounds and you cant really sink a company until round 3 due to starting money and how income works. So the game starts very slow with most companies not owning very much and as a result there isnt much to negotiate, the first rounds do go by quick however. We wanted to negotiate and looked around and tried to but the opportunities just weren't there and slowly became more and more available. I had some other small concerns too or rather maybe surprises like how the stock market worked.  

One of the key elements is a central market for 'wares' like coal, steel, textiles, etc. There is a pre-stacked deck that players get cards from and then they get to choose from one or two cards ONLY to auction off. These cards in turn manipulate the markets so players only have very little control over this and I was hoping for more, I'm not sure it will matter really so just an observation for now. Also though, the way the deck is stacked some things are somewhat predetermined like the market will start off strong and then almost everything will go down as the games goes on. Again this might have been necessary to the arc of the game so just an observation, I was just hoping that 'manipulation' would have also been part of the players choices in strategy but really it is very limited. 

Another concern was that people buying into their own company should have maybe been more expensive since the benefit was pretty huge and got progressively better. Just an initial observation again and because the system is so open the other players have a chance to not let this happen but it still seemed too cheap.  

Overall its a really wide open system which excited me when I heard the rules but in play some companies in our game became self sufficient and this meant more limited negotiation since they really did not need things from other players. Timing more than anything was key in the game, when to sink the company and hand it off for the payout. It might actually be too important since the VP's are auctioned off and this is somewhat of an 'opportunity grabbag' if your paying attention, good, bad, I lean towards the later but not sure yet. It seems like there should be lots of strategy but I think the system is limited in this regard, just my initial impression. Buy low, sell high, pile cash in and pull it back out, the negotiations though allow for some creativity and lucrative deals. Most likely a 3 hour game which should not surprise anyone looking here and great theme integration which again no surprise for Splotter. 

Definitely needs a replay to re-assess.

RATING: 8.9
Greed Incorporated is a spectacular gaming experience and is unlike any game that I have played. The gameplay is highly interactive and cleverly conveys the theme of corporate executives who are incentivized to boost short-term corporate profits and then cash out of the company just as the company declines.  Shell companies, corporate cronyism and fraud are all present.  It is remarkable to see how easily players can lose their ethical footing and become market manipulators bent on doing whatever it takes to boost their personal net worth.  This is a great social exercise in revealing that acting in one's self-interest does not always lead to the common good.  

This is a very well designed game that will definitely be seeing more plays with the right group.

Very reminiscent of Indonesia. The game has gorgeous bits but, ultimately, I was a little disappointed with the game. Love the theme though.

The game manual is well written, however it doesn’t explain many game situations and it offers little graphs (there is no business board graph) , so (in balance) it sucks. After I played the game, I read the FAQ and saw many situations we didn’t understood form the manual (a player can have more than 2 business if he inherits them, you cannot break your company before the 3rd turn, when you break a company, you always discard an asset, not when a new CEO appears and more).

I though the way you could gain a position in other players business was more direct, as it is, only by luck (as you need to choose from two cards) you can gain a position as CFO or COO, if your cards don’t match the goals of the company you won’t get an interest in that company, this process is indirect and for some reason (maybe the luck of the draw) bothers me. Also if a player manages to get two or more companies under his management, he has a lot of advantage, this bothers me because, as I said before, it is (more or less) random if you have the correct assets or not. The assets card also influence the market, but as they are random you cannot plan for this. To summarize, I feel there is a lot of chaos and uncontrolled luck in the asset deck, this bothers me because I was hoping for much more control, moreover in a game this heavy.

I love negotiation games, but many players in our game were self-sustained, so the negotiation aspect was very low, not sure if this is a game quirk or a game group quirk. The game begins very slow (as Indonesia), as at first no one has enough products/money to negotiate. 

I really like that Greed Inc. is a deep, meaty game., The winning strategy is not apparent, and the rules are very easy to explain (once you read pass the awful game manual). You can spend an awful lot of time generating money that can lead you nowhere as only 2 status symbols per game turn can be purchased (a plus for me :devil:).

Bottom line, the jury is still out on this one. I need to explore it further to see if my concerns are valid, also the game has a lot of unseen depth so I would like to play it again soon. Greed Inc. is a heavy game, nor for everyone. Try it before you buy it.

Current Rating: 5.0

RATING: 5
It's probably not Greed Inc.'s fault that it can't live up to Indonesia - not many games can.

The mechanisms for extracting personal cash from companies are clever - work directors up the ranks until the CEO finally decides to loot the company.  The conversions are pretty standard - however the negotiation phase feels a little low on options.  Maybe it's because I was too new at the game to position myself well, but I often found myself uninterested in trading due to resource constraints.

The auctions for status symbols (VPs) each turn are an interesting incentive to loot corporations early, but can make for an unsatisfying ending in which the amount of cash one's managed to loot isn't nearly as important as the timing with which one loots.  I'm not sure I find the auctions a satisfying scoring mechanism.  It's a little too easy to play for multiple hours only to have exactly one scoring action the entire game.

The theme is very clever, but that's double-edged since it's also extremely cynical.  I had a vaguely sick feeling much of the game, realizing that the theme actually wasn't that exaggerated.

Need to play once more - one play does not a good judgment make.  I don't see this becoming one of my favorites though thanks to the overwhelmingly important end-of-turn auctions.

Update:  I played again.  We were more aggressive about points early in the game and appropriately so.  It still becomes obvious about 60 minutes from the end that the players with the lowest incoming payoffs (and it is obvious who they are) have no meaningful decisions to make but must sit there keeping the game moving.  I'm done with Greed.  That's sad as I really wanted to like this game, but I no longer have excess gaming time I can afford to spend doing nothing of consequence.

In Greed Incorporated, players operate companies using both legal and fraudulent business practices in order to build a mountain of profits and then have their executives bail out with large severance packages just when stock analysts catch on that these booked profits can't possibly be maintained. Players then use this private cash to bid on status symbols, such as the "Non-Typing Secretary Pool" and "Adequate Transportation". The player with the most points in status symbols after 8 or 12 turns, depending on the number of players, wins.

The game is unique and, like most Splotter games, has a pervading sense of humor. From the company names (Zenron, iSpend, Soshitty Generale, Loanman Brothers...), to the status symbols (for "Office Decoration" there is a picture of a beautiful woman lying seductively on a sofa), to the supremely cynical rulebook, to even the resources, which range from the usual coal and steel to things like "loans" and "blah blah", the humor is everywhere and it works. It's very unusual for a game of this strategic depth to be so current and topical.

Is the game good? Definitely. Is it great? I don't think Greed quite reaches the level of Splotter's best titles. I've played with 5 players and 3 at this point and I suspect the happiest place to be is 4. The 12 turns in the 3 player game felt too long. But in the 5 player game, dishing out only 2 status symbols a turn felt like too few. Luck plays a slightly larger role in the game than I'd like. I actually enjoy luck in games if it leads to tactical and strategic variation. But in Greed, if you don't draw good assets to play, it's going to be very hard to place your executives in other companies and there's nothing you can really do to change the situation. The game is funny and fun to play, no doubt, but the cards can hamstring you a little too easily.

Splotter does Wolf of Wall Street the game. Sorta.

Greed Inc. is a darkly comedic take on excess and American business, where everyone is seeking to be the baddest CEO on Dun and Bradstreet. The game deftly weaves mechanism and narrative to the point where you rarely hear the wheels grinding in the background. 

Greed is one of the most thematic games I have ever played. Money is never enough and ultimately is spent to acquire bigger and better toys than your opponents. The fact that each toy is better than the last promises you will be leaving the game unsatiated. Greed never satisfies. 

My favorite part is the pump and dump of companies toward golden parachutes. It's also a blast to create feeder companies which float just enough to fund your larger parachute investment. I also like the idea of the auctions; however, my group has a tendency to stall out in the toy auctions, bidding early items so high that we rarely get to the good ones. Just once I'd like to own a premier team.

I don't particularly care for the market which is easily predictable or the trading and negotiating valuation which is quite obvious. Also the randomness by which you get into companies is less than ideal though not necessarily a deal breaker.

RATING: 6
Greed, Incorporated is the most thematic game I've ever played. No, seriously. 200 games rated. This is the most thematic. The passion and ambition with which this game was made should astound you. No punches were pulled, and the pitch black humor of Greed, Inc. may have laughing out loud or it may hit too close to home. Make no mistake, this is a game about the willful destruction of the world's financial system, featuring Enron, Worldcom, Arthur Andersson, and Bernie Madoff, to name but a few. It is about inflicting utter financial ruin for profligate self-gain. By the last turn, companies will be in shambles and the market will have imploded with no upward trend in sight.

Greed wowed me. It really did. As a game design, it packs a huge punch. Players position themselves as the CEOs, CFOs, and COOs of various companies. Usually, two or three different players make up the top brass at any given company. CEOs call the shots; the other two have a significant stake in the company's fortunes and are next in line to run it if the CEO is fired. Each company acquires assets of two types: hard assets like real estate, coal, and steel, and conversion assets, which allow the company to take basic resources and manufacture commodities like microchips. There is an intense negotiation phase in which CEOs can wheel and deal to amass the right raw resources for their company's manufacturing potential. Products are sold to generate revenue. If a company's revenue ever drops from one turn to the next, the "blame game" phase triggers, and 1-3 of the execs will get fired. But that's not a bad thing. No, in Greed, when you're "fired," you cut and run with millions, leaving an empty shell of a company. So you create market bubbles, leverage them aggressively, pull the plug, and fly off into the sunset while the world around you goes to hell.

Sadly - and it pains me to acknowledge it - Greed may have a fatal flaw. Though it looks like a "most money" game and talks like "most money" game, it isn't. Instead, even the scoring maintains consistency with the dark theme. To win, you must dump millions upon millions of dollars to attain status symbols: corporate jets, "office decorations" (the card for this shows a sultry, beautiful woman), and so on. These go to the highest bidder, and there's no way for the price to ever go down in subsequent turns (winning bids are the new minimum bids). No amount of money is ever enough. I admire it from a thematic standpoint, but our group was worried that it might break the game for us.

But it doesn't really matter. I will probably never forget the first time I played this game. I'm already anticipating the next session. If it has a fatal flaw, so be it. I'm still impressed.

Update: Sadly, a 2nd play has not done much to alleviate the scoring issues. I felt like the early game was much more playable since the table largely understood that lots of points could be had cheaply if there was a rush for them, but Michael was off playing a nearly-solo version with two companies run entirely in-house, so when he cashed out the minimum bids skyrocketed. I can't say for certain how much that rippled through the game, but the system certainly seems fragile. If Greed is often going to have a turn where the minimums go from 100 to 500 or something similar, this is quickly going to become a strictly avoided game. I have a game or two of this left in me, but I think the rating can only go down from here. What were they thinking with the scoring?

I would like to try this again, as our first experience was a discolored by a rules error, perhaps extending the game too long (or extending our expectations too long, making the game seem longer than it really is).  But it is a long game, and I can only see this getting more play if the game time comes down.

I enjoy the theme of the game, and even though I'm sure it won't age very well, the originality of the theme makes it more fun.  Most games are about building up an efficient engine and churning it for maximum profit.  Being able to loot the company and trash it is great fun and a new twist.  I seem to recall that you can do this in the 18xx games, but I've never played those.

I also really like the graphic design, which is clean, modern and effective.  It's hard to believe that Splotter released Duck Dealer, with its awful art, as most Splotter games' artwork is top notch (though definitely divisive).

I can see how the game is not for everyone, especially those that do not enjoy negotiation.  But for the *very* few rules this game asks you to learn, this offers a rich experience that I hope to explore further.

Update: Traded away.  I really like the idea and theme of the game, but I don't see the play time getting low enough to warrant it being played more than once or twice.  I'd like to see the ideas included here developed in a more streamlined game.  Raiding and trashing a company is so much fun.  But for some reason, this game just doesn't make the mark.

This game evolves while you play it.  From the outside it looks like you are doing the same thing over and over, but the decisions you have to make keep changing.  I would rate the game higher, but I will probably never win a game.
Further play has revealed a near perfect information AP problem that will have to be watched.  Great game, but the rounds need to move quicker.

This game made my skin crawl.  I'm still processing my single play of this game.  In fact, I won, but as we were all newbies, I don't ascribe much to this victory.

Greed is a smart game.  I think it is likely smarter than me.  Seeing the devious little hooks and maneuvers is surely some of the fun the designers put into the game.  But holy cow, is this game acid.  The commentary from this game is in no way uplifting.  Run companies into the ground, build your golden parachute, and waltz away with the most hedonistic trophys to win.

Probably worth some more plays, but I admit I'm not sure I am all that eager.  If I am going to play a 'mean' game, I tend to want to play 18xx.  Greed is a worthy game, but not one that fits into my normal agenda for games.

Wow! Very intelligent game with a high level of interaction. Very cynical approach to the financial crisis. Easy rules but very complex gameplay.
Players build up companies with other players invoveld in these. Everybody is linked together in a way that makes your brain hurt!
Money is only made by making companies going bankrupt and collecting bonii. If you´re involved the question is: get the bonus or do I keep the company? Timing is very important!
There may be a flaw to it if a player looses his company very early and is unable to  get a new one because of being too greedy and going for the status symbols. Result of this may be that this player is out for the next two or three rounds.
Question is if this is the players fault or a general flaw.
I think that this is a game for experienced players only where this kind of mistake will only happen once.
Great game!
And it`s playable with poker chips if you keep these in hands during the blind bidding phase. Saves time!

Economic, bidding, negotiation game. Loved the gameplay of trying to make a great company and then crashing the business because you're profits weren't as high as the previous year. However thought the win condition was a little wonky by bidding on victory point cards when you did not know what card was going to pop up next. Would of rather had most income collected by crashed businesses at the end. This was a very solid Splotter and had similarities to Indonesia, but would much rather play the latter.

Strange economical negotiation game. Rules are simple but game play and interaction is highly complex. Difficult to anticipate or prepare for the future. Lost its attraction. **** Try to get your board members in companies (even if you need to pay twice to get in your own company). Be careful when selling a good in the first round, you have to make sure that the new income in the second round is higher than the previous round (or risk a blame game with not enough personal gain to buy either a new company or a status symbol).

Greed has surprisingly simple, yet clever rules, great theme and it plays quickly (assuming nothing much happens in the trading phase). 

Unfortunately Greed seems to rely heavily on players playing the game in a certain way to make it work. And just like in Container, if the players don't play it that exact way, the game isn't any good.

RATING: 6
Excellent negotiation game involving the building up of different businesses and then seeking to crash them and make money off the fall...One can really do some sneaky things if you are the top dog in two companies, or have the only or more officials in the top 3 positions of each company.  Negotiation is free form and much can be traded between the different commodities and cash and future possibilities.  Initially, much of the market moves upward, but mid to late game the market tends to crash very hard.  

This is one of the least fiddly Splotter games they've put out recently!  It is also very straight forward/simple to explain and play (at least in theory) - doing well often involves having a first play to figure out how everything is interwoven and value as is typical in a negotiation game.  

One scores points not necessarily by cash but by purchasing gold and silver "trophies" when possible.  Of course, each trophy in subsequent rounds must be of higher cost since who can really boast about their "trophies" if they aren't above everyone else's?

Fantastic Splotter Spellen entry, great theme (the financial misdeeds of C-level executives), very nice components and gameplay which is engaging, exciting and challenging.

RATING: 8
I'm going to give this a tentative 8. That could easily rise or fall with additional plays depending on how things play out. As of right now all those involved in the first play though there was PLENTY more we could have done, certianly more corps would have changed control, more would have been created, and in the end the game would have evolved more. 

The best thing so far is that everyone wants to play again. There's some negotiation, which we all quite like, there's SOME control in terms of which corps you get into (though not much); I think it's a question of gambits in hopes to get into particular compnaies by playing cards that serve them best and once you get a chance to be the CEO then acting out your vision for the best cash until you can bail for the big payout.

One disappointment is that there's only an illusion that you're controlling the market. In the end the market swells and then recedes at a given rate and I do not see that changing much from game to game.

I think this is certainly a game for those who also enjoy Imperial, yet it's more the economics and less the board play.

Despite having no mechanics in common, this game's theme and "feel" reminds me of Power Struggle. Like most Splotter games, I'd shy away from playing this with math-adverse people.

Beware: deals should be actively sought after. It's easy to just seek equilibrium, but success in this game depends on being as greedy as possible.

 Interesting economic game.  This game seems to be about timing -- when to exit your company with your golden parachute -- and about reading what other people want (assets) in order to get yourself into other companies.  Rules are straightforward, but there seems to be a lot of subtleties here.

I've lowered my rating because I'm no good at this game and I don't know how to improve.  It feels like much is dependent upon getting your asset cards chosen by lucrative companies.  Getting crappy asset cards can hurt.  My rating could go back up a point, if I understand the game better with more plays.

I admire this game -- it seems fairly unique.  I don't dislike it, but I don't love it.  I'm happy to play this one when others want, but I probably won't suggest it.

Initial rating after 1 very entertaining play with 4: Another great Splotter game. Again different than their other games, but unmistakenly with the "Splotter touch". Less fiddly bits in this one.

The theme works perfectly. It's hard to have an overview over a company you're not a CEO of, and timing is as always very important.

Played 1 time with 3 people. Unfortunately we got rules wrong and played 10 rounds instead of 12 because we finished when last card was taken and not when last card was played.

I think it might be even better with 4 because it will be harder to be self-sustained and trading will be even more important.

EDIT: Played again, this time with 4. I am not sure if it was better... more or less the same. Somehow I think I liked it more when there were more rounds.

Another Splotter game with simple rules but very deep, involved gameplay.  Complete freedom to make any deal will be very group-dependent.  Lots to try and keep track of, so a group that is too serious will see the game take forever to play.  Interesting choices as to when to trash your company.  Even if you look out of it, possible to come back.  Worth the acquisition.

May '16-  Now I know how to manipulate the companies, it has lost some lustre.  Essentially, the whole game will be about handling screwing other players in company selloffs similar to the train manipulation in 18xx games.  This does not appeal to me as much.  The market worked well but not enough in there for me at this point.  However, willing to play again.

A fantastic theme that doesn't always work as well in practice (in the game), but overall, with five players, this is still a very good game. Timing of the blame game is of the essence, but when this should be done is rather murky, as you want to be one of the only ones doing so, so you can buy points cheap. To play this well, you really need to assess the overall situation, which could take way too long with people suffering from AP. If you don't play with people who want to literally figure it all out, the game becomes a bit of a crap shoot due to the 'fog of war'.

Great game, like all the others Splotter Spellen of the same line of games, indonesia, roads and boats, antiquity.
A bit expensive for what it brings in the box, but excellent design. A very intriguing, busy and most disputed game. A few great mechanics. 
It worth the 4h30 hours we took in our first 3 newbies players game.
This game is a little tricky at the beginning, but as soon go it, a new world opens to you. A lot of crafty tricks and options to choose. A difficult game indeed. Sometimes, I had the same feeling of playing Die Macher. Not that the game have similarities in it's play, but in sense of a real deep and complex game. 
Indispensable for all guys who just love a great evening with a truly heavy weight game. 
Prepare your evening, and you will have a lot of fun.
Must play it again as soon as I can. Good work.
My rating could rise with more plays.

Second play- 4 players, the game is better and much more quicker with 4 players. Only took us 3 hours. The corporates are even more difficult to manage. Everybody wants to take part of all companies.

Great game here. A must for any collection.

RATING: 6.5
The game is definitely interesting, and I'm pretty sure it's a good game on top of that. I'm less sure that it's a game I enjoy - it seems that the "right" way to play it is very careful analysis of negotiations, and that's a very very slow process. I'd cheerfully play it a few more times soon to be sure.

I think the game probably needs very analytical negotiators to stay close.

Alice has the ability to turn a set of primary goods that could sell to the bank for $100 into a $250 finished product. Bob and Charlie between them have the input goods. What's the right way to move goods and money around to get everyone a fair share of the profits while allowing people to book those profits over the next one or two turns that they're willing to live with? What even is a fair share of the profits when people are putting in different values of input goods and one person's contribution is the opportunity to make the conversion at all? Is "fair" even the right metric, or should some subset of the players boycott a deal that keeps the leader in a leading position?

Greed, Inc. delivered one of the most annoying gaming experiences I have ever suffered through. Do be advised, though, that I won the game handily, almost doubling the score of the player in second place.

The ideas presented are actually quite simple and straightforward... take over companies, make them a ton of money in one year, and drive them into the ground the next, taking blame and receiving a ridiculous 40% payout for being fired. You have the opportunity to make cash from other players' shenanigans, but the big bucks come when you're the CEO, and especially when you control 2 companies at the same time.

At one point in the game, I did ABSOLUTELY NOTHING for about 1/2 hour. I tanked my company, bought a victory point card, but didn't have enough to win the bid for a new company. So I sat there and waited for an entire round to finish so that I could then get back into the game and "have fun."

Greed, Inc. is basically a game that forces you to be a scumbag. In fact, the companies you'll choose from are parodies of famous douchebag companies like Enron and the like. The "strategy" is obvious - get your mitts on two companies, sell off all the assets of one to the other for a dollar, then reap the rewards for being an asshole. That's really all there is to it.

So, I see that there are just as many people that love this game as hate it. Personally, there's pretty much no way you could convince me to play this pile again. There really is very little game here. It's essentially a simple math problem, and the player that can time things to pay off big at the end will win. I'm not a big fan of Splotter in general, but they really lost me with this stinker.

Molto bello, vorrei riprovarlo (ci ho fatto solo una partita) perché non è affatto banale e mi sono proprio divertito. Ha le azioni iniziali un po' obbligate ma poi si scioglie e diventa interessante, al contrario l'interazione nella parte iniziale è totale mentre nel finale diventa quasi un solitario.

Col passare dei turni di gioco i soldi in circolazione cresceranno a dismisura, ma è più vantaggioso avere un bel gruzzolo costante che puntare ad un finale ricco; contano i punti vittoria non i soldi!

Lo sfondo è un mondo finanziario e imprenditoriale immorale.

Belle le scalate aziendali (ricordano 1830?). Un tantino maschilista con un po' di ironia. Lo consiglio.
Tra le negatività la lunghezza, la ripetitività di alcuni passaggi e i pessimi materiali, a cominciare dal tabellone.

Dopo la prima partita però il giudizio è decisamente positivo.

I think there are some serious flaws concerning the VP system. The game is too long for what it is, this is mainly due to fiddly-ness. There didn't need to be so many kinds of resources - that number could probably have been cut in half. Finally, the game is likely to lack re-play value, as the same deck of cards comes out every time.

Wow. A fun experience. Played with 3, would like to try 4.

A bit of a learning curve. It feels really counter-intuitive to make your company profitable in the beginning.  Get some $$$'s in its coffers, and then turn around and intentionally run it irresponsibly so that you get the boot and a bonus. The only way to get personal cash to buy status symbols, which are victory points. 

Pretty cool game all around.

The theme works well here as you make deals with others in order to build a company and then leave it, but without forgetting to get your hefty bonus. This is a mix of negotiation, timing and money management. As your company needs to make more each year by selling in the market, you need to know when to bail and start a new company, but others may want your old one, seeing potential in it.

Wow! Where do these guys get their ideas from? In the age of worker placement and resource management games, Splotter is able to consistently create games that feel fresh, thematic... and heavy, defying the zeitgeist while still managing to keep a very high standard in their releases. They definitely belong to the trend setter pack and I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of designers followed their releases very carefully.

Greed, Inc., their latest release, is clearly a theme driven game. It's also a very intelligent, dark and sarcastic take on the current world financial crisis. And it still manages to be a heavy economic and negotiation game unlike any other that I've played. One that spits in the face of all the hip mechanics of the day and uses stuff like the not very trendy auction and the blasphemous blind bidding, among other heresies. 

In my first game, I schemed, I plotted, I negotiated, I laughed, I cried and, in the end, I was dying to play again. That's the mark of a great game.

Yes, it's expensive, it's true that the components are not spectacular (but are perfectly functional), but it's completely worth every penny!

This Splotter release has an appealing theme: You are CEO of one or more companies and you let the company collapse. Then heads have to roll. Each member of the Board, the CEO, CFO and COO must each have their say who the alleged culprits.
And if you are amongst the fired, you let the company behind you while you get your mega fat bonus paid out. No hard feelings, since you have huge reputational damage.
From your private money can buy bling-bling because that is the goal. The player who has the best collection of bling-bling is the winner.

The game is nicely equipped and the rules are not too difficult. And it's just nasty fun to let cash flow away with the help of other crafty CEOs. You gotta love those obscure accounting tricks. Tip!

Considering Splotter's reputation, I was expecting something both heavy and original, but Greed Inc. is neither.

As with any Euro, it's a mix of various mechanisms:

1. Card drafting, but in this case, each player plays card, each of which will be available to be drafted. Each card represents either a resource ("asset") or a resource converter (i.e. two "land" for one "real estate").

2. Open negotation: Each player owns some goods and controls some resource onverters. But of course, one player might need someone else's resource converter, so you trade money and resources to produce stuff with resource conveters.

This is supposedly the heart of the game. However, I didn't find it that interesting compared to other negotiation games. I differentiate negotation games from trading games. In trading games, you trade resources. In negotiation games, you trade things other than resources, namely actions. So Bohnanza is a trading game, while Diplomacy is a negotiation game. I find negotiation games far more interesting since is very difficult to determine the valye of a trade. In Greed, Inc. the actions are limited (i.e. give me this resource or make this asset), and each resource has a specific dollar value (you get to sell your resources during one phase of each turn). So the negotiation experience feels more like a big calculation exercise without none of the nasty subtely you'd expect in a negotigation game.

3. However, one mechanic makes this game unique, and compilcates the trading phase: if a player makes less money than he had the previous turn, he loses control of the company, but takes 40% of the money in its treasury. So, if a player who is controlling a company has a lot of money in its treasury, that player has an incentive not to perform any efficient negotations.

I suppose it's because of this mechanic that Greed, Inc. is getting comparisons to 18xx games. This is not the case: In 18xx games, each and every "moving part" of the game is interconnected, which makes these games deeply strategic and subtle. Greed, Inc. is like a typical economic engine style of game: You get this resource to get this resource to get this resource, etc, to finally get a point -- the "moving parts" of Greed, Inc. are linked linearly. In particular, you draft resoruces and resorce converters, create more valuable resources, sell those resources, keep on doing this until your company has lots of money, loot your company, then use your money to buy points. Then repeat.

========

So if you're a fan of Euros, don't mind the 65 Euro sticker price for below-average components, and you are not expecting a game heavy on strategy, but high on tactics and arithmetical calculation, then I suppose it's worth trying Greed, Inc. But if you're expecting a deep and immersive strategic gaming expericence with a theme of immorally mainupulating economic forces, then stick to 18xx.

Suspect this will be another favourite of mine, and send me searching for the other (expensive) Splotter titles that I don't have.

EDIT:  After one play I can confirm what I suspected when reading the rule book - it's primarily a negotiation game, which is not my favourite mechanism.  Good game, but [i]Indonesia[/i] is better.

An economic game with many common features (auctioning for control of companies, resources, and "buildings"; processing and selling goods; negotiation; trading) and a more uncommon feature (gimmick?) of firing the directors of these companies so that they can receive severance packages used to purchase luxury goods for prestige (victory points).

Apparently I love long,complicated, and/or economic games. I bought this based on review strength. The few times I've been able to get this game to the table has been interesting. Watching first time players, used to trying to collect the most, adjust to the goals of the game is akin to watching a butterfly emerge from a cocoon.

Simultaneously one of the best economic games I've played, and one of the sharpest satires I've seen in the medium. It forces you to think like a crooked CEO, and it does so in a way that is totally organic. This is thematic game design at its finest.

Rating could go up or down. Highly intriguing premise, with the usual things that Splotter gets right, as well as the usual impressions of half-baked things that they get wrong.

Too many of the game mechanics seem irrelevant to the point production, and much of that is deliberately king-making based.

 Nice economic game. Didn't understand too much what I had to do as I hadn't read the rulebook myself but rather I had the game explained to me by others and that's not always a good thing to do with me- I'm slow.

 But the whole concept is nice, it is well made and it seems like a good design. I'd love to give it another try although I don't remember anything from it.

Somehow I found a way to be effectively eliminated from the game after three turns.  It turns out that we were playing it wrong and that you can't get the boot on at the end of the first turn.

Still, that screwed things up for us big time.

How 'bout putting that in the rules...hmm?

I fear that it might be very fragile, but I like the system.  I'm looking forward to trying it again.  

I have no interest in trying this with more than three players.

Wow, fun game! The rules are pretty straightforward but game play is very interesting. The cool part, other than the theme of course (greedy company people, who only make money when they're fired 'cause the company performance fell -- and the get a severance package as they go!), is the way you have to manipulate your companies: grow it, then tank it so you can run off with some cash. It's much more interesting, though, when you end up with 2 companies -- the first several turns just felt like buildup -- and you can use them to help each other out. It's like those 18xx games I don't understand, where you somehow crash a company before passing it off to another player. But this, fortunately, seemed to be a bit less opaque than 18xx stock manipulations.

The production is good, although:
- it uses paper money (just sub poker chips)
- cubes, I think, would've been easier than goods cards

Need to try this with 3 or 5!

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
It's a well designed game that does a good job of incorporating the theme.  I'm sure it will appeal to many gamers and my rating reflects some personal biases.  First, I'm generally not a fan of negotiation games.  Second, I found the theme too cynical. Perhaps it's more amusing in a short game, but in a game of this length it started to wear on me.  Third, I'm wary of long games unless they really captivate me.  Granted, ours was a learning game, but it seems like it would take much longer than the three hours listed, too long for a game that just doesn't hit the sweet spot for me. Also, and perhaps most importantly, the game feels like work, which seriously reduces the fun factor. Lastly, it's a bit too fiddly for my taste, trying to keep track of which money goes in which pile.  The rules are fairly clear for such a long game and, again, my rating reflects personal quirks, so if you enjoy games of this ilk you will probably like this one.  For a game this long, though, I prefer to invest my time elsewhere.

RATING: 7
I might play this game again but I'm glad I got to play a friend's copy with it being on my own wishlist for so long because now I no longer feel the need to obtain my own copy.

The game has a fun little theme, the goal is to become the CEO of companies, make them profitable...until the time is right to crash the company and take a portion of the profits as your severance to buy status symbols with.  The player with the most value in status symbols at the end wins the game.

This was my first play of a Splotter Spellen title and I was a little disappointed with the quality of the game's components.  They were fine, nothing awful, but for such expensive games I expected a lot more.  The way they could have improved it was with little things like the company mats.  Companies change hands throughout the game pretty frequently and on those company mats you place several cards and money but they're made of flimsy paper.  A thick cardboard mat would be much easier to pass around the table without making a mess, this is baffling when you know this is a major piece of the game play.

Past that, it's a good game.  It's just a deep, deep, deep economic game with a lot of different decisions to make, all of which affect the game in meaningful ways.  I'm not even sure what the best strategy is, there was a disagreement between a friend of mine and I whether the goal should be to make as much profit as possible in the early stages of the game and go for broke with the status symbols in the final 3-4 turns (my opinion) or constantly be making smaller private fund profits and buying status symbols throughout the whole game.

The game also seems like it would be extremely different between 3 and 5 players.  We played with 5 and there was a LOT of downtime which was a little brutal, the decisions are so complex and meaningful that the game is close to impossible to play AP-free.  But 5 players also increases the amount and value of available assets and introduces a greater swing in the product markets.  It also provides for much greater competition when bidding on assets, starting new companies, and (most importantly) status symbols.

I wouldn't mind mining more of the strategy out of this but I'm also okay if I never get a chance to play this again.  Very interesting if nothing else.

I was a bit disappointed on this one. When I first read the rules it seemed like a classic Splotter game with short simple rules and a terrific gameplay with for sure some new mechanics and also a new feeling. The theme presented itself to be in the day to day agenda and the interest in getting into it as a difficult/fun game was immense.
Sadly this game turned out to be pointless in the long run since players are always competing for only a couple of VP's cards and that's really annoying. Most of the time only one (rarely) two players were competing at the same time for the same VP card and that turned out to be very frustrating. In the end, the last auction, is clearly gained by the player who had the most money.

I can't figure out why this very enjoyable game in certain aspects wasn't made in a different format allowing players to dispute both gold and silver VP cards and also why is not possible to buy more that one card in the same round. Plus, it seemed very annoying the fact that a player can make trades between two companies he owns for a single buck allowing some promiscuous gameplay.

The trading mechanism is the core part of the game and it's up to players to make it work. I'm not sure if I like that. I really think that a good trading mechanism should be part of the game itself and not dependable on how players do. Container has this same exact problem to me.

I really want to get into the rules again to see if we missed something because there's something in this game that really doesn't appear to work at all.

To much expensive for what you get. I understand that buyers should only buy Splotter games if they want to but the real truth is that the playing boards are not good enough (they weren't either in Duck Dealer). The art work is very good but components are average.
I guess I won't be buying more Splotter games at this price after these last two disappointments (Duck Dealer and Greed Inc).

Perfect example of a Euro with a very strong theme: crooked plutocrats strip-mining companies and the economy for personal gain. The game follows a very strong narrative arc: players are big business executives who try and build the most profitable businesses they can -- but if current year profits don't exceed last year's, someone has to take the blame. Whether it's the CEO, CFO or COO, that player gets a pile of personal cash they can spend on perks like mistresses and private jets. These give victory points. This process also drives down the economy in general.

One of the key strategies is to become CEO of multiple related companies at once, making it possible to ruin one -- e.g. by selling key commodities at far below market prices, or even "selling" money for less than it's worth -- to give another company massive profits. When the following year you can't repeat the miracle, you bashfully take the blame, resign, and pocket 40% of that banner year's profits.

It's a tremendously fun twist on resource production/market games. My first Splotter game, it's one I liked very much indeed.

Ratings history: 8->7.5 -- I don't like the way the victory point auctions work and it runs a little long for a game with this level of control. Much worse with three players.

Good Meaty game that reminds me alot of 18XX.  The payouts are similar.  The company maniputlation and the market has an 18XX payout feel without the trains.  But not enough different to get me to buy it.  there is also a lack of control factor.  If other players do not buy the assets you put for sale .... then you do not get into enough companies to raise the cash to compete in the auctions for the luxurary goods.  this truly holds at a 6 for me

Grow your company, but only with a view to bailing out when the moment is right, and you don't really want to leave anything but a smouldering wreck for the player that inherits your plaything.

The way the assets appear can have a major influence on how much inter-company trading occurs, and therefore how much real interaction there is between players.

Very interesting game. You try to be CEO, CFO or COO in a firm. Then you want that the firm grows, but at some point you want, that the firm stops growing. You will be fired, but get money. For that money you can get a new firm or buy prestige (VP).

You can trade with other players, there are many goods, their prices changes at a market. The market goes up, but then down.

The game is long, but it is different to other economic games, so you don`t feel the time. Try to grow "your" firm or firms is not so easy. You must look at the trends at the market and remember the last years income of the firms (when your new income is not higher, then someone will be fired). You want to be fired, but you must choose the best time for that. You can`t wait too long, because you need private money to buy prestige.

I wan`t to play more.

The rules are pretty simple and straight-forward, but man, that's some dense, obtuse strategy.  The game obviously requires a lot of wheeling and dealing to optimize the potential production/processing chains but in our first game we were all a bit too bewildered on what exactly we should be doing to get our economic engines in motion.

I hope I can get some plays out of this one, because I think this game could really shine.

And the satiricial touches are great, though perhaps thematically nonsensical at times.

A good Spotter title, certainly more playable than Duck Dealer. Players are company officers running companies that either do primary production or produce more complex goods. The twist is that the only way for players to actually make money is to take a golden parachute out of company funds in the crisis when profit fails to increase year over year. Juggling companies and getting a couple seems to be key. Not actually a very long game, there's a very strict game-clock that kicks in just as the markets for goods are starting to crash. Needs some more plays to figure out if there are multiple good strategies to follow.

Corporate pillaging from the folks who brought us Antiquity, Indonesia, Roads & Boats.

So much potential.  Squandered by the lack of control.  If it were easier to target other companies to be made a board member of this game would improve significantly.  As it is you are stuck with a choice of 2 cards which may or may not be of interest to a company you want to make inroads with.

Furthermore the end game scoring system and the ability for only 1 new company to be created a turn is complete and absolute rubbish.  Both mechanics suck the big one.

This was a novel take on the 18xx system of company management for profit.  However, it lacks the appropriate mechanisms to properly invest in and create companies.  I'm going to keep the game and see if I can improve on things with a stock market for companies and move to an 18xx style personal cash = victory points.

The theme is bitingly satirical, but the mechanics are not that dissimilar from a lot of other market-driven games.  Mechanically there's some interesting tweaks here, such as the eventual bottoming out of the price of nearly every good, which impels players to move up and out of companies.  The gameplay is rather dry, though, with an awful lot of math determining what fair trades are.

This is a very fragile game, one that is good when it works, and terrible when it doesn't.  Games can fall victim to groupthink, and it is possible to eliminate yourself early on if you aren't careful.  If too many people fold companies too quickly, there's a situation where there simply aren't enough companies for interesting gameplay, and several people are shut out completely.

Splotter risks big on every title, and when they get a hit, it works out perfectly.  Even in misses like this, at least the game feels unique.  It's not like anything else out there, and it certainly will have you thinking, but ultimately this game is just too much work and too fragile with too little payoff.

WOW, what an interesting game. There was just too much information to process on my first outing. On some level I just gave up and played by the seat of my pants. But with repeat plays I expect this multi-layered game to unveil itself. I get the strong feeling that this is best with exactly four players- with 3 we lacked a little bit of interaction but with 5 I imagine there are too few scoring opportunities for each player (which I presume leads to the issues some have been complaining about). 

UPDATE: a few more plays have confirmed my initial impression that this is in fact a fascinating game with lots of subtleties and depth to explore. The trade-off between staying in a company and jumping ship is really accentuated by the limit of one scoring card per player each round. Like other Splotter games, there is a bit of fiddlyness to the process of moving money and other bits around, but it is well worth the interesting dilemmas and decision-spaces this game has to offer.

Finally got to play this very interesting game after 12+ months of trying to get it played. Played 3 player, took approx 4 hours.  It was a very interesting experience.

Players act as company owners whom are trying to pump up the cash capital in the company's coffers, and then try to purposefully wreck it when it has a good large capital to get booted out and get a big fat payout or golden parachute as I'll call it.

Of course you don't have to do this, you can try to position yourself to take over rival companies, or even wreck a company you yourself are in so you inherit the company or hire a COO or CFO (or whatever they were) for positioning purposes.

You can also control other companies (up to 3 I believe).

One thing I really did like was the basic, stripped down book-keeping or profit/loss ledger sheet.  New Revenue is on the left, last year's revenue in the middle and your working capital is on the right.  

I liked the theme, the concept and would play it again.

----

Played again with 3 people. Very interesting game. Took 3 hours. Very interesting game. Its fair to say its not a good idea to buy VP status cards early as they really don't do anything but rather get another company running.

I found it to be a bit lop-sided with 3 people; 1 person can easily run away with the VP if not careful.

I also found that the deal making falls a bit flat with 3 people the longer the game goes on; if you're playing with entrepreneurial business-minded people its very fun and exciting to see crazy deals going on.  I like to try to send a goods card around the table or bounce it back and forth without having to sell it.  Its all very interesting.

I don't like the amount on money changing going on towards the end; but I guess its sort of thematic.

Very interesting game and worth playing; but probably not worth buying though.

--

Update: 18-Jun-2017

Finally got to play with 5 players, wow; its a significantly better game with 5 players, you never really know who is ahead and the game seems to steamroll a lot faster.   The game did not feel as lop-sided as 3 players, the game has serious runaway leader problems with 3 players and I found the 5-player game engaging and kept my interest; I'm always on the look out on whom I can do a deal with.

Given all this, the game is significantly long, and is also very linear with few or little patterns or strategies. 

I did like the game, although I'm not sure I'm going to keep it, I would like to play it again with 5 players but I am in no rush to do so, I certainly do not think its worth buying but it is certainly worth playing, but only with the full 5 players.

RATING: 7
Rating after one play. Cutthroaty economic game. First play had some misunderstood ruleproblems, but even that game showed that I might like this game a lot, time and plays will tell.

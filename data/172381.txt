I'm really disappointed by My Village. So many things about it sounded and looked really cool, but they proved to be pretty dull from the very moment I set down to play it.

Let's start with the graphic design. While the artwork and MOST of the components are pretty good and in line with the euro-game standards, I really hate the universal black cylinders... and this comes from someone that loves wooden pieces. The problem here is that you can easily mess something up on your board and then who knows what was where at that point. I understand that this choice probably made the game less expensive, but it also impacts the ease of play.

However, besides this clearly superficial reason, what really disappointed me were the mechanisms of the game and the ways in which they combined. I was expecting a sand box game, where you had plenty of choices and paths to explore, and that is definitively not true. You have indeed 3 paths: Church, Voyages and Commerce... and you get to take 2 out of 3 every time. This translates into a very repetitive game-play, but maybe the problem were my misplaced expectations. What made this repetitiveness even worse is the dice drafting mechanism. 

While I liked it in Seasons, the dice drafting in My Village is just as boring as it gets, because your choice doesn't really translate into anything meaningful. You simply take the dice you need with or without some manipulation of the results. Every time I played this game, I felt like there could have been any other mechanism in here and it would have worked just as fine, if not better! If anything, the dice drafting only made things more tedious, because you now have to roll those damn cubes every turn, which adds up to the play time for no good reason at all!

At this point it might sound like I hated the game... and I did in some of its aspects. I think it could have been a much better game than the one that it is now. Yet somehow My Village wasn't really a terrible experience. It was repetitive for sure, sometimes even annoying and boring, but not bad enough to deserve a really low rating. Easily forgettable for sure, but there's still worse titles out there.

1st play: The initial setup and board layout is intimidating, but once you learn the game most of the symbols are straightforward.  The dice are well integrated into the mechanics and the strategic use of time actions that was present in Village is here.  Some of the cards are unique, which I'm not sure I'm a huge fan of, but it might be ok once I've played again.  Production is good and the decisions are meaty.

No second play but looking back I still would be interested to play again.  I'd have to relearn the game from scratch but I enjoyed my first play so that wouldn't be too bad.

A considerably fiddlier version of Village, the earlier game being far superior. The art of My Village is better, though; but the iconography is very confusing. Player interaction is much higher in My Village; but thematically the game is much, much weaker. I mean, the peril of rat invasions...because they're going to eat your books? From Wikipedia: "No demographic group in Medieval Europe feared the Black Death more than the librarians." 

Nevertheless, it remains a good game; but it is my least favourite of the Brands' offerings....which, for me, is like saying My Village is my least favourite dark chocolate! The Brands still seem incapable of producing a truly bad game.

Difficile definire My village se hai gia giocato il predecessore Village.Credo che la definizione piu calzante per questo gioco sia  "Village con i dadi e piu complesso".La tematica e l'ambientazione sono rimaste le stesse ed anche la meccanica del tempo che trascorre.La differenza è data dall'uso dei dadi che ha reso la fluidità del gioco un po' più macchinosa.Credo che village sia ancora migliore rispetto a questo gioco,che tuttavia può offrire un buon tasso di sfida dato dalle diverse strategie adottabili per conseguire la vittoria.Consigliato a chi è fan della saga, per gli altri...no!

I've really enjoyed My Village - lots to think about and strategies to try. Nice weight and easy to play and enjoy. It is however very difficult to get to the table - it requires a huge amount of space and some time to setup so can be overlooked for other games in the collection. Must make more of an effort to play.

This is a game that, had I played when new to board gaming, I may have loved, but after several years and hundred's of games, I simply found annoying.

The main problem with any more than 2 players, is the amount of time(turns) it takes to accomplish things. Small actions like grabbing 1st player and banking those points take 3 turns to accomplish, and that's assuming the numbers you need are available. I can see how it would be very good with 2p since you're getting multiple actions per turn, but with 3p, it was way too drawn out.

RATING: 6.5
First Play (4P): Own and like Village so had high hopes. Explaining and understanding the rules is  clunky. There is no natural flow with so many component parts that aren't obviously clear in what they do and some that seem crudely bolted on to the rest of the options. The game engine works to a fashion but progress is faltering and each move feels like you aren't achieving anywhere near enough. The need to move your head man out from the house and back to bank the points in the tree just seems like you have spent two moves doing nothing. Why not let a player bank the points with one move, it would be the same for everyone?

My biggest criticism is that there seems only one very obvious means to churn points, the brown and blue cards. Gather multiple cards with the same die numbers to your array, generate multiple goods, collect multiple markets in one turn and cash in. Rinse and repeat. Add to that a red card that gives multiple points for villagers or market cards and you are sorted. The traveller/ road is just too time consuming, random and resource heavy to score in the high 20's. Collecting Monk for 20 points is just as expensive. Talking to experienced players afterwards and they agreed that the goods-market route is the best way to score. It seems strange that there are enough cards to let players do this at will until game end.

I'm surprised this wasn't refined further by the publisher before release.

My Village probably suffered from me having played a bunch of "decent" Euro games that are starting to feel pretty samey. This one seemed balanced and mildly interesting but mostly boring. I found Village a very good game and My Village carries through some of the theme and ideas, but we were all not excited about it as we played.

RATING: 4
Dice game adaption of the good, but not great Euro Game Village. This game is not very good. As with many of the more complex dice game adaptions it tries to model the mechanics of its predecessor with dice.
Therfore it is overly complex for a dice game. Also the mechanics make sense if you try to model Village with dice, but are overly constructed if you look at this game on its own. 
Additionally the tableaus get to big, the whole game is just to complex for what it is. A lot of complexity, at the same or even lower level of depth than village (which is already too easy).

Initial Impressions:
----------------------
A very crunchy dice game for sure.  It does have the feel of village for sure, and the overall game engine is very impressive.  There are MANY ways to score points, and I assume many different ways to win, but the lack of any part of the setup being variable is a little disappointing.  The game is fun, and for how long it takes (60 - 90min) is very crunchy, but I am not sure what there is in the game that will keep it changing from game to game.  Most definitely worth a look, and if you enjoy Village, this is very similar, but a bit more crunchy, and most definitely worth a look.

A tároló rekesz egy vicc. A kinyomó kartonból kivett táblák nem férnek el benne, csak rajta. Csak egy picit kellett volna tágabbra szabni a belsejét, hogy bele lehessen tenni a táblákat. Ráadásul sima karton papír, melyen semmilyen hangulati elem nincs. Megy a kukába.
A kártyák soha nem látott minőségűek. Majdhogynem közelíti a vékony tokenek vastagságát.

Not as random as it seems: most dice results are good for something and they are easily modified. Still, it lacks player interaction: everyone fights on his own, only comparing final score. Interaction is minimal (taking dice or some tiles before others). Tiles are a litttle too big: game needs a lot of space for setup.

An inoffensive, quiet, somewhat soothing and autoplaying conversion of the original game. The hard work in the game has been done by the authors in working out which numbers to put on the various cards; you as player only have to select the different paths and see how that works out for you. Nothing wrong, nothing remarkable either.

Too much solitaire for me. Not much of a ramp-up either, you more or less do the same thing for two hours which makes the game drag at the end.

A interesting dice drafting game based around building your personal Village. It drags a little due to the fact you have to wait for your turn to really choose any action. There are some very interesting decisions to make. It feels a little restrictive even though there are a lot of moving components.
Was very excited when I first heard about this game and after playing it several times the Lustra has worn off but little bit. It's not as rich with decision-making as I first thought But it is still a solid game

I expected to like this game, but really just didn't.  The dice mechanisms seemed cool on paper, but in practice it felt very clunky, and I did not enjoy the rhythm of it.  I enjoy a lot of games that use similar selection mechanisms (Yspahan, Grand Austria Hotel, Castles of Burgundy, La Granja), but not so much this one.  It also seemed to end before I could get much done.  I am reminded of the old joke "The food was terrible, and the portions were too small!"

RATING: 7
My Village is the ‘sequel’ to one of my favourite games ‘Village’.   Unfortunately it is not as good, not nearly as good.  This game is very much a multi-player solitaire.  The only interaction is in the way the actions are taken, through taking two dice from the communal dice pool, and through being first to get some of the communal cards. 
 
The dice you choose trigger cards in your tableau (Machi Koro style) or allow you to take a new card with that value from the common card display.

In this game it pays to specialise due to the way points grow exponentially with whichever path you choose to follow.

The game is not bad, and I enjoyed myself playing it, and at 25 Euro it was exceptional value at Essen.  But it doesn’t have enough to make you want more.  I would sooner play Village (especially with the excellent Village Port expansion).  I sold it on.

I liked it better than regular Village.  The person-killing mechanic is more involved and less exploitable.  Dice drafting is much more interesting than picking up resource cubes.  The game itself feels a bit more balanced, and I love the option for efficient engine building.  I would need to play it again to give it a higher score.

Was not a huge fan of regular Village, it had little replay value after trying the few varied victory paths. The death/time mechanic was quite fascinating, but the rest of the game was just routine. My Village left me with a similar feeling, with additional fiddly set up. Worth a romp once, but not an overnight stay.

Alapjaiban nem lenne rossz játék. Hangulatos tematikus egy csomó minden benne. A sztori leírogatás különösen jópofa, de sajna egy csomó fura dolog van benne. A legnagyobb fájdalom talán, hogy négy fővel nem tudom hogy tesztelték. Ilyet én még nem láttam más játékban, hogy szinte minden elfogyjon a játék 3/4-re és csak látszat akciókat lehessen csinálni. Persze lehet erre tervezni, de fura ez a fajta beszorulás. Négyen a szerencse is kezd nem szinkronban lenni a játékidővel. Az hogy mire sorrakerülsz a patkány 0 és 18 között bármennyit léphet minden, csak nem kalkulálható. És akkor ehhez jön egy 2 óra vagy afeletti játékidő. Ezeket mind egyben meg lehetne mondjuk javítani azzal, ha nem 18 emberig csak 14-ig játszanánk.
Nálam így az ambivalens kicsit átlag alatti kategória. Olyan amiben van egy csomó jópofa dolog, de pár furcsaság elrontja.
Ja és az ikon designt aki csinálta annak letörném a  kezét. 40 kártyát kéne átlátni úgy, hogy 1 négyzetcentis ikonnal van rajta, hogy mit tud, de cserébe a lap 90% üres.

RATING: 5
The theme of the original Village has been transplanted almost without changes to this dice selection game, and instead of drafting cubes for actions you now draft dice. That's pretty much where the close family resemblance ends, however. Here, the dice are used to create a personal victory point engine. Village is no especially interactive game, but My Village (quite true to its name) removes pretty much all of that interaction and lets everyone muddle along in their own private quarters. The lack of variability might be another problem but I'm pretty sure I won't play this enough to find out.

In seiner Wesensidee die von außen nach innen gedrehte Variante von VILLAGE, in der jeder nun patienceartig seine eigene Dorfwirtschaft pflegt mit dem (leider) Verlust jedweder Interaktion. In MY VILLAGE baut man auf einer sehr linearen Ebene einen siegpunktgenerierenden Motor aus Plättchen in der Auslage, die den halben Tisch einnehmen und die man mit beliebt gewordenen Würfelaktionen erwirbt und macht-halt-so-vor-sich-hin. Dabei wurden die einzelnen Bereiche aus VILLAGE in MY VILLAGE übertragen. Das ist zwar alles ganz nett und gefällig, bleibt aber auf einer geraden Linie einfach zu dimensional, um in seinem solitären Wesen bei mir persönlich und bei mehr als zwei Spielern am Tisch gegen andere Spiele eine echte Chance zu haben. Auch nicht gegen das bessere VILLAGE, mit dem es sich messen lassen muss. Es stellt sich mir im Schatten des großen Bruders tatsächlich die Frage nach dem Existenzsinn des Spiels. Als VILLAGE-Fan wird man beim Original bleiben, als Nicht-Dörfler wird man erst recht nicht zu MY VILLAGE greifen. Vielleicht wird hier tatsächlich der mehr autistische Spielertyp angesprochen, den das eingreifende Tun der Mitspieler kirre macht und unbehelligt spielen möchte.

Wow.   Really better than I thought it would be.   Every bit as good and tightly woven with the original.   A lot  like Discoveries to Lewis & Clark in that this is a great game in its own right and the games mechanically and thematically compliment each other.

A few negatives are that it is a little bit of a table hog and I had to pay import price.   I hope this one gets picked up by a publisher in the US.  I think many would like it.  It is a shame and confusing that it hasn't been yet. (10/27/15)

Truly different strategies are supported and even promoted by this game with fun and quick decisions and gratifying gameplay.   Nice to watch your village grow..  even if it has to die...

Interesting, but once may be enough. I heard it called a 'junior sandbox' game, and I did like the ebb and flow of getting to decide when to engage with different game systems. But the numbers are a clunky way to yoke systems together (e.g. 3 and 11 are for farming and school) and the pairing of numbers means often it doesn't matter what the dice say. (I played 2p. With more players I bet player order would matter more but then I would have been annoyed at my turn order depending on seating order.)

You buy card buildings and powers with dice, which gives you more cards and dice until you eventually grow strong enough to buy VP's

We already have village that has a minimum of luck. This game is basically Village with lots of luck and much less strategy.

Interesting dice drafting mechanic that you use to both acquire cards and also activate them once you build a tableau.  There are different strategies to explore, but I wish there was more variable setup.  Completely different than Village, so any comparison is misplaced.

Pretty good dice-drafter. Setup-level: Le Havre though. Which is to say, you COULD play it as-is out of the box, but it seems like it could be IMMENSELY improved by the addition of a quick-start insert. Also, the default insert is complete shit (although, as usual, not actually worse than the Alea Iacta Est insert), and the reaper standies in my copy are extremely flimsy. No other complaints.

Slightly worse than base village for me. I like the dice drafting, but at the end of the day it doesn't really have enough interesting decisions. You sort of just pick a thing to specialize in and then take the obvious stuff. You really only want one or at most two numbers on your production buildings, and then you just go hard in either selling goods, travelling, or churches. There might be another way to get points I forget. But since turns where you choose to get new cards don't also come with anything else all the work you did to make sure you have overlapping numbers feels like it doesn't pay off nearly enough. The administrative buildings and starter churches provide interesting bonuses but they mostly map to one or two strategies each so there's not really a decision of which one to get. Overall a somewhat weak but not terrible game.

Initial Rating: 5.5 (November 2016)

I like Village, so I was very keen to try the new game in the series, sadly, it didn’t click for us and I ended up very disappointed :/.

The rules aren’t complex, the game sequence is very easy to follow and explain but you have to explain every area so the game explanation can be done under 18 minutes. Playtime is around 2 hours with the full complement of players. I think it is best with 3 or 2 players, with more the downtime can be more than I’m comfortable with kind of game.

The game components are of good quality and the art is neat as well. The theme is ok, nothing really exciting though.

I was expecting a good game, but the gameplay let me down. On paper it sounds great, but in practice it is a dull game. 

In general, Village have a controlled luck factor, but in My Village, it seems the luck factor is much higher (with the action dice and with the rat die), a huge minus for me. You have to get the first player to have a better chance to get what you want and even then many times you won’t roll what you need, you can mitigate the luck with money and markers from your meeting place, but still it has a high luck factor. Once you choose a strategy you need to continue to develop that strategy, so the choices become obvious from that point onward and very limited towards the end. Also, from my limited perspective, the churches seem unbalanced. The one that allows you to keep all your VPs when the rats strike seems much more powerful than the others, but I concede I need more plays to verify this point. Still, it bothers me that the first player who can roll a 2 or a 12 can buy the church he wants and the other players won’t have the opportunity to do so, that is, I dislike that all players cannot follow the same strategy if they desire to do so, only luck and seat order are the factors that decide if you can buy what you want or not.

Choosing which dice to pick every turn can trigger some AP in players. This part of the game was very slow because players can’t plan in advance (when your turn comes around, the sum of the dice have changed a lot, even more if you are the last player). I guess you can improve with more plays, but it wasn’t nor challenging nor fun.

My Village is a very repetitive game, fun the first 20 minutes, boring the rest.

Bottom line, My Village is a shadow of its big brother game. It has much less strategy and much more uncontrollable luck. After a couple of turns, the choices becomes obvious and automatic so the game becomes very boring. The downtime and the playtime are too much for what the game offers. I will sell my copy ASAP. Mediocre game.

Similar to his big brother "village" theme, but not just dice version, the gameplay is quite different, using dice to activate action something like Troyes, and a bit lower interactions but i think it is still good enough, but the story points need to be accquired by using the village man consume the actions point, the rat invasion made the points lower, this point is quite challenging.

[floatleft][ImageID=2613941][/floatleft]First off, this is a very different game from [thing=104006]Village[/thing]. The two do have many similarities: theme, meeple death, and several categories to score. However, the decisions you make in the two games are very different.

My Village uses die selection to take actions, each round 2N white dice (standard d6's) and 3 black dice are rolled, where N is the number of players. On your turn you select two of the dice, for each black die you select you advance two time. Like in Village, time is a resource that will eventually cause you to lose meeples who then get interred in more-or-less glorious graves possibly earning you points. Once you have your two dice, you calculate your banner value which is the sum of the values your dice show. Then you have two options you can activate a single black banner on a card showing your banner value, or you can activate all white banners in your tableau showing your banner value. At the start of the game you will activate a lot of black banners because this will typically add a card to your tableau, flipped over so that it now shows a white banner granting you access to a new action. Once you've carefully built up a white banner engine, hopefully with many cards sharing the same banner value, you can start activating white banners to do things with the goal of earning VPs. I've swept quite a bit of detail under the rug, but that is more-or-less the flow of the game.

[center][ImageID=2728661 medium][/center]

There are some neat decisions in the game based around action efficiency. The central mechanism is fairly blunt in it's intent to make you choose between incremental tableau building and crank turning VP acquisition. However, there are enough small and satisfying decision points in which cards to draft, how to make use of the die values available to you, whether or not to focus on a particular scoring category, balancing absolute scoring potential with banner value synergy, and of course managing your time which ultimately drives the game to its conclusion. 

Players have a couple of ways to mitigate the luck of the dice. They have coins they can spend to increment/decrement a die value, and there is a building they can build which allows them to set a die to the value of their choosing. They can also claim start player which aside from giving them first crack at the dice will likely have come with a few points as well.

I was very pleased with the game, and would happily play it some more. I do fear that it would feel a bit samey after a couple of plays, but if that turns out to be incorrect then I could see this rising to an 8.

RATING: 6
The successor of Village and while it has some interesting mechanisms it falls flat against it's predecessor, especially when you play Village with the second expansion. Why? First, after one play it's just a presumption, but it looks that the game suffers from the same problem as Village - the market is just too powerfull (here: ?-market tiles allow powerful combo turns, other options simply cannot compete with; second, the new brown, unsafe victory points seem helplessly underpowered, even if you have multiple ways of aquiring them, in a 4P game you are loosing them so quick due to dying villagers and rat plagues that it's almost no use; third, you are again limited with church/monk and travelling victory points, so that a good producing-market player will always stay ahead over time - and for adding church/monk and travelling you still need the same amount of time as he does (although he is a lot quicker because of those damn ?-market tiles). I will try another game, but I don't think you are able to break the advantage of a market player, maybe with less players, but not with 4...

Played once. Being last place in a 3 player game is brutal. It was fun. Had a familiar feel while being completely different.  This is to Village ans Roll for the Galaxy is to Race for the Galaxy. Similar but different. I can see this getting played more in the future with the right group. Setup is a bit of a beast. A playmat would do wonders for table organization and setup. The game took a hair longer than I wanted to. Four seems a bit too many, but I could see this being best at 2.

Waaaaaaay too long for what it is. The game was fun for 45 minutes, and lasted over 2 hours. Even the 90 on the game box are twice as long as the game is fun for. Even worse, near the end, options are so limited that you play for breadcrumbs for the last fifth of the game.

The dice mechanism would have made a nice filler. I could care less about the time wheel.

Kingsburg + Village = ok. Not nearly as robust as Village, but a bit more open than Kingsburg. The ability to choose from a pool of dice and manipulate them with money means you can usually get what you want each turn, to a degree. I liked having to kill the oldest generation first in Village, which made for interesting tactical choices, and missed that mechanic here.

Village, the dice game. Actually surprisingly good. Same look and feel, but yet still different enough. Each player has his own village to expand and develop. Dice are thrown by the start player and each player selects two to determine his action(s). Choices! Options! Interesting!

Ein gutes Spiel. Thematisch gefällt es. Die Mechanik funktioniert super und es gibt verschiedene Strategien fürs Spiel die funktionieren.
Das Spiel dauert aber (wie das Mutterspiel) viel zu lange (eigentlich noch länger als das Mutterspiel). Mein Mitspieler hat bemängelt, dass er zu viele Möglichkeiten hat, was er in seinem Zug tun kann. Ich mag das und spiele gerne solche Spiele. Meiner Meinung hat man auch nicht sooo viele Möglichkeiten, da man ja an seiner Strategie festhalten muss... Meine ist aber wohl nicht aufgegangen, die von ihm schon :).

I'll give you the cons right off the bat. It takes up too much space on the table. It takes too long to play with 4 players (2-2.5 hours). It's too much of a sandbox game. In that respect, it reminds me of Caverna and Orleans (maybe that's a pro for some people). There isn't much player interaction at all, even with the dice drafting from a shared pool.

The main pro is the dice drafting with a combination of neutral and evil dice (the black dice that bring your workers closer to death). It is a cool mechanism even if it's implementation here leaves more to be desired.

After one play, I can't say for certain that the variability isn't up to snuff. Maybe the randomness in dice and contract cards is enough to impact your early decisions and things snowball from there. I hope so, because I hate games in which the opening moves become scripted.

RATING: 7.5
After several plays I've seen all the game has to offer. And then it feels more and more repetitive.
Same setup everytime, lacking of variance, five main ways to score points, from which you focus on one or two. The interaction with other players are minimal (compared to other euros) or have very little influence of your own game.

So what is left is a thorough designed mechanism with little replayability.

I have tried this game with both two and four players, and I do not recommend ever trying it with the full player count. However, as a two-player game I feel this really shines. I really love the dice pool mechanic as well as the engine-like way you build up those white banners. I've really enjoyed exploring the different strategies you can take, finding that even though you might think some are more powerful than others, it's all down to committing to your chosen strategy rather than finding that one ultimate one that's going to win it every time.

What makes the game not work with four players?
- Time. With four people trying to find that one good pick from the dice pool every turn, it's going to take forever. And this is going to happen regardless of whether you have AP prone players or not. 
- Being last player just blows. You almost never have a good option as the last player, and you wind up feeling like you're wasting your turn using your dice on the road as it is literally your main action for the round, same goes for taking the starting hand - you feel like you're wasting your turn when you take it.
- Rats. You can really get devastated from the rats as all three people in front of you might have to kill off one of their villagers one by one, more or less guaranteeing a rat infestation before you have a chance to take a single turn.
- You are not likely to get the starting player hand even if you want to. With that I mean that you need a specific dice total to even be allowed to take the starting player hand, meaning that if anyone takes it in the game, it's most likely one of the players ahead of you, meaning you're more likely to go from last player to second or third before you have a chance to be starting player.

What makes the game so much better with two players?
- Options. Since you get to pick twice from the dice pool, you will get at least that one good option and if the second one isn't really what you wanted, it's not your single action for that whole turn, and it feels less like a waste to spend it on the road or taking the starting hand.
- Predictability. I mean this in the best of sense. You have a chance to stay more on top of the rat situation and prepare for it before it happens.
- Time. It really takes significantly less time playing as two people, not just because of the scaled down death toll, but you tend to finish your planning when taking your first action. You know which dice combo you want to be left for your second action, and if it isn't, then you are more okay with using it for a more throw-away action.
- Player order isn't as punishing. Sure, the first player has more options, but as you can't use the same dice total for that many different actions you will find that you won't stay blocked from doing a specific action as the first player will need a different dice total very soon. Plus once that point total on the starting player hand reaches a certain point, you will want to take it for that alone.
- You get to do more. I've already said this in a way, but that alone makes games more enjoyable to me with two, as I as a player prefer to get to do more.

Overall I really enjoy the game, and it's going to stay in my collection probably for a long time, but I have learned my lesson. I might take a stab at three players just to see how that fares, but I will primarily, to the brink of exclusively pull it out with two.

myVillage is the gamer's version of Machi Koro and the clear upgrade path for MK players.  And yet that description does this game no justice... it looks purely tactical, and if you play this game without a clear strategy you will lose to the person who thought through their path to victory.

I have no reference point for the original.  I don't think it matters.  myVillage is one of my favorite surprises of 2015.

RATING: 7.75
The rules are simple, but most of the actions refer to the icons on the specific cards. Fortunately, they are quite intuitive. This dice version of Village maintains the theme, but changes the mechanisms completely, except for the death of the workers. It's about building an engine with cards that will allow you to score big. And even if it is a dice version, it is nowhere a lighter game than Village.

The dice selection and the blue/white actions mechanisms are the parts I liked more. The constant pressure of the rat track and the temporary points and the first player hand are other nice features.

My first disappointment was the duration, quite longer than that 60-90 min length promised by the box. There's not a lot you can do during the time between turns, that's why I don't recommend it for more than 3 players.

The game is not as open as it seems after reading the rules. The combinations are limited. That might affect replayability, but I have not gotten to hat point yet. 

Overall, it seems well balanced, but I think that does not happen with the bonus cards. They "seem" balanced on the paper, but the results suggest otherwise.

RATING: 7
I like the concept, using a diminishing dice pool to get a number that allows you to either acquire a new card or activate (if you've planned well) multiple cards that you’ve previously acquired. It all comes at a time cost that eventually kills off your meeples, meaning you're encouraged to spend turns re-acquiring lost capability, and that I'm less enamoured with - 2 steps forward 1 step backward as a game-system isn't that exciting. And I felt much the same about its ancestor, Village. There's a few pathways to take, probably led by your early numbers, and you'll want to maximise each with end-game scoring bonuses. Trying out these different pathways offers some replay, which is good obviously, and the game is different enough to enjoy it for what it is and warrant some exploration, but in the end, the restricted set of cards and powers is going to limit how far the game can take you. Halfway through my third game, it felt like I was starting to see the same things happen again, so I think it’s about run its course for me, though I enjoyed it enough through those plays.

Feels similar Village, but with different mechanisms that makes this stand apart. I don't know which I like better yet, but I think they both do the job. Replayability is good because of the slight setup randomness, and the different paths to victory points.

Good 2-player.

Not sure yet which one I prefer, this one or Village. It really bugs me that this game takes up so much space though... It'll be really hard to get to play this as often as I'd like because of this... Great start though and I absolutely love the artwork.

For now the game gets a penalty for taking up so much space. If I find a good solution I might change the rating.

Dice drafting instead of worker placement. Takes up quite some space and time during setup, but very enjoyable. It still keeps the "engine-building" aspect of the original game, but now you want to focus around few specific dice values, in order to activate multiple actions at once.

I think My Village is as good as Village. Some things it does better, other things are not.

The dice-activation mechanic works very nice and is really an asset for this game. There are different ways to alter your luck with these dice so there is no reason to complain you got unlucky.

What I also like a lot is that you can get a lot of (potential) points from people telling tales. But as long as these tales are not written down, and the plague causes a few deaths (oh yes, people still die ;) ) some of these tales (points) will get lost.

But there are a few downsides as well in my opinion. One is that the game is more difficult than Village, probably because you can't grasp the theme that easily. Village is almost self explanatory, while the cards in this game seem to give a much more abstract feeling to it and you have to have a look on what the effects of those cards are. And because it is a sandbox game that causes quite some downtime. You never get forced (or being lead) to make specific decisions. You just can do whatever you want.
And because of that it also lacks replayability, just like it's predecessor. Once you found an optimal way to play it you can use that strategy over and over again and get bored quickly.

Bottomline: it's still a game that is well put together. But I will never introduce the game to new people.

I love Village and I really wanted to like this game, but I don't. I find the overall design - game mechanics and artwork - to be both dull and messy. The Village theme itself feels pasted on. I think better editing would have improved this game, because in it's current state it neither plays or feels very interesting.

RATING: 7.5
I like Village, so I was eager to play this. Only one play (with 2) and that's what I feel for the moment:

++ plays more smoothly and is therefore quicker then My Village
++ There are enough ways to manipulate the dice, something I find important in more strategic dice games like My Village.
+ I like the new concept of the story points which aren't safe unless you invest some actions in it. With 2 players that rat comes fast, very fast
+- Almost everything costs time. It makes your villagers will die quite fast and you'll need to invest in the school-action. Were in Village I have the feeling I can pace down the rate at which my villagers die, here I don't have this feeling. Off course, as they die quite fast, the game is also finished more quickly.
- Only 1 minus as I'm not sure yet, but travelling seems to be an easier way to get points then the other options.
- If you've played Village a couple of times, you won't have a wow-feeling of this one as a lot of the mechanisms feel similar. But I must admit that the implemenation of the dice mechism is very cool. 
-- In My Village every action is always available (as long as you have a villager that is). One of the things I like in Village is just the fact that every action is only available a limited number of times and you have to decide an order of chosing your actions. This increases the AP-level, but is one of the main things I enjoy in Village and I'm missing in My Village.

I can't say I am excited by this game. I wasn't excited by Village and didn't really enjoy it even. I guess I liked My Village better since it is faster but I felt it was a bit forgettable.

This is an ok dice selection game that sort of combines Machi Koro with Village. The biggest problem with the game is the aspects that try to be Village. It sort of apes the interesting things Village has going for it, without taking any of the pieces that were actually interesting. I don't mind this game, but I don't see ever wanting to play it over Village.

What a nice surprise! A very good game with clever use of dice for taking actions and cards. There are familiar elements to Village yet the game plays completely different making it more than what one would think at first glance, that it is a simple spin off of Village. There are also many paths to victory, you are left to find a way to be most efficient.

For what was a medium game, there seemed to be a lot of detail to take in, or is that just the christmas whisky taking its toll.
Our first game, went on a little longer than i think everyone playing thought it should have.  Normally in medium euros i can think back to a strategy that would improve my score.  In this instance, with so many choices and those options restricted by dice rolls, I came away just thinking, oh.

My Village suffers from being a table hog with a long setup time and a problem where subsequent players can't properly plan while other players go (as the dice values available by the time its your turn could change drastically).  

Once the game is going it can be fun, but it lacks variability and the same old strategies can work every game.

First off, let me say that I am a huge fan of Village. The game is great and we went into My Village with high expectations. 

However, this game lacks severely in two areas that Village excels in.

1) In Village it feels like each area of the board is very different from each other. In My Village, each area ends up feeling kind of samey. The journey cards and the church cards feel almost identical. 

2) In Village it always feels like there is something productive to do, at the very least you are going to be getting a cube that you want. In My Village, there are times when you will just have nothing good to do and you have to waste a number of turns to build back up. Where the tension in Village grows throughout the game, the tension in My Village can tank when you have several turns in a row with nothing productive to do.

Not a short game, but very enjoyable and does not overstay. Rules explanation takes 20-30 minutes? Fantastic production and graphic design!

------
[url=https://www.boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/207536/item/4565376]1st play[/url]

An hour for rules -- whew, somewhat complicated! Actually, not complicated but rather that there's just a lot of stuff to go through. Once you go through it, the basic game mechanisms are pretty straightforward and the production is great: clear iconography, easy to understand how stuff works.

This takes the theme of the original game but transforms it to a dice-driven version that, I think, is simpler to play than the original. To set up, you lay out the 80 or so cards out into a specific display. These are in several types/colors, with matching colors on player boards. Players get some starting money (based on turn order). As for all other resources, money is tracked by putting generic markers in a specific (coin) location of your play area. 

Each round, the start player rolls 3 black d6 + (2n+2) white dice. In turn order, you select a pair of dice (every black die moves your time counter ahead 2 spaces). Use the sum of your dice to activate one or more locations on your board, acquire a card from the display, take the Start Player token, etc. At the end of your turn, if your time marker has completed one circle around the track, someone dies -- send one of your workers (you started with 5 on your board, one of each type) to the graveyard (12 VP-spots available, depending on type of worker; otherwise generic unmarked grave). 

The game ends at the end of the round after X workers are killed (X varies by player count). Players earn points for a variety of things: VP chits stashed during the game, point values of cards acquired and activated, etc. 

Our game took just over 2 hours, but I don't think it would be so long on repeat play. I like the way the dice rolls are used here, with some way to mitigate "bad luck" by buying a variety of tiles (to cover more numbers) or manipulate the dice rolls (with a specific card, or with money, or by taking Start Player and getting first choice). I would definitely play this one again!

My rating is probably colored by a less than optimal experience.  We played with 4, and it was crazy slow.  Still, I found this to be less clever than I'd like from a Euro.  I found the dice placement lacked tension unless I was going last, and there was always something decent to do that would gain me some points.  It's an exercise in efficiency, and while I usually those once, as I did here, I'm not likely to want to play again without some particularly clever/original mechanic or a depth of strategy that I feel is lacking here.  This game exemplifies why I enjoy playing Euros, and why I'm not super impressed with most of them that come out right now.

Great game.  Really enjoy it; prefer it over Village.  It suffers a little in the replayability category I think though as a result of what I think is a foremost/dominant strategy, although you can't win overall with a singular focus.

tl;dr: fun variation

I haven't played [thing=104006][/thing] a lot, but when playing this game I did see a number of shared elements. But this is a nice medium weight strategy game that can stand on it's own. And there are some elements that are quite different from the other game, so it's not a case of 'which of the 2 should I get'. They're different enough.
In any case, I enjoyed playing this game. It's not too complex, it doesn't take too long, but it does offer some fun strategic or tactical choices.

Initial rating: 7/10
BGG scale: 7/10

RATING: 6.5
A promising enough game, but I seriously suspect that the same issue occurs here as with the original 'Village' - in that if 2 players rush the end game, much of the slower developing strategies don't have time to come to fruition - which in turn means that all players are forced to play the quick scoring approaches and so much of the game becomes irrelevant.

The dice allocation and selection was a nice addition though.

I'm a big fan of Village, and was initially very intrigued by My Village, which sports such a similar theme. However, as the novelty wore off, I found that the dice mechanic felt more like an obstacle to what I wanted to do in the game rather than a fun, challenging feature. The dice selection process also seemed to bog the game down for players at times. Verdict: I'll stick with the original Village.

[thing=172381][/thing] passes the same core idea of that of [thing=104006][/thing]: actions that use time, and this will eventually cause the death of workers - the first to die might be remembered (giving points) while the later ones will go to oblivion and unmarked graves - sad. Also, the same idea of workers going to the church, to the City Hall, to voyages, to create stuff (animals or tools) in order to fulfill demands of the market, is in here.

While the core is the same, playing is different: now players use dice to make actions - either to take cards of the activate them. Taking cards or using some actions on the personal board are one use only for the dice taken - but the twist of the game is that multiple "white" actions can be activated with the same pair of dice; allowing strong combos after some preparation - is very satisfaying to see the plans coming together. There are some race to gather cards - since many have different effects and/or different numbers to activate. Yet, isn't taking cards first that usually wins the game, but rather using them in better ways.

However, [thing=172381][/thing] expands the concept, delivering a game about the same weight, but much more fiddly, with several types of decks that should be prepared apart and many small effects of different cards, even in the same type. These add time - the thing that will get you killed. Time to set up all the cards in their places - taking a huge amount of table space in the process. Worst is the time demanded in learning the game: as in order to play you will need to know the different effects of cards (such as the churches, the city halls, the priests, the meeting squares, etc). It took quite a bit of explaining, and I dread the thought of sitting at the table while, already knowing the game, waiting for someone new to it learn it.

Thus, [thing=172381][/thing], even with it being a very good game - balanced (even more than the base [thing=104006][/thing]), clever, filled with options, strategies and paths to victory, with the bonus of having an amazing art -, the added time makes me not want to play it again, if not in the correct situation: with everyone already knowing the rules; which is quite rare, considering the size of our group and that often the player vary.

In the end, the elegance of [thing=104006][/thing] beats the mechanically stronger [thing=172381][/thing], by also being more friendly and agile. Yet, in the right conditions, [thing=172381][/thing] will still hit the table.

Final Thoughts:
The dice placement is something I had high expectations of, but it doesn't matter that much. You can always do something which is useful to you. That's a good thing, but it also makes for a game without too much tension. Meh.

There are many cards spread out over the table and one by one you add them to your plateau. For me it's easy to get lost there, let alone keep attention to the other side. I forgot to activate some of my own cards and left perfect dice untouched. Confusion!

My biggest gripe with My Village is the theme. The game is about telling stories. That's a wonderful theme. The stories are supposedly about the people who live and die in My Village, but those people are anonymous and faceless. Not for a moment I had the feeling that some story was unfolding. In the end My Village is a highly abstracted game we simply don't care for. Still we'll give it another go or two, because we like to explore the game and maybe we have overseen the hidden beauty of it.

Sold.

—————————

Good, not great. I like it, not love it. Why? And why? 

My Village is a good game because the mechanics work, after one play everything is very clear, there are multiple paths to victory, there's a bit of competition for the dice. 
But it's not a great game because there's no connection between theme and mechanics, victory points seem arbitrary, no story is being told so in the end every play is forgettable.
It plays fine with two and that's a reason to keep this game for a while. I have also bought the mini expansion and maybe that will give some spice to the game.

I was really excited to play this game.  I love dice placement games, but I love dice drafting games even more.  I was also really taken with the theme of a growing and passing work force.  The game just felt pretty dull and dragged on though.  Felt like it took way too long to make your plans come to fruition.  The game ends and you've barely only accomplish walking down a path and putting some priests in windows.  Also the dice and first player rotation wasn't mitigated enough, I was regularly frustrated by not being able to do the things I want to do because of the dice left for me.  I love when Dice create a random element that you have to plan around, but in this game they just serve to limit your options.    Probably what was most frustrating to me was that the only way to get out of a last player rut, was by getting the dice you need to take first player back... but again you're at the mercy of other player's leaving you what you need to even do that.

Really nice little game where you can build an engine via several paths. Dice drafting, resource management and set collection mostly.

I haven't played Village in years. My sole play was a prototype game at BGG.con years ago. I played My Village at BGG.con 2015 and felt like it was long for what it was. We decided to play it 2P a year later.

Maybe I would have enjoyed it more had I not just played Lorenzo il Magnifico, a game I feel fires My Village by doing almost everything My Village does (building an engine, dice drafting/worker placement) better in less playing time. Our game took around three hours between re-reading rules, setup, and playing 2P. Maybe we just played extremely slowly as I see the BGG playtime is less. It definitely isn't a bad game, just didn't feel worth the time commitment for setup/playtime.

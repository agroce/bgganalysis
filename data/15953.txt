Logan likes this game better than the regular set, because he has trouble flying aircraft. We played this cooperatively (both of us going against balloons). I was shot down, he blew up a balloon and escaped. Lots of fun, and a good gateway game into the series.

First played against Baron Philip von Williams, of Birmingham, but in Germany (go figure). Aged just 13, the Baron whupped my posterior all around the Black Forest whilst on holiday. His father Robert just watched and shook his head slowly...

Good game this one.

Playing solo ... sure I prefer to play with others, but this version of Wings of War allows me to go at it alone. Cool. I used to play and love Blue Max back in the day (yes I'm that old) and that's what initially attracted me to this game. Wings of War is different than the old Blue Max, and it's better! It's a great game if this sort of stuff blows your hair back. I prefer the WWI versions to the others, but that's just my personal preference. Recommended!

The game can probably be fun, but you need the crowd to play it, I tried playing it with my son, and we didn't get it. Maybe we should have taken more time to re-check the rules and retry, but it really didn't get us after a game. Now traded.

RATING: 9.9
Not even properly played yet, but the design of the game - the simplicity of it's gameplay as well as the gorgeous art on the cards - just shines. Probably close to perfection.
-update- Perfection is just an idea. Played with 5 non-gamers in a party setting - that didn't work as well as I expected: pretty chaotic and random maneuvering. I can see now that it takes some dedication and concentration and possibly a quieter, more focused setting for a first game, in order for new pilots to recognize the brilliant design of WoW.

Adds some great fun without adding complexity (a good thing for my crowd).  We put an ex-Army pilot as the anti-air commander trying to defend the Drachens.  Of course he shot down his own side's Albatross.  Priceless!  Man it's rewarding shooting down a giant balloon.

Wings of War will certainly attract the aviation and history fans, but other players will love it, too. The game has the advantage of relying on simple and immediate rules, which can really be learned by playing. A match lasts few minutes. The miniatures are beautiful and well made​​. I saw Wings of War for the first time in the window of a shop, when I was often dealing with aviation topic and I was attracted by reproductions of IWW models. In fact, initially I thought the miniatures were there to be sold to collectors, and not parts of a game! You have to try Wings of War!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Close Combat airplane game. The game uses a fictive board made up on the table where the planes have to stay inside in order not to lose. The planes move with the help of cards in different ways and can perform different maneuvers to try and tail their opponents to be able to shoot them down. It's pretty simple but proved alot of fun in trying to second guess your opponents strategy. The planes moves in turns of 3 each round which have to be decided before hand aswell as being blind to your opponent. Planes move at the same time each turn and after both have moved you determine wether they are in range to fire at each other. if they can fire a number of damage cards will be drawn by your opponent to determine how well you hit. First to reach their planes total damage amount will lose the game and be shot down.

Easy to learn and proved to be fun

I loved this game as soon as I played it. Since I'm an air combat buff, it was always likely to push the right buttons. The miniatures improve the game fairly drasticly though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.3
Expansion which adds quite a lot to the WoW game. The zeppelins add some variety and the altitude rules bring the game closer to a simulation than the original rules. Downside with the extra challenge when using the altitude rules it that it lengthens the game considerably. This also makes the possible early player elimination a real issue. Still I'd rather play with the added complexety of altitude than without. A must have expansion for fans of the game.

I don't know what it is recently, but this is another tough game for me to rate. On the one hand, Wings of War finally delivers on its full potential with ground targets, interesting fixed objectives, decent scenarios, and a wide and interesting variety of planes. For that, along with the very well-done altitude optionals, it should get a 10.

It doesn't though because it seems to have lost the focus and elegance it originally had with Famous Aces and Watch Your Back. No more just throwing out some planes and playing; you've got to figure out the scenarios, look up the rules for rockets or incendiary ammo, figure out which damage symbols matter when, and figure out the ground fire rules. It's really not complicated, but this is a game I don't play very often (although I always enjoy it when I do), and a cheat sheet for a few things would have been helpful (as would having the stats for the altitude rules on the plane cards).

Bottom line, though, if you like Wings of War you should definitely get Burning Drachens because it takes the system from being a pleasing diversion to being a complete package.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Wings of War is a spectacularly fun, simple game.  A great game for anyone (even non-gamers), it's a blast and has only a few simple rules.  Very tense and causes many laughs due to pre-planning maneuvers.

There's just enough meat to be interesting.  The most attractive aspect is the degree to which all excess chrome, fluff, and other extraneous chaff has been be excised to leave pretty much as minimal a game as could be managed.  My refinement of Mike Chase's variant (see article) further improves that quality.  The surprising thing is that while the maneuver choices are essentially akin to blind bidding, that the impact cost of those decisions is low enough, and the game short enough that what emerges is quite surprisingly and susiciously fun.

A bit slower of a game than I had originally thought it would be.  However, we only played the simplified rules to get used to the game play before we moved into some of the more interesting rules.

This is the third game in the WINGS OF WAR series.  This one includes advanced rules, which include AAA, MG fire, Trench fire, strafing, bombing, recon and balloon busting missions, to name only those.  You will also find interesting rules on altitude and clouds!  I still prefer the simplicity of the altitude rules and flight constraints in CANVAS EAGLES.

If you'd like to see what the WoW series is like, this is the game to get.

This one can be played by 1-2 players, thus solo play is possible.

And yes, it meshes very well with the other two games in the series.  Now all we need is a bigger box to store all the  pieces!

This is a great little head-to-head biplane game.  It incorporates differences between some planes, and maneuvering strategy of dog-fights. It is easy to learn, and straight forward to play.  

The downside is that the cards are not as inspiring (but much cheaper) than the miniatures.  I would also recommend not using the altitude rules untill all players have had 3-5 games played.  

Good game, and a good entry into WWI arial combat.  I strongly recommend getting some miniatures if you like this game.

After trying Dawn of war and enjoying it, I picked up the three WW1 games.  I think that the original WWI system is even better than the newer WWII system. (but just barely)  Famous Aces is the first module I'd suggest you pick up if you want a 2-4 player game.  The Flying Drachens set adds in more detail including ground attack missions, elevation rules, balloons, ground based machine guns and artillery units, and rules for solo play, BUT is limited to 2 players out of the box, and I 'd pick it up first if I were planning on only playing solitaire or two player.

Initial Rating: 4.0 (October 2012)
 
As I don’t like the base game, it is no surprise I don´t like this standalone/expansion. As I have only played it once, I´m not sure what exactly this adds to the game. If it adds a little complexity, that would be a plus for me as I feel the game to be very simple.

In a nutshell, I don´t like the theme and I feel the mechanics are clumsy. Not enough fun for me.

Still, not a game I´m willing to explore further, but I´m pretty sure I will play it again because many of my friends like it.

If you like Wings of War, perhaps this is a worthy addition.

**A fun, light, dog fight game with style.**

First off, I must come clean: I have loved playing the 'Wings of War' system and this is a good expansion that deepens the game a bit. 

The burning drachens puts me in perfect mind of an old wire frame arcade game, "The Red Baron" that I loved. What can I say? These games are just fun. 

I like the new altitude rules for missions, but I tend to drop them when just dog-fighting with friends.

As a whole, this is one of my favorite gaming systems for clean and fun dog-fighting. 

I'm also looking forward to seeing some of the minatures being released and I think they'll look fantastic on the table.

I love a lot of things about this game. The theme is appealing and the mechanics are very novel. You move around the tabletop flying your plane and trying to out manoeuvre your opponent. The down side is that the rules are fairly fully featured (i.e. a bit long) and since I don't get a chance to play often this makes it hard to get to the table. Admittedly this is my fault...

I want to play this more, the rating would likely go up. I can't really comment on this game in the context of the WoW series. I played Famous Aces once and had a blast, this one only plays up to 2, but includes solo stuff to it seems to fill a niche.

The balloon cards are lovely, and I like the idea of the new rules; however, a reference card (available on the Geek) is probably necessary to keep track of all the picayune rules. If you don't like WoW at all, this set won't change your mind. If you like WoW but wish it had a bit more meat to it, you'll likely want this, as it gives you balloons, AA guns, AA machine guns, trench fire, altitude rules, and some new scenarios. This one does allow for some solo play, and the additions make this a better "second" set (after Famous Aces) than Watch Your Back! The smaller number of players accommodated (2, as opposed to 4) makes this less desirable as a "first" set, though.

RATING: 7
Combined with 4 1st-series miniatures (decks 1 to D), you get a very nice set of components.  It is nice to have these big balloons for scenarios.  If you get your hands on an Ufag C.I 2-seater, you can play all the scenarios from the rule books (Famous Aces and Burning Drachens), except for the few ones that involve Watch your Back!  Or, if you're ready to adapt the scenarios by switching sides, you can buy an Allied DH4 mini and replace the Ufag C.I from the scenarios.

This is the only version of Wings of war I tried. Played once and without any scenario. We were fighting Plane VS plane. I found this game to be tedious and almost totally random. It's easy to fly the whole game without firing at your opponent. I found the token (printed on both sides with different icons) to be a mess to use. Also the fact that the smallest shake of table/breeze/breath and cause the plane to move/turn/shift is very annoying when you play.

I think the scenario would give better play value since you would have a specific goal that your opponent try to twart (instead of just dodging the other plane). 

I wanted to like this game but it felt short.

Fun in short bursts. Simple, but with several optional rules and scenarios.

The minis look great, but my interest in WoW came from its use of cards as the miniatures themselves.

As a novice with just the one box, I found it annoying to separate cards which are unusable without buying more packages in the series. It's 1/3 of the cards and a speed bump to getting started. It also gives the impression of being a crass sales ploy.

I prefer the original version of Wings of War - Famous Aces (i.e. WWI).

The new cards are laminated and very slippery - the linen finish was a much better design.  We played a straight forward 2 on 2 dogfight and I felt the German planes were vastly inferior to the UK force.  The options for high and low speed seem unnecessary to me; the strength of this game is in fast paced turns.

RATING: 7
06/26/06 Received. Many have complained this isn't a whole game; that you are almost forced to buy other games in the series to have enough planes and maneuver/damage decks to play a “sensible” game. The answer isn't a straight yes or no, but falls into that gray area in between. You *can* play Wings of War with just one of these sets, but its rather unsatisfying and very limiting. I initially bought Watch Your Back! and Burning Drachens but then felt I *must* buy Famous Aces to have what many players would call a complete set. Is this sneakiness on the part of the publishers, or simply economic reality (what you can realistically put in one box for a reasonable price). Probably a little of both.

This game really scratches the itch for a light, accessible and quick playing war game.  It is incredibly compelling.  It takes only a few minutes to explain (the basic rules); can be played in a half hour or less; is customizable with minis; and really lends itself to getting involved in the storyline of the mission.  Oh, and let's not forget that it is great as a solitaire game as well!

[played thrice]

As expansion I'd rate it more: good artwork as usual, nice add-ons (balloons, rockets and AA guns). I like very much AA guns. However I'm not very fond of altitude rules and usually I don't play with them.
But the box itself is playable only by 1-2 players... I think that WoW loses something when played by few people, so my vote is lowered a bit.

This game is totally fun.  I would say that it simulates a WWI dogfight as my childhood imagination sees them.  The basic game is great, you can pull out the game and start fighting in minutes.

The solo scenarios are a plus for when you don't have any opponents, but this game is so easy to learn that finding someone to play usually isn't a problem.

RATING: 8
A simpler game than it appears, but highly addictive, Wings of War makes another utterly convincing argument for using cards as the basis for what would otherwise be a miniatures game (though they do produce miniatures separately for those as want them). 

This base game is relatively inexpensive, quick to play, easy to teach and easy to learn, even with the extra rules included in this version, such as ground fire and altitude. Those extra rules make for an acceptable trade off compared to the other two boxes, which, while less comprehensive, allow four planes to be flown instead of just the two.

I'm very impressed with what this has in the rulebook. Rules for incorporating altitude, balloons, different types of ground fire, and various mission types are present. The game looks sharp, and offers more rules and options than Watch Your Back, though I'm glad I have them both.

I've only ever played 2 player games with each player controlling only one aircraft. I don't have much of a desire to play it that way again. However, I'd love to play with more players in large dogfights, but don't have the opportunnity right now. So it'll continue to sit on my shelf until some ace pilots happen to come along.

See WoW - Famous Aces.

Where Burning Drachens allows you to get away with flying one plane per side in a two player game because there's so much other stuff involved - gun emplacements, primarily - those scenarios normally aren't out-and-out dogfights. If you're playing straight-up Famous Aces, I strongly suggest y'all play with two planes per player. It gives you more to do in the planning phase, adds some tactical depth to gameplay, and drastically reduces the tedious looping and weaving required to set up a good shot when you only have one aircraft. (People say "well, that's what it was like in real life," but nobody said those guys were having fun, either.)

Edit: I have all four big boxes now; they're all worth your time.

ok little game of airplane dogfights.
I found it a little sterile and frankly one play was enough.

RATING: 5
I felt like this should have been more fun.  It's actually a total pain in the ass to keep track of where planes are and what they are doing.  A lot of bookkeeping and fiddliness for not a lot of reward.

You spend half the time flying in circles hoping to catch the occassional glimpse of your opponent so you can fire.  Sometimes your hits are deadly, sometimes useless.  Either way, I'll pass.

My only complaint is that it's easy to nudge the cards by accident. Don't play the game with anyone who's overly competitive as a result.

Or play using the heavier miniatures.

A great game when not played too frequently. Excellent teamplay for four and more players. 

All the Wings of War games are recorded under this label.

Really love pretty much everything about these games other than it takes a specific kind of person to get to play it with me.  I just wish I could find them.

Played two solo games. WoW is more entertaining against human opponents. It is better with the interaction. 

Burning Drachens is, of course, also a dogfight game for two players, but for this the four player boxes are much better (Famous Aces, Watch Your Back). The components are nice and should support some new scenarios for games of FA/ WYB, so it is more an expansion than a game. 

Using altitude rules, balloon busting was fun, although I lost. Strafing was less exciting because without considering altitude, there is less to think about.

Great game fun with just the cards but way better with the models. A lot of players (4 or more) to make this a satisfying game. Has since been cancelled and replaced with WINGS OF GLORY

You get a lot of stuff in this box; the big balloon markers are especially nice. I don't know if I like the altitude rules too much, but they are optional anyway. I've tried the scenario where a ballon is attacked and needs to be lowered in the nick of time.

I really like this game, but already after two plays I know I need to add more planes.

RATING: 10
Fantastic game system and mechanism. Remind me of the good old child days when playing on the floor with my toy planes. It is possible to play all from very simple games to very complex war games and it works fine - at least for us - to play without the miniature planes and just use the plane cards. You can easily create your own scenarios and campaigns and add new home-made components if you like (I do!). Only downside is that you quickly want to have all the expansions but I will recommend you to spend your money on them before starting to collect the miniature planes - the game works very well without having them (the miniature planes)

 more new planes and balloon busting! Also alltitude rules, if playing this the game comes alot trickier as climbing and diveing take a long time and it is difficult to engage planes at differing alltitude

A nice final set to round out the series and you can play solo taking shots at the balloon targets.  Still looking forward to the aircraft packs but for now this adds a few more to the mix. Fantastic graphics BTW.

Standalone or expansion this one truly hits the mark.

I've only played a solo game with the blimps and ground gunnery but boy was it fun.  I wasn't able to finish but I had destroyed one blimp and needed to destroy another.  It was going to be close.

I haven't had a chance to try to altitude rules but they look fun.  Although it does seem like it takes a while to change to a different level.  I don't think any of our games would last long enough to make it.

Overall this adds some good complexity to this awesome game.

RATING: 8
Rated in kind with primary 'Wings of War' game.  Gameplay nearly identical, but game does lose some marks for only coming with 2 'play boards' (a handy board for keeping track of +1 damage sets, status markers, and keeping maneuver cards in neat order) while other games in the series all have 5.  The addition of a bunch of VERY unique units (AA guns, ground targets, and observation balloons) otherwise redeem this.

I think to enjoy this game to the fullest you need the miniatures - the more planes the better. Fun though the few times I played - even without the miniatures but I am waiting until I find a deal on the little suckers before I try it again.

Fun to play, something like Robo Rally. The only problem at least in 1 on 1 play that it can drag or finish very early. 

Still to play with some additional rules like altitude.

It's fun but somehow I don't want to play it anymore. Sold

Love it. Still never get round to using altitude. Seems too cumbersome. My son has played about 3 games and my wife one. Not seen the table for over a year but hope to get it out at one of our neighbours parties

Edit: Now own 9 beautiful minis too but they get in the way so never leave their boxes.

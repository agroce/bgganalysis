I love this game,
but I find it a bit heavy for other people trying it that they don't seem to get excited like I would like them to. 
I'm gonna be trying the game a lot more this upcoming year and hopefully I can have a really good review soon.

I wanted to buy Bloodbowl, but since its out of print I bought KB instead. Plays fast, and has some strategy to it. 
It´s true what people say, its really an area control game. But it works great. 
The races feels different enough, a match doesn't go on forever and the minis are beatiful. 

Slightly chaotic game that doesn't take it self too serious. Need to play more though.

A [i]much[/i] better game than I thought it would be when I backed the Kickstarter. The game play video made it look dry and kind of boring, but the game choices cause just enough anxiety, especially when the period limits and card-play limitations are parameters that govern the choices. If I had known how much I would enjoy it, I would have gotten all the teams when I pledged.

Having played nearly all the teams and with many different people, we love this game. The more we play, the more tactics and strategy we get into. Sure, there is some luck of the deck, but that works both ways. I believe that this is a well-balanced fun game that people of many different backgrounds will enjoy.

Minis are great, time to play a match is great.  Strategy feels a little soft, a little too light and a little too dictated by a common card deck.  The very few turns per period means that many of the players barely move.  

Will continue to play to see if my opinion changes.

Tentative rating:
I haven't played a full game yet (my opponent still doesn't feel ready to play with the drafting rules) but I've still quite enjoyed the card play, hand management, planning, and tactical nature of the game.

When reading the rules I thought it was odd that scoring mounds give greater number of points as the game goes on. After playing I like that aspect a lot. If dealt a bad hand in the first period it gives you an opportunity to sculpt a better one and not fall behind by too much at all. 

Looking forward to more plays and giving it a more solid rating.

Excellent components, streamlined rules and plenty of tactics to go.

The dead cards are a brilliant mechanic, making Kaosball have a little Cosmic Encounter feel.

2017-06-14: Not my style of game. Lots of confrontation, lots of randomness in the cards and taking lots of time. 
I have one 'problem' with Scythe, and that is the fighting. This game is almost ONLY that part of Scythe. :D

I remember liking Blood Bowl a lot in the 90s, but I think I might have grown out of that too now.
Also, playing 1 vs 1 is probably better than 3 players. 

Initial rating = 4 (I realize this is probably a decent game at least, but this is SO not my style!)

Another one of those future-sport-and-lots-of-dice Ameritrash games. I tend to loathe square-grid dice games, and though I am a sports fan, I find most sports board games tiresome. The figures are nice enough, but I don't need figs to enjoy a game.

The game itself just didn't do it for me. Someone please design a clever American football game that doesn't involve wizards and robots...

If I am going to play a game that is about fantasy sport then this is the one I want to play.  Unfortunately, between the theme and the art (which I don't mind) a lot of my friends (and my fiancee) don't want to play it :(

Personally - I really like it!  As is typical with Eric Lang, it's really not as Ameritrash as it looks...  It's actually kind of an abstract game with your standard CMON chrome (although the minis aren't actually as good as a modern CMON game)

I don't have anything like this, so it'll fill a nice hole in my collection.

I'll probably go all in after the campaign ends, and get all the teams, and possibly another board to try out the league play.

Two sculpts per team isn't the greatest, but it's certainly understandable why it was done this way. It looks fun, and original.

I didn't add any extra teams, and just stuck with my base $100 pledge. The teams shouldn't be hard to get hold of at retail for cheaper.

I just got my pledge, and I seriously regret not going in for all 18 teams. Hind sight is always 20/20.
Even though I 'only' have 7 teams, I feel that's enough to get a really good feel for how this plays.

This is a piece of exquisite work. Just the right amount of luck, with bluffing, insane combos, and strategy in a fast and furious chaotic romp across the pitch.

I can't get enough of this...I want to play all the time.

Now I really, really regret not getting all of the teams with my pledge....

Now that this game is so unpopular, I can complete my collection for super cheap. It still holding a 10 for me after so many years because this really isn't a sports game.
It's a clever area-control game with bidding and bluffing, disguised under a sports veneer. This is one of the coolest looking and most fun area control games ever. If you love area control, and can get past the theme here, you will love this game.

I always suggest 2 player games over 4, as 3 or more players increases the chaos too much to make the experience pleasurable. When playing against a single opponent, it's much more tactical.

There are some imbalances in the teams. But, experienced players should be able to use the weaker teams against new players and still win. The Amazons are disgusting no matter what, and only let new players use them, as they are overpowered against almost every other team.

Fast paced, love the 'war' card aspect. There's also neither a playbook nor a need to use one. Other than Goblins, the teams won't struggle to score points.

Tremendous production quality and a surprisingly tactical implementation of a fantasy sports game.  It has a lot of variety with ringers, teams and team abilities (magnetic aspect is awesome).  What at first looked to be a re-implementation of the old Hasbro game Battleball proved a better!

RATING: 4
Almost kinda fun based on themes, but ultimately a mess. The card mechanic makes it possible to get saddled with a useless hand for turn after turn. The "ball" is almost an afterthought in the gameplay, and the overall randomness makes any type of real strategy difficult. 

If this was an easy-to-learn, 30 minute game, that might be acceptable, but it's too long and too clunky to be fun.

Fantasy rugby. The initial bidding/drafting mechanic is great to add some extra powers or special players to your team. The cheating mechanic is great and matches the theme and adds some kaos to the mix.

Worst Kind of Ameritrash there is. The basic idea of a sports game similar to american football, with teams consisting of fantasy creatures, sounded appealing but the implementation of this is awful. 
The miniatures are nice to look at, but there are only 2 variations per team (3 if you count the useless score marker) and are totally superfluous and only exist to raise the price rip off the customer.
The contest mechanism where each player chooses a card, but cannot chose a value already played is extremly broken. There are multiple times when players can't use any card to win a contest because of this. Players are at the mercy of deck to get any playable card at all.
The different teams and their special abilities are horribly unbalanced and there are a lot of conflicting abilities and effects that need to be cleared up. Unfortunately the mediocre rulebook does a bad job at doing this. Because of this we had several heated arguments during gameplay. 

Everything wrong with ameritrash games is prevalent in this game. Avoid at all cost, so miniature companies won't be able to make loads of money on kickstarter to sell poorly designed games as an excuse for overpriced minis.

Worst new game i've played for a long time.

Don't bother with the ball. You don't need it for points anyway...

Got a hand full of '1' cards? Oh, well... just watch your guys all die.

Guys dead? Oh well, nothing you can do this 1/4 - ah, and the other guy gets 12 points for killing them too.

Maybe, maybe could be OK as a 2 player game - but as a 2v2 team game.... wow!! doesn't work.

Kaosball is a new kind of fantasy sports game, combining rugby-style passing finesse and first person shooter domination-style scoring. The result is a tense game of skill, bluffing, luck, and lethal brutality like you've never played before!

Brought to you by acclaimed designer Eric M. Lang, Kaosball uses exciting card-based play mechanisms to put players in the role of a coach, managing their unique, game-altering team from scrimmage to sudden death period to outscore their opponents. Players need to balance scoring and killing their opponents, using powerful cheating effects all the while – as long as you have the money to pay off the ref. No two matches will play the same!

First:

- If you're expecting GW or Reaper quality you're kidding yourself for this money

- If you're expecting a sports game it's not that at all, it's more of a combat game crossed with a king of the hill game

Talk about exceeding expectations! The miniatures are easily the best I've seen in anything other than FF stuff and the Ringers are multi-piece molds, so they're more detailed than that. The quality throughout is great and a few plays already shows the depth it has.

The game itself plays like a couple of multiplayer modes from first person shooters. One mode it plays like is king of the hill. If you can get a runner to remain on a scoring zone at the end of a round/period you get points. The other mode it plays like is Skull from Halo, which is "hold onto the ball and get points the longer you do". How that translates here is when a runner is on a scoring zone with the ball, instead of scoring at the end of a round they score at the beginning of each turn for that player. 

There's a ton of micro customization, most similar to Star Wars: X-Wing, though you bid for the handful of upgrades and ringers (super duper players with a special ability) with a meager amount of money. You'll also use that cash for getting rid of cheating cards to avoid penalty points, so money is TIGHT.

Everything plays out in an hour or less; even our very first game only took about 60 minutes. It's another win for Eric Lang, and it's a complete system, so it's going to be a joy to explore.

At first glance this might look like Blood Bowl but upon reading the rules you'll see it's quite different, but everything that made it satisfying is present here.

Production values are very high, particularly the magnetic boards.

Fast paced fantasy sport game. Lots of interesting decisions and the cosmic encounter style card combat is great. Lots of variety and potential. I need to play a few more games to see if I can reduce the play time further. If this is fast enough to play on a lunch hour then it's a sure winner.

Love this game BUT they still haven't released the league pack so it's useless with my gaming group. Once they release the extra board and cards needed to play with a larger group I will change my rating.

RATING: 8.5
KS backer that went all in for every team and a league pack.

This game is a lighter, fast, highly confrontational sports game that combines area control with card based bluffing. The rules are deceptively simple,but don't let them fool you! Games end up tense with tactical and timing choices that can swing scoring around.

 Every team has their own play style, then when you add in "ringers" (stronger free agent players with their own special abilities) and team upgrades, there is a huge amount of variety. 

The production standards are high with nicely detailed minis, quality bits, a very sturdy board, etc.

If you want a super detailed sports game,you want blood bowl or dreadball. If you want the same feel with faster player, Kaosball is it.

An attempt to play Blood Bowl with multiple players on a smaller field with less dice rolling.  Works pretty well.  I like the card mechanisms well enough, allowing some strategic play and bluffing, which may or not fit the theme.  Strange the dirty plays count against you whether or not you actually play them as dirty plays.  The timing mechanism works pretty well.  I thought kills might be worth a bit more, but in general the ame keep moving and is aggressive.  The holding of the ball seems a bit pointless much of the time.  Was not a big fan of the bidding draft before the game began.  Took too long and ended up making some overpowered combinations.  I'd prefer just dealing some out and getting on with the game.  Also, two ringers on the field could be fun.  Anyway, decent enough.  Thuse big tweleve sided dice were a waste of space, though.

Backed on kickstarter based on designer and publisher. Started to get worried after the game in first videos didn't seem that great. Finally got my copy on 4/14 and decided to take the plunge and open it up and play. So glad I did! The game has a real depth that you wouldn't think at first, but it still plays quickly (and quite brutally). The components are really great too of course. All-in-all I kind of wish I had pledged for extra teams; going to have to wait until they show up at retail now. Update Nov 2014 - after 10 plays the game just feels so plodding, nothing much like a fast-paced sport of total domination. It's a shame because I love the minis; just wish I liked the game itself.
Update: sold summer 2016

Part of Kickstarter deal - due to ship February 2014

First play of this was a 4 player mayhem game with everyone against all. Was very chaotic with intercept tackles all the place.

Second game was more sedate as was a two player beginner game. Definitely needs the advanced rules as it was easy to manipulate refs with cash not being a bug deal.

For some reason I thought I'd enjoy this more than I did. I typically don't like these football-based games where it's more about beating each other up than getting touchdowns, but this is probably the best next to the old school Battle Ball. I just wish you had a little more freedom on your turns, and so much of the deck is filled with special cards that I wish there were more cards meant for interactions between players. Everything looked good on paper, but it was kind of boring in execution.

Way way too much luck driven because energy card system is broken.
Too unbalanced (Amazons > all).
Fighters teams are way more powerful than "playing-ball" teams.
Scoring for kills is unbalanced also.

It's just a game to have fun with friends, but there is no skill required here, that's too bad.

Played a couple of games with the copy of one of our gaming group who is into this kind of game with lots of miniatures. We haven't used most of the advanced rules yet, which may well improve the game, but the game is quite long and not really all that interesting. It doesn't really feel like a sports game because the ball is almost irrelevant - it's essentially a combat game.

This is a wonderful design that should be the reference for every sports-themed boardgame. It is a bit under supported at this point. I wish CMON supported OP as Kaosball has a lot to offer in that setting. My favorite 2015 find.

Games can take some time, but turns play quick. There are some really interesting mechanics at work here. A mixture of violent rugby and chess is an apt comparison, though admittedly bizarre. As with other CMON releases it has great looking components.

I've played it a couple of times now and really enjoy it. Probably the biggest downside is wanting to pick up the other teams that are sold separately. 

UPDATE - Ended up selling it because my wife and group didn't care for it much. I thoroughly enjoyed it and was sad to see it go :( But I think it found a good home, so there is comfort in that.

Great fun.  Don't compare this to Dreadball.  I have both and enjoy both. They both are sports games but gameplay, tone, league play, etc. are completely different.  This is much simpler and sillier. Go get both.

RATING: 5.5
Given all of the minis and cards and whatnot, I expected a more complicated game, but this was rather simple.  I think the thing that made this less interesting were the cards which felt pretty imbalanced.  It was quite possible to draw a hand which limited your ability to do much which is unfortunate.  Not bad, just not great.

Conservative 7-rating to start. Game plays pretty smoothly, and has some depth with simple rules (mostly to do with hand management and A Game of Thrones-style timing of battles/contests -- know when to sandbag). Incorporates all of the tackles, kills, cheating and ball-control in similar games. What I don't like is the kaosball sport itself is really weird, feels really game-y. Why do I score for standing in weird spots at the end of a period? It's weirder than Quidditch, and makes no sense whatsover! (aside from for game balance) It's not King of the Hill either when there are multiple hills.

More ball stuff, or a traditional football style game, would be cool.

Eric Lang, Blood Bowl, dials and MAGNETS were enough to sign me up for my first blind Kickstarter.

Seems a little dry without the Upgrades and Ringers (star players), especially since there was a conscious choice to make team abilities simple, so incorporate them quickly. My favored method right now when demoing the game is to start the game without them, then introduce them at halftime.

RATING: 6
* Doesn't feel much like football/bloodbowl, instead like some weird king of the hill thing

* Disagree with designer recommendation to leave out the team customization options on a first game; the game got significantly better with them included, and the Ringers especially aren't really complicated. At very least should start with less money if you're gonna leave the customize stuff out, because otherwise the money may as well be infinite

* Combat system isn't bad. Can push your luck that your opponent doesn't have the card they need, and you have to gauge how important winning a particular contest is to them.

* The sprinters seem boring, options on turn are already rather limited with other figures

Fantasy sports game like a lighter Blood Bowl or Dreadball: play a tactics card or activate a player (run/tackle/attack), then score points each turn if you possess the ball on a scoring mound, at the end of a period for each player standing on a scoring mound, or at the end of the game for most kills. Lots of variety in terms of team special powers and "ringer" players purchased in a pre-game draft.

Ringers and team abilities are so powerful that games will be won or lost on the draft auctions.

I was initially interested in this game because "contests" (attacks/tackles/stealing the ball) are resolved through cardplay vaguely reminiscent of Dungeon Twister. Each team has a base value (0-2), to which players add a card (1-5, or a special 0 card which beats 4-5). The trick is that the second time you play a card of a given number, it is "dead" and automatically loses to any "live" card played an an opponent. In theory, this adds some nice elements of bluffing and hand-management.

The problem is that it just doesn't quite work. Card luck is problematic, particularly because there is no way to cycle cards. The requirement to play energy cards (and low variety of same) means that you will frequently be burning useful cards for contents you can't win or don't care about winning because you can't choose simply to not participate. The result is unsatisfying cardplay coupled to an unsatisfying rhythm -- for all that turns go quickly, the one-action-per-turn restriction makes it frustratingly difficult to do anything. You can't run and grab the ball, pass it off and then kick an opponent in the face; you can grab the ball and stop, hoping not to be killed in the next turn, [i]then[/i] (if you survive) move again.

Quite a disappointment.

You don't have to be a sports fan to like this! Any issues you may have with the theme fade away once you realise just how good the game is.

The contest system is what really makes the game. SO good infact, Eric Lang used this again in Blood Rage.

This game should seriously get more attention.

An alright game punctuated with a handful of epic/exciting moments. Unfortunately, it's much too grandiose/overproduced for what it ultimately is. At the end of the day, Kaosball just demanded too much shelf space and monetary investment to justify keeping itself around.

I might enjoy this more with more plays but my one (4P)game was horrible - my team were entirely blocked by the end of turn one, so had no tactical options to make.  And we had terrible cards and unlucky dice and lost almost every tackle and fight in the game, which ended in the first turn of period 3.  Not a good introduction.

Played two times now, and I am warming up to it. Kaosball is, well, pretty chaotic (who would have guessed). The game mainly revolves around clever cardplay and hand management. It is easy to get screwed by the cards you draw, even though there is plenty opportunity to bluff your way out of it. Guessing, double-guessing and bluffing is the order of the day here, as well as keeping the best cards behind for future key moments. As such, I certainly cannot recommend this game to the serious euro gamer, or even a serious BloodBowl player. But every game is pretty dramatic and tells a, sometimes hilarious, story. The minis are fantastic and the game components are incredibly polished. The rulebook is good too, even if there are a lot of little rules that are easy to forget. All in all an odd game, but I like it.

RATING: 1
I had one play of the basic game of this and the experience was awful. It's a long distant spinoff of Blood Bowl, smashing your way through fantasy football. I realise now that mentioning the two in the same sentence is just an insult to Blood Bowl. This game is garbage.

It was so incredibly clear that the factions were imbalanced that it turned into a game where people were ganging up on the Amazons.

The Amazons are ridiculous with their ability to attack along diagonals while every other team can only attack orthogonally. Why does this matter? Because your character stops whenever you're even walking past an Amazon character, and with their incredibly high attack skill, the chances of your character surviving are pitiful. So they gum up the ground, and when you try to take them on you end up losing. Does this sound remotely fair or balanced? Did people even playtest this game at all? 

Stuff like this make me angry. This is nothing but a giant shelf piece. It looks amazing on the shelf, but as soon as you actually try it, you're left with that empty feeling that you've wasted not only your time but your money.

CMON are simply a miniatures company, nothing more, nothing less.

Kaosball is all that and a bag of chips!

The miniatures are gorgeous, the gameplay is very engaging and tense due to the bluffing and double-bluffing of the card play. I thought I'd miss dice, but the cards work much better.

Even Exhibition Games are a ton of fun, and is where I see Kaosball passing Blood Bowl in my estimation. Sadly in Blood Bowl one-off games aren't much fun, as the game revolves around league play and improving your team, and without this component Blood Bowl loses a lot.

Sure, Exhibitiona Games are much improved by drafting Team Improvements, and Ringers, but I recommend that new players first play a learning game without those two elements. However, that said, obviously Kaosball Leagues is where it's at!

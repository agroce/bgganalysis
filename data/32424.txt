RATING: 5.5
An interesting system with loans and shares in the bank of England, some games its used much more than others which feels right, I like the boundary costs for trains and K-K bonuses for getting your tokens in the right places.

RATING: 9
Relatively short 18xx with tight capital.  Loans replace emergency money raising, but they are sufficiently punishing that this does not make the game easier.  Laser-focus on the question "Where are my permanent trains coming from?".  If you can't answer this question, you may not get to keep all of your companies.

+ Great game that adds some brilliant twists to the 18xx genre. We played it in 5 hours which is within the reasonable playtime for me. Its method for auctioning the private companies is by far my favourite.
- Expensive, but that's what happens when you buy an almost homemade game.

Initial impression (2-player 2-handed game):

This will likely raise up to a 9 or so.  I need to see how dynamic the loans can be, and how things change when companies start going into receivership.

A bit overwrought (you can play a few matches and see a few elements of the design not come into play at all) but still pretty fun. The map is interesting, even if (or perhaps because of this) it does develop pretty much on the coast.

After a cruel 3p match, I raised the rating by 0.5. I finally got my match were all players placed their stations. Ouch.

I really enjoy this title, but its probably not in the top tier of 18xx games. Its nice in that there are not too many chromey rules to make the game cumbersome, but it retains a unique feel. Double O does a magnificent job with production quality.

I look forward to playing again soon.

1848: Australia takes most of the things I like about 18Mex and ratchets it up a level. At its basic level, it is another 1830 with a twist style game, with a lot of particular flavor bits that distinguish it from others of its ilk. What stands out the most, however is the loan/nationalization system that is so brutally punishing that it shapes everything in the game around it. This loan system has the following characteristics:
1)	You are unable to get any money into the company’s treasury after it starts unless you withhold or take a loan
2)	If you take a loan it pushes your company’s stock value back; this has a significant effect as stock values climb at a very accelerated rate in 1848.
3)	If your company is pushed all the way to the edge, it is nationalized reducing the maximum number of shares that everyone gets, with the owner losing more. Everyone who is not an owner of the company gets a full share payout. The owner gets nothing.
4)	You can buy shares in the “government” which increase in value as more companies take loans and get nationalized.
Now, there is no requirement for companies to get nationalized. You can get through a game without it happening. But the mere threat of it has interesting implications on the game.

RATING: 8
Potentially interesting 18XX, even though it looks meaner than it actually is. The rules for loans and what happens when you take one along with the receivership rules sound interesting, but in my one play never really took.
Need to play more and rating might go up.

UPDATE: oh my g*d can this game be mean. played a second time with a different group and the interaction was quite different.

This game has lots of new and interesting things to think about, and it seems to present important decisions.  On the other hand, there's a lot of work in playing it that is not exactly the kind of work I'm looking for in an 18XX game.  I've played only once and don't feel much of a desire to play again.

RATING: 8
I'd describe this as 18Chicken - it is a massive game of Chicken from Start to finish.  Do you want to pay more now for that private, or do you think you can nudge it down just a little bit further and hope nobody else picks it up?  As the game goes along, you have a similar dilemna - should you buy the 4?  How long will the 4s last?  Will your opponent buy the 4? You've just counted $400 on a run - which will be more than enough to save your company, but with a stock round coming up, wouldn't it be better to pay out and help your position?  

It's a very tight, very well done game, and turns the 18xx maxim of "if in doubt, buy a train" on its head- every $ in your company is precious, and you simply can't afford to waste money.  Very solid 18xx.

There's nothing about an 18xx game that provides me any form of enjoyment, and so the prospect of spending another three hours(at minimum) per session at least half a dozen more times just to progress past the conscious incompetence stage is unappealing. The strategies and tactics of this genre will forever remain opaque to me.

RATING: 8
This is one of my favorite 18xx, because it is elegant and not so bloated as many other titles. It has some interesting extra rules over 1830, especially with the Bank of England and loans.  It is nicely balanced and not too crazy long of a game.

RATING: 8
One of the best 18xx variants I’ve played. It hits a good balance between limited increase of complexity and added depth. The unique McGuffin is the Bank of England (BoE) whose shares can be bought in the stock round as an alternative to the company shares. In the operating rounds, companies can take out loans from the BoE, increasing its share price. Instead of forced capitalization to buy trains, the BoE jumps in. Loans don’t cost interest but lower the share price of the companies, possibly driving them into receivership.

Floating a company with the aim to lead it into receivership is a valid strategy. The minor companies are issued via a dutch auction and have interesting characteristics. The game can already be lost in this auction. Further small details such as the differing track width mitigated by E-trains and the Ghan give 1848 a unique flavor.

First game took us 6 hours (3 players). I intended to focus on companies' value at the end of the. It turned ut, that payouts in this specific game are really huge. It might be a good idea to withhold money 2-3 times to buy 8 or D train.

A very nice 18xx game with a good twists (Bank of England, 2+/3+/etc trains and 2E trains). Perhaps more special rules than in your average 18xx game but all of them felt refreshing rather than overthought.

RATING: 10
Very beautiful game: it is very playable and maybe a bit less aggressive than other games of the 18xx series.

There are a lot of innovative things compared to other 18xxs, the most significant being the Bank of England: between other things companies go in receivership instead of bankrupting, making the punishment less hard for the director of the company.

As other games of the series it offers a lot of choices, so significantly more and deeper than the average Euro game that for me it is a real pleasure to play, there are so many ways to be creative.

The only problem is the length: it is a middle length 18xx game, that means still being around 5 hours, more in the first games. If it were not for this I would rate the game at "11" :)

Very recommended if you like deep gamer's games and you are not frightened by the length and by the fact that you will need all your neurons to win this :)

One of the best of medium length 18xx games. Has interesting track development with gauge changes and double cities, nice stock market activity and several twists to spice up the gameplay - mainly Bank of England that has it´s own shares, and it´s share price and dividends depend on how many loans are taken and how many bankrupt companies are taken over by the bank.

Very interesting 18xx. Quite fast to play, yet has deep decisions. Financing forced train purchases with loans instead of president cash makes this one very different from most other 18xx games.

Stay away if you're six players. Like 1830 at six, often, they will be players who won't be running corporations, or will have to wait several operating turns until they could start running their corporations. I didn't have a problem with that in 1830 because 1830 plays fast -- but 1848 plays in about the same time. Simply put, the chrome added to 1848 makes the game drag; these changes make corporation and capital (mis)management less flexible and thus less interesting:

* Corporations may take out loans but they don't have pay interest. Instead the corporation's share value drops. If a corporation's share value drops below a certain point, it goes into "receivership" -- the corporation dissolves, but the president is not liable for its debts. Because of this lack of liability, there is far less tension and suspense of a player going bankrupt because of a badly managed corporation.

* Players can buy shares in The Bank of England. The more loans corporations take out, the more The Bank of England's stocks are worth. Sounds like a good idea -- you're speculating on the misfortune of others. However, it's no fun owning shares in an entity you can't do things with. One of the least exciting strategies in 18xx is to play the stock market: Owning valuable shares but not controlling a corporation. This is not fun because you get to do far less in the game. 

* The map itself is uninteresting. All the cities line the shore of Australia. There are less opportunities for clever re-routing. I did like the ability to build two yellow tiles per OR, but that's just to compensate for the large spans of empty space.

* I believe 18xx games should end shortly after corporations manage to get their permanent trains because at this point, the game becomes route optimization, which I don't find interesting. This end game phase lasted about 20-30 minutes.

The upside:
-Brings new ingredients to the 18xx recipe, providing necessary variability from other titles.
-I dig the 'K' bonus on this game, like the E-W bonus on 18Neb, which is a way of rewarding companies who work on the routes that would make the most sense for the setting.
-It handles the privates auction in the best way I know from any other 18xx. 

The downside:
-I hear it's a little expensive, and the components are subpar to what you can do yourself.
-I don't like the idea that if you get rid of X shares, the share price doesn't go down by X spaces, but just one.

Australia:
Ok to poor 18xx game.  There are minor rules variations to the game that add to the play time without adding to the game.  For example: instead of using the typical watershed auction, the designer used the chart reduction technique.  Not all that different, but resolving the auction takes three to four times longer than the watershed.  Also, British Empire bonds - Why? I know it may be thematic, but money invested in the bonds is without risk. Overall, not a huge fan of this iteration. 1830 is still my fav.  

EDIT: I played with six players twice, apparently this game is for 4-5 players max.

The privates "auction" at the beginning is an interesting diversion.  Once we learned how *not* to take loans, the Bank of England has become a lot less powerful and has not been a real factor in the game.

Rather small map where token placement is usually vicious. Some privates properties were a bit useless. I've played only once with five and assume it would be better with four. In general a really good 18xx which can be played in 4-4.5h.

Loved the game. I played it with 3 players and right now after doing it I understand better all the positions on board and all the different little different companies. First mistakes when playing a new 18xx have to do with not understanding the map and which companies can do which runs. After the first play I'm now more ready to get into that board again and try to not make all those mistakes I did. Also, the market is interesting enough although there aren't many position changes - at least we didn't have lots of that.
I liked the England Bank rule although I got screwed by it a lot. In fact I took 2 companies to the drain and lost badly for it. But the bank is there to help! Or not!
The board runs mostly in the coast but that's Australia right?
Great game!

In my one playing the bank of England wasn't much of a threat, but more of a deterrent from going without a train.  Withholding for 200+ is better than loosing 2 spots for $100, except you can payout and still get the 100, sort of like 1/2 withholding. 2010/01/31

Based on 4p game.  Can only see myself liking this more.

Update after my 4th play: Stock manipulation is more subdued than some of my other favorites, but that doesn't bother me here. There are ample opportunities to attack the other players, and while stock price manipulation is still a viable tactic it requires a little more commitment from the seller. Even playing in a group that's a little on the slow side it comes in at roughly 5hrs. Viability at 3p and short(ish) time requirement means this one should continue to see regular play.

RATING: 7
The Bank of England is an interesting twist and offers an alternative strategic consideration that isn't present in other 18xx. The map develops into a cluttered token fest- token placement can definitely make or break a company's network. On the whole an intriguing 18xx, my only quibble being the stock market does little to distinguish itself.

Quick 18xx, with bank that gives out loans and swallows bankrupt companies.

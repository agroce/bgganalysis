I like the theme and it wasn't that hard to play.

Rulesbook could have been better organized.  Highly recommend to watch the rules videos from YouTube in addition to reading the rulesbook before playing.  Map gets cluttered fast because so much can be placed on a tile.

Rules are a bit clunky, but its tremendously scary if you get yourself into the mood.

First time I played, my friends jumped into the elevator, then locked the door behind them one turn before lockdown, leaving me with 2 guards and a clone ready to attack me with literally one dice roll between me and total failure. Semi-cooperative = treacherous!

Played a game at Lock & Load. Had a lot of fun even though I was killed at the end by two aliens. Another player darted thru the room I was in getting beat on by the aliens to sweet victory and freedom. It was pretty funny all in all. The game play feels similar to "Betrayal at House on the Hill" except without the clunkiness that Betrayal had sometimes. If you loved betrayal it will be easy to like this. For those people who always try to be a team player no matter what, prepare to die alot in this game.

Great game, good re-playability. Lots of fun to be had progressing through a couple of scenarios, you can spend the night playing the game or just play one scenario. 

Note on length:

Official game length can be confusing, as with the first 3-4 games you will have to regularly search through the rulebook for answers. First scenario can be very quick. Each scenario has it's exceptions and particularity that you will need to read, understand, explain and set the game properly before playing (forget the 60 min gameplay if you are playing with inexperienced players).

The good:

Game is fun and has great ambiance and re playability value, lots of pieces, awesome imagery, interesting and relevant interdependent scenarios. This game feels like one game and 3 extensions in the same box. This is definitely worth what you pay for it.

The game is immersive and really fun to play with friends. Exploring the facility and even watching others explore feels intense and dangerous. Playing with your fear level and trying to cooperate with others is interesting, but beware as soon you get closer to the end of the level (see lockdown phase) it often gets everyone for himself and you should not count on anyone doing anything but save their own butt from this point!

Given the good art, the replay value, the progressive scenarios the quantity of pieces and how the game feels like it already contains a couple extensions inside the basic game, it really shows that the people at Privateer's Press are passionate and respect their players. Just this would be enough for me to buy the game, and the future installments!

The less good:

Bad sides are (to me), lots of rules and exceptions. All different scenarios modifies the normal rules, so you always have to go back to the rulebook (it also adds variety and replay value to the game). Game setup and explaining to new players can be tedious. Rules are not badly put, but given the quantity, complexity and the fact that you often have to go back and browse through it, the rulebook would greatly benefit from being better organized and more graphical. It would really help the game to be able easily find and be able to remind rules from graphical elements, pictograms, reminder sheets included  etc.. Also, the character sheets feels a little on the cheap side, but given the quantity of quality pieces included in the game, I can't exactly complain.

So you wanna play it: (you should!)

I strongly recommend that you:
- watch the tutorial video before going through the rules (http://privateerpress.com/videos/level-7-escape-video-tutorial)
- print a second rulebook (from privateer press website: http://files.privateerpress.com/level7/docs/LEVEL_7_%5BESCAPE%5D_rules.pdf) before playing
- make other players watch the tutorial before playing (maybe while you setup the game)
- read the rules again after the first 2 plays
- and why not get your own character sheet printed! (http://level7film.com/character)

Haven't stopped playing this since the day I bought it. Game pieces are top-notch and gameplay mechanics are strategic. There is always great tension during each game. I love the threat/fear/vitality system, it makes the gameplay much more of a survival type of game than a defeat every enemy you encounter. Co-op is needed in order to finish many of the levels and the game scales well according to the # of players. Thumbs up!

Really good Dungeoncrawl with an interesting theme and some great mechanics. It´s fantastic how the aliens and the soldiers can interact, and how the players can try to manipulate this. Tiles could be a little bigger, the events definitely more interesting and miniatures would help a lot. I´m not on this glorifying minis trip as many people are today, but in this game, where the tiles are small and the art is so dark, the standees are often hard to distinguish...especially the heroes. Even chits could have worked better here.

Only one play - second scenario. The three stance cards and all of the extra abilities give the human player(s) a load of options to consider which is great for customising the squad but difficult to remember in practice. We kept remembering that we could have thrown an extra dice or two a bit too late. I like the theme and the five different commandos but once the combat proper starts the game slows down to a snail's pace which isn't very exciting and there aren't really any difficult decisions to make.

Mediocre game with a lot of luck involved and the semi-cooperate part of the game is rather non-cooperative.
Pieces could have been vastly improved and a lot of the components seems flimsy.
Poorly written rules and without a index very hard to find things in the rulebook.
For the price charged miniatures should have been included.
Also seems quite a flat game with little depth and the theme is lacking by poor design of card graphics and very little or no flavor text on the cards.
More difference among equipment and give monsters and chracters more individuality.
Some rules are also lacking in giving the impression that this is more than a stab at making a boardgame.
Underneath all this criticism I can appreciate that there is a game at the core but it is not developed enough to make it as great as it could have been.

Very cool horror-scifi theme. The gameplay is fluid and fun. I like the semi-cooperative nature of the game and the way combat is resolved.

The first play of it was actually pretty fun, as it was a bit of a romp.  But there are some really strange design decisions that soured me on it pretty quickly.  The main one I can remember now is that once the escape route is found, you have a highly limited set of turns before you have to get to it, no matter where you are.  Even if you're playing carefully and staying together, it can be impossible to escape with only one turn.  But the real problem is the game just takes way too long for what it is, once you get past the opening scenario.

Privateer Press are known for their mini's so it is a little strange that there are no mini's in this box at all.

The player token you are provided with a very dark in art work (as is thematic) however they are a little difficult to tell apart which is further compounded by the token showing a full art of the character and the character card showing a close up of the face of the character.

Tiles are again suitably dark and thematic however adding symbols to the tiles to define where the doors and vent openings whilst it might have affected the aesthetic value of the game would have made it easier to play.

The first scenario is a little bland and it is disappointing that both the guards and the clones have exactly the same statistics however I have high hopes for the further levels.

Card stock is not great but this game is oozing with theme and so I am looking forward to playing again in the future.

RATING: 5
Does a decent job of attempting a survival horror scenario, even if the videos are a little melodramatic on the website. Tutorial vids are little more than a spoken word version of the rulebook with a video of some of the mechanics. Felt a bit too easy, but maybe I got lucky... five times. Only solitaired so far, though.

This is a game about escaping from 7 floors below. Each of 7 games can be played solo or cooperative (with caveats). You can also play all 7 floors and pretend it's one escape. You're talking about a long day of playing though. Teaching someone to play this will be a challenge. The rule book was really difficult to wallow through, and getting my head around this game was a bit rough around the edges. If it were easier to locate what you need in the rules without continuously fumbling through the pages to make sure you played it right, this game would have had a lot higher marks I think. I didn't like the darkened tiles because it's too hard to see what's on them. The stand up tokens were way too big as well. There was a couple times I got my avatar stand up mixed up with the other stand ups and messed up my games

The game didn't do anything for me.  The rules were confusing, coming from a wargamer that really means something.  It meant that I had to kept referring back to the rules to make sure I am playing the game correctly.  Even after a few games and having internalized the rules more, it wasn't a very immersive experience.  The theme just wasn't very strong.  The game is comparable to Gears of War in many ways and that game is heads and shoulders better than this game.  The mechanics in that game melded in with the theme better and was way less fiddly.  I am liken this game to Dungeon Quest, you flip and tile and a card and you may or may not die.  I had games where I had the -1 shield + 2 intelligence skill and boy oh boy you don't want any monsters around you to activate because if they do, you are dead meat and since the more players that are around the more monsters activate prior to your turn, you are NOT in much control of you life and death.  I played this also solitaire one character, the game is practically broken so don't even bother, playing with a single character, if you're going to solo this, control 2-4 characters.  I haven't given up yet, I will play through the rest of the scenarios before final judgement.  

Another thing I can say is the game is hard to win, you will lose quite a bit, I don't really mind losing to the system in most games, but its infuriating in this game because I felt that I was at the mercy of the die more than anything else.  I maximized my chances with card plays and adjustments to my fear track and can roll 8 die but I will still regularly fail a 5 intelligence roll.  I am not seeing the fun in that, it seems to happen way too often for my liking.  Maybe it was just bad luck in my session... we'll see.

I've play Space Hulk and in that game the puzzle element felt stronger and the games felt more tense to me.  In this game, things just felt a little too chaotic which detracted from the puzzle element and the games weren't very tight, either I got destroyed or I won easily.

Another poor decision by privateer press is the components.  The tiles are a little warp and no miniatures.  I am a wargamer and miniatures are certainly a luxury in hex and counter games but I expected more from a privateer press game!  It was a bad decision on so many levels it isn't funny.  Games in this genre often have miniatures included nowadays, the forementioned Gears of War comes to mind immediately.  The miniatures certainly added to the theme, which was much needed in this game.

looks cool.  I don't understand why everyone is upset that a miniature company puts out a game without miniatures, can't they understand that the company must want the GAME to come first? They obviously have so much planned in this Level 7 world, there is certain to be expansions to fix and flesh out this game and probably even other different games as well, and then OF COURSE miniatures to follow.

Good overall game, very thematics and fun solo or semi-coop play. It does has a couple of shortcomings.  1) - The rulebook is disorganized but there's a revised version on BGG to print. 2) -Tiles and characters a little hard to differentiate but that can easily be fixed with colored character stands. 3) - No minis, but for me that's not a minus as minis are a pain to store. However alien minis they can be found at Rebel Minis: http://www.rebelminis.com/15algru.html

RATING: 4
It's fairly easy to generate a story while you're playing this game. The various scenarios, at least initially, prevent the tactical situation from becoming stale.

There's an interesting feel to play. It's a "run away!" style game where you can fight enemies, outwit them, or give them the bum's rush (inexplicably called "bull rush" in this game). The game is perhaps a bit too mechanical to maintain that feeling of desperation through each scenario...

The main mechanic is manipulating your fear by playing Adrenaline cards, moving through vents, attacking enemies, and so on. You micro-manage your fear in order to get the proper bonuses to the dice you'll roll.

The game gets a -2 rating for really poor rules writing as well as an almost complete lack of rules organization. I'm used to FFG's paragraph salad, but this is far far worse. Some obvious things are explained to death, while other rules are hinted at or indirectly implied from the interactions of two sentences in different parts of the rules book or even hidden in 4 point font within chunks of text illustrating play.

Example #1: The adjectives "active" and "activated" are used quite frequently as qualifiers. Apparently, "active" does not mean "activated" although they are virtually synonymous in English. The meaning of "activated" is elaborately explained in great detail. The meaning of "active" is never mentioned, however the meaning of "never active" is touched upon briefly in part of a sentence on the last page.

Example #2: Guess where the set up instructions for where to place your Fear markers are located. If you guessed under the "Set Up" section you are sadly mistaken. The set up info for Fear is hidden in the section that introduces the concept of Fear. Imagine the fun of trying to locate that hidden bit of trivia during a game. I had to re-read the whole rulebook to find it again.

The rules make this simple-to-play game seem way more complex than it really is.

After several plays, we realized that the vent system could be easily gamed into an auto-teleport to leave enemies flat-footed. Simply have a designated player lure all the enemies into a cul-de-sac, then when he inevitably gets knocked out he goes to the infirmary. Sure the character loses a life, but the gain is tremendous: enemies out of position in a dead part of the map, a character free to appear where a vent is located, often in exactly the right spot needed, other characters free to act without having to worry about the enemy conga-line in a dead part of the maze, and so on...

That gaminess had me drop my rating further. 7=>4 

Finally, I could not play this game out of the box. I had to ask questions both of Privateer Press as well as here on BGG before I could play. The rules for [thing=96848][/thing] are much clearer and easier to understand by way of comparison -- and that's a much, much more complex game!

Initial Rating: 4.0 (July 2015)

When I bought the game, I knew it had a bad reputation, however the theme is so great for me (one of my favorites) I couldn’t resist to buy it along with the Lockdown expansion. The idea behind the game is fascinating and Privateer Press did a great video for the game (http://level7film.com/), however, after all of that, Level 7 [Escape] ended with a huge disappointment.

The rulebook is very bad, the rules aren’t hard but from the rulebook you will have many unanswered questions. The game components are ok and I kind of like the art (love the vents), however it is hard to find the relevant elements in each tile and the cardboard monsters are also hard to tell apart. The dice are very good.

The gameplay is regular for me. The decisions are pretty obvious, procedural and repetitive. It is pure luck if you find the exit or not and if the group decides to split, the ones that found the exit will win while he others, most likely, won’t reach the exit in time. Enemy AI is bad and makes no sense (enemies will ignore each other until certain conditions are met).

Characters are all the same, the differences come from the skill cards but this is entirely luck based (I was a genius but couldn’t fight to save my life), I’m not sure I like this. I also feel the game came with too few different enemies.

Level 7 [Escape] is supposed to be a thematic game, but I don’t feel the theme other than in reading the intro to each scenario. This is what killed the game for me. Each turn you have to draw an event card and it says “test x ability” and the like. My issue with this is that it is entirely procedural with zero theme, you are rolling for no good reason, the card doesn’t tell you “you are being attacked by guards”, “your fear increase because you glimpsed blood in the vent” etc. Each card comes with 3 events, I would have loved some flavor text in the cards.

Continuing with my theme issue, you don’t know what is happening and I hoped to get the full story after the 7 scenarios but I’m confused right now. A thematic game HAS TO make thematic sense and Level 7 [Escape] doesn’t make sense to me. For instance, at first it seemed the government is making secret experiments on humans an aliens alike in a secret facility, but then some specimens escaped so you got your window to escape as well. This explains why the aliens can attack the guards but if this is the case why when you faint you are brought to an infirmary? Who brought you there? Who is worried about your wellbeing? Is this a test? (this make no sense to me). Also in the video, it seems the aliens and the humans are allied so why then they attack each other? And if that’s the case how you escaped in the first place? I feel the story has many holes and it is a shame.
 
Bottom line Level 7 [Escape] was a crushing disappointment, managing your fear seemed like a great concept, but it was poorly implemented. The theme is only on the players´ heads and the gameplay is boring and repetitive. I will get rid of my copy and I hope the next Level 7 games are way better (I already bought them).

This game is a huge disappointment. Great theme, and decent mechanics on paper, this games fails in almost every aspect. It isn't fluid, the rule book is a train wreck, the material is cheap, lacks clarity and life. The adrenaline card mechanics can't sustain all aspects of the game. The game is also much too long for what it is. This one is a complete bust.

Still not entirely sold on this game.  It's fun for what it is, but I think I'd rather play other games of this ilk.

All the same, I'm not sure whether or not to keep this one in my collection.  I've got some time to think on it, but it's currently a flip of the coin.

Worth a try because it's not a terrible game and has some fun elements for sure.  Just not sure it's the right game for me.

Poorly written rules and oversized, clunky cardboard standees bring the score down for me. 

Game is pretty spooky, a definite plus, but in the end is just an ok gaming experience. 

Edit:  After dismissing this game as largely unplayable, my interest was reignited after watching the Box of Delights game play video. 

I found an FAQ clearing up some of the muddy rules, and some things clicked into place for me.  I tried it again and found a pretty decent game buried under the weight of the rulebook.

If you are willing to put a little effort into learning how to play, I think you might feel rewarded.

Score increased.

I guess I feel the same way about this as I feel about Betrayal At House on the Hill (and honestly, the mechanics are so similar here that it may as well be just another scenario for that game.) It's a fun story, and thankfully it didn't take very long to play, but even with multiple scenarios in the booklet, I don't see it having a lot of replayability--the core experience will be the same, and if that's the case, why not just play Betrayal?

Starting out and getting new players up to speed can be a bit of a slog for this game initially. There are a lot of rules to sift through, and which ones you'll be using changes depending on the scenario being played. However, the game itself is very good. The components are great, the theme is baked right into the game and each scenario feels like different part of a larger story, as they should. The game also plays quickly enough that it can be played multiple times in a gaming session and still remain fresh. I recommend this one for groups that like their co-op games with a dose of stab-you-in-the-back. You will have to work together, but in the end, it's every person for themselves!

Caveat being I've only played the first scenario, but it's lucky it has great theme because the game play is uninspired - it's all been done before. Move up to two spaces, explore as you can. Each turn explore a little more until someone's lucky enough to find the elevator. Everyone else has a turn or two to get there. So do you branch off and hope to get lucky, or stick with the others so everyone wins. Hmmm. There's an event card on most turns which introduces aliens and guards, which are much the same. Whack one a turn by rolling dice, discarding cards to supplements how many dice you roll, but the only reward for success is that they won't slow you down. Which is kind of dull. And that summarises the game. Surely the remaining scenarios are better, but the semi co-op nature and the average gameplay doesn't inspire enough love to care.

RATING: 8
"Clever, well-themed cooperative-ish game. There are quite a few little rules, but mostly it actually plays pretty smoothly. The rulebook isn't as bad as some say, but could definitely use improvement. It works great as a pure co-op."

What I like:
- Mechanism of how fear level affects other stats
- Simple turns: Draw, move/act, trigger event
- Skills provide modular player special abilities
- The theme is awesome, and I like the scenario system 
- The modular board and custom dice both work well

What I don't like:
- Lots of little rules to learn and remember
- Doors and vents on tiles are VERY hard to see/identify
- Player standees are hard to tell apart

I'm fine with the game having standees rather than minis, and so far the size of the tiles hasn't been a problem. Our first scenario (2p) finished in a tidy 45 minutes. We won, due to awesome card draws, which is fine with us. Second scenario took 90 minutes, and we won (on easy mode). 

I think I agree with the BGG-voted weight of 2.8.

RATING: 7
I really like playing this game. I particularly love that the game can both be competitive or co-operative. Players want to stay close in the event that one of the other players finds the exit tile, but at the same time staying close means being exposed to threat so you'd like to throw your fellow players against the clones or soldiers to give you some breathing space.

I like that the characters are just plain weak and that players have no clue what's coming. A scenario may be totally eventless and still be incredibly tense because of that. Even if eventless, it feels like an abandoned building and players never really know how long this will be.

Love the Lock-down mechanic which can turn the game into a real back-stab affair putting other players under incredible tension to save themselves.

Further plus is the possibility to influence how the enemies (military and alien) perceive each other or other players and using them as bait to get rid of soldiers or clones... I really like this.

Played this game twice.  There is a steep learning curve, but if you play slow the first few times and play the first scenario at least twice, you'll get the hang of it.  I really love this game, but it is difficult.  It is semi-coop, but that can change depending on what happens.  The one thing I wish was better was the rule book.  While large, I feel it covers some more obvious things in detail while ignoring others.

This game just doesn't do it for me.  It is an interesting concept with the fear, but the gameplay is just bad imo.  It is a competitive/cooperative game, which usually means that it is competitive from the get-go in my play group.  The crisis part of the game is brutal for the players - I guess to give the impression of the survival horror game that it is supposed to be.  Instead, it makes survival and death feel gimmicky rather than anything that you did/didn't do.

I see a lot of bad comments that don't explain why this game is bad so here goes.

It may not be good to compare but I can't help but do so. My first experience with a game of this type is Betrayal at house on the hill. Exploration of tiles and events are nearly identical. ITs pretty obvious that a lot is borrowed from the predecessor, But betrayal has way more going for it at a much fairer price.

Characters are all the same. They have the same stats, there is no flavor to them. They don't even have names.

There are 7 scenarios and a rudimentary difficulty system. I can't help but compare to Betrayal's 50 scenarios for haunts. Moreover they are random so it is much more suspenseful on what ends up being useful.

Event cards are jammed into one deck. With three events per card. This leaves no room for flavor. Some flavor texts are literally three words. These could have been 3 different decks for each type and then there would be room for description about what is actually happening besides what to roll and what is effected.

Enemies either activate far too much or too little. In scenarios where the point is escape and lockdown occurs there are no more events to cause enemies to activate and attack. They instead stand there and only serve as little more than tires on an obstacle course to go through. On the flip side during regular play you can be attacked several times before you even get a chance to act. It would not be uncommon to be attacked 6 times in a four player game before getting to do anything about it. 

With 0 threat and 0 fear enemy factions ignore each other. This is ridiculous the enemies wander past each other and only attack the players until certain conditions are met in scenario 2. Even if a guard is killed due to an event the conditions aren't met and they ignore each other.

Lockdown tokens are horrible. (In a four player game)If two people cannot escape in their second turn  then the other two players are doomed since they only have one turn to escape. The rules here seem to penalize exploring very far. With 2 default speed and with not many means to raise it without crippling yourself literally the strategy required to pull off hard mode requires meta gaming. You have to place players near where they are supposed to be to beat the lockdown limit.

There are 4 enemy types in the game and 2 of them are used a majority of the time. All scenarios revolve around these four. Perhaps this should be expected of an alien cloning facility though. Still I was disappointed. I suppose I was hoping for a variety of enemies like half life, not too many. Certainly not like Betrayal with a mountain of different tokens for each type.

The only things I can commend this game on are the fear track, skills, and the design and layout of the map tiles. Vents are brilliant, items are well done and additions to rooms instead of the actual point of the room. Reactivating events are splendid and adrenaline cards feel right, minor tweaks to these concepts but negligible.

RATING: 4.5
The artwork is really nice, but also muddy and hard to tell apart (characters and rooms mostly).
This should be a simple dungeon crawling game, but it gets so bog down by unnecessary rules for the sake of theme that it actually takes you out of the game.
The fear meter and adrenaline cards are a really good idea, but they can't support the whole game mechanically by themselves.
The different scenarios each representing a level of the building and of difficulty add theme and "replayability".  There's just no motivation to play them.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Things that I like about this game that might annoy others:
1. Cardboard figures - nice artwork, they look fine on the board.
2. Lots of dice rolling - Take the average - sometimes this game kicks you about, and other times you get really lucky.
3. No narrative card text - I don't read it anyway. I just want to know what I need to roll.
4. Rules - Yep, lots of 'if then else' in there, but I made a summary, and it isn't too hard to track.
5. Vents - I don't get the problem with these.

Ultimately though, Gears Of War is a thousand times better than this. Sold UK Games Expo 2015.

I love Privateer Press. They have a knack for creating elaborate, engrossing worlds that suck you in. The setting and theme for Level 7 do that as well. However, while the scenarios tell a good story, this game is mired in its own rules and bogged down by over complication. Privateer has always suffered from overly verbose rulebooks that make their games more difficult than necessary and Level 7 is no exception. It's hard to enjoy a game when you have to have the rulebook at hand even after multiple play sessions.

The character sheets could easily include all the relevant information, but they don't.

This game had GREAT potential: the sanity meters, the security cameras, the air ducts, the randomized tile placement that builds a new board every game... however playing through it becomes very tedious.  A lot of the game makes sense, rules wise, but it's easy to get caught in loops of poorly designed mechanisms that make the game confusing and robotic.  Not having a player act on behalf of the opposing force is awesome in theory but, like Wrath of Ashardalon, it doesn't feel as organic and doesn't function as well as it should.

I look forward to playing Omega Protocol which supposedly fixed all of the goofy shit.

My evening with Level 7 and 4 seasoned gamers was pretty painful. First off, the game does not offer enough decisions to keep me interested. At some point, I felt like the game largely played itself - almost like a computer game. Secondly, the rules are very fiddly, detailing the moves of the NPCs under 20 different circumstances. Thirdly, it involves player elimination, making it even worse for players to feign any interest in the proceedings. To top it all off, the owner of the game, who is a pretty experienced gamer, had to look at the rules almost every other turn. Painful - this is no game for me.

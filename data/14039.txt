Fast and intense filler game.

2016-02-23
Flix Mix asks for a swift hand and eye for pattern recognition. There is no strategy, just play whatever card fits the table and better yet if you can create combos from your hand. There is basically no limit how good you can become in this game since it is purely a speed challenge.

If you love to take your time to analyse things and absolutely hate speed and dexterity games, you'd better skip Flix Mix. However, if you are a player like me who moves slower than a snail in glue but still would take the challenge this game might be just the right one. Probably the first seconds will be too quick for you but once the map grows larger you have a chance as well since not even the fastest of players can keep an eye on the whole table. This gives the slower players an opportunity to participate in the game as well. Hence, I find Flix Mix an excellent game in its own category.

Speed games are not my speciality and I suppose there are better speed games than Flix Mix in the market. Plays really quickly so if you don't like the game you don't have to suffer to long.

This game is so brain dead simple, that I'm giving this game a 9 just because the designer managed to SELL this game.  He just painted some dots on cards and said "That's a Game!"  That's ballsy.  9 for you, sir designer!

RATING: 7
A speed game - a category for which I suck.  But it's at least enjoyable and easy to pick up on.  Also, it does something that most other speed games don't - it allows you to play simultaneously with everyone else.  Their being quicker doesn't always stop you from playing (only if you're fighting for the same spot).  I like that, as I'm usually a little slower, so in this game I can still do stuff.

A real time game, something which I normally hate, but I gave it a 4 because it doesn't seem to be so painfully faced paced as to leave me reeling.  Lot of little giggling would go on in the game with all the players, so it was enjoyable enought, but it's not something I'll ever bring to the table.

Simple, simple, simple... But I love the idea of everybody playing simultaneously on this enlarging board. Now, that's still the kind of game where some will be very good and other's wont be able to wrap their head around it. I'm in the second category, but I nevertheless enjoy it.

I Flix Mix har alle spillere en stak kort, der hver har seks farvede cirkler på sig. Det går ud på hurtigst muligt at skille sig af med sine kort, hvilket sker ved at man lægger dem ovenpå allerede placerede kort, så mindst to af de farvede brikker passer sammen. Et fint lille, super-stressende spil, der er fantastisk, hvis man er i humør til det.

Matching game where you have to play your cards over top other cards while matching at least 2 dots.  Everyone is playing all the time (no turns), so the person with the best pattern recognition will likely win (if they're fast enough(G))...

Perhaps I didn't get in the spirit of the game by not playing frenetically, but it seemed rather plain to me. Match up cards in corresponding patterns as quickly as possible. That's it. To its credit, it's not claiming to be much more than that.

Fun speed game when you're in a perceptive mood. This game reminds me of Nertz, but it's much more difficult to spot where you can place your card.  If you played often with a group that was really fast, I think it would be great.  As it is, the game goes kind of slowly, mainly because it's so difficult for me to spot the matches.

Who will recognize the most colour combinations? The cards show six different colours in varying arrangements. One card is revealed in the middle of the table, and all players then try to get rid of their cards as quickly as possible. To do this, the cards are played out partially on top of each other, so that at least two colours exactly overlap. It's easy to mix up red with blue or play out an incorrect colour combination. Who will keep things clear?

Very good! I like real-time action games and Flix Mix is a good choice. It's quite easy (knowing the cards well isn't necessary) and slower than some others, so there should be smaller gap between good and bad players. Still, like every other game like it, some people play it fast and some just don't.

With two players, a round can end with players holding cards they just can't play. That probably doesn't happen with more players. Of course, sometimes a deliberate mistake is a good move...

Suggest.

A real-time card placement game in which players attempt to play all of their cards into the center of the board, being sure to match up dots of a given color on a card with the card they place on. The game is extremely simple, yet it's addictive and about as easy to explain as possible. Fun, five minutes at a time.

A simple pattern recognition & speed game. Unlike most other speed games, this actually left me feeling good instead of just indifferent.

RATING: 8
Ferocious adrenalin release game for the free fifteen minutes. As in all of the games in the style, the more people there are, the more urgent and thus funny the game becomes. As is usual as well, there's hardly any time to think, so the player with the most experience has got an edge over the others (the distribution of dots in the stacks of the four colours would be another thing to consider).

...so, despite some minor doubts, Flix Mix fulfills its goal (very quickly so!).

RATING: 7
A nice game for play with children. Also fun when played with adults. I just think it is to short! A game should last longer. Second thing: I am too good at this game. I have played it several times and now noone wins against me anymore!
Update: One of my most played Adlung games!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Quite short and entertaining speed game. It really makes me nervous when everybody puts cards on table with enourmous speed while I'm still figuring out the colors...
The checking for misplaced cards is rather time-consuming and annoying but tolerable, if everyone does his/her part quickly.

And the package is so small that you can carry it in almost anywhere!

Another speed game to ditch your cards. You have to play the dots over other dots of the same color. More dots you can cover the better off you are. Plays up to 4 and it is chaos. I had a good time but I am terrible at it.

I liked this a lot more than I expected that I would.  I generally hate games requiring the ability to do speedy pattern recognition.  But this game was fun because I knew I wasn't going to win, so I just relaxed and enjoyed.  And I didn't play too poorly.

It's silly, it's fast and it's fun.  Flix Mix is a good game.

Quick, fast, fun, chaotic filler.  Probably could use a few more cards to extend the longevity of the game if it was played more frequently, and definitely could use a few more player colors to allow more players and increase the chaos.  But still, it's a blast!

[Adlung 2004 edition] {Abstract, filler; perception, real time} A simple and exciting card game. A good perception game for kids. Feel like a multiplayer Speed :) but it requires more mind processing because players have to rotate the cards and search for matches all over the table. It's more brain-teasing than Speed but it loses the adrenalin rush of Speed.

It's full of player interaction. You can see that hands are crossing each other during the play and it's becoming more difficult to attend to all places when more and more cards are laid.

It seems that all reaction and perception games have a similar problem - it's easy to have a sure winner.

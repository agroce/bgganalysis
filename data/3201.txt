Very enjoyable, asymetrical, slightly thematic game of head-to-head bluffing, double-guessing, and tactics.  

The game is 2-player only (which I generally do NOT appreciate), and you have a choice of playing white (the Fellowship) or black (Sauron's minions).  Depending on which colour/side you choice, you have different goals for winning the game.  The white player has to get Frodo into Mordor to win the game, whereas the black player either needs to catch Frodo or get three of his characters into the Shire.

Each side has several different, unique characters with both a special ability, and a strength level.  As well, each player has a hand of strength and ability cards.  White characters are generally much weaker strength-wise, but many have specific powerful abilities.  Black has much stronger characters and they have more generic albeit still powerful abilities.  As well, the black player has a stronger set of cards.  In fact, at first blush, the deck seems stacked against white (this does not actually turn out to be the case which multiple plays reveal, although playing white is more subtle/trickier to an extent).

Each turn, a player moves a character forward (black always makes the first move), and there is a limit to how many of your own character you can have in one space (limit of 2).  If you move into a space with the opposite player's character, there is an immediate conflict.  Conflict involves comparing strengths and optionally playing a card to increase the chances of victory.  Special abilities come into play at this time.  Some abilities result in an insta-kill, some cards do as well, but in general, it comes down to one players strength plus cardplay vs the other.  The loser removes that piece from the board for the rest of the game.

Really, gameplay is simple yet subtle, and most importantly fun.  My wife loves this game, and I'm surprised by how much I enjoy it.  It's very portable and cheap as well, although the original version is now hard to find with the new overproduced/oversized deluxe edition (which I own but have not played).  After a game, players immediately want to switch colours or try their colour again.  Gameplay takes about 10 minutes tops.  Recommended.

Also own the [boardgame=18833]Deluxe Edition[/boardgame].

Has a rather steep learning curve. You need several plays before you start to truly enjoy this game.

2016-02-29
You could call LotR: The Confrontation asymmetrical Chess of many surprises. On your first plays you are only learning the special abilities and rules of each character. It takes several plays to memorise them all and to learn to use your knowledge to your advantage. And this is the point where the game starts to shine. This is simply because the bluffing element of the game is virtually meaningless unless both players are familiar with the rules. What is the point of bluffing if your opponent does not understand the risk. 

But there are other elements to the game besides outguessing your opponent. There is plenty of room for deduction and making safe calls thus introducing layers of meaningfulness into the experience.

In a nutshell, the game offers great moments with experienced players. Be ready to invest some time and make sure you have a regular playing partner.

RATING: 4
I've so far played this game five times and my thoughts are these.  It's not a bad game, but is essentially a souped-up version of Stratego (and that's been done before - Admirals and a variation by Avalon Hill).  It plays well enough, but the Lord of the Rings theme feels just a bit like chrome-plating.  Underneath, the game is more complex and interesting than Stratego for sure, but really, ought this to be top 30?  I mean Stratego is nowhere near there!  And that's an original.  I reckon that anyone who has rated Stratego, can't give this more than an extra 2 points on top of that.  So, if you gave Stratego 8, then this could be a 10, I guess, but if you gave Stratego 4, and this 10, then I'd say that was logically perverse.  To my mind then, this is a classic case of an over-rated Game in the rankings. Even though I don't like this game, I'd admit that it's just about ok - but excellent - no!  

I wonder just how much of the popularity of this is down to the current fascination with all things Tolkein.  If it had a different theme would it do so well?  As it is, I think it's all fur coat and no knickers - in other words glamorous on the outside, but when you dig a bit, it has a lot of pretend (borrowed) class.  Time to slaughter a sacred cow, I think.

Great head-to-head two player game.  Lets me get my Stratego fix (without torturing my wife with an actual Stratego game), though in the details these two games are very different.  Was tempted to get the deluxe edition a while ago, but I don't think any babies will cry if I save my money.

RATING: 9
A variation of Stratego with LotR theme.  Knizia has made a small, quick, and exciting game.  Stratego is a boring game of stalling defense, but both Hera & Zeus and LotR: Confrontation have avoided this problem cleverly.  In LotR, you normally can move only forward, so players are forced to fight sooner or later.  And if you want to avoid moving your pieces into contact range, you have to advance someone in the rear, which reduces your future movement options for that piece.  The bluffing with both the character pieces and cards is classic.

Stratego with cards. Nice components. Stratego game, simplified to only a few pieces and dynamically changed to include special powers for each piece. Rounding off the unknown with a card-guessing-cum-counting gem, makes this a very interesting hybrid of Stratego.

Overall too short to enjoy and highly limited in size and gameplay. Good filler. Nothing more. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
One of my all-time favorites. The simplicity of Stratego is shattered with each piece's special power. An asymetrical game, and a true gem for Knizia's crown.

This game is pure genius! Who would have thought you could distill down all of the tension and excitement of the LotR story, not to mention the characters, into a 30 minute game. This game does it. Absolutely brilliant in it's simplicity and depth. Dark and Light play very differently and require very different strategies. I have the original version and never really wanted to update to the deluxe version. That would just add to the set-up time since you have to choose which characters to use. The original version sets up in a minute, you can teach it in 4 minutes and be done with the game in another 25 minutes. The game is one agonizing choice after another. What's not to like??

Another favorite quick two-player game. I may be slightly biased because the theme hits home with me. Despite that, it is a great game of strategic planning and tough tactical decisions. Once you know all the pieces, which only take one game to learn, you easily become immersed in the rich theme and the game seems to grow on you. Also a bonus is that it plays very quickly yet is still very satisfying.

This game has creeped down from my initial rating of "10" entirely due to balance issues.  It is very difficult for the light player to win against an opponent of equal skill.  That being said, this game is really spectacular and offers quite a lot of enjoyment.  It took many many games to fall from a "10" to a very respectable "7.5."  If I were rating this game on design, dollar cost to entertainment ratio or other bases it would score much higher- but since geek ratings are based on (essentially) desire to play a game this has to be a 7.5 for me.

"It's like Stratego," he said, which didn't really help but only led to the embarrassing revelation that I'd never *played* Stratego. (Seen the commercials, though.)

Not really for me, but I don't mind playing overmuch.

This is a game that becomes more interesting with more plays. Since each character has a unique attribute, it takes exposure to get the hang of how to use each force. Initially it appears that the dark forces of Sauron are overpowered, but the forces of good have some powerful qualities despite their apparent weaker strength.

My second favorite boardgame for two players (behind Go) due to the combination of strategy in the setup and cardplay, and tactics in the movement and cardplay.  Good match between the game rules and the theme.  Tense play, yet quick.  It's possible to get into situations that are provably losing, but those are easily recognized and you just end the game and start a new one, this time with a little more experience.

One of the best 2-player games from kosmos. A quick and fun game, but the tactics are still limited. The first two or three combats really decide your options for the rest of the game.

RATING: 8
This game does LOTR justice. You play the fellowship OR the bad guys and enough variation is included on the map (16 zones) to keep you going. Resemblance to Stratego legends but the LOTR theme makes it stand out. Very short playing time (about 20 minutes). Play it with ALL rules.

Stratego, LordOfTheRings, Solo

An excellent stratego-type game that plays relatively quickly, that even with cards manages to be a near pure abstract.  With extra cards for an effective handicapping system, a winner. 
  
I got a second copy, so that when the "Deluxe" edition rolls around, I have some placards and cards to make my own travel Deluxe edition.  I'll still get the Deluxe edition, of course.

This is a fascinating, quick playing game that is all skill. You know what options your opponant has. He know that you know that he knows that... The decisions are small in number, but they have a huge repurcussion. This is my all time favorite game.

UPDATE: This is still one of my favorites, but the bloom as somewhat come off the rose.

Following a rule that Mike P passed on to me, I need to play a game twice before I decide whether or not I like it.  My first play of this was not so enjoyable, so I am hoping that future plays will change that opinion.  I got this for a song, so no harm done if I pass it on to someone who loves it more.

Almost a 10...if Dungeon Twister didn't exist, it would fill the 10 slot. DT uses the LoTR:TC combat system but improves it with action points, rotating maze rooms, and a true depth of play with open information.

RATING: 6
Feels too scripted.  Also, you need to study the character abilities too much before jumping into the game.  Similar to Stratego and Hera & Zeus, but not as forgiving of mis-plays and unfamiliarity with the character abilities... definitely more strategic in a linear way (ex. turns Stratego into "chess-stratego"... which isn't fun for me).

When the store clerk said "like Stratego", I guess I didn't take him seriously enough. My bad.

In our quest for good husband/wife 2-player games, this was a miss for me. He is much better at these types of games than I am. I do recognize that this is a great little strategy game, but I get my butt kicked every time, and after a while, that's just no fun any more.

I am also handicapped by the theme. I have a hard time sacrificing (or killing) any of the fellowship except Boromir. How sad is that?

I have, at best, only a passing interest in the LOTR 'world' (seen the movies and that's about it) but this one works for me thematically. Some strategy, some luck, but bluffing is king.

I need to play this game more to give my final verdict, but my initial impression is very positive.

Stratego-like game, but much better. Offers a great combination of maneuver, bluffing, and timely card play. Replayability fairly decent, though the expansion will help to provide an even greater diversity of set up options. Highly thematic. The best 20 minute game I have ever played.

Really not my kind of game. It's basically Stratego with crazier special powers.  And I hate Stratego. 

I can see why some people like it, as it rewards repeated play and I imagine, like lots of abstracts, it's a very deep game. A beginner will get crushed, as critical mistakes will utterly cripple a player for the rest of the game. Unfortunately, I have no desire to play this many times, so I will never appreciate how good it might be. Sold.

RATING: 10
This surprisngly clever little game has grown on me after a few plays. The first play seemed a little obvious, but as so often happens with good Knizia games repeated play has revealed significant bits of tactical and strategic detail. It's basically stripped-down Stratego with some chrome, but the card play adds a very important degree of subtelty and an additional layer of bluff. And, it has the advantage of being extremely simple. I've upgraded my opinion to the point that I think it's on the level with Hera & Zeus, Caesar & Cleopatra, or Starship Catan in quality for me. Definitely in the top-tier of the Kosmos 2-player line. Still a bit towards the "light" end; it's not as engaging as, say, GIPF or multi-player classics like Ra or Puerto Rico, but within the "short, simple, 2-player" constraints, excellent.

Fantasy Flight set a real task for Reiner Knizia:  transform the entire 3 volume 1,000 page "Lord of the Rings" epic into a 45 minute 2-player board game experience for players age 10 and up.  It doesn't seem possible, but the doctor is in.  Reiner has the skills to pay the bills, and he proves it again with this masterful game.  LoTR: The Confrontation gets more play time than most of my games, because the rules are easy to learn and the popular theme is utilized almost to perfection.  Like most of Reiner's games, this one is addictive, and you can burn yourself out.  I've given this game an 8.5 instead of a 9 or 10, because repeated play reveals some rote strategies.  However, don't miss this precious treasure if you love boardgames, Tolkein or Reiner Knizia.

Amazingly elegant.  It plays fast and has a surprising amount of depth for such a simple game.  I love the fog of war.  I'd play this anytime and (thanks to the small footprint) anywhere. It's harder to win with the good guys, but man what a feeling. It's easy to analyze, so it becomes a matter of bluffing and positioning. Mistakes can be brutal though, so be careful. My one gripe is that my old version doesn't have the clearest rules when it comes to interactions; I usually just err towards the theme if I'm unsure. Best two-player Euro ever!

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3.7
This game is bad.  This is what happens when you give Knizia an idea, and an apparent 27 minute deadline.  This is worse than stratego.  At least Stratego has...what word am I looking for here...oh yeah, STRATEGY.  It doesn't have a paper, rock, scissors element, and there are enough pieces in Stratego to make interesting moves with your turn.  In this game, once you find out information, it can be too late to use it effectively.  The rules just lack anything to bring the game back to the land of the compelling.  What do you mean you can't move backwards or sideways?  What the @#$^%#^$ is the point of that?  

Lord of the Rings sucks.  Those movies were the most overproduced pieces of terribly acted and worthlessly directed crap I have ever seen.  They were disappointing to anyone who can call themselves a lover of film.  This game also sucks, keeping alive the spirit of the films.  This should be disappointing to anyone who can call themselves a lover of games.  If you love this game, you have really sunk low enough to willingly participate as the dog that rummages through Peter Jackson's table scraps.  Alright, I am finished.

This game has a lot going against it. I rarely get to play gamery two-player games and I dislike Lord of the Rings and fantasy themes in general, so for me to give this a 9 shows how much I think of this game.

Very quick with interesting special abilities which make this quite thematic. This is one of the best LotR games but I find the board artwork very plain and uninspiring.

RATING: 9
Better and faster than I thought. Way more balanced and subtle than I thought at first as well. It packs a lot into so little. Really looking forward to more plays of this.

I dare say this is BRILLIANT in every regard for its tight theme and heartfelt execution of the source narrative. Captures the flavor, mimics the narrative, plays off my connection to the story---all in only 20 minutes! You can relive and change the whole narrative each time you play.

Knizia is so much better with theme then people give him credit. Seriously, the man is a rock star and the sheer number of truly exceptional and diverse games that he has designed astounds me. Someone with half his great designs would be a legend.

Rating after two plays.  Enjoyed OK, but didn't love.  Seems to appeal more to fans of "variable player powers" games.  Maybe getting to know the player powers makes this especially replayable, in which case my rating would have to go up.

Just lowered my rating from 8 to 7.  Don't get me wrong, this is a good game, but as I get more games, and play them, I'm finding that this one just isn't grabbing me like it used to.  I think it really demands repeat play with the same players for the bluffing aspects to shine, which is necessary for the game's tension.

Received via a math trade for Shogun: Tenno's Court.

Rated 7 after one play, but this could go up with familiarity. Tough to rate this one after a single play, as the meat of the game rests in familiarity with the various characters. However, it plays quick, it has some depth, and I hope we play this some more.

Update: 2nd play, and notching this up to an 8. This is a clever game where good use of character powers, card powers, and smart movement on the board all matter. There's a lot of game in this little package.

This is one of the better two player Kosmos games.  However, you have to have a fairly good understanding of all the pieces (one both sides) in order to begin seeing the strategies involved.  I find there is a lot of bluffing involved in this game, but when it works out in your favor it's a lot of fun!  Many games I've played have been very close and down to the wire.  Important to find someone of an appreciable skill level, however.

There isn't a lot to this game as it is mostly about guessing what your opponent has / will play, there tends to be 50/50 odds if you guess correctly you win, if you don't your opponent does. I printed out the expansion that now comes standard but I have yet to play it.

This is one of my favorite 2-player games.  Its very tense and the fine balance is majestic.  What a masterpiece of game design.  To call it a "Stratego Variant" doesn't capture the thrill of the game and the way the theme is really reinforced by your decisions. 

I can't put my finger on it exactly, but I prefer this version to the Deluxe game. Weird, I know.

RATING: 8
Fun and fast-paced little two player game from Kosmos. Both sides are very evenly balanced and require different playstyles. I think the game reaches its peak when both players are intimately familar with each other's style, and bluff / counter-bluff / counter-counter-bluff plays become possible.

I don't understand why people find the Stratego comparisons offensive, to me, that's exactly what this game is capturing in a more nuanced, enjoyably themed way. As in Stratego each side has a hidden array of forces with counter-measures to particular other pieces. This is what I was alluding to up above. Really, to me this game requires at least 5-10 plays with the same person before its real enjoyment can start to come out.

This is not my favourite 2 player game because of its inherent lightness and lack of true depth, but its small, portable nature and fast play both are check marks in the plus column, as is the theme. I don't play this nearly as much as I'd like for whatever reason, but it's a great little title.

Aside: I've not played the Deluxe Edition, but everything I've seen of it makes me think I would like it less than this. The box is big, and the piece count is higher. More variety in the pieces, to me, would not benefit this game, as it already is nicely balanced and to me, as noted above, depends on player familiarity with all of the pieces. Adding another set of pieces just increases the amount of time it would take to get to the interesting play when both players are experienced.

There is something to be said about becoming too abstract.  I mean, you can't really boil the entire Lord of the Rings down 12 areas and 12 turns and still keep the feel alive.  Still, the game play is very solid.  This is what hidden information should be, a great growth from Stratego.  A very good game overall - best played with each player playing both sides at a sitting.

I'm still learning the game but I've fallen in love!  RK has done an excellent job incorporating the theme into the game (e.g. Good's only victory condition is getting Frodo to Mordor, Gandalf returning once after death, etc.).  The tactical play has been fun as well as guessing whether your opponent will play a text card or a number card.  On top of this, artwork by John Howe!

Updated after the release of the Deluxe Edition.   Perfectly designed two-player Stratego variant.  Probably the best two-player game I own, it's just amazing to play with another experienced player.  I bought this thinking it would be just a little filler that might get played a couple of times but my game partner and I played it literally 17 times the night I bought it.  The Deluxe edition is a must-have for experienced players if only because it introduces some interesting variations without altering the gameplay.  The new and variant characters change the game in subtle ways and mixing them up makes for some nice surprises, particularly if you've played the original game into the ground.  The art and production are better overall- an absolute classic in every sense of the word.

After 4 playings its dark side 3 light side 1. I'm sure this will even out as time goes by. Not that this is a bad thing in the first place. In fact I very much enjoy the tension in playing the light side. It's a nice change of pace to play a game with non symetrical starts. As for the rest of the game its also very good. Easy to learn quick to play but still with lots of tactics and tension.

After 3 plays (right in a row!)  Kind of like stratego, but more soldier variety, and you have cards to help you out.  It's very difficult to win with the good side, out of the three games we played, good never won.  The hardest thing to do is protect Frodo.  We're convinced there's a trick to playing the good side, and will hopefully discover it after a few more plays.  I found the game enjoyable enough to keep playing even with this imbalance.  UPDATE: have played this more, and we were each able to win with the good side.  Still a fun game!

RATING: 8
This has become my favorite 2 player non-wargame.  It only takes a minute to setup and doesn't take long to play at all.  The strategy is deeper than you would think by just observing the game a couple times.  When you add that to the fact that the rules are so simple anybody can jump in and start playing in no time, it makes a great game.  Both players are concentrating on their overall strategy rather than worrying about what legal moves they can make and how they can exploit the rules to their benefit.

This game has the edge-of-your-seat thing going for it.  Every move you make has you thinking twice, and revealing your cards is always an exciting experience.  When the game is over you already want to setup and play another.

RATING: 7
This game is impressive.  It won't go down in annals of history as the best game ever, but for a short, light to medium strategy game, it is hard to beat.  For how simple and concise it is, it is amazing how much strategy is in this little game.  If you liked Stratego as a kid, this game may appeal to you.  I reccomend this to anyone who likes the  books and movies.  Also, anyone who wants a good, short, strategic game, this is for you.

For me, its additional characters from deluxe edition are obsolete; even without them that game is very close to a masterpiece.

I got this game a long time ago when I was still in the habit of blindly buying whatever people thought of as 'good'. (I still do, sometimes, but I take into account what I like as well.) Learning this game was not easy, as you need to remember all specific character traits. The manual is a constant companion during that time. At first you tend to believe that the white pieces are underpowered, but after a few games that feeling subsides and things can become quite tense, with the game won or lost on a single move. But after more games of this super Stratego there simply is no variety to keep you coming back. It starts to hinge on lots of 'what if' questions which increase the luck factor to a considerable degree. I therefore completely fail to understand why people got so excited over the re-edition with the huge pieces. In the end, my girlfriend refused to play this anymore, so I sold it off.

Production: Colorful art, sturdy pieces, and concise text.  The pawn frames slightly obscure the graphics.

Play: I am completely inept at this game.  It is very simple, but with each piece having a different power, there is room for strategy (for my opponent) or chaos (for me).  Whichever side I play I feel fearful and set upon throughout. (3+0+2) (8 plays)

Pretty cool game. Ive always loved the idea of a battle where both sides dont start out with identical armies/powers, but its still fairly even. This game seems to have done that. Seems to have a number of rules issues ( per all the FAQs/questions listed here), but once you read those and get those settled, its good stuff. For a 2 player game for $20, its a great deal.

This would be a great game if not for the theme. I just get the characters mixed up. I know that's a dumb thing to say. After all, you're probably interested because of the theme and if so, you should get it. You'll know who Shelak is and all those other creepy guys who are trying to stop the fearless halflings. I just can't keep up. The game is quick with a little stratego mixed with some corner checkers. Only two players, though.

Clever and quick two-player game.  It has the bluffing of Stratego with a claustrophobic gameboard and only a few pieces and cards.  This amounts to a very tense and kinetic battle.

This game is essentially Stratego reborn, with the added complication of &quot;sudden death&quot; if Frodo happens to kick the bucket.  It is harder than Stratego (since Frodo has to move to Mordor and doesn&#039;t sit stationary under guard as the Stratego flag does).  The graphics are also nicer and I love Lord of the Rings, so it gets some points for theme.  But like Stratego it is best for an occassional play.

Very fun game, though you have to play it a few times before it gets fun. The first few times you play it, you don't know all the characters on the board yet and you can't get into all the tactics. But after that, it's a lot of fun.

Good development on old Stratego framework.
Special abilities drip with theme, while combat card turn an otherwise boring game in an interesting bluffing (and no longer only memory taxing) game.

Just got it on Friday. Played the other night and lost! Played my 9 year old daughter in a friendly match to lean the game,,,won but we both learned a lot. Man some heart rendering decisions to be made in this game. Every turn. It's so simle and yet it's depth is complex. Lost this afternoon. My Dark guys were too far forward and couldn't retreat...really got to think this one thru. Brilliant! though!

RATING: 9
There are two kinds of Confrontation detractors; those that say the Dark player always wins and those that say the Light player always wins.  I say they're both right.  This game is a real treat to play with an experienced partner and will provide hours of wonderful frustration.  Repeated play really pays off here, which could move your rating up or down a notch depending on taste - for me it drops half a point for that (not easy finding someone willing to invest the time for it) and it loses half a point for those sometimes-too-frequent fifty-fifty guesses on card play.   Lunch Hour Game of the Week(s) 05/08 - 05-18.

It's unbelievable how much tension can be created with just a few tokens and rather simple rules. The more I play it, the more I realise: Lord of the Rings: The Confrontation is a masterpiece!

[2012-10-09 Rating: n.a. -> 8.5]
I had my eye on Lord of the Rings: The Confrontation (LotR:TC) long before I finally gave in and bought it. Guess what: Didn't regret it. The core of the game is Stratego, but who would have thought what a few added cards and special abilities could do to a rather dull game. LotR:TC plays and feels like a condensed CCG. You have the potential for cool combos and strategic play but not the need to learn a hundred cards. A great game.

My 10-year old son is still warming up to it, which is odd considering he's the biggest LotR fan among us . . . . Actually, we named our daughter "Elenya" after the word "Starday" (Monday) in the ancient Elvish dialect of Quenya, so I guess that qualifies my wife and I as LotR fans, too.

Rules Modifications: When I play with my sons, I usually play Light, without the Variant Cards, but allow them to use the Variant Cards as Dark.

I love this game!  Lots of tension and back and forth.  The first few plays feel random, but after you and the other player know it well, this can be very tactical.  It fits the theme well and plays quick.  Excellent 2 player game!

Wow.  Had this in my closet for ages without really looking at it.  Saw on a LotR GeekList that it was one of the best so we tried it.  Powerfully cool.  I can't see it lasting more than maybe 10 plays, but for now, I am itching to try it again.  And Wiki won't get caught out of position next time.

Ok 2 player game.  Plays quick and is easy to learn.  A filler game that I don't mind playing.  I should probably rate it the same as Stratego (5) though...but I like the theme a bit more.

RATING: 10
Another Knizia/Lord of the Rings game, and happily it is a goodie.  Players play a stratego variant, light vs dark, where each sides nine pieces have special rule breaking abilities (eg. Merry automatically defeats the Witch King).  Light wins if they get Frodo to Mordor, dark wins if they capture Frodo or conquer The Shire.  Simple and elegant, full of bluff and deduction, just the right whiff of chrome (Sam fights like a lion when with Frodo, etc).  A marvellous light two player game.

I enjoy the occasional cooperational game.  And I like that this one does NOT use kid gloves, it is dang hard.  I'd always choose for a game to be too hard than too easy.  It does feel though like certain tile draws just mean you can not win regardless of tactical choice, so like 25% of the time you are guaranteed to lose before you've even started the game.

At first, I thought with a shrug: "[thing=1917][/thing] with a theme"
Yeah, but with teeth, deep theme & near addictive replayability.  The way each character piece has it's own powers & the way battles are resolved set this one apart - a VERY great distance.  In my opinion, this is one of the best two player war games I've ever played.  Set up takes less than a minute, and the games typically finish under 30 minutes.  High replayability!  I got totally immersed in the LotR theme, and left wanting more.  A must for any collection.

It is basically, an advanced [gameid=1917] version with a Lord of the Rings theme. But I think it really grabs the theme, and adds enough twists to make the game very interesting.  A great two-player combat game, and if you like the Lord of the Rings, it is a must have.

I think this game is great - there is plenty to think about and both sides have a chance of winning. It feels like LOTR too with character properties matched perfectly with the book. Don't judge this on a couple of plays. Some have suggested the dark side is too strong - well I have had some success with white and lost as black - this makes me think it is more even that it at first appears.

With the help of my article I wrote on about Lord of the Rings - The Confrontation, I got a better understanding for some pieces in the game and what to do with them.

I find Lord of the Rings - The Confrontation to be a very interesting game. Way better than the original Stratego. 

Lord of the Rings - The Confrontation is currently my favorite 2 player game.

*UPDATE* Warhammer Invasion is now my favorite 2 player game. 

I am very happy that some of my geekbuddies made the sugguestion of trying out this game. It was a pleasent surprise. 

Check out the input of the deluxe edition of this game.

I still enjoy playing with the original characters. New ones gives a nice twist, but going back it basics is nice once in a while.

TRADED the game since I got the deluxe version.

Some tense information warfare and card play. The cards often come down to a 50/50 split on likelihood, since you each have two possible plays. This leads to some results being random. I hope that this will be reduced as I learn the strategies more, but I'm not expecting much.

A simple, fast, asymmetric and engaging game that takes the LOTR universe and condenses it in 15-minute games.

RATING: 6
A nice and quick two-player game.  I'm not sure how I feel about the balance of this game but you won't likely see me turn down a game.  The card driven combat somewhat reminds me of A Game of Thrones board game.  There is a deduction element to the game which may or may not turn some people off of the game.  I consider this version of the game to be superior to the original 'Deluxe' edition because it's smaller and less clunky.  I enjoy it so much more than the bigger version that I've created my own components for this version to upgrade it to a mini-deluxe edition.  The only negative thing to say about this game is that Fantasy Flight only seem to produce the Deluxe Edition now.

Edit: The Deluxe edition has been released in a smaller package with smaller components and I consider it to be the best edition of this game.

A very nice and fast battle game for two players, where theme is neatly incorporated into Stratego style game mechanics. It seems to go well with my fiancée as well.

(2 players) Doesn't seem like much here at first but like all Knizia games the richness reveals itself with more plays.  A lot of game in a small package! DOWNGRADED: Yes, there's a richness and good tension but a lot of the fun seems to come down to a coin toss in character arrangement and card play since some combinations and play are obvious. I'll keep coming back to it though and if I get really bored there's the Deluxe edition with more characters.

This game stays fun, and is probably more fun as each player gets more familiar with it, as the bluffing aspect becomes more significant.  (But where is Gollum?)
It's too bad this was extended as a separate product rather than an expansion--and it's too bad that the deluxe addition dropped the great artwork by John Howe!

RATING: 8
I always loved stratego as a kid, and this is a quicker, lord of the rings version with some new mechanics thrown in to mix things up.  It does play much more quickly than stratego and thus has a somewhat less epic feel, but while stratego can get bogged down by a huge board and unrestricted movement, The Confrontation is aranged in such a way that both sides are constantly moving forward.  The strategy is geared towards how to manage the attack rather than deciding when and where to attack as it is in stratego.  This game is fun and dynamic, lots of replay value.  One of the better 2 player games I've played.

* Played 30+ times. Best two player game I've ever played. Captures the Lord of the Rings feel nearly perfectly. All this in 30 minutes. Plays a bit like Stratego; or like Hera & Zeus with a board. Inexpensive gem. Highly recommended. Complaints of Light being too weak perhaps overstated. I won my first 6 games of LotR:C -- all while playing as the Fellowship. I then played as Dark once, and won again. I think it is a matter of getting skilled with each side and understanding how to use the pieces (much like Stratego and Hera & Zeus.) I own this. Will trade.

Assymetrical Stratego on stereoids (trust me, once you have played this you never want to touch Stratego again). This is a brilliant game of outgessing each other with an almost chesslike endgame. The playtime is short enough to make you want to play again. And again. Also the game comes with a few extra cards that can be used to make the game easier for one of the players. This makes it possible to play on an equal footing with my 9 year old. More games should have this!

RATING: 9
Nice and fast game. Althought the luck plays very important role it still has lots of bluffing and requires a solid strategy. The luck factor isn't a big problem because the game plays so fast that several games can be played in a short time. Actually the game seems to get better after you have played several games with your opponent because bluffing start to play bigger role.

RATING: 7
I like this game more and more every time I play it. At first it might seem like everything is pretty random and you don't have much control, but just keep playing. Once you and your opponent are comfortable with the game and know all of the character's powers, then it becomes a great game of bluffing. This is NOT just a Stratego variant. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
[Combat, Hand management, Special Powers, Asymmetric] {2P:7} Excellent expansion of the Stratego framework into something deeper. Again, Knizia uses the LOTR license to good effect, producing an involving two-player game that's well-worth an addition to any game library. The power of the individual pieces are evocative of the Tolkeinish character which it represents. The cards are a welcome addition, and allow some play off the pieces. Even the board, which is certainly not a map of Middle Earth, has some usable features (Moria, the river). Play value is pretty high at the beginning while players figure out strategies for both sides, which have proven to be very well balanced, if very different in temperament. it may fall off as the game becomes more familoiar, but I expect that the game will have significant long-term residual play value. Recommended. *** UPDATE: Finally bit the bullet and dropped LOTR:TC into what will likely be its final rating. It's not deep enough for the higher ratings, but its long-term "occasional play" value is enough to earn it a permanent berth in any game collection.

RATING: 7.5
Only played the classic game once. It's a great game, with lots to it. Lower rating for now only because I'm wary of zero-sum games I will lose to the husband all the time. Will have to play more to see. Plus it is an abstract strategy game in essence, and I don't really love those. 

Still, even losing my first play, I had fun (usually hate getting slaughtered by him in Hera and Zeus - this game was a lot closer). 

Prefer it to Hera & Zeus, but it is less portable. Would like to try again, though in no hurry to buy.

I really like this game, and I have yet to really explore its depths.  I have found that someone really has to like the theme to enjoy it though. Of the four people I have played it with, only one liked it. It stays in my collection because of my love of LOTR and the small box size.

Best non-abstract 2-player game I&#039;ve ever played. Highly assymmetric, yet both sides stand a chance. Light bluff throws in the required amount of randomness that makes the game enjoyable by all. Theme is greatly portraied: your heart will beat as fast as frodo&#039;s when time comes to cross the mountains. M:tG lovers will love this game. Only drawback, my wife wont play it because it involves too much fighting! ;)

If you like the LotR's, quick games, fun bluffing then this is your game! So much better than stratego with its card resolution and bluffing. I like to trash talk when the battles begin. "Aragorn is going to smack you down now! He is all angry about the Balrog squishing Merry!" So Inject some fun!

RATING: 10
This is a whole lotta game in a little box. The depth is amazing. We like to do as the rules suggest and play 1 game (winner scores 1 point per remaining character)and then switch sides and play again, high score wins. This adds another dimension to the game since you then have to keep count of your characters lest you lose by being understaffed, plus you get to express both sides of your personality, What more could you ask for?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Quick, little two-player game.  I've seem people criticize it because it is similar to Stratego, and it is, but that shouldn't necessarily mean it can't be better than Stratego.  In fact, if we are just talking about the similarities it cleans a lot of it up by shrinking it down to the essential pieces, and makes gameplay much more tense and interesting.  Then add in all of the rules that aren't like Stratego, and you have a great game.

A nice trimmed down version of stratego with the cards adding quite a bit of variety to the game.  Sauron seems way to powerful in comparison to the good guys.

RATING: 7
An asymmetrical cousin to Stratego. While the game has a much smaller scale the special abilities of the characters and the cards create a much more interesting experience although it is still primarily a bluffing game. The one thing I am not entirely sure about is replayability but for the moment I am giving it the benefit of the doubt.

Fun Stratego-like game.  The combat system, the various powers of the units, the map layout and the victory conditions are all spot-on.  Captures the theme well.  A good  guessing and bluffing game with a well integrated theme.
Playing this recently with my wife  revitalized my interest in the game - she loved it and won (she really really likes to win).  Nothing like out-bluffing your spouse!  I want to play more with her, because it is so much fun watching her have a good time.  I sold my copy in anticipation of the new verison having larger pieces with (hopefully) easier-to-read text.

RATING: 7
[b][i]Lord of the Rings Confrontation[/i][/b] is a quick thinking game of bluffing and deduction. The best part of this game for me is that this game has a shelf-to-shelf time of 30 minutes (in other words it takes 30 minutes total to set the game up, play, and put it away) and yet it doesn't feel like a filler game. Rather Confrontation has the same tension, strategy, theme, and fun of a much longer game. The only thing keeping it from greatness is that after a few tens of plays it starts to feel a bit repetitious. The variety included in the Deluxe Edition delays this for ten more plays or so, but it's a bandage, not a cure.

That said I can heartily recommend any game where my biggest complaint is that it's "only" good for 30 plays (especially at this price point).

[b]Deluxe vs Standard:[/b] As the word "deluxe" suggests, the deluxe version is clearly better than the standard version. It contains a mini-expansion to the standard version by adding a few extra options. And, although I think the Standard game has the best of the Deluxe box, the Deluxe extras are sometimes appreciated.

I hope you know your opponent well because you have to guess which of his characters he/she has chosen to attack you with and which card they have chosen to use against you.

I can appreciate the design of this game, but I do think it is overrated and drab.  It is tactical and strategic, but dry.  It is like Stratego, but the use of cards adds a lot to this game.  Even so, it doesn't add enough to make the game interesting to me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
All too often the whole game comes down to a 50/50 random guess.  "If he plays this card, I can play this card and win the game; but if he plays this other card, I play this other card too, and win the game."  After a tough struggle, it feels so cheap to have the game decided essentially by a coin flip.

Stratego?  I don't think so.  Gameplay is more like a hidden chess. Technically, there is no chance in this game and pure strategy.  For wargamers it's great.  Family gamers (like my partner) don't really like it.  Being the former, I give it a 8/10.

One time playing so let me explain my 5. I really like the idea of the game, game play, and just about everything else. But my wife and my first game did not turn out very well. My wife had a very difficult time understanding any strategy to the game, so she was very frustrated while playing it. This is the only game she said she really disliked. Thus my play experience was not very good and thus my rating reflects that. She said she will try again in a few weeks after I find some information on the web to help her understand a strategy.

Don't be dissuaded by the Stratego comparisons if you're not a fan of that game.  I hate Stratego, but LotR: The Confrontation is about 40 gazillion times better than Stratego.  It's one of the most astonishing designs of recent years, and my current favorite of the Kosmos "Games for Two" series.

The brilliance of Reiner Knizia's design work is reflected in The Confrontation's many facets, which cover enough angles to brighten the faces of a wide range of game players.  The bluffing and outguessing element appeals to those who desire a lot of drama and tension, or to those who like a psychological element in their games.  The situations that develop in the middle and late stages of the game appeal to tacticians and puzzlers.  And the ability to configure your forces differently at the start of each game allows the master strategists to hatch a grand plan and refine their skills from game to game.

The assymetrical aspect of the game makes it interesting. As in many other games I like the double guessing thing and while I have a problem with memory it isn't too much of a problem. With more plays this has grown on me. I used to think that it was a little dry, but there is a nice rock-paper-scissor system (with the figures) that makes it interesting.

Tendency: Will probably stay where it is or go down a little.

After one play:  well, I was not disappointed by the play of this game.  A bit of Stratego, a bit of Raj card-counting, and some nifty special abilities work together to form an enjoyable game.  UPDATE--Bought my own copy and played through several times with my sister.  As a result, I'm bumping to a 9.  What with all the German games that I have, I have felt the lack of a direct, in-your-face sort of game, and I find that this fills that niche well.

Due to the great reviews of this game, I clearly need to give it another shot. I saw nothing much more than Stratego when I played. UPDATE- I finally had a chance to give it another try (3/08), and I decided it is definitely better than I originally gave it credit for. However, I still don't understand the huge fan following. It's good; it does manage to capture the tension of the story in a very simplified way. The different powers and goals of the two sides is nice. I liked, I just don't love it.

This is an excellent and fun little game. I agree with all comments about it being related to Stratego as the basic premise of having a number of hidden pieces which each have a combat strength is the same. This game appeals to me more though because it is quicker to play and has added interest through the use of the cards in combat and the layout of the board allowing for tactical positioning and movement.

I love this so far, but nobody will play it with me!

The claustrophobic board and forced forward-momentum render claims that this is little more than Stratego utterly misplaced. If Stratego was so hemmed-in and relentless it would probably be on my wishlist.

There's an extraordinarily strong sense of tension and variety for such a short game. The thematic elements are solid, and the two sides feel genuinely different to play.

One of the few games which invariably begins with me thinking "How on [i]earth[/i] am I going to win this one?" Delicious.

This rating is likely to rise in future, assuming I can wangle any further play.

Improving on "Stratego" mechanics, Knizia manages to create a very interesting game that barely resembles its source of inspiration. Despite a certain abstractness, the theme is well applied via the characters' special powers and some of the cards.

This is a very intense two player game. Well, it's intense for me, because my girlfriend always seems to know what card I am going to play during battle. Thus, I have debates in my head along the lines of, "She probably thinks I will do X, so I will trick her by doing Y, but she knows that I will try to trick her so I will do X, but..."

Fun game, even though it drains me mentally when I play it too much in one night.  (Oh, this is one of my girlfriends favorite games.)

RATING: 9
Great theme, nice mechanics. I like to try a different set up of the characters every time. In the beginning luck is rather dominant. But after some characters have been revealed the strategy phase starts. Towards the end it almost becomes a puzzle game, because you can predict your chances  of winning for different moves. Feels very different if you play the "good" or "bad" side, but still it's well balanced.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Comparing this to Stratego doesn&#039;t accurately represent the depth of strategy and fun inherent in this game.  An excellent two-player game with strategy, luck, and bluffing all in balanced supply.  And for a Knizia, quite a bit more legitimate theme than he&#039;s usually known for.

A very fun game with a theme that is a personal favorite of mine. Well-balanced, at least with the "optional" cards. One of Knizia's best. It is a bit like Stratego, but much more tactical and with cards to manage as well. Playing each side is a very different experience, requring a different strategy each time, yet they seem to be very balanced. No easy task for a designer.

RATING: 7.1
Fairly simple game, much with mechanics like Stratego, but with additional deduction based on card play, lots of character special abilities, and quick play.  I like it but not a game to play with a partner who doesn't want to spend a lot of time "deducing" and "mathing out" options in a chess-like manner.  A lot of cat-and-mouse going on here.

A very interesting twist on the classic game of Stratego. The differing character abilities make it a bit much to keep in mind all at once at first, but I'm under the impression that this is where the variety and replayability come in. While I've only played a few times, this to me seems like the type of game that encourages and requires multiple plays to fully appreciate.

Update: December 18th 2014 - Rating from 7 to 8
Ok, so there is strategy (it's more than just bluff and double-bluff), and this game really shines when you have a regular opponent with whom you've developed some kind of a meta within which to play. (Although, it could be said that some characters encourage particular plays, it's when to break those patterns to confuse and strike that this game emphasizes - plus some clever maneuvering)

After more play, I've moved this up. At first I didn't think it had much replay value but it does have plenty. It's a really good game that doesn't quite have the spark to make it great. The inherent complication of having special rules for each piece sometimes turns me off.

You really have to learn both sides to enjoy this game so you can anticipate what card the opponent can play it order to set up defenses properly. The good and bad side are very different with different powers per character and different sets of cards. This is a fun short game with a great theme.

A very tense, quick, simple yet quite deep hidden block combat/maneuvering game.
After a dozen rounds or so the base tactics are obvious and it may begin to feel a bit scissors-paper-rock like - but then the new set of extra characters should help out nicely.
Can't condense hidden block/figure movement games to a lighter, more elegant form.

RATING: 8
I like it, but the wife doesn't.  Its a great short playing game, similar in play to 'Stratego' with a heavy LOTR theme that fits quite well.  Evil needs to play aggressively while the fellowship uses wit and guile to get past the much stronger evil characters.

One of the bests 2-player strategical games ever. Stratego on steroids. My favourite game of hidden information.

I like the asymmetric nature of the game. It plays quickly. Easy to explain. Decent theme. Packs up pretty small. Maybe I especially suck but I lost as the good guys four times in a row. Some slight concerns that winning/losing can be largely figured out based on the initial setup. (In one game an enemy took out two or three of my pieces before I could really react to it properly.) Maybe with more experience you'd learn how to mitigate that.

Gets better with every play. An amazing amount of depth for such a 'small' game. Also has the rare metagame element, where there are a number of different rewarding strategies and people who play often will develop counter-strategies, counter-counter-strategy, etc. Brilliantly clean and elegant.

RATING: 8
I've probably played this 300 times*, which is enough that I never need to play it again. Still holds up for the occasional play though.
Never tried the expansion characters in the FFG version - I wouldn't buy it because it's so grotesquely over-engineered and overpriced for what should be a small box game.

* it cost me £5, so it must be my best ever purchase in terms of value for money.

Another problem with a bluffing game like this is that to play well you'll need to know the cards and pieces very well. When you play this only once in a while you just don't.

There's a good chance I'm missing something, but the Fellowship seems to have a pretty decided advantage.  I know most people say the advantage goes the other way around, but I don't see why at the moment.  I'll play a few more times, but I think as of now I prefer Stratego (forgive me fellow geeks).  There's just not enough variety or strategic depth to give the game any lasting replayability either way.

This packs a lot of fun bluffing and fighting into a quick game.  Kill Frodo!  The only thing holding it back is my wife not taking to it greatly.

I have only played twice and won from both sides against an experienced player. I think that repeated playings will reveal more and more approaches. A good game but I'm not ready to call it a great game just yet. It is, however, a wonderful option for 2 players. I prefer to game with more than 2 players so this may affect my rating. Nevertheless, it's overall rating (41 as of this writing) seems way out of whack.

This is a wonderful, light quick game with good depth. This two player game focuses on special power characters positioned with Fog of War.  Many people dislike special powers in games because of the added complexity.  I almost alwys love them because of the variety they add to the game.  The only exception is a game like Hera & Zeus- where the physical design of the game/cards makes learning the special powers difficult.  However, games like this one, Jambo, Magic, do it right by having the special powers explained with text directly on the components.

The added variety of the deluxe edition characters garners it another half point.

Elegant (straightforward rules, deep but grok-able). Rich theme for such a small and short game. The course of each game will be different enough to encourage replays.

Probably my favorite game with no random element (except PR). There is a lot of hidden information, however. This game is fun, plays fast, has a lot of strategy, but the thinking never gets bogged down or too intense, because there is a lot you don't know anyway. Knizia seems to be able to produce wonderful games that rely on intuition, rather than outright strategy. You really have to second-guess your opponent here. (I only have the Deluxe Edition, but my comments here apply to the classic game only!)

RATING: 7
I enjoy the second guessing and bluffing here. The theme tie in is also quite successful for a Knizia game. This is light enough to play and enjoy with a non-gamer but played between two people who know all the powers and cards and this can be a real match of bluffing and wits.

This game scares me.

I get nervous every time I pull it out. Sooooo much angst.

That's a game. Not long, but the anticipation...the fear...I'm always sure I'm going to suck the big one and implode right out of the gate.

That makes this game a lot of fun!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Excellent game. 

The variable character powers, the cards used to resolve combat (and the special one-off cards too), and the twist of playing on a diamond shaped board (wide in the middle, narrow at the ends - looks like a gamer, in other words!) raise this above the Stratego on steroids that it might at first seem.

The play gets better when you know the character's abilities and how to expoit them. The two sides have different stengths and weaknesses, and play very differently.

This is an awesome two player game.  I like the hidden information factor aka stratego and the fact that it is a asymetric setup with different forces on each side.

LOTR: The Confrontation is a clever twist on the Stratego engine that teaches and plays quickly. Don't be fooled by the light appearance: there is more than meets the eye here. The possibilities allowed by the variable setup and the interactions between characters and cards are truly limitless. The most striking feature of Confrontation is that it allows players to scratch their Middle-earth itch in a satisfying way in a short amount of time. And that's something any game should be proud of accomplishing.

RATING: 9.9
This is a super game.  Plays fast but agonising decisions throughout and always different.  Genuine tension.  Twists and turns and surprise endings.  Could spend a lot of time analysing possible tactics.  The theme-ing here is amazing.  Although it is abstracted, Knizia has still managed to retain the core 'feel' of Lord Of The Rings.  There is not great slabs of text on the pieces or cards - each character has one special ability but it is so perfectly chosen!  It is strange that Knizia failed so badly on the theme-ing in Lord Of The Rings (co-op game).  The abstraction of the map is also stunning - who would have thought you could turn Middle-Earth into a map like this AND still be instantly recognizable as Middle-Earth?  Strategically, there is enough information here to make your brain work - quite a lot - BUT importantly there is not SO much information that you suffer overload.  Probably the best two-player game out there (the amazing Star Wars CCG is just too inaccessable for most) and is easily worth the money.  This is a solid gold ten in my book - the marriage between theme and mechanics and rewarding game experience and playtime is downright incredible.  Note that new players will almost always lose to experienced players - this is definitely a game of skill.

Deceptively simple - the first time we played I was severely disappointed after all the good remarks on BGG.  It took a few plays to appreciate the strategy involved and it's now a definite favorite that still is difficult to win.  It's also strange - having loved the books and movies, we have a lot emotionally invested in the game.  The first couple times we hated to lose any of the light characters.  Now we realize that it's necessary to win, but every time Light loses we almost take it personally.  Winning Dark isn't too much of a victory.

The Lord of the Rings as directed by Sam Peckinpah. A fantasy epic compressed into abstract cross-country treks and cascading body parts. Utterly representative of how the Kniz sneaks theme into his games: every little difference between the two sides in cards and abilities is thematically significant. I'd say there's a bit of luck involved, but my brother keeps beating me...

RATING: 7.5
Game looks alot like Stratego but instead of trying to get the opponents flag, the Light player tries to get Frodo into Mordor and the Dark player tries to beat Frodo or get 3 Dark pieces into the starting area of the Light player.

Rules are easy to learn and there is no luck involved. Placing your unit is tricky, it depends on your opponent where to place the orc for example (orc can kill a Light unit by default but only if the orc strikes, not when the orc is struck by a Light piece).

[LUP 16-Oct-2006] Some people tell me that I am wrong, but the last seven out of ten games I have played have always ended it was effectively a coin toss.  If I played card A and my opponent played card X I would win, but if he played card Y he would win.  Alternately if I played card B and he played card X he would win, although if he played card Y I would win.  Maybe my opponents just play the same way as me, but seven times in a row that is how it has been.

Brilliant game design - minimal, dense and satisfying game that can be played in 20 minutes. The mechanics that are in here work perfectly together. No unnecessary ballast that would distract from the core of the game; everything fits just nicely together. Bluffing, strategy, and tactics - it is all there. You will be amazed through how many tough decisions this small game can put you. And the game even fits the theme surprisingly well!
A real masterpiece of game design. Probably the best 2-player game I have seen so far.

One of my favorite 2-player games. It plays quick, is deeply strategic, and does secret unit deployment well: meaning it's actually possible to deduce most of the pieces deployed on the board. In my first 20 or 30 plays of this I always seemed to think that the opponent - whether the Shire of Sauron - had the strategic advantage. This is the hallmark of a good game, I think. It also doesn't take very long to teach. 

In addition the original printing is pretty small.

Fun and stressful, opposing forces have completely different characters, yet balances out.

The theme matches the game's characters and locations characteristics very well; doesn't feel pasted on at all.  I truly felt like the Evil Eye searching for a puny hobbit, feeling desparate when the unknown got close to Mount Doom and making all out attempts to stop it.

Even when all hope seems lost, a win can be pulled out if your assumptions are correct and your use or character special abilities are played.

It's fast, and well-themed.

Played once, won with a brilliant move, never wanted to play again. I know I won't memorize what the different characters do, and I know my opponent will, so I'd be at a terrible disadvantage. Even if I weren't, I'm not fond of these kinds of guessing games.

Stratego-inspirert, og faktisk veldig bra! Unike egenskapar på alle karakterane som gjer spelet veldig fascinerande, og med kort som legges til kampverdien til brikkene. Mykje av spelet er å lese motstanderens trekk og gjette kva brikker han har og kva kort han kjem til å spele. Det orginale Stratego, derimot, er det ingen vits i å sløse bort tid på.

RATING: 9
This is one of my all-time favorite games.  Taut, tense, well-themed, and playable twice in a lunch break.  It might not be the most strategic (though it has a bit, and some tactics and bluffing in it), but it is FUN!

Haven't played with the Deluxe Edition, but I'm not sure if I would need *two* of this game, so it keeps me from buying it!  If you see this, and you have an opinion on whether the Deluxe Edition is worth it -- let me know!

EDIT: I don't actually "always want to play," (sometimes it's just too nail-bitingly tense) BUT I think the design is so clever, and so well-themed, and so much FUN(!!) that it's definitely worth a 9.

RATING: 5
Doesn't impress me much. Well, I'm not a fan of stratego-games so this is the main reason why I didn't like LotR: Confrontation. If you like this, I quess you should try Senjutsu too: it's a little bit longer, but there is this nice "intro-game" where you'll have to put armors, weapons and all the stuff to your soldiers BEFORE the game actually begins.

RATING: N/A
An asymmetrical Stratego-like game themed around The Lord of the Rings. Each player controls a force of 9 unique characters (light vs. dark) whose identities are hidden from their opponent at the beginning of the game. Each player also starts with a hand of 9 unique cards, which are used in resolving combats as the characters move out across the board. The victory conditions of the players are also asymmetrical: the Fellowship player wins by moving Frodo into Mordor (thus destroying the One Ring), while the Evil player wins either by killing Frodo or by moving 3 Evil characters into the Shire.

One of the better designed 2 player games available.  I was a bit dubious at first seeing Knizia associated with another LOTR title after totally disliking his collaborative LOTR games but this one is solid.  While similar in play to Stratego, it brings in much more complexity and other considerations via special abilities of the characters and the card deck for each player.

Interesting Stratego variant which plays very quickly.  I'm not as big a fan of this as some others and I wouldn't rank it among my preferred Knizia games but it's an elegantly designed two-player game with nicely asymmetrical sides that forces both sides to make tough decisions throughout the game.

REVISION: After playing on ACTS, I bumped up my rating a bit.

Reiner Knizia -- master of Euro games plus JJ Tolkein fantasy world...who would have thought the story could become so heat when I was still a boy?  I remember the Crown edition of the story gave me the first glimpse of Frodo'w world and then a computer Atari Commodore 64 game.  So full of good memories back those days.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Nice game, with both strategy and tactics.  This game revolves in particular around the following mechanics: special powers (both characters and some Combat Cards), combos (combinations of characters and/or Combat Cards), and hidden opponent characters (a la Stratego).

I appreciate:
- the variety of situations,
- the surprises (who is hiding behind this stand?),
- the feelings brought about by the game mechanics (crossing the mountains feels "physically" hard, as does letting Frodo cross beyond the mountain chain),
- the manageable tactical decisions (deep enough to be satisfying, not complicated enough to be daunting and impose any significant down time),
- the strategy that one can put in the initial placement, and in the general movement of the characters,
- the short duration of games (which allows players to switch sides and learn the other side of the game),
- the involvement and concentration brought about by the need to memorize your opponent's character positions (after they are revealed),
- the possibility of handicapping the more senior player (with Special Cards).

And my son loves it, despite starting playing it at 7!

RATING: 9.8
This game is Awesome!  Would have given a 10, but it is not quite as good as Stratego Legends, in my humble opinion.  Plus I am a LOTR nut so I have to love it.  Note: After more plays I decide to up it almost as high as Statego Legends.

I like this game, but find it doesn't hit the table much as both players need to be familiar with each character's ability and how these abilities work together.

A more portable version that DELUXE (which I think we have).

A rather old (2002), relatively speaking, Stratego-ish board game that is loosely themed and based on LotR. 

A highly ranked (and regarded) 2 player game. 

FFG sells for $20 at their annual Holiday game sale (in November), but this seems to be able to be obtained on BGG marketplace for about $10-12. 

Not in a rush to get.

Differs from Stratego in that it plays with cards and certain pieces have certain powers depending on where they are located on the board.

Reminds me of a favorite of my youth, Stratego.  In spite of the high ranking, I have not had as many opportunities to play it as I would have liked to.  It is basically a duel game with a bluffing/limited info component (I like the bluffing/limited info element very much).

Love the art. Upgrading to a ten. Justin's picking up strategy and beating me sometimes. I expect this may fall once he's mastered strategy more and perhaps we'll get into a somewhat predictable setup over and over...but I don't foresee this happening anytime soon. The stratego-ness, the special powers, the way the cards, strategy, and psychology can work to make a lopsided battle winnable...those and the fact that I have someone to play this with me regularly all make this the best game in my collection right now.

We borrowed this game from a friend to try out - we are looking for good 2-player games. My wife was not too hot on it, as she doesn't care for pure strategy all that much. I really liked it, however, so I decided to purchase it.

I think that my rating will improve if I get the chance to play it again. It takes a bit of time to get used to the characters, and how they interract with the opposing forces. This makes it a bit difficult to quickly pick up the game. Hopefully, I can entice my wife into playing it more as well.

The thing that I really like about the game was the variety of characters. No two characters are the same, and their interactions with other characters varies with the character. This dyanamic adds a lot of fun to the game.

6/28/2013 RJ wins with the Free Peoples using Shadowfax and stepping into Mordor.

Charlie has been beating me with the Dark characters at a rate of about 80%, until tonight!  I win the first two.  But then, Charlie crushes me, losing only Cave Troll and Black Rider.
2/12/2015
RJ laughs as I seemingly clear a path to victory, only to have Charlie pick off Frodo in the mountains with Flying Nazgul.

2/15/2015 
First games with cards with Charlie - his reading is amazing!  He was a bit frustrated with the game being slower, but I think that will change.

3/12/2015
I haven't logged in a while. I played with Charlie for my 126th game. I am very skilled, but Charlie got even better.  Charlie says, "I almost always win." Charlie played the Dark Team as usual.  It was Even Steven early.  I thought I took the lead when Sam made a Valiant Sacrifice against Shelob.  However, I made a mistake when I used the Tunnel of Moria with Frodo.  RJ says, "It was a mistake because you should have gone thru the Mist Mountains into Mirkwood.  This would have made the game longer, and maybe would have opened up a path to Mordor.  Instead, you got crushed by Cave Troll, Charlie's favorite guy."

Feels like a more interesting version of chess. Your opponent's pieces are anonymous, you have to figure out their identities as you go, and there are cards for resolving fights.

A Lord of the Rings themed Stratego but better? No, A Lord of the Rings themed Stratego but BRILLIANT!

As a 'Spouse' game it took a few games to get right, the first 6 or so were all messed up with her missing or forgetting rules such as "can not retreat to an enemy occupied spot" and "no moving sideways in the mountains UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES!" was constantly forgotten, but once she got those little idiosyncrasies into her head this game became pure joy.

2 / 5 - Fair.

This seems to have many good ingredients: tense, certainly, and some good decision making but as a whole it just didn't seem to work for me. The LotR theme doesn't add up at all and is just bolted on, in my opinion and there's too much riding on finding out exactly what is where to see if you've got something in position to counter it and that aspect makes it feel rather random. The variable piece powers also act as a turn off to casual gamers.

Strategic and deep, yet incredibly fun and easy to play.  Even if you think one side is too powerful, just play two games and switch sides (like Memoir '44).  The game goes very well with the theme and it plays in under 10 minutes.  The deluxe edition has some interesting extra characters thrown in to add variety.

RATING: 7
played >200 times.  Best bluffing game I know of.  Plays like a great abstract but it's utterly thematic, and I don't know any other game like that.  No chance events (in the sense that the player's actions completely determine the game state), but lots of hidden information.  Each player's movements act like a kind of secret code, expressing his intentions, and cracking the code is a very fine art.  I am constantly surprised by the tactical subtleties, which I am still learning. A growing library of counterintuitive endgame puzzles is a sign that this game may be worthy of serious study.   

The basic game favors the dark side.  Some have said that the special powers cards fix that, but after tons of play, I have come to disagree.  Dark can play in such a way that Light's special power cards never become useful (or even playable, in the case of Gandalf the White).  Light cannot do the same to the Dark's special powers.  As a result, with good play, the special power cards tip the scales even *more* toward the dark side.  You might therefore want to play with Light's special powers, but without one or both of Dark's.

[aug 2013] After owning and getting rid of both the original version and the deluxe, for various reasons, I found the original again for $1 at a yard sale and couldn't pass it up.

RATING: 7.5
A stratego variant that is better than stratego.  It is much more compact than stratego, and with nine pieces a side the powers are easy to keep track of.  I don't have the newer, expanded version. 

There is strategy and real tension.  It also is over in 20-30 minutes.

I liked Stratego as a kid, so I fondly appreciate this gsme, which has a similar feel. Character powers and action selection add more strategy than Stratego. My only complaint is that it is deliberately unbalanced in favor of the forces of Sauron. Would have been nice to be more symmetrical, in that respect.

This is a great game but I find myself spending way too much time trying to get in the head of my opponent.  "Is he the kind of person who would put the poison in his own cup..." kind of thing.

Stratego + Knizia. There isn't much in there -- some bluffing, but rarely enough information to make educated guesses, especially with regards to unit movement. However the same problem inflicts card selection (to a lesser extent) which makes the game doubly sensitive to second-guessing. Not my favourite mechanic by a longshot, but if you don't mind that type of decision-making, this would be a good game for you.

This is another game that my brother introduced me to on my trip to Sacramento (visit Old Sacramento if you get a chance!). The game is a cross between "Stratego" and that funny card game where you put the card on your forehead so that you can't see it. Our other brother is nuts about this game and some kind of a gold-plated version. The only problem is that during every turn, I had to spend a minute trying to figure out what my critters and cards do. 

UPDATE: I finally played with my other brother in Albuquerque (visit Old Albuquerque if you get a chance!). We both got riled up, like when we watch a good episode of "Quantum Leap." During one game, my arm was actually shaking. Now that I understand it a little better, I'd like to play some more.

UPDATE: I finally got a copy of this game used for $6. I'm really happy to have it.

I was impressed when I first played this, but I quickly lost my enthusiasm for it.  It doesn't deserve the rating that I gave it, but I had to be honest with myself.  It's a good game, maybe even a great game.  But it's not the sort of game that I like that much.

I think the problem for me is that it's too confrontational to play with my wife, who is my primary opponent for short, two player games.  (Yeah, I know, it's got confrontation in the name, so it should be confrontational.)  When I play a two-player with my gaming buddies, I'd rather play Battle Line if it's a short game like this, or something longer and deeper if we have more time.

As a two-player boardgame, this is hard to beat.  Once you've gotten the rules down (after about 5 or 6 plays) it really flows!  A beautifully constructed system and no luck!

Wonderful. Plays fast, a lot of action, no downtime, great interaction, everything. I just love a two player game that is as balanced as this.

Get this one immediatly, Knizias best game so far.

Because the game is so highly cooperative, with open information between the players and no reason to not be completely honest and forward the team, the interactions of the players without the context of the game basically become meaningless.

An excellent game of bluff and doublethink. 
There is a lot of strategy and the setup phase plays a large role in how the game progresses in the early stages of the game especially. I find the game to be well balanced... I enjoy the challenge of the light side... sneaking tensely through the powerful dark side figures. In contrast when playing as the dark side... although you have more raw power... Frodo is a slippery fellow and by no means does the superior power of the Dark side overwhelm the Light. The challenge of both sides through 10  games is still interesting so replayability of the game has undeniably been good so far. 

Pulling out victories from near-death experiences in this game makes the sessions even more memorable and leaves a lasting impression of the game over and above that of other much drier Euros with less tension in their game play.

Clearly a great game and a battle of asymmetrical wits between two players.  Achieved the unlikely feat of being so thematic I had to go back and watch the films again.  The dark side has overwhelming strength and the light side needs to learn that, although weak, cunning sacrifice is the key to protecting Frodo.

The end can come quickly and suddenly, and it makes for a tense and involving experience, also fun and entertaining.  Highly recommended, especially in matchplay, and perilously close to a 10.

RATING: 7.5
Fun quick 'Stratego' like Lord of the Rings. When two pieces meet on the same square, if one does not immediately eliminate the other, then they play cards and add the value of the card to the character's strength to deterimine the victor. The card played could also be a magic spell. Each player has a similar deck, and must play all of the cards in the deck, before being able to reuse 'good' cards. Dark side player wins by eliminating Frodo or getting 3 dark side characters into the Shire. White side wins by getting Frodo into Mordor. Combination of strategy, bluffing and luck.

Very good game for two. I am a bit tired to play it after 80 games. But probably this would happen to a lot of other games too. UPDATE: after a little rest I started playing again, other 20 games. And I like it again. New subtle strategies discovered and probably there are still more to be discovered.

My tastes have changed and I am less interested to play this game at the moment. Rating lowered to 6.

A compact, fast-playing game of double-think. Also surprisingly well-tied to the literature. I think people give it a bad rap. It's a good time kill or filler for two if you're waiting for more players to show up for something else.

RATING: 10
A brilliant little game. I just can't believe how tight and well balanced this is and the theme comes through nicely as well. The rule book is exceptionally good at explaining the use of all special character abilities in every possible way. Somehow I really wanted to give it a 9 but I don't see any reasons for that.

Stratego with a sliding twist.  The "light" game for LOTR fans.

Not a 100 dollars anymore, but I don't feel that interested in reacquiring it.

RATING: 8.5
Excellent game.  Beautiful board and components.  Amazing gameplay.  Think Stratego but every encounter between 2 pieces, you and opponent secretly play a card that alters the "power" of the piece.  Add unique abilities to each piece and minor (but flavorful and tactically relevant) terrain features, and this game is a real winner.  My main problem is that after a while it can become dull.  My friend joked that we had played every possible permutation, and while not at all likely, it sure felt that way.  Amazing game nonetheless.  A great gift for a friend who isn't a gamer but loves LoTR.

RATING: 8
Vastly superior to Reiner Knizia's co-op Lord Of The Rings game.

Even though Lord of the Rings: The Confrontation has been called a re-theme of Stratego, its an excellent re-theme. Confrontation is short, but gives all the feel of Tolkein's books. Unfortunately, the theme is so tied to the unit abilities that players not familiar with LotR may find things a tad confusing.

I own the FFG reissue, but the base game is solid enough without the extra components. Plus, the teenier box holds the contents more securely.

RATING: 9
(I have selfmade two-sided tiles so I have a portable deluxe characters in portable form as well)

A very good two player game. Knizia's best game if considering how theme and mechanics work together. There is lots of outguessing and therefore a chance for bluffing and you must like them as mechanics to enjoy the game to fullest. If you do, this is one of the best 20-30 minute two-player games.

Update (28.8.2006): After few more plays it is certainly excellent game and therefore changed rating from 8 to 9.

One of my favorite two-player games.  Similar in play to Stratego, the small board, tense decisions, and each piece's special ability sets this game apart.  And, as with the Civil War, I'm a sucker for the Lord of the Rings theme.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A pleasant enough Stratego variant which is far too memory dependent and reliant on its fantasy setting for its popularity. If only there were a viable alternative to Knizia's "deck of cards numbered 1-5", but who says the Good Doctor doesn't do theme?

The Confrontation is an excellent game, full of tension, bluffing, and strategy. Nearly every game session is packed with memorable moments, whether it's Frodo narrowly escaping through a mountain pass or Orcs cutting a swathe of destruction through the good forces' lines.

I enjoy Stratego very much, but LOTR TC has a couple unique advantages. Players are not engaged in a simple war of attrition with the first side to give up a high-value piece doomed from then out. Characters make meaningful sacrifices to clear a path for Frodo, while dark forces have to be very careful not to overextend, opening a hole for the enemy to slip through. This game is best played with a partner over a number of games, so the meta bluffing game gets more and more complex.

Ratings modifiers : Only 2 plays so far (lost both), loved Stratego as a kid, like hidden value/bluff games.  Really enjoyed how the gameplay matches events in the books, and it seemed to have a good deal of thought behind the movement system and action cards.  Fun, quick diversion with a nice "bluffing" element.

After only 3 plays the complexity of this deceptively simple game is becoming apparent.  Our play is becoming more and more thoughtful with each session. What's more, the game is fairly easy to explain to new players.  

4 more plays and I'm upping my rating to 10. I love this game more with every play. With each play, the games are running longer and longer and each move is made with much greater consideration.

Pretty easy to play if you just throw yourself into it. As you play more you begin to see more stategic possibilities. It's also important to familiarize yourself with both side's abilities in order to play optimally. I've found this to be one that non-gamers catch on to--if you can get them to sit down and play it. My then-14-year-old son (2008) played it and liked it.

Great 2-player game.  Initial playings tend to lean towards the Dark side winning too much, but repeated play balances this out.  It takes a couple of games minimum to figure out how best to use the Light characters.  Another good'un from Knizia.

RATING: 6
The components are of very good quality. The rules simple and easily understood (I think). The games are quick, definitely less than 30 minutes. It may be that we are not following ALL the rules correctly, because the Dark player seems to be winning all the time. So, I rate this one at 6 right now since it seems unbalanced. Continued play may allow me to increase this rating.

Interesting little bluffing game. It is unassuming - a 20-30 min game, comes in a box around the same size as For Sale or Bohnanza. It's really a wolf in sheep's clothing: unforgiving with lots of interesting decisions. 

You need to play it a couple of times to get familiar with the special character rules and the special cards in the good/evil hands.

RATING: 6
Interesting design but somehow I never really feel like playing it. What bothers me about this game: while theoretically being almost free of luck as there is no dice or random card draw, the Rock-Paper-Scissors combat seems overly lucky to me. The combat is card driven with perfect information about the opponents hand and every card being really good versus a certain other card but really weak against another. I just don't really like that aspect the game. While playing I just have the feeling that I'm playing a LOTR-themed vartian of Rock Paper Scissors.

I realize that this might seem slightly unfair because there's also the stratego-element of moving hidden units around the board. But that actually is yet another rock-paper-scissors mechanic because certain units/characters are strong against one unit but really weak against another. And since you don't know which is which, you have to guess, which units your opponent has put forward. Really like guessing if your opponent chose Rock... or Paper... or Scissors.

Meh.

RATING: 7
It's a very cool Stratego variant, embellished with special powers and a conflict mechanism where you add a card to the value of your piece to spice things up. Which introduces a Vizzini element in each combat and decisions about when to play best and worst cards. What's always been of interest to me are those who claim White always win and other camps who claim Black always win.

With a little amount of luck and great amount of strategy you have to make your way to other player's starting location or kill the ringbearer (Sauron).

Beautiful board and quite quick gameplay, good!

Better than I expected, but still not my cup of tea.  Takes away all the crappy things about Stratego and puts it into a tense, quick game.

Update:  Must update my comments on this game -- it's fun, and although I've never really been in to Stratego, the influence is clearly there.  The theme drives this game home and will therefore be most appreciated by fans of the LOTR series.  Like, this game would be a 10 for those times where you have to switch the DVD over because the film is so damn long.  So, when everyones gettin up and havin a sandwich, you play this game and you're in heaven!  Other times.... well, the appeal is strongest with fans of the game.  That's the most that can really be said that hasn't been said already.

Interest level based on GB analysis.  Plus I still have yet to own Stratego, and I'm interested in owning another LOTR-themed game.

I've enjoyed Stratego, but found the narrative alittle disturbing, especially the bombs. Here the play is similar, with reduced set-up and playing time (hurrah), closely faithful narrative inherent in each playing piece and board (although the fellowship is fractured), with no anguish in killing a fictional hobbit/orc. Then there is the tense and fun card play when in conflict. The additional cards to help balance playing experiences is wonderful.

RATING: 9
Based on:
- quality of play, 
- components, 
- ease of learning/teaching
- playing time
This is arguably the best two player game ever

Surprising amount of theme for a Knizia game.  
I think I prefer this to deluxe edition due to the compact size - I keep it at work and we play at lunch
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
This game has 2 things 'going for it': that it has LotR in the title and that Knizia designed it.  Other than that, I found the game terribly lacking.  There is little interest in replayability as the board is so small there isn't much room to play differently from one game to another.  The system is basically Stratego: where AH made the game (Stratego Legends) difficult by the huge expansion, Confrontation is the opposite: there is little here. I cannot believe anyone could play this game more than a few times.

RATING: 7
Quick: Only nine pieces per player, a very small board, and pieces must move forward ensure a quick game.

On first hearing the rules, I assumed that this would be all chaos and no tactics. Almost false. For example, you have nine combat cards with which to alter the value of the battle. But there are really only three choices: either play a high numerical card, play a retreat card, or lose the battle. So in this case there is a good deal of second-guessing.

I'm hoping, though, that through repeated play, there will be optimal locations for each of the pieces in play so that there will be some of this double-guessing right from the start of play. In my only game, the opening game seemed totally random. Once half of our pieces were eliminated, the game became very interesting because it's easier to deduce, or guess, where your opponent's pieces are.

One other point: Although it's a quick game, it's not non-gamer friendly. For a filler, there's quite a lot of rules.

One of the best tolkein games out there....really.  Yes, it's essentially Stratego with a Tolkein twist, but the way in which each charater bends the rules makes for a great strategy game.  It's simple, but elegant...the perfect formula.  Unfortunately, although the overall rules are simple, you really need to know how each character works, so it somewhat frustrating for the newbie who plays against someone who is familiar with the game mechanics. (This is why some in my family refuse to play this great game with me!)

RATING: 7
this game is o.k. i'm not sure what all the hype is about. you have to stumble through this game a few times before you learn all the pieces' powers and how they affect game play. some of the variable powers could be more interesting, but i guess there isn't that much design room here. (i really hate variable powers where one piece/card/unit automatically trumps another.)

update: o.k. having played this game a bit more, it's starting to grow on me. the enjoyment of this game really depends on BOTH players' familiarity with the variable powers, the cards, and the movement rules. if you can find a dedicated opponent-this game will really start to shine. the level of tension starts to increase once the player's moves become more calculated and less arbitrary. the tight resource management, which is a game killer for newbies, also adds to the tension and surprising depth of game play, for a game in such a small package. the game seems ridiculously well balanced, even for a knizia game. 

also, i don't mind how the some of the variable powers target specific pieces anymore, at least not in this game. i realize now, after having played this more, that those powers are necessary for the light player because they allow him to bluff more effectively. the game needs to be tight to be enjoyable, so a more utilitarian power  might upset the game balance.  game rating up from a 6 to a 7.

Very clever game which is always tense. I like the possibility to try to predict your opponents card play and the excitement whether you picked the right card or not. Of course that is not for everyone and one might argue that you just could pick randomly a card but still if you know your opponent a little bit you wil be able to predict his choice from time to time.

Perhaps the best of the LOTR games.  Best because it can be explained in a few minutes, plays well, feels like the story (within reason given the scope) and allows for numerious ploys and strategies of play.

Good stuff - a faster Stratego with some rock, paper, scissors in the card play.  A topping of Tolkien, but really the theme doesn't work for me - Gandalf feels like a German Panzer column.  A more serious concern is that very often the game comes down to a 50/50 guess on the card play (typically an Eye of Sauron / 6  vs a Retreat / 5) which is unsatisfying, however the quick play means this is not too serious.

Neste jogo que lembra a mecanica do velho Stratego (Combate), cada jogador assume o um papel no clássico Senhor dos Anéis. Um deve ajudar Frodo e a Sociedade a destruir o anel.

Um jogo muito interessante onde os personagens ficam "escondidos" do adversário até que o combate ocorra, entao cartas sao jogadas e definem o seu resultado.

Okay so its just Stratego/L'attacque/elephant and rat, but so what- there is a reason that game has been a favourite for over 200 years and has been re-issued under more names than Lord Lucan, its a great concept for a game.

Simple, fun, and quick 2 player Knizia offering.  Much deeper than Stratego due to the addition of specific powers of each piece and cards.  Not much of a random element to this one.  You really have to read your opponent, take note of what cards are played, and also take note of what pieces are taken.  Can be played in about 20 min.  Very well done theme, especially for a Knizia game.

Homemade set, Star Wars retheme.  (See my comments on some GeekList for more details.)

You know, I'm not so sure about this one.  I dig that it's a fantastic game design, I just don't know how much I like it.  I mean, I *like* it, I guess I just don't love it like I feel I should.  I think it's the particular flavor of bluffing involved.  I'm fine with the bluff and maneuver of the hidden characters, it's once they're revealed that it goes down hill.  The part where you're trying to figure out which card to play:  "She could win it with a high card, but if I go low, she could win it with only a 2.  And if she plays 2, I could win it with a 4.  Should I play 4?  5 to be safe?  What if I waste the 5?"  I just don't enjoy that particular sensation.

(Whoa there!  How's that for a self-centred comment -- did I say "I" enough?)

About as fun as this sort of game can get, I'd guess. The level of "wait, he probably knows this is an orc, so he'd put Gimli there. But he knows I'd respond by putting my balrog here instead - maybe I should just leave it at the orc. But..." is collosal.

I was a bit hesitant to buy it since I really hate Stratego, and this game is clearly modeled after that.  Fortunately, the actual gameplay doesn't 'feel' like Stratego.  Also, the characters' special abilities match the books/movies really well, so it has an excellent "theme".  My only problem with the game is that this is at its heart a bluffing game, and I just don't care for that game type.

RATING: 6
21-05-2015. Rated after 1 recent play. In the game, you play Frodo trying to destroy the ring or have your forces occupy Mordor. If playing as the Morder player, you aim to kill Frodo or occupy the Shire.

The game itself plays as a Stratego-like game, in which you first set up your 9 plastic stands with cardboard chits giving names, statistics and special abilities. In your turn, you move a piece. If ever two different pieces are at one location, you have combat. You show the card and see if special abilities end combat otherwise you play a face-down combat card. After a simultaneous reveal, the player with the lowest amount loses their piece.

Game is good. I like it, but it's quite abstract. It does feel a little like LotR and the abilities make sense. A fun little Knizia game.

I am also wary of game based on big licenses, like Lord of the Rings, but this game does the license justice.  As one of the Kosmos small box two player game, you got to love it.

--30Aug2004-- Very nice asymmetric strategy game.  My nephew's review: (after 6 consecutive plays one saturday afternoon)  "Much more interesting than Stratego."  Faint praise, perhaps; but there are some similarities, and he can only compare with something with which he's familiar...

I have the deluxe, but, in regards to the original game.  Good, solid, game.  Good length.  I take any game down 2 notches if it seems unbalanced.  I think I will be raising this rating in the future as I play it more

RATING: 8.5
A very tense game, that captures perfectly the LotR mood (gorgeous artwork!). This game hurts, so I don't play it very often. But my son loves it. 

Playing Frodo and friends feels like some crazy kind of suicidal chess... Or choose the baddies and find out, that you're not so overwhelming as you have thought! The special cards can easily be used as a handicap with a less experienced player or with kids.

RATING: 10
Amazing! This game is special in several ways: 
It's unlike most other Knizias in that it's got a GREAT THEME (this is Middle Earth!), yet recycles old, simple mechanics. But these stratego/bluff elements with the small board make every single move an ANTAGONIZING DECISION. 
The game is ASYMMETRIC, but since there are equal size camps that claim either light or dark is superior, I'm confident that in fact it's well BALANCED. 
As a bonus, the game is very open to make your OWN EXPANSIONS with new charcters, and/or new special cards. Let's see how Treebeard does against the Uruk-Hai...

The best Lord of the Rings game is a two-player game, and it's not the one you think. Lord of the Rings: The Confrontation is a terrific game, sharp in its design and in how it keeps both players guessing all the time. It even manages to capture the "what is he up to" feelings of the original story, albeit in that weird sideways way Knizia normally approaches theme. It's possible to set up and play over and over again.

RATING: 8
I love all the different powers on the pieces, the tension caused by the uncertainty of the those pieces being hidden, how the game is assymetrical (the Dark side being much better in combat, while the Light side is better at scouting and manoeuvring) yet perfectly balanced (any group that says this game is unbalanced just hasn't worked out how you're meant to play either of the sides properly), and also in that it plays in what I consider to be the perfect amount of time for its depth yet still being quick to play (15-20 minutes). One of the *major* factors I use to judge games is whether the level of fun or depth of strategy/tactics is worth the amount of time invested. This game is both fun *and* filled with great tactical play. You're tempted to call this game "light" or a "filler" because of the playing time and depth, but its just too good and full of fun tactical play to be considered either. For solely 2-players at this game-weight, this is easily my most highly recommended game. I never play the Fellowship because I love the Orcs and Cave Troll so much :). Also, this is the one game I can beat Buckle at. He wins at everything else. UPDATE: Played as the Fellowship and won 3-0 against Buckle. I am the best :).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Very fun game, with theme matching play quite well.  If this is to be compared to Hera and Zeus (as many people do), I'd put this one on top. The internal logic of the game works better in the Confrontation, and I actually prefer the unbalanced sides. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
One of my favorite two player games in existence.

Sadly, when I explain it to people, I use the line that it's a cross between Stratego and Rock-Paper-Scissors.

And while it basically boils down to that, there is so much more going on that I just can't really describe.

Love it.

RATING: 9.5
I'll admit that each time I play this game, no matter if I'm playing the light or dark side, I find myself thinking, "Now HOW am I going to pull this off?"  But I've won playing both sides, so I think it's more a matter of making the best use of each character's advantage, and careful card play.  A wonderful mix of theme and gameplay.  And quick enough that you'll want to play it again.

RATING: 10
Fantastic, Stratego-like two-player game. Light versus dark, watch the hobbit-parts go flying. It's tense and exciting. There's bluffing and strategy, luck and bravado. And if a game isn't going your way, don't worry, it's also fast. This is one of my most played games of the year. I tend to find that the Light side is harder to play effectively; most of my wins are with Dark. The goal for Light is to get Frodo into Mordor or kill all the Dark pieces, and the goal for Dark is to kill Frodo or get four units into the Shire. Each player gets a set of confrontation cards, and each player uses one simultaneously whenever there's a fight. A numeric card adds to the fight value on the piece. The piece with the highest fight value wins. Some cards have text that alter the rules of the game. The exciting part for me comes in the mid and end game: Each player has only a small number of cards in their hands, and there are only a few pieces left on the board. In some cases, you can plot out an automatic win (if I do this and you do that then...), ala checkmate in 5. But more often, you'll see future moves as probabilities, and bluffing becomes critical to victory. Typical end game logic looks like this: It's Pippin (2) versus Shelob (5). I'd like to play Sacrifice which will kill both characters, so I'm giving up a 2 point piece for his 5 point piece. But I think he expects this. I'm pretty sure he will play Eye of Sauron (which would negate the Sacrifice card or any non-number card) to force a straight battle and allow Shelob to kill Pippin 5 versus 2. I'm so sure he'll play the Eye, so I'm going to play my 4 card instead. If I'm right, his Eye will have no effect, and Pippin will destroy the spider 6 versus 5. If I'm wrong, and he plays a 2, I'll lose Pippin 6 to 7 and have wasted my precious 4 card (my highest is 5). It's risky, because if I'm wrong with my bluff here, I'll be in bad shape, but I'm going to take the chance. UPDATE: I still love this game. UPDATE: As I suspected, my girlfriend hates this game. It's really not a complicated game, but you do have to learn the cards and characters to play well, and she likes to be able to play reasonably well right off the bat.

RATING: 7
I was initially wary of this game, since I'm a huge Lord of the Rings fan, and I had reservations that a Stratego look-alike could appropriately convey the theme. But no, the theme flows beautifully and helps you understand the rules a lot quicker than if you were unfamiliar with it, and a satisfying game of bluffing and outguessing lies within, thanks to fog of war and simultaneous card-play in combat.

I'm not thrilled at all that the Deluxe Edition gives you a big box of air and unnecessarily up-sizes the cards and pieces, which is completely dumb for a sub-30min game, and completely tainted John Howe's charming, revered artwork with soulless graphic design. I'm willing to forego the uninspiring variant in the Deluxe Edition to hold on to my out-of-print regular edition and its lovely travel-sized footprint. I hope Fantasy Flight will get around to putting out a more reasonable edition for this game in the future, much like what they did in downsizing Lord of the Rings into the Silver Line.

All copies of that LotR-themed Stratego game need to be seized and burnt!

My favorite two player game. Not knowing the identity of your opponent's characters at the start of the game adds some suspense. The Middle Earth theme lends a context to the mechanics that elevate the game to a higher level. Some tough choices as you try to anticipate what your opponent will do. Plays fast. 

This version is very portable. I would recommend this version (the original version) over the new Deluxe Edition. While the artwork is arguably worse in the original, the Deluxe is just too big for what it is.

So why do I only own the Deluxe Edition now? I found the original version in Korea. When it was time to move back to Canada I gave it to one of my English students (I played this a lot with three of my teenaged students). I know he continued to play it, so no regrets.

RATING: 6.75
A decent Stratego like game. Players have hidden characters from the LOTR franchise complete with different abilities (many of which counter each other). The bad guys want to nail Frodo or invade the Shire and the good guys want to bring Frodo to Mordor or kill the baddies.

Some tense moments especially with the cardplay but I can see moves getting stale and predictable after a few games. Don't really get the feel of the LOTR theme.

Very enjoyable.  The bluff and counter-bluff is good, the tension as you play your cards is delicious (playing it online at ACTS only heightens this aspect) and the puzzle of evading your prusuer (or closing your net on your prey) is a final clincher.  This is a fine game.  Play without the special cards - these are only a crutch and make things too easy for Light.

It has definitely stood the test of time.  Very tense and fun...I love the bluffing.  Unfortunately, due to all the special rules, it&#039;s a little difficult to to get newcomers interested.  There IS a fair bit of luck involved (there&#039;s a lot of guessing), but I personally don&#039;t mind at all.  Anyway, managing to make a very short and exciting game that retains much of the feeling of the books is nothing short of a miracle.  Bravo, Knizia.

RATING: 7
The comparisons to Stratego are understandable, but there is mostly contrast when it comes to the excellence of these two games. LotR:tC is far and away superior. Knizia is perhaps best known for his heavier games, which involve little chance and weaker (according to many) themes. And this one has a little bit of the flavor of his other games, yet the theme is very rich in its meshing with the game mechanics, and there is a significant element of bluffing. There isn't really "chance" per se, but rather your opponent's identity in different locations is hidden from you. As I mentioned, this introduces a significant element of psychology into the game and probably explains why my wife usually kicks my behind at this game. This is also an excellent game for those prone to analysis paralysis. I haven't found that my AP-suffering friends engage in their nasty little habit with this game. [Wife's #5 game.]

RATING: 8
Great game of bluffing mind games and strategy. If the replay value holds up then this is a total winner, but I'm not sure if every victory will play out similarly or not (since there are only a couple of ways to stop Frodo)

The Lord of the Rings flavor really shines through and feels right, to my surprise. Really didn't expect that from such a little package.

This was one of my "grail games" for quite a while, such that I bought both the original and the deluxe.  I do love the LoTR theme, but now having played it, I feel it suffers in comparison to Summoner Wars.  If SW had only Phoenix Elves vs Tundra Orcs and no other factions, then this game would stand taller, but there's 16 SW factions.  There's beauty in its simplicity - games are about half the time - and it wouldn't surprise me if I was playing this game more than SW in 10 years, but for now it doesn't have the richness of SW.

For some reason, I really didn't want to like this.  I had been putting off playing it for a while.  I would get recommended to me over and over again, yet I couldn't bring myself to play it.  Well, I gave in.  

This game is great.  I was worried that this was going to be nothing but Stratego with various powers thrown in on top.  But if there is one thing that Reiner Knizia knows it is balance.  This one sure has it for all the seemingly random occurences.

Still though, while I think that this is a great game, I just never find myself having a desire to play this.  I'd totaly play if someone asked, but I don't suspect that I'll ever suggest it.

Deceptively straightforward. This is a game of contradictions. It's asymmetric, yet balanced; short, yet substantial; thematic, yet abstract.

I will forever waffle between rating this game 6 and 7.

- asymmetric distribution of pieces; evil side tokens generally stronger
- board is much simplified, with different layout
- pieces mostly have some special power
- movement generally restricted to forward or lateral only
- most spaces can have 2 friendly tokens in them
- combat based on special powers, then cards played from hand (most simply add value; some have special powers)
- different win conditions: good wins if Frodo gets to Mordor or evil unable to move; evil wins if kill Frodo, if good unable to move, or if occupy Shire with 3 pieces.

So, is it really "Stratego-like"? Well, yes, somewhat; but it's a whole lot more. And very thematic, too! Sadly, I think the game would only really shine after playing it a bunch and becoming very comfortable with all the pieces and their powers, and the cards (on both sides). It would be nice to have a regular opponent to play this quick little game!

What a difference 6 years makes ... I think bumping 6->7.5 is probably pretty reasonable!

Superb game! Out of the many times I have played this, I can count my victories on one hand. Somehow, though, it still appeals to me. It's like stepped up Stratego with a LOTR theme. And the theme makes a lot of sense here. Very well conceived and executed game. I can't imagine ever getting tired of it. Unfortunately I only know of one person who will play this with me.

Crack in a small format box.  Wives, relatives, and in-laws will all play, drawn in by the theme. No real new concepts in the game, but the way they are put together with the theme makes it the best small-box game in the Kosmos series.  We always play 2, switching sides.  The player who loses the least number of Dark pieces wins.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Now here's a fun, fun game with character powers, irregular sides, and lots of strategy.  Plus the theme just shines right through, esepcially with the simple yet beautiful bits.  Forget STRATEGO, that game's a waste of time.  Play this gem instead.

RATING: 9
This is probably one of the easiest games you'll ever learn how to play and set up. Its like chess in that you have a limited few figures with special abilties on the tiniest game board ever. This is actually an awesome 2 player game that you can play in about ten to twenty minutes. There aren't many of those gap filling or 2 player games around and this definately delivers that demand superbly well.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A fun game, seems to be a lot more about brute force for the dark side, and cunning for the light.  We've played this 13 times, and the light has only won once.  Even in games where I've capitalised on the lights ability to instantly slay certain daark characters, and out-witted them in my card useage, I've still lost.  Fun, but seems a little unbalanced if you ask me.

Very good Stratego-esque two-player game. I'm amazed how Knizia can design games with two sides that have very different powers, but still manage to be very balanced. I'm never sure which side is better. It always seems to be the one I'm not playing :-)
Very short, but very intense.

RATING: 7
So I'm sitting here like a sucker with the NON-deluxe edition because I got this game long before the deluxe edition was released, and those greedy so-and-so's had to release the blasted deluxe edition as a whole new game instead of a cheap little expansion.  Curses!  Okay, now that that's off my chest, let me say that what we have here is another fairly decent game, especially for those of us in whom "Stratego: invokes warm, fuzzy childhood memories.  And let's face it, the "Stratego" comparison is inevitable.  But of course there is more depth in this game, and the characters all have various strengths and individual abilities.  Unfortunately, like "Hellas", this is another game that my wife has never beat me at, whether I play the good guys or the dark side.  So I don't think she appreciates this game as much as I do, and come to think of it, one of my other opponents (my father) didn't particularly enjoy it either.  But nuts to them, I think it's a neat little game.  Unfortunately the lack of opponents meant that I ended up giving it away to my brother.  Game design: 4/5  Personal enjoyment: 3/5  Total: 7/10

Quick Stratego-like hidden-information game pitting the Fellowship (wins if Frodo reaches Mordor) against nine notable evils, including the Witch-King, Shelob and a Warg (wins if three occupy The Shire or Frodo is killed).

Sauron's forces are generally stronger but many of the Fellowship have instant-kills against specific minions, so there's lots of bluff and double-bluff in positioning and attack. 

A very good game, just not my sort of thing.

Played it 15 or so times, and I am having a blast so far.  Very light, but with many fun tactical possibilities, and some strategic options.  Theme works extremely well.  Light and dark very well balanced, considering how asymmetrical they are.  Frodo is super-squirrely.  If I were a pessimist I might predict this game's rating will go down due to gameplay getting stale.  But I hope not.

RATING: 7.5
[FFG basic 2002 edition] {Fantasy, Novel; secret unit, fighting} LotR:C is a strongly themed game. It fits the story very well. The rules are easy to learn but it takes time to understand the capabilities of each character. The 2-layer double guessing (character + battle cards) really shines! It is highly tactical - positioning, movement, card play and reaction are all important. It is the best Stratego variant games I have ever played. Highly recommended!

It is a challenging and engaging game.  It is enjoyable when you can guess the hidden characters of your opponent and remove them with the special ability of your characters right away.  Replayability is high and you cannot use similar strategies each game; otherwise, you opponent can win more readily.

It needs good bluffing and planning to win if you are playing the Fellowship. It's easier for the Sauron team to win.

RATING: N/A
An awesome game for two people. 'Confrontation' has an incredible climate: it is set very strongly in the Tolkien Middle-Earth world. The forces of the players are not balanced: the 'white' player has weaker figures, but stronger special abilities – it perfectly corresponds with the JRRT book. There is an element of bluffing, tactics and the luck involved. 

From the gamer point of view, the game could be seen as a little unbalanced (the winning conditions are easier for the 'black' player) and random: there are some situations, where you clearly have 50 % of winning or beating an opponent figure. Some game's endings can be also similar to the chess' endings – 'he can move twofold, if he moves there, I should move there…' 


Number of plays: 15 or more.

originally a  9 when first played at Hunt Valley(2/10). I've looked at it more closely recently and find it to be strangely under developed and lacking a lot in theme. This is a tactical battle being played out over a Middle earth that is the size of NOrth America, for starters. There's not much in the way of faith vs doubt, etc. Each character seems to either stretch the limit of one type of strategic vector (Troll is a 9! other characters make you play car first!) there's not much in the way of making the strategies of speed, deception vs power interact in subtle ways.

 Even though it is pretty simple mechanics, LOR Confrontation does the best job of all the Lord of the Ring games at putting the story into a game format.

A great game! Each side has its own strengths and drawbacks. This combined with variable set up by each player provides good replayability. Plus the mind games of what the other person is doing is a lot of fun while still offering deduction. This all makes for a fairly quick game filled with fun and theme!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.3
Almost perfectly simple, but it suffers from the classic FFG issue of lots of rules clarifications being needed. Consequently, for a first play, you should check the wording of each character in the rulebook before moving them.

It's staggeringly thematic and tells the story of LoTR (as I understand it) in about 20 minutes.

Another Knizia classic with some pretty ugly production values (I like the map, but why the yellow arrows?!) - a huge amount of game play and a ton of difficult decisions, in a tiny play time.

Fantastic. I love the hidden identity/bluff aspect. My other half makes the comment that since both sides have essentially the same resources, and there is a counter for every tactic, that the game feels a lot like luck. I don't agree but can see her point, given that our first few games were generally blundering about - hopefully more plays will lead to a batter understanding of the strategy here.

Excellent experience.  My wife and I both love LoTR so I am always looking for good LoTR games.  This is one of our favorites.

I think it is amazing how Knizia has designed two abstract games with a LoTR theme that for me do an excellent job of re-creating the narrative of those books.

Further the game is portable enough and has a small enough footprint as to travel very well.

The game plays quickly enough that we often play best of three, sometimes switching side, sometimes not.

Would I recommend this for a non-LoTR fan? Maybe not. There is a lot of fun in the fact that the character powers largely FEEL like the book characters. 

On the other hand, the gameplay would certainly hold up. 

What other game could be recommended in its place? Stratego? Hera and Zeus? I think both fall short in gameplay.

I think I would recommend. There, now you can sleep easy.




Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 4
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 4
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 1
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 3


Overall - 3.75

Asymmetrical Stratego. I need more plays to decide how this plays out, as I've only played as Sauron's forces, who have the advantage of strength, while the Fellowship have the advantage of rule breaking moves.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Quite thought-provoking, with elements of bluffing, hand management, conflict.  All this wrapped into an under 30 minute package.  Everything you could want in a 2-player game.  I also think the theme works quite well and ties into the character abilities.

RATING: 7
Won in games for geekgold lottery April 2010. Great little deduction game. The only resemblance I see between this and Stratego is the hidden information that is slowly revealed. The tension in LOtR: TC is quite astounding for such a short game. Is that the cave troll about to beat my head in, or is it just the orcs who I can attack and smash? The decisions are maddening at times (in a good way) So far, I suck at this game, but I'm certainly seeing the brilliance in its design. Well done again, Dr K!

Traded in Maths trade 2011.

Nifty little two player game.  Simple ruleset.  I like how the players create the story of the game.  Nothing seems forced, it flows naturally.  Trying different combinations, and good player vs. player psychology.  Just seems like there is a "best" way to play, which is quite the bummer.  Very high in the "bang for minute played" category however.  Well integrated theme as well.

one of my all time favorite 2-player games. Perfect blend of game mechanics and theme. Sauron is a tad stronger than the Fellowship which is exactly like it should be, makes the game appropriately foreboding and a Fellowhip win is very satisfying.

RATING: 9
Excellent two-player game that definitely rewards repeated plays.  While the rules are pretty simple, the strategy takes numerous plays to grasp as you learn how the characters interact.  Although this game looks somewhat similar to the classic game Stratego, it's significantly better because each character has a special ability, and playing a card for each battle is also an improvement.  I just wish the new characters for the Deluxe version could be purchased as an expansion!  I'd really like to be able to have Gollum fight Smeagol.

While it may seem like there are a lot of situations (especially at the beginning) where it is essentially a crapshoot to who wins, and sometimes that can decide the rest of the game, I am becoming less and less convinced of this.  Nice and short, very strategic, great bluffing element (which I am a big fan of), endgame is always interesting...I pretty much always want to play this one!

Lord of the Rings: The Confrontation was a game I wasn't aware for a long time. I did know it existed, but I didn't mind at all to never get to know it. But, as things went by, I started to read and hear good things about it. However, I already had several good 2 players games (Lost Cities, Onirim and Battle Line, for example, and two of them also by Reiner Knizia). Also, it was difficult to track a copy down (specially here in Brazil), so, as many games, I just let it go. Until I didn't.

This game seems to be now my go-to 2 player game when I have another gamer to play it with. It is harder then Lost Cities, and about in the same weight as Battle Line, though the theme is much more attractive to me than this one. I also enjoy Samurai as a 2-player game, but Lord of the Rings: The Confrontation plays faster and is way easier to teach.

The decisions in the game seems always have consequences and I always felt engaged in the gameplay, even when one has the upper-hand (having more characters still in play or something else), because the balance of the game is finely tuned, and the winning conditions made the result unknown until near the end (but, like in Chess, you can see, some moves before the actual end, who will win, when you know which piece is which character, and because the used cards are open information).

At first it seems that the Shadow player has the advantage, since its characters are stronger in its numbers and it has the higher strength card (a six). But the Free People has Boromir, cards like Noble Sacrifice, and Gimli, Merry, Legolas can kill the Orcs, the Witch-King and the Flying Nazgûl directly, without a battle. This all makes for an even game in the end.

This has become my all-time favorite 2-player game. It is a remarkable combination of strategy and poker.

The poker aspect and card management makes this game a classic.

A very good "Stratego with special powers" that evokes a fair bit of its Tolkien theme.

Unfortunately, it is a bit unforgiving and you have to relearn all the powers each time you play, which makes it not work well as a game to play every now and then.  If it doesn't get into your regular rotation, it might never get played.

One of the better two-player to be released by Kosmos sofar. Even though the game plays in roughly 30 minutes, it requires strategy, bluff and luck in about equal measure. Without strategy it is very difficult to win. What pleases me most about the game is that the last few turns are normally quite suspenseful. Players need to know the abilities of all pieces in play for maximum enjoyment.

I love this game the first handful of times I played it, but with the same opponent, the game becomes stale. With new opponents however, you always gain an upper hand since it takes a while to learn all the new abilities.

Good for occasionally filler. The deluxe version will most likely have a longer lasting power.

Gets old quickly, newbies find it difficult to remember all the powers and significant other won't play it. Many cons.

A real gem.  When I first saw it, I delayed buying because the map looked stale in arrangement and the Stratego-like pieces didn't interest me.  After reading more about the game, I became intrigued and gave it a go.  I'm glad I did! It captures the LOTR theme much better than I thought a little abstract game would (MUCH better than LOTR: The Search, for instance).  And gameplay is quite fun, and full of interesting decisions, both with unit movement and the card playing.  All in all, a terrific, fast-playing game that will appeal to LOTR fans of course, but is also a solid game on its own.  Highly recommended.

Tight gameplay that borrows a lot from [gameid=1917], but uses unequal pieces to make it interesting.  I was amazed at how fast this played.  It's not an exaggeration to say that getting through the rules took 15 minutes the first time, then we played two games in the space of 30 minutes.  It's really that short.  Despite that, it doesn't really hold my interest over multiple plays.  I've played it 10+ times, but I don't feel the need to play it again.  I sold my copy.

Like Stratego (its pappy), this is a nice bluffing/tactics game, but unlike Stratego, the characters have different abilities that you have to know when to use to win the game.  As such, there's a learning curve, as the player who's more familiar with the cards will have the advantage, but it's an elegant game with a lot going on.  This is a 2-player game I'd like to see hit the table more often.

My first euro style game and although me and my wife now play this only ocassionally, it has a special place in my collection. 
Plays fairly fast and packs a lot thinking in a short period of time. 

There are chess like movements of pieces on a grid, there's bluffing in the movement of the pieces, there is hand management with the cards and second guessing your opponent. 
Overall a very nice combination of different mechanics. Also, the theme is fairly well integrated. Lot of the movements and special powers of the different pieces derive from their roles in the books. Highly recommended

My favorite game of all time is still Stratego, so I was very excited to try this one...and was then really disappointed. Not that it's a bad game, but it doesn't nearly live up to the hype either, in my opinion. The variable movements make it fairly easy to decipher where characters are, and it seemed as though a few plays would yield near-optimal setup for each character; the latter could be a critique of Stratego as well, but I think the metagame of Stratego, since you really don't have indications of which piece is which based on movement restrictions, fares much better in terms of replayability. I am interested in trying the Deluxe Edition, as I think not knowing at the outset which characters the other side is using would bump this up a point or maybe 2, but I didn't find this to be the Stratego killer I was lead to believe it would be.

Initially had some apprehension about imbalance (in favor of Light), but many (100ish) subsequent plays have revealed that it's nearly perfectly balanced.  Really quite brilliant, but I have to admit there is a hard ceiling here for me, where it felt quite repetitive.  Looking forward to digging it out in a few years, when I'll have forgotten the intricacies.

ok  game of stratego ...actually, i think i under-rated this game..there are many not so obvious strategies that come to light after multiple games..I've  started to feel rather endeared to this little game UPDATE: OK..I've played this game about 50 times now that 3 other people from my office have taken a liking to it. PLUS the fact I updated my original game to a mini delux (I love the new character tiles and adds a lot to replayability). With this experience I have developed a newfound respect for this game. There is much more skill in this game than first appears. Sure there are times where a battle goes either way, depending on which card you or your opponent has chosen. Most of the time it's calculateable though, but sometimes it's just plain 50/50 chance..but it's fun! fun if you go the wrong way and even more fun when you fool your opponent to play a cancel your text card when you play a number and kick butt!! I'll never get rid of this gem now. (updated feb 07)..sorry..I just have to rate this game a full 10/10 now having notched 23 games in the first 3 months of this year alone! Before I brought this game to work it sat on my shelf gathering a lot of dust..I would never have believed I would receive so much value for money from one game...(March 07)

Provides a very quick shot of tactical gaming pleasure, like a wargamer's after-dinner mint.  One could make the case that it's the most basic, quickest asymmetrical block game on the market.

RATING: 7
Very good variant on the idea of Stratego, and much better than that game.  The theme helps.  So do the cards that you play during each attack.  Another game that is interesting to play several times in a row against a single opponent.

Received in a Maths Trade. Too abstract for my tastes. I was hoping for a lot more of the theme to shine through, and the gameplay is simplistic and boring. Traded away in another Maths Trade.

I don't know what it is, but neither my wife nor I want to play this. We have played it only about 5 times. We see some interesting things there and the theme is well executed. I think it is that neither of us want to go through the learning that seems needed to learn good ways to apply the different pieces.

RATING: 7
A fun LOTR-themed game similar to Stratego. The board is smaller and you have less pieces, but each has a special ability. I like it, but my wife isn't so keen, so I don't get to play it often. Unfortunately, I think it's a very strategic game that rewards getting to know it well; hard to do when you rarely play it!

The two sides aren't really very well balanced, so you should really play two games, swapping sides and aggregating the scores.

Just 9 pieces to a side but when the cards are added many great strategies are possible. Games I've played are usually quick and very tense. A must have!

Kazdy kontroluje 9 postaci swiatla lub ciemnosci. Frodo musi dotrzec do gory przeznaczenia, Mordor musi mu przeszkodzic lub najechac Shire. Postacie sa ukryte jak w Stratego. Zdolnosci specjalne   karty mocy.Emocje gwarantowane.

RATING: 9
When looking at the board and pieces, this looks like an incredibly light and simple child's game.  But after staring at your position for 5 minutes in the middle of your first game, it becomes clear that this is one of Knizia's best games.  The intregration of theme is perfect.  The game is somewhat imbalanced, but forgiveable given the theme, and  the optional cards give white more options once they get bored from losing continually.  Truly ridiculous from a design standpoint, and a must own for 15 bucks.

Stratego was always one of my favorite games growing up.  I enjoyed the secret deployment of troops and trying to figure out where the enemy flag was located.

LotR: The Confrontation is an advanced version of Stratego that enhances gameplay in many different ways.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Good game. Basically a simplified version of Stratego with LOTR characters.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Easy to learn, but has some depth and nuance to keep it from being simple. That said, it features an element I dislike in many games -- the need to know everything about every piece in the game to be competitive. Not only do you need to understand all the powers and abilities of each of your units, but you need to be equally knowledgable about every single unit/ability of your opponent. This increases the learning/entertainment curve quite a bit for me, although I can see that it would reward long term commitment to the game. But for a short game, this requirement seems strangely out of balance.

2 player Stratego.  Not my style anymore, too much blind action.

RATING: 6
A nice thematic version of LOTR condensed down to a quick 2-player game.  Some strategy is involved but most of it just involve bluffing.  Fairly random with the edge seemingly to favor the Sauron side.  Feels merely average but I guess you could do a lot worse.

There should be more asymmetry in games. And for once, Dr. Knizia has managed to paste the theme and the mechanics perfectly!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
After 2+ Plays: I like the asymmetrical goals and powers.  Sauron's forces are much stonger, but the fellowship can sneak through with some slippery evasion abilities.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Like the game, but disagree that it captures the feel of the books aside from racing to the Shire/Mount Doom. Usually the majority of the fellowship dies and seeing Aragorn, Pippin and co. picked off one at a time while Shelob and a cave troll run into the Shire doesn't feel that much like LOTR to me.

The best 2-player game I know that is not part of the GIPF Project. Fast, fun, tense... brilliant! Rules aren't always clear and you have to refer to the FAQ (not included with the game) to resolve some special situations. This is why I gave a 8 instead of a 9.

A weak "movie game" that exploits people's desire to enjoy something related to the books/films.  "Stratego" is a far better option when it comes to this kind of thing.  Gave the game away.

Only two playings so far (one with each side), so cannot say much. Seems the bad guys are tougher, but I know it is just due to my lack of experience. A quick nice two-player.

RATING: 9
4-9-07 - Man, I had this game rated a 6 at one point.  I'm so ashamed.  This game is so amazingly brilliant that it defies all understanding of reality.  If you don't like this game then you are obviously a dark minion of Sauron who deserves to be slain by the righteous might of Aragorn (or Merry, if you're the Witch King).

12/23/05 - RATING 7:  I just upgraded this rating from a 6 to a 7 because I haven't played it in awhile.  It's a small game that packs a lot of punch and I'm looking forward to my next game of it.

PREVIOUSLY:
I always seem to enjoy this game.  Despite many plays, have never managed to play the dark side which is on my to-do list. UPDATE 2-23-5:  game has gotten a little stale after approx 1million plays.

My favourite 2-player game. Played 25+ games and I still haven&#039;t used the variant cards! I was often puzzled about balance, but when you get more skilled, the sides, tough very asymetric, are well balanced.

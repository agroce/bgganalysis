Visually superb and very thematic, the trading elements of this are excellent. I've probably rated this higher than it should be however as the combat elements don't work too well and the end game needs fixing to avoid the 'last turn' syndome.

Schönes Strategiespiel, welches gut aufgemacht ist, aber was am meisten Spaß macht, wenn man zu 4 ist, da dann alle Flotten besetzt sind und das ganze nicht zu sehr ausgerechnet weren kann. Es gibt die Möglichkeit des Handels und der Piraterie.

It's not a bad game at all, but it has certain problems.  It can drag a bit, there's some AP and Kingmaking issues, there's a chance for overly negative play, the board is extremely contrasty (the colours can hurt your eyes and make somethings hard to spot) and in a 3 player game there seems to be a distinct advantage to the Western players.

Having said all of that, I'd certainly play this if offered the opportunity, there's some nice mechanics and simple strategy and the gallets are great fun to move around.

Trade goods in the Mediterranean - or turn pirate and steal them. A good game that doesn't see enough play because you can't play with more than four and you shouldn't play with fewer. Also the bits are very, very fiddly.

It was love at first sight for this pick up and deliver game that turns into a wargame.  The love has dimmed a bit after three plays.  Though not played enough to be sure, I have doubts about the game's balance.  There's also a strong possibility of player(s) dropping out of contention early and having to sit and suffer for 2  hours.

Frankly, I don't see the "civilization light" description at all.  There are a few minor similarities but that's about it.  The game took our group about four hours to play.  It's a bit repetitive and lacks some of the negotiation/trading I generally enjoy in games but overall it's a pretty decent game.

RATING: 7
Economic and trading game combined with a combat and (sort of) conquest game. I enviably got the did poorly for my first time, but I enjoyed myself all the same. The time limit and the layout of the board makes competition and military confrontation unavoidable, which I quite like. While not a logistical, resource converstion heavy euro that became popular in the 2000s, it can provide a fair amount of AP in some people.

The board we played had a misprint (wrong colour for Rhodes), and the choice of colours here seem unfortunate (did there have to be so many?). Still, it's neat to see more of your men, ships and fortress on the board, along side (and hopefully dominating!) everybody else.

i enjoy this game quite a lot, but it does take a lot of time, and there is a lot of downtime between turns. i am also a bit sceptical of replayability. but all the same, a lot of fun.

EDIT: for such an old game, the mechanics are very elegant, you really want to play the game, but the downtime is insane. could be a lot of fun if everyone has an interesting book to read though...

One of the few Eurogames that requires a lengthy put-together element: attaching the flags (done once) to the ships. Theme is broken by the super-tanker/cargo-freighter appearance of the ship. Play is not bad and the variable game length helps. But can be longish and loses appeal after a few plays.

Es un juego de 2 a 4 jugadores, de comercio marítimo entre diversos puertos del mediterraneo. Cada puerto tiene una capacidad que debe ir rellenándose con mercancías diferentes (en el juego hay 7 distintas). En cada puerto, se puede comprar o vender. En los puertos que controlas, se puede además construir galeras (si se reunen requisitos), reclutar marineas, fortificar o transferir elementos de un barco a otro. 
El gran aliciente de este juego es que además, se pueden atacar otros barcos o puertos. Los primeros, para hundir sus galeras y quedarte con las mercancías que transportan. Los segundos, para que puntúen a final de la partida. También incluye negociación, pactos y diplomacia.
Es un juego muy entretenido. Además, muy agradable visualmente. Quizás la unica pega es la duración.

Lo cambié en la mathtrade de la BSK, Invierno 2014, en Febrero y fue para Nverter.

[Bought 2nd hand SE 2005-11-09]
A very pleasant game about trading and port control. Where you need to have a very clear picture about your strategy and how to implement it. 
It also allow diplomacy between the players, that gives the game a nice touch with all the barter. Which you can break whenever you want to 
Has also a war part that gives the game a very frustrating but nice ring to it. You need to know when to use the war aspect and when to just continue to trade.
Can be an awful game if you lose a boat in the first rounds.
The endgame can tend to become a real havoc situation where all players try to destroy as much as they can.
There are house rules that stop this a bit.

Good game with 2.. great game with 3-4! Back in primary school, my friends and I used to play a game with paper and pencil that this reminded me of as soon as I saw it. Lots of tension and drama.Haven't really noticed a problem with the "boat tipping" that other people mention. The pieces feel solid and bottom-heavy. Even with my stubby fingers, only one ship tipped through the game and that was due to stupidity. My one complaint: Some of the flags keep unsticking/opening, even months after assembly.

Serenissima is a fun game that is just filled with different choices and actions. It is not a difficult game, but a lot of little rules to remember.

RATING: 3
Looking back at an old comment I wrote about six years ago, I think I was being overly enthusiastic about what is in essence an average game at best. The game is slow to start, quite scripted too because of how resources are distributed across the map, and devolves into a nasty trench war at the end when harbours change ownership quicker than a politician can change opinion. The negotiations are a joke, remnant of an earlier age when people still dug this nonsense and could strategise for hours on end about it. There is no VP differentiation between small, medium, and large harbours. The combat is brutal, and the only thing stopping another player from taking advantage of the weakened state of all combatants is distance. The naval blockade rule is simply a stab in the dark because you have no idea what the long term effect of letting someone pass (or not) is. And why would a fat, slow trade vessel be able to stop a warmongering galley filled to the brim with cannon fodder?

All in all: go play a different game. Fortunately in this day and age there is no shortage of alternatives, and I hear the second edition fixes a lot of gripes already. Not that I'm in any rush to find out.

RATING: 6
Good game.  I like the conflict... I love the conflict.  But on the other hand the game really slows down in the middle.  That isn't a bad thing, there is just more to do.  I don't know that I feel that victory is going to be deliberate.  There are some strategies, but without further play I don't know how much better they would be than playing somewhat randomly.

Flawed.  The rich get richer in this one.  If you don't have cash, you can't buy an advantageous position in the turn order.  If you don't have an advantageous position in the turn order, you won't make more cash because your ships will be sunk.  A couple of turns like this and you're out of the running in the game, but there's still 3 hours left to play.  Disappointing.

Awful.  My god what a waste.  The trading 95% of the game was slow, clunky, and weird.  The last 5% degenerated into an out-of-nowhere mindless slugfest.  Unbelievably poor design.  Long, stupid, mashup of pick-up-and-deliver and a dreadful combat system. 

The pick up and deliver economic portion was really really weak. The map had problems with imbalanced asymmetry in terms of access to the valuable commodities and conflict. The combat system was incredibly dumb both in motivation and execution. You rolled handfuls of six siders over and over again for statistically assured mutual depletion that was never actually advantageous until the last round of the game. The last round turns into an hour long combat free-for-all that could either have miniscule or devastating effects depending on turn order. The whole thing was so crushingly long where neither the economic nor military part was well developed or satisfying. On top of that, the design, while attractive guaranteed lots of tipped galleons and pieces rolling over the board.

I don't remember especially liking the details either but those were the big things that were disappointing.

Big, beautiful game with lots of bits. Players play one of the four trading powers in medieval Europe - Turkey, Venice, Genoa or Spain. Players amass victory points over 8 to 12 turns by building up a trade network of galleys, and transporting different types of goods to ports. Victory points are awarded for ports controlled, money amassed, etc. This is a combination of trading game (early) and light wargame (late).

I recently got my hands on a copy of Serenissima in my game collection from a trade which I did with my cousin.

I have very fond memories playing Serenissima a couple of years back. There is lots you can do in Serenissima.

Buying resources, delivering the resources to ports for revenue, buying marins, even attack enemy boats and ports. You can control the majority of ports of a specific resource and sell that resource at a higher price than normal for a nice profit. Having the majority of certains resources is harder to do than others. Some resources are rarer than others. The main goal is delivering resourses in your ports and fill them. You get 10 points if you were able to keep your own capital at the end of the game. Another 10 points if you were able to fill the capital.

Towards the end game, it can easily turn into a wargame. That`s what happend the last time I played. One of the players went total military towards the end.

If you really want to kill a player, try sinking his two boats in the same turn. Spending 500 for one boat or 1000 for two boats because the player lost his boats in battles, leaves a lot less of money for buying marins and resources. 

Serenissima is a good game and very enjoyable. Will gladly play again.

French version.

A neat pick-up-and-deliver type of game with a nice intermeshing of decision considerations for the players.  I have to take off points for a few minor things though. My biggest complaint is that it's not always advantageous to go first. Also the bidding round is structured that the winning bid must go first. This, of course, leads to some wild stuff happening in the last turn, where you might want to go last but have no control over it. Lastly, the functionality of graphics and components could be better done.

Interesting game that loses out because of overly complex bits issues (flags everywhere) that make the game slow and cumbersome. The machanic itself could be interesting and there are clearly some nice potentials, but it got lost for me in the logistics of moving bits around.

Great game.  Replayability may be an issue because of the static opening, but it has a lot of strategic depth and left me awake at night, scheming and full of regrets.  Our game did have the final-turn warfare binge, but it was more of a release of turns and turns of minor skirmishes and trade building-up than some random free-for-all.  There could be a kingmaker problem - we'll see after more plays.  Yes, overly aggressive players could wreck the game for another player, so try to play with people who understand basic strategic and tactical decision-making processes.

Overall, a pretty ideal choice for a weeknight group session.

I really like this game.  It has a very good concept that balances economics verses warfare.  I do have one HUGE gripe though.  The little ships are for the birds.  You might have a bunch in a sea area and then accidentally turn them all over due to the fact that the bottoms of the ships are rounded, not flat.  I want to come up with a solution to this.

Very old game now by BGG standards, but I love the mechanics, the gameplay and the player interactions in this game.  My only complaint is with the components: the colors are difficult to discern (a la Railroad Tycoon), the boats, goods, and "sailors" are clumsy, and the flags for the nations fiddly and way too small.

It was redone in 2012, which I have not played, but hopefully they fixed some of these issues.

RATING: 9
A game a little ahead in time - a 1996 game that looks like a 2006 game! 

Reasonably thematic (for me this is important) and focusing on economy (mainly trade and port control) and war (ship against ship and ship against port), it has my favourite ingredients to start with. Having rather simple rules and game mechanics, but diverse strategic options, the end result is very good.

The game rewards fundamentally the trade actions, but you have to be able to resist military attacks or even ignite them to help things. The right balance for this is one of the challenges in the game. The initial bid for sequence selection is also quite important as it can turn you from prey to predator.

The visual aspect of the game is excellent in my opinion, although some players complain over excessive use of plastic. My only problem with this game is the selection of colours for the 7 types of merchandise. I have immense difficulties in rightly distinguishing the red and brown pieces.

This game is way too long for the experience it offers. Moreover, the combat system seems broken in numerous ways. For example, you often have an advantage to suicide your ship by attacking a strong port (this happens when the following player has a strong ship that is almost guaranteed to wipe you out). Other problems plague the combat system and makes it counter-intuitive, including an end-game battle-frenzy mode that can change the result on a dice roll. Finally, players can get wiped out early since you have an enormous advantage attacking a weak opponent. That is so unfortunate given the quality of the material and the nice commerce system.

I've only played Serenissima a couple of times, and I'm still not sure what to make of it.

I am a sucker for Venetian history, I am probably rating this higher than it is.

Attacking is too easy and it really overwhelms the trading aspect, which I think is more interesting.

A fast playing (light) trading game set in the Mediterranean.  Combat is possible between ships as well as amphibious landings.  Movement is cleverly limited by the number of sailors on each ship, with each sailor taking up one cargo hold.  The more sailors the less cargo, but the faster the ship may move.  Game ends after a set number of turns.  This can be varied using an optional rule.  Although fast playing, I find it too short.

Innovative game. Really like the economic system and the tradeoffs betweeen short term economics, long term victory conditions and war or not.

HOWEVER, game is not meant to be played by wargamers. Combat system just doesn't work (roll a die for each sailor, divide by three, that's a hit) with units (only sailors, boats and forts) and usual wargaming principles (ex:concentrate your resources, etc). 

We played 6 games and the point at which full scale war broke out just kept getting earlier and earlier. We decided to shelve the thing after Turks loaded up 2 ships & 10 sailors turn 1, and hit one of the Italian powers - each were wiped out. This took 5 minutes! Doesn't look like game was playtested by wargamers. We may tinker with it and post some house rules.

I really liked the game concept (conquest playable in 2-3 hours), and some of the execution (economic system), but not playable by wargamers. Game works if you have just friendly eurogamers, I'm sure.

Another one I wish people played more. Great game. Hate the damn flags though. I like commodity games and for some reason anything that has spice in it. Probably because I like the Dune movie and book so much. I think what does it for me on this game is that there is battle, but the outcome of them are ususally not good for either side. So while there are fights, it generally doesn't happen until end game, and there are only a few major ones that might or might not determine the outcome.

[q]Finally, I can make two simple suggestions that improve the game.
1) Score 1 point for each galley at the end of the game – this reduces the desire to sink everything regardless, on the last turn.
2) Score 1 point for each fort – this does give some incentive to buy forts rather than sailors. 
I have also seen a suggestion to score 1 point for each 5sailors, again with the intention of limiting manic final turns. However I think this goes too far, and if adopted it negates the effect of (2) above.[/q]

[q]When selling to a port that you control, you get NO INCOME.[/q]

Played once with the above variants.  Seemed to work well.

Keen to play more & see if it needs more tweaking to suit my tastes but I think it's a great game.

Played again & I'm considering adding one more variant - each good in your capital warehouse is worth 1VP at the end of the game.  (10VP in total for a full capital warehouse, otherwise add 1 more VP for a non-full port).

As a result of that rule I'm wondering if the income for selling at another player's capital needs increasing...

Read my session report if you like, this game rocked until the end of the world, let's screw everyone moment at the end.  That was such a crappy moment, I couldn't believe I played for 3 hours to have it degenerate into a free for all in the end cause no retribution from the screwed was forth coming.  

I'm upping my rating a little, I hope to try it one more time with the scoring variants mentioned in session reports.

Intricate plastic components and unstructured play give this a surprisingly old fashioned feel, more Waddingtons/Parker Bros than Eurogame. Some interest early on, but the only real decision in the game is when to make the transition from trading to combat.

Played only a couple of times, so my opinion may change. An interesting theme, fairly good components, nice mechanism for handling ship movement. Serenissima could have been a very good game, but it doesn't seem to work. The combat just doesn't integrate with the rest of the game (witness the last turn megaconflict), and often serves only to weaken both sides involved. Player balance is fragile, with one player being able to run away with the game if the others get behind (e.g through fighting each other). The game is also a little too lengthy.

RATING: 5
Rating based on only one play.  Trading game with combat.  Unfortunately, the combat aspect seemed to break the game.  In a two player game there is a runaway leader problem where when one person pulls ahead, he/she can just agressively use combat from that point on to stay ahead.  I haven't tried it yet, but it would appear that in a multiplayer game combat would seriously drag and slow down the game.  Finally, while the components look nice (especially the map) they are very fiddly to use with ships being easily knocked over spilling their cargo.  I would play again, but only if there were few other games available

Remarks for 1996 edition:

I think the mechanics stands the test of time and all aspects of the game interlock as they should.
That indicates the proper design, BUT the game is not in my style - constant scrambles with other players, pushing back and forth...  
Besides - turns are repetitive, downtime is present and the game is tedious.  That's why you can feel every minute of 3h (at least) that it takes.

--

COUNTLESS hours of preparing material before the first play - this is ridiculous.

Sold.

Excellent game. There's so much variety and so much to do.  In the end it turns into an all out brawl. I guess that's my only minor beef. The one game I played, the player who was losing made an all-out assault as the last player in the last round. Got some good dice rolls and took a medium port from the winning player, completely flipping around the final score. Still, I guess I wasn't prepared for it, so it was my own fault.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (December 2011)

It’s been a long time since I last played Serenissima. I played the 2nd edition a couple of months ago, but I’m not sure what chages were made to the game. I remember I thought at the time that the game was similar to Merchants & Marauders, but it is very superior IMO.

I have seen Serennisima (both editions) in sales and discounts, so I guess the game didn’t do well. But is has interesting decisions. I think Serenissima can be a solid design for some people but, nowadays, I dislike games in which 2 or more players gang up on the current leader to stop him from winning. My desire to play the game again is low and my rating reflects it, although I have some respect for the game.

Serenissima was the third game in a row of “Conquest and civilization of the Mediterranean”  games that I played within one month. The other ones before were Mare Nostrum and Conquest of the Empire. In direct comparison after one game Serenissima takes the middle ground. While Mare Nostrum offers more variety and replay value, Conquest of the Empire suffers from the long play time and the focus on conflict with less interesting civilization build-up elements.
Serenissima’s components are great. They successfully evoke the atmosphere of the Mediterranean Sea crowded by merchant ships and pirates. While the main focus is on trading for goods lacking, conflict cannot be neglected. As always in multiplayer games, the right balance is decisive. Too much conflict and you’re done. Too bad that it’s not often up to you to decide how much conflict you get. At least, Serenissima is played in a fixed number of turns to avoid endless leader bashing. Still, players should be experienced with the game to judge the positions correctly. As others claim, Turkey with its distant and uncontested position is placed best for winning if other players don’t take care.
One rule needs clarification: Are battles fought till the final resolution or just two rounds? The German manual is not clear on this.

This is a really big impressive game with a simple rule set. The trading aspect is great because of the unequal distribution of goods. The conquest aspect is great because you use the same ships and marines that are used for trading, and because you are fighting over the trade ports. I love the map. I also like that the game plays really well for only 2 or 3 players.

This is a territorial expansion game that turns into an economic game that turns into a war game.  Many people bemoan that the end turns into a land and commodity grab by force at the end, but I'm not so sure that isn't historically accurate.  When land and goods become scarce isn't that what humans do, kill each other and take their stuff?

I was introduced to this game back in 1998, during my very first session with a new group of hard core players.
After a thorough rule explanation we got going.

"Dominique Erhard's great game of trade, conquering, fighting, true love (?), deal making, backstabbing and all round fun! "

Yes it is [good for two]. The rules specify which powers you can have to keep it balanced. Obviously the board fills up faster with more players, but the rules fix that by setting a longer game length the fewer players you have. I won't swear that it plays the same as with more players, but we're certainly looking forward to playing it some more! 


[Mary Susan, '98]
Recommended. Although there is less competition for resources, there is still much strategy in dealing with the abundance. Personally, I think the game is a bit claustrophobic with 4. 


[David B Eggleston, '99]
I recommend Serenissima. I just bought it last week and let me tell you it is a great game for 2, 3 or 4 players. This game has everything. Trust me you will love it

The first time we played this game, I thought it had potential. I liked the goods trading mechanism, the way of collecting victory points and the general look & feel of the game. The second time we played the game, we decided on a more aggresive approach. All three players started with a boat filled with sailers for combat and a second boat for trading. Already in the first round one of the players lost both his boats due to combat. After some 15 minutes, the game was effectively over. There was no point continuing with the two of us. I don't mind if a game has a deliberate player elimination mechanism (like in Formel Fun or even Shogun), but it simply doesn't fit into the game concept of this one. ***** To put it shortly: I don't like the combat mechanism of this game and the potential of very early player elimination. I doubt I will ever play this game again.

PLUS
Uwzględnienie aspektów militarnych (bitwy morskie i oblężenia), gospodarczych (rozbudowa i towarowe urozmaicanie własnych portów), dyplomatycznych (pakty i umowy z innymi graczami), logistycznych (transport i wybór najlepszych tras), finansowych (ile z dochodów wydać na statki, żołnierzy, towary, twierdze, aukcję kolejności) i kupieckich (targowanie się z innymi graczami o ceny); aspekty dobrze ze sobą współgrają; fajny mechanizm statków: albo siła+szybkość albo pojemność towarowa; stochastyka walk.
MINUS
Raczej nie ma jakichś rażących.
SUMA
Poukładana, ciekawa gra zawierająca w sporej mierze element gospodarki i strategii, oprócz tego jest głębsza i bardziej wciągająca niż sie na początku wydaję.

PLUS
Various aspects implemented: military (sea battles and sieges), economy (build up your ports by diversified delivery of commodities), diplomacy (treaties and agreements with your opponents), logistics (transport and best tour selection), finance (which part of your revenues to reinvest in ships, soldiers, goods, forts, bidding for player order) and trading (bargaining with your opponents); aspects are well inter-coordinated; nice ship mechanism: strength+speed versus capacity; stochastic of battles.
MINUS
No obvious weaknesses.
SUM
Well regulated and interesting game containing a considerable amount of interlinked economy and strategy, besides it's deeper and more compelling than the first impression.

Awesome components (once you get past the 12-hour ordeal of assembling them), and excellent player aids, and some clever ideas (more guys in a boat means you're faster & tougher, but can carry less cargo), but the way trade works is so goofy & gamey that the word "simulation" shouldn't be on the back of the box.  (Once someone sells iron at a port, no one can ever sell iron there again, nor can anyone ever [i]buy[/i] iron there.)

For another game by the same designers, I recommend Condottiere (also not a simulation, but a lot more fun!)

(Traded to Foretfam 10/30/06; this is a beautiful game, but I was just never in the mood for it.)

This game can be enjoyable. It can also be a drag with the wrong group of players. The last time I played another player crippled himself to cripple another player one turn one, effectively turning the game into a three-player game. A definite drag.

(11-07-07) The game is an interesting balance of combat and trading. The more men you put on your boats, the better it does in combat and the further it moves. You sacrifice cargo holding capacity to do this. On the flip side, you have a slow boat loaded with cargo - its an easy target. 

Fine game. The components are well done, fairly standard eurogame bits. Plastic boats, men, commodities and forts. The map is nicely done.

- La mécanique du jeu est tendancieuse. Au début de partie à tendance "développement commercial" succédera, en fin de partie, une "course à l'armement".

+ Le thème bien rendu et l'esthétisme classique du jeu.
+ La fluidité des tours
+ La gestion des navires (marins/marchandises)

Maybe it is just me, but I don't "get" the game. Every time I played I ended up last; usually I concentrate too much on war and not on trade, but I've lost also doing the opposite.
There is definitely something very good in the game (a lot of people in my group ask for it) but for now it has my veto.

New in collection july 08, finally played oct '10...

The mixture of trade and warfare is good, the ships are a nice (but fiddly) touch. Good game, but all in all the game takes a little too long for what it is. Guess it hasn't aged too well.

Update nov 10: Sold, since it otherwise probably wouldn't have been played again (my gamegroup didn't like it that much)

I like this because you can play a strategy of trading for wealth, trading to build your empire, conquering and piracy, or a combination. This has a lot of replay value and can appeal to different players. The main weakness is the mad rush of combat in the final turn (fix with house rules).

The opening positions are not balanced and this bugs the hell out of some players.

I enjoy this game.  My only complaint is how attrition from scrapes reduces ones chances of winning.  (I feel it's very difficult to successfully combine warring with euro mechanics.)

Someone attacks you and you suffer loss.  Attack back and you'll still suffer some loss (men) even if you win back some booty.  All of this means that a player not involved in scrapes will have suffered no loss and in a game about being efficient this offers a significant advantage.  So, counterintuitive as it is, it probably makes sense when you're attacked to instead attack some innocent bystander rather than retaliate if only balance the effects of loss.  Otherwise the cumulative effect of attrition will have that bystander win.

If this issue could be alleviated (or if someone could show me how I'm mistaken) my opinion of the game would improve quite a bit.  The feel and mechanics of the game are otherwise great.

Great pick up and deliver conquest game.  The first half of the game primarily involves taking over ports and cashing in commodities for ducats.  There are some tough decisions since we play that you do not make any money when you deliver goods to your own ports.  Fighting, especially in the beginning of the game is very expensive so it shouldn't happen often unless you're trying to break up a monopoly.  Cash is very important in the first half of the game and it's probably a good idea to build up a large army of soldiers and ships for the final 2 phases.  You gain (the most) victory points at the end of the game for owning filled ports so the endgame involves defending your valuable ports and trying to take over as many other ports as you can.

Played it once, and liked it.  There's a strong theme, and that's something I look for in a game.  Quite challenging choices, especially the choice of going to war or just trying to trade.  Unfortunately it seems the last turn or 2 it turns into a free for all as you try to pick off weak ports from your competitors.  The bidding mechanic for play order is also a bit clumsy as more often than not nobody bids it seems...

Score has increased after several plays, each time with different players.  All were very enthousiastic and willing to play again.  Playing time for all sessions was almost 4 hours to complete but the game keeps you hooked every second.  I prefer to extend the number of playingrounds to increase use of trading and conflict during gameplay.   8 rounds just seem to short (not in playing time though). ps: We played with additonal rule of 1 point per boat and 1 point per 10 seefarers to balance trading and conquering during game.

In the Mediterranian sea, players are building galleys, sailing to find commodities, then selling for a profit. Warfare can erupt between galleys. It's a slightly longer game and suffers from the well known end game problem; people have galleys around with no purpose and start random attacks.

Great trading game.  It is played with 4 players, 3 is ok, but really reserve this game for 4 players.  With 4, this game can be pretty intense.  Highly recommended.  Beautiful art, though the pieces are quite fiddily.  Despite this, I really enjoy the game.  Combat is extremely risky in this game.  Diplomancy and just a little piracy (mixed with threats) are usually your best options.  The game gets extremely interesting in the last turn or two.

I like the idea of the game with its balance of economic and war game features. I have only played once (3 players) and we played with some of the variant rules found here (i.e.: we got points for boats, sailors,... and most important, we were able to sell goods in our occupied cities, but we didn´t get any money for it). I found that there are lot of hard decisions to make during the game and you need to have a clear strategy from the very first turn in order to succeed. As for the duration of the game, it felt a bit too long.
However, I think that Serenissima has playability issues concerning the materials, color choices, ... and how all the game bits have been designed. For example:
-It is not easy to distinguish your own boats on the board, since the sailors are all blue and the tiny flag is just not enough, specially when the board gets more and more crowded.
-The color choices made complicated to see whether a city produced wine or wood.
-The sailors in the cities get easily all over the place and then you don´t know anymore whose player they are.
-There were not enough flag bases to mark all the cities we conquered and we had to simply lay the player´s flag by the city, which didn´t add much visibility on which player owns the city.
-....

All and all, a good game idea but the execution doesn´t live up to it. Maybe the 2012 re-edition of this game will solve these issues.

Great looking trading game with a huge helping of naval battles. Simple rules means you can quickly start trading and more importantly sink your rivals ships. It's all good fun, but gets bogged down towards the end as the trading becomes overly restrictive and strategy gets totally blown out of the water by the chaotic nature of the last few, combat heavy, turns - by this point the game can drag a little.

I really like the trading around the Med premise that shines through the early rounds (with the odd rogue ship to be wary of). The threat of danger rises as the game progresses, until the end of the game turns into a kingmaking, raid the hell out of everything procession. Which overwhelms the efforts placed into the earlier rounds. At a 3 hour length, it feels a little unfair and so it enjoys the occasional play but is not a regular event.

I tend to enjoy pick-up-and-deliver games, and this one was fun, though the combat aspect seems to bring out a little paranoia in players.  There's a lot of things to think about here, from trying to claim as many ports as possible, trying to fill up your ports and capital, and trying to make a buck by peddling rare goods.  Oh, and piracy.  Overall, the various strategies seem to be relatively well-balanced, but since there are a lot of options, the game will play very slowly with new or AP-prone players.

Played twice, okay. Can be viscious, and I am disappointed by ability to ruin the game in the first few turns by poor play (inadvertant kingmaking). Caution new players, perhaps even house rule of no fighting in turns 1-3.

Another favorite. Balanced between trading and warfare. Remember you win by controlling full cities and having money. Getting others to help fill your warehouses is necessary. Warfare is expensive but sometimes also necessary, also the threat of force can drive advantageous trades. Also best not to hold a grudge the person who just attacked you this turn may be a friend in next. Best to use the endgame variants of the boats and sailors have value or variable turn end.
I would only play the game with the full compliment of 4 players

**update: i really like this game, so i'm upping it a point from my previous rating.   this is a pretty good pick up and deliver game with some light warfare. the last turn can boil down to an insane bloodletting, but this only highlights the need to balance your economic empire with your military strength. if you spread yourself too thin, you will come up short in the end. how can this surprise anybody?

Far meatier and interesting theme than most Euro games, although at its core is an abstract resource collection mechanic. Trading and set collecting is far more important than combat (usually detremental unless taking out full ports towards the end of the game). Involving four player but doesn&#039;t really work as a two-three player as money is too plentiful. Phase one of the game (building and trading) is overly fiddly and can result in a lot of down time. Unsure if sudden death or random ending is the way to go - as it is, I always start looking at my watch and tapping my feet half way through each game I&#039;ve played.

Too much down-time and some issues of balance, but I didn't mind the World War at the end. Hansa is a similar trading game but considerably quicker.

I played it only once, so take this comment with a grain of salt: My impression was that it was too easy to win the game decisively by following a "wargame-approach" that is first attacking with galleons loaded with soldieres the others. I won the game that way, but it felt boring.

--11Sept2004-- Fun bin-packing game ostensibly set in the Mediterranean.  Piracy; bookkeeping; weak endgame; little ships that fall over at inopportune moments, disgorging their cargo all over the board:  all here.  #1 son (9 as of this entry) loves it, though.
--May2015-- On reflection, I'm not convinced the weak endgame is quite the truth.  In the most recent game we started attacking early; and, frankly, the game made more sense that way.

Tense, cut-throat naval trading game (with some conflict). Found the game a bit simplistic with 2 players and a bit chaotic and slightly unbalanced with 4 players. 3 players also too imbalanced. The game requires 4 experienced players to be fun.

Beautiful and original game. I love the direct non-abstract style of playing of this game, with the ships that are sailing through the Mediterranean on the board. And still it is nice and tight like a German boardgame, not like a simulation game. My wife is generally not very much into longer-running conflict heavy games, but this is a big exception for her. So this is still hitting the table once or twice per year.

Bon, tout d'abord, une petite formalité d'usage : je n'ai joué à Méditerranée que quatre ou cinq fois, et ça remonte à plus de trois ans. J'écris donc cet avis de mémoire et le mettrai sans doute à jour après ma prochaine partie, même si elle n'aura sans doute pas lieu à court terme.

En effet, je me souviens surtout d'un jeu un peu « le cul entre deux chaises ». Le début de la partie ressemble à un gros jeu de logistique à l'allemande, et puis tout explose : les joueurs s'arment, des équipes fragiles se forment, les premières galères coulent. Et là, on a bien vite l'impression que le début de partie n'a pas servi à grand chose, sinon à choisir sur quel joueur taper et contre lequel il faut se liguer : celui qui a ses ports les plus pleins. Dès lors, les galères « à cinq » se multiplient, et le dernier à avoir planté son couteau dans le dos de son voisin remporte la partie.

Le jeu n'est pas vraiment hasardeux, mais extrêmement violent. Les premières galères armées détruisent tout sur leur passage, s'engouffrent dans le moindre trou de blocus, détruisent le moindre port qu'on n'a pas eu le temps ou les moyens de blinder.

Au final, j'ai un ressenti d'un jeu très frustrant, où on ne construit que pour voir tout détruire par le joueur le plus opportuniste, transformant un jeu qui aurait pu être stratégique en un pur jeu « de putes ». La violence d'un [gameid=265] étalée sur plusieurs heures de jeu, car Méditerranée a ce petit côté un peu « vieux jeu » des [gameid=181]-like s'étalant sur plus de trois à quatre heures…

RATING: 2
I so very much wanted to like this game - the beauty of the board and the subject matter made me long to buy it. I'm glad I played before I bought(well, didn't buy): it was LONG, tedious, boring, and ended in a very frustrating several rounds of combat (since there was nothing else to do). The game seemed disjointed (the connection between trading and combat was weak, and players were forced to do things simply because there were so many rounds left to play, rather than because the internal logic of the game required it or made us feel like it was necessary). The bits stink, and the sequence of actions in each turn seemed confused.  All in all, this game was certainly NOT FUN!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Great fun. Clever system. Just be careful not to let newbies do something dumb on their first turn, or Turkey run away with the eastern side of the board unopposed. Can be played more as a wargame or as a trading game, but that usually depends on how vulnerable players leave their ships - especially the ones loaded with cargo. Inevitably though the game descends into warfare as trading goods run out and city spaces are filled. Love it for a twice a year game.

RATING: 4
A Long time favourite, which I seldom get to play. Most people find it chaotic. Others say the game has balance issues, or kingmaker, kingbasher problems. All of that has not been a problem for me to date. Although that could be because I simply can't find enough opponents to stick with the game for a longer period. The flags on ships and in ports can be chaotic sometimes, but overall, it's a really good transportation aka wargame. With all those (better) games at my disposal, I don't think this is one I'm 'usually' willing to play, per the BGG scoring. It's still fun and quite challenging, so a 6 is on the spot for now.

Update 2015-04: this one has had it's best days. It's time to move on. We played with a variant rule set and some people were complaining that the game had no real interactivity going on at all. Which was true, even though we were playing with the rule that doesn't allow you to sell for cash at your own ports. This did not lead to any interaction of any sorts what so ever. Which was really a shame as it did away with even the smooth "daisy chaining" your routes efficiently without replacing it with something better.

As it stands the game just doesn't hold up. Even with the mix of variant rules borrowed from the 2nd edition and from the community. The variant rules will be posted in the variant section.

I guess this can be a very good game. The manual makes sense, the mechanics look good, the material is gorgeous. But... ..it confuses me. I am unable to keep track of all the stuff that is going on (Especially the demand is impossible for me to keep track of.) I have no problem with this in games like Puerto Rico or Agricola, but this just seems like too much work. The decisions themselves are hidden so deep that tracking them is harder than the decision itself. It is brain-burning to me, but not in a good way.

RATING: 9
This is the kind of game that only gets out to the table once a year, but when it gets some action, this gem really sparkles.  I've only played it with two and three players, so I haven't experienced the "favoring" toward the turks.  My experience with two and three though has been incredible.  One of the greatest pickup and deliver games.  Great movement system, and has a wonderful balance between income and victory points.  The simple battle system is appealing as well.  I prefer to play with the "incorrect rules translation" that states that you can't get money from selling goods to your own port.  This really charges up the dynamics of the game.  The only reason why this doesn't get a 10 is the fragile first/second turn which can virtually (or actually) eliminate players.  Please note it ahead of time and make some constraints as to not attack each other on the first round, and the game works out quite well.  The endgame problem that people complain about is fine.  I don't see what the issue is if people prepare for it (and you know two turns in advance that people are going to try to scrape any point possible on the last turn).  Can't wait to play it next year.

Very appealing to the eye, and a wonderful development of the theme. It's a game I would want to own even if I never played it. On the down side, though the rules are simple, there are a lot of bits to keep track of, and the action tends to drag as the game progresses and there are more bits on the board.

A really cool economic/trading game.  Plenty of player interaction, and the bits in this one are really, really beautiful!  I like how you're trying to balance how much to sell goods from your ports with how much you need others to pay to buy them with waging war to seize critical shipments.  This a quality game, and one I hope to play many times.  I may bump this to a 9 with more plays.

I enjoy this game through the early and middle turns, but it falls apart at the end for me. Not having any 'future' to consider, players make wild last-turn attacks that they would never consider if the game were going to continue another turn or two, and those attacks have a huge impact on the outcome.

Here's why this game is bad:  the only way to win is to expertly calculate how to bring goods back to your ports most efficiently.  This alone stretches the game out longer than it should.  Plus, to concentrate on shipping one must avoid combat, which gives any player interested in winning an incentive to encourage all other players to play group solitaire.  Once you start doing well, your income increases dramatically - you can buy more ships, to generate more income, etc.  After a few turns, the players in last place realize their positions, and are left with only one option, besides waiting 2 hours for the game to end:  to send out the pirate ships.  Sound exciting?  It's not, because the strategy doesn't work unless you have dollars to keep building ships and set them out after the first launch - your target will see you coming, and will have enough money to either neutralize you or destroy your victorious fleet with a counterstrike.  At best, you waste your resources to bring down the leader so the second-best min-maxer at the table can win.

It is - especially during the first game - a very confusing experience. It always is, but this game has too much to keep in mind with too much stuff that is important early on. If in a game  I can't remember what kind of upgrades an opponent has in a tech tree for example, that's bad, but it's nothing in comparison to keeping track of whether opponent A has Material A through D anywhere in his "realm". I'm not sure on this one yet. It definitely feels like a game that's improving once you get the hang of it. I just don't feel like playing it again.

By the way: awful choice of colors for the goods   
-------------------------------------------
Ha, came here to rate it, because I have totally forgotten I already played this. Unfortunately this game didn't improve. Rather it seems very outdated. On the plus-side I tend to like games that incorporate both trade and conflict. However, a situation occured where I could have basically eliminated an opponent in the second round of the game. I don't mind player elimination, but here it doesn't belong. You don't encounter these kind of design mistakes too often in recent games.

Interesting game focused on naval supremacy. Seems to be a good mix of naval warfare and economic management.

I suspect this game might be fun if everybody had about the same level of experience with the game. But the formula of "long game' + 'games that reward the person in the lead' + 'inexperienced players playing experienced players' is a deadly combination not to be repeated. I can't fault someone for playing their best strategy but it did make for a miserable experience. At one point I remember thinking "Okay, there's no way to come back from here, nothing I do will really make a difference..., I wonder how many hours it will be until this is over."

This game has been in my collection for years, and it still holds a firm position in my top ten of all-time favourites. Even though it's from 1996, its gameplay and components don't feel the slightest bit outdated in 2010. It's a shame that it takes 4 hours to play and requires 4 players to be enjoyable, so it doesn't get played as much as it should. Still, the game might not be for everybody, as the end game can get quite aggressive and it is not always easy to recover from inefficient planning during the opening rounds. Personally, I love the tension and drama of the endgame and don't see how it could benefit from any modifications to the rules at all. Except perhaps that combat should not be possible during the very first turn (losing a vessel is quite a setback at this point).

Medieval trading and naval warfare.  Strategy boardgame.

I have not played this a lot - but I like the look of it.  Unfortunately, my partner hates it and as a result it is never played whenever she is around.  There's plenty of decision making to do and tons of player interaction.  Towards the end of the game, there can also be a bit of a bloodbath as less succesful players try to dismantle the empire of the current leader.

Elfenroads meets Risk.
One play, 3 hours, 6 rounds. Five rounds of shipping around cubes, strange take-it-or-leave-it commerce, last round killing frenzy where victory was stolen from the veteran player and the richest player won. Risk-influenced logistical game, and lasting way too long. In essence this might be a ok game, but needs redesign and 2 hours should suffice.

Another remark: the boats look like supertankers and tend to fall over or loose cargo.

I think the end game kamikazi feature is not too much of a problem but can be fixed by variants so is not a problem. hopefully game play isn&#039;t over 2 hours or mark will go down a further step. reminds me of a oceanic die handler with fighting to boot! 250103 first game with 4. after reading the rules to everyone the game took 3 hours to play! too lengthy. doubtful whether this will come on the table often if it takes that long. people were always referring to the reference sheet to see what phase we were on. too much to consider what is happening onboard. second game session still took over two hours. enjoyment factor was indeed better as we all new the rules and had a strategy we wanted to employ. unfortunately, this game i was the venetian, and again, my game plan was wrong. **next time** i&#039;ll do much better! ;-)) sign of a good game!
following game was more battling and piracy, great game. love it. went up a rating. will always play. 5 games on and I&#039;ve managed my first win! If you are thinking about buying this game I highly recommend it!

Broken like the dreams of a roadflattened armadillo.

Depending on the prevailing warmongering attitudes, a player can get eliminated on the FIRST TURN.  Our one and only game was eleven minutes long because we immediately turned on each other until only one ship remained.  That person won.

Hoo boy.  Glad I didn't pay for that one.

I played this many years ago. My rating of 5 shows I did not like it much but my memory of it now is positive so I guess I need to play again. The new 2012 edition may help.

I really enjoyed my one play of Serenissima. I didn't win, by a long shot, but I made sure to stir the pot when I realized I wasn't going to. :) My dad liked this so much that I gave it to him for Christmas. I sure hope he gets it on the table.

Now this is a gem I think... really like it. A few reservations with the combat and end game... and the ultimate problem for me... to long. We also tried it 2-player - so I think I would like to go at it with 3 or 4... but again... LONG. Artwork and bits are great - important for me.

So far the biggest box on my shelf. I see some small blotches (food?) here and there, and the box corners are a bit threadbare, but over all acceptable　status. Beautiful box front.

this was one of my early purchases back when I started collecting in the mid 90's, the mechanics still work, but it's showing it's age to newer games that do similar things, but it does still feel different enough to keep and play all these years later...(update: getting new version)

The first time I played this, I was overwhelmed with the gaming goodness in the box. The second time, I got frustrated by having my opponents beat up on me mercilessly. The third time, I think it struck the perfect balance. It's a solid, but not spectacular game, with the need to balance offensive power with defensive mercantile pursuits--a very clever game.

This is a very fun, competitive trading and raiding game. It's a bit on the long side though, otherwise it'd get a higher rating.

Interesting trading/combat game.  Not for the clumsy (the sailors end up all over the damn place).  We tend to kill each other way more than the makers intended us to.

Generally a good game but the end game can bit a little long

A nice little trade game. A bit boring though especially once the good ports have been claimed. Not sure how the combat system fits in this game, though. It feels infinitely better to focus on moving around instead of wasting turns to slow down your opponents. Initial placement has always made me a bit dubious too.

Very good game, good mechanics and splendid material. Only point is that the battle system is not so obvious and realistic but the atmosfere is really unique !

nice game between naval battles and naval trading. It's more a family game that a wargame, but works.

At first, this looks like just another pick up and deliver.  However, the game becomes bloodier as the game progresses and players fight over control of ports.  Furthermore, there is more strategy to delivering goods than just making money - you can prevent that port from building galleys and forts in the future if it does not end up with the right mix of trade goods.

Iritating situaation when two or even three players attack one (me) beside that game is really a joy!

Fabulously balanced buy-and-sell-trade-goods-earn-money-nautical-battle game, only downside is play length (at least 4 hrs ) and the fact that planning the ideal route is frustrating as other players are there to screw it up for you.

Exceptional! It is a pleasure to be played and for the eyes, with a lot of ships travelling through the Mediterranean Sea!

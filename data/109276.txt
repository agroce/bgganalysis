Like all of these heavy euros, I need to play it solo before I can appreciate it. By the time we were done playing, I finally got the hang of it and started to like it a little bit. I did not learn it under ideal conditions and so the rating suffered. Seeing it in the same bracket as Sherwood Forest makes me sad. This game is definitely worth another chance and under the right conditions could become a favorite.

I misinterpreted a goal symbol which meant I spent the first half of the game chasing the wrong thing. I'd try it again, but the game felt more like work than fun. First impression was that this is too convoluted than it needs to be.

RATING: 9
Rich single-worker placement game with lots to think about. Satisfying short and long term decisions to be made. Seems like it has strong variety as you're very much driven by the meeting objectives which will be different each game. Nice tension between getting meeting room seats and doing enough to score with them - definitely has that crucial Euro can't-quite-do-everything feel. And feels nicely thematic too.

So far the Friendly Sandra variant seems to pull you towards lots of training a bit too strongly because there's huge points to be gained from having a lot of shifts banked. I like to shoot for upgrading the same part a lot and claiming cars to match those designs, and think this will be stronger in the Mean Sandra version. 

My only real negative is that the setup is quite painful, so a pretty minor one. Yes it's hard to teach, but any game with such interwoven mechanics will be.

Brilliant deep, thematic gamer's game about manufacturing cars by the philosophy of kanban. 

At it's the core the game is a worker placement game but with only one worker, with the goal of scoring the most points by games end (which is long but can be variable in length).  There are 5 different departments each with two placements (the first spot acts first, the second spot gets more shifts), each of which makes thematic sense, and these departments are triggered left to right so timing/rhythm is very important in this game.

The not removing workers at the end of the game and the extra neutral worker is a very clever mechanic which really sets this apart from normal worker placement. I'm slightly worried on strategic variety but I'm still enjoying playing.

heavier game to play. very very enjoyable. expect to be at the table awhile between setup, playing, and teardown. this is one of my favorite games. if you enjoy games like Le Havre, Keyflower, Panamax, then I think you should try this game. I would also suggest you play a few times before buying for your group. it is easier then it looks as you get a few plays in.  I also suggest going to the forums and getting a player guide to help with setup, actions, and scoring as I still mess those up once in a while :)

Very interesting euro.  I like the worker placement element and how it drives choices.  (Ha ha!  PUN!  Get it?!??)  There's a lot to do but the paths are directional and, while you have choices, they are both open and constrained enough to be interesting.

For me, it falls apart a bit with the unnecessary complexity of the engine.  There are complex bits tacked on where they need not be.  This is not an elegant game.  Good: yes.  Streamlined: not even remotely.  If the topmost layer of complexity were sheared off, I feel like this would become a *MUCH* better game.

Good, but not amazing.  I will play it again.

By the way, only play with Evil Sandra.  Nice Sandra is for carebear wimps - not even worth trying.

RATING: N/A
Looks far more complex than it actually is. Very clever use of synergy of mechanisms to score points. Takes possibly too long to explain but can be played reasonably quick when everyone has a grasp. I love the idea of being trapped in the factory from hell, working 12 hour shifts for a boss that hates you and never being allowed to leave!

RATING: 5
1st play: Building cars is a fun theme, and a car factory is a fun theme. Kanban is too complex for it's own good.  The connections between actions and how the contribute to your overall goal is not clear and this becomes an exercise in tactical actions instead of an over-all strategy game.  Perhaps with multiple plays it would end up in strategic territory, but given that all 4 of us were doing the same general strategy, I think that once you figure out how this game runs, there isn't much left.

2nd play: After 2 plays I understood how the system fit together a little better but it's not my cup of tea.  The game is more complex than it needs to be and the upgrading of parts, while mechanically sound (ha!) is still disjointed from the main game, and detracts from the overall "Make Cars" goal of the rest of the game.  There's a lot of pieces in this game which could be shaved off.  I don't feel like I'm playing WITH the other players at the table.  The production is good.

A nicely designed and themed game. Lots of components and things to consider when taking your turn, which can make some things hard to keep track of. It's nice to have the option of playing Sandra as nice and mean. Game play can take quite long, but it's a fun game, plus who doesn't like to manufacture cars, improve their design, test them around the track, and then boast about all of your hard work?

In terms of design, Kanban is a masterpiece. One player, one worker. Still, tons of depth. 

But, is it fun? No, not really. Too much effort to go through the rules (I almost quit at a certain point). Too much effort to memorise all the little exceptions, bonuses, tiles, rewards, and whatnot. Too much effort to try to decipher what seems to be the busiest board in the industry. Too much rules just for the sake of more rules.

The learning curve is way too steep. Even though i'd really want to, i can't give it more than a 6.

Kanban provides a warm and enjoyable "complex euro" gaming experience with lots of moving parts and ways to score victory points.  

Some innovative and interesting design touches include: an interesting "one worker" worker placement track which worked quite well in our game; a moving manager (Sandra) that scores certain areas each turn depending upon collective worker placements, which was fun; "reserve actions" which can be spent, which pleasingly reminded me slightly of the "extra power" mechanic in Terra Mystica; and an interesting way of handling collective and individual goals through a sequential "chairs" or voting system.  Shades of Die Macher?  Clearly, Kanban provides plenty of interlocking and interesting things to think about for advanced euro gamers.

Is Kanban easy to teach to first time players?  Not really.  Are you going to solve Kanban after one play?  Nope.  Is Kanban fiddly, like, for example, Brass?  Yes.  Does the end game scoring in Kanban approach "epic point salad" proportions, reminiscent somewhat of Castles of Burgundy and Dominant Species (two very good games by the way)?  Yep.  But bottom line:  for experienced euro gamers, Kanban is a well-designed, thematically strong game, and with "good Sandra" as your company manager (I spent a lot of time trying to "please Sandra"...hmmm), a fun euro gaming experience.   December 2014.

Going to raise Kanban to a 9.  My favorite Lacerda design, it is a euro classic.  October 2016.

A functional and interesting game, but as with some of Vital's other designs it's quite a lot to wrap your head around at first. Not to say it's impossible, but the business of the board itself and the wealth of nuances could prove an obstacle. Automania scratches the same itch but is more accessible, but if you've got a crowd down for heavier Euros then this one will get a warm response.

The game feels like a carefully calibrated clockwork machine - you put in input here, and feeds out over there. You take the product of the tweak over there and feed it into another input, and something else comes out the other side. Finding the rhythm and tempo to turn here and there, and to work out how much - it's an elegant knife edge dance. This is a truly crafted experience, with depth and complexity. Seriously impressive.

Overall, a gamer's game with a wonderful production quality. The game has numerous mechanics intertwining with each other that somehow feel cohesive and thematic at the same time. For instance, the game has two game-ending clocks that introduce unique scoring elements and keep the game tense/fresh. Furthermore, the existence of Sandra creates a real interesting puzzle as players attempt to manipulate their decisions to benefit from her judgement. Overall, it simply works and manages to be quite strategic and different each game.

Getting our mind round the rules took just over two hours and we still managed to get the seating allocation incorrect.  The board initially looked too busy, almost like wall paper, but once it was seeded with all the game bits it came to life and the functionality very good, as was the quality of the graphics - even if it took me most of the game to realise the various car parts were colour coded to the cubes.

Kanban is a very impressive design.  The way that the supervisor interacted with the players, initiating the scoring in different sections was very clever.  The car promotion mechanism was interesting. The ability to store turns through the time and ledger tiles was satisfying.  I can imagine that there are several ways to victory.  I stumbled upon mine – going third (of three) I did not want to start by taking seemingly sub-optimal two action turns so I started using three action turns to promote my markers up each of the departmental scoring tracks.  This proved influential as the game progressed and I won most of the supervisor scoring opportunities and achieved ultimately a comfortable win.  I suspect there would be more competition in the departmental tracks next time.  But as one player said, that as a car manufacturing game, it did not seem right that the player who gave manufacturing the least priority should be the clear winner.  It was this same mechanism that I was least fond of, as it often felt frustrating to be denied one of the two departmental slots, even though there were fall back positions in the board room.

There is a large amount of information to focus on and with slow players the game can be very slow.  With three players it took five hours.  So seven in total.  The game was absorbing throughout, but it was too long to want to repeat frequently.  Recommended to anyone seeking a challenging, rewarding and occasionally frustrating game.  Would probably appeal to Terra Mystica fans.

Same issues as with Russian Railroads. Too many interconnected parts for there to be a strategic focus. Scoring ramps up similarly as well. The worker placement mechanic is novel, but ultimately doesn't bring anything interesting to the table. It's a variant on RR's scaled action spaces, which itself was a variant on Agricola's, etc.

The graphic design is godawful, making learning the game way more difficult than it needs to be. But even a clean interface couldn't salvage what little of interest is here.

Only rated this high because there seem to be some interesting collusive elements.

First Play: Very fortunate to have the rules explained to me. There is still a mountain to climb. It took me a long time to get to grips with how the sectors wire up but the turn order and phasing is very clever. Needs the first game to be written off as a learning experience but very good.

Another game that will shine with experienced players but limp slightly if new comers are in the mix.

Send Play: Rating raised to 8.5. A very deep and clever game.

A worker-placement game that's heavy and crunchy but still has a fair amount of player interaction and decent theme. The Sandra mechanic is clever for both taking up a space as well as a visual marker on mid-game scoring rounds. The big meetings where you score more points have a very interesting system where you're trying to complete public goals but then also completing personal secret goals. Some of the rules/mechanics aren't terribly thematic or make much sense but I suppose that's fine. Overall a great game and one I'd happily play again.

Wow, just wow. Can't get this game out of my head. Like other Vital's, many connected parts, all working together. Nice thematic touches, especially with the Kanban cards. The movement/activation mechanics, and the choices they create are brilliant. Manipulating Sandra is almost on par with controlling DEFCON in Twilight Struggle.

If games are gifts, like I believe they are, then Vital Lacerda is my new Santa. He just keeps getting better, and that is both terrifying and exhilarating.

RATING: 6
This game has a loot going on, but very little engine building and is almost a pure economic game. Thus for me it feels like the game doesn't evolve but rather a sequence of actions you do to optimize. You fight for majorities in different areas, play trick taking for in meetings and set collect on cars and their parts and this among other things add for your scoring. You manage all this by trying to position yourself to get most actions/shifts. I havent played vinos but c02 and this game has a similar feel, you get little bit invested in the game but not as much as in caverna or terra mystica or through the ages (mostly do to those game has a stronger engine building). This game feels like Madeira and CO2. If you like economic games this could be something for you. In this game it feels like everyone is going after the same strategy since you have to do little bit of everything to not get penalized.

This games action selection has the similar feel to Last Will where you bid on how much you can do each turn.

This game blew my mind and is by some margin my top game. I marvel at how the board, which can look intimidating at first, is home to an entire car plant, from designing cars, to maunfacturing them, to testing them. Oh, and you are constantly under watch from your supervisor, with frequent trips to the board room, where you will need to demonstrate what an asset you are to the company.

One thing that really shines is how everything hangs together. Each type of car has a process from start to finish that ties the various worker placement spots together beautifully.

Our first game took an absolute age as I made the mistake of not having read the manual in advance. I recommend, watch Rahdo's playthrough first (which I did), and then read the manual next. Don't learn it on the fly unless you have provisions!

After the first play, it all made sense and second play was so much quicker. It is really not that complex once you have a first play under your belt.

If you like thinky Euros and you have not yet tried a Vital Lacerda game, you have to try one and see what you make of it. This guy is on fire.

I knew little about this game until a day or two before I played it for the first time with four players. It's a longer Euro with a significant amount of planning and some fun, thematic elements. In my one play, I frittered away a significant lead heading into the final week, but that didn't affect my appreciation of the game. I expect I will have more opportunities to play Kanban and I will take those opportunities.

Second play went well with four of us finishing within 10 points of one another.  I like this game and I've rated it an 8.  I think it has potential for a 9, but I'm not sure about that yet which is why I've rated it where I have.

Whilst not as unpleasant to play as all that, Kanban was still some way away from enjoyable. It has all the unnecessary complexity of something like Die Macher, with none of the elegance. Ironically for a game named after a process of giving simple visual cues, the board seems to be deliberately illustrated to make the (fairly simple) flow as difficult to follow as possible. To add to that, the pieces and setup are very fiddly and the rules ill-written and full of gaps. I lost count of the times we missed a bonus or had to backtrack over something which had gone wrong because of the lack of clarity of the rules or the board - despite the fact than none of us were exactly new to all this. I am sure it gets easier to follow with repeated plays but why put the effort in when much deeper games exist that reward you on the first play?

Long story short I would much prefer Rosenberg if I am after heavy, or Feld if I am after many-ways-to-score-points.

The rules were tough and set up took a bit but once we managed to get all that straight, the game was smooth (even if our play wasn't).  We really didn't know how the points would end up and what we really should be doing so a second play, soon, will make our game more focused.  I'm pretty certain we were doing things correctly.

Overall, I liked it.  I enjoy the theme as it different and it feels like there is a variety of way to gain points.  I'm looking forward to my next playing.

You need to try to take the following patern:
1. Grab the right projects
2. Grab the right parts
3. Assemble the right cars
4. Grab cars/upgrade the right designs

If you lose pace, go to admin to adjust your pattern. 

Regarding training, try not be last in a few departments. Adjust your certification as you go. 

Keep an eye on the meeting. Keep an eye on Sandra. Don't mind in lose a few points just to keep your pace. 

Of course this is not crave in stone, there are a lot of different strategies you may follow, but this is a good way to start and understand what you are doing.

This is like a Stefan Feld game but with a theme that works. VP galore. It feels like a lot of work went into the design. Very intricate this one.

Should play this more than once for a more accurate rating, but despite some reservations I did enjoy playing. The most prominent concerns being the length and the amount of fiddly rules. It's so hard to administrate all the little tracks and bonusses that it's easy to forget some steps. This should be mitigated with repeated plays, but how often do you get a game to the table that takes well over two hours?

Anyway, good components and easy to understand iconography. Although some players might struggle a bit linking the colored cubes to auto parts. I'm not completely sold on the visual style, but it is coherent.

I don't mind heavy Euros but seriously what were the designers thinking when they made this? Mindless, complex and unintuitive just for the sake of it. The board is farcical to look at and after a few turns looks as if someone threw a giant box of smarties onto it. I don't think I have ever seen a busier confusing board. Its a great concept to design a game like this but I feel a rework is in order to make this more appealing. Only die hard propellor heads would get any satisfaction out of this. Cannot be recommended in its current state.

Great game, but the board is a bit too crowded for my taste. It's quite a heavy euro, with not much of an economic engine, more of a quest for VP scoring optimization. I wish the rules were easier to explain too. After 3 plays I downgraded it from 9 to 8.

Whoa, this one was a beast for me to learn. I liked Vinhos, loved CO2, but hit a wall when my husband first taught this to me. It was only after an initial practice game, followed by a learning game, that I finally felt like I had the mechanics down (which is relatively rare for me).

Once you get the rules down, though, the game is great. Each decision you make is crucially intertwined with the decisions of others, not only because you block them, and not only do you change the turn order, but you then possibly change what's available next round by directing where Sandra goes. And then there's Sandra. Oh, Sandra... Even on nice mode, she is the most stressful boss I have ever had. The race for points from Sandra actually drives most of the tension and frustration of the game, and it really makes the game shine. 

If I had any complaints, I feel like majorities in the certification tracks give far too many points at the end of the game, considering how easy they are to advance (especially in contrast to the scoring cards, which require a lot more steps to accomplish). Otherwise, it's a great game.

Heavy Euro with a them that works. You really need to understand the way the game scores as it is pretty complicated. You especially need to get your head around the difference between designs,upgraded, designs and tested designs. Also note how the game scores at the end of each week and the end of the game as you can get the rugged pulled from under you if you aren't aware of how suddenly someone can gain a heap of points apparently from no where if you don't no how they are gained. I've copied some examples here https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1671216/how-kanban-scoring-works from the forums which might help

Really great, thinky Euro about car manufacturing. I love how the way the different departments are interconnected and it actually helps understand the flow of the game. Even though you place your worker on an action space, there is a lot of planning that must be done by players to order to optimize each scoring opportunity. I love the way the communal goals are chosen each round and how each player also has a scret objective to score. A must try for players who love a heavy Euro and it definitely made me want to try more from Vital Lacerda!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.25
There is a solid game in here. The way the different departments interact is fascinating, and the 2 different timelines/scoring tracks are an interesting part of how your strategy plays out. Sometimes you'll find there is no time to do much before the next scoring phase, and timing it in your favor is part of the strategy of game. 

There is only 1 major problem I have with it: It is insane to try to teach, so I find myself only wanting to play with people that already know it

Tough call between this and Vinhos Deluxe as my favorite Lacerda game.  Both of them are truly amazing games.  I gave this one the slight nod as I enjoy the them of car/car production more.  Another brilliant game by Vital.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
As in Vinhos, I like the way the extra actions (time bank here) create endless ways to achieve goals even though there are only a few action spaces. Beyond placing your worker, you are determining how many actions to take from that area, and taking those actions limits the number you can take in the future (and can cause you to lose with points if you play Evil Sandra). There are short and long-term goals that must be balanced, and because of the order the actions are resolved, timing in the game is very tricky (specifically getting cars on the test track and then buying cars)- which is an element I always love in games. 

The rules are complex (took us about an hour to get through), and it is not as thematically coherent to me as Vinhos, so I had a little bit more trouble in my first game digesting what my goals should be and devising ways to navigate the strategy. The first game for me was completely a learning game. But I really enjoyed it - rating could change significantly with future plays. Second play was great, rating confirmed.

Heavy euro game with an auto manufacturing theme. I wasn't expecting to enjoy it, but it surprised me. Lots of decisions to make and too many combinations to contemplate properly.

Three plays, one very bad.  Second play was better, and I think I like it.  Third play, done.  I do like it.  

The board, is really, kind of a mess.  Yes, it makes sense when you play the game, but that doesn't excuse that mess.  I think 4 separate boards and a track that slays out in the middle would have worked better.

So, far, I think it has potential to be a liked game, but it is under Vinhos, and not sure where it rates with The Gallerist.  My next play will tell me a lot.

This game captures the feel of working in an automobile factory and doing your best to impress the boss and get cars produced--from design to assembly line to testing! The Sandra mechanic is especially cool. It has a lot going on in it, but it all melds together seamlessly. This is one of the best thematic heavy euros that I've played. I like it very much!

Modification after two plays: I'm raising my rating to a 10. It is well deserving! I haven't been as excited to play a game again in a long time! :-)

Before I knew how to play this game, I would look at the board while others were playing it and think, "Wow, I have zero idea what is going on there."  Then, I played it once, and I did very poorly, and I did not really grasp how to play the game effectively at all.  But I was intrigued, and I played it again, and when it clicked...wow, what a game.  I continue to learn more and more each time I play it.

Board is initially overwhelming and crowded.  It took 1 hour to go through the rules and even then it took playing through a game to see how all the mechanics flowed together.  After figuring out what each space's action get you, we didn't have to refer to the rules much since the iconography is clear. We played with mean Sandra and it really made the game interesting. I love the theme of pushing cars out the assembly line and onto the test track while trying to get ready for the weekly meetings to talk about your project or what management wants to get done.  Very enjoyable game! I would always want to play this with the only concern be having to spend a lot of time explaining to new players how to play.

Once you're partway into your first game, the board will no longer make your eyes bleed, and actually starts making sense. Really! At least, it did for me.

Lots of clever little things here, foremost among them the action selection combined with Sandra, the shift manager.

This game has inspired me to coin the term "bonus salad". "Bonus salad" games feel like point-salad games in that you get minor rewards for all manner of actions spread throughout the game... but unlike point-salad games, most of the rewards aren't points / feed back into the strategy of the game instead of only being relevant at scoring.

Oooh boy, this game has so many interlocking things that trying to describe it is a great feat itself. There are ways to get resources (plans and parts) and spend them (upgrades or assembles) but also means to be more efficient on those areas (training track). and also small short term goal that will be scored. And while the theme is about car making, it has a very good ties with the mechanics.

Great game, deep gameplay, but streamlined.  The board, however, is so hectic and upfront rules that need explaining can easily scare people off before the game even begins.

A good, heavy, meaty game that the designer just seems to have put too much emphasis on struggle and shortage. So much so that it makes the game a bit of a disappointment. I don't understand the strict limitation on design tiles and on parts cubes. Why does a shortage of parts cubes prevent players pushing more cars out into production? We had a situation where white cubes were empty from the supply. Many of them were on upgraded cars, so this required one of these cubes to produce more cars of that color to be pushed onto the assembly line. But, even if a player tried to use a Parts Token, there were no white cubes, so they couldn't do it. Sorry, have to use another part and hope you have it! Ridiculous.

The way production works is just too tedious. Plays so far have seen players focus so much on the upgrading designs at the detriment of producing cars in the garage. No one pushes cars out for fear of someone else snatching them up first. Producing cars is just too weak, having to spend both time AND parts. And then the cars are gone from the track before you get a chance to take them. Makes for a frustrating game. 

What I mean is, having one or more players in the Administration can delay you. In a game of timing, that can be pretty significant. 

Even if Administration is unoccupied, someone could go after you in the Production area and produce other cars, pushing yours off the track. So, you might say "then just go to the 2nd spot at Production, so you have the last choice on what cars are produced." Yes, but then you will not get first choice at grabbing them in the design area the following turn. 

Besides all that, it is too expensive to take more than one car and also submit a design upgrade, (especially in the first position).

Anyways, it's a nice game, and I enjoy playing it. It can just be frustrating, as I tend to like games where I have more control over my strategy and not feel so hindered by the other players' actions. 
That being said, I still enjoy the game. It's no Vinhos, but it's still pretty fun.

A very simple worker placement game with lots of interconnected actions and never enough time to do things. The setup of the game board is a bit complex with all variable goal tiles and chits that need to be setup but looks great once you're done with setup. The basic flow is to chain actions to build cars and research designs together to accomplish objectives and move up on the training track. My wife thinks she's got the game solved but so far doing an efficient set of actions has eluded me. One that I'm looking forward to exploring further.

Brought the game back out after a year and many other Lacerda games. The interlocking modules of the game does make it difficult to start teaching as one needs to know about the end of the rules before grokking the beginning of the rules. The does provide an interesting puzzle to work through in how you're going to navigate the whole of the game to earn points. Some of the scoring still requires looking at the rules to explain and relearn every time I play the game. It dropped 1/2 a rating point just based on other games on the list. I still like the game, want to play it more but it's just lacking the decision space or thematic tie in that would push it up a spot.

The different systems in the game just don't seem to gel together. Some seem disadvantageous to the first player, as they enable other systems to be used for greater advantage.

Kanban has new things to offer mainly the action selection mechanism and 2 different ways to play the game (gamers vs pussies no pun intended) that provide 2 distinct experiences each one rewarding at its one way.

Like Vinhos, the explanation can be a hard work but the game is very simple in its essence. It's rare that you run out of options and there is not much downtime between your moves. You cruise around the factory gathering projects, resources, pushing cars and bring them to your workspace, if you have actions points available invest them in the certification steps. 

Sandra works like a charm in pacing the game and sometimes you will look into her to try to delay or speed up the end of week.

The scoring in the meeting is also very interesting but could be more interesting if you weren't allowed to stall your last seat.

Not that I need it but I believe that the theme is pretty well fitted in some game logic (like the minimum stocks)

The only thing I don't like in this game is the art and the game board.

I love the idea of Kanban. I'm not sure I love the game though. It is very complex, which in and of itself is not a bad thing. The problem with complex games is they need nice clear rulebooks to allow for easy learning and a simple way to look up clarifications. The rulebook is neither. This causes us to constantly miss important rules, making me super frustrated as I tend to be the one to learn and teach the games in our group. As of this writing I've played the game six times, and never completely correctly as the rules are written. That is really frustrating and sours the game for me.

I love how thematic this one is, especially for such a heavy game. You don't have too many options and you shouldn't plan too far ahead and leave some space for opportunistic moves. (That's good for me: I don't like games where I should plan multiple turns ahead in detail. Overall strategy is fine, but I just don't have the patience to think about the best move for minutes!)
I also really like all the mechanisms in this game, even though there are many. I am still wondering if it matters a lot how you play; in all games I played so far, all players managed to get a similar amount of points.

Kanban is another brilliant and different game from one of my favorite designers (though Vinhos is still my all-time favorite of Vital’s). In a hobby more and more dominated by solitairish euros, here you play the other players. 

The main attraction here is how much the other players matter. The wonderful left-to-right worker placement/activation system means you need to think ahead a turn (or two) for player moves as well as the NPC, Sandra. There are only 2 spots for each of the 5 departments. You have to move on from your current department bearing in mind that the departments and spaces within will activate from left to right each turn. The game player piece, Sandra, will move each turn as well and offers ways to get VPs/avoid penalties depending on which mode you’re playing in.

So, you need to look around and assess where you think other players will move before moving your piece. Do you want to go first in the next round? Then place as leftmost as possible. Or perhaps you want people to get out of your way before you take your next turn; then place to the right of them. You make these considerations within the exigencies of the action flow, namely: get designs and/or car parts, get cars on the track, pick up cars from the track and/or improve the features of the designs of cars you’ve picked up. 

What works for me with Vital’s games is that he’s not afraid to allow room for creativity by the players. On paper it sounds like a great idea to make a tight game as possible, but in practice, you can make a game so tight that it drives down the creativity of what the player might do if you’d just let her. Don’t get me wrong, this is a tight game, but you can use extra book and cube chits as free actions to get what you need and then use your action points for something else for a big move. You can position yourself to get the Sandra benefit passively on a turn. You can time your actions such that you pick up bonus actions (book and cube chits) along the way. This is a game that lets you Do Stuff. It's about the players, not the mechanisms. I find the decision space absolutely delightful as a result. I found similar space for creativity in Vinhos and CO2.

Update: What I wrote above still stands in an absolute sense, but in a relative sense, I got tired of the 45 minute explanation on this one (try as I might, it just takes that long). I had a similar problem with CO2 in that I’d spend a long time explaining these games, and then my plays were mostly spent answering questions and coaching other players rather than luxuriating in my decisions. I just don’t have the energy for that anymore, so I sold both games off. Happy to play someone else’s copy but as much as I respect Vital’s designs, they’re often too much work for me and my crew. 

While Vinhos is still a favorite, I’m happy to see a streamlined Vinhos and CO2 and plan on getting both.

RATING: 7
Played a prototype, very challenging actions and timing with a non-player piece that moves at a pace depending on the players action selection, and then moves in initiative order with the players.

Very promising on my first play, but I did have a hard time anticipating the end or planning for the final scoring...there seems to be very little incentive to spend shifts to get to the top of the progress tracks first as the point bonus seems wasted against saving for other uses and scoring opportunities.

Overall I really liked the variety of different systems in each department, and I look forward to the entire game getting tighter as feedback is processed.

This game has a lot of moving parts, like Vinhos, the other Lacerda design I've played, but it feels more cohesive to me in that the various action options feel like they belong in the game together.  I'd cheerfully play again (even if it weren't for the fact that my wife won handily in our first game.)

A few too many moving parts for my taste.  Individual actions are indeed pretty simple once you get the hang of them, so the game flows reasonably well if you have a clear idea of what you want to accomplish.  It's frustrating when somebody calls a meeting one turn earlier than you'd expected and you get caught unprepared, although that's extremely thematic!

One of those games which your really have to play more then just a couple of time to grasp all the interconnection and REALLY start to know what you are doing there.
Problem is: if you don't play it frequently it's likely that you have to go through the rules all over again before each play. (1 downgrade due to this)

I cannot really say why but I liked Vinhos quite a bit more (and can still recall the rules everytime I play it:-).

Kanban is my favorite Vital Lacerda game.  I love the way it all comes together.  The actions of the stations can be isolated to a very simple set of instructions, but all of those separate actions come together in an interesting way.  The payoff you get once you have a grasp on the flow of the game puts this one at a 10 for me.

Though, the board is a bit busy and clumsy to work around.  Initial rules can be exhausting, and I've seen many who never have that breakthrough moment where all of the pieces fall into place.

Thoroughly playable, but would have liked it anyway.  Although it's worker placement - with only 1 worker - you get plenty of chances to spoil the opposition's apparent strategy if you can bear to suffer the cost to yourself.

KANBAN bildet Autofabrik auf eine Weise ab, in der die diversen, spielmechanischen Verfizzelungen des Vital Lacerda mit dem Thema perfekt zu einem homogenen Ganzen verschmelzen. Wenn man VINHOS und CO2 als mehr oder minder gelungene Annäherungen des Versuch betrachten darf, ein Thema an der Linie zur Verlorenheit und Überforderung in einem Brettspiel detailliert auszuwalzen, so ist KANBAN die liebevolle Diplomarbeit. Darüber hinaus ist KANBAN Qualitätsbewusstsein auch in der äußeren Form bishin zur vorbildlichen Regel. Carsten Reuter vom Schwerkraft Verlag hat ein komplexes Spiel vorbildlich ins Deutsche adaptiert und ein kleines Universum Autowelt auf den Spieltisch gebracht, das aufgrund seiner Detailselbstverliebtheit manchen Rohling und Überblick-Neurotiker nerven wird.

I kept reading review after review about how HEAVY this game is. I had to try it since I'm the type to take up challenges. Well, I ordered it, and paged through the rulebook, which is pretty terrible. It's a convoluted mess that fails to really teach on its own. Luckily, Rahdo has a video (1.5 hrs) going through the general actions. His video was also a bit scatterbrained. Between the two I had a fair inkling of how it played though.

The game itself feels to me like a collection of 5-6 "mini games." Each minigame interacts with what winds up being available during upcoming turns. It has a very sandbox feel to it, and doesn't really represent "work" the way it may come off.
It has an extraordinarily busy board, probably unnecessarily so. Lots of pieces, and setup takes a long time.

It's the kind of game you whip out to impress/intimidate gamers...but I'm not sure I really have FUN playing it. It seems quite open ended, but with very few main actions that don't seem obvious to take. I don't feel the competitive rush or direct tactical pressure while playing. It's also an almost incalculable points fest, so the strategy diminishes.
"Ok...I can do this and this and this, and get this for this while this makes this happen." Because of that, it is highly unlikely you can follow what others are doing. So besides blocking spaces on the main track (ie: forcing Sandra to other departments), and perhaps moving car production along a certain path, there really isn't any interaction here. 

TLDR: Cool concept...but lacks fun-factor.

Opinion: in love with it. Innovative worker placement, place your worker, do the action later following the different factory sectors. The Boss moving around... After the explanation you can find that you have too much to do, but everything is well connected and with lot of sense. The rules are not so hard after a couple of turns (quite easy indeed).

I just don't know why I expect new Euros to be exciting anymore.  Hmm, let's see:

Pluses:
a few cute new-to-me mechanics

Minuses:
the above new mechanics were relatively minor
the major mechanics were too generic and uninteresting
too long
too point salady
too much stuff going on in general

For instance, what is the point of the woman either rewarding or punishing at each location?  What does that fiddliness add to the game experience?  If I played without that, I never once would have thought, "God, this really needs an extra layer of semi-random punishment to have to plan for."

(03/27/2015) Comment based on one aborted play.

Feature-dense playing board and tons of little bits convey an exciting sense of a brain-burning, complex, heavy game, but are unable to mask a jumbled, busy collection of trivial game mechanisms.

It has many more moving pieces and claptrap than Bora Bora, but in the end, players are relegated to simply moving their worker left or right along a ten-space action corridor connected to five different departments. Within each department, players may have between two to four actions picking new car designs, micromanaging, picking up parts, producing cars, and testing cars. However, the players never get into the groove of making cars, but instead busily spend most of their time racing up training tracks in order to get points. In our first (and probably last) game, we were unable to get even a single car out onto the racetrack! We never got to a meeting, calling the game after the pace car moved around one short of the checker flag space because we were bored.

It is like a hamster stuck in a spinning wheel, moving from one department to another, doing little bits and pieces here and there, gathering up designs, picking up parts, putting the parts in cars, and upgrading cars, rinsing and repeating in a linear fashion. All these rapid-fire actions give a sense of self-inflated "busy-ness", but there's nothing under the covers--busy alone does not make a good game. Further, there are no clever combos or sequence of actions that give any sense of satisfaction. After an hour, it became clear to the group that the main action spaces represent a dreary cycle of boring, simple actions that are strung together to give the impression of theme. The actions seem to tie with their respective game mechanisms, but they are dry and soulless--I am merely pushing cubes. Why am I doing this? What is the point of all this? I never bought into the simulation of making cars, because the mechanisms never allowed me to make an emotional investment into the game and the car making world. The players that did well were the ones spending the most time training and not making cars! What is the deal with that?

Surely we were not playing it correctly and making many newbie mistakes, because in hindsight, all of us should have been focusing on moving up the training tracks and getting certified. However, it was apparent to all of us that the payoff (whatever that was, because we no longer cared) is not worth the hassle that this game represents. The group was disappointed and frustrated that it had wasted an entire gaming evening in trying to learn and play this over-produced, over-hyped "hotness". To be frank, this game pissed me off as well as the others. I don't see myself ever playing this again. It is a "3".

(06/23/2015) Comment based on two aborted plays.

The designer was kind enough to send me a GM to ask if we were playing the car production rules correctly, and we were not. The correct rules allow players to produce a car with a single resource, which means more cars being pushed out of the factory, supposedly meaning more fun and interesting play. We played with the correct rules the next evening since our first aborted attempt, setting a time limit to play up to the first conference meeting and checking before continuing. We played through our first conference meeting, but unanimously agreed to abort at just over an hour, due to a lack of fun and interest. The main criticisms of the game continued to be as listed above, but can be boiled down to this: many "micro turns" of trivial actions, with uninteresting payoffs. The inevitable comparisons to other games with micro turns were made, such as Trajan, Antike, and Princes of Machu Picchu. However, it was generally agreed that there were better and more interesting payoffs in those games. The Feld "point salad" games all give varying degrees of payoff in terms of short-term VP versus long-term VP generations, but whatever the payoff, it is immediately discernible. The Gerdts' designs, through the Rondel mechanism, facilitate quick micro turns, but sometimes result in satisfying payoffs due to interesting combinations, which does not seem to be present in Kanban. The focus seems to be around collecting "conference chairs", in order to buy more scoring opportunities during the conference meetings, concentrating all the combos there. That is, the interesting play seems to be confined to only that portion of the game. 

The choices of action spaces available to a player are minimal, at two or three spaces at best, since most of the best action spaces are still covered up by the other players. Again, the payoff for any action space is minimal, especially in a 4-player game. Surprisingly, the conference meeting, where players qualify for public objectives, was the most interesting part of the game. However, the group agreed that there were too many trivial actions needed to get to this payoff, so it was not worth the effort. A player from the group went on to play a complete game or two later on with other groups, and went on to win, or at least do very well in those games by racing up the certification track, leaving the production of cars to the others. Their conclusion was unchanged--this is not a fun game. All in all, this is a seemingly complex game, but is actually nothing more than a collection of trivial mechanisms, lathered over with a generous helping of chrome. Due to its immense popularity, there must be a meaningful game in there to be found, but our group lacks the patience (and is unwilling to make the corresponding time investment) to sift through the chaff to find the wheat. The meaningfulness and intrigue of a game should be apparent within the first few turns, even if it is complex, but this game is too opaque for our tastes. It is still a "3".

Shooting straight up to the top of my list after only one play because it is exactly what I am looking for in this type of game! It is medium to heavy and it took a little over 2 hours but it didn't feel like it and, in the end, we were standing up as we finished our last round and scored. A lot of actions to do but very focused due to the goals. A lot of random elements that add variety but easily mitigated so that the luck factor is all but eliminated. Excellent design and a very exciting game!

Certainly one of the heaviest games of 2014! People will call it "worker placement," but what you are really selecting isn't an action but a group of actions, among which you can take whichever action you want.

Between getting the parts, getting the cars, pursuing your pet projects, preparing for meetings, and buttering up your boss, there's a ton going on here, in exactly the right way. (1 play)

A surprisingly challenging worker placement considering that you only have one worker and 5 places to go.  The turn cycles can be very speedy with 4 players making it impossible to meet many demands.  Multiple point paths gives some variety.  Sandra is a real bitch in mean mode.  Game does play quite long with a fair bit of down time for players (AP can be bad, although limited choices reduce this) and blocking spaces can be aggravating.  Very busy board.  Needs to see some real play before I can fully make up my mind on this, but seems excellent.

Wow...  Arbitrary and forced mechanics to the extreme.
First part of the game is especially disappointing.  It feels like a wild race (on tracks) more than anything else (esp. the building of something).  Racing instead of creating - that's not the recipe for a good economic eurogame.

Overcomplication and zillion of variables kill all the fun.

Totally not my type of a game.

Don't be misled by the title – the game has nothing to do with the real-life Kanban...

Really fun game. In particular I really enjoy the planning required and the multi step process of getting cars or upgrades. And I like all the different ways to sort of get multiple things done with one action, where you can do whatever you needed to do and then also maybe bank some time or get some other free action later, and appropriately using these bonuses is important. Also the need to collect chairs and work toward the quest cards while testing and upgrading cars pulls you enough in different directions to keep things interesting. Also I really don't understand why people act like this is some crazy complex beast. It, like Vinhos from the same designer, is actually pretty easy to learn in spite of having a lot going on.

On the plus side, it seems to be mechanically sound. On the other hand, it's overly complicated to a ridiculous degree, it's too long, has more or less no theme, and certainly no story arc (/escalation). As if that's not enough, the graphical design of the board is some of the worst I have ever seen.

The short version; much to "Feld'ian" for my tastes.

Initial Impression After One Play:

Wow, what a game! Very thematic. Every decision leads to the next in a wonderfully interlocking way. Sandra is all about messing with your plans.

Cons: Pretty fiddly to setup and what a beast to teach. I'd love to get this one to the table a lot more, but I'm scared of teaching it to new players!

Initial Rating: 7.5 (December 2014)

I have come to expect a lot from designer Vital Lacerda, gladly he doesn’t disappoint with his new game Kanban: Automotive Revolution, in a nutshell, l really like the game.

Kanban explanation can be around the 30 minute mark (but the game flows easily) and the playtime can exceed the 3 hour mark, however I enjoy every minute of it so I don’t mind the long playtime. On the other hand I do mind the downtime so I think Kanban can be best with 3 players or with 4 fast players. 

Kanban is a complex Euro game with lots and lots of hard/interesting decisions (where to play my worker?, which is the best way to spend my time?, should I study or should I get parts, designs, etc.). In particular it is great how the factory manager (Sandra) wanders and reward/punish the players, it can be hard to predict where she will land next as you have to predict other players moves, I love it. I have only played with a nice factory manager, I can´t wait to play it with a mean one. Seats are also very important and they can be very hard to get before the next scoring phase :devil:, lots of tension here.

After the setup, the luck factor is minimal. The art and game components are top notch. I don’t really like the theme (it doesn’t do anything for me), but it integrates very well with the game mechanisms. 

Bottom line, Kanban offers a lot to consider as it has lots of moving parts that interconnect with each other, I love it. It is a must have for me. I want to play again soon and I expect its rating will improve with more plays. Great euro game. I’m pretty sure it will make my geeklist of top games of 2014. I think Kanban is Vital Lacerda´s best game to date, but all his games have been great.

As it turned out, the friend who explained the game to me made around 21 mistakes :D, 2 of them very critical. In fact Vital himself corrected me in one of the pictures I uploaded from the game. Played with the correct set of rules, Kanban is even better than I initially thought and it plays also a lot faster. 

I don’t have anything more to say, Kanban is a brainburner eurogame with lots of hard decisions and tension. I love it.

As of early 2016, I would call Kanban Vital Lacerda's best game.  Subtle timing plays are possible, not all the obvious good actions are as good as they seem, and it isn't always clear whether to pursue short-term or long-term goals.

I'm only hesitant to bump this to a 10 rating because I don't feel like I grasp the game beyond broad heuristics (be prepared for the meetings, know whether you want 2 or 3 meetings, cars in the garage are a good thing if they can be acquired efficiently).

Very involved and yet once you understand why you're doing what you're doing it all makes sense.  Very tight, almost impossible to keep track of everything and maximize everything while still reacting to the changing environment (Sandra, the random draw of parts cards/goal cards/upgrade tiles, etc).  Downside is I imagine this gets very overwhelming with more than 2p and like most Lacerda games, the learning curve is steep.

I really like the thematic ties in this game.  It can be played with two in one hour if both players know what they are doing.  Very simple things to do on your turn.  What is brain burning is trying to plan for the next five moves.

PS: Did I say this was a pain in the ass to teach if you haven't played it in awhile.  I had played it around 10 times and then taught the game to two new people and wow there are so many moving parts that it was difficult not to refer to the manual and teaching in such a way that everything makes sense.  Even thought I read through the instructions it didn't really help.  Next time I am going to do a one round play through to make sure I can teach the game.

After 6 plays I'm bumping my rating up to 9 (from 8). The game is impressively deep and rewarding of clever play. The pacing of the game is left in large part to the players and manipulating/anticipating this aspect of the game is challenging and fun! 

Kanban is full of intricate planning. Smart play hinges on both strategic and tactical considerations not the least of which is maintaining tempo. There are lots of things to consider, including what other players are going to do with their actions!

RATING: 7
Kanban is a typical „What’s your Game“-product although not released by this publisher. Many mechanisms are intertwined, accordingly the effort to master the rules is high and the complexity of the game restricts the target group to those heavily into gaming. In this concern, it’s directly comparable to the author’s previous game Vinhos, Madeira or Pret-a-Porter to name a game by another publisher with a similar approach to game design.

The question with this type of game is if the depth of gameplay is only a function of complexity or if there is real depth. After one play, I’m not sure but I enjoyed Kanban. Madeira is probably the closest comparison. In both games players have to prepare for intermediate scorings which provide the majority of VPs while gathering direct VPs when possible without hampering the intermediate scorings. The outstanding feature of Kanban is the assistant Sandra, basically a neutral pawn moving from one area of the board to the next, triggering an immediate scoring in this area. The challenge is balancing immediate scorings with the preparation of position for later scorings.

My feeling is that there are a few should/must do’s such as saving some time for better short-term scoring, focusing on one or at most two colors in which to innovate designs and being leader in one or two of the five areas. Also, players need to take care to not fall behind too much in chairs for the board meetings at the end of each of the three rounds. Other than that, it’s tactical optimization. Gain a cheap majority, jockey for turn order at the right time, squeeze a little more efficiency out of the system, time the scorings. I don’t expect eye-opening revelations in future plays, just continuous improvement in playing the system.

In parts, Kanban lacks elegance (e.g. the odd determination of colors of cubes to put into production) but once past the initial complexity a satisfying flow should set in.

Kanban is a masterpiece of interlocking mechanisms, with the added management flair of a board meeting. That might sound sarcastic, but I'm actually serious. 

On a side note, I hated the mean Sandra version. Nice Sandra was really interesting, but mean Sandra just made everyone bank a bunch of extra time and ignore her.

When I first saw the board I laughed at how unbelievably busy it was, with so many different areas. This is definitely pushing my complexity limit, but I enjoy the challenge of making the game do what you want, which seems to be a common trait of games by this designer. The more cynical part of me thinks that he just adds mechanism upon mechanism until it almost collapses, but this is a very clever game that merits much more than the cursory attention I've given it.

This is not my type of game. I must say that I have enjoyed my one session (and fact that I have won may be part of that). However I am not eager to play it again.

Rules of this game are mess. Some example of few days would help very much.

Game also requires that all people are familiar with game and know what it is about. Playing it with new players is partly chore.

Otherwise I believe that there are too many options and so depth of game is given more by intricate influences on different actions on each other and this somehow leads to fact that people are more likely to exploit other peoples knowledge of rules more than their skill. 

Also other people in my group are not eager to play again. As there are other games we would rather play instead.

This is the first Vital game I've played. It's definitely a point salad. It's also a bit difficult to learn and takes some time to set up. Those are things that I don't care for, concerning boards games.

That being said, the theme is great and executed EXTREMELY well. That drove it home for me. The gameplay itself is very fun, quick, and streamlined once you understand it. It's another  clever take on a worker placement. I love that you can usually do multiple actions for each department you train in. It has plenty of depth, strategy, and tactical choices. I thoroughly enjoyed this game, despite its hang-ups. If the rules were a little easier to read through, it'd fefinitely get a 9.5 from me.

I've only played against myself but I really enjoyed it. I'm an Industrial Engineer and it was cool to play a game based on my occupation. It took a long time to figure out on my own (even with some run through videos), and I imagine it would take a while to teach other people. However after I figured out all the possible moves it actually seemed pretty simple when looked at as a whole, so I might be able to explain it better. I doubt this would come out to my table with regular people but I think if I was with some engineer friends they might enjoy the challenge.

Kanban is probably the most complex (rules-wise, not tactics or strategy) non-wargame boardgame I've played (out of 1100+ games). It's still playable though, assuming one of the players knows the rules super well and remembers to do all the maintenance stuff between turns. 

After you wrap your brain around it, Kanban is a surprisingly straight forward "get this stuff to get that stuff to score points" affair. The game takes a long time, but individual turns aren't long which is a big plus.

Overall the game is very well designed, has some interesting mechanisms and even manages to be thematic in an entertaining way. Unfortunately though there is one big let-down: there is no engine building to speak of and the game doesn't really develop during its play time, which in a long game means that you'll be doing the same things over and over again and this I find boring.

Overall Kanban is ok and certainly a big step forward from same designer's Vinhos.

05-14-2015 - Bought into the heavy euro hype and picked this one up on a whim.  I really like it a lot!  You're almost totally in control with very little luck factored in.  There are times in the game when you'll be blocked by someone else, a scoring round might come too soon for you to be prepared, cards might come out that don't help you, but most of these things can be at least partially mitigated in some way.  Lots of cards to choose from that you know about ahead of time, numerous places to take the actions you want, stuff like that.  Anyway, be a master of your own car production line.  Fun stuff.  8.

This is not just a worker placement game this is a complex and nicely balanced game. If I have to compare with Agricola, I would say the following: Agricola is a great game, but time to time you can have a lot of resources and the game warms up in the end. Here, you can't have large amount of resources and Sandra brings balance whenever works herself through the factory.

FIRST IMPRESSION:  If the rules were better organized, I'd likely rate this a bit higher but it was painful trying to find stuff in these rules.  However, the game play itself is rather simplistic although tying your actions together over several rounds can be challenging.  Setup can be a bit of a pain as well, but I appreciate that each game will also be a bit different based on different goals and whether one chooses nice or mean Sandra.  The game is almost Feldian in the way you score points for almost everything.  Turn order should not be ignored as going first in scoring rounds can be helpful.  As well, seats are important to acquire to increase opportunities to score.  

Best two features of the game are the turn track and how one can bank time to use for future actions and/or score points with Sandra.

The complications of this game do not bring me much. It took us as much time to have the rules (well) explained as for other people to discover and play Pandemic.

Explaining the rules by referring to the theme would probably have helped me make sense of the scoring mechanisms. Also, mentioning what is key to making points would have been useful (but I'm not sure that C. could infer this easily from the mere reading of the rules).

The design seems robust, but I vastly prefer streamlined games that are still full of possibilities (Trains, Claustrophobia, Race,…).

While I mostly got the mechanisms of the game, I did not have a clear vision of the ways to make points, on my first play.

Another euro, made by piling up levels of interlocking requirements, and mixing things together in a point salad.

Ein Worker-Placement-Spiel der Extra-Superlative ;).
Im Prinzip ist das Spiel sehr einfach, bis man die Regeln drauf hat kanns aber schonmal ne Weile dauern.
Jeder Spieler hat einen Arbeiter (sich selbst), den er am Rundenanfang in eine neue Abteilung stellt. Die Abteilungen werden, nachdem jeder neu steht, nacheinander durchgegangen und die zugehörigen Aktionen (Waren nehmen, mit Waren Autos bauen oder verbessern, Blaupausen nehmen, Fortbildung, etc. pp.).durchgeführt.
Ein neutraler Spielmarker läuft dabei ebenso durch die Abteilungen und gibt immer dem Spieler einen Bonus, der in der Abteilung am besten ist.
Ich finde das Spiel großartig. Es dauert seine Zeit und die Regeln sind komplex, aber wenn man eine Runde gespielt hat erschliessen sie sich einem doch recht schnell.

I played this last weekend.  Since then we realized we played wrong!  I will need to update my comments after a play through when it's played correctly.  My initial comments though are that it's an excellent game.  It's very similar to Vinhos, but since the theme is so different it doesn't feel like it.  If you can get your engine going (pun intended) in this game, there's a lot of points to be had.

Played this one solo twice to learn and once with 4 players (success).
and a failed attempt to play at 2. (person got scared away because of the complexity)

This game has a lot of depth and interconnections that makes it very intriguing. The theme is strong. At the core it has a very simple mechanic of placing one worker to get 2-3 action points. But there is a lot going on.

I personally would give it a higher score, but because it is so complex and really hard to get to the table because of it, I need to lower the score. 

I wish that there's a rule book like for Vlaada Chavatil's game where there is a "how to play" or "how to teach" this game so make it easier for us to learn/teach to get more players to play.

Against expectations, I liked it! Yes, it had a lot of moving parts, but they were very clear how each of them worked. The challenge wasn't in twisting a system to get the results you wanted (Madeira), but in being most efficient running through the system to meet the mid- and long-term goals.

Unlike Vinhos, Kanban felt very dynamic: designs were moving around, cards were moving around, goals are moving around, Sandra is moving around, there's a constant race for certification, and turn order, and chairs.

Probably the neatest part from a game design point of view was the actual action selection: It's a worker-placement game with just one worker, and workers stay in place until you pick them up and move them to the next location (blocking that space). And because action resolution is done left-to-right after they're all placed, it created some very interesting choices.

Worst part: The whole Sandra bonuses. Next time we have to play in the "mean" mode which will be more relevant.
Runner up worst part: The silly Kanban card to decide which parts get restocked. It felt very unnecessary.

The board did optically overload me. There is lots of small moving parts in the game mechanisms, therefore explaining this game is not an enviable task. Once the game started going, it was a good challenge, and it felt thematically well done.

Yeah... like. It is complex, opaque, but the worker placement at its heart is brilliant. I am moderately enamored but it could go either way from here.

We implemented a few streamlining hacks.
- Not bothering with lock tokens once we knew what gets unlocked.
- Doing away with shift gain markers.
- Just use red seats on player board.

Received in trade for Eldritch Horror via BGG 6/23/16.

Great replayability due to variable meeting goals, factory goals, demand goals, and blueprints.  The turns are extremely fast due to the limited amount of spaces you really have.  It's very much like Gallerist in that regard.  The different methods of scoring and variable game length further increase variation.  

The theme of engineering really speaks to me on a personal level.  The pressure to get everything done before the next meeting or weekly review is very thematic.

This ties Gallerist for my favorite game.

Very thematic euro and most scoring areas are very well intertwined with each other. Setup time and rules overhead might be a bit overwhelming at first and the cubes and locks are a bit fiddly. But the game somehow can still not be AP-inducing while providing interesting decision making every turn. The turn order track is particularly brilliant and a game on its own. The only thing that prevents an 8 rating is the 3h play time.

Okay, so after one play it seems like a good game, but not one that will be a favorite of mine.  It will fall into the vast universe of "good" games for me.  I would happily play it again, but I don't need to.

There is a bunch of ways to score points (too many?).  There just might be too much going on.

There are some interesting features: the meeting mechanic and Sandra, for example, but ultimately worker-place and point-salad games aren't my favorites.  I own a couple of each; I don't need any more. :)

Pros: the interconnectedness of the components; and the two worker places (timing vs strength) create some very interesting decisions. 

Cons: the game has too many unnecessary moving components; the rulebook makes the gameplay more complicated than it is; and (mean mood) Sandra's performance evaluation of the players isn't very interesting.

Gameplay suggestions: do not use lock chits; do not use seats of the players colour (players may spend up to 4 or 5 red seats to speak per meeting); and do not play with Sandra's rewards and penalties.

A superb WP/action selection game with great replayability, especially with 3 or 4 players.   Not for the faint-of-heart.  It's only flaw: no catch-up mechanism; if you fall too far behind in the first half to two-thirds of play, you're doomed.

Prima Spiel. Komplex aber fair. Sehr viele kleine Mechanismen die zunächst unübersichtlich scheinen aber sehr gut funktionieren und in sich logisch und daher auch eingängig sind. Ab und an muss man zwei Mal hinsehen, um bei den Farben der Spieler, Autos, Teile und Designs nicht den Überblick zu verlieren. Bei der ersten Partie raucht einem der Kopf, aber es macht auch da schon Lust auf mehr. Zum Lernen in einer zweier oder dreier Partie ideal. Zu viert kann es ganz schön eng werden.
Da spiele ich gerne nochmal mit!

The rules take much longer to go over than they should, being a Euso game.  However, despite its obtuseness the game fits together extremely well.  The board is seizure inducing, however.  How did they think such color combinations would work to the player's benefit?  Lots to consider, and nice action selection mechanic and scoring procedures as well.  We played the 'nasty' overseer version as the other seemed too easy.

"The board looks very busy, but playing a few rounds will demonstrate how straightforward the game is, with only 5 different actions you can perform ... forming a complex supply chain that players need to mentally juggle. 

There is a thematic explanation for all the elements of the game, and it further solidifies Lacerda's reputation as a designer who builts his games around a theme, rather than designing mechanics and slapping on themes after."

A real surprise hit for me. The heavy hitters of 2014 were all falling short of the hype, but this one made the cut. Really enjoyed the multiple ways to earn points but that they were all in line with a basic thematic arc. I'm having trouble explaining what I like beyond that, but it's sucked me in. Want to play this more and more.

I am, surprising to me, partial to Nice Sandra. I don't mind punishing games, but in our one play of Mean Sandra, I simply banked enough time to insulate myself from all punishments. My opponents simply followed suit and Sandra's movements were irrelevant to the rest of the game except for blocking a space. I find Nice Sandra requires more strategizing to jockey for position or hold back resources for scoring.

The choices of worker placements make sense in terms of what is necessary to make the cars.  Order of turns also works with getting cars that you want produced.  I liked it a lot but in terms of heavy games, I'd rather play Power Grid over this.  

Suffers from run away point scoring due to poor choices or lack of choices for one player in our 4 player game.  I hate that in games with point scoring.  I know that it makes me feel bad (I wasn't the one in last this time), but having tight scoring games is one of the epitomes that I think a great game should have.  So far with my one data point, this is not a great game.

Learning curve on this one is STEEP and the rulebook could be clearer (it's crammed full of tips and sidebars and comments from Sandra, and it's super easy to miss rules on your first plays) but after a few tries I find myself increasingly impressed with the game. I'm not a huge fan of worker placement games where each individual action is small and boring; but here, your worker can do a LOT of things at each workstation, like an octopus-armed cubicle worker. (A very thematic game, in other words.) Scoring conditions and occasions are boggling, and timing is actually the major issue (delaying or hastening the various scoring occasions is key). Basically, a puzzle game, which works surprisingly well at all player counts. It plays reasonably quickly once you've got the rules down, I suspect.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.3
Kanban gives the impression of a highly complex, heavyweight game, but in reality it is a vast collection of straightforward and simple options (you only have one worker to place). It is the somewhat mind-numbing number of possible options that gives you the brain-burning effect!
Overall, the game is a "point salad", as whatever you do will give you VPs of some sort. With Kanban there is a twist to the salad mechanic in that there is a very loooooooong VP pipeline of doing this to then do that....to then do that.... which will eventually get you more VPs. The end game scoring effectively doubled our scores at the point the game ended which feels far too much as it reduces the early 1 or 2 VP options to nearly worthless.
After one play I am keen to play Kanban again, but I do have concerns as to whether it is just far too fiddly to be enjoyable.
My second play of the game was a major turning point, now knowing what to do and what will happen with the scoring I thoroughly enjoyed the game, so much so that I set up the next session straight afterwards. This game is really growing on me and I am hopeful that the runtime will get within two hours!
3rd Game 150 minutes with 3 players. This game just keeps getting better!

This worker placement game is extremely tight. It does not take much to throw your strategy completely into disarray and leave you stranded in a spot not being able to do anything. The Sandra AI is probably one of my favorite things about this game. For the fairly commonplace theme they've chosen, Vital has managed to make the game quite thematic.

Oh man, I love this one.  I think the theme really oozes through in Kanban and that is my favorite part.

Having worked in a factory for several years, I understand the concept of Lean Manufacturing.  You don't want any wasted steps, every tool has its place so everyone knows where everything is, processes are simplified and factory flow is improved.  I really feel this as I'm playing Kanban.  Most every department can help most every other department and it can be tough when deciding where to go next in order to set up future moves.

I also love the business theme of getting reviewed by Sandra. It adds what would be realistic job stress and just fits in so well with the theme of the game.

Normally, I could care less about the theme as I mainly only concern myself with strategy, but with Kanban, it is just too rich for me to ignore.

The only thing I don't like is the set-up time with this game, but it goes much faster if everyone helps.

Gioco meno complesso del previsto (mi aspettavo qualcosa in stile Arkwright), in realtà una volta digerita la spiegazione il gioco scorre abbastanza lineare in maniera interessante. Bella l'interazione cattiva che gli spazi azione generano, così come la caccia ai brevetti prima degli altri. Gioco di programmazione e gestione lavoratori (lavoratore). Anche l'ambientazione, come la maggior parte dei Lacerda è parzialmente sentita. Il tabellone rimane molto incasinato a primo impatto. Insieme a The Gallerist diventa il mio preferito Lacerda.

RATING: 6
This game feels difficult to grok after a single play, let alone what one might think of its long term replayability. It's not so much too many moving parts, but the means to success seems to rely on non-thematic game-play. You're in a car factory, but the aim is not necessarily to generate cars ... you might instead be aiming to earn points by collecting blueprints and converting them into designs, or by activating the assembly line to move cars to the test track, or by acquiring cars from the test track, or by investing in car parts. Thematically, it just seems a too-hard-to-explain mess, and it makes for a wandering we're-not-playing-to-win, just-to-understand-it type of first game which is unsatisfying. There's some sense of desire to play again with experienced hands to see if the gameplay evolves into an interestingly competitive grind-out of VPs where the interlocking mechanisms shine and the decisions are delicious. Which may well be the case, and it offers that promise as the action selection mechanism is quite cool (and replay-worthy). But the other part of me sees the game-play as too much hard work and not enough "fun", and the game requiring too heavy a time investment for any potential (and uncertain) reward, and therefore wants to walk away. I'm not sure ... I might get talked into another game, and from there it could go either way.

A hell of a game!
It´s thematic, for those who like theme a lot, the mechanics are well integrated with the general theme, all the factory sectors make sense and there´s a clear connection between them. It´s also quite interactive, (though I personally don´t mind multi-solitaires). And the rules... well, It´s not an easy game, has a bit of details, so the rulebook is not the easiest one, but it´s clear enough. Personally, for those who might experience some difficulties integrating the all connection between sectors, I would advise playing a couple of turns to warm up, and all the pieces will fit in...

Vital Lacerda has been creating one original game after another. The explanations are always quite lengthy in his games, but the game play really makes up for it. You have one worker to send to one of five locations in order to spend time. You mission is to design, build and test cars. There is a lot of player interaction and a lot of ways to get points, but all take investment, so chose your path.

Excellently designed game. Definitely better on "mean Sandra mode" though it seems easy enough to bank extra shifts and not face her wrath. Maybe we would have been making more points by using those banked shifts however. 

I enjoyed this game, it definitely got my brain going, but at the end of a round, I never felt like I particularly had fun playing it. Traded for Madeira in the 21st Montreal Math Trade.

A 9 and that is only after having watched the Rahdo Run through. This is a real possibility of being my first Euro to hit the 10 mark! The Sandra mechanic as well as the boardroom is ingenious. This is everything Power Grid Factory Manager should of been like. Never has work been so interesting. A rich game with such a dry theme! 6/1/15

Update: yeah this game is the business. Plenty of depth, scales very well, components are amazing. A 9.5 as I am unsure if it will have legs in like 3 years time. All-in-all still a 9.5! 15/1/15

Update: nah this is a 10. I think about this one too much for it not to be! 13/2/16

In Kanban, players are ultimately trying to get a blueprint for a car, upgrade it with a part, then get that particular car out of the factory and onto the test track, get another another blueprint for that model of the car, and then turn in the blueprint to move that car into their garage before another player can grab it.  However, the game is so full of mini-goals along the way, from manager evaluations to meeting goal cards to end-of-week scoring that you're always juggling myriad things you need to do.  The actual gameplay reminds me a little of Shipyard, in that each turn you interact with a different room that has a different mechanic to gain particular items, all of which tie together in the end, but this game is much more complicated.  There are really a ton of things to keep track of in the game, but most of the tension comes from trying to achieve the meeting goals, as well as gaining seats at the board room table with which to claim them.  This is a big, complex game, but if you can keep track of everything you need to do, it can be a good experience.

After a handful of different Vital games, I can say that all have been so close to being good, but are often plagued by just having too much to juggle without it actually being interesting. Stephan Feld seems to be the master of the point salad which apparently is balanced on a razors edge of being fun or terribly boring/unwieldy. Vital seems to be aiming for the same goal but just missing the mark buy a small amount each time. Unfortunately that small difference seems to make the game either uninteresting (Kanban) or unwieldy (Vinhos).

I liked some of the ideas in this game and once the game was explained it was easy enough to pick up on the general strategy. The problem was nothing really seemed to ramp up and I just felt like I was spinning in place slowly collecting points but not really accomplishing anything.

The way this game was described to me before sitting down to play had me imagining putting together cars in the most efficient manner, but in reality it was just matching cubes up to different colored cars and getting chairs to grant bonuses for points. A bit disappointing in the end.

As the game developer of Kanban I'm bias but I knew this game would be great the first time I played an early prototype. 

It has been an honor to collaborate on the development of the game with Vital.

Kanban is brain burning fun game experience...where timing your actions and planning for midterm and end game scoring is critical to success.

It has all the elements I love in games. 

- Deeply interwoven mechanics which are perfectly married to the theme.
- Player influenced variable turn order
- 2 independent player influenced game clocks which drive the game end condition
- Intermediate scoring phases which are driven by the game clocks
- A game driven non-player character with two modes of play ("mean" or "nice") 
- Strategic thinking is rewarded
- Timing tension claim optimal actions.
- the game does not drag... the end is always closer than anticipated.

Haven't played this much but once you get over the confusingly busy game board, there's a well-designed game mechanic here. Game is a worker-placement but with just the one worker to place. It is enlivened by the haunting presence of Sandra, the factory manager, a NPC who works her way through the factory inspecting players' work. When Sandra is in a good mood, she rewards the player who has contributed most to a particular workstation; when she is in a bad mood, she penalises the player who has contributed the least. Just as everyone in the games world seems to be busily constructing 'Legacy' versions of established games, I am convinced that there is room for a 'Sandra' variant to be added to the vast majority of games.

Only one play so far of this oh so crunchy and delicious euro. If you’re not into heavy, fiddly, complex euro games, stay far away. If you liked Vinhos or similar games, there is a lot to look at here. I love that during the placement phase, each player has just one decision - he can place his worker in one of two spaces in a different department. Of course, some of those will be occupied, so choices are further limited. Despite the apparent heaviness of the game, I don’t think AP is too much of an issue with Kanban. There seem to be many ways to score points, but I’m not sure if there are truly multiple paths to get there or if the game is strictly rewarding efficiency. I’ll definitely have more to say after a few more plays.

I've enjoyed my first two plays.  The core gameplay is actually fairly straightforward - a combination of worker placement and action point allowance. The most interesting parts of the game for me are (1) balancing seat acquisition with achieving meeting goals and (2) manipulating the timing of meetings to maximize your rewards relative to your opponents' rewards. I found the layout of the rules fairly counterintuitive, making learning the game more difficult than it needs to be. 

Why is there no player aid?

RATING: 8
Rewards optimal execution of each turn; tactics that ensure your opponent's actions won't stop you having the correct mix of resources when you need them or deny you VPs when the assessor visits; and strategy to ensure that you are building the right things to score VPs in the meetings and the end of the game.
Plus the end of the game can arrive before you are ready if you don't pay attention to the other players' actions and interaction beyond just stealing an action space.
What more could you want from a worker placement game, apart from sheep or camels?
The only problem is the graphic design of the main board that makes this game seem much more complicated than it actually is.

This is an extremely rulesey and complicated looking game about car manufacturing. The rulebook is terrible, so this can be a hard game to learn. Once you get rolling, you realize there are only a few action options available to you, so it does click on at a smooth pace. One of the nice things about this game is that it gets the calculation right in terms of incentivizing you to take actions that will benefit other players in the future. There are two modes to play, nice boss who rewards you for doing well, or mean boss who punishes you for doing poorly. I don't know which I preferred, as both methods felt somehow flawed.

First and last play. I can't remember the last time I had such a miserable experience learning and playing a new game. There are rules on top of rules, just for the sake of more rules. There are exceptions, there are multiple little dinky scoring opportunities. But lets be frank, nothing works like kissing The bosses' Sandra's ass. Bottom line. Build up your banked time to 10 or as close to it as possible and follow Sandra, you will score multiple times at 10 points each while the others slave away like fools trying to get their diddly points.

What a colossal waste of time. Almost 1.5 hours to learn the rules, and then 3.5 of misery for play time.  I didn't want to ruin it for the others as they are completist and wanted to finish the game otherwise I would have just quit. 

I see like usual, it is getting all its votes from the usual "latest is greatest" crowd on the geek. BGG game ratings have become like American Idol, a popularity contest of the latest and greatest trend that has nothing to do with the quality or fun factor of a game lately.

Dec 2014: Straightforward point salad, one-worker worker placement game. 

Possibly the worst rule book ever. Referring people to another how-to-play site is inexcusable. 

Not a fan of Euros in general; some interesting things about this game:

* Although the six types of car parts (represented by six colours of cubes) are indistinguishable thematically (I have no idea what colour represents what part at all), the different commodities in the game fit the theme of the game very well mechanically. Shifts represent action points, car parts do act like car parts (required to build cars, of course, and serve double-duty by cleverly representing upgraded car parts), and meeting chairs represent scoring opportunities.

* Feels less linear than many Euro economic engine games. These games ussually have prefefined, fixed paths in which you follow a chain of cube/counter exchanges to finally get VPs. The mechanics in this game are more intrically linked. (Still, I think in this game there are only a few viable strategies, like most Euros. I just think that in this game, they are harder to figure out quickly.)

* I actually didn't feel like playing on an Excel spreadhseet! Although the board does look busy, it's very functional.

A sweet brain-burning heavy game. My first game left me exhausted, there was just so much to soak in. Collecting chairs to score points at meetins is essential, but overall not worth much if you can't meet the qualifiers in the other departments, which are constantly shifting due to competitions from the other players and the A.I. 

There aren't many games that leave me in total awe, but Kanban finds a perfect balance of strategy, player interaction, and just enough theme to feel the weight behind your actions. A top ten contender, for sure.

Update:
Dropped a bit in rating because of the lack of control in meeting cards. Would be better with some sort of draft.

I'm a sucker for a heavy euro that has an elegant flow.  This game is just that!  There is a lot going on here...in a good way. I was a little intimidated at first but it becomes clear very quickly.

We've always played with the "positive manager" variant.  I'm curious how the game changes with the "negative manager", but I'm slightly afraid of her wrath.  ;)

I've played this four times *updated August 2015* and I think it's already my joint favourite game, alongside Hansa Teutonica.

It's a challenging game where you have to think hard about what your opponent(s) are about to do.

As with games like Terra Mystica it's about resisting getting too sidetracked by tempting alternatives, as the flow of your 'economy' is of paramount importance.

The worker placement mechanism is fantastic and encourages you to think several turns ahead. Your thought process can be like this: "I want to go to Designs first, then Logistics, then Assembly ... however I might instead rush to Logistics first because that will block the other player and not harm me too much."

Players who like to manipulate timings/flow in games may like Kanban a lot. There are many ways to do it, each affecting who moves first in a turn, who speaks first in 'meetings' to score extra victory points, how the game ends etc.

Some goals are secret and some bonuses are hidden, but most things are visible - so decisions are often difficult and 'thinky'. It's fun, though. There's a strong sense of chain reactions, with good decisions working great and bad ones causing chaos.

Smart design decisions mean you have time to think - such as the way you see where all players have decided to move to before anyone actually activates in those areas. 

Some people complain that there's no economy 'engine building' in this game, but that's not totally true. There are various upgrades and you can chase good combinations of things on your player board etc.

The 'meeting' mechanism is good fun. It's an especially thematic part of an already thematic game.

The biggest problem with this game is that it's intimidating and initially difficult to teach. I am normally fine teaching games 'on the night' but I think with Kanban it helps a lot if players can read the rules beforehand (or watch the good Youtube videos). Also Kanban can feel very chaotic until you learn how to control the game and strategise.

It's also great fun to have to 'inhabit' the mind of your opponent a lot, which happens because you absolutely need to anticipate their future moves in some detail. After a 2-player game of this last night, I feel like I've been duelling with sabres!

RATING: 4
Kaban is a complex and convoluted heavy worker placement game. All mechanisms are very interwoven. The action selection mechanism is quite nice (you only place a single worker, but the total number of spots is very limited) and I enjoyed that part quite a bit. However, the rest is not really to my liking.

The game is a total point salad. At the end of a round ("meetings") you can influence for what you can get points. There is a bunch of difference currencies/resources and a many tracks on which you compete and get bonus points. In my opinion no mechanism is thematically integrated; there is no clear objective ("most points" is too abstract) and so the game is reduced to how to squeeze out the most points of this system of interconnected mechanisms, which is complex for its own sake. In that sense it is comparable to Lacerda's other game I know, CO2. Kanban is also similarly fiddly and needs quite some upkeep, which you may forget from time to time (scoring, increasing all markers on tracks correctly, Sandra's turn, etc.).

I miss in Kanban that you do not build anything. At the end of the game you just have a few cars in your garage (whatever this means thematically), few blueprints/designs in front of you and you advanced on a victory point track. This just is not rewarding enough for effort you have to put in.

Update 5 to 4: With every play I like this game less. I am not a  big fan of the single mechanisms (well, at least the action selection mechanism is quite unique) and the game is to me just a complex system of those mechaisms. The game also lacks direction, since it is the worst kind of point salads and you can get points for everything. When you play it after quite some time, you need long for a rules refresher. Additionally, the rulebook is quite horrible for referencing.

I loved Vinhos, but just could not get into this game. There were lots of little things to love - the worker-placement mechanism with Sandra controlling the pacing; the meetings were a blast - the most fun part of the game. But I felt that collecting the parts, blueprints, pushing cars, and updating the test track were needlessly complicated.

I really wanted to like this game.  Every time I played I just ended up getting frustrated - mostly at trying to find the applicable rule for a given department or for scoring.

[u]The Positive:[/u]
(+) [b]Interesting mechanics[/b]: I especially like the clever worker placement aspects (order of play determined by chosen action in previous turn, movement of Sandra which impacts game behaviour and game length, ...) and the way meetings play out (pet project, long term goal). This sure is a strategic game in which you have to plan at least two turns ahead in detail. Furthermore, long term goals set during meetings and a variable game length depending on player actions ensure players need to remain focussed over multiple turns. However, despite having strong strategic aspects, the game creates plenty of tactical opportunities along the way. Few games strike such a [b]wonderful balance between strategic and tactical play[/b].

(+) Interesting player-interaction. You can benefit from actions taken by your opponents (improved designs, assembly of cars, recycling, kanban orders, topics they bring forward during meetings, ...) and often you will need to carefully consider where they are or will be going for their next action in order to influence the game as a whole. This is a heavy euro-game which bursts of [b]positive and negative player-interaction[/b]: very nice!

(+) [b]Interesting gameflow[/b]: feeling of progress (training unlocks many different benefits, matching upgraded designs with correct test cars in your garages multiplies your points at the end of each week, matching tested designs with higly improved carparts is a major point generator at the end of the game, ...) - but the game also evolves very interestingly: at first assembly actions are straight forward, after some upgrades are made, things at the assembly line become very tight until more (different) upgrades of car parts have been implemented. Variability in end game conditions also keep things interesting from the first until the last minute.

(+) For the most part, the [b]theme is grounded in the mechanics[/b], which adds to the fun (having a horrible boss kick your ass can be quite fun when simulated by cardboard! - but also the notion of competing as colleages in a new team and the dynamic of meetings is really great and original!). This aids in explaining and understanding the game, but I must say that this title with very intertwined game mechanics remains a very complex challenge!

(+) The game leaves me thinking. This is not a simple game which reveals itself immediately. I'm still thinking whether it would be best to start out going for the right designs, carparts and the right cars in the garage to build and end-of-week scoring engine and corresponding meeting goals, or to invest heavily in training in order to avoid penalties by Sandra and quickly unlock additional actions. When selecting designs, should you be going for colors of your opponents, knowing they will improve upon the designs, also making your cars more valuable and ensuring those type of cars getting pushed out of the assembly line - or would you prefer going for a unique color so that those cars can get snatched away by others on the test track? Going for designs with car parts which you think others will frequently improve is also very viable. Bottom line here is: the game keeps you interested in coming back and trying new approaches. Together with a different setup for end-game-goals, factory goals and meeting objectives, [b]the replay value is very high[/b].

[u]The Negative:[/u]
(-) In my experience, getting the right type of car from the test track is very important in order to perform well in this game. Careful planning will bring you 95% of the way, but at least a little luck is also required. [i](a pretty sure way to obtain the car of your dreams is described in the 'tips' sections underneath).[/i] This absolutely is a skill based game with very little luck dependence, but unless all players have a deep understanding of the game, the actions spots taken by players are bound to be sometimes sub-optimal or strange bringing about a [b]small amount of chaos[/b] which can be frustrating if it means seeing your carefully built up plans spoiled or delayed. If this happens at a critical time, this can bring about considerable point swings. I guess this is the flip side of the coin when playing a game which such rich player interaction.

(-) Despite being generally thematically grounded which aids in understanding the game, this is a very complex game which is very [b]hard to explain to new players[/b]. I admire the thematic flavor implemented in this game, but I think it is not as intuïtive as some other complex games (like for example Vital Lacerda's first title Vinhos) which I often manage to explain to new players in such a way that they play it exactly right from the first time. I don't see this happening with Kanban and the steep learning curve is sure to put off quite some people in your gaming group from simply learning to master the game.

(-) [b]Pain to set up[/b]: so many different little tiles and tokens! Some tiles are also very unhandy, like the player seat tiles each with a different background: why oh why?! The board is very colorful and playful (I like the artwork), but it is quite daunting for new players!

[u]Conclusion:[/u]
Just like Vital Lacerda's other titles, Kanban is a deep complex game with clever intertwined mechanics and thematically grounded gameplay. The game poses a serious challenge for players who get kicked around as new co-workers in a car factory run by a vicious/kind supervisor Sandra. This factory will probably not reveal its secrets immediatly after reading the rule book or when getting the game explained - and maybe not even when playing for the first (few) time(s). Coupled with a variable set up, This seduces players to keep coming back,  adding to the big replay value of this game. However, being less intuitive compared to its predecessors CO2 and especially Vinhos, the complex nature of Kanban may repulse some players to learn or explain the game.

The mechanics in this title are absolutely solid, with a very creative and innovative take on worker placement in which players only have one worker. Player order is determined by where players place this worker. Clearly, a lot of thought has been put by the designer in the order actions are carried out, allowing for some strategic moves. An independant moving worker, Sandra, crosses the players' path, occupying worker spots and influencing game behaviour. This all boils down to a solid game engine, which challenges daring players to think ahead strategically, but spawning wonderful tactical opportunities all the way from start to finish.

[u]TIPS:[/u]
(*) Try to resist saving up shifts early in game in order to avoid penalties by Sandra: Yes, this can give peace of mind concerning Sandra-penalties, but it is often more beneficial to use those shifts to gain an early lead on training or meeting Sandra-goals.
(*) When taking design tiles, having multiple tiles of the same car color allows you take a car and improve its design, ensuring you have a 'tested design' in a single turn. This ensures points at the end of the game, is required for some meeting goals and is beneficial towards the end-of-week scorings.
(*) Also when taking design tiles: improving designs with a car part which you think will get improved multiple times can generate significant points at the end of the game. Not only car color counts, the car parts also plays an important role!
(*) Getting the right cars in your garage is important. A pretty sure way to get a car of a specific color in your garage is sacrificing 2 shifts ('action points' so you will) by going to the assembly line first, ensuring the first spot on the test track in the next turn. However, keep an eye out for an opponent with similar design tiles going to administration this round!
(*) This game has many important point generators:
-> Meetings (you will need to achieve goals and earn seats). [i]Seats can be earned by obtaining factory goals, training and the assembly line.[/i]
-> End-of-week scoring (having the right cars in your garage) [i]You will need the right carparts and design tiles[/i]
-> End of game scoring:
(a) Reaching a good spot on the different training tracks
(b) Having the right design tiles [i](matching a car in your garage and preferably improving a car part which has been improved upon multiple times, also in different types of cars)[/i]
You will have to perform reasonably well on each of those in order to emerge victoriously. When many players take test cars, meetings become more important - when Sandra moves around quickly, end-of-week scoring becomes more important.
(*) Being late on the certification track (low training) will hurt your scoring during meetings badly and will deprive you of some important upgrades on your player board.
(*) When in doubt: look at the current meeting goals on the table and in your hand. Look at the factory goals. Will another meeting still take place? Is Sandra nearing her desk triggering end-of-week scoring? Administration can be an interesting action spot if all other good options are taken.
(*) When placing a worker, think about your current and your next move: Players before you on the 'action alley' will have moved out of their current action spots leaving opportunities for you. How will Sandra move? Always think at least one turn ahead!
(*) When taking car parts, car parts which have moved up furthest on the improvement track underneath the test track are the 'hottest' parts which are often required to move the assembly line further. Always try to snatch these away, as they can be used directly or will be useful for recycling almost all of the time.
(*) In Kanban there are always multiple ways in order to obtain carparts (parts vouchers? recycling? ...), seats (factory goals, assembly, training, ...), extra actions/manuals (mainly via getting certified, but also when improving designs). Be flexible but stay focussed.

Play time: +- 40 min / player. Explaining the game to new players takes quite some time and would add a significant amount to this!

I felt like it was Reef Encounter dumbed down a bit. Not a ton of depth, but a few things to do with each thing/place. The seats part of it add a touch of more depth, but not so much it is out of range of medium gamers.
It is almost a family game, if it were not for the complex actions per each area that someone in the family would have to teach, and that is a chore for about 15 minutes of undivided attention. I like it. More of Vinhos-esque style of thinking involved.

One of the very best examples I've seen of integrating mechanics and action with the underlying theme. It's unfortunate that this game (and especially its visual impact) appears so daunting to many players at first. My take is that 95% of its design / visual cues are very, very well implemented for the already-experienced player, but somehow there's just too much for a beginner to grasp. Like many of Lacerda's games it is all about hanging in there for a few iterations until the light breaks through the clouds. But, oh, then... what a thoroughly well thought-out design. Plays quickly and smoothly once you know what you're doing.

I love complex games that require heavy thinking and this seems to fit into that wheelhouse. Also, it's highly thematic with is also a plus. However, it feels like there is almost too much going on, not with the mechanisms, but with how the game is scored. It really ends up feeling like a point salad, which knocks a few points off for me, simply because it can feel unfocused at times.

Still, the interlocking systems and depth of strategy that branch from a few seemingly simple actions is mesmerizing.

Ultimately this game represents a design style that doesn't work for me, an unfortunate turn that came out of the fork-in-the-road moment in the hobby that Feld created with titles like Trajan and Bora Bora.
Still, I think Kanban is the very best of its type, so good that I would be willing to play it under specific circumstances (everyone has already played before). The game takes way longer than the kind of games that I find fun. Way, way longer. But the compensation is that you get a very immersive, intricate and thematic experience.
This won't be compensation enough for me, but I can still see myself playing Kanban at the right table.
The very first boardgame that I ever sold. Not the last! :laugh:

Really, really bad. The problem isn't the mechanics. They work pretty well actually. It is so many other factors. The board is among the busiest I've ever seen in nearly 50 years of gaming. The number of options are crazy. The "single worker to place" argument doesn't really help that either. I wanted to like this game but it fails at being enjoyable on any level in the end.

My first Vital Lacerda game.  A worker placement with only a handful of places to slot a worker, yet every decision is very thought-provoking and can be quite difficult thanks to the many interacting systems in play here.  I love the Sandra mechanic in which an NPC worker - your "boss" at the factory" - traverses the worker slots and evaluates the players.  This is just an incredibly rich game, in theme and mechanics and the combination of the two.

Intense exercise in efficiency. I like the integrated turn order - really forces you to consider the timing of your actions. Upgrading/testing parts and cars is fun. 
Unlocking certifications felt kind of like an afterthought at times. 
The week-meeting-end scoring was a little hard to grasp and teach. How many differing scoring phases do we need? That said, this helps to encourage forward thinking and good timing.

Possibly the most complex game I´ve ever played, absolutely no player interaction except when one takes an option the other player wanted and the theme...well, it´s a car factory but it just feels like a points accumulation game, the theme being completely irrelevant.  By the same designer, Vinhos and Gallerist have a much better theme integrated in the game play in my opinion.

Like the rest of Lacerda´s games, this is probably worth a 9.  Taking out 1 point for being terribly complex (you´ll need 3 playthroughs to understand what you´re really doing and during the first game you´ll simply suffer), taking out another point for zero player interaction, and taking out another point because, well, I´ll play only if i´m in the mood of some serious maths.

My head hurts. Need to play about ten times before I'm confident I now what I'm doing. The positive side is that I'm willing to play it that many times. Need to explore further.
Update: Explored further. Gosh, it's all a bit dull really. A giant dull car factory in the pseudo layout of a car factory. Kudos to the designer for coming up with all these interlocking parts. Not a game I want to spend anymore time on though.

Kanban is just as much a game about impressing your boss as it is about resource management and action efficiency. Yes, you have to collect car parts and designs in order to upgrade vehicles and reserve models from the test track. But you also have to be aware of the goal card and aware of where the factory manager will be next.

My wife described the game best during our first play by saying "this is really busy" a few times. I didn't particularly enjoy learning the game; it felt kind of like a chore to read the rules and look up clarifications. However, the designer put together a great geeklist that answered a lot of questions, and once the game was set up and we started playing, it flowed well.

We kind of powered through the learning game and got most things correct. At some point during that first play, I wasn't really seeing much reason to keep it. Was there too much going on to really enjoy the game? Was it too much like work to be fun?

But towards the end of that first play, things started clicking for me. I saw how the different elements fit together and the various strategies that are available. I saw how the worker placement is very interactive and requires so much planning. And I saw how the game has a good, natural flow.

And just as the case with other games in the past I have really liked, I kept thinking about the game after we had finished. I'm still not completely sure how long I will like this game, but it currently has a good trajectory. Our second play was very good since we now not only know the rules, but better understand the ways to play well.

Kanban is an excellent thematic euro game. Learning the game is intimidating. During my first game, I felt like the game was incredibly heavy, but by my third game I would call it medium to medium heavy. Once you understand how all of the systems work and are connected, the game play is silky smooth and plays quickly. 

Kanban does an excellent job of providing short and long term incentives to balance. There are end game goals to give you direction at the beginning of the game, the factory goals help set priorities in what you want to accomplish first as you race to complete them before the other players, and the performance goals give you short term goals. This is one of the best optimization games I've ever played, since you need to simultaneously optimize on at least 3 different time scales.

A lot of fun.   The many different functions in the game require a bit of time to absorb but they are quite simple taken individually.   The game is easier to wrap your head around than Vinhos, which is a game I like very much.   In Vinhos, the interaction of the Wine Fair, the Experts and the Managers which generate the scoring elements are more confusing than the equivalent elements in Kanban.   After three plays of Kanban, there was no need to open the rulebook except for a reminder of what certain scoring cards provided.   The rules of the game, the procedures for each part of the Kanban factory, are readily assimilated, are intuitive and make sense.

Was looking forward to it, but think it is going to be too heavy for the others I play with to want to play.  So opened and punched, but not played sadly...at least yet.  My 9 year old saw this going in to the pile for my upcoming BGG auction and wants me to keep it.  So even though he won't be ready for that one for a while I will try to teach it and get it ready so he can at some point in the future.

A very solid game, with the automotive design theme nicely integrated into the gameplay. The game description is accurate here in that the game timers are interesting and  the flow of getting automotive parts, building cars, creating designs, and testing them is a matter of interesting timing and contention. Add to that the ability to increase your training, which is an investment in scoring points later at the expense of getting work done now, and you've got a solid, complex game with some nice mechanics.

Got part way through a game of this and people gave up. I think it would appeal to me had I kept it, but I would find it too difficult to find people to play and its' overly colourful for such a heavy game which makes teaching/keeping track of things difficult.

This is a somewhat complex game! There is a LOT going on, and the board is very very busy. It took quite some time for us to get through the rules, although none of us really "got it" until at least the first time we got through the end-of-week and the meeting scorings! It's a clever game with a production cycle suggesting that players take their actions in a specific order (R-->L on the board = get blue prints, then get parts, then build cars, then claim cars and/or upgrade cars) while the game (Sandra) evaluates/rewards players in the opposite order (her token moves L-->R). A large part of the game is figuring out the timing to maximize your rewards from Sandra, while also maintaining efficiency in your production cycle.

Now that I understand the game better, I'd love to try this one again! Hopefully before I've forgotten it all. The board, busy as it is, does lay out your options very well. But the scoring is a bit tricky, and interpreting the icons on the VP (meeting) cards is as well; I'm likely to forget that stuff if this doesn't come to the table soon!

I've played one other Vital Lacerda game and that was Vinhos.  It is clear this designer likes games of logistics.  In this game players are employees of a car manufacturing company and we apparently do everything from manufacturing parts to testing the cars on the track.

This is a worker placement game where on a players turn they decide first which of two spots in any of 5 different departments they are going to work for the round.  The spots vary in the number of "shifts" they can work in that department.  A shift is essentially an action.  There are many ways to get points through standard gameplay and there are also meetings at the end of variable turns where you can accomplish goals for more points.  One department each round is actually cut off while a manager occupies it and assesses each players accomplishments in that department thus far.

This is a very crunchy, reasonably heavy game.  I like games like that and this is no exception.  There is A LOT to consider and weigh in this game and it makes it not only a very engaging experience each time but one with a lot of variability and replayability.

The artwork is okay, it's fine just not that pretty or a style I particularly like.  To me it looks like bad Sunday paper funnies art.  Also the board is really, really busy.  About halfway through the game you know where everything is and the noise melts away but on first glance this could scare away a lot of people.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
First, the board was overwhelming and the iconography at times was not clear. I thought it was unnecessarily complicated and some mechanics seemed unintuitive. I felt like multiple plays are needed in order to fully comprehend how all the section flowed together. 

The theme was unique and how there was even a manager (Sandra) who would critique her employees (the players). I also liked the worker placement aspect of it. But these features were not enough to overcome the lack of streamlining.

When I read the rules before Essen, I said:
[q="srand"]Based on the rules, for me it is going to fire the oeuvre of Stefan Feld as poster-child for the school of design that calls on players to prepare a point salad from ingredients tediously ground out (the winner, most efficiently!) from fifteen individually dull mechanisms bolted together into a soul-crushing work simulator.[/q]
Having played it, I stand by that. That isn't to say that it's a bad game: it's an intricate efficiency puzzle that challenges players to manipulate two discrete game clocks and the scoring that happens when they tick past, based on collections of this, progress on various tracks, combinations of doodads and so on.

The interesting parts of this are the layered timing games and the fact that many actions (such as creating cars and placing Kanban orders to produce parts) may assist other players. This latter part is what I had been hoping for -- Lacerda's earlier CO2 was interesting for its incentive management aspects, where players could implicitly encourage one another through creating opportunities for conferences, building opportunities, impending global catastrophe etc. Kanban has only a minimal amount of this in that cars and upgraded design parts score for others' upgraded designs; generally speaking, the intended order of action spaces is clearly for players to work backwards from right to left, producing designs, then parts, and then cars themselves in order to obtain them in the following turn. The administration department does throw the cat amongst the pigeons, in that a well-timed visit can steal cars another player intended to purchase after production, but this is just another zero-sum timing game. 

[i]As[/i] an efficiency game, it's a perfectly fine one. The restriction in scope to timing/ordering only -- without the spatial concerns or resource contention you get in, say, Roads & Boats -- prevents it from being a top-tier game for me.

It loses another point for what seems like a deliberate attempt to add game weight by piling on [i]more[/i]. If a Feld game is juggling five balls, this one is juggling fifteen. It's is a harder problem but not a more interesting one -- a sudoku with boxes 4x4 instead of 3x3.

Kanban is one of those games that's like wading through molasses, every step weighted down by tedious considerations of a dozen tracks and goals and bonuses and who cares. Like a sudoku, it's a puzzle I enjoy while engaged in it, but afterwards I look back at a period of soulless busywork and regret the time. Rarely have I been less interested in playing a game again.

Very heavy Euro game with a lot of moving pieces. Really like the theme and most of the systems, although it feels a bit repetitive without a huge amount of variety. Also, it seems like it tries to do TOO much... there's just so many neat things going on that it doesn't delve deep into any one of them. Finally, the goals seem a bit over the place and having good turn order based on other players can give a large number of points. Either way, the game is still very good. Would just love to see some variable player powers and maybe some more variety thrown into the mix to make games feel more different.

Oh man, I love this one. I think the theme really oozes through in Kanban and that is my favorite part.

Having worked in a factory for several years, I understand the concept of Lean Manufacturing. You don't want any wasted steps, every tool has its place so everyone knows where everything is, processes are simplified and factory flow is improved. I really feel this as I'm playing Kanban. Most every department can help most every other department and it can be tough when deciding where to go next in order to set up future moves.

I also love the business theme of getting reviewed by Sandra. It adds what would be realistic job stress and just fits in so well with the theme of the game.

The only thing I don't like is the set-up time with this game, but it goes much faster if everyone helps.

Love the heck out of this game.  I believe it is my favorite Lacerda game, but I haven't enough experience with Vinhos to make a definitive decision.  This game is a bit fiddly, and it tends to intimidate people with its layout and seeming complexity, but it's really quite straightforward and lighter than most may initially expect (although it's still right smack in the middle of medium-heavy weight).  I really wish I could get it to the table more often.  I enjoy the game immensely, and it rests comfortably in my top 5 games of all time.

So far [person=12396][/person]'s track record has been pretty stellar. Both [thing=42052][/thing] and [thing=72225][/thing] are very solid, heavy designs with lots of interwoven bits. Totally up my alley.
This game board reminded me of the Vinhos board. Lots of different sectors which all look completely different and all have their own way of working internally. But they are all part of a bigger picture.
The rules are understandable, but I'm glad I had Rahdo's video to give me a better feel of the game flow, I felt like the rulebook didn't make that as clear as it could. And the base mechanism of executing the WP spots from left to right not only works great but it's fairly simple. What makes this game hard is understanding how to combine the mechanisms of the different board sectors in order to get your engine running.... and churning out points. Everything pretty much makes thematic sense, which certainly helps in digesting all of it, but I've never been an intern in a car factory, so I had no experience with gaining victory points from doing all of those actions.
This is a very involved heavy euro. If you liked Vinhos, you'll probably like this one as well. But I think this one is slightly easier to digest.
Very solid.

Kanban is clearly the follow-up of Vinhos as it offers a very similar type of game:
– An original action choice mechanism, without random.  Those actions present sub-actions with always a sub-original action choice sub-mechanism!  :-D
– A well represented theme where the player are involved from the beginning to the end of the game.
– A complexity offering a certain heaviness which can be confusing during the first games.  This complexity also brings an important depth and strategies to the game.
– A long life of the game with almost infinite variety of games.
– Unique happiness for all strategic game’s lovers who are not afraid of 90 minutes explanation of the rules.

Until Kanban, the heaviest euro I've played was Power Grid. So I was a little bit out of my element, but I was able to grasp the rules after the hour long rules explanation. Like most euros, the mechanics were well done and interesting. The best part was action selection because it's like worker placement, but you only have one worker. So after you move off a space, someone else can move on. The timing of placing workers plays a big role and led to some good strategy.

Thematically, Kanban is pretty 'meh'. You are kind of building and designing cars, but it's pretty abstract. The boss, Sandra, moves around the board and grades each player depending on how well they are doing in each area. Periodically you have meetings to show off what you have accomplished. So... it felt a lot like work. You're doing fairly mundane tasks, pushing papers, and attending meetings. I explained the game to my wife and she was totally perplexed that I would play it.

My biggest complaint has to be the components and graphic design. The colors they chose for the cubes was strange and some were hard to tell apart. The worst part was the secret goal cards, where you get points for accomplishing different tasks. Many of the tasks look similar and are hard to tell apart.

So, it has some cool mechanics, mediocre theme, and some graphics issues. Considering how rarely I play euro and the fact that I'd rather play Power Grid, Agricola, or Puerto Rico, I wouldn't be surprised if I never play this again. But I wouldn't turn it down if someone wanted to play.

Everything I want out of a meaty euro, and everything I crave from a Lacerda game. I don't know how he does it, but with just a few actions and worker placement spots explodes a game of great complexity and weighty choices. There is a lot to grind over. The whole game just feels like a well oiled machine, much like the ones you are building. And all of this weighty goodness with a theme that fits. Playing this just gives me warm fuzzies, and certainly makes me look forward to exploring more of his games.

A preliminary rating that doesn't have much chance of changing, I fear. The reason I write this is because I believe the fun you'll find in this game will be enhanced with further plays. I could see this game go to an 8. However I don't see myself playing this again any time soon. It's a monstrous effort to teach this game to a newbie (as it is difficult to teach it to yourself - hey,you try and keep in mind all those rules you just explained to your coplayers when at the same time trying to figure out how all the cogs work together. Which they most certainly do, if you know how) Vitals designs are the Zombie-Games within the BGG-database. They will eat your brains. They just don't get enough of them. It's so easy to make mistakes. Harsh mistakes! This game's theme is spot on: Efficiency! In terms of theme to theme conveyance ratio this should be the Euro game for Ameritrash lovers.

My first game was a 3p game with Dan and Ash. We played with Nice Sandra for our first game. I got most the rules right. In fact, I think I only missed one very little detail rule. So I think we had a pretty true-to-form experience. 

This game is amazing. I want to keep playing it, lots. I want to get my opponents to a point where the rules are seamless. That way we can enjoy its richness and depth. I think it's a fantastic design. I'm giving it a 9 rating initially. It could go up with more.

::UPDATE:: 12/31/2014

After my second play, I'm even more enamored. This one was with only two players, which made good for a quicker game. Scoring is a bit of a task to wrap your head around. The game-play mechanics flow quite nicely, it's just understanding why you're trying to do things. And that's all because scoring is just a bit wonky. Once you get that part of the game, it comes together very nicely.

This is a current favorite of mine. I see it possibly bumping up to a 9.5 if further plays continue to go this well.

Worker placement with just one worker is already a thing I haven't seen before. When you add in the time mechanism and the boss and her performance evaluations and top it off with a cool theme, this looks like a game I'm bound to enjoy.
The only question is if it would avoid the fate of Ground Floor - having to stay on the shelf gathering dust for eternity because of my being the only person in my group to like it.

RATING: 6
Extremely convoluted and difficult rules which demanded almost constant attention during our learning game, in which we got several things wrong. Very busy board did not help our understanding of the game. Otherwise, this is a well designed worker placement game with lots of detailed, thematic mechanisms.

Like Vinhos, this game is very intense, but probably a little lighter (Kanban very heavy and Vinhos being extremely heavy). The theme works very well and the worker placement aspect is really neat.

Kanban is a bit of a complicated game. This is apparent when you put the board on the table. This is probably the busiest board I've ever seen. It's actually a lot simpler than it looks... but that's still a fair bit of complicated. And the initial set up is a little overwhelming as well.

In Kanban, players play a new employee at a car manufacturing company. You have a single meeple and you place it in one of five departments. The worker placement spots are arrayed on a line which resolves from left to right. And after you take your turn, players will reallocate workers in that same order. There's also a manager who stodgily takes a spot in the next available department on her turn, where she'll reset the conditions in that department, and evaluate the best (or worst) trained employee and gives a bonus (or penalty).

Timing is crucial in this game, as there are only two spots in each department. The first spot to resolve doesn't allow you to do as much as the other, but can often be crucial in getting to do something before anyone else.

You'd think this game is about getting parts, designs and building cars... and to a large extent it is. But an even bigger part of the game is taking part in meetings with the manager. You have an opportunity to talk about one of the four goals management has said is important, and a compulsion to talk about (or at least introduce) a pet project. Most goals allow more than one person to talk about that project, but the more it's talked about, the less interesting it becomes (first person to trigger it can score the most points, and each subsequent person has fewer opportunities to score points for it). Which means that a large part of the game is rushing around to get "seats" at the meeting, or in gamerese a token you can use to score a goal at a meeting. Players get to speak about one goal at a time, and it moves on to the next player. So there's a competition to try and speak first, so that you can talk about goals other people might also want to score. The race to move up the "certification" track, which affects turn order at meetings, is pretty fierce.

The pacing in the game is a little odd, as there are two clocks. One which tracks weeks (when the manager gets to the end of the department track) and another to tracks meetings (which is mostly based on how many cars are made). The game ends when you get to two weeks and three meetings, or three weeks and two meetings. So figuring out when the game is going to end and/or if there will be another meeting is a little tricky.

There's a fair bit of stuff happening in the game, and the challenge is figuring out what's important and how to time it given what everyone else is likely to want to do. Despite the game being somewhat of a point salad, I still felt like I was following a real plan, trying to meet goals set by management while upgrading, testing and building cars.

I like the complexity of this game, but it did run fairly long with four players, especially as a learning game.

Game is an explosion of pieces but was engaging once everyone figured out what to do.

Still need more plays to get the game rules firm and in scoring some of the cards seemed a bit too powerful so we may have played that incorrectly.

I want to play again - not sure about my group though :-)

(Jan 2014 after 1 3p game with Angry supervisor mode) - Glad I was taught this game by a friend.   The shift worker placement area is pretty cool and seems limiting and harsh - tough decisions reminded me slightly of Egizia.   

This is a little bit VP salad but with a theme as to why you are doing things.  R&D, Upgrades, Parts, Production, etc.   The meetings are where a lot of the scoring happen.   The banked shift level of 5 to avoid scolding by the supervisor seems strange, but I can deal with it - feels like you should lose a shift if you get scolded not just maintain your shift bank.

As in many first plays I made some silly mistakes - including mixing up colors of blueprints - I took black when I really wanted blue ones.   I think black was a poor choice of car color since it looks silver on the "demand" tiles and "cards".   Minor issue.

Will play again.

Kanban is a game with a lot of moving parts.  It can be very overwhelming to new players, and it takes several turns to understand the mechanics and to understand which mechanics of the game to utilize for maximum points.
Once grasped, however, the game plays fairly quick, and personally, I find myself trying to plan 4 or 5 turns in advance.  A successful turn grabs every point, every reward and every move possible, leaving you on the brink of despair under the judgemental eye of the autonomous "Sandra" character.
A word of warning - setting up a game of Kanban easily takes a half-hour, as various tiles get placed all over the main and player boards, and tiles go under tiles and over tiles and next to tiles...  Very little of this can be pre-organized in a handmade tray.  So give yourself plenty of time to play.
I wish that the game was a bit more customizable - despite having "regular" and "expert" player boards, the variations in rewards are not only minimal, but everyone plays on the same playing field regardless of board chosen.  Similarly, the "nice" and "mean" modes of the Sandra character will provide equal opportunity for experienced players to get well ahead of their opponents.
Kanban is a great game, but it plays best when the board is surrounded by players of similar experience.

The game could use some leaning. The interaction is difficult to follow with so many separate places and phases. I need to play again to see if rating should go higher.

When Le Havre came out, it was a crazy concept to me that someone could build a deep and heavy worker placement game by giving the players only a single worker. Well, in Kanban it has happened again. You have only one decision to make every turn, but it's always a big one.

The board is an intimidating mess of artwork that makes the game seem more complicated than it is. It's hard to even see where the worker placement spots are, especially when you first set it up. After a turn or two, that clears up...but it takes an entire game or two to really understand how all of these moving parts work together.

The boardroom meetings, where each player has to give there presentation to the boss (aka claim a victory point card based on their achievements) are especially clever. You can do the easy thing and grab the card that scores you the most points... but good players will steal your thunder and present things to the boss before you can, even if they aren't ready for the presentation, leaving the boss significantly less impressed with your offering.

Like all of Vital Lacerda's games, this feels like 6 different mini-games that are all interconnected in baffling ways that are challenging to puzzle out and even more so to exploit. I think this might be a masterpiece, but I need a few more plays to see if I can get a handle on the strategy. For now, I really like it. We'll just have to wait and see if I grow to love it.

Under review.

I've had two and a half rules explanations and one third of a play through and I am just simply not excited to play this at all. Nothing invites me to play it. I don't think it's a criticism of the game, I suspect it's a fine game and fans of heavier games should certainly give it a go, but to me, it is absolutely flavourless. That's OK - again, it's not a criticism of Vital in any way, whose other games I have adored - it's just this title, perhaps its themes, perhaps its action-set, but I simply don't want to play it. I may consider selling this.

Perfectly combine 2 mechanics; worker placement which is my favourite mechanic and action point allowance which is my not-like mechanic but it is great combination. I spend 2.5 hours playing with my kids (12 and 11 years old). They love it. I love how the game has Sandra as the manager to punish or reward the players and the meeting round is so great. Great game.

I found Kanban much better than Vinhos, mainly because everything seems to make more sense (at least to me!).

Give it a shot!

A logistical control system popularized by Toyota in lean management and just-in-time inventory management of the automotive production assembly process. And, now it is a worker placement boardgame. This is too heavy for me and it is too much like work. Pleasing execs, earning business certifications, and I get plenty of time in the board room in real life to go there in a leisure pastime. BUT, this game has some cool mechanics that I appreciate. Love the puzzle to get the most work out of the least amount of time. Great tradeoff incentives for worker action spaces--do you want first pick or more work completed during a shift? Clever. I also like the Mean mood scenario where you play to NOT lose points from demerits given by the boss. Classic sigma six.

I like it better than Vinhos because it doesn't seem like you get points for every little thing in this game and the theme hangs together a little better, but the game is kind of overwrought for me.  There's a lot of process for fairly little product.  The fairly wide open set of options invites AP.  I like the meeting mechanic for scoring and I like how the game pushes things along via Sandra's movement and the pace car.  I'd play it again, but I'm unlikely to suggest it.

Just one of those games where the excess of moving parts and lack of any relative simplicity in rules don't lead to a deep/heavy game that I find enjoyable.  Much heavier econs like Brass are more in alignment with my tastes when it comes to what I feel are meaningful decisions and sense of escalation.

Edit - on further thought, may have been influenced by group was playing it with.  We'll see.

Heavy game by Vital Lacerda. Great designer that has found a great theme and has built a great euro system around it.

Quite a difficult game to explain. Partly because it has a lot of new and fresh concepts and mechanics.

Kanban is a really engaging, unique game that improves on the worker placement mechanic that many games use. I really enjoyed the theme of this game.  I don't think that I would ever turn down a game because it's just so much fun and intense. Despite this game being a heavier game, it actually has fairly simple mechanics. The scoring is deep and can be challenging at first. Sandra's movement is something that you have to always consider in your strategic plans because she can really help you or mess you up. I love how the designer offered two different versions of Sandra to play. You can play as the mean Sandra or the good mood Sandra. That really helps you to play the game in a different strategic ways depending on her mood.  I love how there isn't much randomness in this game. The thing that holds this game back for me A LITTLE is that I feel like it's very easy to see what your opponents need to do strategically and what you need to do. Other than the cards that you have in your hands that are hidden, it is really easy to see what your opponent is trying to do. The cards do help some, but I still feel like this is big enough issue to mention. It's not major because the game is so exciting to play and scratches the itch for a engaging yet heavy euro game. Another thing to mention is that this game does feel well balanced compared to some of the other heavier your games that I've read about. I do feel like the cards are well balanced so that you don't feel like you were cheated by luck of the draw that someone else had.

There are some awesome mechanisms in this game, and it plays a lot faster than its visual intricacy suggests.  I can't wait to get more intimate with it.

I feel like I need to offset the high-ratings for this game. This game can take a long time to explain and a long time to play. There is no incentive to make any cars for a long time and often the first person to make the car doesn't get to get it. I feel like I got tricked into make cars for other people. Also, the game is just very much about being on Sandra's good side, so really, this game is about sucking up to your boss and taking credit for other people's hard work. I admit that I don't always make the most strategic moves, but by god it sucks to play a game for 5 hours and end up last with your hard work credited to other players.

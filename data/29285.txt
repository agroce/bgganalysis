My first foray into OCS.  Big fan of EFS.  Now a big fan of both.  Started off with the Backhand Blow scenario and I am now heading south on the Case Blue maps toward the oil fields.   I have space to keep up four maps, so I love the 4 map scenarios with about 37 turns.   Loved OCS so much that I picked up and played Tunisia and then preordered Baltic Gap.  Most of my gaming time these days is OCS.

Massive monster game - I've space for only 4 maps and have only managed to play "the Drive for Oil" scenario - great maps, fantastic counters. I love the system. Love the period. The game appears scary by virtue of its size only. The system itself is very clean.

I used to think that the Case Blue microbadge was a joke, but then I bought this, punched it, and played it (in parts, only solitaire so far). Then the microbadge made sense in another, truer way: if one loves games like this, if one lives to play such games, then the answer to life's meaning is found here.

It is probably the best Eastern Front gaming experience I have had or can imagine having at any scale. I played this while working my way through the Glantz Stalingrad series, and it was altogether a religious experience, the culmination of years of study in various forms.

The fact that it connects with GBII is like contemplating the universe, and so this game is like staring into the face of God. In doing so, one must come to terms with the limitations of one's mortality in the finite world. There is only so much time or space for one person, or four, or eight to play on all the maps in our small, crowded lifetimes. Yet, this is what makes this, even part of it, sublime, like listening to, or watching, or both, just one scene from Wagner's Ring Cycle.

Yet, through it all, and every time I've played, I had the sense that I was watching the history of mankind unfurl below me. Like the sad, hurried lives of ants, filled with morally ambiguous Ao1/Do1 results and never enough SP. Do you control any of this? Does it matter? What does it all mean?

This all may sound grandiose, and no doubt it is. Such is Case Blue, and perhaps, too, the history it represents. I can be easily and plainly prosaic and analytical about other games, but this one -- and you will hear this, too, if you set it up and play it in any way -- deserves to be heralded by angels.

I have to admit that this game still terrifies me.  OCS is daunting and here there are a lot of very mobile troops with wide open ground to maneuver across. 

What I realize with this game is how much hand-holding goes on with most games.  In a typical game I can sit down, hear the rules, and the mechanics of the game more or less tell me what to do.  I don't really have a problem with this because it can be fun figuring out what paths the mechanics reward and which they punish.

OCS is nothing like this.  There are chits with mechanics for using them and there are victory conditions.  What is lacking is any clear understanding of how to manipulate those chits to obtain the victory objectives.  

So I realized that I have to put a lot more work into this game.  I study maps, study history, study session reports.  Study, study, study.  But you know what?  It doesn't feel like work.  It's fun before hand and even during turns that start taking a tremendous amount of time to execute, things stay engaging.  I'm not exactly sure how this works other than OCS is awesome.

It still terrifies me though.  Jim, you still get to play the Germans for a while yet.

I think the OCS series is solid, through and through, even if I am not as enamoured with it as some of my BGG kin.  You know what you are getting: a series which has withstood the test of gaming time, and publishers, and one that continues to be refined.  Case Blue covers, seriously covers, a neglected area of the Ostfront, even while treating what has been tread many a trodden time.

Oh boy. I bought this because I'm a big OCS fan and sort of a completist, and I thought it would be cool to have the opportunity to game some of the more dramatic campaigns of the war in the east.

But my god, this is a huge freaking game. Makes GBII look reasonably-sized. It's very short on scenarios that are at all practical to play. There are like two smaller ones that might work if you only have, like a week, but everying else looks freaking immense.

Would it have killed them to put in some more rationally-sized scenarios? Surely there must have been something. As much as I like OCS, Case Blue is likely to be virtual deadweight on my shelf until someone designs a few more reasonable scenarios. Like GBII, simply not enough attention was paid to the vast majority of gamers who dont have months on end to burn on these games.

Love the new fractional SP tokens.

RATING: 10
Played over the weekend (combined with part of the GBII game) at the first annual Con.tent convention in Vancouver. An absolutely unique experience. Interestingly, the unit density wasn't as overwhelming as when I played GBII at ConquestNW but the map layout dwarfs that of GBII. Every serious grognard should get to experience Case Blue, even if it's just a taste over a holiday weekend.

UPDATE: Played the Case Blue scenario. Rating unchanged. It's very tough as the German players but it's also probably a little more fun for them. I think this scenario works especially well for training several new players at once. Beginners playing as the Germans will really get a chance to exercise the system and should be quite competent by the end if they're coached. But of course, they won't win.

I'm really looking forward to the Enemy at the Gates scenario.

UPDATE: Played one of John Kisner's smaller scenarios. Fantastic. Even if you only get to play these small scenarios, Case Blue is still worth the price of admission IMO.

An exercise in futility. Too big a scope for a game. Would have prefererred more "minor" OCS games. Cannot bear the strange colour of german counters. Map graphics are out-of-date. 
BUT!!! 
 OCS is the best operational system available, and the possibility to fight in Caucasus is too much of a temtpation to be skipped. EatG needed a couner facelift. Sooooooooo. 
WELL DONE DEAN!! 
It's a pity you are not a fun of small scenarios. OCS shines even there and not everybody has the time and space to play the big beasts.

As an historical study of the Eastern Front at the operational level, the game excels.  As a game, though, it's a failure.  Totally unplayable due to size and length, which is a pity as there was a lot of good work and sound research put into this project (and every other OCS title).  Really wanted to love this game, but it will only see the tabletop if I want to do a solo study of the campaign.

This is here and it looks freaking sweet.  

I bought a house with a basement just to play this.  

The updated 4.0 OCS really cleans things up, and Case Blue is a great high counter density contrast to DAK's lower counter density.

I'd rate it a 10 if the shorter scenarios were better quality and the counter density was lower.  It just isn't as playable as Dak2.  I could solo many of the shorter Dak2 scenarios in a reasonable time.  Case Blue is more of a traditional monster, where dak was a playable monster. Both are incredible games I will always want to play, but I have to say that DAK gets a little nod over Case Blue because of the playability factor.  I wish I had a local opponent for these great games- I can feel myself getting rusty with OCS.

Wow... I played the 6 turn karkov scenario. Comming from DAK2 it was a big step up in counter density, but for me it was still excellent. The amount of different operational choices is outstanding. Taking karkov seems next to impossible, but perhaps dealing a blow to the germans or at least holding them up. Great game, I can't wait to play again.

update, I've been playing the full campaign solo, using Vassal and it is quite an effort, I think I've made a few mistakes as the germans, so I may restart and try to play a bit better.

This has got to be one of the absolute best East Front games available today.  I would note though, that Case Blue is really 2 games in 1 and I highly recommend that the most practical way to play the game is to use either the Case Blue maps or the Enemy at the Gates maps and their respective scenarios as separate endeavors.  Otherwise, this game will be too difficult for either solitaire or only 2 FTF opponents IMHO.  If you add GBII to Case Blue, I honestly don't know how it could be played in any practical format.  Please note that my '10' rating is as much a rating of the OCS system as the game itself.  I think both are fantastic!

RATING: 8
This 2007 OCS release is a big game. Covering the whole of operations in the area under the command of AGS, this game begins in October 1941 with Operation Typhoon and doesn't stop till the Germans are driven from the Caucasus. Virtually non-existent ZOC's keep the game fluid, all the while displaying the supply tethers that hindered armies of WWII. Incredible fun and what you come to expect of the OCS series of games. A rather heavy game in the most flimsiest of game boxes. Personally I don't care for HQ's acting as engineers, and find the lack of a separation in supply types (fuel/Ammo) causes more problems than one generic supply type solves. The game scale is out of sync and the maps could use a bit more effort as they are too bland and generic. A game I recommend both as an educational tool and to play just for the joy of it.

Excellent game system, but a poor simulation thanks to the low quality map (just compare it to the ESF maps), and serious deployment errors (especially for the Soviets). The map looks like it has been converted from a different scale, causing all sorts of distortions.

Just because it is a monster, doesn't mean it's high quality.

RATING: 9
OCS has been made to flow even smoother with these 4.0 rules. The air component of the game is now simple and just right. Case Blue itself may just be too big for one player per side, is it right for one to micromanage an army that large? Would you stay sane? (ok, that's a subjective question for someone playing these games!) 

It seemed to work perfectly breaking up the front with team play.

OCS on the eastern front...always a front killer for me.  From the publisher's description of the game:  "CASE BLUE is a remake of ENEMY AT THE GATES (EATG), and so much more. Its maps cover the entire area fought over by Army Group South from late 1941 to early 1943. You can play scenarios and campaigns that feature "Case Blue" in summer of 1942, the Soviet counter-offensive in late 1942 that was covered by EATG, and also separate scenarios for the drive toward the Soviet oil fields well south of Stalingrad after the Germans "turned the corner" at Rostov. Finally, its campaigns are designed to run in several mix-and-match sizes: just the 4-map area of traditional EATG, just the new 4-map area south of the EATG maps, and also rules for linking it with GUDERIAN'S BLITZKRIEG II to cover AGC and AGS for the critical 18 months of the war in Russia."

The OCS system is a major failure, but perhaps for the smaller games. I mean, I really don't like to play quartermaster, especially in a monster game! The design should take care of these nitty-gritty supply/support details. Plus the scale of the game vs the scale of the units is completely wrong: front lines are far too porous; you have enemy units running around to capture your supplies behind your LOC all the time. Not a realistic system AT ALL! Plus its a chore to play. Too bad, as I like the way the actual tactical battles were resolved.

I used to own almost ALL the OCS system games , years ago (in the 90's) I wanted to somehow make my own house rules. But I finally gave away hope and gave/sold them all, but for one.

Advice: stay way from this system. if you must try it, buy one of the smaller titles.

Nothing exceeds like excess.  As usual with OCS,enormous amounts of historical pretense not held up by the system (for example an overwrought air system but a map that omits most of the actual air bases).  Most of this theatre has been dealt with by Schettler's Winter Storm series in much more manageable and more historical form  That said, I did keep my copy for research purposes.

Good system!  I doubt I can complete any of these monsters (let alone buy one) but the system is clean and logical. I didn't constantly refer back to the rules... that was also due to a good overview by my teacher.  The logistic/supply rules are simple but can be dangerous if not watched!

The Edge of the World scenario is a nice, one map introduction to the system with low counter density and no enormously hard decisions to be made.  A pity there's only one-more one mapper and then nothing smaller than 4.  

Still I live in hope of one day playing the full CB/EatG/GBII combo!

The sheer size of this means I play it less than it deserves.  Eastern Front OCS - the Red Army surrounding the German 6th Army at Stalingrad, and its fighting withdrawal to the Volga and the Caucasas before striking back.  All on a grand scale.

Like most OCS titles, the more I play it the better it gets.

I loved the Drive for Oil (July - October 1942 in the Caucasas).

I played the Russians in the Edge of the World scenario while learning the rules. We played the first four turns in this 24-turn scenario. It took two evenings and I had a great time.

It doesn't get much better and more immersive than this.  Combine this with GBII and you get to simulate the entire East Front, south of the Leningrad fronts, from Typhoon in 1941 through to Kharkov in 1943.

Is it big?  Certainly.  Does it take forever to set up?  Yeah.  Would it take months to play?  Yeppers.  But that's what I wanted, and that's what I expected.  East Front OCS is meant for long-term mega-gaming.  Small scenarios are a bonus.

This is going to be a hard one to rate.  It has a lot going for it in the level of detail that is accomplished by not so complex rules.  However, due to the time needed to play is this really an 8 or 9 by BGG's rating?  Am I even usually willing to play this (ala a 7?)  Not really.  One needs to set aside the time and effort to play and enjoy this game.  It is a good game when one takes the plunge, but not a casual game by any means.  Therefore, I will not rate this game.

It is a good game.  Lots of things need to be considered while conducting operational moves.  And supply will be the key.  Do you have enough material to do what you want?  So while OCS itself is an excellent system, this is the ultimate in that series covering with a great mass of counters and unit density the Eastern Front.  Might not be the best place to start with OCS, but certainly a goal to strive for.

==============================

On reflection, a HUGE disappointment. Hideous maps, bland counters and a system neutered to the point that all pretence at history has flown out the window. 

The problem is not its size, it's the lack of flavour. I might be able to eat a 3 pound T-bone, but not if it tastes like cardboard. :)

Please, somebody, buy mine and put me out of my misery!!

Long set up, too much complexity.  I don't understand why this game is so highly rated.  The game takes hours to play through.  I might as well play axis and allies, as it's a superior game.

Edge of the World scenario played as USSR v Alden Greene late 2008 Damascus - Axis Supply too limiting

Drive for Oil scenario played H2H as Axis v Alden Greene Damascus 2009-2010

"It's so big!!!", she cried when he whipped it out.

- Yeah baby...

edit: lowered the grade a notch. Still an awesome game, it's just unplayable as a campaign game without some serious tweaks. But some of the scenarios are superb.

Love the game. 

For those complaining about the lack of small scenarios, try the two one-map scenarios. Edge of the World is really great. A good, supply-starved OCS-introduction like Race for Tunis. The Kharkov-scenario is unbalanced but really short and fun, with both sides attacking. Give the Russians some extra reserve markers and supply and I think it would balance out.

Drive for Oil even better but longer and pretty big (4-5 maps).

I have actually played the whole 10-mapper from July 42 to May 43 (7.8). Took two years playing one night a week with 4-6 players. Great fun, and both sides will run big complex offensives, but more efficient to just play the action-packed periods (Drive for oil, Uranus, Saturnus, Backhand blow).

Muy intenso. Sufrimiento para el ruso y probablemente desequilibrado a favor del eje. Aun asi una de las mejores experiencias de juego.

Have the opportunity to play this monster (friends are playing as I type this) combined with GB2. It looks like fun, but takes a huge commitment. This IS operational level wargaming as it should be.

Too big and long.  Games ended up being so focused on supply routes that it was boring.

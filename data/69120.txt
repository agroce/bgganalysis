RANK: 2332

RATING: 6.75
Not sure whether this was all that enjoyable or not. A little bit of press-your-luck (stay in the town or leave now!), set collection, and difficult decisions relating to how you actually use your scarce resources (actions). Not bad, but not great -- especially after only two plays. This needs more table time for further assessment of how I feel about it.

Cadwallon. Thieves check in but they don't always check out. This game operates on the premise that some dude, probably a rich one with a really bohemian sense of justice, decided to build a city that lures thieves in with promise of riches and then has a bunch of walls close and lock them in. In the game you play one of four different gangs of thieves. Each gang has three members and each member has unique strengths and weaknesses. You spend the game trying to steal sets of treasure (set collection objectives) and possibly get up the nerve to raid a particularly hard to penetrate vault. Of course you meddle with your opponents as much as possible too by using your gang and also manipulating the town constables by moving them at the beginning of each players turn. I like to refer to them as, "wandering justice". The game is driven by a action point allowance system that is pretty straight forward and the big thing to keep in mind while playing is you are meant to push your luck. At a certain point, the city begins to trigger its "roach motel" strategy and you need to race to get your thieves out of Cadwallon before they end up trapped inside. Any thieves that don't make it don't score what they stole for you during play. So it is not just about stealing sets of treasure but also about escaping with it. This quirky game has multiple scenarios with varying difficulty and objectives and I really should get it to the table more often.

The game is refreshing in that the focus is not on combat or destroying the other gangs, but instead, accumulating the most loot before time runs out. The rules are simple enough to pick up and there is a campaign for players interested enough to play more than a couple times. The artwork and components make for a visually striking game.

Con este juego tengo sentimientos encontrados. Por un lado es un juego con una mecánica sencilla, de hecho, lo que hace atractivo al juego es la posibilidad de fastidiar a los oponentes bien mediante la milicia, bien enfrentándose a ellos. 
Cojea bastante en el aspecto de que todos los personajes tienen los mismos atributos, si bien luego cada personaje tiene una habilidad especial, pero bueno, nada que no pueda arreglarse y parece que subsanaron algunas mecánicas con la expansión de El rey de las cenizas.
En cuanto a los materiales están bastante bien, con moneditas de plástico y fichitas transparentes. Las cartas también están bastante bien y el tablero no se ve mal. En este aspecto podríamos decir que el juego esta bastante bien si no fuera por las miniaturas y, la verdad es que es una lástima. En mi caso llegaron en su bolsita de plástico bastante dobladas, y cuando digo bastante es bastante. Dejando eso a un lado, ya se sabe que son azares de la vida, la calidad deja mucho que desear. Cierto que no es un juego muy caro, pero tampoco es barato, y nos encontramos con figuras mal rematadas y poco detalladas, de aspecto y tacto endeble. Sinceramente, para hacer esto tal vez habría sido mejor meter unas figuras de cartón con peanas y rebajar el precio 20 o 30 €.

Tragic example of a game with amazing components (board, detailed miniatures, and plastic money) with terrible rules.

Oversimplified to the point of boredom. Everyone has the same exact stats except for one unique ability. You also get a hand of cards that can be used to execute various additional actions and buffs.

Unfortunately its run to a room, open a chest with an action, take the treasure, run out, either fight or run away. Fighting consists of an opposing die roll without much variation or tension.

This is a game I cannot recommend unfortunately, not among Fantasy Flights best.

Beautiful game with awesome production (I bought the painted miniatures), but the game just fell flat for me. The similarity of the stats did not bother me, but the game itself was a little too dry for what it is. Defeating someone and pushing them a few spaces back appears to be mostly pointless when they could just come back the next ture.

Wanted to love this game, but it didn't meet my already lowered expectations.

As we have come to expect from Fantasy Flight the production levels and artwork are very good. This game may be a little too simple for hardened gamers to tolerate too often, but it is an appealing theme that may well attract a lot of non-gamers to have a bash at it. Will it make my top ten? Probably not, but that does not make it either a bad game or a disappointment to me either. It's a theme-rich knockabout with lovely artwork and broad appeal. That kind of game can always find a home in my collection!

RATING: 4.1
By looking at the production one imagines a brilliant game. However it is a boring, very simplistic game. There are various promising elements, e.g. the exceptional artwork, the different scenarios, the different treasures and the 2-5-8 vp set collection distribution, the different character abilities, the arcana cards e.t.c.
however 2 main gameplay issues ruin the game:
1)the city is claustrophobic and conflict is inevitable, in a way that it makes any strategy pointless. Everywhere it's almost the same thing: hit the guy who tries to get to the treasure and send him 3 blocks back. :(
2)what do I do in my round? I simply move 4 spaces, and then roll a die to see if I pushed the other guy or if I got the treasure.
Maybe I'm wrong and the game is better. However I don't think even a 14-y.o. would enjoy it.

City of Thieves is a fun game and it has gorgeous miniatures and great components. Unfortunately, this game offers the type of fun I seldom enjoy: light-hearted and not too brain-engaging! I can see myself playing it when someone suggests it and no better option is available, because it is not a terrible game, but it is very far from my ideal economic no-luck game...

Crazy underrated game that should be an AT classic.  A simplistic rule set coupled with a variety of missions help keep things interesting.  A very mean game where you're trying to get in and get out with the most money.  This is in the same class as Nexus Ops, Betrayal at House on the Hill, Monsters Menance America...classic Ameritrash.  It's not over complicated with ten convoluted subsystems each turn.  Just good ol' fashion, chucking dice and being mean.

OMG! I cannot believe how much FUN this game is! It's a very lightweight game, fast playing and perfect for a fun games night. It's not a dungeon crawler, it's not a skirmish game, it's not (exactly) an Euro worker placement game. It's such a pity this game is so criminally underrated, all because SOME people can't get over the fact that the stats for the characters are all the same, instead of focusing on the gameplay. Plus you get a campaign to play through, or just play each scenario as you like.

I bought this out of curiosity and because the artwork intriqued me. Since then we had many very fun and tense adventures in Cadvallon.
I like the game for its fast paced gameplay, the relatively short lenght, and the unbelievably great atmosphere. To me its Mordheim if you dont' have the time.
The all the same stats of the gangmembers was irritating at first but it turns out that this is a blessing because new players are not overwhelmed by too many details. Each individual has its special ability and thats totally enough to give each gang and gangmember its unique character.
It's all about tactics in this game. a grand strategy is easily made obsolete due to high randomness so you need to stay flexible with your plans if  events turn in a bad direction.
Dont' play this with easily frustrated and competitive minded players!!!
Also I'm not too happy about the quality of the material being used for the miniatures. The plastic is much too soft thus a paint job would only last for so long. Thats a shame, because the design is fantastic and my hands always start twitching towards the pencils and colours even when I think of them.

I was very MEH about this game. Seems like a lighter version of AEG's Tomb. Yes, it was quicker, but not enough depth in my opinion. Also way too random for such a short game time. 

In my opinion, I'd only play this if you think Tomb is too complex or too long. Otherwise, I'll stick with that.

Plus: Amazing bits and print quality. It's FFG after all.

A nice surprise; being a Cadwallon-RPG and Confrontation player i found City of Thieves to be lacking in the theme: it fails as an expression of the richness and variety of the world of Aarklash universe. Still the game is very very good, plays fast and it is actually fun, that's what's important, isn't it?
I rate it a 6, because if i am in the mood for some Aarklash action, i would play the rpg first, the wargame second then this...

Molt molt maco.
Semblava que hagués de tenir asimetria i no és així...
Cita d'en Salpika "Ayer pude probar el juego y me dejo con sensaciones encontradas. Es un juego divertido ( pero para ello los jugadores tienen que picarse y apuñalarse) pero sin profundidad, basicamente es tirar dados contra otros jugadores para robarles sus tesoros que para mi es el gran fallo del juego, al final se reduce a eso, a esperar el momento adecuado para dar el golpe. Aunque, depende que juego, me gusta el azar en este al ser todos los Pj iguales acentua esta caracteristica y coarta las opciones tacticas que pudiera tener.
Un juego divertido, pero sobretodo para no jugones, eso si facilmente "tuneable" para darle unpoco de chicha al juego."

Players run a guild of thieves, sending them into Cadwallon to loot the town of treasure, and to fence it for ducats (victory points).  Fun game where players take turns to spend action points to move their four miniatures through town, then do something with them - loot treasure, bust open chests, attack other characters, etc.  Nice simple mechanics allow you to concentrate on your character abilities and action cards.  Fun game if you're in the mood for a light whack-a-friend fest.  The hidden ducats, and the ability to cash in your treasures during the game (double or triple dipping) elevated this one above the more mundane games of this type (such as Tomb).  Good fun.

RATING: 8
Based on first impressions after one play, this was surprisingly good.  The ruleset is simple, and the play is more tactical than strategic. The dice rolls mean that there is some luck involved but it usually created some fun or tense moments. The board artwork is gorgeous and the different abilities of each team member are interesting. My first play was with 2 players and I thought the board would be too big and open, and that we would be able to easily avoid each other.  That wasn't the case at all, there were enough opportunities for us to block and mess with each other, and opportunities for clever or surprising plays too. Both of us felt that it would be even more fun with more players though. I'm definitely going to be upgrading to the pre-painted minis, and I'll probably upgrade the action tokens to glass beads in each team colour.

If you read a lot of my comments you'll see that I very much enjoy designs from DUST Games, but I also feel they fall just shy of being great. City of Thieves is no exception. It is a fun tactical game with lots of scenarios and options to explore. My main wish though is that there were just some slight stat variations between characters. It has German design efficiency but maintains tons of flavor and character. This is one that I keep bouncing between keeping or not, but despite things being familiar there aren't many tactical skirmish games like this so I think, at this point, it has a "keeper" label firmly placed on it now.

The friend that brought this over was worried it was far to simple before we even started to play. 

It is a very simplistic move/action game where you have 7 action chips spread over 4 gang members. Turns are very limited as you have to move before you take an action.

The box suggested it was a struggle running around the city stealing treasures and then trying to get out of the city before the guards arrived in force. In reality the treasures were all stolen before the end of turn 4 and thus we all had a turn of milling around before the alarm went off and we could 'escape' the district. And escape wasn't that difficult, with 7 alley ways not locked down there were plenty of places to escape. Nobody got caught and arrested.

We found no reason not to just guarantee your treasure by smashing open the box since lock-picking required a dice roll and there were action cards that could mess around with the outcome (bad for you). This is a shame as I think there is supposed to be one of the major aspects of the game but was completely ignored.

Combat is simple high die roll wins and the action cards vary greatly in power levels with far too many meh cards. If fact many of the cards were so bad or circumstantial they were mainly ignored. 

Gang abilities are also hugely variable and I know its supposed to be flavourful but if you are playing the yellow gang you are likely to lose as you have all the lame character abilities whereas the blue gang seems to have all the powerful breaks a rule abilities and the green gang has all the abilities that affect the cards that nobody cares about until they get the one or two good cards in the deck.  

One player also found a, (an I hesitate to use the word) break with the game. Guards only take ducats off you if you lose a fight, therefore he didn't convert any treasures into ducats at all since they all automatically convert at the end of the game if your gang member escapes therefore there was no penalty for him if he got beaten up by the guards. This showed greatly in his final scores where he had almost double the nearest rivals score.

Expansions seems to improve upon many of the factors mentioned and so I would like to give this another try.

EDIT: Apparently we played slightly wrong you do not have to move first then take and action. Also guards will put back a treasure if you have no ducats if they beat you up. Improves the game slightly.

A little bit too much luck driven: sometimes it feels like the winner is not at all the player who played best, but the one that rolled more.
A particularly serious problem in this regard is that the penalty for losing a fight is the same whether you are the defender or the attacker, therefore choosing to attack is not such an important decision.

Very nice components.  Artwork is great.  Too much die rolling for me.  Two or three bad encounters can ruin your chances.   All characters have the same attributes except for a skill.

Pretty awful game. Nice premise, nice art/feel. Horrible gameplay. No fun.

I bought the iOS version because I wasn't sure I wanted to invest so much in the actual game, and I'm glad I didn't spend more than a few bucks for this boring, mechanical experience.

Granted, the truly awful, user-unfriendly, and buggy interface of the iOS version didn't help anything...

But the game mechanics themselves are awful. It feels like you're never really even making any choices or decisions in the game. Any choices you make seem completely frivolous and unimportant. From what I can tell, there is almost (or maybe completely) zero strategy involved in the game. The main decision that makes any difference comes down to "Do I gamble on picking a lock, or make it a surefire bet but give up taking more actions?"  

That's it.  Everything else is pretty much a no-brainer mechanical move, combined with random elements of chance and chaos (arcana cards and dice rolls.)

Seems like it would save a lot of time to simply square off at a table with your friends, each of you flip a coin 20 times, and see who flips Heads the most...  Yay! You're the winner!

+1 for the cool artwork and atmosphere (definitely much better when not in iOS format, though, I'm sure.) 
-9 for everything else.

If you can internalize what it isn't (not Okko, much less Hybrid 2.0--indeed not a minis game at all) and accept it on its own terms, City of Thieves is a nice little romp. It's cutthroat, and it allows for nifty movement considerations (okay, maybe it's a bit like Okko after all!). The key appears to be realizing that your goal is to get all your guys off the board and to profit from missions.
It drags with 4, though--this game is best when kept brief.

Fast, easy, fun, and beautiful to look at.
You can play it with your family (light-hearted and easy enough for up to 4 players), you can play it with your friends (it can easily become a "take this!" roughouse)or you can play it with your spouse because it plays wonderfully with 2 players.
A rare example of easy and elegant mechanics that drive a game that is more than the sum of its parts. 
Highlights: absolutely beautiful art throughout the components (minis, board, cards, counters); tight and tense games within an hour; 8 scenario boards that expand the game in 8 different directions.
AND the most important thing: it's FUN.

This is a fun, simple game. Grab some loot and get out of the city. Did you have bad luck stealing treasure? No problem, go knock the other player's guy out and take some from them.

Got this from my (perhaps) german Secret Santa 2011!

Not as heavy as I thought. Rules are easy and it plays ok fast and is well balanced. I have only played it two-player, and I am afraid the game could have to much downtime when playing it 3-4 people? Much of the game look great, but the tokens (action point tokens and ducats) and miniatures feels very cheap.

RATING: 5.5
Based on one play.  

Love the art, most of the mechanics, and theme.  However, I found it very disappointing that the game underneath is little more than an exercise in dice rolling.  There are character and card-driven abilities which provide ways to achieve better odds on the dice (e.g, rolling an extra combat die), but our experience was that luck was still the driving factor and that strategies made possible by those abilities were still minimal at best.  This makes the game simply a very average experience at best.

Not a bad game but not one I'd likely seek out to play again. It requires players to, instead of playing proactively, to play very defensively - mostly to stab other players as hard and often as possible. As a friend who also played it said, "It's not called City of Friendship." Mission cards seem wildly overpowered - they broke our game open completely, and the objectives often felt as though the game was not adequately playtested.

This game is exactly what I wanted it to be. It has everything I have ever dreamed about in a game. Its got fighting, lots of fighting. Its got thievery. Its got awesome minis, its got variable scenarios, and plenty of room for possible expansions. The only drawback to the game is that it only plays up to four. Need more gangs, more city boards, and more scenarios in the first expansion please.

[u]Updated Comments:[/u]
I still do love this game, but some of the shine has warn off. Nothing against the game itself, its just that [gameid=155068] seems to do everything this game does, but better. Limit board, lots of player interaction, etc. But Arcadia Quest also has character development and stats that make development of characters and synergies out of your setup. And a campaign mode. 
I did get the the first expansion which added more boards, and a few different mercenaries but I was hoping for even more gangs. Like I said I still love C:CoT but, but not sure if this even necessary on my shelf any longer.

This beauty lacks in almost every possible aspect.

It didn't only bore but even annoy me; what a waste of great game components, ingame art, publishing work and generally living time of those involved, makers and players alike.

The fighting system is more than stupid, forcing all participating players to constantly and pointlessly roll dice, the board is severly overcrowded with miniatures that are, at least while unpainted, quite hard to tell apart, every turn everything changes completely and the only promising allthough well-known mechanic, the action-cards, turned out quite lame. 

This is basically a game of parchesi covered in eye-candy and »scenarios«, with additional dice rolling and flow-of-game-cluttering dice-rolling-fests and minus the fun.

Sorry if I might sound midly annoyed, this game really upsets me. Probably because it looks so good and feels so hollow.

The art, pieces and cards give the impression of a much more complex and deeper game than it is, which is somewhat disappointing.  The chr cards, for example, have stats but every chr's stats are the same.  There are numerous other things that could have been dispensed with to lighten production costs.

One supposes you could fix this with some house rules: Movement reduced to 2, dispense with mission cards, etc. but at the point where you have to change so much, why bother?

The production values are very beautiful, however.  The coins and action points give off a satisfying clink, the artwork and figurines are extremely well done.

The main criticism I tend to read about this game is it's simplicity. That is a fair point and not one that I disagree with, but I don't necessarily hold the opinion that a simple game is a bad game. If you like cool miniatures you'll probably like this game, if you like cool artwork on the boards and the skullduggery theme you'll probably like this game too. One criticism I do agree with though is that there isn't enough variety between the different characters that make up the thieves - yes, they do all have unique abilities, but a little variance in the stats would have been desirable in my opinion. Overall, a good game to pull off the shelf and spend an hour robbing and backstabbing with on any boardgaming night :-)

Our first play, including learning the rules, took 2.5 hours. That's about 90 minutes more than I would have liked, and 60 more than I think it needed (ignoring the rules-learning). That said, I did have fun the whole time, it just seemed somewhat tedious at times. For example, there were several turns where it seemed like we mainly focused on stealing back the stuff that had been stolen from us the turn before -- not so fun.

The board looks great, as do the cards and characters; the flipside is that several characters are hard to tell apart from a distance, and the spaces on the board are annoying to distinguish from one another.

Actual gameplay has some clever aspects to it, but the dice drag it down for me -- this just isn't my kind of game. I see 2.5 hours and think "I could just have played a 60- and 90-minute Euro that I love instead of this."

A second play, knowing all the rules, might raise this past a 6.

3 /5 - Good

Clever design which seems very random and, to be fair, is very random, but which offsets this by offering the players a surprisingly high number of paths to victory and I'm fairly sure that making good choices will trump the dice the majority of the time. And for those times when it doesn't, the game is short enough to be enjoyed for the excitement alone, and for its stunning visual presentation which really is top-notch stuff. Plenty of re-playability with a number of scenarios on offer which do make full use of the rules framework to create different and challenging play experiences.

Not overly impressed with this one after an introductory play or two, but I think with the right crowd it could be interesting.

So it's not really in the wheelhouse of any of the groups of people I play with.

Simple game with repetitive mechanics, limited options and too long play times for the little it does. Very pretty components and extremely charming characters and miniatures. In fact, this game was probably designed to have something going with the miniatures! 

Each player has a number of characters and a number of activations points. The player can spend activation points on making his characters move, open chests, stab other player's characters to steal their loot, and to buy cash vouchers called "mission cards" from an immaterial but omnipresent thingie. 

The game is [i]extremely[/i] dice driven, with some uninspiring cards thrown in to provide a semblance of depth. It is ameritrash to its fingertips, but the theme is rather shallow and dry. Hadn't it been for the extremely pretty figurines the theme would have been parched as a desert. 

To try to summarise the depth and style of this game, it is like the retarded offspring of Dungeon! and Cavetroll (which incidentally is also an FFG release, and I suspect an inspiration for this fast job). On the upside, there is a high degree of player interaction. On the downside, the interaction is repetitive, dull and almost utterly luck-driven. If you play it in a rather ironic sense not as much to win but more to mess with and screw over your friends then it delivers a pleasure reminiscent of the same happily meanness you got from your first games of Munchkin, albeit less of it. But just like Munchkin you very fast realise that it simply isn't fun and takes too long, and dedicate it to waste space on your shelf.

Probably younger players and teens might enjoy it. It is too long for a filler and too dull and lacking in both tactics and strategy for anyone else.

It's a lot of fun. It can be somewhat random, but there are ways to mitigate it. The minis are fantastic. Each player controls a gang of four thieves. The characters are wonderfully odd and in a four player game there's 16 of them out there whaling on each other for treasure.

A popcorn game. I greatly enjoyed the theme, the art, the components, and the conflict generated by the mechanics that allow players to attack each other.

Given this, it's a bit long for what it offers, and it appeared that all of the scenarios are essentially the same, even if they are technically attempts to add some variety: players are running around grabbing treasure and attacking each other until time runs out.

I've only played the first scenario which is pretty much move your guys in, pick up treasure lying around, and then land on other people and have a dice combat, winner steals treasure from the loser. A turn is using your 7 action points amongst your 4 characters, and each character can move once and/or do 1 action (combat or get treasure). This gives a wealth of options across your 4 characters which can result in some downtime unless people are used to the game and are intent on it moving along. Once you've picked up some treasures, you can also spend 3 action points to earn instant money from mission cards for the treasure you've collected so far (in the treasure type spec'd by the mission card that is). The fun ramps up after the official mid-way point, at which point your characters are allowed to leave the board. In fact, they must leave the board if they want to count their treasure, so numerous attempts are made to force other characters back towards the middle (they auto-retreat 3 spaces if they lose a combat, winner's choice where). Anyway, most money wins. There's lots of opportunities to attack whoever's in the lead, so its self-balancing to a degree (or king-making, call it want you want). Still, it can be some fun with the whacking and the dice rolls, and the 8 different scenarios provided offer different objectives and experiences ... so it offers some exploration if you're ok with not taking it too seriously.

Played the Zombie scenario.  Given the weakness of combat vs. characters (defender wins ties.)  This seems to have a strong first player bias.  Once a character is on a treasure good luck getting them off of it with combat.  The Zombies are pitifully weak.  Don't know if it was legit or not, but when the portcullis came down player one got to place 3 while the other 3 of us placed 2 apiece.  Player one took our game while player four lost due to a "niggling wound" card played by the last place player.  It's not a terrible game, but there's little reward here for 'good' play over luck.  Player four scored something like 5 missions while the eventual winner player 1 scored 3.

Wow I really liked this. Reminds a bit of Drakon, at first. Grab treasure and screw your neighbor. Try and mess up their plans.

Only this has *slightly* more complication. And I mean that in a good way. And I like that there aren't individualized stats. That would be too much.

Need to remember you don't cash out on the purse and other items unless you *leave* with it. Holding a card that lets you walk through another player is a really good thing to have when all other exits are blocked and there is a player in the way of the one exit you can get to.

*Also have King of Ashes exp. Duke is in main box.

A light game based on combat and theft. The game is heavy on the theme and easy on the rules so it's easy to teach to people and works well with 3-4 which is something that's helpful when getting people together to play. However this one will probably see a lot of shelf time later on down the road.

A rather quick and really easy to learn. There isn't too many options to do in game, the system is really simple. Simplifying usually makes the game more chaotic and it's also the case with this game.

I don't consider this game bad at all. No great tactics are involved, but in contrary to many other FFG's older games, this is easy to play and plays quite fast also. Really euro-gameish.

My one play was exciting, you have tension in the game, but there is not so much control and one good or bad dice roll can make a hell of a difference especially at the end when you wanna get your thieves of the board; What I find a minus about this game is that you can't choose to play defensive: the board is so small that if they wanna attack you, they will attack you.

Um, interesting, in a way.  The gangs lack any real flavor, which hurts the game, but keeps it quick.  Not sure I'dve made that choice, if I were the developer.  
The scenarios are cool, but they have the problem of being built around a fairly vanilla move-and-fight pseudo-stealth kind of thing.  
I don't know.  Maybe you'd like it.  I thought it was okay, but I'm in no rush to play it again.  Got it cheap.

(Rated from a single play with 3 players).
A light game with some good moments, but in the end repetitive and not so much fun: only the different missions offer a bit of interest and replayability. I suspect the more the players the better, because of a fiercer competition for the same treasures.
Nothing openly wrong with rules and mechanics, but my feeeling is that something is missing or not well balanced.

This is an okay game, nothing here that really excites me. It is more ore less a roll and move and die rolling game and that is what it comes down with a few exceptions thrown in here and there through cards and abilities. Not a clever game and not an innovative game but just plain and simple and worth your while if there is nothing else to do.

Review based on two plays of the 1st scenario.

There's a lot to love in City of Thieves. It's a great looking game with quality components. Excellent rulebook with very easy to teach rules. Plays with 4 players beautifully.

I only have a few worries about the game. Depending on the players, this can be viciously cutthroat. I like the level of player interaction here, but the scoring system can encourage players to pick on the guy in last place. Not a big problem, but pair that with the fact that combat relies heavily on random Arcana cards and this can spark frustration.

Overall:
The pros out-weigh the cons by a long shot. After a couple sessions players should notice patterns/develop strategies to stop runaway leaders. The game can feel busy and crowded at times, but I can only see this getting better over time. All the different scenarios and mini-expansions help tailor the game to your liking.

RATING: 5
I love Arcana. I saw this game sitting on the shelves at Gamefest South and knew I had to try it. It's based on the same RPG (one I had never played) and it's made by FFG. I figured it would be great.

The game just feel flat on it's face when it took off from the starting line and it just laid there crying. I was so disappointed.

First off, rolling dice and comparing results for a winner is not a fun battle system. It would've been so much better had they implemented a card system of some sort. Shame on FFG. They know so much better than this.

Second, the abilities on characters are pretty lame. Some are really powerful, while others could just not be there and no one would notice. Seriously, one player didn't use the power of one of his characters until the last turn because it really isn't useful. It was very useful at that point, though.

Third, the things you can do on your turn are very lackluster. Move, attack, open treasure. And there are even more rules that restrict what you can do even more.

I will say this, though. The game is absolutely drop dead fucking gorgeous. The game I played the guy bought the prepainted figures from FFG (at a hefty 60 buck sum) and they are just jaw dropping. If you love this game (and people will, it's just not for me) you really should consider purchasing these.

RATING: 7
I know folks have made a big deal about the identical stats being printed on each card. Didn't think much one way or the other really, but in a way a nice reminder without needing a player reference sheet AND then the card for the special ability.  I liked the special abilities - and that while some are available in the Arcana cards, others are not.  Different gangs have differing strengths...and need to adjust your strategy.

Played the first scenario on the first map.  Really like that there are choices and see the obvious expansion maps/scenarios down the road.  7 turns seems to be about right and the mechanic of the portcullises closing on Round 5 definitely adds a nice element.  

As the game went on some differing strategies developed.  Gang up on the cripple didn't work because I seemed to start rolling much better left-handed (broken right arm ;) ).   A good balance of gathering new and stealing others treasures was as viable as simply steal - to a certain extent.  One player went the attack and steal route but after losing a couple of times late in the game he found himself pinned in by guards and unable to get 2 of his thieves off the board.  So not only lost the treasure points but also cost him 3 points per character.  You need to look at wanting to maximize their load with being able to safely escape.

All in all an enjoyable evening.  The first scenario is perfect for learning the mechanics, the others seem poised to build upon that.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3.5
Great artwork & componets by FFG but the game itself is pointless. My group didn't even finish the game as we were all bored by turn 4.  All the characters and bad guys have the same stats.  They do have a different special ability but it's not enough to set them apart that much. Just not much of a game here.

A surprisingly fun game that reminds me of Dungeon Twister. We've found it's a great game for the casual folks because it's pretty, easy to learn and quick to get through.

I think this game is a blast!  Have played two and four player games and I have enjoyed every one.  The argument over "different stats" for each character is way overdrawn.

I'm not quite sure what to make of Cadwallon.  I think I want this game, but I'm worried that the only reason I want it is because all those plastic minis are so damn cool.  Part of my confusion arises from the fact that we were in quite a rush to learn and play through the game, and having subsequently downloaded and read through the rulebook, I see that we played rather a lot of rules wrong (including setting up the treasure chests face down instead of face up - unless the specific scenario specified that they were supposed to be that way, not giving a coin when successfully opening a chest, not using an action to perform an attack, allowing characters to perform more than 1 action per turn if they failed to successfully pick a lock - thus speeding up the first portion of the scenario and making the rest of it drag as a result, and so on).  The 4-player scenario we played was certainly chaotic and it seemed to drag on too long for what little there was to the game, yet some intangible element of the game leaves me intrigued and wanting to pick it up to play with my boys half-a-dozen years down the road.  (The new expansion and the downloadable tidbits on the FFG website certainly appear to make the game much more interesting.)  But then again, with the minis being as stylistically fun as they are, I would feel compelled to fork out the cash for the pre-painted dudes.  The other components are a mixed bag, with the board being nice and large, while the text on the cards is just the opposite - barely legible even with my reading glasses (an old pet peeve I have with FFG).  So hopefully I'll get a chance to explore the game a little more with the expansion at some point, and meanwhile I'll give it a conditional rating until such time as I can play it again.  Game design: 3/5  Personal enjoyment: 2.5/5  Total: 5.5/10

RATING: 5
Each player controls a gang of thieves out to rob the rich of Cadwallon and trade the loot for ducats (i.e. VP). Very simple game, but rich on the screwage: on your turn you can also move one of the city watch, probably to harass an opponent; your own thieves can also roll the enemy, because robbing another thief in the street is easier than prying open a locked chest.

Turns are very limited, so getting out of the city in time can be problematic (treasure is worth nothing if you don't escape). The most interesting aspect is that you can double-dip treasures by fulfilling "mission" cards that give you cash for the collection even before you've escaped -- you can still win even if no-one leaves the city. Lots of dice rolling and random draws.

In theory, the large number of included scenarios makes every game play very differently; in practice, it's like changing the colour of the curtains. The impact is noticeable but has little practical effect.

Enjoyable to play but not an experience I would seek out.

Theme-wise, not really my thing. Running around a dungeon to collect sets. I was always slightly bemused by how we had to open a safe to steal things, yet we knew precisely what was in the safe beforehand.

Too chaotic for my taste - in the sense that most of the interesting actions centered around jumping on top of an opponent with a view to steal stuff off them.

It's OK, though; I'd play it again, but won't be buying a copy.

As I played Rackham's Confrontation (2nd and 3rd edition) quite a lot and have fond memories of this time, I have a soft spot for everything set on Aarklash - even if it's just within the city walls of Cadwallon.
The game looks beautiful and is easy to learn and fast to play.
Don't expect a lot of depth and complexity, because this is not what this game is about.
It's a fun little race for treasure, with some possibilities to hinder (and annoy) the other thieves on the board.
The idea to include different scenarios each with their own specific rules is nice.

RATING: 6.5
With a couple of games under my belt, I really like CCOT because of its replayability (missions), its expandability and its simple, streamlined gameplay. The game is very interactive, up to the point where it can become a bit confrontational as one opponent after the other robs your gang of its treasures. But this mainly encourages you to score your treasures as soon as you are able. Despite the dice rolling, clever play (i.e. assessing risk/reward ratios and making the most of your action points) mostly does not go unrewarded. Maybe it is not the best game for four players, because of its increased chaos. Just do not approach this game as an old school atmospheric RPG-like adventure game, as it really is a point allocation, push-your-luck game with atmospheric artwork. Personally, I like it for that.

Awesome looking, but lacking SEVERELY in gameplay.

I LOVE the art for this game.  The theme and concept grabbed me as well.  Even reading a couple of the scenarios made it sound good.  I really wanted to like it... But your turns are essentially "move a couple of guys, roll some dice to see if good things or bad things happen to me".  Even if you avoid the dice rolling as much as possible, the other players can essentially undo your entire turn by attacking you.  No interesting mechanics,  and your decisions are largely trumped by the dice- whether it's you doing the rolling or someone else.

if you're looking for a game where the outcome is even remotely decided by intelligent decisions, look elsewhere.  this is cards, multiplied by dice, multiplied by bad player portcullis decisions, equals random fest.  but it's pretty, so if you're looking for a pretty game where you roll some dice and see what happens, this game's for you.

Pretty decent game where you try to rob a city blind.  I like it - and there are few games in the genre (heists/thievery) that are worth recommending, so this one gets the nod by default.  Don't get me wrong, it's good, I just wish there were more games in the genre.

Suffered from looking like a different kind of game with the theme. The game itself is simple clean and fun if you accept it for what it is.

Maybe I had too much expectation with this game... but it was a bit dissapointing. I believe that when they put the different characters the game will change a lot.

Excellent themed fun game for when you don't want you brain to hurt and want to get immersed in the theme.  Got revised edition and the painted figs to go with it.

A very fun and exciting game with some of the best art and miniatures I've ever seen.  I only hope they come out with an expansion with even more characters, scenarios and perhaps some more advanced rules as well.  Its a game that would lend itself to magical items, spells, talents, leveling, ect.  I also wouldn't mind a second set of the thief cards with more variable stat lines, and perhaps a couple of unique abilities each.

Fun little game. Each player has 4 thieves that try to ransack the town. All characters have the same basic skill numbers (2 strength, 4 move, 4 mind) plus one special individual skill. You can move then fight opponents or sneak into buildings and steal the loot. There are special cards to use as well. You have 7 actions per turn to be spread through your 4 characters so you don't usually move everyone. There are 8 different scenarios. There are 2 militia and 2 other figures that are used in the scenarios. It plays quickly and is fun for what it is.

Fun pick-up-and-deliver game with a fantasy theme. Also, who doesn't like playing a gang of thieves? Expansion makes it much more fun (score is with expansion included)

Typically nice FFG components and theme.  Was fun to play, but I can't see myself playing this much and won't bother to buy.  Four players pretty much spent first 2 turns running to snag all the treasure chests, 2 turns fighting and stealing each others treasure, and then the last 3 turns running to escape out of town.  Didn't have a chance to see if the other scenarios actually changed the game much or not.

Initially, what drew me to this game was the alluring theme - the story of Cadwallon expands and introduces many new and interesting plots.

After opening the box and reading about the characters, they have to be my favorite aspect of the game.  I will have to say that these are the most unique characters that Fantasy Flight has come up with for quite some time.

The rest of the components are top notch, just as expected from FFG.  The board is beautiful as is the artwork.

The gameplay however is somewhat lacking.  I have only tried this with two players, but I would assume it plays much better with a group of 3-4 players.  Turns felt monotonous and not enough conflict and/or character decisions were available.

The arcana cards, although nice at times, offered little benefit each turn.  Also, the special abilities of some characters were of little to no use as well while other characters had awesome abilities!

Although the characters themselves were the pinnacle of the game, essentially they were all the same with regards to their stats.  I think this also contributed to the monotony.

All-in-all, City of Thieves may offer more of a pleasureable gaming experience with a larger group and/or expansions.

While not a bad game slightly underwhelming, especially with timid players. For more enjoyable play everyone needs to be aggressive and attack to cause treasure to change hands (otherwise it turns into a stale waiting game).

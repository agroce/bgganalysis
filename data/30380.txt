RATING: 7
Based on one play.  Multiple routes to victory and these seem to be available to be worked out before you even start.  Pick which one you want, buy a building and away you go.  You just have to hope that no-one else buys your follow-up building(s), though they probably won't want to because it would be sub-optimal for them.
It was a good game but it seems to me that the game is just a comparison of how those pre-planned paths to victory interact with each other.

Shades of Puerto Rico but after a couple more playings I'm really starting to like this particularly with 5 where there are some difficult choices to make. The Laws mechanism is particularly good. Haven't played with El presidente but it looks like it will add even more depth (and unfortunately time).

RATING: 8.5
Role selection and resource management, with a hand managment aspect that makes for a very lively game.  There seem to be a lot of routes to victory, with shipping and building being the most valuable (sort of like another game I can think of).  It can be very interactive with several players, as being a turn to late for shipping or building can be disastrous.  The voting for the laws at the end of each round can be tense.

RATING: 8.5
A Victory Point (VP) grabbing game that on the surface seems derivative, but actually plays quite differently or at least feels relatively fresh.

The game plays over 6 rounds, and each player has an identical set of 5 character cards, 4 of which will be played as actions during each round.  Each character has a unique ability(s), as well as a voting strength.  Turn order can be important but not always crucial, and it changes depending on the highest character card (voting power) played last in the round.

The actions consist of such things as acquiring resources from your individual player boards, building buildings onto (and OVER) your resources on your player board (some get you VPs directly, and all buildings are worth 2VP at the end), buying/selling goods and products at the market, activating buildings special abilities on your player boards, and loading ships with goods/products for VPs.  Sounds similar to roles in Puerto Rico, but these are done individually, they are not shared actions.

At the beginning of each round, proposed bills are viewed, and at the end of the actions, these are voted upon using your last character card and money (blind-bid).  The highest vote total selects 2 bills to enact, and these are primarily for scoring points because you can meet the condition(s) and/or screw other players over.  Repeat this for 6 rounds, and the highest score wins.

Now it might not sound original, but after a couple of plays, it's been enjoyable and again, feels reasonably different enough from other games I own.  It also scales great from 2-5 players.  Luck is minimal in that the bills are semi-random each round, but you can control which ones actually come into play, and the most recent ship each round is random, but there is building to change that, and of course you don't even need to ship that much to win anyways.  In the couple of games I've played, I've won by focusing mainly on money and voting, and then I've also won by focusing on shipping and building.  There seems to be several viable ways to score points and win.

Nice game but pure analysis paralysis at least in the first game with my group! You can never do what you really wanted because there are so many options and therefor nobody is really happy with his decision after his turn. So I think that this just isn't fun to play. Another drawback for me is that the outcome of the game seems to be always quite close, no matter if one  player has a good strategy and another as none! There are too many "standard" victory points per  round so that our game ended with all 3 Players having the exact same amount of points and the winner with 2 points more.

Although beautifully produced, this game doesn't rise above the mundane for me. It isn't so much derivative as it is too easy to dismiss. Something is just forgettable about it as it never rises to the complex interest level of Caylus nor the tight elegance of Puerto Rico. Fine for what it is, but nothing I need to own.

I feel like I shouldn't like this game and yet I do.  Ok, so there's a lot of Caylus, Agricola, Ys, Pillars of Earth in here and maybe Container borrowed a little from this one.  Even so, I thought it hung to gether well and was a more simple game to understand than all of the above aside from Ys.

I like the artwork, I like the ship mechanisms and the market.  It seemed to play quite quickly with 3 once you got to know what was going on.

Looking forward to playing  it again and then we'll see how it shapes up.

No depth of game play, you make your strategy choice on turn one as the buildings available are fixed and lock you in to a particular strategy, after this choice is made, the ships that come out that have the available goods spaces are random, the big kicker is the legislation changes each turn, these drastically change the game and often dictate which strategy will win, if you don’t have control you will probably lose, if controlling it spends all of your resources, you will probably lose, if the legislation cards you need for your strategy come out on the last turn, you will probably lose. 

It’s a gambling game as to which strategy will win, but you won’t know which strategy is best until the last turn and you lock yourself in turn 1. I can’t see what there is to like about a game with ever closing options and opportunities.

A marked improvement over Pillars of the Earth: you don't feel as much like the game is playing you.  Only six rounds keeps it short, and there's plenty of variation in play.  The buildings almost seem like a waste with only six rounds.

Maybe the best way to describe it is that it feels like a watered-down Puerto Rico.  I dug the self-sustaining market and the plethora of ways of getting points, money, goods, etc.  I'm on the fence.  If I had two hours, I'd rather play Notre Dame, Caylus, or Puerto Rico.

Traded away.

+ A very self-deterministic game in which you can feel free to pursue any given long-term strategy; Very cool components; Excellent expansion.
- Quite a bit of a time commitment to play; Can drag on with AP-prone players.


Why it's previously-owned:
Despite being a really well-designed game that I enjoy, it just has too many similarities to other games we love without anything in particular to set it apart that made us want to play it specifically.
This got traded away for Peloponnes.

Gorgeous game that combines elements of Puerto Rico, Caylus and Pillars of the Earth.

My first thought was "Great...Another Puerto Rico Clone". But I was wrong. The theme and artwork is very similar to Puerto Rico, but the mechanics are rather different.

A fun mix of open market, Engine building, recource managment, voting. 

The spatial puzzle, with the placement of the worker and which fields you want to activate/give up for Buildings is quite interesting.

RATING: 8.5
After 3 plays.  Better and more meaty than Pillars of the Earth, but can't touch Caylus.  Seeing that I rate Pillars a 8 and Caylus a 10, that makes this one a 9.  My one complaint though is a big one.  I have never seen any game come close to this in Analysis Paralysis.  Absolutely drives me nuts - I won't downgrade the game because of it though - it's not the game's fault.

An excellent game!  Combines a number of mechanisms in a very effective manner.  Nothing really innovative, but the combination of systems is done very well.  There are elements of resource gathering, building construction, bidding for law enactment, trading, and shipping (for VP).  I really enjoyed it and look forward to more plays.  A strong recommendation, though it will likely be overwhelming for at least the first play due to the number of different mechanics involved.

A very strong worker placement game - one of my favorites! Better than Puerto Rico, since it is more intuitive and all the things you need to know are clearly laid out in the board game area. A very visually attractive game as well! The only downside with the game setup is organizing the buildings - ugh, there could have been better game design around this.

The El Presidente expansion sounds interesting, but since I'm now trying not to buy into expansion hype, I won't be getting this unless we start playing the base game a lot (not likely). 

Update: After some musings, I realize that Cuba is so great because it takes the good stuff in worker placement games and puts it into a pretty, streamlined package. 2015 UPDATE: Well, this one is out as we haven't played it in a long time and my husband likes Stone Age better.

It obviously borrowed quite a bit from Puerto Rico's popularity and everything, but it just doesn't play like Puerto Rico at all.

An efficiency game that re-shuffles familiar mechanics.  Like Pillars of the Earth this one throws in unpredictable elements to disrupt the perfect planners.  I kind of liked the voting on laws, but the rest of the game felt stale and derivative.  The nail in the coffin for me is that Cuba takes twice as long to play as Puerto Rico and in no way justifies its extra playing time.

Another eurogame where players have their plantations and gather various goods. You can use them to construct buildings, which provide you some minor abilities, or you can ship them for Victory Points. I liked the parliament phase where players vote/propose various new laws. The artwork is very nice, and the components are good.

In the end the game didn't excite me at all. Maybe because you don't really create a production engine. I didn't get the feeling that I am becoming more powerfull as the game goes on. Gameplay was a bit repetitive. Maybe the expansion spice things up.

Un juego de mesa de lo mas divertido, una curiosa mezcla entre pilares de la tierra, Caylus y Puerto Rico.

Personalmente me encanta, se me hacia algo corto para desarollar segun que estrategias, pero con la expansion de El Presidente se soluciona. El juego con la expansión para mi es sobresaliente, sin ella solo notable. 

Creo que tiene muchos puntos positivos de los juegos que he mencionado anteriormente y pocas desventajas, si a eso se le añade un arte gráfico estupendo y unos componentes excelentes tenemos un gran juego.

Me parece mas divertido Cuba que Puerto Rico, con mas opciones de juego y que escala mucho mejor con dos jugadores.

A fun and worthy game with some interesting mechanics. I enjoyed the law selection mechanic, the card order of play considerations, and the endgame penultimate and final round planning.

Somewhat to my surprise, I did not find planning to pay for taxes and duties to get victory points be to onerous or unpleasant in this game (my thoughts turn toward Year of the Dragon, Walnut Grove and Trajan where "necessity mechanics" can feel like a pain). 

Cuba is not necessarily fireworks, but it is an engaging and well designed game. On the next play, I will probably enjoy planning more, in particular, which buildings to buy, and where to advantageously place them on my plantation. Interesting game.

First play, but didn't grab me. Seemed to be too mechanic. After first couple of buildings, each player pretty much left workers in the same space, or at least in the same row/column. Was told that if one player had won first voting round (enacting the law "no vote buying" combined w/ his first building that gave him +2 votes, he would have run away. Such a scenario seems like a game flaw, imho. I'd give it another go, after I read up on the buildings, but I'd never ask for it.

i have no faults with the design.  the game works, and it doesn't seem to have any immediate turn order issues or anything like that.  very colorful production, nice components, understandable rules that are perhaps a little tough to teach.  there's role selection, economy, variable rules, shipments, player boards, lots of things that will remind you of other games like puerto rico and caylus.  esteemed company, and i suppose i'm not surprised to say that i'd much rather play either of those.  for me the main problem came down to the fact that i didn't feel like i was really building an empire or an engine, and i felt in particular that the building effects were bland.  i ended up running the water and golf course thing, which was decent, but i think there should be many more interesting and synergistic effects along those lines.  feels more wonky than its peers in terms of turn actions too.

Partially an economic engine game, but with only six rounds there's not enough time to really set it up.

Para mí uno de las mayores decepciones que he vivído en este mundillo. Es un buen juego, que duda cabe, pero desde luego no era lo que me esperaba. Es de esas ocasiones que tras leer el reglamento, explicarlo y jugar, sale una cosa totalmente inesperada y diferente a lo que me había imaginado estudiándolo y memorizándolo...

En realidad el juego es buscar con lo que haya el mejor combo y ganar en puntos a tus compañeros. Ceñirte, por ejemplo, a producir y gestionar puros y no salirte de ahí para nada... Yo pensaba que habría mucha interacción y sería de mucha gestión y tal pero se me quedó en eso, en buscar un buen combo y maximizarlo con lo que sepas, puedas y te dejen...

Le daré más partidas, sin dudarlo, pero para eso ya están el Le Havre y el Ora et Labora... Decepción quizás porque me hice unas espectativas a la altura del Caylus y el Agricola...

However it appears not to deliver in many aspects: (i) the buildings do not appear worth acquiring - in my most recent game my strategy of buying no buildings won me the game, (ii) the rum and cigars are not worth producing and (iii) the game induces in me a level of indecisiveness through the multitude of choices (which is a little different to AP) that I have not encountered in any other game.

On the plus side, the game shines as a two player strategy game where there is plenty to plan and no hidden information.  Despite my many misgivings about the game I am happy to explore and play it further (as a 2 or 3 player game).  Maybe there is a smaller streamlined game there waiting to break through!  As it stands I think aspects of this game don't work as they were intended but, as mentioned, I am happy to devote the time to prove this to myself!

Pacing seems a bit off as players only have 6 turns to generate victory point from their engines. Some innovative player board design with the use of orthogonality in planning (crop activation, building selection and placement). The bribing for votes mechanic is also very thematically incorporated within the game. Lots of gaming elements I would normally enjoy - they just don't seem to add up to a cohesive whole. Rating may go up with additional plays.

Jó kis játék, néhány eredeti ötlettel, de nem éreztem átütőnek. Pedig a kör végén a 4 (nyelvfüggő) lap közül 2 kiválasztása mindig jó kis dilemma (a választás győztesének), akárcsak az, hogy az 5 féle akcióból melyiket hagyjuk el (legtöbbször mind az 5 kellene:)). Szerintem sokutas a győzelem, bár az asztalnál az a vélemény alakult ki, hogy a behajózás tuti nyer.

Just read the rules. I think the core rules sound very interesting. There should be minimal downtime. The bills/acts makes sure that no game is a like. Great looking board and components. I am not a fan of blind bids at all but I think it fits here very well with buying votes for the bills to pass. I think it is very thematic. My only complaint is the set number of rounds to play the game. I tend to like games that has a variable end condition, which adds another level of depth. The game has very minimal luck but there are so many variables, the game won't feel dry.  Also, the theme is shining through very well.  This is really really looking good. I am looking forward to it.  

I need to re-read the Amyitis rules and see how they compare to each other. That will affect if I should put Cuba in "Buy Now" list.  

After further review, I think I am going to have to pass on this game.  Even though blind bid mechanic fits the theme very well, I don't think I'll get over the frustration I derive from this mechanic.  Also, the random ships makes the game very tactical, since you cannot really plan ahead for them.  I guess you could do a house rule of placing all the ships in order to be used so that people can plan for them.  Hmm... seems like an easy fix.  Blind bidding is my biggest hang up at the moment.

Just read a wonderful review and unfortunately, this goes in the "Try before Buy" pile.

RATING: 8.5
A short resource management/economic game with very nice components. I wish the scale was tipped on the complexity side, more buildings, more complicated, more game time, more vp engine building. It left me with a so-so feel, like it was good but not there yet. The laws really don't convince me at all. Still, it is a good game that I'd play again.

After some plays, I think I overrated the game :(
the spatial element and the constantly changing laws add unnecessary frustration to the gameplay.

LOOKS like Caylus, Saulen Die Erde, Puerto Rico and Fluxx have had a most horrible accident with a blender. Has some similarities to mentioned games but does not play like them, all the actions are different in some aspect to the other games, the action might be called the same ( i.e. shipping to earn VP ) but the manner and effects are different.

At first, I didn't grasp the subtleties of the game: it seemed tactical but not strategic at all. After a few plays it grew on me as I started seeing more. There's definitely strategy, but in an unusual way: you have to accomodate it inside a very short game, while staying flexible enough to react to others. Very good game, with the upside of the great artwork by Michael Menzel.

Excellent component quality and complex variations of several elements (resource generation, resource conversion, bidding, card play, tile placement, building with various activated benefits) make for a challenging and enjoyable game. Ability to directly interfere with other player plans appears limited, perhaps less than Puerto Rico. There seems to be multiple valid strategies to succeed, rapidly becoming a favorite.

Een tweede keer gespeeld (maar eerste keer blijkbaar niet genoteerd).  Weeral verre van gewonnen.  Ik had nochtans 2 op elkaar inspelende gebouwen (met water), maar dit heeft me enkel in't begin wat voorsprong gegeven.

Tips:
- Plaats je gebouwen in (schaak)paard vorm.  Zo kan je ze samen activeren op verschillende plaatsen, en toch nog voldoende opbrengsten genereren.
- Startspeler zijn is toch wel een groot voordeel, dus tracht dit af en toe te worden.

Het speelt vlotjes, maar ik ben er nog steeds niet enthousiast over.

It took me a while to get this on the table, partly because I thought it may be too complicated for a lot of folks.  There are a good number of rules, but it flows better than I thought it would.  In our first game, 3 of the 4 of us kind of stumbled through... especially me.  After explaining the rules, I (as start player) used the tradesewoman to buy a tobacco for 4 pesos that I could have taken with an alternative action and I had a tobacco spoil at the end of the round.  That's about as dumb as it gets, but I still enjoyed the game.  I undervalued the parliamentary phase of the game.  I look forward to trying this again to see if it's gonna stick around or just be kind of clever and go away.

Second game played was also very good and with the same group.  Seems like we all had a better idea what we were doing.  I ended up with a lot of money and other than bidding 8 pesos for nothing one round, I felt like the money was helpful.  I really like this game so far... I'm not sure how many times it could be played and still loved,  but I think it has a lot of potential.

First two plays were very long with a lot of social interaction.  I played it once with more focus from everyone at the table and liked it again.  Seems like a tough game to get to the table, but it's good when it gets there.

I like this. Have only played two player so far, but that works really well. Looking forward to playing with more though. This game has a lot of what I enjoy in games: resource handling, a spatial component in the worker/building placement, and role selection. A very pretty game as well.

Edit: Have played it with more players and it is still great. The only problem is that is feels too much like so many other games, it doesn't bring anything unique to the table, so we rarely play it. Good fun when we do though.

Very enjoyable, certainly left me wanting to play again. On the face of it, quite similar to PR but the gameplay is very different the various laws, the variety of the ships and the many ways to access victory points definitely shakes things up, whilst the fact that you can only use an ability once per turn (and you must save one and not use it at all) is great.

I enjoyed my first play (with 5 players), but thought it wasn't something that I wanted to own. But as the day went on (and I played 6 other games), I couldn't stop thinking about this one. I definitely want to play it again, after which I'll decide if I want to pick up my own copy. While the different building powers and the strategy of creating a point engine around a few of them felt extremely similar to Pillars of the Earth, I didn't find anything else similar to it. I liked it much better than Pillars and think it has a lot more replayability. The similarities to Puerto Rico also seemed incidental, and it didn't really have that kind of feel to me. Kudos to the designers for taking familiar mechanics and themes and reworking them to make a really interesting game. I can't wait to play it again.

Feels hard to get an "engine" going. But, that makes all moves tense. No time to waste.

Edit: The (overpriced) expansion really fleshes out the game, and I especially appreciate the extra two turns. Bumps my rating up a notch. (Though, I think I might have some rose colored glasses on, based on my recent money-driven, non-shipping come-from-behind victory.)

As my friend said, it is similar to PR (as well as Caylus/Pillars, etc) but at least to me it it's own vibe.  It was quite simple to get going in and it moved along pretty quick.  Solid.

Update:  I'm not sure why this one doesn't make it back to the table.  Perhaps the six rating is right on.  I think other games feel the same as this one but I don't have to re-hash through the rules.  I guess that is my fault more than the game.

Everyone makes a fuss about the voting aspect, but to me the player-board lines-and-column system is definitely where the game is.

Has too little interaction to hold my interest for more than 2 or 3  plays. Perhaps the overpriced expansion will fix that, we'll see. 

Update: it does, with the expansion this game is an 8/10.

RATING: 7.6
Elements of Puerto Rico and Caylus for sure. I don't own Pillars of the Earth (another game that Cuba is compared to) so there is room for this in my collection...

Only a couple of plays of this so far and they were too far apart to give me any benefit of familiarity with the game. I would like to play more frequently to try some different strategies. My second game saw my political domination approach getting me second place by 5 points in a 15 point spread over 5 players.

Interesting game. Beautiful components, theme matching with game mechanics. Rating is based upone one play. Felt that starting player had advantage. Producing rhum and cigars cost significant effort in relation to the gains you get from it. amá-lo comparison to make with Puerto Rico. This is about picking roles, building manufacturing and shipping goods. Puerto Rico is another league - much better.

I thought I had a great strategy with Rum production and Rum exchange for VP in the same worker lines as 2 sugar. But, it wasn't quite enough VP to keep up and I lost by 4 or 5 VP.  I really like the difficult decision of which production fields to build over.  You don't want to sacrifice your resource collection, but you want the buildings in line for activation... very cool game.

Cuba is a mix of just about every early to mid-2000's euro game.  Worker placement, VP transformations, resource management, role selection, etc.  It's a beautiful board, the components are nice.... and I was entirely underwhelmed by it.  While it does pretty much everything, it does not do anything particularly well.  On top of that, the single differentiator, the bill voting, had little to no effect on the game and really just seemed to take up time.  My overall impression is that I'm entirely underwhelmed by the game and I really don't see why I'd play it over other games in my collection that while not doing everything, do something better.  Perhaps it's just that this game has been eclipsed by better games while not really measuring up and earning the classic status of it's contemporary counterparts Caylus and Puerto Rico.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
First play was a bit underwelming, I felt I'd seen this sort of game before, certainly seen the majority of the mechanisms and it felt like mulitplayer solo and your ability to plan wrecked by the randomness of the laws. 2nd play, opinion was revised, knowing what laws are in the piles really makes a difference, now you can plan for when a law comes into play - saving the right resources and putting yourself in a position to benefit, game is all about optimising your actions - and where to place the buildings. 3rd play, now I'm not playing this multiplayer solo anymore, I'm looking at the other players and trying to predict what they are going to do .... for me this game needs multiple playings for the systems to click - it seems to scale from 2-5 quite well, shipping is easier with less of course. Is it a solid keeper? I'm not sure, but I expect to get 20 or so playings out of it before it gets stale.

*** Update - nope, no interest from people for it now, rating dropped and it is on the trade pile.

**** Update, played it again and bored with it now, expansion is insanely expensive ... traded it away and I don't miss it.

The sound of the fan whirring overhead and the light scent of cigar smoke wafting into the cafe, compete with your friends in managing Cuban plantations.

Awesome game-Love it!! There are 3-4 solid scoring paths or engines you get churning and to shoot for in this game.  In turn one you begin to sort out potential paths and then in rounds 2-3 you are honing in on your real strategy.  Lots of scoring ops give you options along the way to round out your effort, and it reminds one of Puerto Rico. My advice is: sit where you can see the buildings and their various descriptions left available for purchase. (similar to Puerto Rico)

The Parlimentary vote mechanic is pretty nifty allowing for you to subvert other players successes and I have yet to see anyone really dominate within that aspect.

My one complaint of this lovely game is that I wish it went maybe even one more cycle though as the game ends a little soon or abruptly.  It seems like right around when you feel your scoring is really going get firing on all 8, the game ends abruptly.

RATING: 3
My rating is based solely on my personal feelings about this type of game.  Cuba has solid mechanics and production that expresses its' theme very nicely, perhaps even better than Puerto Rico.  However, for me, running a plantation is a boring idea and the gimmicky building selection is a tired and stale mechanic.

Like a better looking Puerto Rico, with a better theme.  As for the strategy... I don't know.  I haven't noticed a consistent strategy that works.  May not hold up to repeat plays.

RATING: N/A
A number of glowing reviews caused me to math trade for Cuba.  I read the rules multiple times, and then set it up for a 3er solo game to make sure I understood it.  By the time I had the game set up, I was ready to trade it.  The main issue is the buildings - there are 25, and they all do different things, and they are all available to purchase from the start.  This is a ridiculously large decision space for those I game with, and is what made me decide to trade the game away.  With the right player aid - and the right players - this might not be an issue, but it was for me. 

The rest of the game has a similar level of detail.  Each decision made has significant long term effects that must be considered.  One starts with 5 cards which represent actions.  The order that one takes these actions matters, and the action that is not selected also matters.  How one moves their manager on their personal board matters not just for this turn, but probably for the next one as well.  

Overall, the game looks like it all comes together really well.  But the level of detail and long range planning involved were prohibitive for those I play with.

Fue un gran descubrimiento este juego. Es un juego de selección. Cada jugador dispone de 5 personajes y una finca donde hace sus construcciones y recolecta sus recursos. Durante un turno (se juegan seis), cada jugador va a utilizar cuatro personajes. El quinto va a servir para votar leyes (apoyado por dinero en subasta oculta).
El trabajador va a recolectar productos y recursos de tu finca, según su ubicación (recoger todo lo que se encuentre en la fila x y columna y, si su ubicación es x,y). Además, en la finca se pueden construir edificios que otorgan ciertas habilidades. Para ello hay que usar otro personaje (el capataz), que "activa" los edificios, también según la ubicación del trabajador (o uno cualquiera). Esto hace que el manejo del tablero de cada jugador de que pensar.. :).
Además, existe la posibilidad de acudir al mercado, con precios variables, para comprar/vender productos y vienes (vendedora). También se puede "exportar" bienes y productos, para convertirlos en puntos de victoria (con el alcalde) y usar el arquitecto para construir edificios en tu finca (pagando coste en recursos y normalmente habilitan para ciertas transformaciones).

Además, y como guinda, en cada turno se aprueban dos leyes que modifican alguna regla del juego. LAs leyes están divididas en cuatro equipos. Las dos primeras permiten comprar directamente puntos de victoria a difernetes precios en materiales/dinero. La tercera otorga puntos según la característica de tu finca y la cuarta impone ciertas limitaciones y hace algunas reglas más estrictas.

En definitiva, un juego en el que hay mucho que pensar durante la partida y se hace muy emocionante. Altamente recomendable.

Rating based on one play.  Not a bad game, but didn't feel like it brought much new to the table.  Plays like a cross between Puerto Rico, Caylus, and some weird voting game, but less satisfying than any of those.  I think I'm getting jaded.

This is a beautiful brain-burner of a resource conversion game, with plenty of conflict and traumatic decision-making throughout. If it suffers from anything, it's that all the choices are offered from the very start; the turns don't have a script, against which you can easily base a strategy for your game. For example, in Puerto Rico, you're collecting cash to begin with, and shipping your goods or filling up your city from the mid-game; and the buildings scale up in cost so you get access to them as your game develops. By contrast, in Cuba, you can probably buy most of the buildings on Turn 1, because you don't really get a production engine going, it's running well enough from the start.

This game is missing something. Heart? Intrigue? Gaminess?? I don't know but it just doesn't have what it takes to keep me interested. I don't hate it - but it definitely isn't my favourite.

11/28/07 - copy was waiting for me at my FLGS. Opened it up right there on the spot and enjoyed a 5er game. After the first game (a few days earlier) I thought it was a hodge podge of mechanics trying to make a game out of it - but, as is usual with the Eurogame design - it needed another play to get ones brain around it. There's a few things to consider in this game and the choices can be somewhat overwhelming to someone who hasn't played these types of games so it may not be something you introduce to newbies.

Seen by some as a PR clone I think Cuba gets overlooked. A solid resource management and auctioning game. One thing it does share with PR is a convenient vagueness on who it is that is working on all these planations ;-)  I really enjoy the government aspect of this game, voting (and bribing) for control of the government and decision on which bills to introduce greatly increases the variety in this game giving it a lot of replay value.

RATING: 5
Cuba is one of those games that takes many different mechanics and synthesizes them into a singular experience.  Some may call this "borrowing," others "ripping off," but I don't really care what you call it, as long as it works.  And Cuba works - it just isn't that much fun.

For 4 or 5, I could see this being ideal, brutal and chaotic.  For two, there is little tension.  In fact, the 2er is a little too unbalanced, as the shipping route becomes too valuable to ignore, leading to a shipping-directed game.  This is easily fixable (just eliminate the 3VP ship), but even fixed, the game has too little tension to be interesting.  Getting anywhere in the game takes a while, as the VP machine is a long one to build.  If the game were a couple of turns longer, it might be long enough to generate some interest by building up a VP engine, but as it is, the game ends a little early.  I know, the expansion fixes this - but is $30 worth it just to improve a mediocre experience into a possibly decent one?  I doubt it.

Cuba is not bad, and some will like it.  As a 2er, though, it just kind of falls flat - you end up wanting to play one of the games it is imitating, which likely does its one novel mechanism amazingly, rather than this, which has many bland-ish options.  Should be the ideal Euro, but for us, it just didn't quite get there.

Interesting game, with strong Puerto Rico influences but a different feel.  Acumulating resources and activating buildings is a tough balancing act.  The tweaks to the game state via the Bills/Acts is a nice maguffin and the production is top-notch too, making for a nice package.  Need to play more to be sure quite how good though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Second impressions were more favorable. I actually think Cuba is a fairly clever resource management/kingdom building game, but it is absolutely killed by the slow pace and the downtime, of which there is a lot. A lot of analysis and look-ahead has to be done to accomplish much of anything, but there is extremely little interactivity to the game, and certain bottlenecks make it hard to plan too far ahead. I think Cuba works as a game and has plenty of interesting things happening, but I think it just takes too long to play with too much downtime to be worth it.

It's also a fixed-fun game where more players is better. I think the game really wants 5, but the pacing was bad enough with 4.

A game I would like to like, and if it came in at two-thirds of the length I'm pretty sure I would, but as it is I think it's going direct to the trade/sale pile.
---
First impression is that the game feels off. Not long enough for things to develop in interesting ways, not enough really viable different ways to go due to the brevity, not enough interesting player interaction. Sort of Puerto Rico without either the attention to detail or any of the actual inspiration that made Puerto Rico great. I've only played once, but so far I regret my purchase (and this sucker is not cheap). We'll see if a second play makes a better impression.

Hrrm, after one play, I had a good time with it but am hesitant that there are many ways to go about actually winning this game.

[13/11{2007] The designers of this workman-like and thoroughly unoriginal design meshed together various mechanisms found in Puerto Rice, Caylus and Säulen der Erde. I will concede it works, but is it fun?!? Its action selection mechanism isn't nearly as interesting as Puerto Rico's role selection or even Caylus's workers. I put this down to the level of player interaction being (yet) lower than in those two games. Really, it seems far more of a game in which you implement a once-conceived plan rather than one in which interaction with other players may dramatically alter your course during a game.

In Cuba, players focus on perfecting their own little economic puzzles. Many "heavy" Euros have such a multiplayer solitaire character, so there must be a sizable gamer demographic into such accountant-style gaming. I myself am bored stiff by this sort of brooding play, particularly when playing time is as long as in the case of Cuba.

The solitaire puzzle aspect of one's personal board is remiscent of Princes of Florence's Tetris-style building aspect. Here you need to work out your best layout of your industries on a number of rows and columns. Just a variation of the tetris-style layouting.... Yawn.

How come the game was called Cuba?!? Its pace is so pedestrian and there's no Caribbean flair whatsoever! One would hope that the laws and voting might create excitement, but it's nothing more than a not particularly interesting closed-fist-auction. Compare that to the voting in say In the Shadow of the Emperor. There you have to devine what way others will vote. The whole psychological aspect is woefully underdeveloped. Talk of a missed opportunity!

Tediously long and overwrought. Little player interaction. Multiplayer solitaire... Cuba is everything I don't want a Euro to be.

A mix of many different games I like; for instance Puerto Rico, Pillars of the Earth, World Without End etc. But it's still it's own and I don't think it replaces any of the other games, it just adds a different twist - and it's a twist I like so far. It's always hard to figure out where to place your buildings as they ruin your fields, and that is a great mechanic! The role-selection and the votes for the parliament are two other things I think add a lot to this game and makes it stand out. Nevertheless, I don't think the game is that good - it takes too long for what it is, especially when adding the expansion. There isn't much tension with just 2 players.

My personal recommended number of players: 3, 4
Best with: 4

RATING: 5
Like Puerto Rico but with many more choices. Extreme danger of AP, particularly with new players. The parliament phase is clever. Choosing the card you will play in the parliament phase at the start of the round works well and probably speeds up play as you have fewer choices. I'd rate this a few points lower with s--l--o--w players.

RATING: 3
I so so WANTED to like this, I really did, so why did I give it only a 3?
Is it broken? No, so why won't I play it again?
Because I think the VP model is slightly wonky;
i) processed goods - taking an extra action to 'prepare' - get just as many VP as raw goods
ii) the margin of victory is so low, that whoever goes first, and builds the  2VP building stands a VERY good chance of winning by 12 VP - the very margin that that building gives them. In every game I have played, I have win with that building. In all of the last few, when others knew how to play, by exactly 12 VP!

I have other gripes, but basically, I've sold my copy and won't be buying another

A lot of the thematic mechanisms come from Puerto Rico, but Cuba does hold its own weight as its own game.  The unique decisions for this game are trying to maximize your worker usage to get as many plantations and buildings activated during a game turn.  The corrupt government of cuba and how it awards points is also a neat way to randomize the game so its not the same from time to time.

RATING: 6
This is very much a build your own victory points engine in isolation from the other players. It is less like the Caylusy Puetro Rico it had been described to me as. Each turn you select four out of five actions you have as cards: produce resources, ship resources, buy/sell resources, activate buildings or build a building. It is not like Puerto Rico though because the selection only really affects you and you don't block someone using the action or activate a phase for all players. The only similarity to Caylus is that you buy buildings but noone else can use them. It is a pretty game and plays quickly but it just doesn't stand out from a sea of cube manipulators.

Well Fidel...this game is the opposite of you, it looks pretty, plays well with others but in end leaves you feeling like something is not right. I can't put my finger on it. This is no Puerto Rico and I even like playing Hamburgum more than this. I did enjoy it don't get me wrong, just did not fall in love. I am not sure if this is going to get played much or at all. I will have to try it again to see but after that this may get shelved. I have way to many games and see no need to have similiar games when one is vastly superior.

Similar to Pillars of the Earth, (same designers) with a "more of everything" feel. Many paths to victory. Lots of options. Seems like there might be only a few master strategies just waiting to be found. A certain level of randomness helps alleviate this. 

You can get a decent engine going about half way through the game, but it ends a little too soon for my liking. Expansion looks to extend things a bit, which is fine by me. 

Great artwork on components and board.

[b]Update[/b]: [i]Finally[/i] got to play this, and I really liked it.  Very tough decisions, and you really need to learn what buildings do, and what combinations work well together.  Also, placement of the buildings on your board really matters.  This is a game that will take several plays for me to develop a good strategy.  The rules aren't great, but after one play, I think we've got everything figured out.  Very glad I got this!

For me, this game combines the best elements of Puerto Rico, Power Grid, and Mission: Red Planet, which is reason enough to own it.  And the voting / bills is a nice little additional feature.  Good stuff.

This game is a refinement of many euro mechanics - most notably some of those seen in Caylus and Puerto Rico.  There are ships that can be filled up with goods for victory points, as well as buildings that can be placed on an individual player mat which allow for various good exchanges and victory points.  Although clearly derivative, the mechanics blend together in unique ways to create an engaging game.  Nice that it scales to two players, although haven't played enough with that number to know if it's better or worse than with other numbers.

1 learning game (4p) - seems excellent; I feel like I've barely touched the strategic possibilities, which may be heavy. It's one of many Eurogames where you competitively create your engine, and then convert your output into victory points, but with some exceptions, many twists, tactics and choices, and shiftingly nervous possibilities. (I'm not sure but the elements may be designed to limit "engine" perfection, so if true you also need to optimize your waste and unconsumed input.) It's processional but not quite solitaire, for there's conflict with other players in the limited choices (buildings, actions).  Also on my mind here is a taste issue:  sometimes I think I'm looking for a more spatial type of conflict than the common Eurogame type of conflict defined by the narrowing of "engine" action choices.

Cuba is a solid game with clear relationships to Caylus, among others. However, its packaged in a more time-friendly way.

A lot to think about here- hand management and timing of using your different people is key. Worker, trades woman, architect, foreman and mayor. An "older" game but coming off a recent play thru of Clans of Caledonia, it reminded me a lot of that. Economic with buying and selling at the market, getting resources and products you can change for refined goods or victory points...having enough money and resources  to do everything, very tight game and could be prone to AP in some folks. Excellent game and we're thinking of getting the expansion.

I have played two games of this and my god it was two games too many! 

This games takes elements from other games like Puerto Rico and Caylus. Well they do their thing much better than this piece of crap. 

This game can be summed up in one word: TEDIOUS. The game just goes on and on and on... I feel for the trees that gave their lives for all the cool components in the game. The components are the only reason I gave it a 3.

Also, why in every Euro game does everyone pictured in them have to have smiles like they have overdosed on Valium or Paxil, when they are typically some poor sod working in the fields for a couple of pesos a week?!?

Nagyon szép tábla, kiváló komponensek. Mély, gondolkodtató játék.
Nagyon jó elemekből gyúrták össze (szerepválasztás, politikai befolyás, törvények, munkáslehelyezés, nyersanyagtermelés, épületek építése és aktiválásuk). Persze ezeket már láttuk máshol, ám ez mit sem von le a Cuba nagyszerűségéből, hiszen ezeket nagyon jól egymásba építették, jól működnek együtt.
Fix 6 körből kell a legjobbat kihozni. Tökéleteset nem lehet a szűkösség miatt alkotni, de talán pont ezért ennyire jó.

RATING: 4
It took me a while to realise what it is that Cuba attempts to accomplish. It looks like a standard resource snowball engine, but it isn't. In fact, it is the opposite. Where games like Macao, Puerto Rico, and many more have the players construct little engines, Cuba goes in the other direction. It is all tactics, all scoring for the moment, and modifying the player sequence order to make sure that profitable shipping spaces and other shared game elements are available when [i]you[/i] want them to be available. This requires a completely different mode and style of play: one which is far more opportunistic. Now that is a perfectly legal way to construct a game; I just wonder whether such a mode of play has lasting appeal. It is hard to say why a player won a particular game: he just weaseled better than the others, that's about as far as you can go.

There are plenty of moments where you 'feel' the presence of the other players, however: this isn't a game where you can afford to keep busy with your own little playing field. At the same time, the game is sometimes frustrating in that moves which give you points are simply no longer available, requiring you to make what feels like sure suboptimal moves. My greatest source of frustration is that there are a [i]lot[/i] of buildings which appear to do absolutely nothing interesting at all. Take, for example, the Cement Factory. It costs 1 wood and 2 stone to build, and converts 4 stone into 4 VP. A player can only get 3 stone per turn: one from the tradeswoman (and then only using a specific action which is available to a single player per round only), two from his plantation board. But stone is required for other buildings (worth 2 VP at the end of the game), and at some point you may want to put your worker in a different spot, use the foreman in a different way, or use the tradeswoman in a different way. It doesn't at all sound like a good deal to me save for dotting a few i's. The same goes for money-making buildings. It takes quite a bit of effort to set up, and then gives you very little cash in return. Often you want money [i]now[/i] or in the next turn; not in three turns or so. The market is seldom interesting because the prices of goods are often too low to sell against an interesting price, and often too high for regular purchasing. And so forth. The more I play the game, the more I get irritated with the game's senseless friction which does nothing worthwhile save have every player hunting for scraps and morsels which turned up at some point; indeed, [i]weasling[/i] for all they're worth.

As a result, I've lowered my rating. There are good ideas lurking in Cuba, but they didn't come out nearly as well as I would have liked.

[b]Update[/b]   After playing for the first time in a long time (several years) I look upon this title with an air of [i]What in blazes had I been smoking when I bought it?[/i] (Which, considering that I don't smoke, takes some doing obviously.) I already nailed the gist of the main problems above: it's all about weasling points here and there. An exceedingly boring way of creating a game. Downgraded by two points, moved to the trade pile. Its successor Santiago de Cuba is so much more fun: it keeps the point weasling, but removes needlessly tacked on mechanisms which don't add anything save for causing friction and annoyed tempers. Plus it keeps the game light and accessible: Cuba itself pretends to be big and strategic, but it isn't.

Like Colosseum, this game is a mash of mechanisms, some worker placement, some role selection, and an auction thrown in for fun. Colosseum does this mixture a bit better, and has better bits. I prefer games with one mechanism this one has too many.

Played first time at Fire & Ice Con.  Probably will pick this one up sometime in a trade.

The comparisons to Puerto Rico and Caylus are correct.  Quite a bit more luck than Caylus but not too much.

My favorite element of this game is the law governance.  I've won quite a few games by focusing on this element.  And, there is an auction controlling the laws too.  Yummy!

Bits and board are beautiful to look at too.  Solid game.

The game has two innovative mechanics, the Laws and the board activation, and between them made for an interesting game.

Update: better after the second game (which I won by 1 point!). We played it wrong the first time (simultaneous hidden action card selection ala 'Race for the Galaxy'). There are different routes to victory, but shipping a lot with the 3VP ship seems to be the route to go.

RATING: 7.5
Cuba on the surface appears to be a typical worker placement game (collect goods, erect buildings, ship goods), but it adds a few interesting elements to set it apart.  Players select one of five roles to play each turn, with the last being reserved for voting in parliament.  That voting is influenced by bribes (essentially a silent auction), with the outcome setting new rules for the round.

What really makes the game shine is how everything is inter-related, so you really must choose the timing of your actions very carefully.  This is particularly crucial when adding buildings, which cover up spaces you would normally collect goods.

Not my favorite game in the genre, but unique enough to stay in our collection.

Very good game material, but too less interactions und too complex actions. The player himself is his own biggest opponent by building the wrong buidings on the wrong places. This game is puerto rico on a more complex way (with caylus meachanisms) but the mechanisms don't work.

First impression: a mix between Puerto Rico and Caylus. Better than Caylus but not as good as Puerto Rico.

Cuba has a great beautiful board with great artwork on the component tiles as well.  I liked the options that the building tiles gave me, and the decisions you have to make in covering tiles on your player board.  I also liked the concept of the action card select with the alternate options.

We played with the El Presidente expansion, which I liked.  This gave you a little more variability in taking the actions you needed.  

I don't have much of an opinion on the laws.  I did like that they were not overly harsh.  They added some flavor, which was nice.

The thing I did not like was how the action selection cards worked out in the game.  Nearly every player turn started with the same action.  Then the shipping part usually played out one of two ways each turn.  So that means that a good part of deciding what to do each turn is too similar from turn to turn.  

So this reduced the number of decisions I had available making the game too light in my opinion.  The game was solid, but it was just missing something for me hook me.

There is a lot to like, so I would like to play it again.  I think there is a lot of replay with the way the buildings work.  It has some good puzzle moments, but the cards are a let down.

I don't think the game is as heavy as BGG lists, though.  It's a good game, and more accessible than the weight would imply.

This game surprised the heck out of me.  It's sort of a mashup of mechanics from different games (Puerto Rico, Caylus) but I've found to to be at least enjoyable - if not moreso - than the games it borrows from.  It has enough player interaction where it counts to make the game very cutthroat.  Seems like there are lots of ways to win as well.  A new favorite.

Edit: Cuba is still a good game, but it has turned out to be a little forgettable.

Possibly, the most beautiful-looking game I own.  The game play is also really interesting; you start with plantations generating basic resources, but you build your immprovements on top of those plantations, limiting your resource income.  Add in voting on rule-changes and an econmoic market sequence, and you've got a fairly complex but accessible game.

Wooden rum bottles and cigar boxes are solid and add a nice touch without being a distraction. This is a great medium-weight Euro consisting of role selection and a bit of engine building. Laws provide some interesting variations of the gameplay and offer alternative ways to score points. Beautiful central board and player boards.  Sound mechanics all combined to make for a very solid gaming experience.  Only drawback is that the upgraded goods (rum and cigars) don't seem as valuable as they should.  A player could completely ignore either and still win.  There needs to be more of an incentive to pursue those.

I've played this 3 times now and have thoroughly enjoyed it every time. 

There are a lot of mechanics and therefore a lot of rules but it is well worth working through them.

The variety of mechanics mean that every turn is filled with individual puzzles but the competition for the market, buildings, shipping and for political power mean that there is a huge amount of player interaction.

The game is always very satisfying and feels grand in it's proportions but (rules explanations aside) never seems to drag and has very little downtime.

Always willing to play.

The player board is unique... the way you position your worker affects which resources you produce as well as which buildings you can activate. Those boards have a side where all players have an identical setup and a side where all players have a different setup. Very nice. 

Apart from that, there is building, shipping, buying and selling, production and the ability to affect the overall rules (by voting for new laws). A lot of great stuff.

Good worker-placement/resource management/programming game that is in the realm of Puerto Rico with a little bit more going on.

The spacial sub-game that takes place on your player board creates interesting decisions and there's the element of figuring out how to play your character cards in the right order to 1) maximize the engine building, and/or 2)beat your opponents to parts of the board. Sometimes those objectives conflict leading to more fun decision making.

Good game with a good theme and great art and pieces that is somewhat underrated as an intro game.

The game is too long and feels somewhat dull. Not a game I'd ask to play.

The game itself feels weird. You have the usual role selection system and resource optimization seen in other games but they are not as important here as all players have and can play the roles they want each turn. As the game progress it actually feels like you have fewer and fewer options as opposed to many other building games where the more you build the more options you get.

Fun game.  Played one 5er game.  The game tends to reward long-term planning.  I liked the resource generation, building purchases/activations, bills.  The one thing I didn't care for was how bills were passed.  The blind bidding thing where you lose your bid is pretty harsh.  Also, it was not obvious what happens when there are ties and no one wants to bid to break ties.  I'd probably rate this a 7, but I expect replayability to be low.  There are only a few bill cards...they are all going to see play every game.  The game does seem to reward a single-minded strategy, not offering much opportunity to switch tracks.  And if you wind up sharing the tracks w/another player, it will impact your score in a bad way.

Players are commodity dealers in early Cuba, trying make their fortunes and influence legislation.  Some proposed laws are flipped up, players take turns taking actions to acquire, process, and dispose of stuff, then laws are voted on.  Repeat this for six turns.  Behind this lofty description we have a fairly routine cube mincer - take actions, manipulate stuff, and spit out victory points.  Who can do it the best wins.  Looks glorious, and is mildly interesting, but feels like it's on the coattails of many other games that do it better.  Not bad by any means, but not that great either.  Feels a bit long, and like they forgot to add the fun factor.

After my first play, I quite like the game. The game has been on my wishlist for the longest time. The only thing holding me back from getting it is the parliament/politics.

I may have overjudged the game a little, as the voting phase at the parliament is not even difficult to understand.

I really like the part where when you build a building, it actually covers the production space. The decision to pick which production space to be permanently covered (thus stopping it's production) is quite critical, and I like that part.

Components are great (the game us known for that), especially the rum bottle.

The variable phase order is quite interesting nevertheless. A little twist from Puerto Rico, and I like both styles.

3-4 éve játszottunk vele utoljára, most újra előkerült, főképp azért -is- mert hála a Kártyagyárnak, meg magamnak :-), már magyar nyelvűek lettek benne a kártyák.
Ugyanakkor ez azon kevés játék egyike, amit nem tudok jól játszani -pl sosem nyertem még benne. 
De ettől független a véleményem, h tetszik is meg nem is.
A játék maga szép. A kiegje is.
Ügyesen van összerakva, végül is jól tervezhető, a kieg plusz izgalmakat tesz bele. Ugyanakkor mindig úgy éreztem, h egyrészt picit túl hosszú ahhoz képest, h milyen jó. Persze mi hajlamosak vagyunk néha elhúzni egy játékot, de nm ezért, azaz nem a konkrét játékidő a bajom, hanem a játékidő/tartalom hányados. Igaz "mostanában" mindig a fullos játékot játsszuk, azaz pl kieggel 8 forduló. És itt játszható lenne 6-ig, valszeg az jobb lenne, de nem annyival. A másik bajom, h -úgy érzem- 2-3 fordulóval a vége előtt meg lehet mondani a végső sorrendet.
Tegnap is ez történt, egy helycsere volt az utolsó 3 fordulóban, de az várható volt, és ha fogadni kell 80-90%-ban ezt tippeltem volna.
Fogunk még vele játszani, de...

Played my first game this weekend(Easter 2009). I enjoyed my first game. It is a game which is a mix of Puerto Rico and Caylus. An interesting mix indeed. I got all three games.

I want to play it again. I finished last in my game. So I want to do better. Now that I know the rules, am looking forward to a second game.

Nice artwork, good components. Wonder about its replay value. Good resource management. Wonder if the is a one unique strategy or not.

2 players seems fine with the BGG-suggested house rule that there are only two ships.  I don't mind a bit of complexity in a game, but I want to feel like I at least "get" the game after one or two plays.  After 4 plays, I still don't feel like I "get" Cuba (I had the same problem with Race for the Galaxy).  What does this building do?  Where should I put it?  Blah, I have a headache!  Lowered rating from 7 to 6.  0-4

After reading the rules of this game, I immediately thought of Puerto Rico but with a bit more complexity.  After playing it I still can't help comparing it to Puerto Rico.  Associating your actions with player order and votes for new bills was definitely clever, but I prefer the role selection of Puerto Rico.  The one thing I prefer about Cuba over Puerto Rico is that it probably has a more variety.  Even though I prefer PR, you definitely owe it to yourself to try this and see what you prefer.  The artwork alone will make it worthwhile.

SOLD IT!

A lighter version of other similar games. There is less of a "whoops, I made a single bad decission and will now be at a serious disadvantage" feel that I get from games like Caylus, and more of a "well, I'm making some generaly good decissions, so I will have a good shot at wining" feeling. This could be a good or bad thing depending on what kind of game you prefer.

I will say that I always feel like I have done very little by the end of a game session. With only 30 actions taken per player (6 rounds times 4 actions and 1 voting/resolution step) you will often take an entire round to simply make one "play". What I mean is that my turn might be; position a worker, get a resource, sell it, and trade it for a victory point. The kind of thing that would happen MANY times in a similar game and not just a few times in this one. I understand that longer game would only see your economic engine repreat itself, but I would prefer a more satisfied end game feel.

RATING: 8
I think I can start this off as an 8.  Not higher, because it's really just a rehash of mechanics that have already been sucessful in other games.  I'm getting bored of 'shipping goods for vps' and 'buildings that I place on my mat that have special powers'... oh, and there is a market where I can buy or sell goods.  It has refined these a little bit, and they certainly fit together well, but it's time for a change.  I just don't see this being a perfect 10 for me at any point.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A pale imitation of Puerto Rico, this game borrows the plantation player board, the idea of choosing roles which determine player actions, the concept of shipping goods on vessels with restricted cargo capacities, and the construction of buildings which give players special privileges or advantages; unfortunately, its designers didn't duplicate Puerto Rico's tense decision making, interesting player interaction, or engaging theme.  Even the Caribbean island theme seems lifted from Puerto Rico.

The game does offer some worthwhile innovations, particularly the clearing of spaces on the plantation boards to erect buildings, forcing a player to sacrifice resource production for development, the mechanism for choosing the first player and the idea of the Statutes (which can affect victory point computation and which can be enacted by purchased votes) are mildly interesting. 

On the whole, the game strikes me as a mediocre copy of Puerto Rico, emulating many successful attributes of its inspiration yet lacking the genius that makes the original great.  Truly, the similarities between this game and Puerto Rico are so pronounced as to make it appear to be a shameless copy with just enough changes made to avoid a lawsuit.  An OK game, rated 5 by me and by my wife, but IMHO, you'd be wise to buy Puerto Rico and forget about Cuba.

None of the mechanics really seem new.  Too large a percentage of the game is not really under a player's control.  There's very little direct player interaction, but lots of kingmaker opportunities for the losing players.

4 players was more fun than 5 players. With 5 so many things change during the turn that you will very likely have to rethink what you were planning to do once it's your turn again. This additional time that can't be squeezed in ahead of time slows the game down big time.

Great with 3.

I'm not entirely sold on this Caylus-meets-Puerto Rico.
It's definitely too short and I've seen people with no strategy, who didn't load ships, win. It seems that the game ends before you can get a system or goods-producing industry going. I'm going to have to play a few more times to see if it's really that great.

Cuba falls into that space of being a reasonably good game, but entirely derivative of other mechanics in a way that keeps it from standing out in any particular way.

Quick-playing Eurogame. Pick-up mechanism is via a good "place the meeple on intersecting lines & collect all those resources (along the lines). But if you happen to build buildings, your available resources dwindle. Fill boats, build buildings, marketplace galore, as you'd expect in any Eurogame. Pretty. Easy to pick up. Not super-deep but a fun little game none the less.

2017-07-17: Good and tight, quite standard 'Change resources to points' game with added bidding which mostly affect scoring.
To bad it was so LOOOOONG, but I think we played an extra turn (7 instead of 8).
One thing that make the game so tight economically is that whenever you build a building, you have to put it above a resource-creating space. Makes for some interesting decisions.
We played with the 'El Presidente' expansion. I think I wouldn't like the game as much without it.
Seems a bit prone to runaway-leader if someone gets a few good buildings in a combo though.

Initial rating = 6 (would be 7 with shorter play time)

Quality game & game play.  Beautiful board, well made pieces.  Rules clear & well written.  The board is laid out so that most play is obvious and referring to rules is kept to a minimum.  This game has elements of lots of other games, but the combination creates unique play.  I especially appreciate the mechanics that when personal supply areas (crops, mines, etc.) are built upon, your crop yield and building material production is reduced and must perhaps be purchased, but supply and demand realistically regulates prices.  Influence of town officials is based upon voting and can play an important game factor.  Many approaches to winning this game.

A bit long for what it is, but everything works nicely together and feels fresh despite what so many comment about it being derivative.  My only problem is in what I feel are somewhat limited strategies with regard to the buildings.  Since you can only activate so many buildings in a single column/row and so many of the buildings are so obviously paired with another building, you often don't have the luxury of choice once you proceed down one of the obvious 6 or 7 paths.  You can tweak it a little bit, but not much.  That's not a big deal because the game is all about the interaction of the players with the bills, market, and shipping, but if you really had some flexibility with the buildings it would take the game to the next level.  So many of them are so inferior that they never get bought except in the most specific of situations.   

My comments for this one still stand, but I've had to lower my rating since my tastes have changed quite a bit since I last played it.

Yes, it is once again about resource management but this game has some of the best elements of my favourite games.  It's the differences that are important; buildings will cover resources or produce preventing their harvesting, the actions are open to all players and the parliamentary element is a mechanism not used in any of the game's cousins.  I give this an 8 after one play; it's likely to rise from that.

UPDATE 20MAR08:  Definitely a keeper this one, and I'm upping my rating to a 9.  There are more choices to be made than at first meet the eye; do you sacrifice shipping in favour of political power, do you sell produce or ship it, do you build now or later, do you need money or points?  I have to wonder if there is a key strategy under all this, but as it stands there seem to be many varied routes to victory.

after 3 games I'm still not sure about that one. I guess  the gameplay development depends largely on which political cards come into effect. We had fun during the one game  where the cards influenced the market: lot of buying and selling. The other 2 were only so-so. 
And with new players who (for obvious reasons) don't know the buildings yet it will take ages to finish.

...after 5 games: if the market works it's good

update after playing with Expansion: this is a must-have and makes a very good game out of a so-so one.

Yet another resource conversion game that cobbles together many known mechanics. Does that make it derivative? I don't think so. Even though most of the individual parts are familiar from other games Cuba does have its own vibe. The resource production on the plantation, turn order constraints imposed by the role selection, vying for control in parliament, shipping goods, constructing buildings for increased leverage; all these elements have their place and work together pretty well.

My main concern is replayability. Despite the large number of buildings available there is a very small number of obvious paths to go down. You can make a few adjustments as you go along, and much of the game is a lot more tactical than it is strategic, but the general direction is set very early, and there is not a lot of choice. I'm curious to see how that will turn out after a few plays.

I've played this a couple of times now (even before logging my plays) and it's always a nice experience. Biggest problem I have with this game is that there are a lot of buildings and your strategy is dependend on which building you'll want to get.

Great components.

Blind bidding where everyone pays is a nearly universally disliked mechanic - not sure why it's included here.

Similar to other cube-fusion, economic-type games.  I generally find them interesting puzzles but not something I'm clamoring to play.  (Sort of like Sudoku.)  But maybe my tastes are changing - I think I'd like to play this again.

There are many paths to victory, but they seem pre-programmed.  Water, cigars, rum, or heavy-money marketplace-based strategy?

After a single five player game I can attest to the complexity, beauty, and cleverness of this game design.  But it is in no way a better game than Puerto Rico, a game it tries hard to improve upon.  It doesn't and it doesn't because of the "gaminess" of the Worker/Foreman mechanism on the player's boards which requires plantations (products) and resources to be replaced by buildings.  I'm not excited about the blind bidding mechanic that determines which bills will pass into law.  For my money, Puerto Rico scratches the same itch much better. 

After a 2nd play I'm increasing my rating to an 8.  

Picked up a copy for 10 bucks from a member of my game group and sold it back to him for 15 - I had enhanced the game with a plastic organizer.

smooth play. yes, it is somewhat derivative of PR and Caylus, but it is it's own game as well.  not sure why, but i never got into PR...maybe because i caught wind of this site before i dove into boardgaming and noticed the disdain for it among many gamers.  and my preference for this over PR also probably has a little to do with the artwork. this may change from one game to the next, but i never found myself using the market - and i never found the Architect's specialty of getting a VP or two to be much use.

When the nicest things I can say are "there's nothing wrong with this game" and "I'd play it again if someone asked, but I wouldn't seek out a copy of my own," well...

It's an economic/VP engine game with some very nice art, some interesting ideas (the voting/laws system) and multiple paths to victory. However, compared to other recent engine gams (example: Race for the Galaxy), it's a bit clunky.

Fairly tactical Euro.  You build a VP conversion machine, but also go after a variety of opportunities to score additional points, such as fulfilling tax and duty requirements, shipping goods, etc..  A decent game.  The one knock I would give it, is that it doesn't seem to offer much new or interesting, and the building offerings are uninspired.  The totality of the mechanics (card selection, buildings, voting) don't combine to offer good depth.  Still, it's beautifully produced, and a good game in many ways.

2-player rating. Something not quite right with this. Cuba seems to demand long-term forward thinking, and yet holds back vital information to make possible such planning. And with only 6 turns available, it feels like after turn 2, the dice have been cast and we must now await our fate. Even winning is somehow discouraging.

RATING: 7
A lot of different paths to victory through small VP increments.  Havig played a lot of Brass, Pillars of the Earth and Race for the Galaxy recently, and with the comparisons to PR I was looking to build up a VP 'engine' as in those games, but the feel is quite different - not sure how well it is going to compete with the fantastic array of games around.  Lovely bits, but board is a little fussy.

RATING: 8
The number of different buildings and open play make it tough on first-time players.  The core rules are fairly easy to teach, but new players need to know that their first game is very much a learning game.

Update: The game is better with the expansion, but this adds even more open options for players.  In the end, it was neither exciting enough nor unique enough to keep, so it got traded away.  I really wanted to like the game, but it never quite seemed to generate enjoyment relative to the effort.

Cuba is a good and gorgeous strategy game.  The winner is the player with the most victory point.
You get victory point by... Building, converting produce into goods, shipping produces or goods, paying taxes and fees.  You also need to make sure that the laws that will be approuve at the parliament are the one that benefits you most.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Such a a shame but I downrated it from 8 to 7 after several plays. It's a beautiful game but I have some issues. There is a variety of paths to victory but then, there are only about four reasonable combinations of buildings. Everytime I used a mixed strategy I failed. The ships add an imbalance to the game as normal goods (fruit/tobacco) earn the SAME victory points as the trade goods (Rum/Cigars). It's barely pointless to go into that production. However this can be tweaked. But still for the other reasons, the replay value of this game is not very high (unlike Caylus or Puerto Rico).

I found myself pursuing an optimal rum strategy. The problem with the optimal rum strategy is that the cool little rum bottles that come with the game never enter your warehouse before you sell them off!

Rating based on couple of games. It does have a lot of reminiscence of Puerto Rico, but not quite succeeding to be as versatile as PR. Device a strategy right into the beginning and stick by it. There's no room to deviate once this strategy is setup. Some buildings are to powerfull (+2 votes, combining with the anti-curroption law). The Market is stagnent. Maybe our group is the problem, but this game doesn't quite cut it.

The expension El Presidente makes it a whole lot better, 7+.

I like it.  It requires you to be able to adapt to changing circumstances, as it's very likely that at least one of your planned actions won't be available anymore when you get to it.  It's fairly optimization-heavy, but can't be planned too far ahead; that's a mixed blessing.  (I definitely like it better without the rules variant that requires you to choose the person you're sending to Parliament in advance.)

RATING: 7
A role selection and resource management game, which many people compare with Puerto Rico, Caylus and Pillars of the Earth. 

There's multiple ways to score points, and the bills/statutes mechanism adds some interesting randomised factors, which increases replayability. The theme is also very well linked to the mechanisms and the lovely components enhance this as well (esp. the little bottles of rum and the cigar boxes). 

My feeling is that, this is less solvable than other games of a similar weight, and actually much more fun to play.

Really enjoyed my first play and very keen to try it again and test out different strategies.

RATING: 8
Very enjoyable development game; lots of different options and strategies, interesting and difficult choices.

Not as interactive as others, except for the -quite important- 'screw your opponent by taking this action/tile/ressource before him/her, or by voting a disatvantageous law against him/her' aspect. Not short, but not too long either (2 h with 4 players).

RATING: 6
Only played it once so far. Very similar to Puerto Rico which has more variety and a lot more fun. Analysis paralysis set in early on this one for everyone. It was a long game for only 6 fixed rounds, not really long enough to build & make good use of the rum & cigar factories. With 3 players we barely used the domestic market. It has 6 expansions, so someone must like it. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Very derivative of "Puerto Rico", indeed, but that is the least of its problems. Too fiddly, with too many buildings for little variation. Breaking possibilities, for example with the building that gives a player two additional votes and the law that prohibits bidding for extra votes (the same player wins the voting every round). The water strategy is clearly overpowered, with too much gain for very little effort. Also, there is not much room to vary your strategy during the game, which may lead to repetitive gameplay.

It's games like this that meant I was happy to trade away Carson City and degrade the likes of Fresco and Pillars of the Earth on my wishlist. A real head-hurter of a role selection game, this one fascinated me. Clever placement of your buildings seems like it should be relatively simple, but it's an absolute killer - the day I get it right, I expect you'll her me whooping from the rooftops (wherever you are!).

AUG '14: Traded, as I never felt as if I was improving and the challenge remained very much the same - which ultimately became unsatisfying.

Not too heavy, not too light - Cuba is a great middle-of-the-range eurogame.

Does dry a little with repeated plays due to minimal variability (i.e. same buildings, combos and strategies available every game).

RATING: 6
This is a re-hashing of several recent euros, but thats not a bad thing.  I had fun playing the game, though I think its too long for this type of game, there is too much downtime, not enough interaction, and although there are several different strategies to explore, none of them are really very interesting.  The game looks great and has a very strong theme, and is great as a "play once every few years" type of eurogame.  If there was some way to do something to the other players, the game would benefit a lot.  Also, several of the buildings were so atrocious I can't see buying them.  I don't want to knock the game too much because I think it is fun, thematic (for a euro), well-balanced and smoothly designed.  There are multiple distinct strategies you can take in the game, and most of them seem pretty viable.  The market mechanics are interesting but in our game they didn't do much.  Players who had played more than me said they had never seen the market have a big effect throughout the game, it is more situational.  The role selection mechanic was a rehash, and a poor one.  Since each player had their own roles, it lessened interaction.  We started playing our entire turns without waiting for the other players because the interaction was so low, and downtime so high, it seemed the natural course of action.  Normally, I would give any game with rum and cigar tokens a 10, but this one really wasn't up to snuff.  It looks so promising, but ultimately, its a turn the wheel make the VPs pop out game.  A solid design, great components, good theme, but low interaction, high downtime, and ultimately shallow gameplay killed this one for me.

After two plays, I'd say that this is a good game.  It's very much like a cross between Puerto Rico and Caylus (mostly Puerto Rico plus some Caylus-type buildings, without huge special powers).  It's much more forgiving than Caylus -- if you make a bad play early in the game in Caylus, your game could be done.  Cuba gives you options to come back (although building placement is critical).

I enjoyed this title, which appears to be a well balanced mix of mechanics from other games.  Each player has the same 5 "roles", of which he/she will play 4, the 5th being used for the voting phase of the game.

One of the "roles" collects resources/produce for the player.  Another role allows for the  building/purchase of building tiles, similar to Caylus.  Players score points when they deliver goods to the boats at the dock (value of delivery increases the longer the board stays in port).

The 5th "role", which was not played, now acts as the number of votes the player has for the Political Phase, where 2 out of 4 new laws are selected by the winner of the vote "bid" (pesos can be added to bonify your "offer").

All in all, good game length, clear mechanic, has multiple paths to victory (via tile combos, different strategies, etc.).  IMHO, way ahead of PR.

[Initial Impression: 6] Have only played with 2, and it seems clear that it needs a higher player count to shine. Much complexity, but it doesn't seem to quite form a coherent whole. The stock market in particular seems under-developed; perhaps a randomization (gasp!) mechanism there could have introduced a speculation element that would make certain strategies more/less advantageous in a given game. The game plays long but feels as though it could easily continue for even longer than 6 turns. I do like the trade-off of building on top of your resource/product plantations. The game leaves me feeling beat up, but mulling over the experience and wanting to try it out again.

OK, so in some ways it's not possessed of the most original theme or set of mechanics. You're on an island, you're producing various resources which you can sell or ship to get VPs...

But the ways that you do those things are fun, and the parliament system of passing laws to affect the game is really neat. There are many ways to score points, and the initial setup of the game will affect your strategy greatly. I look forward to playing this a couple more times; there's a lot to soak in on a first play.

JEM 13.szám: http://jemmagazin.hu/magazin/page/2/

Minden játékosnak van egy saját ültetvénye,ahol építőanyagokat (követ, fát és vizet) termelhet ki, és nyersanyagokat(citrust,cukornádat és dohányt)termeszthet. Az építőanyagok segítségével különböző épületek építhetők,amiket szintén a saját ültetvényünkön kell felhúzni.Az így elfoglalt területet már nem használhatjuk eredeti rendeltetésére, így gondosan meg kell terveznünk, hogy melyik építőanyag vagy nyersanyagforrásunkat áldozzuk fel egy épületért és az előnyökért. A nyersanyagok eladhatók pénzért a piacon, vagy behajózhatók a megfelelő igénnyel rendelkező hajóra, és ezáltal győzelmi pontokat lehet szerezni. Ezen kívül a megfelelő épületek segítségével átalakíthatók árucikkekké: a cukornádból rumot, a dohányból szivart lehet előállítani. Ha nincs megfelelő épületünk, akkor ezeket a piacon is megvásárolhatjuk. Az árucikkek nem érnek többet, mint a nyersanyagok (csupán a piacon a kezdeti áruk magasabb), de a behajózási lehetőségen kívül egyes épületek segítségével is beválthatók győzelmi pontra.

 A központi táblán található a Parlament, ahol a játék egyik egyediségét adó törvénytervezeteket szavazzák meg. Minél tovább várakoznak a kikötőben a hajók, annál több pontot ér a megfelelő áru berakodása.A játék 6 fordulóból áll, amelyek mindegyikében a játékosok 4-4 akciót hajthatnak végre. Az elérhető 5 lehetséges akciót 5 különböző szerepkártya segítségével lehet végrehajtani, amelyekből minden játékos birtokol egyet. Egy körben az aktuális játékos kijátszik egy, abban a fordulóban általa még nem használt lapot, és végrehajtja a rajta lévő akciót. Amikor minden játékos végrehajtott 4 akciót, az akciófázis véget ér. A megmaradt 5. lapokat a törvénytervezetekre szavazásnál lehet majd használni.

A behajózás szinte minden esetben létfontosságú. Úgy tűnik, ezzel az akcióval lehet a legkönnyebben győzelmi pontot szerezni, de ehhez nagyon fontos az időzítés. Figyelnünk kell az épületek megfelelő leépítésére, hiszen ha jól raktuk le őket, egyszerre többet tudunk használni. 
Természetesen pénzre is szükségünk lesz, áru vásárlásra és a törvények befolyásolásához. 

Elsőre megfogott a játék. Van akinek nagyon tetszik, van akinek nem. Én az első tábort erősítem, ezért is szereztem be, bár messze nem játszok vele annyit, mint amennyit szeretnék.

This game has tons of strategy and the rules are simple.  The game looks great and is of high quality.  So why don't I give this game a 9 or 10?  Because I don't find it that fun.  There isn't a sense of rising action, the 6 turn game seems arbitrary... why not 5 or 7?  I have played it 3 times in 2 player mode and once with 4 people.  The game is definitely better the more people you have as voting becomes a real issue and there is more stomping over people's strategy (aka someone bought the building you needed or loaded a boat full of stuff).

However the game does end with no chance of stretching out from 2 hours to 3 or 4 which is great.

If you like the feeling of winning a chess game, you will like Cuba, because Cuba is a thinking man's game and not a pretzles and beer affair.

A game so obviously derivative it ought to be paying royalties. If you've ever played PR or PotE you'll know exactly what to expect here, but every aspect of this game is weaker than the top rated game that it's so obviously attempting to outdo: crop production, trade, shipping, even the buildings seem less interesting than PR's. Unexciting solitaire. Whatever is it with the games industry and producing something ORIGINAL?

Well, this is very Euro. I wouldn't really call it a worker placement game since it doesn't have an action drafting aspect to the game--what people have referred to as worker placement is just a rather specialized way of deciding what you will produce on your (privately owned) land that round.  

I enjoy the tension involved in putting things on boats and trying to predict when they will launch.  To me, that's the most interesting thing about the game, though I also enjoy the way the harvest works.  I'm not especially excited about the goods market or the laws though. I don't know, it seems like I'm anatomizing the game here because I haven't played it enough to think of it as a whole. (3 plays)

Parece inevitable compararlo con Puerto Rico (PR). Tomando ideas de otros juegos de gestión de recursos, de elección de roles y de gestión de la mano, consiguen hacer un juego con relativo éxito que parece despreciado por el sector duro de la afición precisamente por este préstamo de ideas. Me gusta la mecánica de la votación, según la cual aparecen nuevas leyes que afectan a aspectos del juego (impuestos, subsidios, mercado) y los jugadores votarán con su rol no jugado en la fase (algunos roles tienen más votos que otros). PROS: No afectas tanto al de la izquierda (fallo de Puerto Rico que aquí no se repite). No hay necesidad de memorizar los efectos de los edificios como en Puerto Rico (son autoexplicativos al mirar sus losetas). Versión más "extreme" de Puerto Rico. CONS: Puerto Rico tiende a construir un "motor de PV´s", pero Cuba parece más bien al contrario (hacer el máximo de PV´s en cada momento), lo que le resta profundidad y le hace ser más "oportunista". Hay edificios que parecen no servir para nada como "la cementera" (4 piedras para conseguir 4 PV... pero según las reglas, sólo se pueden conseguir 3 piedras por turno: una de la comerciante y dos por la plantación)

RATING: 7
This game has some familiar vibes, alot of people say its like puerto rico. I disagree, yes you can ship goods for victory points, but there are so many other choices to be made that also get victory points. You have player matts infront of you, but its not just Puerto Rico that uses a player matt. You use roles but these are determined by you, everyone gets the same 5 and uses them in which order they like.

There isnt much interavtion save for an election at the end of each of the 6 rounds. I didnt like the fact the game was over before I could develop a suitable strategy. Having to save enough cubes - 2 or 3 rounds to use a building potentialy 3 times and thats if you want 1 building the second is realised for goes 5 and 6.

I personally felt the game this is closest too is GOA, if you enjoyed that then you will love this.

Bel gestionale, profondo ma non complesso, che unisce vari meccanismi noti a quello, invece originale, della votazione per il mantenimento delle leggi. Molte le alternative a disposizione, ma si riesce a controllarlo abbastanza bene e le partite si sviluppano in modo sempre diverso. Interessante il meccanismo di posizionamento del proprio personaggio sulle piantagioni, con attivazione di quelle poste ortogonalmente. Molto bello e funzionale il tabellone, sullo stile de I Pilastri della Terra.

Fun game.  Comparisons between Cuba and Puerto Rico are fair (e.g., the picking of roles in each turn, producing goods, shipping and selling of goods, buying buildings that provide benefit); however, this is its own game.

Key differences: 
 - The passage of two new "laws" each turn can dramatically influence the game's short-term decision making and improves the game's replayability (i.e., make it less "scripted" than Puerto Rico can be sometimes).
 - Victory points are public.
 - Each player selects 4 (of 5) roles to use each turn and other player's don't receive a benefit from your role decisions.

[Those being noted, given that it does have similarity to PR - which I own - and the game collection is fairly robust at this point, Cuba is just not so unique thematically / mechanically to place it where it otherwise would be on the 'next games to order' list.]

Okay, the game carries a lot of mechanisms, themes or ideas from other games, and is therefore perhaps a little less original, but who cares? It's a GREAT GAME. :-)
I love the complexity and how the game offers so many different ways to collect your points. And you need to stay focussed too, because if somebody steals the starting position from you, they can manoever themselves in a great position to make a huge delivery worth 15 points in the next round. So now: how to avoid this? I like it :-)

What a pretty game; I like so many aspects of it, but a couple things made me trade it away. First, I dislike playing with people prone to analysis paralysis and always try to make my moves reasonable quickly, but this game induced severe AP in both my wife and me, specifically the decision of where to place your piece on the grid on your player board. Also, all the special buildings make for a big barrier to teaching the game to new players, especially more casual gamers.

There are alot of choices.  I find it different enough from Pillars, Caylus, PR, that I will continue to play it.  I like the interesting mechanism for activating fields and buildings.  You really do need to pay attention to where to build.  First game with 5 players, (all new to the game and with rules explained) took 2.5 hours but it felt shorter.  Has some of the best production value I've ever seen; art work is gorgeous, tiles are beautiful and thick, money is thick and large, etc.  Only confusing point for me is why are there some building tiles printed on the board?  Seems like wasted space.  I would rather of liked to have seen a legend depicting which pieces are resources, products and goods.

It's been compared to many, but in fact it reminds _Caylus_ the most.  All these buildings, their abilities and combinations of them...  Role selection is not a new concept either...  But Cuba is original enough to value it on its own.  

This is actually very very solid game in 'resource management & converting them into VPs' area.  It has good potential - several strategies truly exist.

Acts in the parliament is an innovative mechanics.  It has perfectly balanced impact on the game - not too small and not too big.  Great job.

EDIT: Oops...  After 11 plays I'm starting to have a problem with the replayability (even with 'El Presidente' expansion)... :(

Sold.

RATING: 6
Pretty derivative game which  only fares so so against those it borrows from. Less random than Pillars but much more than PR or Caylus. 

Being a 2 hour strategy game I thought the level of randomness and chaos was a little too high here. I am talking about the blind bidding to determine who enacts the laws, and of course the laws do come up randomly as do the ships.  Now normally I don't mind blind bidding but I have a couple problems with how it was implemented here. Everyone loses their money whether they win or not, this just makes the chaotic nature of the blind bidding worse as if you lose even by a dollar you throw all the money you bid away?  Which leads into my next point, second place in the auction should possibly get an action too.  Really I think these laws are far too important to be left up to blind bidding and maybe having money secret with a regular auction might be a better way to resolve this phase? It works fine as is but I'm personally not very keen on it as there is too little control. 

Although I have only touched on the negative aspects I do think the overall game is good but nothing special to be sure, 'just another euro' a most fitting description. Not a game I need to own, occasional play maybe to explore the multiple paths maybe but I won't be requesting it.

Wow, this took a major dive after my second playing. After playing it once I thought the game was very good with plenty of decisions and interesting combinations. But then I played it again and I wondered what I was thinking the first time. It seemed very repetitious and while there are decisions to be made, ultimately the game ended before they could be put to good use. All in all, I didn't much enjoy my second playing very much and have little desire to play it a third time.

Rated after one four-player game.  Yes, the game builds on well-known mechanisms, but it is an interesting game.  Over just six short rounds you have to try and eke out maximum victory points.  Resources get tight and you can't do everything.  The parliment laws make each round different.

Cuba takes many of the mechanisms I love from Puerto Rico and amps them up with a commodity market (like in Power Grid) and stunning artwork by Michael Menzel.

The design is tight and there is a tangible sense of accomplishment at the end of the game.

I only played Cuba once and it was more than 4 years ago, so my memory is a bit fuzzy. I remember I liked the game a lot (much better than Puerto Rico), but in 2011 my gaming tastes were very different to the ones I have now.

Also, now I rate games much harsher that in those ancient times :D, due to this, I’m downgrading Cuba´s rating to a 6.5, still a good game I would like to try again soon. when I do I will come back and re comment on the game.

I remember I liked the role selection and the law phase.

Los tableros individuales son también bastantes atractivos, con la mecánica de colocación del trabajador y edificios en ellos.

Like Puerto Rico but its artwork is better.

Talking about its gameplay I think this game gives you more choices. Laws add more strategy to the final scoring. And if you play it together with its expansion "El Presidente" this game becomes even better.

Players boards are very attractive, there you can do the worker and building placement.[/color]

It does stand on the shoulders of other games that have come before it, but it does so exceptionally well.  It's another resource-management with "lots of different ways to get victory points" type of game.  I like how the bill/statute elements and the boat cards are implemented to make the game more replayable and less algorithmic, which a lot of economic type games have problems with.  I am giving it a 9 after one play, and I anticipate that this may become one of 10s, assuming future games prove out that this design will resist "formulaic" game paths.

This is one of those games in my collection that got played alot when it first came out, now it sits there gathering dust.  It did have some unique mechanisms.

The game did seem to take longer than it should and did not seem to be worth the extra time invested, to be honest.

Well, this is a deep, multi-faceted Euro.  There is a market, and voting for bills, and taxes, and personal farms, and buildings, and cargo ships that need to be stocked...etc...

A lot going on... setup takes a while.  Can cause AP.  

BUUUUUUUUTTT,  with the right group, this is a great game.
The theme is wonderful, the art is beautiful, the decisions one can make are plentiful, and the voting (bidding) aspect is certainly different-ful?  It's a mechanic that distiguishes it from the many other games in Cuba's class-- at least that I've played.

I haven't yet played it enough to knoww whether this will be a keeper in the collection, but the wife is a pure Cubanita, so chances are... it has a permanent home here.

Nice game everything you do has a bearing on everyting else. Not quite sure why It gets called a worker placement game, as you only have one worker. It seems to borrow ideas from all over the place and manages to meld them into a package that is not really like anything else. 

Highly recommended game.

I really am bad at this game but I still like it and its growing on me.  Yes, its derivative - not many original ideas - but it works and engages well with the theme.  The parliament part is neat and very important, opening up many alternate strategies.  The market is well handled, as is the worker/foreman part.  On the first game you will wonder what money is for and then later realise that it is crucial.  There really are a lot of non-obvious choices here.  Plays pretty fast - that's a big plus.
---------------------
Update.  Yes, the choices are not obvious - maybe too much so.  The different ways to get points are so even that its very hard to work out what your best strategy is.

Cuba is a good game (and an undeniably gorgeous production), but exactly how good remains to be seen.

Each player has an individual board with the potential to produce three types of commodity: "resources" (stone, water, wood), "products" (tobacco, citrus fruit, sugar cane), and "goods" (cigars, rum). Resources are used either for construction or, in the case of water, to occasionally squeeze extra production from your fields. Products may be shipped at the harbor for points or bought and sold at market (possibly generating some cash). "Goods" are not actually more valuable (a natural expectation given their position in a production-chain), but they can be vertically integrated into a player's strategy. In other words, "goods" and the associated scoring opportunities are subject to less competition than "products." An odd distinction, perhaps, but certainly a fresh one in games of this genre.

Cuba's foundation is sound, and the designers went to some lengths to build several levels of replayability on top of it. Most prominent of these are the much-touted "laws," which create new scoring opportunities, remove old ones, favor poor or rich players, and tamper with the supply and demand of resources and products at market. They appeal to me in concept but seem curiously tame in practice, and their passage (2 per round) involves a surprising amount of risk. Players who wish to purchase sway in the Cuban Parliament participate in a blind bid, but even the losers pay up. I can't figure out the design intent behind this, as it mitigates the cost for the winner and exaggerates it for the losers.

Player actions in Cuba walk a fine line between juicy tension and dull constraint. Each round, players choose four of their five possible actions, but there are some very strict ordering issues for at least the first half of the game. Ideally, I would want to see multiple good reasons to order your actions differently. Instead it seems like there is surprisingly little to take into account when deciding what order to play your cards in. On the other hand, Cuba contains a novel mechanism for producing commodities and activating buildings. Each player board contains a 3x5 grid of fields, lakes, quarries, forests, and buildings, but players can only activate one 'cross' (intersecting row/column) on the grid. This makes players think carefully about building placement, constrains perfect/efficient output, and mandates specialization, which is further encouraged by the number of unique buildings available for construction.

Cuba is a beautiful game with a lot of charm. There's a lot that looks intriguing but perhaps not the follow-through to match. I enjoyed it and would happily play again 2-3 more times to form a more concrete impression, but I'm not sure it has legs.

Lack of randomness hurts this game rather then helps it.  Too easy for a more experienced player to totally dominate.  Extremely unforgiving.  Legislation mechanic is very neat, though.

RATING: 7
Many good elements.  Too many.  The game becomes a bit more fiddly and brain burning than the payoff warrants.  Produce three categories of goods in a total of eight flavors.  Some help you build (somewhat underpowered) buildings; some you upgrade or sell for money (rare) or ship for VP's.  There is an entire market mechanism that works like Palmyra/Motley Fool, but which hardly gets used.

People go on about the derivative mechanics, but I love the way they gel together and the more political nature of the game.  I would rather play it than Puerto Rico or Caylus because I think the auction phase adds more interest on top of the role selection/building mechanics.

Cuba is a very good game that combines various mechanics into a well-oiled optimizing game with trading, bidding and development aspects. Cuba is the reason I never took the effort to learn Puerto Rico, although I owned a copy.
I also bought the El Presidente expansion, which makes the game less tight, but instead offers more options while maintaining the game's balance.

I have only played this with two players so far and it's not bad. There are a number of possible strategies to play and it is hard to tell who is going to win until all the points are tallied at the end of the last round. But, it is clear that with more people it gets much more complicated and more difficult to understand the different strategies and the ramifications behind each others moves.

Second game was not so good. Again, three of us were close together until the final round but a decision by the fourth player regarding port legislation gave points to the two others and destroyed my chances for the win. What use squeezing out any possible VP when a few points randomly thrown to somebody decide in the end.  
---
Three of us ended with 73 VP and were only 1 gold apart. I experienced such a close end only once before in a multiplayer game with two-digit end scores. It was La Strada and that's a game where decisions don't matter too much. I'm not sure if Cuba suffers from the same arbitrariness or if we just were too opportunistic and not focussed enough. In any case, Cuba is one of these games where each single VP has to be squeezed out. With experienced thinky players Cuba will suffer from AP but can shine in the planning department of setting up your turns for the round. Which role card do I want to keep for the lawmaker phase, in what order do I play the remaining actions, how do I use each single action. Truly multidimensional decisions, hopefully they matter with more experience.

RATING: 6
Initial rating, very likely to change.  This type of game is difficult for me - I usually fly by the seat of my pants, just doing whatever seems best without a general plan.  It works in similar games like Pillars of the Earth, but halfway through my first game of Cuba I realized that I was in trouble.  You really need to focus on a long term strategy to get your VP engine cranking - thoughtful placement of buildings is a must.  The laws didn't have as much of an effect as I thought they would have.  I like the game but it is not an immediate favorite.  I think I would need to get some more plays in to really make up my mind

Update: Somewhat enjoyable while playing, but the voting seems like an afterthought, and the scoring just seems too balanced - the scores are always so close that good play doesn't seem to make that much of a difference.  Ultimately the game feels (and is, IMO) derivative.  I wouldn't turn it down, but don't feel the need to own it.

RATING: 5
A Puerto Rico wannabe which doesn't quite work because of the over-complication. Some ideas were well done, like building over your plantations or the Statutes system. But the 3-tiered resource/products/goods system was just added fiddliness that the game did not need. The limited roles meant everyone pretty much did the same thing every turn and you couldn't stray to attempt a different path to victory. For instance, if I wanted to pursue a non-Building strategy, it just wasn't feasible because I would have to waste my Architect role every single turn (making it my Vote card).

All-in-all, I think the game was too complicated and too long for what it offered. I will still prefer to play PR over this any day.

I've only played 2 player games, but so far have been very impressed.  There are probably many ways to win, but so far exporting rum is the way of choice. I'm anxious to add the expansion and play with 3 or 4 players.
After playing a three player game I can see that the path to victory is dependent upon how many are playing.  My hotel, dam and golf coarse strategy would fail with two players, but gave me the win with three.

I'm not quite sure what to make of this game. It reminded me of "Pillars of the Earth" the first time I encountered it. Perhaps this is because it was a Rieneck/Stadler design. I think the 6 fixed rounds, the market, the converting cubes to victory points, and the flat economic engine all reminded me of Pillars. But to other people, this design reminded them more of Puerto Rico.

After the first game, I thought this was a better "Pillars." After the second game, I wasn't too sure. After the third game, I'm leaning toward liking it slightly better than Pillars.

I think both games suffers from being a bit too long for what it is. The last  game of Cuba I played probably lasted about 2.5 hours including explanation. I would feel better playing a game like this if it was less than 90 minutes (and I guess it could still fall into that time if people are experienced, but Pillars has never really drastically reduced in playtime).

Both Pillars and Cuba looks like a "build your economic engine" type of game, but they are rather "flat" economic engines. In Pillars, the ramping up of the VP points is due to the introduction of more powerful craftsmen. In Cuba, you are building buildings, but each one you build will shut down one of your other production, so the effect of the buildings is damped by the loss of the production. Also in Cuba, the range of the building powers is quite small, they all give you incremental improvements, but none are earth shattering.

One thing I liked about this game was that it was able to accomodate 5 players. However, the game is quite expensive, even coming from Rio Grande.

Update: Reduced to a 5: Not Bad, Not Good, just average. I won and I didn't care. This game just has none of the angst that many other games possess. Also I think the biggest problem is that I don't have to think - Just take the same area, put your buildings down, get victory points, repeat. Dull, Dull, Dull. Pretty to look at but thats about it. I won't be playing this one again.

After 3 plays, I think it is a good, strong game with alot of tough choices.  A little dry for me, and a tad too reminiscent of the games it is somewhat based on (PoE, PR...).
Still, tight, hard choices to be made, wonderful bits/art/board.
I wish the "fun factor" was a bit higher, however.  Loses a point there, imho.

Also, has the potential to go up due to the fact that I know I have not uncovered alot of its secrets in just 3 plays.  has a better chance to go up with a few more plays then down, methinks...

I really don't know how to rate a game like this. I have played it once, but I think I have the measure of it. I think it is a game one can "learn." In other words, there is such a small randomness factor, that a good player should be able to learn how best to play every game, and at that point, every game should be pretty darned similar for him. At least that's how it feels to me. Definitely see the comparisons to Pillars of the Earth and Puerto Rico.

Oh that was fun. Miserable score, but a lot of fun. 5 Player, with only 1 player having played before. So it was new to all of us. There was lots of blank stares around the table after the rules teaching. Which was done by me, even though I hadn't played before.
We had a lot of fun, plenty of table chat, especially when buildings were taken and on the bidding and bill selection. We all enjoyed and all want to play again.

Base Game: Fun worker placement game with some role selection elements and personal building boards. Several paths to victory, but some can get hosed if someone else beats them to a needed building for maximization of the path selected. 3-4 player works best for base game, although with 3, there is often a lot of room for shipping.

Cuba - El Presidente expansion: [rant]Price is ridiculous for this expansion.[/rant] The additional buildings, ship cards and law cards are all a nice addition to add some variety and other game strategies (especially for 5-players. The New Cuban cards and presidential action add a little bit of randomness to the game. Overall, not a bad addition, but not worth the MSRP.

Resource management game with a blend of very familiar mechanisms but the result is not very original. Optimisation of the role selection is interesting and building the combo of tiles to generate victory points is useful. The ships and their different cargoes will ensure variability. Although I like the idea of the voting, this mechanism also makes it very difficult to plan ahead. There are also lots of ways to get victory points, which gives the impression that it doesn't really matter what you do (even a combo isn't really a must). Game play is way too long with 5 players. In the end, the first play was rather underwhelming and a bit disappointing. Confirmed by a second play - nothing spectacular.

The wooden bits reminded us a lot of [GAMEID=31260], as well as the personal plantation mats.  However, [GAMEID=30380] doesn't hold back---it immediately throws you into the full game with all 25 buildings and new laws.  It was almost too much to take in and I wish that there as an intro game setup.  However, everything started to click towards the end of our first game.  There seem to be quite a few different strategies, with many different interacting resources and "engines" that you could develop.  On the other hand, in the long term I wonder if there's enough variety by changing up just the ships and order of the laws each game (will people tend to buy the same buildings each game), but that's something that we'll have to see.

On the plus side, it definitely felt like there was a lot of real decisions to make.  The one thing that it tries to capture from [GAMEID=31260] is the [i]tension[/i]---it feels almost way too short to set up your engine and get it running in only six turns.  On the other hand, the tax/harvest phase is not as intense as the [GAMEID=31260] harvest since the penalty doesn't feel as severe.  Moreover, with just two players the gameplay feels too wide open and non-interactive.  Particularly with two players, there's not too much competition with each other (e.g., it's easy for both players to ship and to buy buildings)---there may be tension over deciding your strategy, but there's not much tension in fighting the other players.  As a result, we've had a couple of runaway leader games where there was not much that the losing player could do to affect the other once they made a mistake that set them back.

In addition, while we enjoyed it, it didn't elicit an automatic "we [i]need[/i] to play this again" vibe like we got from [GAMEID=31260].  Although we found the game pleasant, it's likely to be much better with more players.

Well - it's by no means a bad game but it's SO similar to Pillars of the Earth and Puerto Rico that it's almost criminal... If you had contact with these games and liked them/bought them/didn't like them, then you can pass on Cuba. If you're new to the whole "producing goods and shipping them" and "gaining victory points through buldings/workers" business, then there are far worse games you could end up with.

Yet another 'mechanism in search of a game'. Luckily this one works nicely. Except the rulebook is a lazy translation involving poor grammar, poor word choices, poor organization (including the non-English alphabetical ordering) and inconsistent naming of the same thing using different phrases in different places; blech!

NOTE: Don't forget to put your buildings "in the appropriate places on and near the board". Did anyone read these random words before publication?

We're not the only ones who couldn't tell the difference between a 'playing piece' and a 'playing marker'; no one could think of 'worker' and 'score marker'?

An English translator for the English rules... There are comments online that show even company reps didn't understand the rules when demoing the game.

Nice game where cube pusing and theme are well integrated (like puerto rico). I like the action mecanism with characters. The fact that there is a lot of different resources/goods/material is cool even if all the terms used in game are too similar.

AP player can ruin the game though. With 6*5=30 actions per player, if the same player is taking more than 3 minutes to select its action the game can draggggggggggggg.

RATING: 6
Call it a Caylus wannabe, or Puerto Rico 2, whatever; it's nothing like that.

It has a bundle of familiar mechanics implemented in new ways, and introduces new ones seamlessly. After 3 plays I can say this: It's not earth-shattering, but it's a credit to the economy genre, and one of the best at that.

Perhaps this will go up to a 9 with more plays, but I can definitely say it's no 10.

Update: A solid 7. Too bad the expansion doesn't do anything for this one.

Update: 

Has not aged well in the face of newer options. There are games just as long which are deeper, and others just as deep which are shorter.

It has made a very good first impression on me, despite me doing poorly in the game for the most part.  Lots of ways to acquire VPs, an interesting puzzle-type aspect to the player board (where to place buildings, where to place man for max effect), goods and shipping, with level 2 goods as well (rum and cigars), adding to the number of parts to consider.  The addition of new laws as well makes it hard to take in first time around.  That it may lack as a 2 player keeps it as 'want to play' rather than a wishlist item.

This is a very interesting game.  This game has to be played with non-ap prone people as there are several things you can do and watching people do trig in their heads would make this nice little 90 minute game a bore.  It looks like the developer tried to put a bit of all the top 10 games in this one.  I played a 4 player game and one was a gaming newb and kept making choices that gave him very little benefit but game the leader a huge benefit to get away from me.  I had a hell of a time staying with him.  In the end the two playing against me got away and I came in second with a 20 point difference.

RATING: 6
A great role selection game that is reminiscent of Puerto Rico but with corruption.  Each player has the same roles each turn and can execute them in different orders.  You can build buildings, ship goods and acquire resources.  Then there is a law phase which can changes the rules and scoring in the game.  

I love this game.  It is very under-rated, but you MUST have the El Presidente expansion.  The expansion makes this a very good game.

RATING: 7
In the line of Puerto Rico and Caylus, but not quite as good for some reason I can't quite put my finger on...I think because the turns are limited to 6, there isn't enough time to change your strategy once you have started down a VP path. Also the turns seem to limit some strategies. The game goes on autopilot once you have picked your strategy in the first round. A handsome game but not enough here to make an automatic keeper for me.

A lot of people will probably disagree with me, but [i]Cuba[/i] is the one game that best fits the category of a stunning looking game with no personality. It's a beautiful board with beautiful cards and beautiful wooden pieces including rum bottles. But after playing [i]Puerto Rico[/i] (which could really use a makeover), it just falls flat for me. [i]Puerto Rico[/i] is a tight shipping/building game that has lots of tension, [i]Cuba[/i] has no tension whatsoever.

6/2007 Very nice presentation with lots of colourfull components.  But look more closely and you'll quickly get a feeling that it could have been simplified alot.  There's just too much fidling pieces without much result.  There's little interaction and each round you make a bit more points with just a half decent effort; giving it a hard effort doesn't seem to pay off.  The 6 rounds are very repetitive.

Very nice game, more colorful than Puerto Rico on the same topic. Cuba mixes roles and production, with buildings a-la Caylus, to make it a very nice and entertaining game, much more visually appealing than the PR. The length is fixed to 6 turns, limiting the actions and prompting for efficiency.

A resource management game with nothing brillant to report (a blend of old stuff, but sadly not a particularly inspiring one). It features more uncontrollable elements (ships, blind bidding) than other similar games and features some details (e.g. 8 kinds of goods) that feel redundant without adding much to gameplay.
Forgettable (the "economic engine" idea has already been done better in so many other games).
Nice artwork.

RATING: 7
Good for its time. Today Cuba might be a bit meh, the game feels heavy because you always have to sacrifice actions, so basically everyone thinks they are losing. (Not a feeling to strive fore in a game).

The mechanics are good though and personally my only issue with the game is that everyone will always end up near the same score in the end.

I like the basic role/action selection with the remaining character buying votes, and I like the balance between buildings and resources on your plantation even more. These good ideas do, however, get mired in too much of a muchness; 25 buildings that are all available right in the first round and an acute case of resourcitis kept Cuba from really getting off the ground for me.
Played once.

To me this is like Puerto Rico, 'all growed up.'  Role selection, producing.... produce, and shipping stuff, you can't deny the similarities.  However, the big, beautiful board and high quality components let this one shine.  Having a definite end-time is another big plus.  6 rounds, and it's over.  Nice.  I only have one game in, but I'm eager for more.  However, much like PR, it's a game I'm pretty sure I'm never going to win.

[b]First impression of the game?[/b]
Seems like a good middle-weight game. 

[b]What are the highlights?[/b]
I like the selection system using the grid coupled with the role cards. The artwork and components are gorgeous.

[b]What are the drawbacks?[/b]
The grid system can be a little overwhelming with the choices available which leads to a tendency for some AP.
There is nothing earth-shattering from a game design perspective.

Has a lot in common with Puerto Rico, but I enjoy this one more.  The alternate actions are deceptively powerful. Some of the buildings work really well together.  The statutes can have a huge impact on the game, so buying extra votes can be a great move.  There are lots of ways to generate points, but you only have six rounds in which to build an engine, so it's important to nail down a strategy early.

Must play again - Provisional rating after 3 plays.  Beautiful game, the board and components are just gorgeous.  I expected a more complicated game, but actually I found a lot of mecanism I was already familiar with (like the market for example, reminds me of Powergrid a little), and having played Santiago de Cuba by the same author, we were already familiar with the graphics and symbols.   

Even though this is a game that is a bit longer to play than our usual games (Finca, Stone Age, Kingsburg, etc), all in all, it seems like a pretty strong euro game in wich every mecanism are tied smoothly to the theme, and make you feel like you are farming and trading in Cuba for real. Maybe harder for beginner boardgamers due to the tough decisions, but one or two games and you are all set.

Bought through BGG Marketplace.

On its own Cuba, is a solid game.  The Puerto Rico similarities are really only superficial.  While you do ship in both games, Cuba has alternate win conditions (i.e. rum cafe/distillery, manipulating laws, etc.) that make it such that one can almost ignore shipping completely.  The role selection is also very different.

Rather, Cuba is more like Caverna, where it is a sandbox where you are free to try different strategies at your leisure.  The worker placement mechanic also requires strategic positioning, as adding buildings only decreases the resources you can get.

At 2 players, the 5 rounds feel fairly short.  It's also widely apparent that the 3VP ship is overpowered and that shipping is the only real strategy.  Our fix was to remove the 3VP ship.  Together with the El Presidente Expansion, the game comes up to a solid 7.5.

preliminary ranking based on one play with 2 players. I am pleasantly surprised by Cuba. I was worried of the comparison with PR.

I am eager to play more to discover different strategies and also try more players.

After one 5-player game. Mix elements of Puerto Rico, a smidgeon of Caylus (not too much mind), some voting from any game you care, and the quality of graphics from Pillars, and you get Cuba. Tough choices each turn, lots of interaction, a little visible wackiness. Overall a great combination. [Update] 4-player Hmm, got a tobacco/cigars/VP engine going and spent the rest of the game doing the same actions. OK, I won, but it was rather boring. [Update] OK, I found that we had a couple of rules wrong that impacted the previous game. With the correct rules tonight's effort went down to the tiebreaker, after a very close 4-player game, with 4 points separating 1st/2nd & 4th. [06/03/2008] Hmmm, Caylus, Cuba, Pillars of the Earth, Stone Age? All have similarities, and they're all decent games, but that's my preferred order.

I need to play this a few more times to have a more fair assessment. I like the mechanics and it's straight forward and doesn't take long. However, the Worker vs Foreman activations always mean you'll do one or the other well, but not both, so that limit things. That's intentional, but means that not really much happens so you could get an AP problem, or a luck issue with boat loading. Again, I need to play it more.

- Bribery!
- Strategic placement of buildings is required
- You have to plan ahead for each phase, making sure to play your cards in the correct order for maximum benefit

Very nice strategic economy Game. The game reflects the feeling of having a farm in Cuba through its very beautiful graphics and the good implemented mechanism. The different phases offer lot of variety and player interaction in the game. Maybe some phases seems similar to Caylus or Puerto Rico, but Cuba is a game in its own right. Cuba needs only a little bit more components for replaybility, e.g. more buildings or roles, but this can be solved by an expansion.

One of the best Euros I've recently played. Tried it for the first time at Essen 2007. A very nice game that combines elements from caylus, puerto rico, and pillars of the earth. It plays quickly as well! This may be a future award winner and I don't think I'd play Pillars of the Earth anymore with this in my collection.

One of my biggest disappointments of 2007.  I'm still trying to figure out why I'm so put off with it.  Probably the voting mechanic and all the fiddly personal board stuff (which I admit was intriguing but a puzzle I wouldn't necessarily want to solve each time I play).  I think a lot of people are going to like this one though... it's another in a long line of heavyish engine-building resource games.  2008-10

UPDATE: I won my second play & seemed to have figured it out.  Rating bumped up 1 point.  The El Presidente expansion improves the game.

Very good Euro based on producing goods and shipping 'em out for various points.  I love the Euro production values (mmm... abstract pieces of different colors for different goods!), and the selection process for building/shipping/getting different values is tight.  This one got a lot of play in Cincy when it came out, but haven't seen much of it recently.  Popular for a while, then faded away.

I know some people love this game, but I just don't get it. (2008-04)  And I'll note that the people I used to see playing this have all moved on to other titles. (2011-06)

I played it once and rated it a 4.1, as the game seems to be about knowing and creating a limited number of useful combinations, in competition with the other players. Perhaps I just didn't "get" it. Perhaps if I played Cuba a lot I'd grow to love it. Oh well. Lots more games to try.

[Comment from memory, 2013-12] 
I played it once. It felt far too scripted, because there were only a few combos that really worked, and if you missed out on a key building you could be left with an unviable tableau. 

At the same time, there was too much unique stuff to think about and plan for. Imagine Puerto Rico with three times as many buildings but only one copy of each.

This may be the highest ranked game on BGG that I've gotten rid of, and that fact has made me wonder whether or not I gave it a fair shake.  I tried to like it, despite the tons of mechanics and different features going on (variable turn order, role selection, resource management, voting) but I just couldn't shake that eerie feeling that I would rather be playing "x" or "y" or "z," all of which I thought did what this game did, only better and with more pleasure.  I don't have room for games like this in my collection, so off it went.

RATING: 8
 A fusion of Puerto Rico, Caylus, and a number of other games I like.  Players must obtain resources by working farm areas on their own player board to get resources to buy buildings and goods to get victory points.  This game is filled with difficult choices and tradeoffs, as (for instance) when a player buys a building, they must cover up a production space on their board to place it.  The one downside is that there are about 50,000 different buildings, and resources are limited enough that it seems as though picking a strategy requires a good knowledge of all the buildings (as some make excellent combinations).  This is a neat game with multiple tracks that lead to victory, but I'm worried that it will have a steep learning curve, and that experienced players will always have a major advantage over inexperienced ones.

Demo'd once, played once.  Nice bits, nice presentation, want to like. . . but have nagging doubts.  First up, you have a LOT of latitude on what you do in the game - in fact, there could be a lot more interactivity than there is with the election phase and that would have been better.  Other than that, and some relations on the ships, it's a "play your game of solitaire and after six turns figure out who has the most points" - which, is missing some of those tense moments in Puerto Rico where you are sitting on the edge of your seat wondering what character the person is going to play. . . .Rating most likely to go down instead of up, but happy to try again. . .

Cuba tiene una gran profundidad de desarrollo. La variedad de estrategias exige estar alerta de los movimientos del resto de jugadores, incluso provocaran un cambio en la nuestra. Las leyes y los barcos nos obligaran a abandonar nuestro tablero individual evitando en cierto modo el aislamiento, generando una bien llevada iteración entre los jugadores.

RATING: 6
Cuba looks great. I'm glad Eggert-Spiele is able to do something this cool - this looks like a Kosmos game.

What I like about Cuba: the six-round limit makes the game nice and tight. The decisions can be tough, and doing something means you're not doing something else.

I don't like the way the game can drag. I've played a five-player game that took 2.5 hours. That was painful. With three, I've been able to play the game in less than an hour. That's much better.

I find it hard to pinpoint what's the reason, but even though I think Cuba works, it isn't great fun to play. I have a feeling that with more experience and skill, the game becomes more interesting, but that's always a problem - why should I bother to play this more to see if I like the game, when I can play something else that I know I like.

Cuba is, however, interesting enough to make it possible. At least I'm rambling about it here a lot...

Indifferent.

Okay, a bit of a cross between Pillar of the Earth and Puerto Rico.

Would play again, but not massively impressed by this one despite the very good production values.

Update:

I had played [thing=30380][/thing] once in 2009 where I wasn't overly impressed and again in 2013 where it went over a little better. I wasn't totally blown away, but I didn't feel as though I wasted my time either. To me [thing=30380][/thing] is something of the poster child for an 'okay euro', not one that overly excites but one that is okay and offers a few decent mechanics, some interest choices and has reasonable production values.

There it would have probably stood if it were not for a Sydney based gamer looking to get a bunch of people to group-purchase [thing=30380][/thing] from a local (to him) retailer for AUD$20 each. Well, it sounded like a pretty good deal so after a little hesitation I joined in. I was thinking that the game would make a handy birthday present to Mrs Fish from the Little Fish and event proved this to be true.

Anyway, we tried it out with two players last month and it went over fairly well.  She enjoyed the game and I enjoyed playing with her so that's all for the best.

Hopefully next time we'll get this on the table with more than two. So, worth trying again; I hear it is better with the expansion.

It looks great, it has great ideas, I can imagine that some ppl like it. 
I hate the idea that when I build a building I lose resource production and if I misplaced a building I cannot destroy it and build it on a better place. Additionally I don't grasp it well enough: I always lose, probably because I don't plan ahead well enough, I don't know. PS I do like Pillars of the Earth and Puerto Rico.

Some people complain about the borrowed mechanics from Puerto Rico, Pillars of the Earth, etc. Sure, some mechanics are borrowed, but not the primary mechanic of placing your worker and buildings on your player mat.

I traded away Liberte to get Cuba in a math trade and I consider that one of my best trades to date.

A little bit Caylus, Pillars of the Earth, Indonesia and Container.  The game actually feels a little short.  Just as you are getting your buildings ready for maximum use--the game is over.  If you like economic games, then you should love this one.  If not, then take a fast boat to . . . a Foriegn Island (no wait, that's Container).  The more I play it, the more i feel very constrained in what I can do--6 turns seems too short for this game.  Awards:  Nederlandse Spellenprijs Game of the Year - The Netherlands (2008).

Very interesting and smooth (but to many?) mechanisms, easy to learn.

But there is some lacks IMHO.

I know it's not important for many players but personally, if I can't block player's plans, I don't really enjoy a game.

Cuba is the kind of game when you "can" block player's plans but doing so you will loose more than you gain. So you play "alone", don't take risk and try to adapt from what happen on the board.

I didn't really enjoy this but I can understand many players can think it's a subtle game.

Sure, it's PR and Pillars on steriods, and beautifully produced to boot.  Also reminds me a lot of Goa; there's a lot of game there.  But I just don't know what all the mechanics add, besides more busywork.  I just think that for a certain Eurogame there is a sweet spot where fun and brain work meet.  Too much brain work, and the game seems to sag under its own weight. I think the next round of Euros are really going to have to innovate out of the genre to be palatable to non-Euroheads.  After all, there are only so many ways to ship goods overseas.

Rieneck just does it for me. His games are deep in eurogame territory, yet he understands, that games need streamlining, so as to not feel too mechanical.

Does this game replace Puerto Rico for me? I think so because of one main reason: control! Unlike Puerto Rico, you can choose your roles yourself to fit your strategy but must still take into account factors like the other players' choices, the market prices, the incoming ships, the current laws etc. Additional balance decisions come from which land to sacrifice for a building and which role to refrain from to vote. Add to that simple rules and gorgeous art and you have a perfect game for a summer evening with a glass of rum.

By modern standard, this is a pretty old design (Puerto Rico, Goa, Princes of Florence) in which the strcture of the game is very well-organized (and predictable). 

The competition is there, but not very tense. The game is somewhat interesting, but not as good as those mentioned. The election sounds interesting, but the result is often predictable. The good thing about the game is you need to plan ahead and there's a lot to consider while NOT being overly complicated or extremely tactical that you need to change plan too often - Very good for thinky gamers. 

It is slightly pale in comparisons with the other old classics, however.

A beautiful game, set in Havanna before the Revolution.  Each player is a wealthy family, and although pesos can be traded in the local market and for legislative power, foreign money is the goal for VPs.
Theme counts for a lot in this game. Cigars and rum sit at the top of the production chain, but production only matters if you want it to. There are so many buildings, and each build develops your engine while denying that option to others - but your engine might count for nothing if you can't deliver to the ships destined for export markets and the lucrative US$ cleverly disguised as VPs. Alternatives exist, such as taking control of the legislature for which local pesos will buy the votes you need.
The game plays fluidly with quick turns and little downtime. My only gripe is the end-game can feel jarringly arbitrary. Sometimes that's a blessing.

Only played once, and you can read my session review on the BGG Cuba Sessions forum. I like the variety of things you can do in this game. You have 5 cards you can play every round, but you only select 4 of those. So unlike Puerto Rico, you can choose your Role Selection, and you can often change it depending on what other players do. There's so much going on in the board, yet it was easy to follow, and everything interacted so well. You can build/farm for resources, buy/sell at the market to get money/resources and then you could go to the harbor and ship resources for points, and while doing all this, there's a set of "laws" which can do things like tax or prevent certain things.

This balance of things is pretty cool, and I really appreciated it. The blind auction bribery to the government was a nice thematic touch, and I liked the variety of buildings - I also certainly could see multiple strategies popping up. (Though for games with loads/all of the buildable options out at once, I sometimes wonder if having a subset out would be ideal for replayability and not having a groupthink main strategy)

Slight issues with the game: The players who fell behind early stayed behind as it was an engine game (once you've got a good engine, you stay ahead), so they were just dragged for a 2 hour game that should've ended for them an hour ago. This isn't in every game of it, but I've definitely seen it. I think this could be fixed with more hidden VPs, not a blatant VP track where you can see the players lagging 12+ points behind. Also, the game's board can feel a bit fiddly/cramped with all the resources and things happening, but this is a minor complaint. It can be a bit luck based which ships come out too, so I wish there was a way to bribe the control of that or something. Also, the shipping theme isn't fun to me.

Overall, nice little game, and I definitely like it more than Puerto Rico, I think.

Plays: 2

NOTE TO SELF: Had been considering buying this, but according to what I read, its replayability is low ish, so I will wait and see on this. The expansion adds some variety, alongside the taxes, different ships, and different player interaction, so I may reconsider getting this more strongly in the future.

SECONDARY NOTE TO SELF: okay, after a lot of meditation, I decided not to get this since I prefer low downtime and high strategy so PR just does this role selection better, and its much tighter. The no downtime in PR is huge IMO.

Perhaps a generous first rating, but I liked the weaving of action selection, resource manipulation, and deliveries with new concepts like the spatial importance of designing your fields and the laws that get passed each turn.  Multiple paths, yadda yadda.  Worth at least a few more plays, which is fair praise after one play.

Indeed, 8 was too generous.  But a 7 is fair.

This FrankenEuro owes a debt to Puerto Rico and the tile designers of Caylus, but it also manages to work in a few thematically elegant twists. After one play I can see the strategic complexity of the game... however, it didn't feel that fresh--or as engaging in the gameplay as its forebears. For the time and brain commitment, I couldn't see it hitting the table again.

reacquired two years later. why? compulsive spending

3 (?) years later, finally got a 2nd play in, and I liked it better (but I'm also a different player vs when I first started out). The choices engage, and there is a tension in timing things relative to turn order, with much of the tension resolution coming from exploiting opportunities to flip the script (e.g., saving up for a particular parliament phase, playing the unexpected action card). 4 vs 5 is a big deal; 5 drags. There's a fair bit of AP for a simultaneous selection game. And perhaps some devastating combos, but you can only have one, maybe two. Therein lies the rub: Cuba's tone feels dated; choices come from poverty, with foreman and worker actions in particular neutralizing each other to some extent, and not enough room to do all that much. Contrast this to the contemporary euro feel of abundance in games such as Steam Time or Orleans: so many choices, each better than the last!

A Euro cube-pusher. It's somewhat derivative but does it well; I enjoy efficiency games and this is definitely one.

The spatial and building-over-plantations mechanics are interesting and add tension. The gameboard is very good-looking.

I find that most games tend not to be won on one big, dramatic move, but rather a series of small incremental gains. Personally I find the former a bit more satisfying.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
First impression (4 players): The game looks good and there are several good mechanics working well together. Personally the part I liked most is the way you must build buildings on top of resources and if you want to use them efficiently then you must plan a bit more in advance how to use your cards. Blind bidding where you must pay even in case you lose I tend find a bit harsh as a small part of the bigger games.

Decent game but nothing that hasn't been done before, and done better. The 'place buildings over your harvesting spaces' mechanic ends up being brain burning and frustrating.

Disappointing as I was really looking forward to this one.

Nothing original in this game but the overall mechanisms were fluid and enjoyable. It doesn't scale that good from 2 to 5: more players, more competition on the ships and so alternative strategies (conversion through buildings) are better. First games were a bit the same with no strategy and only opportunism, which I wasn't expecting. Replay value seems low but I hope to be wrong on this point...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Absolutely gorgeous artwork, and the rum bottle pieces are great, too. The game itself is not that original, just the usual exercise of balancing your actions between VP, money, and production, and converting those to each other. The game length of only six rounds seems to imply that you should have a clear strategy already in the beginning of the game, otherwise you just don't have enough time to use your buildings effectively.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
A good game, but one where I believe the expansion is mandatory. Without it, you'd have a fairly "ho-hum" worker placement game, but the expansion adds some new depth without much complication.

Overall, compared directly against Puerto Rico and forgetting for a moment which game came first, I think it is clear that Cuba is the better game (though, of course, at the time PR was more revolutionary).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Good optimisation game with lots options. The parliament system where you bribe the government to pass laws which favour you is a great mechanism. It seems there is a need for strict planning in this game, but as there are a number of back up options always available you can still do well, even if your plans collapse. Although there is a lot to like, I can't help thinking of Cuba as a fuzzy version of Puerto Rico, which in an overcrowded genre fails to stand out.

RATING: 7.3
Gioco molto stretto. Questa l'impressione che ho avuto dopo la prima partita. Il gioco mi è piaciuto molto offre tante possibilità e quindi varie strategie ma la tattica ne risente un po' perché una volta imboccata una strada bisogna perseguirla per massimizzare i punti vittoria. Diverse idee tra cui quella delle leggi che mi ha ricordato Lancaster (anche se Lancaster è uscito dopo). La scelta dei personaggi ricorda un po' Puerto Rico e Rac for the Galaxy. Un gioco nel complesso quadrato, bilanciato e con una buona/ottima interazione. Gioco da riprovare perché la prima sensazione è molto positiva

RATING: 8.5
A sweet mash-up of mechanics, very reminiscent of Puerto Rico, with no real flaws. The 'dodgy politics run by bribery' thematic is hilarious, and the timing of strategies is as complex as I've seen in any game. Being both thought-provoking and fun at the same time is a rarity in any game these days.

Played once more (first play was at Essen). I still like it a lot, and am finding a 'consistent' path to victory elusive. I've seen complaints that 6 rounds are too few, given the time it takes for some engines to get up to speed, but I wonder if that's more a case of not fitting play style to the game rather than the game being at fault. The one thing I really dislike is the resources / products / finished goods distinction, which is a little clumsy and seems to be a cause of confusion among those I play with. But I can live with it - I'm looking forward to getting more comfortable with this one.

Comparable to Caylus and Puerto Rico, but not as good as PR, about the same as Caylus IMO, and I don't particularly care for Caylus. The Power Grid style market was not as dynamic as I'd have hoped, and the commodity prices only seemed to go downwards.

There is some AP with planning your moves, and you have to put some work into the game to learn how to use all the buildings effectively, but I'm not sure I have enough enthusiasm for Cuba to want to do that.

Excellent production quality.

Very good first impression of the game.

Several different strategies can be pursued - as a result, people tend to spend a lot of time thinking at the early stages of the game.

I managed to pick up a copy second hand. Nice artwork and great theme. Has been a regular request in the gaming group until recently.

The game system provides multiple valid paths to victory. All of our games have been very competitive and tight. We tend to play 4 and 5 handed. I wouldn't recommend it with less than 4.

I have looked at the expansion (el Presidente) but can't justify the cost as yet.

A game that works and is well crafted but which I really struggle to enjoy. Firstly, there's a big learning curve with the buildings, meaning lots of downtime until you're familiar with it. Secondly, the decision on how best to place your buildings on your player mat, which will cover up and stop generation of resources and products, is agonizing. It seems no matter how much time you spend, you'll inevitably put it somewhere you'll later wish you hadn't, meaning you spend the rest of the game wishing for something else. There's a strong strategic element required to do well. You need to work how you're going to generate your VP's - shipping, building, what type of conversions, taxes, bills, etc - and how you're going to do them better than the others, usually through strong building combinations and optimal player mat placement. Both of these require serious downtime to get right. There's also a continual requirement for money, so as to influence how end-round taxes are to paid and which bonus cards will be in play, so the decisions on VP's vs money provide a great decision point. So the game has pluses and minuses - lots to think about, but too much downtime, and funnily enough, my in-game regrets end up diminishing overall enjoyment rather than making me feel like I need to play it again to get it right next time.

La prima impressione è un déjà vu: un Puerto Rico riveduto e corretto ambientato ai tempi di Batista. La plancia personale, la collocazione geografica, le navi da caricare: tutto ricorda un gioco già visto.

Ma è solo un'impressione, le meccaniche sono completamente differenti, così come lo svolgimento del gioco. Cuba ti pone in ogni momento davanti a una scelta: godo del privilegio di un edificio e scelgo di rinunciare a una piantagione? Sposto i miei lavoratori per avere le mie risorse o li tengo nell'incrocio giusto per poi far attivare gli edifici che mi interessano? Invio le mie merci al porto o mi tengo buoni i voti del sindaco per vincere le elezioni e approvare le leggi che avvantaggeranno solo me? 

Non potendo costruire tutto, bisogna decidere cosa fare dei propri possedimenti, e il gioco fornisce svariate possibilità: produttore di materie prime, manifattore di beni di lusso, commerciante o politico cittadino. 

Ciliegina sulla torta - sia per meccaniche che per ambientazione - la fase delle leggi: il momento nel quale il giocatore che più ha "investito" se la gode e "si sistema" le leggi come meglio crede.

A tutto questo si aggiungono una dotazione e una qualità di materiali notevole e una grafica molto sopra la media.

Un bel gioco longevo e divertente, la cui scatola merita un posto nello scaffale a fianco del suo più illustre predecessore.

I really liked the how the positioning of stuff on your player board works... sure you can build lots of buildings to get nifty abilities, but then you won't produce as much raw materials.  The buildings themselves allow for many different working strategies, though the iconography can be confusing, and the sheer number of options can be intimidating for new players.  I generally like the flow of the game, though I'm not a big fan of the blind bid in which everyone loses their money.

Tentative rating after one play. Beautiful game of Puerto Rican descent. 

Our group really went separate ways in our initial impression of the game. Several negative voices where heard regarding play time (long), down time (insufferable), non inventive (Puerto Rico, Caylus plagiarism) and, the most serious complaint, too restricted.

I on the other hand kind of liked it. There's a lot of subsystems to digest (buildings, shipping, market) during the first play, which I believe accounts for concerns regarding both playing time and down time. The "nothing really new"-complaint I can fully understand, but as I'm not super fond of either Puerto Rico or Caylus this somehow seems to hit a sweeter spot (further plays will confirm or revoke this statement).

The "restricted" complaint I believe emanates from the basic premise of the game, which you either like or not. I see Cuba as a three step rocket: 

1. Early game (2 rounds) Pick a primary and a secondary strategy. Pursue the primary one. If thwarted by other player's actions (choice of buildings) or own mistakes (bad building placement) switch to secondary strategy 

2. Mid game (2 rounds) Perfect your engine. That is, build and trade according to the chosen strategy. It's now more or less to late to switch horses.

3. End game (2 rounds) Make the engine run at full speed. Try to squeeze as much juice (VP) out of your citrus fruits (or whatever your strategy is based on).

Based on this reasoning one can see that in Cuba one makes the grand choices and have the most freedom in the beginning of the game, just to have one's freedom more and more limited as the game draws to an end. During the end game, the choices should be more or less obvious. 

This leads to a very unfulfilling experience if you expect success = more choices (but remember Cuba is a communist society =) ): One'll end up looking for grand moves during the end game and get frustrated for not finding any. If one knows what to expect and works with the flow of the game, the experience will be improved (and playing time and down time will be shortened).

First play: Beautiful artwork, components and gameplay provide a strongly themed time in the Caribbean. Many mechanics are familiar and engineered together for smooth, almost simultaneous play (unless you really want to follow what you opponents are up to): role selection and the order in which to carry out 1 of the 3 possibilities provides much of the decision angst, more so when the 1 role you can't play goes towards voting for control of rule breaking legislation which will hurt/benefit players. Such roles allow you to load ships for vps, or to dabble in the marketplace to sell and buy. One refreshing aspect is the activation of your plantation: you receive resources (for buildings) and produce (for shipping and the market) from the fields along row and column that your worker stands; erecting buildings on your plantation (to generate all kinds of production/vp/financial benefits) covers what you can harvest. So a game is laden with dilemmas and trade offs, and the brutal bribing for the votes can be anxious (if you lose you still cough up). But for my tastes there are not enough secrets on the island as all information is open, except for in-the-fist bids and what your opponents are thinking, so lacks the climatic reveal I like in most designs.

RATING: 7
An okay second tier game with no wow factor, which immediately reminded me of Puerto Rico and Caylus, because major elements from those games have been lifted. However, Cuba is inferior to either of those great games.

The components are nice and overall it is not bad and I certainly will play it again. I suspect it will be more enjoyable after a few plays.

As in Puerto Rico, there is a role that lets a player ship goods for victory points. This role is called the "Mayor".  I guess calling it the "Captain" would have been a little too blatant!

The voting on Bills to become law is an interesting mechanic, but it is too small a factor to free the game design from the yoke of PR/Caylus duo.

I love how open this game is. Lots of viable strategies. Extremely colourful which will appeal to some people but distract others from the mechanics. Wanting to try out different strategies makes me want to keep playing this game, although I suspect after 10 or more plays my rating might go down. Strategy is important and 6 turn limit makes each turn VERY important. Unforgiving to newbs. Bidding at parliament is an interesting idea but often only 1 or 2 players have enough reason to risk losing the bid for them to bid more than 0.

RATING: 8
Very intuitive Euro.  Rules are simples to explain, because it has similarities to Caylus and Notre Dame.  Deeper strategies not apparent immediately - requires additional plays.  Great looking board and goods.  Worker-goods to Mayor-ship strategy seems overly strong with 2 players.  Suspect replay value due to little randomness.

At first play appears to be a bit like Puerto Rico although i have never played that game. After a couple of playes it seems to me that the game ends too quickly. Apparently the expansion increases the turns from 6 to 8 so I hope to get that soon and see if it improves the game.

Strategy important from the very 1st turn, little room for error as the game ends in 6 rounds.  At game end it feels as though you are just getting started and could use a couple more rounds (much like Puerto Rico).  Tight scoring between players makes it interesting.  Mechanics seem like a blend of Caylus, Puerto Rico and Pillars of the Earth.

RATING: 6
Played with the [thing=40794][/thing] expansion, as was advised to me by lots of BGG reports.

This is a perfectly fine game that just didn't catch on with me and my group. 

The general idea is you start with a board full of production spots, and a hand of symmetrical action cards. Each player in turn chooses a card from their hand and resolves it's effects, or if playing with the expansion, you can resolve a minor effect from one of the cards in the display at the top of the board. Players use their action cards to produce, build a building on top of a field, activate their buildings, ship goods to boats, or buy/sell at the market.

The building tiles are quite limited. Having buildings gives you 2vp per building, so there's reason to have them, but only a few buildings convert lesser resources into greater ones, which means a big way the game expects you to get them is through buying and selling in the market. I like the tension of when a player chooses to play what card, and I like how in the end of the round, all but 1 of your cards will be played, but I've been spoiled by engine building games to think that I want my later turns to have built on previous ones, and that's just not the case here. You do however, have to be very aware of what other people have so that you don't set them up too much to get points.

An odd mechanism is that once the action phase is over, you bid for event cards to resolve. Players do a secret bid where everyone pays if they win or not, then you add the number on your unused card to tally your total votes. The winner gets to apply 2 of the 4 event cards to the event space, and then you resolve them from left to right. Money isn't used for much outside the market, so I guess it's ok to pay for a losing bid that has no effect, but it feels strange. I also imagine that some amount of prediction of what's likely to be selected, and then plan for that contingency is a key part of doing well at this game.

I think there's more that I could learn in terms of understanding this game, but the core experience wasn't very exciting, so I'm not inclined to put that time investment in. The game has an adjustable length from 6 to 8 rounds, depending on how many events you pack in, but what you do on your turns each round feels a little too samey to keep me invested.

Nice tight, well balanced, game of building, managing, trading, and shipping. Draws elements from other popular games and adds a twist to each.

Role selection from PR - but each player sets their own sequence

True supply & demand market

Shipping - Each ship takes a mix of goods and progresses over time to higher value and then leaves

Variable rules - votes via card and blind bid bribes to determine who selects/changes half the laws/taxes in that turn

Individual player matts - buildings go onto your resource squares and activation of buildings and collection of resources are based on placement of common marker which makes for a puzzle solving aspect to your own board (PR & PoF joined)

First play is a bit confusing as to the tactics required to implement a strategy (while trying to figure out a strategy). Will need a few more plays to see how many viable strategies are possible.

There seem to be far more tiles than there are strategies; perhaps there should be tiles 'sets' based on number of players. The player boards are too small and limiting as far as builds and the game is too short to do more than have a 2 or 3 building engine operating (and once that engine starts, just play the same cards for the final 2 turns). Perhaps 1 of each of the 3 products can be permanently stored for 'free' and/or the Foreman can Activate all ADJACENT (non-diagonal) Buildings at once, encouraging more building but also grouping together. The luck of having shipping opportunities may unbalance the game.

Money, at least, should be hidden.

Update: Slipping towards a 5.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A difficult game to play.  It is too easy for your plans to be undermined by the player before you.  It would help if everyone got a game-aid detailing all of the buildings - it is difficult to plan your actions when the building counters are on the opposite side of the table or upside down.  You need to have a plan rather than taking random bits in the initial set-up.  Overall, a bit too low on the enjoyment scale for me.

Now played with the expansion which improves the game.  But a decent player aid listing all the buildings is still needed to help planning what to do and to speed up the game.

Now played with a print-out of the buildings, but it is still difficult to formulate plans with too many options to weigh-up on every player action,  And plans are easy messed up by other players.

RATING: 8
Can a game with cigars & rum be all bad?

Definitely a blend of mechanics from several other games - but with its own flair. 
Has the competition to get the shipping - wait you get more points at the risk that somebody jumps in front.
Buildings help you process resources and can provide victory point paths not available to other players.
Has resource allocation - do you ship raw products or use them to make more finished goods.
A voting mechanic to change the costs and how certain victory points are awarded.
Each person has 4 different actions and 5 actions to choose.

Which ever path you choose, need to watch the other players so they don't choose a similar path.

The game looks to be vulnerable to the heavy analysis where you come up with the "perfect" plan

RATING: 8
This is a big, slightly messy, extremely lush board game with lots going on. It does feel somewhat derivative of other games, as has been noted elsewhere, but not necessarily in a bad way. There is an interesting tension going on as one is forced to cover over one's sources of basic resources with buildings as you get your victory point engine running. The different laws coming into play are a nice diversion. I especially like the use of the five various role cards. Each is quite handy each turn, but one must weigh when to use each one to its best effect. I am quite happy with this game.

A pretty heavy euro-game, not because the mechanics or concepts are much deeper or more complex than other euro-games but the designers clearly had no intention of keeping it focused and simple and added lots of different things that go on at the same time. The game could have worked with 2 out of 4 of the present core mechanics/engines but then it might have been whole different and much lighter game. I do like it, although I think there could have been more variety when it comes to the buildings (random order) and events, but what gives. A good game and gorgeous to look at.

In the game of Cuba you produce goods at your lands, you trade the goods and construct buildings.
I like the actions cards and it's planning element. The way you have to deal with your territory is also cool, if you build a building you have to build it over a production area. The game really looks fantastic!

Played once.  Seems like a big jambalaya of other game mechanics. Mix Puerto Rico with Caylus, throw in a few extra Eurogame features (blind bidding, voting on bills affecting all players, marketplace to buy and sell goods, and special powers) and you have Cuba.  While it was enjoyable, it just seemed like more of the same, nothing new or exciting.  Very, very pretty though.

RATING: 8
Definitely a thought buster and one that takes a few games to really get to know what you are doing. New players will find themselves struggling behind anybody that has already played it, and can be very unforgiving for bad choices in the early game.

That being said, this is a very elegant game. There are several different mechanics going on here, but they blend in nicely. There are different strategies that can lead to victory, which is good, but you have to watch out that a player doesn't lock themselves into a lead too early on that you can't break them out of.

Too similar to other games out there to really warrant a lot of attention from me. I've tried to play a few times, but always end up getting board and would rather play Caylus or Puerto, the two games it is so obviously trying to combine, than waste time playing this weird hybrid. Going to be happy to trade this one away.

I played it once so far, bought the wooden box at the Spiel 2007 in Essen this year.

I love the role selection aspect of Cuba, and especially the way that the selection of each role has variable affects on game play.  Role selection will determine what transpires in the game, who goes first next round, how many votes a player has in the last phase of the game among other things.  It still gives me the sense that I'm building something that I enjoy from Puerto Rico and Agricola.

But I guess I'm a sucker for role selection.

I'm reluctant to label this "Worker Placement" because the placing of the worker is one action in a snowballing chain of VP-fuelled engine-building, but "Worker Placement" is important.

Terrible rules translations can be found all over this game. So bad that certsin tiles are easily misinterpeted as imbalanced or broken. Once you know what every tike is AUPPOSED to do, there is a nice flow to the game. Everyone has the same hand of cards, all useful, but you csn only use so many in one round and getting the biggest reward for each actuon requires careful planning. Afterwards, there is a neat voting round which introduces new rules that change the rules of the game and how players score points, which helps keep the game feeling fresh on every play. I especially recommend the game with the El President expansion.

RATING: 8
A fine eurogame, with elements familiar to players of Puerto Rico, Caylus, and Pillars of the Earth. Rich choices, many paths to victory, and absolutely beautiful boards and cards. Felt like multiplayer solitaire the first time we played, but this is an illusion: while the player interaction is only in the form of taking opportunities that others might want, it is constant and surprisingly vicious. The more we play, the more we see in this game. Highly recommended!

What makes Cuba so interesting is that, despite its similarities to Puerto Rico, it maintains it's own identity. Making points is easy, but being truly efficient is not. For example, where PR's quary is a clear as day means to reducing the price of a building strategy, Cuba has no such clear cut system. and that's a good thing

Some devaluate this game on the grounds that it stole and mashed up mechanics from different popular games. I say it's great because it took and integrated mechanics from different games which which were great to begin with, into a very nice and complete economical and engine building game. Different possible strategies to win, nice board, a lot of player interaction, once in a while an interesting gamble on other players actions. And some hard-core passing the initiative decisions.

I'm not a huge fan of games featuring a spatial element associated to how you build your own little corner of earth, and Cuba is no exception.

There are some nice elements in this game, such as your own game board that you can use for building. When you build you gain something from your building, but you lose one product when you 'produce'. At the same time the game has some downparts as well. The market (buying and selling products) is hardly used, it seems that it doesn't pay off to go for the luxury goods and when you are behind on the score track, it is very difficult to catch up.

RATING: 5
The board and the rules are great. I really like to play it with a solo variant (e.g. rolling a D6 to show how much corruption each player spends), but with people it gets very boring. It's more like chess, and even though I like chess, Cuba isn't as fluent. Every desciscion has to be thought out, which makes it of course great for strategical hard core gamers, but not as great for people that want to have fun interacting with each other.

While you may find some aspects of other games in this game, Cuba itself is a very deep economic game. Involves LOADS and LOADS of strategies and possibilities, very good game, I enjoy it quite a lot :)

So much promise, so much fail.  I really, really wanted to like this game.  It has beautiful components and has been compared to the great Puerto Rico.  But, there are only a few viable strategies if you want to win the game, so you feel like you are playing the exact same thing over and over.  I want variety, I want surprises... I don't want a rum VP engine.... or a water strategy.  There's just no replayability here.

--Feb2008-- One play with 5; it seemed very chaotic.  Despite the fact that it really seemed to me like a bunch of mechanics in search of purpose, I'd still love to try again with fewer players; both 4 or 3 should play distinctly differently than with 5.
--Nov2008-- Not too bad with 2.  It might need more plays before dismissing it.
--Aug2010-- Traded away.
--Jan2017-- Not remotely missed, either.

I find the mechanics in this work just fine and I even see the worker placement / resource placement idea to be kind of refreshing if not pretty darn smart, but overall the game seems like a lot of work...  not enough fun.  I also don't like that the shipment strategies are very hard to plan for an can often swing score higher than I feel they should.

RATING: 5
I found this game to be a very hard game to get into. There are too many unique buildings, and right from the start you have to look at all of them to decide which one of them you want to build on the first turn. Of course you might not build the first turn, but probably more than one person will, and they will get in eachothers way and slow the game down alot looking at all the tiles. I suppose it might get better if you play it enough to know it really well.

Feels like a good game, but haven't played with more than 3 players yet so the options have been quite open (Cuba does not have a scaling mechanism for different numbers of players). 

A few doubts (of which the El Presidente expansion fixes the first two but makes the third one even worse):
The endgame is narrowed down by decisions made early in the game (a bad start may ruin the game).
Some of the buildings seem to be red herrings.
Trying to analyse all the options leads to heavy AP and down time.

I understand people who compare this game with "Puerto Rico". But that's only regarding the agricultural path. There's also a really nice part in which players vote about new laws that interact with their plans. It's a lot to do in this elaborately designed game ... for example purify resources into cigars or rum. Unfortunately the game seems to end just at the point where players could start their engines in an effective way.
I'm looking forward to finding and trying out the expansion(s).

A nice euro combination of some of my favourite mechanics and an interesting theme. 

Unfortunately, I don't think the game lives up to its (written) promise of many different facets and paths to victory, as it quickly becomes apparent there are but two main paths, but it's still a jolly good game and the two paths are broad, allowing for a slight difference in approach.

Sort of your standard produce resources and ship them for points type game, with a decent balance in the different paths to victory. It is reminiscent of Puerto Rico in some ways.

Ok -- so I'm a rules guy.  But I've never played this game -- the rules don't quite explain the set up, and I never got past that point.  I want to learn this game, but sadly will need it taught to me, or it will never see the light of day.

I own it, and it sadly sits in its box, hoping one day will be the day it comes out and actually stays out.

Today is not that day.

RATING: 7
My type of game: pretty, over two hours, lots of options and strategies and interesting choices, requires careful planning, with enough interaction to force you to watch other players closely but almost no screwage. I'm not an expert, but it seems to me that it's [b]very[/b] hard to change your strategy after the first round. This means that, with few players, if most choose to compete with one another in the production of goods while one is left to himself, he's very likely to win.

RATING: 7
This is probably not a game that I would have ended up buying were it not in the famous £7.99 sale at The Works. To date I have only played it two player - for which it is absolutely essential to use one of the variants for dealing with the ships, something I find a little annoying design-wise (that the game requires some tinkering to scale for fewer players, and that this didn't seem to be picked up on in play testing.) 

But this is nonetheless an enjoyable and challenging game, with an interesting range of strategies for players to explore (all of which must, however, be undertaken with the understanding that this is a game which very quickly reaches its end stages).

It feels quite different from Puerto Rico to play, in spite of superficial similarities.

A good strong game that doesn't play at all like Puerto Rico or Pillars of the Earth/Caylus despite sharing many of the same thematic ideas and the fact that these other games have a board, turns and game pieces. Enjoyable time planning a potential strategy and then modifying it to cope with the changing laws and taxes. Managing your player board and cards while keeping an eye out on what your opponents are doing keeps you well occupied without bogging you down though. There should be some good replayability here exploring new ideas. A bit concerned that only one dam can allow one player too much of a lead in water resources, but strategies seem well balanced. A couple of rules questions regarding tiles. Great production and artwork - lovely looking game and functional too.

Another one of my favorites.  I only gave it an 8, but it becomes a solid 9 with the El Presidente expansion, which fills the few gaps from the base game.  I like to call Cuba a "sexier" version of Puerto Rico with a lot of different elements to it - bidding for votes, main actions, secondary actions, buildings, shipping.  Despite everything going on, it is very intuitive and easy to pick up.  Also, it has a 6 turn limit (bumped up to 8 with the expansion) so it isn't going to drag on forever.  Little bit of learning curve to get familiar with the buildings, but nothing major.  An excellent game that I look forward to getting on the table more in the future.

Cuba (Rio Grande) -- Played twice; four-player.  

I [i][b]want[/b][/i] to like this game.  

After all, there are so many truly cool mechanisms involved.  To name just a few: the use of the un-played character card to augment votes; the changing of only two of four statutes per round, with the possibility that some may stay in effect throughout the game; and the decrease in production necessary to place a building, whose power still requires activation.  

The mechanics all fit together well.  The theme is incorporated throughout.  The artwork is quite pleasing.  And the components are top-notch.  

I find it easy to respect this game.  I just haven't managed to enjoy it.  It feels more like I'm trying to overcome built-in obstacles than like playing against the other players.  And perhaps most importantly, it doesn't feel like play.  It feels like work.

RATING: 1.5
Final verdict time. Well maybe not yet. There is a tiny glimmer of hope, but here's what I got: 

This is the everything but the kitchen sink euro. Its supposed complexity is being born more of player's confusion trying to find their way out of this mish mash of mechanics than any actual depth. The game used to annoy me a bit, being a MPS and a confusing game in general. Then I left it for 2-3 years and we recently played it with other games from "cuba trilogy" and after many soulless euros this one had a certain charm and promised space to explore and strategies to pursuit. So I tried it solo to see this space. It turns out this is mostly a tactical game, trying to gain advantage of ships and voting in the parliament, [i]however the game's mechanics are far too opaque and needlessly convoluted for interaction between players being able to shine through[/i]. There are just too many pieces of this puzzle that are situational (depending on laws being in effect) and/or too arbitrary.

Cuba was a gift from my 2011 BGC Secret Santa, and I have played 10 games of it – with half of those plays being with the El Presidente expansion – before putting it up for sale with little regret. The best part of the game for me lies in the plantation grid. It’s a unique minigame of positioning the lone worker to activate resource slots and buildings, and there are tough trade-offs over which resource slots should be replaced. 

The rest of the game, however, is met with mixed feelings. I love how the law system captures the seedy undercurrents of politics, but the requirement for [i]all[/i] bids to be paid for is a huge disincentive for most to participate in the process. ([thing=96913][/thing] implements a similar law system more successfully by requiring majority votes for a law to pass.) There’s also a lot of visual clutter with 23 unique buildings crowding the table. Some of this clutter is unnecessary, given that a good third of these buildings is far too niche to see proper play. 

But my biggest beef with Cuba is that it’s just too long for what it is. It's a game of opportunistic plays – most of the VP gains are incremental, and there's minimal control over what goods are in demand. Ideally, such a game should wrap up quickly, but Cuba outlasts its welcome two-thirds through. Bummer. Even the cute rum bottles and Menzel’s sunny artwork can't salvage the middling gameplay from the shuffle of more current Euros.

Egy látatlanban beszerzett játék. Szabály alapján nagyon megtetszett, a kivitelezés pedig pazarnak tűnt. Ez utóbbi teljesen igaz a játékra. Minden eleme nagyon jól kidolgozott, tartós. A tábla gyönyörű, az épületlapok szépek. Szóval a kivitelezés szinte tökéletes. Egyedül talán a törvénylapok szövegei helyett lehettek volna ikonok a nyelvfüggetlenség jegyében, bár mivel kevés van belőlük nem nehéz megjegyezni. Földművelő gazdákat alakítunk Kuba szigetvilágán, akik épületeket építenek, terményeket termesztenek, ezeket esetleg árucikkekké alakítják, amiket behajóznak. Ezzel lehet győzelmi pontot szerezni, illetve a különböző funkciójú épületeket által. A játékosok egy kör alatt az 5 fajta szerepből 4-et választanak ki, amelyek meghatározzák az adott kör alatti cselekvésüket. A termények és építőanyagok megszerzése egy jól kigondolt mechanizmuson alapul. Gazdálkodó emberünkkel a 3x4-es saját területünkön az adott sorban és oszlopban levő földeken termelünk. A játék igazi újdonságát a politikai rész adja. Pénzbeli és terményadó, illetve valamilyen győzelmi pontot hozó törvény mellett a negyedik a piacot és egyéb dolgokat befolyásol. A törvényekből kettőt a legtöbb szavazattal rendelkező játékos változtatja meg a forduló végén. Ezek a rendeletek nagyban befolyásolják a játék menetét és megszerezhető győzelmi pontokat így nagyon fontos kinek sikerül ezt a 6 fordulóból álló játék közben többször befolyásolnia. Jól működő játék a Cuba, mégse nyűgözött le. Ennek én fő okát abban látom, hogy több játék keveréke és egyedül nekem a politikai szál hozott újdonságot, de tulajdonképpen hanem is így de megjelenik ez is más játékokban. Alapvetően egy Puerto Rico hasonmás, de egy kicsit bonyolultabb, illetve szebb. Jó játék a Cuba, érdemes kipróbálni, 3-an is jól működik. 5-en talán elhúzódhat, de szerintem akkor sem vészesen. Nekem nem okozott katarzist, kiemelkedőnek nem éreztem, csak egy jól összerakott játéknak.

This is a really lovely system.  It is, of course, very much a Euro, as it ultimately is only about Victory Point accumulation, and yes it stands on the shoulders of giants.  But, it really doesn't feel like other games.  The system is taught and the number of options available to you all seem engaging.   As you move your machine forward you must destroy what you were initially given, this is all about setting yourself up to create production loops.  There are a number of ways to get yourself in a position to get ahead.  The game is a reasonable length so that as you are burning up your resource board or pushing the market or money you know that there are only six turns so you really are ramping up your game quickly to get as much as you can out of each turn.  

The shipping works well, and the laws are fun.  I like the simple market and the production grid makes for some fun choices.  The art is beautiful and intuitive and it just is a joy to play with.  As soon as you are finished you want to try it again to try out a new strategy.  

I can see my rating going up for this with a couple more plays.

First impressions: Was introduced to this game by a person who indicated that I'd like it because it was similar to Puerto Rico. Well, yes and yes; liked it and it does bear certain similarities to Puerto Rico, i.e. plantations, goods, buildings, shipping, a trading house, role selection. But it has something else and it's a quality that I can't quite put my finger on. Yet. I've played it exactly once and was thrilled to have finished in the middle of a five-player pack. Not sure whether it was my capable instructors or the relative simplicity and elegance of the design but I was able to engage almost immediately, whereas with Puerto Rico, I don't think I was fully engaged until I'd had about a dozen games under my belt. Yet, in some ways, Cuba is a trifle more complex. As with PR, the richness of the experience is bound to improve with repeated plays, for a lot of the same reasons - getting to know the buildings and the ways in which each of them can impact play, understanding the roles and how the order in which you play them affects play. Unlike Puerto Rico, all players are in possession of all roles and what matters is the order in which you play them.There appears to be more to learn in this game than Puerto Rico, if you can imagine such a thing. If being in possession of "x" amount of information at any given moment in time is critical to successful PR play, with Cuba it's "x + to-be-determined" amount of information; again, first play. But I liked it A LOT. First game of three on an evening with gaming group and when I got home, its patterns, decisions and thinking processes were with me as I drifted off to sleep.

There have been comparisons to PotE and rightly so, but its a much more advanced engine builder with elements from lots of other games weaved in. There a hints of Puerto Rico with role selection and Caylus with building types. There is also the shipping element from Guatemala Cafe and a personal board for mining resources, harvesting products and laying down buildings. For some reason, that reminded me of the market from Hermagor as you align your worker on an X/Y axis. The most unique feature of the game is the Parliament. Every round new Bills are proposed to affect Taxes, Subsidies, Market etc. Depending on whether or not you win the bid at the end of the round you can affect a total of two of the four laws. Its a really great mechanic and actually brings the theme together in this Euro. I really felt Communism was in effect.

I was underwhelmed by my first play, perhaps because it may not be the best 2-player game.
I haven't got it to the table, since. I don't know exactly why not. Perhaps that's what happens when you have a lot of games and a first underwhelming experience.

I find this to be more fun than Puerto Rico.  While it would seem initially seem like this is mostly solitaire, since you all play with a common set of buildings and special actions, the order in which you take your actions and what buildings you construct, and when you ship your goods you construct really affect others.  I found myself really enjoying planning out which actions I had to carry out and in what order.

RATING: 6.6
Beautiful game, which bears much  resemblence to both Puerto Rico and Caylus. This might be its undoing, as whilst the game plays well and is undoubtedly elegant, you cant help but compare it to both of these heavyweights and feel it might just fall a little short. Having said that, I feel that with repetitive plays one would get over the comparison and as you become more familiar with cuba you will enjoy it for what it is.

Some clever elements and some frustrating elements.  While I enjoyed puzzling through the resource/building grid, I found that once I solved the economic problem, I just did the same thing again and again.

It's a good game although not good enough to play very often especially because of its playing time. It takes a bit too much time than it should. The mechanics are not very original instead they look a lot like others used in different games (Pillars of the Earth, Puerto Rico).
But it is a good average game that could be played now and then.

Played with 5 players. I've rated it lower because this time I've found it to be quiet annoying. There are so much more games that are funnier than this one that I'll only play it once or twice a year tops.

After playing solo, this would have been a 6 or so, and very possibly up for trade. After playing a couple of 2 players with Liz, though, it's gone up in my estimation - really enjoyable, this, and good to-and-fro-ness.

EDIT: Since Oct 2012, I've actually done a simplified version of this with only worker, foreman and mayor, with Emma. Was quite fun, but she got a bit bored other than loading ships and working out points (cigars/rum - or rather chocolate and juice - got double points).

Rating based on one play. 
I can see what people mean when they call this a cross between Puerto Rico and Caylus. Although it definitely has a different feel from those two games (and other games it's been compared with), it did not provide anything new for me. That doesn't need to be too bad, as I don't consider originality in games very important (I mean, how original is Puerto Rico, anyway?). For me, Cuba's biggest drawback is that it takes pretty long (it's up there with Caylus), but it doesn't make you feel you are actually building towards something. There's not this 'engine' your working on, like in Puerto Rico. Caylus also doesn't have this engine, but at least you can work towards certain goals, like building the prestige buildings (which takes some preperation). All this is lacking in Cuba. You collect resources, spend them for points, and repeat that forcess five more times. Because of the lack of progress, the sixth round feels pretty much the same as the first.
I'd like to play this again to see whether my judgment will change.

How is this game like Puerto Rico.  Both are islands in the Carribean. Both grow crops on plantations.  Both grow sugar and tobacco.  Both can ship sugar and tobacco for victory points.  Both can build Buildings that let you do cool things.  Both give you victory points at the end of the game for your buildings.  Both have 5 characters you can pick from (the prospector is NOT a character just Cash)both have characters that allow you to ship, work your plantations, let you build buildings, and sell your goods for cash.  But that is all the similarites the two games have.

This game has lots going on, so if you like that type of game (think Caylus, Puerto Rico, Age of Empires III) then this is for you. The choices you get range from deciding if you are going to try and get goods on a boat; what 4 workers (out of 5) you will select to use and in what order. whether to go for the votes in the parliament bills which influence the game (using the influence from that unused worker mentioned above). Whether to try and build a  building and when you do where to place it on your resource board (as it reduces the amount of resources you can get).

Overall a very good gamers game, with lots of re-playability.

Despite comparisons, the game stands on it's own feet. I liked that VP earning is significant from the start (rather than the usual earn cash/resources then later earn VP routine). I liked the way you had to consider who might be doing what, and in what order: balancing your "ideal" sequence of roles against a less optimal sequence, but one that insured against other players doing things that might seriously inconvenience you. More interaction than I was expecting from reading the rules. Keen to play again soon.

Fairly interesting game with a lot of paths to victory. Some of the mechanics feel weird (all buildings available at start makes it hard to grasp what to go for) and possibly not completely balanced.

My first game was pretty tight, although I played with 3 others who had played before. I went the anti-shipping route (except for shipping on the first turn to block someone else), using VP generator buildings and veto power to constantly keep the "gain VP depending on your last cards political power" and just never using the Mayor. That combined with getting just enough money and goods to pay for the taxes kept me in the lead the whole time.

Feels like a more complex and better version of Puerto Rico.

Despite the game's beautiful artwork, the designers should have spent more time polishing the game mechanics before releasing Cuba.  Six turns are not enough to get a decent return on your investment when you construct a building.  If you build a building after turn two, you will be lucky to use it two times.  More than half of the buildings are simply a bad investment and should never be built.  The designers released a "fixer" expansion a few years later for 3/4 the price of the base set.  No thank you.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Cuba looks promising, but could have needed a lot more time in development/testing.
It seems to offer many options to the players, but in reality you just choose one strategy in turn 1 and then repeat almost the same actions for 5 more turns that take way too long. You cannot switch strategies or adapt to what your oponents are doing.
Balancing could be better, too. Usually the player who managed to ship the most goods also wins the game because other sources of Victory Points are either very minor or largely unpredictable or both. And who gets to be that player is also largely dependend on chance.

Still a fun game and theme and material are nice, but gameplay seems unfinished.

RATING: 7
Familiar elements from Pillars of the Earth, Caylus and PR, but the recombination is well done and fun. Too many choices and too little variety between games with all the buildings available.

[u]My Rating Explained:[/u] Very good game. I love to play it.

[u]Verbose Assessment:[/u]

Ok, let me get this off my chest: this is NOT Puerto Rico. I agree that it looks & feels much like it, but game play is totally different.

There's role selection, but you only select for yourself. The interesting thing is that the cards you [i]don't[/i] play are also important for turn order and for voting bills in parliament.

You can construct buildings, but only 3 or 4 each game. Which ones you buy is extremely important, as well as where you build it: each building will eliminate one of the resources or products you can get.

Also, the flow of play is very different: you have to be very careful to not get cut off, and if you get cut off, find a way to cope. It just feels more cut-throat to me.

The politics are interesting, with votes being important but bribes making the difference. Money is hardly necessary, but handy in parliament and often needed to get points by paying your taxes.

Playing Cuba is hard work, but fun and always a nail-biter.

Still have not had a full game!  2 half games.  I like this game.  It has a decent flow, but gets a little APish in parts.  Knowing the game would alleviate this problem. I'd like to explore the different strategies but it seems like their is never enough time(like Agricola).  Which is unfortunate because there is a good game here. 

update : Two games tonight.  This game has a tension from start to finish.  Every move is critical to your success.  Strategies rely heavily on the buildings you choose which put you on an all game path to work on.  Very far in advance planning is required.  There are, however, small instances to grab VP's with short term planning.  These come in the form of the laws and shipping.  You definitely have to inch forward point by point because each point you eek out of the system will help you.  The game feels short at 6 rounds but after a couple plays you can get an engine going pretty quickly.

update: I reacquired this and we had some fun doing it again.  In the end it just showed it's lacking two player and was traded out...again.

I rated this a 9 earlier but some small details have made me change my mind and lower it to an 8.

a) It doesn't seem possible to use a market strategy, i.e. produce stuff that is expensive, sell it and buy cheap stuff to ship, the market fluctuates too fast.

b) I want a more thematic harvest limiting mechanic.

c) The boat manipulation powers are a bit lacking in my opinion, I would rather have had manipulation of single good types on the boats than to swap ship at sea with ship in deck for example...quicker and easier to grasp.

Other than that, a fantastic game :)

As others have mentioned it is certainly a merge of Puerto Rico/Pillars of the Earth/Caylus and it does a good job of cherry picking from them.

Not the easiest to teach due to its multi-layered rules but we got a good feel for it after the first round.

When buying it at Essen 07 I hoped it could be a 9 or a 10. But so far it is not.
Players new to the game are overwhlemed by the huge amout of options.
Most games offer some options to you in the beginning and more during a game.
Concerning Buildings Cuba offers ALL options to you in the beginning and fewer during the game as other player have built the uniqui buildings.

Excellent. I had bought this on a whim as it was fairly cheap on ebay, and on the suggestion of a geek friend (Hi Tracy!), and it is a heavier euro than I favour nowadays. I have too many games that I want to play to keep going back and mastering the subtleties of one particular game, so although I enjoy meatier games, they are not currently my fad. Cuba however just comes in under the bar. Enough to keep you occupied but not a precise science where one mistake ruins you for the entire game. However was playing with 3 other noobs, and the chap whose game it was being forgiving to us I think, instead of caning our backsides for sloppy play!
Good - will definitely play again, and happy I own it.

RATING: 3
I'd like to try it again. My gripes with this game are (a) you seem to need to plan your actions a long way ahead of time, almost from the start and (b) all of the buildings being available from the very beginning is intimidating to new players.

UPDATE: Played it a second time and downgraded it to a 3. I really dislike this game.

RATING: 7
Place market-fresh copies of Caylus, Pillars of the Earth and Puerto Rico into a casserole dish, layer with a bidding/vote mechanic for some meta-game rules, sprinkle in a pinch of salt, mix thoroughly and bake at 300 degrees for 40 minutes. Presto! Serve your new copy of Cuba hot with favorite side dishes. Leave the beer and pretzels in the fridge - you won't be needing 'em. This game is deep and meaty. Tough one to teach because of all the "stuff" going on, but players pick up the mechanics pretty quickly once play begins. May take a couple of games to figure out which buildings work together well. Only a couple of quibbles: the rules-auction mechanic is pretty brutal, with all players who bid paying regardless of whether they win; and the water strategy may be a bit overpowered. I like this one very much despite some very small flaws.

First off, the board and components are very nice.I've only played one game, but there didn't really seem to be any real reward for having gone for the premium goods.  It seemed like I would have been much better off going for something other than rum, since it wouldn't have been as difficult to produce and trade for VPs.I'd be willing to play again, but I'm not going to ask for it either.

Played 3- and 5-player. This is a very complicated game for the first game and a half. So many decisions, resources/goods/products and buildings to become familiar with. There may not be enough viable strategies to keep it interesting, but it is good for a few games at least.

Cuba is Puerto Rico meets Caylus, with just as much complexity as either but far less natural rhythm.  I'm a big fan of Michael Menzel's artwork and Cuba is visually delicious!  It's a strange hybrid that doesn't transcend the sum of its parts, which are many indeed.  But I love it anyway.

Not a very good game with 2, plays much better with 4.  Though I enjoy Pillars of the Earth just as much (which Cuba is somewhat reminiscent of), Cuba gets more table time.  Well designed with multiple paths to victory.  Not very innovative, yet still enjoyable.

UPDATE:  Played it for the first time in quite awhile--2P.  It's still not a very good game.  No real surprise there, but I seriously did not move my worker the entire game.  Not even once.  I just got my engine rolling and cruised.  That's not a whole lot of fun.  Thinking about trading it, but I know Caron loves this game.

Tried it...tried it again...and again. Still doesn't click with me. Think I should sell/trade it. Real estate on your personal board is scarce, board options basically pushes everyone in the same direction with the same action, which you can't take based on turn order. If exports are easy to fill, everyone will do that...otherwise it's rum or cigars (depending on exports) until the price is pushed down and then you move to other buildings depending on the bills/taxes. Haven't seen a main focus on steering the votes win...not my kind of game.

RATING: 6
Liking this so far, although a bit heavier than most games I usually play. The gameplay is pretty simple, but there are a lot of things to think about each turn (especially with the expansion). Having all of the buildings available at all times is just too much to consider.

Update: After a recent play where I grouped the buildings according to building costs, the game was a lot better. It was easier to get a feel for which buildings were available and for what cost. Also, a two-player variant from the forums where you only use two ships helped to improve the game.

Update: Decided to get rid of this after some more plays. Puerto Rico and Santiago de Cuba give a similar feel, but for me those are much better games. Cuba is just too long and has too many rules for the experience it provides.

Cuba feels like the predecessor to the "hand building" mechanism found in more recent games like Lewis & Clark and Concordia in that you have a hand of action cards that you need to properly sequence each turn. Unlike in those newer games, however, you have the same hand of cards every round. This makes Cuba an incredibly flat experience with minimal growth or variance as the game progresses.

First Impression:
A classic euro with some interesting mechanics.

The game is close, the theme does its work and players feel the fullfilment of growing their estates. The parliament mechanic is excellent.

The roles are not balanced nor varied enough. Now that has no effect between players, but wastes the role selection mechanic that could have been excellent. The ships are also too restricting and may end up unused because of that.

I'm still not sure about this, but I did like it the first time.

Don't know why I haven't managed to play again after my first go, because I'd like to.  I think there are just too many other games that I'm too excited to get to the table that this one gets left behind.  Someday I'll get back to it, I'm sure.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A different take on what is essentially worker placement and victory point gathering. The five role cards are well balanced. There is always a hard decision as to which one will be left out. Having the role cards influence parliament votes is clever. Cuba has many paths to victory, many of which I'm sure will be explored in future plays. My one criticism is that it seems to take too long for what it tries to achieve.

SOLD (September 23, 2010)

After 2 plays of Cuba, I can certainly see why everyone is calling it derivative and unoriginal, but I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing.  I liked how easy it was to learn and teach Cuba, given that everyone had played Puerto Rico and Caylus before.  I think it's different enough to be worth playing and exploring the strategies of Cuba, and it doesn't hurt that the game looks great!  Although, while Caylus and Puerto Rico are 9's for me, I can't really justify giving Cuba more than an 8 at this point, then again, that's not too shabby at all, and I am certainly looking forward to a third play, hopefully soon.

Upon playing this for the first time, I was told of a player who won with an "all water" strategy, meaning she had bought the dam and the golf course.  I kind of backed into that just to keep others from getting water, but soon realized that after 5 turns, the most victory points I could score from it was 20 (4 water conversions to VPs x 5 rounds), so I ended up having to try and catch up by growing tobacco to convert to cigars for shipping.

I'm calling B.S. on the water strategy.  And I also don't understand why you can only fill up one ship at a time.  Why not take the easy points to keep someone else from scoring more down the road?

A fine euro game, in which I really like the way the personal boards work. It is clever and, because of it, the player has to make some hard choices - where to put your tiles is as important as which tiles to take. And I like games that have a spatial aspect.

Everything in [thing=30380][/thing] works well together, and it allows for many different strategies. The only thing against [thing=30380][/thing] is the sheer volume of good euro type games in the market - it is hard to find a place even good games like [thing=30380][/thing], so, it stays out of our attention and the games rotation.

The game is pretty as I come to expect from Michael Menzel.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Probably avoiding this due to the resource acquisition being based on individual player boards with a spatial component and no interaction occurring there. Looks like as in World Without End the player interaction is mainly in snatching up limited opportunities; action selection itself is not inhibited.

Who can send the right delegate to parliament in order to influence the government legislative process, or erect distilleries, hotels and banks at the right moment to the benefit of his village? Whoever has accumulated the most victory points at the end of the game, wins.

Very thematic for a cube-pusher.  Passing laws to change the rules is a brilliant piece of work.  

The overall design may leave something to be desired though.

That is, a fairly clear set of 3 or 4 strategies might emerge that sapped the fun out of it.

A number of people are complaining that the game doesn't provide direction and they just wandered around the game space. This strikes me as more the fault of the players than the game. This, like Puerto Rico and a number of other games, is not a game everyone will be able to play well the first time through. We managed to put together coherent strategies and execute them fairly well.

However, after several games I lowered the rating a notch - I still like the game, but am not sure it will have quite the longevity of an 8. It might go back up.

Good economic "resource allocation" game that plays very well with the maximum number of players (five). Most of the turn actions were used in other, similar, games, but the the way in which you "activate" workers and buildings is quite novel, and requires some serious consideration. If this game appeared on the market some three years earlier, it would be a no-brainer to purchase it. Now, however, you should only consider it if you feel there is a gap between Pillars Of The Earth (less complex, more random) and Agricola (more complex, less random). I like those games a bit better though: POTE is more streamlined and Agricola has a better integrated theme and less downtime. Personally, I therefore have no need to own it.

The selection of roles, building combinations and voting mesh together pretty well.  After reading the rules we were totally confused, but after the first round we had a good idea of what was going on and were already cursing our first round action choices.  

One thing I didn't like was that there are only 6 of each of the laws.  It helps make keeping track of the 6 rounds easy, but would be much better if there were 18 of each, and 6 were used for the game and the other 12 of each put back in the box before the game starts.

Definately has a feel similar to Caylus and Puerto Rico, but I think I like Cuba better than both of them.  Of course, that could easily change with time.

I've played twice, and I simply am not convinced that there's fun there.  The experience is dry and boring, and I have my doubts about the balance of the buildings.  The game hides any balance issues somewhat with so many moving parts and such high number of mechanics.  This same complexity meant that I didn't even start to understand until well into our first game.  If that criticism wasn't enough, I just don't know that there's anything here that is unique.  It feels very, very similar to any other cookie-cutter Euro.  Sure, it's beautiful, but is that enough to save it?

Wow.  Cuba is Puerto Rico reimagined.  The trading house is replaced with a power-grid-esque open market, the captain ships require certain types of goods, but you can only load one....it's a very different game with a familiar feel.  There is still role selection, but everyone chooses from 5 roles for 4 turns, and your choice applies to only you.  Activation of buildings and production is different.  It's Puerto Rico, but much different, and possibly better.  Certainly heavier.

It has a similar flavor to Pillars of the Earth (which shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone), with some more interesting things going on.

There seem to be lots of choice in this game, but after a few plays, it's not yet clear that the game is well balanced; in my first two plays, the same strategy was unstoppable, leaving the end-games of these plays less inviting than the mid-games. Still, quite fun, and the rating my revise upwards with subsequent playing.

Cuba prior to the revolution: Under turbulent circumstances, the villages of the island strive for independent wealth and influence.Who can buy and sell his products and goods on the domestic market profitably or take in the most on the trading ships?

Who can send the right delegate to parliament in order to influence the government legislative process, or erect distilleries, hotels and banks at the right moment to the benefit of his village? Whoever has accumulated the most victory points at the end of the game, wins. Players earn victory points by shipping merchandise from the harbor, but also by erecting and using buildings, and by abiding by the law.

Finally got to play this, with 5 players at Drexoll's.

A good game, althjough our session went a bit long.  There was a bit of undervaluing the blind bidding portion,  which let me control the flow of points.  A bit of denial interaction with the boats,  and some turn order positioning aspects - it's not too hard for the last place player to guarantee first place next turn,  if they save the mayor or the foreman it seems.  A bit of planning ahead aspect as you want to save some actions for later (for turn order),  but sometimes you want things to happen earlier (to sell at good prices/ship before others).

Lots of different buildings,  and laws - but maybe a bit too much variations - too many paths to victory that all end up being the same?

While everything in this game is done well, there just doesn't seem to be anything new here.  Produce cubes (and other shapes), turn them in to build buildings and generate victory points.  It gives me a large feeling of deja vu.  Also, for me at least, it was missing that special something that added a bit of charisma to the game.  Also, the last turn or two (out of six) feel anticlimactic, as you can't build any buildings that really make a difference.

I played only one 3-player game, and it's very good, but I have some reservations. In our game, one player managed to get a lock-down on the whole political aspect of the game, and I don't see how this could NOT happen most of the time.
Also, the mechanics are not very original. But the game works so well that it's not really a problem. I'm looking forward to playing it again. And again (probably)... :) 

UPDATE: Just got a 4-player game under my belt, and although politics were less a problem this time around, I'm still not sold on some of the mechanics. But I'm willing to play it again, so I guess it's a good sign.

promising start, good during most of the game, annoying end. A swing of 17 points in the last round depending who was able to select the laws.

For completely different reasons to Santiago de Cuba, I have mixed feeling about Cuba. I really wanted to love this game. It looks nice on the table and the style of it is my cup of tea. After my first experience being taught the game (which I won largely by ignoring shipping of good) there was mostly positive feedback to share about the experience. I enjoy games where you can focus on specialising in a particular strategy or doing a bit of everything. In Cuba there is plenty of choice for which way to take your operation. The simple market mechanic for tracking goods works well (similar wooden token economics to Archipelago and Archon: Glory & Machination) as does card role-based action selection. There is quirky auction bidding system for settling rewards/benefits dished out at the courthouse. My two gripes are one big and one small. It is a modest inconvenience when shedloads of tiles or cards are splayed face-up at the beginning of a game. Annoying this is the case with Cuba. To properly engage with a strategy in the game you need to look at all of the building tiles at the beginning and work out what they are all used for. There is no text on the tiles only icons, so referring to the rules or another player for a translation is necessary. My main problem with this game after an adequate number of  plays is the functionality of the operation board. It has an abstract quality to it, based on a "crossroads" action selection process. I hate it. You need to overbuild locations on the operation board which cancels out the availability of the covered spots. There is decision making required here at a planning level where the future of the game is not yet clearly plotted out. In planning terms, if you make a move then you're bloody well lumped with it for the rest of the game! There is no room for adjustment or redirecting your efforts whatsoever and this detracts from the enjoyment of Cuba.

This game is good, an interesting mechanic however there is little room for error.  You buy the wrong building at the wrong time or put it in the wrong place you have no chance of winning, and no fixing your screw up.

As millions of others have pointed out, Cuba is a mix of Caylus, Pillars of the Earth, and Puerto Rico. I knew halfway through the rules that I wouldn't like it, as I no longer have any need to play games that revolve entirely around (1) resources and (2) buildings that turn resources into VP or other resources. I won my only play of Cuba, and I plan to die undefeated by never playing again.

Way too many bits for a euro and a little intimidating but there's decent gameplay underneath. Seems like you need to come up with a good strategy right off the bat and run with it. I noticed picking actions felt a little scripted at some points once the engine is running. Rules need a bit of work too. Cool idea and I like how the market and bills worked. 

Things went a little better on the second play. I'm still not crazy about the idea you practically need a strategy worked out going into the game due to unique buildings. It flowed better and still played well at 2.

God, this game is gorgeous. It may be one of the few games where appearance WAS a major factor in purchasing it. That said, there is still a lot of game here and feels a bit like playing a Eurogame Mixtape. I like the legislative elements. The mixture of mechanics keeps Cuba from feeling as competitive or solvable as Puerto Rico. My friend likes to play it when he's burned out on Puerto Rico but still wants to get his game on.

Beautiful game. So many ways to achieve VP. You must consider what to do first and what after that. Combine the buildings and watch for the ships coming in the harbor. make an action before someone else does it, or find another solution when others are ahead you. A game with tense until the end.

After playing it with "El Presidente" expansion there is no reason to avoid it again.

I love games that have that classic euro feel and this one just feels like an instant classic because of all of the smooth mechanics.  The idea of playing card abilities in a specifically chosen order to counter or beat your opponents to a resource, building, or get a priority on shipping goods is outstanding.  You can tell that many more recent games have used mechanics and design ideas from Cuba.  Any game that has relatively easy to understand gameplay with deep strategic and tactical choices is going to get the best praise from me.  This game really delivers and it'll be fun to continue to explore all of the nuances this game has.  

A lot of people compare this to Puerto Rico, and while I see the comparison, to me it feels much different and is definitely the better game though I know many might disagree with that.  The artwork is stunning.  This has got yo be the best looking game I own or very close to it.  I am still not sure if certain buildings are overpowered, but it will take time to explore all of them and I really look forward to that.  I am eagerly looking forward to this exploration in Cuba and to sometime try the expansion which is supposed to make the base game a lot better (hard to imagine that).

Oh, This is superb.. Like a good friend of mine said, "any games that has small wooden cubes are good!" It's rather tactical than strategy.

But i guess that's the beauty of it..I WANT IT!!

RATING: 6
Having no expectation prior to playing Cuba, I can't exactly call my experience disappointing.  However, I could safely label it underwhelming.  With the exception of the initial placement of your first building, the rest of the game played out exactly as I had planned from the start.  There was very little tension, no hard choices to make, no need for a plan B.  Each round repeats itself by putting your worker to the field, then activating the buildings so I can turn my product into goods and finally to victory points.  The other two actions oscillate between either grab a free product/resource or buy/sell at the marketplace; and construct a new building or grab the straight VP.  I never shipped, and very rarely did I use the mayor for coins.

The taxes, while interesting, were implemented poorly since they provide everyone the same opportunities to score, and did absolutely nothing to adversely affect the players if they cannot meet the criteria.  The only downside to disregarding the laws is the missed chance in scoring, which can be easily made up if you have a good engine going.

Cuba plays way too long for what little new mechanisms it offers.  Uninspired and repetitive, I quickly turned down a second invitation for another game of this.

On my opinion should have a better rank in the geek list. It's very balanced. The only negative point is that you cannot do everything, the buildings are limited and the resources too.

This game is often compared with Puerto Rico and Caylus. After opening the box, I can understand Puerto Rico and aftre looking at the building tiles, I can understand  Caylus. But what most comes to mine mind, is Santiago de Cuba, but bigger and more components. I think that’s because we played Santiago de Cuba several times, and it’s called the little brother of Cuba. Cuba being it’s bigger brother means that it’s more full-grown, or it will be more complex. We like Santiago de Cuba very much, so we had big expectations of this one.

When you’ve played Santiago de Cuba a couple of times, getting into Cuba shouldn’t be a problem at all. The basic mechanisms of these game are the same. And probably that’s why, why we were playing this game within 30 minutes after opening the box and punching out the tiles. The game uses a lot of different mechanisms. A free market, elections, shipping, worker placement, resource management. Enough mechanisms to make this a complex game. I don’t know why, but it isn’t complex at all. The different mechanisms make sense. Only the market isn’t used very much. The different laws that comes into play, makes that you’ll have to adjust your strategy during the game. Every victory point that you score will be important, because , at least when playing with 2,  at the end, the score will be close to each-other.

This is not a game that you want to play with your family, but with some more experienced gamers. People who want to think over their next step. It’s not Puerto Rico, neither it’s Caylus, but this is a great game.

After 2+ Plays: Just bored by this one.  With only 6 rounds, there isn't enough time to do anything interesting.

Building game with a Cuban atmosphere. It feels a little like Puerto Rico. Looks very good. Plays smoothly. You can vote laws which alter the game, which is a good thing.

Some laws can screw or make the game for you so there is a little bit luck in that. But overall I like this game very much.

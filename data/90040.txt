Dig this. Pretty light game overall, especially once you've played through it once. You're doing set-collection, but an interesting bidding mechanic that ties together how "deep" you can dig and how much money you get adds some interesting risk calculations.

I think the theme really adds to the game; I love the interplay between bidding for digsites, collecting artifact tiles, and using a museum for scoring ties everything together nicely. The components are very well done too, the scoring tickets are gorgeous, and all the bits n' pieces feel super-high quality.

RATING: 6

LIKE: Interesting bidding mechanism. Like the theme. A bit of player interaction competing for certain pieces and pushing others out of scoring brackets.
DISLIKE: Dry! Difficult to get to the table, and could use a little gaming depth. Some components are hard to distinguish.

OVERALL: Players don't seem interested in this one, but I think it's fine when it gets played. It's a light, quick game with fun little mechanisms that work.

RATING: 7
Nice and solid bidding mechanics which makes you balance between greed, pushing your luck and playing safe. This is really the meat and the most interesting part of the game. Then there is the AP inducing part when you assemble the relics into an exhibition, as fitting the pieces together is kind of a puzzle.

I would say that the only weak part of the game is the scoring and the upkeep. Determining the value of the exhibitions is not crystal clear every time and the inflation in their value is easy to miss during upkeep.

What Andy Parsons said. You can win by combining one haul from gallery 5 with three tiles picked up previously, so the other 13 rounds wouldn't be important. Requirement for player input is low.

+ Push-your-luck mechanic of funding combined with the set-collection of artifact pieces meld quite nicely to make some tough decisions.
- Perhaps a bit on the simple side for its length.


Why it's previously-owned:
Didn't fit a niche for our group.  Wasn't heavy enough for regulars, wasn't quick enough for gateway/filler.

PROS
- Great components like the thick tiles and very colorful board
- Press your luck with money vs. When do you want to dig part of the game really makes for some great decisions
- Player interaction in how much money you ask for and who goes after you
- Your new exhibits pushes your opponents older exhibits closer out the door which is fun
- After teaching, the game rolls smoothly and rather quickly
- Lots of depth for a game that is "light"
- Very funny when someone gets screwed out of money or better yet, you get the leftovers of money and it's a lot

CONS
- A vase symbol has a light or dark side so it gets confusing on whether or not they match
- End game rules for polishing means you can use up all your money to polish all you want. Thematically, it doesn't really make sense since you can only polish 3 times max during the rest of the game. It's a little "game-y", but not the biggest deal.

The risk/reward mechanic for claiming grants is about the only interest in Pergamon.  Still, I agree with Uwe Rosenberg that freakish results from it can decide the game.  Otherwise, Pergamon is simple set collection with a couple of timing issues to ponder.

The artwork is quite pretty although the two halves of one jug are harder to match than they ought to be and the numbers on the grant track are too small for these ageing eyes.

Rahdo does it again. After watching Richard Ham's play through of this game we have spent the better part of a year trying to get our hands on it. Finally got it in trade and it was way worth it. Basically a set collection, bidding game. Now normally we don't like bidding games but this one is simple since you just place a marker along a row to try and see how much $$$ you can get to dig up relics from the excavation site. In a two-player game a dummy player vies for $$$ and relics as well but this dummy player system isn't as clunky as the "Free City" in 7 Wonders. Liking it a lot!

Arghh, another great game I've only discovered after it went OOP. I like pretty much everything about this, particularly the tension at the start of each round that means the sooner you go, the less money you get. The jigsaw style of the ancient finds is cute and thematic - I assume they're two broken halves buried in different places in the sand. 
There are interesting balancing acts here, such as the balance between speedily getting small exhibitions to the museum or building up larger ones, or buying the oldest relics at a high price or less valuable newer ones more cheaply.
Play length perfectly suits the game weight and the element of luck in deciding the initial money available each turn is nicely pitched. Production values almost over the top, like the lovely but completely unnecessary different designs on the victory point tickets.

Heavier than it seems. It lasts about 45 mins but it is a lot more strategic than it seems on the first play, or by reading the rules. It also contains a fresh "push your luck" interactive mechanic that works very very well. It is also a great production. Other games with small duration but deep strategies I can think of are Glen More and Notre Dame. This goes alongside with them.

RATING: 6
A quick set collection type of game.  Nice on how you have to balance money, asking for money along with what you will be able to actually excavate.  Towards the end of the game some very tough choices had to be made.  Speculate on how much money would be available.  If you can get the cash.  Stuff like that.  Game looks very nice and the set collection is different as you combine pieces, puzzle like.  Another game i want to play again and I feel the rating will go up.  Did I say it was quick?  That was the icing on the cake.  It definately doesn't overstay it's welcome.

I expected less after the boring Finca from the same autor, I don't know how much Stefan Dorra is here, but I like the game a lot. The funding mechanic, turn order and where you're able to excavate are really good interconnected.

Overall, Pergamon is a fun family game that can please gamers. Not too heavy but surely full of tricky decisions. 

I always play it with the turn order add because improves the game a lot. 

*update*

I have played lots of games and I enjoy Pergamon more and more each time.

Clever turn order selection, vying for research money, order of excavation, and level of excavation, while evaluating potential of scoring treasures at each level. Deciding when to exhibit is driven by not only scoring the maximum, but knocking down other players, and avoiding storage fees. A very neat middle weight game that can be played in about an hour.

A really simple and quick euro with lots to think about. Choosing your slot wisely to ensure you get the right place in the turn order, enough cash and are able to dig deeper enough is key. Few larger exhibitions seem to score better than lots of little ones.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I found this one a little frustrating as it appears that 1 or 2 single "lots" during the course of the game is enough to give a player the victory, since you can have 10+ points in one of those "V" lots later in the game.  If you happen to get turn order it's yours guaranteed, and if you don't, tough luck.

The game also comes over as being a simple exercise repeated over and over again without momentum ever building up.  You're just as likely to score a 7 at the beginning of the game as at the end.   

The polishing stuff 90 times to increase its value by 10-fold is also thematically stupid.

So, this gets a 6.  I'd play it again, but it's certainly one I won't shed tears for if it were to disappear and never be seen again.

Overall, a pretty cool game of timing.  You'll want to choose wisely when to spend your hard-to-come-by money on tiles for your collection, and when to hold off for better opportunities.

I also really enjoyed the push-your-luck aspect of getting money.  At the beginning of a round, you have a rough estimate of how much grant money for excavations will be available in the round.  People that choose to go early in the turn are pretty much guaranteed their money, but at a small amount, and people that choose to go late might make a lot of money, or they might get totally screwed if less money actually comes up than they had hoped.  A very cool mechanism that adds tension to what might otherwise be a pretty bland affair.

In the end, all these mechanics boil down to how to best get money while also obtaining sets of tiles which are turned in for points.  Pretty good stuff for a light-ish game.

Pergamon is a fantastic light-to-medium-weight set collection game with a nice push-your-luck aspect in the distribution of research funds and an interesting set devaluation mechanism that keeps players jockeying for older exhibits.  The theme was also implemented really well, much better than the average Euro; the flow of the game - competing for research funds, excavating finds, assembling an exhibit, counting admission tickets - makes complete sense thematically.  Very easy to learn, and just the right length too.  Finally, the components are great and I love the art by Klemens Franz.  Honestly, I am baffled as to why this game is not ranked higher, but then again, who gives a fuck about the rankings?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This was a pleasant surprise. While I definitely prefer meaty eurogames, I still enjoy some of the lighter eurogames. Pergamon is a very easy game to understand and play - yet it still offers interesting decisions, primarily when you bid on the excavation funds! You can either gamble or play it safe and be sure to get what you want this turn (though you still don’t know what the other players are going to do) so you can exhibit a big value collection. I really liked the element of putting together the different excavation tiles and show them in the museum. The exhibits offer you some interesting decisions and enable you to undermine the value of all of the existing exhibits. 

Pergamon scales well and is a good, light eurogame which can be played in 30-45 minutes. I do think I am going to get this to the table in the future, although the niche “light eurogame” is already quite big and a niche which I am gradually moving away from.

Not a bad game just nothing that makes me want to play it over and over. The placing of your meeple is the coolest part. The digging for art pieces is cool. The rest of the game is kind of repetitive. I would play it, but wouldn't recommend it, maybe every now and then. It does play quickly, which is nice for a game like this.

RATING: 6.5
Thrown in as a filler with rules that were easy to learn, and did exactly that. In the game we played once one player had broken away, or got a couple of really good matches, it was impossible to catch them but that might just be random chance. 

I'm not sure the make/break/remake mechanic works that effectively, or is way too generous, so may have to tweak some house rules.

The game seems very simple, but the decisions to be made are trickier than they look here: Turn order is VERY important, and the bizarre randomness of the money pool available adds a unique aspect that makes purchase order even trickier.

Harmless, good looking thematic game, with a fair bit of luck. Some interesting decisions during bidding in regards to funding and turn order manipulation, combined with light puzzle fitting and a push your luck element.

Update 2: Played 4 games in a row last night. It's even better than a thought. Lots of subtle decisions. And nice timing decisions interleaved with jockeying for position, kinda like the scoring rounds of El Grande versus the non-scoring rounds. I think this is now a staple game.

Update: I actually like this a little more on subsequent play. Pretty solid, if you don't mind a bit of luck.

Nice super-filler. I like the tension of choosing an action space based on more money versus earlier excavation. I think I prefer this to Thebes as my excavation game of choice. It's certainly simpler. Nicely streamlined I'd say. Although nothing spectacular.

RATING: 4
Inoffensive, randomness-ridden game of a series of guesses and then transforming the result into something-like-VPs by joining together 'broken tiles'. Artistically that is a nice touch, but that's as far as it goes. There is very little game worth speaking of here, which is a shame given that Stefan Dorra usually manages to bestow onto his designs a little extra or hook which at least makes it appear that there is more there than meets the eye. Regrettably not so in Pergamon, or to a lesser extent than usual. I'll give it that it blows the horrible Thebes / Jenseits von Theben clear out of the water because the randomness in this game at least affects all players mostly equally. But that is really not the reason why I would want to play or even purchase a title. Perhaps this game is fun for enthusiast families, but not for the more demanding gamer. Not even to wind down after a hard session.

There are several ideas here taken from other games that I appreciate separately.  But together it doesn't mesh that well.  I find the game to be dry and uninspiring.

Players choose to risk a level of investment to dig one of five levels in an excavation.  The tiles can then be combined if possible to create an exhibition.  Older pieces earn more points in the long run, but they will take a deeper investment to acquire.

This is ultimately a game about risk and trying to outguess your opponent.  If that's your thing, this game might be for you.  Personally, I'll pass.

RATING: 5
The decision of choosing a dig spot wasn't as interesting as I hoped it would be because the spaces are very flexible in terms of how much money you get and how far you can dig. Another minus is you easily take all in the row once you pay the cost.

The most interesting part is the push your luck element comes in with paying money to store your pieces until you gather enough to put them on a larger display for more points or to just put them on display for a shorter time for less points and save money.

An auction game designed around collecting sets of tiles and then using those tiles to create points. The conversion of tiles into points was a little strange and didn't click at first. Eventually I started to play better but missed out on the first scoring round as I kept getting boxed out in the bids. Another one I'd play again now that I know the rules better.

RATING: 5
Only partially due to there being a 3rd "dummy" player, our two-player session didn't work so well. Randomness determined a lot of the options and the outcome. Will try at least a couple more times.

This game looked like a more involved archaeology game than Mykerinos, but it's actually about the same weight--maybe even just slightly less.

The funding mechanic is well done, though.

Players are excavating the ancient ruins of Pergamon in the 19th century. Players on their turn apply for funds, use those funds to pull finds out of the dig site, then try to piece the finds together to create a lucrative exhibition. Very solid, but light, Euro that plays cleanly and manages to nail the theme very well.  Several nice ideas, the push-your-luck funding mechanism, puzzle matching the pieces, and the aging of the exhibits, etc. Lovely presentation, too. Few games in and the bloom is off.  Ultimately, Thebes does archaeology better.

I love this game for it's simplicity and how fun it is. Love it with 4 (as usual; I always love playing any game with more players, just love the company) and also turned to be great with two (Read below).

Tried it with 2-player today (28th Feb 2012) and it turned out to be a great one. Just that money appears to be abundant (not that much, but still high compared to 4 players). The tombraider (A.I., added in a 2 player game) turn out to be a great addition. Also, it's easy to control and only take seconds to move, just like the one in Glen More. It does feel like playing with 3 players.

Plus, I love teaching this game!

Taught by Mamadallama on 5-12-12.  I really, really liked this game and love how the theme really ties into all the parts of it.  I love the set number of rounds and scoring phases that you can plan for and the playing of the game.  Some luck, but that also ties into the theme.  I never thought that would matter to me since I adore abstracts, but this is one I would definitely buy whenever my finances would allow it.  I'd be interested in trading for it as well.

A great archeology game made of many different parts. First there is worker placement to receive money and dig options. But this comes with a push your luck aspect, too. Then you have set collection and money management. Better artifacts, storing more artifacts, and increasing the value of sets all cost money. I think all of these pieces fit together very well, The components are beautiful and of excellent quality. Compared to another archeology game, Thebes, Pergamon has less luck but it's still lucky. The push your luck aspect of the dig track is still very important in Pergamon.  Also, the exact artifact tile you need may show up exactly when and where you can afford it. I like this amount of luck for this game because it fits the theme, but it's not too much.

RATING: 4
An OK filler game but nothing that would make me seek out a copy for my collection. It's a game of pushing your luck for actions vs payouts. Fun for a play or two, but I can't see that mechanism holding up to repeated play.

When it's your turn to place your marker, you select a space that has a number of coins and the rows from which you are allowed to purchase (e.g. 2 coins/purchase from rows I and II only). The order in which everyone places is the order in which everyone gets paid after two income cards are flipped over. So if you're last in line and the money runs out before it comes to you, you get bupkus this turn. Once you do get paid, you can buy puzzle pieces from the rows for which you have permission. If you can put these puzzle pieces together, you may choose to exhibit your treasures in the museum and get points. If not, you better hope to get some connecting pieces next turn.

The problem is the more secure spots more often than not fill up first meaning the players later in turn order are forced to press their luck rather than everyone. So you alternate turns getting stuff for sure and pressing your luck. If one player gets lucky with a big haul, that's probably enough to be the difference.

Players are archaeologists digging for cultural treasures. Excavations cost money, though, so you need to collect grants before you can start.

The excavation area is randomly populated each turn, and each player places a pawn on an action space that decides about turn order, how much money you get, and how deep you're allowed to dig (in general, more precious artifacts can be found in the lower layers). Once you've uncovered some complete artifacts you can send them to the museum for fame (and VPs).

Most of the game is in the action space selection, but even this part feels mostly automatic. If there's an interesting selection of finds on offer you take the first space that provides enough money to get there (without giving an opponent the opportunity to get there first). If you don't have the money, well, you try to get some.

A light, tactical family game for budding archaeologists. For gamers, there is very little meat to the ancient bones.

Pergamon is a very pleasant set collection game that generally flows well. It is a theme that I absolutely adore and all the components are top notch. The 2-player game with the dummy player (Tomb Raider) is probably one of the better dummy player versions, which I normally dislike. This game isn't as simple as it looks! Keeping things balanced and capitalizing on timing is key, and the little luck that's thrown into it fleshes out the tension of the game. Can be a little repetitive, but the set number of rounds helps that. Overall, a very nice game that I'm happy to own.

Fun game about the digging up archaeological finds and completing treasure halves to exhibit them in museum (the Pergamon in Berlin). Bidding mechanic (to raise funds for expedition) and older-exhibits-are-less-attractive mechanic are innovative and true to the theme. Very nicely illustrated board and components round off a solid eurogame.

The tomb raider is an a$$hole.

Fairly light, but there are some interesting decisions to be made. I really like the mechanism for receiving funding/excavation order. My 9yo struggled a bit with that at first, but he started to get the hang of it towards the end of the game - and took what I was hoping to get a couple of times!

 I really like the game and it plays very nicely with two. Over 80% of Geeks recommend the game with two, although it seems to be at its best when played with three. 

I really like the process of acquiring funds and finds, where you have to balance the need for funds with a desire to get to the excavation site early to snaffle the best finds. I like how you have some idea of how much money may be available each turn- but not the exact amount so it is in the each player’s hands to decide how far they will push their luck.

I love how satisfying it is to physically slot you finds together to create a continuous collection. I also love how the tickets give you a visual representation of how many visitors have come to see your collections

It is a game that is easy to learn and can be completed within an hour and just nicely ticks all the boxes that my wife and I look for when purchasing a new game.

A light family game with nice graphics and pleasant gameplay. Nothing new and yet it plays fine. The one thing I didn't like about Pergamon was it's core mechanic - the amount of money in every round was random which made planning almost impossible.

This continues to hold up well to repeated play. Such a good game, bringing together different elements and things to think about.
---------------------
Very nice game here. There are several very cool parts that are tense, and they all work together nicely. The bidding for research funds is great, and tough. And the puzzle-like part of putting together the finds is also a very nice piece. And it's all wrapped up without too many rules into a tight game.

Nicely organized board guides game play, but it could have been bigger as calendar symbols are obscured by game tiles. Both the jockeying for gold and the competing for museum popularity mechanisms are smart. However, scarcity of gold combined with bad luck of the draw of artifact tiles can leave players with no choice but to pass, which isn't too exciting.

Great smelling game
not a whole lot of components, but a nice quality

As for game play. It's played in 12 turns. When setting it up you wonder how long those turns can go. Wellthey go quickly. There really are only three decision points. The first on is somewhat a risk reward choice which at times can be interesting. One is simply a spend now or later. And finally if to make one or more exhibits. While I could be wrong I really think the final decision is only a last turn choice. The money question is minor. 

So really there in one decision point.

So if someone is looking for a 'deep' game, this isn't it.

That said, it's easy to teavh, plays quick and is a fun romp. 

Overall it's an very 'ok' game. Nothing new and exciting. But, I was up for a second play the same night.

Nice quality components, love the reduction in interest of previous/older exhibits.

Game requires $$ to do anything, and if you are unlucky, can lead to a pretty boring game.  You need to predict what the other players need, how much cash they will most likely require to pick the item up, and you'll have to try to predict how much cash will be available.  More likely then not, someone will play before you and get the cash and the item, then you are left not doing much of anything for the turn...  If there are a few rounds with low income, the game drags...

Too long for what it is, and too random when it comes to $$, which is absolutely required if you want to dig for relics.

This feels like a throwback to the Euro designs of 20 years ago, which is great as far as I'm concerned.

My first impression was very good, and so it remains.

The theme doesn't come through. Excavating certain slots.. how would you know what you'll find before digging? It just seems pasted over.
Despite that the mechanics are nothing special.
Also the VPs are in the form of museum tickets, it's a try of being "thematic" but it's a drag to pile all of them up, instead of just using a VP track.

So all in all, there are much better euros.

Surprisingly entertaining twist on the set collecting genre but my expectations were pretty low in first place as it sounded like a boring Thebes clone with the drab design taken from Mines of Zavandor. While I still don't like the design except the VP chits, I would rather play Pergamon than Thebes.

A nicely produced game about archeology that I like more than the similarly themed Mykerinos. A brilliant fund distribution system is the core of the game and it felt really fresh to me. It offers the possibility for risk taking and decides the  playing order for both the ongoing and the next turn and it also manages to keep the game interesting to the very end. There should be more victory point chips in the box.

Very nice game and well balanced for 2 player or multi-player. You collect cash to buy jigsaw bits to match-up to place an exhibit to get points, each part of the game neatly meshes with the next. Each part leaves you feeling an element of control, the only minor drawback is the cash collection mechanism, although very nice in itself there is a strong element of luck which if you are unlucky can badly affect your game, otherwise it would have been a strong 8.

If you are after the theme get Thebes instead, as Pergamon is as shallow as can be on that front.  The mechanics on this game take all the space and are very drab.  There is some level of strategy but less than you would initially imagine.  Every action impacts everything and make it very hard to really plan.  Many times points will go to someone because of happenstance.  Overall makes for a very forgettable experience.

It’s fun to play and it will leave you with some great gaming memories, that you can dig up and reflect on in years to come! Well done all-round!"

Digging for ancient treasures is a theme that lends itself so well to gaming  - set collection, planning, etc. - that the comparative dearth of actual games is a bit surprising. While playing Pergamon, a possible explanation occurred to me: the perfect archaeological game already exists in Jenseits von Theben, and nobody wants to compete with it.

Although Pergamon presents a really nifty optimization puzzle with a good mixture of taking chances and making plans, I just can't imagine a situation where I would not rather play Theben instead. Since the quality of design as well as the impact of luck is comparable, the decisive setback for Pergamon is probably the abstraction of the things you'll excavate, especially compared with the vibrant and detailed treasures in Jenseits von Theben.

RATING: 3
I did *not* enjoy this game.  I believe my problem is partly due to the cognitive dissonance between a turn order and action selection mechanism that suggests that medium to long term planning and a commodity market that is very random and rewards people who are lucky enough to be in the right place at the right time.

It also has more randomness than I prefer.  

I believe I said, while playing the game and trying to explain an issue I had that it wasn't worth talking about because I was never going to play the game again.

12-21-11-Hopefully we now understand the rules re: polishing.  You may only polish (up to 3) when first exhibiting, except in the last round where you may polish all you want but again, this applies only to new exhibits.  

12-18-11-Played two 2p games w/Casey.  Lots of fun!  Interesting how the auction mechanism works, I get frantic thinking I am way behind and though I did lose both games, both times were only by 4 or 5 pts.

Fantastic little game! My wife and I loved our first play of Pergamon. The gameplay is silky smooth, the components are very nice, I quite like the small footprint, and the game is simply FUN! My wife and I compared this to Thebes, and like the former much better (although Thebes is fun as well). Most importantly, at least for my wife and I, the 2 player game played so well. The Tomb Raider player works so well and is so easy to use. It reminded me a little bit of Leonardo in Fresco, but I prefer the Tomb Raider. I know it's out of print, but every gamer truly needs this in their collection.

Update 9/27/14: Erin played this with 2 friends last night (I was not in the game). She said that despite being a little rusty on the rules and having to "learn" though the first couple of turns, the game was a hit.

RATING: 6
Nothing wrong here, but nothing special either. The bidding system seems interesting, but in the 3-player game at least once the first player bids the next two bids practically make themselves. Also, as a friend pointed out, the implementation of the theme is bizarre. You are playing an archaeologist digging for artifacts, but in this game you always know exactly where the artifacts are! Only your income is uncertain. That's weird even for a euro game.

RATING: 7
I don't know why I like Auction games 'cos I'm crap at them! But this is an interesting variation on "Auctioning" with the bid track constraining what you can do in the dig phase as well as the net cost of your dig. Also included some push your luck and mild screwage. A lot of fun and somewhat underrated in my opinion

Had to have this as part of my Germanophile collection. I visited the Pergamon museum in 2007, and with no other game with this theme in my collection....

Tricky, but fun game to play, with no shortage of uncertainty making the game quite tense. I quite like it.

It plays best with 2 players and the tomb raider, or three, I think. We've had enough fun with four, but money becomes really, really tight as regardless of how many players are playing, the amount of investment at the beginning of each round is the same.

My first play was somewhat enjoyable. I miscalculated some of the synergies between worker placement and digging, but still enjoyed the play nonetheless. One of the other players got what seemed to be an unsurmountable lead, and I didn't see a way to catch up from my slow start. That's OK in a light 60 minute game, but it would be a big negative in a 2+ hour game.

A straight forward but competitive game of excavation and exhibiting (for VPs). There's a cool push-your-luck income + turn-order mechanism and better exhibits can push yours back, thus earning less points. What keeps it interesting is that during the phases VPs are handed out certain exhibits receive bonuses, depending on who has them and which one is the oldest. Playing feels fairly abstract though despite the reasonable theme.

My favorite archeology themed game. Beats Thebes and Mykerinos hands down.

Good push your luck directly against the other players.

The game is pretty simple... there's a bit of luck involved in the process, starting with the Money that there will be available in Research Funds that it's not certain how much there will be, you know what the lowest amount and the highest amount can be but you will only know the exact amount after selecting the action space you want to do in the round and that will award some money or not, depending on the places the other players selected and the amount of money that was up for grabs...

I like this element of luck in the game, it makes you decide some "Push Your Luck" decisions or going for the "Sure" thing...

There's also luck in the 5 tiles that come out every turn and where they end up in the excavations spots...

With that being said, the game is interesting, I "dig" the theme (pun intended) and I like how fast the game plays... it really flies by 

I consider this to be a very interesting light weight game, very good to introduce people to modern gaming.

Some really very good production values in this one and again, clever ideas and mechanics.

I only had the one game which we played this as a two-player game which, I think, is not the best way to showcase what this game is all about. It felt hard to reagin the initative once it was lost and only having one ‘real’ opponent to bid against took away a lot of what the game could potentially be about.

That said, the tomb robber mechanism was quite good and the way that scores can be degraded as better exhibitions are displayed is quite fun.

I'd consider playing again, but only with more than two players. Another one I'm unlikley to purchase.

RATING: 7
There are many clever and intriguing moments in this game of archeology. Each turn money is allocated based on a bidding system where a high turn order means less money and vice versa. However, there is an unknown total (within known boundaries) so you may end up with less money anyway. The money is then used to buy artifacts from excavation levels. The more turns you wait, the more artifacts are added to each level, but if you wait too long, someone else may excavate it first. Finally you need to put artifacts together to be able to display them at the museum and score victory points. The more you put together, the longer it will take for you to get it to the museums but the longer it will stay there.

Although those moments may be luck-driven, they provide a tense and pleasant game experience.

It is a game I had always been curious about. Even more now, because I recently traveled to Pergamum and saw the ruins :-)

But after playing it, I feel a bit let down.
·) The luck factor is too big for me (luck in the money cards, the item tiles and the matches, etc).
·) I also find the duration is excesive (time between turns is too long at times, people checking for possible tile matches, do mathematical calculations, take decisions, etc).
·) The strategy is almost non existant and the tactic content is also quite light.

RATING: 7
Great value for the price and box size, with a complexity level somewhere between a family game and a gamers' game. Interesting decisions and shortish playing time but not quite original or engaging enough to end up on the wishlist. Will happily play again, though.

There seems to be too few victory point markers, so you'll likely end up using the coins as substitutes.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Neat tactical game with a bit of push-your-luck, which is very accesible for non-gamers too. The rules are easy to understand, since they "make sense" with the theme of the game. Get money for the excavations, dig out your relic halves and store them until you have a nice collection you want to show in the museum to collect victory points.
I like the way the money collection & max allowed digging depth implementation is made. As well the mechanism that makes the old exhibitions at the museum lose interest is a nice touch.
I recommend playing with the game variant, which determines the playing order for the next turn based on the reverse playing order of the current turn.

RATING: 8
Lively as any player would expect from Stefan Dorra, Pergamon merges auctions and resource management in a rather nice fashion: players can place fixed bids that include turn order, income and possible lots to choose in each turn. Those lots are literally lots on the ground, that turn after turn reveal samples of archaeological pieces.

With these loose bits, players can assemble the original ancient artworks and display them on a museum; the more artworks, the more potent the exhibition. Newer exhibitions claim the interest of the viewer, leaving old ones obsolete (nice realistic touch).

Pergamon plays quickly, the decisions taken in it can sometimes be quite a pain, there are no mechanics either counterintuitive or difficult to digest (as it can happen with some of, say, Stefan Feld's designs) and its artwork is lovely. All in all, the game might not be the most innovative one on Earth but, as far as gentle brain massage and entertainment are concerned, it's a rather round success.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Pergamon is archaeologically themed: players compete for research grants, build collections and exhibit. Victory points measure the number of people who come to see the display.

It is crucial to get the best items for exhibition, but this requires cash. Generally, getting more money means sacrificing the chance to get the best items. Often plays build a bank for a few turns then make a rush to get items; there is a push-your-luck element to this which is really fun. Observing your opponents and predicting their choices is essential. It is useful to count the money cards, by the way; accurately predicting funds available at the end of the game can make a huge difference.

There are a couple of negatives: the artefact images (left and right) do not match clearly, and there are stacks of counters in the middle of the board that topple easily. But all things considered: good game!

[b]Pergamon[/b] was traded away in a math trade 8/8/14. (Received Balloon Cup)
Received in a math trade (5/15/14).

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (6):[/COLOR]

[i]This game had a short life in my house. In a nutshell it quickly fell victim to the Jones Theory in favor of Thebes: The Tomb Raiders (which we already owned). I had heard a lot of good things about Pergamon, and I definitely enjoyed the bidding process for gold/where you could dig, but after that the game offered very few difficult decisions. Building the exhibitions with the tiles was fun, but the whole museum aspect of the game fell flat for me. 

In comparison I like how time track determines player order in Thebes: TTR and the fact that you never know what you are going to pull from a dig, even if you know what cards are in the pile. I also appreciate the different scoring opportunities in Thebes: TTR, where as in Pergamon you only score based on your museum position and a few bonuses along the way. Thebes:TTR also plays better with 2 and is quite portable making it a great cafe game. 

At the end of the day Pergamon isn't a "bad" game, but in our small collection I only felt the need to keep one archaeology game and Thebes: The Tomb Raiders won by a land slide (the same was true for my kids which sealed the deal).[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]- The push your luck mechanic when choosing how much money you try to get which is also tied to which level of dig site you can excavate from.
- Putting together exhibitions is fun, as you try to put together all the different tiles you have excavated.
- My kids enjoy it, especially my daughter.[/i]

Pleasant Euro with some interesting mechanics. Tiles come out so you see what's up for sale. Then you can see what range money will come in, but you won't be sure how much - do you gamble on low range, take the sure (but low) money and secure an early buy of the cheap tiles, or do you gamble on high range and risk getting more money and buying the expensive tiles. Once you've completed some tile sets, you display them, and the better they are, the more scores it will generate before eventually getting pushed off the board by more "recent" tile sets. It plays pretty quickly, there's some analysis required of what tiles will help your set and what other people will be likely to go for, plus the ongoing question of when to shoot for the good stuff and when to settle for the cheap stuff. It'll get more play in that light Euro type niche.

A nice light game where you collect artifacts to display them in the museum. Money is given out each turn, but if you get too greedy or ambitious, you may get none, but you may also hit a jackpot. Bring your artifact collections to the museum, but after a while, people are no longer interested, so they bring less and less points.

Played at Noorderspel. We really liked this. 

Interesting bidding game. You know everyone will get between x and y amount of money, so you put your guy on a number. The lowest bid gets his/her money, but the highest bid gets the left overs (which could be more than the number on your space). You then use the money you just got to get tiles (excavate objects from an archeological dig) that have two halves of objects on them, as well as halves of dates BCE. Lowest bid goes first, so getting more money means (possibly) fewer choices in tiles. There are 4 different objects. The aim of the game is to get points by making exhibitions, which means puzzling the tiles you've bought together so they fit and make the oldest objects, because those are worth extra points. We had a lot of fun playing this one.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Pergamon moves fairly quickly, and players have frequent, tricky decisions to make.   Though there is a heap of luck (if a person gets a 4-piece set that person's likely to win AND the money situation can be pretty crazy), a lot of it evens out, and collectively, folks prevent others from getting too much good stuff.  What's kind of weird is that you'll put yourself in a position to make a big score, but a bit of bad luck can force you to delay for one extra turn, and you curse, but then you realize you were only in that position in the first place because of luck.

So the control in this one seems like a mirage.  Though you can outwit people by getting the bonuses sometimes, that hinges more on people not paying attention (or being overwhelmed with all the other mechanics) than long-term strategy.

Interesting example of how to make simple mechanics, like set collecting, interesting.  The action system (with players vying for action points [$$] and collecting possibilities) is extremely smart.  What's amazing to me is that it still plays quickly.  A game with this many useful details (the downgrading of exhibitions, for example) rarely plays as quickly.  Clever, clever.

Played one game online which may be the best format as it seems the fractured finds, which adds an optimizing puzzle, may well slow down evaluating and decision making. 

So Thebes with the less arduous assessment of other players holdings may still be the best of the archeology games.

It's a game about a museum I've been at, so I had to try it out. Very interesting mechanism of distributing money and selecting digging priority. On top of that you have to manage two resources: money and your artifacts. Rules are not too complicated and a lot of decision to be made. Sometimes it can drag a bit, but it's a minor complaint.

RATING: 4
Played this two player, which is perhaps not the most ideal form of this game. You get in a line to buy pieces of artifacts which you combine and put on display. There's a lot of knocking other players around in this game (for a euro). So far I'd say good, but not great... but I'm holding out for the 3 or 4p experience to really judge it properly. One frustrating piece of the game is how hard it is to collect enough money to buy the row of artifact pieces you want.

I can't claim this is an exciting or unusual game, and I was torn between a 6 or a 7 rating. But I think it's a really well-crafted and polished classic family Euro, and it's nice to see one of those these days that isn't a worker placement derivative. It also has a pretty strong mechanics-to-theme fit for a game of this type, and it's not about medieval castles! I enjoyed it a lot more than Thebes, a game with a similar weight, audience and theme. Dorra confirms himself as one of my most reliable designers.

UPDATE: second play and it's solidly a 7. Really nice little game.

This is a great middle weight euro. It takes a little brain power, but won't leave you with a headache. It also has some very well designed and unique mechanics.

RATING: N/A
Pros:
* Easy to explain.
* The push-your-luck element to get money and select your max depth was fun and somewhat unique in my collection.
* Really liked the trade off of hording to get a high scoring exhibit vs. having to pay for storage.

Cons:
* There's a tiny bit of fiddly upkeep in moving exhibits down when you add new ones or after scoring rounds.
* Somewhat tedious setup with all of the stacks on the calendar spaces, although you could (and I probably will if/when I play again) just use a draw bag and a round marker.

Neutral:
* The 2 player game requires a dummy player, but it works quite well.

Digging for treasure and creating museum exhibits is a theme I'd like to see more of in games. Despite how simple and quick Pergamon is, the theme actually comes through pretty well. For the price, I kind of hoped there was a deeper game here, but If you go in expecting a gateway or filler game you'll be pleased to find a pretty darn good one here.

Light-medium weight auction game that has great components, is fairly easy to explain, but offers great replayability. It supports 2-4 players very well and while Euro in style, interaction is much greater because there's only 2 resources that the 3-4 players are competing for.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Simple rules. The game involves trading off turn order and income (research funds) with access to increasingly valuable vaults, from which relics are excavated. Relics are pieced together in chains via set collection, then displayed in a museum for victory points (one for each display, more during scoring rounds). Each scoring round pays out a bonus for a certain type of relic (e.g. oldest vase), and displays in the museum decay over time, requiring good timing.

RATING: 7
This game was a rather pleasant surprise to me, as I wasn't expecting much from it (my wife bought it solely because it was cheap). Mechanically it is both interesting and kind of neat, especially the "bidding" phase where you place your workers on a track indicating how much money you are trying to get and which items you are allowed to claim - if you get the chance. Especially as you can get a big reward if you risk a late slot and there is a lot of money left over after the other players' choices. I also found it rarely an easy decision whether to go for multiple low-value exhibits or build up for big ones - and when to use your precious coins to "polish" the exhibits for extra VPs.

All in all, this is an excellent lighter game.

An archeaology game to give [i]Thebes[/i] a little rest. More than half the game is about "knowing" where to place your pawn in the funds distribution part.

Pergamon
This game: All plays | User plays
Using worker placement to bid for the chance to obtain funds and excavate on various levels. Do you go for excavate order and the first chance at the available money each round, or aim for a more lucrative level based on the tiles that come out each turn. The actual amount of money each round is random - so going for a particular level and tile set you need might mean you are shut out of the money.

Your goal is to collect sets by matching halves of treasures on tiles. By matching the images you create an exhibit - the more tiles that you are able to string together the larger and more valuable (points) exhibits. You also have the option to polish your exhibit and make it worth more.

Each time an exhibit worth more is placed, people lose interest in yours and it drops down in value. After each scoring round, your exhibit drops down again and eventually moves out of the museum so you need to keep finding more - and more valuable - items to exhibit.

The game is easy to pick up and plays quickly - 45 minutes for our first 4 player game.

I heard someone call Pergamon a "super-filler game", and I think 'super-filler' is a perfectly fitting description.

The game plays quickly and is the rarest of birds: a bidding game that works extremely well with two players. For two, there is a variant that includes a tomb raider meeple that snatches up some of the research funds on offer each turn; then, he steals off into the night with his looted artifact to sell on the black market.

Stefan Dorra who did For Sale helped design this game too. It plays in ~35/40 minutes with setup/cleanup.

In Pergamon, you are German archeologists in the 19th Century excavating a Greek city that lies in modern-day Turkey. The game involves bidding for pieces of archeological finds like masks and vases which you fit together to form whole artifacts which you then exhibit in the Pergamon Museum to score points.

The fun is two-fold: building your exhibit by puzzling-together these shards of masks and bracelets, and bidding for the most cash and best turn order for acquiring these shards.

I think its OOP currently, but it's such an excellent light-weight-game-with-medium-weight-strategy, that it's sure to see another print run.

Pergamon -- 

Definitely use the turn order variant, but note that the variant, as printed, has an [thread=635580]error[/thread].

[q="In a post to the Rules Forum dated March 28, 2011, deltarn"]To clarify, from the german rules:

[u]The basic rules should say:[/u]

The start player from the next turn is the one on the leftmost position on the funds track. The other players take their turn [b]in clockwise order[/b] from this new start player.

[u]Variante 1: Turn order for 3 4 players (for a more tactical game):[/u]

The player who occupied the leftmost position on the funds track, put is token on the space marked 1 (on the rifght of the board). 
The  player who occupied the second leftmost position on the funds track, put is token on the space marked 2.
The  player who occupied the third leftmost position on the funds track, put is token on the space marked 3.
The  player (if any) who occupied the fourth leftmost position on the funds track, put is token on the space marked 4.

For the next turn player take their turns in [b]the order indicated by the number from 1 to 4.[/b][/q]
[q="Furthermore, in the same thread, one of the game's designers, Stefan Dorra,"]:meeple: Variant 1 should be the normal rule for all players. And of course, it should mean [b]For the next turn player take their turns in the order indicated by the number from 1 to 4[/b].

Not too bad for your standard archaeology type game. It has all the right elements but it didnt "WOW" me. I think people who enjoy the setting/theme more would rate this higher. I would definitely play this again though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The first phase (getting funding) reminds me of choosing waking-up time in Fresco, with a push-your-luck twist. Going early gets you less funds (but a guaranteed amount) and more choices at excavation. Going later can potentially get you more funds, but less choices at excavation, and the risk of funds running out.

The third phase (displaying artifacts) feels very thematic. A bigger display of artifacts gets you more points, and also overshadows displays of lesser value. But you cannot rest on your laurels either, as display values naturally depreciate over time.

The board is highly functional, and packs a lot of activity in a small board. I particularly like the ticket-shaped VPs. 2P games work surprisingly well with the tomb raider helping clear the gallery. I also do really badly in this game, coming in dead last in 6 games out of 8...

The one problem that holds me back from giving this game a higher rating is that playing time depends on who you are playing with. There can be some mild amounts of downtime in this game, as players figure what is the optimal way to piece their exhibition together. Competitive players will also try to 'solve' their opponents display, which may drag the game a bit.

A very enjoyable game combining set collecting and a type of push your luck bidding phase in a theme of archaeological digs and exhibiting your finds in a museum.  The money for the field work is obtained from research grants that are sought after competitively, and victory points come from the relative popularity of your exhibitions of artifacts recovered.  Beautifully produced, with some nice mechanics that work with the theme.  Pretty easy to learn, and then only takes an hour or so.  Pleasant and enjoyable.  And there's a nice variant included for 2-player games, with a (partial) dummy player Tomb Raider, who often takes some of the research funds and artifacts that the players might have been seeking. Highly recommended.

RATING: 6
I am so bad at this!!

But an interesting little game of set-collection and bidding, with an archeological theme and some interesting mechanisms:
- Each round, 2 money cards (values 1-4 or 5-8; group visible on back) are chosen. Then players, in turn order, place their meeple on the track: further to right = earlier (but lesser) money distribution, but later action order this round. After meeples placed, reveal the cards and distribute the sum from right to left (if money runs out, those remaining players are out of luck!).
- The chosen spaces also determine how far you can dig (up to 5 levels deep). On your turn, you can dig up to the indicated depth, spending 1 coin per level; collect all the items placed at that level (there's an initial setup, to which new items are added each round; older, more valuable items tend to be deeper)
- Then, may put together the finds, which show fragments on left and right side, into a continuous chain; value = sum of numbers of the completed drawings; can spend 0-3 coins to improve value; mark value on board (players each have 3 markers which may be in play at any time), pushing everything of equal or lower value down one space. You can also save your bits to put together a better display later, but must pay if saving too many pieces (first 3 are free).
- There are 12 rounds in the game, with 4 scoring rounds. Each scoring round rewards a different type of find with bonus VP to the player with the best (oldest) item on display of that type.

All this creates some interesting tensions, forcing you to choose between turn order, access to deeper digs, and earning investment money each turn; spending money to improve your collection vs. saving it for future digs; timing when to do what. Mechanically, this is actually a pretty cool game! And I like the theme, too.

I _should_ like the game more! I probably would, too, if only I were half way competent at it! Certainly worth some more plays, though ... maybe I'll figure it out eventually!

I wanted to try this mostly for the theme (I was so impressed with the Pergamon Museum in Berlin), I usually enjoy Euros and especially the puzzley aspect of 'building' your exhibition sounded like it should work for me. But it was so dull, I was so glad when it was over.
The auction mechanic to get the most funding for your expedition is very neat, so is the scoring with the final artifact, I guess the mechanics are not to blame, though I am not overly enthusiastic about bidding in games. The game play itself was simply a drag, no tension, not much strategy and planning, it just went by and dragged and dragged. I admit, the theme is not the most exciting one but I still think Pergamon deserves a better game, this doesn't work for me.

The bidding and income mechanic are very clever - and frustratingly fun - in Pergamon. The game seems to fly by, which is always a sign that the game is nicely streamlined and yet entertaining, engaging and deep.

The theme sounds awesome and Spieleschmiede had a group buy running for it for super cheap, so I went in on that. Even if it just provides a small-footprint thematic filler it will be worth the price they asked. English edition, but the game is language neutral and the rules are available for download. First play went fine and it feels really nice. Will need more plays to see if it has staying power, but as my only press-your-luck and bidding game, I am happy to fill that niche with this one.

A game of excavating finds, and assembling exhibits of antiquities in a museum. There's set collection in there, but with restrictions on how you can put pieces together, push-your-luck turn order for money collection and excavation priority as well as timing issues about how long you wait to get your exhibit into the museum, as they all lose value over time. 

Actually pretty good, not too much time wasted on most decisions, and the interesting ones (scrabbling for grant money and dig licences) go nice and quickly. Has been popular whenever it has come out.

It stays an interesting game (with an infuriating tomb robber) when played with 2.

High production value. Very well thought game. Nice theme and game mechanisms. I really like it, but there is some luck in this game, it is not a forgiving game, and the turn order with the variant rules increases the influence of the luck factor instead of decreasing it. Give it a try, it is a very nice game.

Pergamon is a neat little game.  The theme is fairly unique... You are an archaeologist digging up artifact fragments, assembling them and showing them in a museum.  Older artifacts draws more visitors and ticket tubs are the victory points.  The heart of the game is choosing the research spots which determine who resolves first, how much of the research funds you might get, which sites you can excavate and turn order next turn.  You can try taking a later spot but risk getting shorted on funds or having some steal your desired dig site.

About [thing=90040][/thing]:

[b]1) What is it?[/b]
[thing=90040][/thing] is a set collection game in which player compete to gather the most glory, and to do this, need to collect research grants and dig sites in the city of Pergamon, in order to find the best ancient pieces and put them in exhibitions in the museum.

While [thing=90040][/thing] isn't a truly thematic game, it does represent well the hype formed around exhibitions: when the player puts up an exhibition, she adds the age (century) of all the pieces that make the exhibition and that will be the value (attraction = points of honor or glory) of it. When a new exhibition (from any player, including the same) surpasses this value, it decreases the attraction of all the past exhibitions of lesser value, up to a point that it simply "leaves" the exhibition halls of the museum and go to the storage rooms (ie: it leaves play and the pieces are returned to the box). There is a constant pressure to find neat pieces, put them together and exhibit them, to stay in the spotlight of the archaeology world.

[thing=90040][/thing] is very easy to grasp, teach and play, with a playing time of 12 rounds that passes like a breeze. It requires, usually, one "hard" decision per round (the amount of research grant wanted), as the other two - which set to dig (buy) and if make an exhibition or not is considerable easier, and the former players usually do coupled with the funds asked, while the latter can be changed more often and must be adjusted due to lack of funds or because someone took the site you wanted to dig.

But don't be mistaken: while [thing=90040][/thing] isn't a difficult game to play, it does offer a nice set of options to make players happy: there is interaction (indirect), some risk assessment, a good amount of tatical decisions and a little strategy involving money (both to purchase later and to spend making exhibitions better). Not a lot, but enough for [thing=90040][/thing] be considered "rich" for the short frame of time for the whole play be completed.

The best I can say is that it was a joy to play [thing=90040][/thing] - quick, smart, well done, and sufficient light to work as a family game, and heavy enough to please more hardcore gamers. Stefan Dorra sure knows his trade.

[b]2) How do you play?[/b]
[thing=90040][/thing] is played for 12 rounds. In each of them pieces will be revealed and organized in order, considering the century of it, in rows. The lower rows are the deeper ones, and are harder to dig there. Then two research grant cards will be revealed, both staying face down. On their backs has the information of the minimum and maximum value of each grant card. With this information, players, one at a time, decide which will be the amount of fund they will be looking for. The more money one wants, bigger are the chances that she will receive less than asked (if anything at all) and later she will dig (buy) - the opposite is true: the lesser amounts are often paid in full and the person digs first. In the research grant track there are several spots, each with two informations: the amount of money asked and the how deep (from 1 to 5) will the player be able to dig. The most attractive pieces (the most old) are, usually, in the deeper places.

After everyone decides for a spot, the grant cards are flipped face up. The money is paid in order to the players. An example serves best here. Say the grant cards show a mininum of 2 money and a maximum of 8 money. The funds amounts in the track range from 0 to 6. There are three players and the order of picking a place in the track starts from the one last to the first in the track in the last round played. The first player to pick puts in the first spot of 2 money (there are more than one spot for the same amount of money, what changes are the position and how deep the digging can go). The second player places her marker in a 1 money spot. The third player takes and risk and put is marker in the last spot in the track, asking for 6 money. The two grant cards are flipped and the amount sent was 4 money. The first and second player are paid in full, while the third receives 1 money. The first person to dig (buy) is the second player (as she was ahead in the grant track).

Following the order of the grant track, players can dig (buy) all tiles from one row (up to how deep can the person dig). At this time players must decide if they will make an exhibition. Pieces that count towards the attraction level of the exhibition must have two parts - one saying the century of it and other the decade and year. For instance, if I make an exhibition using a mask from 437, a vase from 378 and and bracelet from 569, the attraction value of it will be 4+3+5=12. I can pay up to 3 money to up this value by one for each money spent. The higher the level, more time the exhibition will stay showing in the museum and the more glory I will gain during the evalutations phases.

When a new exhibition of higher value is put in the museum, all the ones of lesser value decrease in attraction. Each exhibition made immediately gives 1 point to the player.

Scoring will happen 4 times during the play, and in each one type of piece will earn the player that have the oldest piece of such type 2 extra points. Points in the scoring are given accordingly to the level of the exhibitions the players have in the museum. In the final scoring, there will be extra bonus points awarded for the first, second and third oldest pieces still in exhibition.

The player with the most glory (points) will be the winner!

[b]3) Which are the decisions made during play?[/b]
The most important in most rounds will be the amount of fund - and place - that you will take in the research grant fund track. This is because not only you will gain money (or don't) and is with money that you make everything else, but also because is the moment where you can push other players in doing what they don't want to, like accepting less than what they want, or pushing their luck and going higher on the track, and maybe gaining nothing. And finally because the place you pick says how deep you will be able to dig (buy) for pieces and the order of the digging. With so many ramifications is easy to see why this is the key decision in the game - and you will be doing it 12 times during the play, all accordingly to the grant cards revealed.

Next is what row of pieces to take. This is usually given - normally you decide in the level of fund which row interests you. There were no surprises that, after the money was given, Immediately thereafter the pieces were taken with no delay or further thoughts. There were, however, situations in that one player was expecting X money and got only Y, and wasn't able to pay to dig the row she wanted, and had to change plans, either by saving the money or taking a cheaper row. Still, 80% of the time this wasn't the case.

Then there is the decision of what to do with the pieces. Keeping them, over 3 pieces, has a cost, and it must be taken into consideration, as having more pieces assures a better exhibition, a more lasting one, but waiting too much can be too costly also, making you lose opportunities of digging better pieces.

Making an exhibition also must taken into ponderation the level of the others already in the museum, even your own; and the round of the game: if a scoring is coming, usually a weak exhibit is better then no exhibit.

Overall, the decisions aren't hard, as is possible to see the pieces of others, notice the rows they are interested in, and work around or to overcame.

[b]4) What are the good things in the game?[/b]
- Beautiful point markers, one of the best I know of;
- Smart gameplay with a good flow throughout the game;
- Small downtime;
- Short playing time with meaningful decisions (but not overly complex ones);
- Good level of interaction, without being mean or allowing direct conflict - which serves well for families;
- Easy to teach, with a soft learning curve;
- Language independant.

[b]5) Which are the bad news?[/b]
- Probably the worst player "aid" (a double-sided card) I have ever seen;
- Has a theme, but really isn't thematic (though the museum part works pretty well);
- The luck elements in the pieces reveal and grant cards (risk assessment) can turn some people off.

[b]6) How do you feel while playing?[/b]
This isn't Indiana Jones and the Curse of [thing=90040][/thing], is more like a special from the History Channel about the dispute of several teams to uncover the best pieces of the lost city of [thing=90040][/thing]. Still exciting, yes, but, well, less. While [thing=90040][/thing] isn't about whips, running, shooting and fighting off baddies, it does have battles for funds, some fine digging and a museum.

The flow of [thing=90040][/thing] is so easy going that, while playing, I felt relaxed, in spite of being a competitive game. There are some dispute over the pieces and the exhibition of others keep sending yours back, which make [thing=90040][/thing] more than a multiplayer solitaire, and still remaining "friendly" enough.

[thing=90040][/thing] is a well done game, that can fit in basically every group, except for those looking for a heavy strategy game with zero luck and direct conflict, or a truly thematic experience. [thing=90040][/thing] is a true euro and works perfectly for what it was meant to. Very recommended.

Interesting game, and you can really mess with your competitors.  So if you like this it is a puzzle, worker placement, and timing game.  The theme matches the game, interesting mechanics, but nothing too new.

Love the gambling aspect of deciding where to place your meeple in order to obtain the right combination of money and digging depth. The rest of the game is less original, but works like a charm. With three, this family game only takes about 45 - 60 minutes, an amount of playing time which fits this game perfectly. Enjoyable game (even with two) and incredibly good value for money considering its quality components.

An easy example of 'too long for what it is'.  It takes time to figure out how to arrange your artifacts, what you can buy that fits in, and where you need to place to get what you'd want - end result being a lot of thinking for not so much actual depth.

Very fun mid-weight euro. Ultimately, game play is very simply. You put your token on a spot which gives you a variable amount of money, and access to certain levels of digging. You then take all the artifact pieces at one of the levels you're allowed access to. Finally, you group these artifact pieces into completed artifacts, which you display in the museum for points.

Despite the simple rules, there are quite a few decisions to make. There is a variable amount of money up for grabs each turn. You know what the range might be, but not what the exact amount is. Money is taken in order by the spots players choose, so you have a "press your luck" element, do I place early and make sure I get $x, or do I go late and get all the remaining money, which might be more? As well, there's also the fight for first access to a given level, so a later player might willingly take less money to get early access to a prime artifact level, scooping you and taking all the good stuff.

The way artifacts come in differing pairs, forcing you to match them all up in a large "train" also makes for interesting decisions. An artifact of lesser value but the right type can often work better in sequence with your other items, allowing you to get more items of lesser value displayed, giving you more points.

Just pleasing in all ways.

A simple, but repetitive, euro with two players (four might be more interesting). Bid for tiles - placing your piece either side of the dummy player. Get money or not. Buy tiles. Make tiles into exhibits. Rinse and repeat for 16 or so turns.

I was very very very bored, even though I won. For trade after one play.

There are some interesting things going on in this game, but I'm starting to wonder if "interesting things" are enough to keep me very interested in a game.  There's nothing particularly new or original here, and it's not better due to the sum of its parts.  The action selection track is a nice balancing mechanism, but it's so hard to control a lot of the rest of the stuff in the game to make it feel more than just a nice little pastime on occasion.  It's not horrible, but it's not great, either.  It's just a very middle-of-the-road game, and one that I wouldn't expect to get a lot of table time in the future.

I enjoyed this one.  I liked the research fund track and the way you had to gamble a bit with the money you wanted to earn while also watching the levels where you would be able to dig.  The board had a nice look to it, and I really liked the uniquely shaped tiles.  The admission ticket victory point tiles were neat, and I liked the way the shape of the dig tiles tied into gameplay.

RATING: 6
Pergamon is sort of a push-your-luck and set collection mash-up. At the start of each turn, players are give a possible range of pay-outs from 4 to 12 gold. They then get in line, the farther back they go, the larger the portion of the money they get. Players who chose to go earlier get their money first, albeit a smaller amount. Still, it is very possible that a player going late in turn order will get none of the money they were promised, if it happens to be a small number and all of it has already been claimed.

Once the money situation is resolved, players use the money they earned to buy artifacts, which are printed on puzzle tiles. By putting these puzzle tiles together, artifacts are completed and given an age, so they can be collected and put into a museum. Once displayed, the artifacts generate victory points every few turns until the museum patrons get tired of visiting it.

That's it really. This a very fast game and quite elegant, much simpler than its elevator pitch. It reminds me a lot of Thebes, another game of digging for buried treasures of the ancient world. It's not quite as entertaining as that title, but it plays a lot faster and with less luck, since you are drafting tiles instead of pulling them blind out of a bag. If that sounds like the better option, this might be the Archaeology game for you.

Great game with a combination of simple mechanics that make the game play interesting and thinky without being overly complex. Turn order and decisions here are especially interesting....

I just love it, it's a great alternative to playing another great game, Thebes, because I feel it can play a little faster.

A fast light simple clean game with a nice sort of "bidding" (or whatever else u might want to call it more appropriately). Only problem is probably the luck factor of the cards but that is a small issue if u accept it from the beginning.

I like that this game is relatively peaceful, without any overt attacking. It can still have frustrating moments when a player is unable to acquire enough money to purchase a needed artifact due to the press-your-luck nature of the funding.

We are archeologists getting funding to dig up relics to put on display at the museums.  The older more valuable relics are a deeper dig and require greater funding. We totally dig this game and have a lot of fun with the theme.  Turn order positioning also determines funding has a nice gambling aspect.  There is a fun sub-game puzzle figuring the best combination of your relics for exhibit.

I love the timing needed in this one. If you place your pawn late in the turn order, you may not get much money or you may get a windfall. Either way, you are choosing early in the next round. If you have saved up, you can usually get a bunch of good stuff that round. If not you may have to go after the money again. Watching the others as they build exhibits and being able to time yours is also important. Nice little game.

Un entretenido juego para 2 a 4 personas. Con 2 jugadores entra el juego el ladrón de tumbas, que actúa como un tercer jugador. En cada turno se descubren nuevos hallazgos, que deberán comprarse para formar colecciones que luego deberán exponerse en el museo de Pergamon. Las mejores colecciones recibirán un mayor número de visitas, que se traducen en puntos de victoria, así que tendremos que conseguir las piezas más antiguas para despertar el interés de los visitantes del museo. Se trata de un juego sencillo, vistoso y muy entretenido de jugar, tiene su miga y su pizca de estrategia. Recomendable.

Bumped along this game, and it looked interesting to us immediately. The theme was different then most of the games. The artwork was nice. This was a game that we wanted to play. It was a big surprise when this game arrived at home as a gift. Printed out the Dutch rules, and placed it on the shelves. We had to try other new games, that even looked more interesting. Finally there was the day that we started to play this one. When playing with just two, a virtual third player joins the game. Most of the time we don’t like virtual players, but sometimes it works. In this game it worked. Mainly because the only goal for the virtual player is to block some opportunities and receive money, and but artifacts before you can. Despite the virtual player doesn’t show his collection (which make that other players collection devalue less quickly), it just works. Pergamon isn’t a game for people who expect a deep thinking game. This really is a family game. We think this one is fun with all number of players. Didn’t expect this game, but after playing it, it was clear. This one hit bulls eye.

First impression.  There are some unusual mechanisms in here, but they can be simply brutal.  Of course, since you're gambling, it's technically under your control, and the mechanisms are mostly self-compensating.  The unfortunate part is that you still get some pretty big luck-of-the-draw swing in points.  I suspect this is all mitigated with experience, though, and I look forward to playing this some more.

La casilla superior en la que te posiciones determina el dinero que recibirás y cuan profundo podrás escavar (si eres muy ambicioso podrías recibir $0). Al escavar recibes trozos de artefactos. Cuando los completes podrás exponerlos en el museo para obtener PV.

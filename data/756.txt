RATING: 4
I'm not really into deduction style games. I think in execution the alphabet agents are interesting, but a little too generic to allow for interest/ distinction in my mind.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Pretty much Cluedo (Clue) without all the faff of wandering around a board. Still pretty luck-related, though - You cannot frame your own accusations, but must pick from 3 stacks, which gives a huge benefit for players with a suspect that has all its cards at the bottom of the piles. Plus huge frustration when you have narrowed down to a couple of letters, but there are no cards to ask for them. And if someone makes a mistake, it ruins the game for everyone.

So good, but far from flawless.

RATING: 10
Not for everybody, but if you're in to the whole hardcore deduction thing, this one is a joy.  Except for when you discover, about 2/3 of the way through, that someone (you, even) screwed up their record-keeping and messed the whole game up for everyone else:)

RATING: 6
+ Extremely simple in concept, and the most honest and harshest deduction game I've played so far. The one who does the best bookkeeping is the most likely to win. 
- It's more an activity than a game. Has a bit too much of luck involved. During my first game, I was dealt a card that had 3 of my 6 suspects, giving me a big disadvantage from the early game.

This is based on playing my home-made version of the game.  This takes all the stuff I love about Clue and Sudoku and mashes them together to make a rather enjoyable logic game.  It can be slightly disappointing when everybody failurizes and nobody figures out who the correct culprits are, though.  (Just need to learn how to take better notes.)  This game is good stuff, though.  Definitely recommend if you like logic games.

Great deduction game, maybe the best ever. Pure logic. Does suffer from the same thing all deduction games do, namely that a careless or inattentive player can ruin the game.

RATING: 7
Fun deduction game.  Much better than Clue.  Somewhat less brain & labor intensive than Sleuth.  **UPDATE**  This game doesn't offer as much deductive reasoning as Sleuth.  You definitely reach a point where you have narrowed down the last letter to one of two choices... and you must simply chug through the draw stacks until the right letter appears... an easy fix might be to allow the "ask any one question" then make your guess rule that is found in Sleuth.  Probably plays better with 4 or more players... my recent 3-er game felt too easy.

Deduction and logic - makes a nice quick game, although I'd prefer it without the random element. Bit frustrating when you want to eliminate a letter but don't have the card available to do it.

RATING: 9
I really liked this game after 1 play, and now think that it's the best deduction game we have played to date (better than sleuth, mystery train, abbey, clue, etc).  

The great part about this game is that there are points where everyone must rush to come to conclusions because it's very possible that the final answer is now workable by more than one player.   The flip side is that this also means that players are more prone to error, and error in this game is almost unfixable.  A game where you need to be both careful and fast is a well designed game and it allows for some good end-game tension.   

Something that none of us did but that we could have done if you thought other players were close would be to take your turn faster, hopefully confusing other players and giving them less time to deduce and letting you catch up.   In 8 guesses in 2 games now, 7 of them have been wrong, and all 8 players have messed up.  That indicates this is a nicely tricky game.
  Initial rating a 9.

Good stuff here, I really enjoy this deduction game, and it's different enough from Sleuth as well.  I want to get the real version, but it's waaaaay to expensive.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
In my opinion, this is one of the best deduction games out there.  It's too bad no one has reprinted it.  It's also too bad that many of the games played end up aborted because someone wasn't paying full attention and made a mistake.  In this game a mistake will ruin the game for everyone, not just the person making the mistake.

RATING: 8
I finally crafted a homemade version, and I play constantly on Greg Aleknevicus' play-by-web site.  My favorite play, when I can pull it off, is when I can get the solution a turn before everyone else by divining by the questions they ask - and don't ask - what the solution is.  Clearly I cannot choose the cup in front of me!

I love deduction games.  And deduction games that everyone loses just seem that much cooler.  I would play this game more if I have the chance.  Definitely a brain-burner.  Don't play this if you don't like deduction.  It is not so much a game as a joint logic puzzle.

Excellent deduction yumminess!  Personally, my favorite part is coming up with words or pseudo-words for the question cards.  I have to say that altho I love playing this game, the winner is most often times determined by luck, because how the cards come out and how they can help you (or not help you), is kinda random.  I've played this well over a dozen times, and would gratefully do so again anytime...

RATING: 1.9
A deduction game that requires everyone to really, really, really pay attention?  My first play of this, someone at the table screwed up about halfway through, and marked something incorrectly.  He boned us.  From what I gather, that's a typical Black Vienna Experience.

A tour de force deduction game. In the pure deduction game category, this reigns as king. Don't ever play sleuth again, this is superior in every way.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Excellent deduction game.  A little simpler than Sleuth since there are fewer variables and easier to track.  I've only played once and look forward to my next play.  I'm a little worried that it may all come down to note-taking.  If everyone is perfect w/their note-taking, I think 2 or more players will discover the missing letters at the same time.  In Sleuth, some of the information revealed is private so this is less likely to occur.  I could see bumping Black Vienna up to an 8 though if more games reveal similiar note-taking schemes but not multiple winners.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Players are trying to deduce the three members of the Black Vienna crime syndicate. Three cards are set aside at the beginning of the game, this is the crime gang. The rest of the characters are dealt out, and players take turns asking questions in the form of three character question cards. Answers are based on the number of characters you're holding in your hand. Soon the logic kicks in and the solution snowballs towards you. Some concerns in that the way the questions appear can cause you to deadlock, meaning you're forced to take a guess before someone else solves it.  Rating dropped a couple of points - fun to play, but it does have some serious problems regarding deadlock.

[9 plays] Excellent deduction game.  Black Vienna belongs to the same deductive genre as Clue, Sleuth, Mystery of the Abbey, Mystery Express, and others: remove some cards from a deck and interrogate each other to find out which ones they are.  There's an espionage theme, but it doesn't go very deep.
Although Black Vienna is hopelessly OOP, it's one of the easiest games ever to make a homebrew copy of.  There's also an excellent online implementation.

A great deduction game with a clearly pasted on theme. It reminds me in a way of a reverse Code 777: everyone shares a lot of information, but each person also has information that only they know. They also both require careful note-taking, which could be a turn-off to some.

The game is simple and elegant, and we have really been enjoying the online incarnation created by Greg Aleknevicus, found here: http://www.aleknevicus.com/bv/index.php.

Very interesting deduction game.  A large puzzle that needs to be figured out.  But, book keeping is a nightmare.  We've played it twice and both times no one won.  In some cases note taking was the downfall.

The more and more we play this, the more I enjoy it.  It is just as much an exercise in book keeping though.  

Once you realize you marked something wrong, you end with you head banging against the table.

I prefer Deduce or Die; Deduce allows for a secret question mechanic and being able to ask your own questions. Still this can be a good introduction game to pure deduction games.

The deck is letters of the alphabet + umlauted O (27 cards). Three cards are put off to the side, the rest are distributed among the players. The goal is to figure out what the three cards are first.

Initial Rating: 8.0 (April 2011)

What a great game.  With each play the rating goes up. Very near my top 10 of games.

This hardcore deduction game requires total concentration by the players, when we play we are all looking at our page seeking clues and deducing, almost no talk in the table, tense atmosphere, but it is a blast to play and I love it :D.

The rules are very simple to explain and master but it is ultra-hard to win (many times the games has ended without any victorious player), also it has a fair amount of luck. The only bad the game has IMO, is that it takes 1 wrong answer to kill the game (there is an online implementation that fix this but I have not played it yet). 

Bottom line my favorite deduction game (way better than Mystery of the Abbey) but this is not everyone. Try it before you buy it.

I have played 11 times (and won only 2 I think) and it is still a GREAT game. I’m upgrading this to a 9.5. I always want to play it. I’m getting better at it as I discovered new ways to analyze the information and I now have into account the psychological aspect of the game :D.

Its great weakness is that a mistake can kill the game, however I really encourage you to try it. I love it.

Perhaps I’m spoiled but I prefer to play with 4 players, with 6 the game is long and the odds to get something worthwhile decreases, the players need to investigate carefully or we all lose.

I love the game, I’m downgrading its rating so it matches my feelings for the game with the BGG rating system. Black Vienna is a 9.0 for me, an excellent game that I always want to play.

I’m currently making my Top 100 favorite game list for the first time, so I’m comparing games in a way I haven’t before. Now I see that I have some games that I prefer to play over Black Vienna (but they aren’t many), due to this I’m downgrading its rating once again. Still I consider Black Vienna to be a great game and it was my number 1 deduction game for a long time. I even prefer it over Alchemists.

one of the best deduction games around, but it can really be thrown off if a player makes an error with the somewhat complicated information process.  if an error does happen, everyone is just flushing time, they just do not know it yet.  i rate it a 9 if no one makes a mistake, but because this does happen with decent frequency i am going to dock it 2.5 points.

Black Vienna is my favourite deduction game. It's quick and fun. As the answers remain on table, Black Vienna doesn't require complicated note-taking. Thinking is required, however, and careful attention is necessary, otherwise the game will be spoiled.

There's some luck involved, as sometimes your choice of questions is badly limited. I accept that luck, because it gives the game other, more pleasant qualities. Also, when playing for 40 points, the game can end with no solution. That's fairly unusual, though, and I find the 40-point limit a good way to end the game if it seems to drag.

Suggest.

Decent deduction game. I think I like this more than the game of Deduce or Die I played but less than Salem but probably need to replay them all.

As usual, I hate the player elimination, but otherwise think it's solid (albeit plagued with the same issues of almost all other deduction games like if you accidentally check the 3 suspects cards and can no longer play). 

Oh small gripe, but I do wish the game didn't require paper and pencil, haha. But that's very minor a nitpick.

Edit played many more times and enjoy more and more. Scales well 3 and 4 and I suspect 5 and 6 will be even better. It's simple and elegant and can get beginners in quickly, and it's a fascinating game. Easier than most other hardcore deduction games but that helps it's accessibility and elegance. Only nitpick is I play with a non player elimination variant where we all flip our guesses at the same time but a fun game with some pretty fun thinking and logic that I enjoy and will readily play.

Would like to try more deduction games too.

EDIT: After more plays, I played 6p once and it was HARD. I got none of the 3 and others only got 1 or so at most. I also play with a non-player elimination variant which IMO keeps the crux of the game. It makes me wonder if I should try more elimination games but try to obtain non-elimination variants. Hmm...I want to try to find a replacement game one day though, without elimination and official rules.

Good deduction game. Most of information is available on board all the time. I like it more with 3-4 people than with 6 (only tried once). With six it was a quite masochistic experience, and that was not _totally_ because of an error in selfmade cards...

Famous for being one of the banner children for fragile games. No matter how much you stress how important is to check and re-check that you're not making mistakes, it seems inevitable that most games will have a breakdown with a mistake made. Which is a shame because the deducation element is pretty cool, although the game ends up revolving around how many cards you can get buried elsewhere before they can be played on you and you're required to give away info you're trying to keep hidden.

Black Vienna is Zendo and Clue mashed together and injected with steroids. Each player gets a few cards of suspects that they can rule out.  Then players take turns using cards that have a three suspects on them to try to determine which suspects no one has. It's hard. It's intense.  It's a whole lot of fun.

The slow drip of information can really make this game drag. Once you learn the proper way to keep notes and track clues it's just a matter of time. It's not the worst deduction game out there, but I'm not convinced it's worth a recommendation either.

Good deduction game, but prone to ending due to player error rather than a correct deduction.  Doesn't seem to be a huge scope to win advantage over other players other than by devising better note keeping systems.

--June2006-- Nice clue-weight deduction game - with 3 or 4 players, it's about as brain-burning as 2 or 3 player Sleuth.  My children were amused, and I enjoyed it too:  well worth "manufacturing."   Can't quite recommend it with 5 players, though; we ran out of investigation cards before things were settled.

Fantastic deduction game - a good note-taking system is important, and there's enough strategy that I still haven't figured out.
However recent games have not worked out, this game is very unforgiving to mistakes  - one error by one person can make the game unsolveable for everyone.

Too much work. Unlike deduction classics like Mastermind, this concept is more one of effective note taking. There's a mass of information and s/he who can get their mind around it all with the cleverest note taking system will be in the running to win. But why? I would rather play a fun game.

I played a homemade version of this Clue-style deduction type card game at Tennessee Game Days 2008.  This was a six-player game.  The really couldn't figure out how I was supposed to calculate the answer.  I think it has to do with all the cumulative cards and chips information situated in front of each player, but some of the cards move.  Apparently, additional players can really make the game quite difficult.  A six-player game appeared quite challenging, but I think it should be rather difficult.

RATING: 7
It is strange to mix this much luck with an equal amount of serious deduction, but for some reason it works.  This is a bit of an overwhelming brainburner until you figure out how to take proper notes to match what is going on in your head.  For as lovely as the system is BV is quite dry, we insist on a house rule where you must read the cards out phonetically.  It makes this move from a 6 rating to a 7 when asking "Excuse me sir, but I'm going to have to see your Gehpix [GPX] please."

There isn't much reason that this shouldn't in print.  That said it isn't much of a loss to make your own copy.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Interesting, difficult, and unforgiving game.  If someone mistakenly lays the wrong number of chips on a card, everyone else is screwed and if you make an error in your own note-taking, you're doomed.  Very sudoku-like.  I'll happily play again if (a) I can convince others and (b) everyone is accurate enough to enable the game to proceed successfully. 

Homemade copy (resized PDF to 80% to fit on standard card blanks).  Scoresheet available here did us more harm than good.  Developing a good notetaking system is essential for playing this game.

[DIY] {Agent; deduction; optimal 4-5p} Black Vienna is a tactical deduction game in the genre of Sleuth. It's quite interactive and allows different style of plays like hiding and bluffing. It's not only a competition of deduction logical capacity.  The "timing" factor makes this game different from other games and it makes the game become more exciting at late game.  It's a good game but I think it's more suitable for gamers than to families.

I would like to get an actual copy.

Somehow this makes bookkeeping and accounting fun.  It throws in some probabilities, and creates a nifty game.  Its essentially Clue with cards, but it eliminates the roll and move mechanic and just leaves everything fun with the game.  Excellent game design.  Its a challenge to have more information than everyone at the table.  A fine race to solve the mystery.

Deep brain burner of a deduction game.  Takes careful (and lots) of note taking.  Kinda neat though.

I was pretty disappointed with this venerable old deduction game.  It was pretty boring and uninspired.  You simply get 6 hidden letters each, and try to figure out the 3 letters that nobody got dealt.  You do this by taking turns giving a three letter set to an opponent and they have to tell you how many of those letters they have.  So you sit around doing this for a bunch of turns, and then eventually you can pin down exactly what letters no one has.  I can't imagine this being fun for anybody.

My favorite "straight" deduction game.  Much, much better than Sleuth or Clue.

The restrictions on questions and the jockeying that occurs when someone is ready to accuse improves the core "deduction by spreadsheet" mechanics a lot.  (Everyone has a minute to decide if they also want to accuse and go for a tie (assuming the first player has it right); the fact that someone is willing to accuse signals information that may help you make that final deduction.)

The rules I was taught and use are a popular "folk version" that evolved partly due to mis-translation and are slightly different from the designer's intended rules

RATING: 6
A pretty dry but pure deduction game. It's fun to puzzle out just what exactly in the way of information you are getting from certain questions, especially those asked by and of others, but a lucky question draw can throw the game to one person pretty easily. If you're at all interested in this game you should totally make yourself a copy because there's really nothing to it. You don't even need a printer, you could just take a sharpie to deck of cards if you're that budget.

My favorite deduction game.  There are 27 criminals represented by the 27 letters in the alphabet (don't forget the o with two dots :).  The 3 criminals you want to catch are removed and the remaining ones are dealt out to the players.  These are the criminals you know didn't do it.  There are three stacks of "questions" you use to querry other players about what they know.  The questions are in the form of 3 letters.  For each criminal they have represented on the question they put a stone, i.e. 0-3 stones.  From their responses and even the questions they ask, you deduce who has what criminals and by deduction the 3 remaining ones.

A difficult deduction game which gives you an enjoyable brain workout. My first two plays resulted in nobody correctly guessing the suspects. Even with a good notation system, you may require some leaps of faith to be able to pick the right three suspects before the in-game time limit runs out. Recommended if you like logic puzzle or games such as Sleuth or Code 777.

At the time of writing, it's not in print but it's pretty easy to put together a copy yourself from the files section of its BGG page. I made my own version using Legendary creatures from Magic: The Gathering as the suspects. The standard theme is criminal investigation in post-war Austria, players working to discover the identities of three members of the 'Black Vienna' gang. It's quite fun to imagine three unlikely Magic characters forming this gang.

Deduction games with a nice theme is a rare find for me, so Black Vienna seemed like a good fit.  The rules are fairly simple, but for some reason in our 3-player game all of us messed up on our evidence sheet one time or another, marking down suspects that weren't suppose to be there.  My only problem came towards the end of the game, when you've figured out maybe 95% of the list with only 2-3 to choose from, a lot of the interrogation cards become useless.  You could continue by hoping the right one turns up, but by that time I just wanted the game to be over with so I'd force a guess.  I am curious if it plays better (as in harder) with more people.

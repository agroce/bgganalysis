This is a nice simultaneous selection game, with a good theme, thematic abilities for the different creatures, and fantastic artwork. I also like the simple resolution for ties. The one issue I have here is that the rounds can feel repetitive, even if the game is short, so I wish there were some sort of stacking or evolving shift in the creature decks or Mortals through the subsequent rounds. I'll usually replace the Invisible Man in round 2 or 3 with Demogorgon for at least some minor alteration.

Otherwise, a very solid entry to this genre.

Nice game, this is fast, easy to take with you anywhere.
This ard game is based on bluffing and trying to deduce what the other will play to get the best available cards in play.
The pace is fast with a lot of entertainment.

This is a competitive game for 2 to 5 players and even with 2 players the game can be fun!

I normally do not like bluffing and social deduction games, but this one was kind of fun. The 1950s B horror movie inspired artwork was gorgeous and really helped sell the game.  Not one I'd play often, but every once in a while, it's fun.  A decent filler game - a lot of game in a small box.

This game is somehow both light and easy while also being very deep and pretty intense. It's a great game to break out either with newcomers, who may not be ready for a game as heavy as Arkham Horror or Dead of Winter, or when you want to play a quick game without a lot of setup. Campy Creatures will sit right alongside Coup and whatever flavor of Love Letter you prefer. It's small, compact, can easily be played in half an hour even with new players, has gorgeous artwork, a surprisingly deep layer of strategy, and is a lot of fun.

This one seems to be getting better with time.  9 year old loves it. I would not recommend it as a 2 player game.  It works much better at 3 and up because additional cards come into play.  The art work is just gorgeous.  Highly interactive and fun.

I could see this moving up to a 9. Easy to teach - distilled gameplay that has you really trying to get into the heads of other players while still reserving room for strategy. Looks great. Has the rare, but important, quality among games in that it's actually EXCITING. It's a really fun moment to flip everyone's cards up. There's no downtime like in more brainy programming games where you have to think about the implications of the moves, it's just an instant feeling of "Yes!" or "No!!!!!!!!" as you compare numbers and check to see if your strategy planned out. The tie-breaking component in this game is one of the best and most interesting I've every seen - such a simple idea that I'm surprised I haven't seen it in more places. Plays well at only 2p too, but I like it with more.

RATING: 7
A solid light card game for people that arent too serious about winning due to in game chaos.  Playing 3 rounds might be a bit long, but not by much.  The art is amazing.  A game for casuals and serious gamers to play on near equal footing due to secret card reveals.  The chaos increases as you add more players and who is next to you makes a difference in your gameplay.  This game is more about the journey than the destination as card choices and its consequences can garner fun conversations in game.  Playing with familiar friends and light-hearted people add to the fun.  There is a place for this game in a serious game group for a round or two of filler fun.  A rare game that has broad appeal with a slightly long run time at 3 rounds, of course you could house rule for less rounds.

Love the artwork.  Good, quick, light game.  Not something I will play multiple times per session, but will enjoy as a light filler on occasion.

RATING: 8
Light deduction with a strong focus on predicting opponent's moves, Campy Creatures is a quick card game that takes inspiration from For Sale! and battle cards from games like Lord of the Rings Confrontation and Blood Rage. Additionally, each card has a special ability. Countering normally comes down to two choices: Win through card ability finesse or win through card power brute strength. Only one will successfully counter your opponent. To give some information to the decision, players can see what has been played throughout the game. This is another of the rare gems that is light and fun but also captures the feeling of playing against an opponent. Decisions get more head-to-head as the game continues as tensions rise.

Comparing this to Love Letter is imprecise. Libertalia meets Rock Paper Wizard is a better comparison and my short-review is that I prefer playing RPW over this. Campy Creatures has dynamite artwork. But I'd buy the cards for the art alone & skip the game. 

Players each have a hand of the same nine Monster cards, numbered 0-9. Each Monster card depicts a different creature with a different power. There are Calvinball-like powers assigned every single card. Kaiju are 8 points, which is the highest monster value you can play per round. Mummy cards are 3 but they trump Kaiju if played in the same round. Beast Cards are Strength 7, but if you don't play it in a round you'll gain +3 points at the end. Vampires and Werewolves cancel a player's power. Blob cards are Strength 0 + the strength value of any other unplayed Monster card in your hand. 

Monsters prey on Mortals. The most points acquired through Mortal cards determines the winner.

A tableau of Mortal cards are dealt face up each round, one per player. Mortals are assigned point values (negative or positive). Some have variable scoring powers: "Teenagers" only score you if you acquire the most of them, for example. Another card grants you positive points if you have an even amount of Mortal cards, negative points for an odd count of Mortals. Some are straight-up negative points (Hunters and others), so not every card in each tableau is equal.

Each hand, players choose one Monster card and all are revealed simultaneously. First the concatenation of each hand's variable Monster powers are resolved, and then players capture a Mortal card from the tableau, choosing in Monster Strength order from highest to lowest. Lather, rinse, repeat. 

The problem with Calvinball games is that each "collision" of player cards each round grinds the game to a halt while players first work out the timing of card powers. Unless there's a tie, which is another Calvinball-type fillibuster before you even get to card powers in the form of the Clash-O-Meter.

The Clash-O-Meter has each player's color and is randomly determined to start. It's like the possession arrow in college basketball. When two or more players play the same monster card, the higher-most player on the Clash-O-Meter 1) wins the tie, then 2) moves to the bottom of the meter. Other players involved in the tie do not matter and do not move on the meter. Needless to say, this is super non-intuitive to remember, and it comes up virtually every hand in higher player counts.

The problem with Calvinball Mechanics - aka "just put a bunch of powers in a room and let them collide and who knows what combos will arise?" - is that in this game  there are several exceptions nested into every rule. It's like distilling every argument two Magic the Gathering players have ever had about a card on the table in a tournament, into every round of the game. 

Literally one hand during our game went like so: "Kaiju is 8 points, UNLESS you have the Mummy card, UNLESS you played a Blob and absorbed the Kaiju, UNLESS three of you at the table played the same card so let's go to the Clash-O-Meter where only ONE of you moves down in future tie order and gets to go first. Oh wait the Vampire negated your card's power... we have to start again." 

If you manage to avoid the standoffs in a given round, you are just waiting for everything to resolve so you can take the last card - which is usually 90% predictable. There aren't a lot of choices in Campy Creatures when you finally peel back the onion layers and finally get to one.

The excessive fiddliness in Campy Creatures and its nesting dolls of rule exceptions moves the game well past what a light filler should be doing. The game suggests five rounds, but our first round took 25 minutes due to the built-in haggling over timing and ties each round, which is far too long for the hoops that the game puts you through. It felt like it was baked into gameplay, which is anathema to a game, to our group, and to me as a player. 

I came in first place with a huge last hand - basically saving all my big value cards for the end because I knew everyone else exhausted their heavy hitters early, which is a textbook feature in Munchkin and for our group an unwelcome comp to Campy Creatures. I never enjoyed a moment of winning the game, nor playing it. It felt wildly chaotic for little return, and after the dust settled each turn it felt pre-programmed with the actual game parts completing in bookkeeping nanoseconds.

For those that like the idea of this game, I'd suggest Rock Paper Wizard - a fast, fun chaotic filler that does everything better than this does.

Kickstarted. Nice simultaneous selection game.

++ Amazing retro horror movie poster artwork. 
-    Feels very repetitive. Anymore than one playthrough feels like a slog.
-    Needs some kind of evolving mechanic during the rounds to increase tension/variety.

Ultimately sold from my collection. There are so many small box cards games out there. This one is neither short and entertaining enough to get the 'let's play again' feeling afterwards, nor presents enough choices during gameplay to feel satisfying.

Rarely do you find good game design and graphic design in the same package. Almost always in the game industry you either get one or the other. Keymaster Games seems to be bucking that trend. This is the first game of theirs and immediately bought it after playing. The mechanics are simple and fun, making the game a great filler. The graphic design is some of the best in the business and my hat is off to the folks at KG. I will definitely be keeping my eye on Keymaster Games going forward.

Possibly the best game to take on a trip. The art is fantastic - I can't stress it enough. The game is quite simple but actually not shallows at all. I've only played it with my better half so far but even in a two player game I find that you can't really get stuck into a single winning tactic because your opponent constantly adapts as well and you start trying to double-guess what you think they double-guessed :)

Fast-playing and easy to learn. Artwork and theme REALLY make the game in this. Even my roller derby teammates, who only play the games I force them to play and only if they are not too difficult, really got into this.

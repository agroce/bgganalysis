A great two player game.  The theme is fun, the mechanics are loose but fun.  Just a very enjoyable game.  Yeah, luck can play a huge part in this game, but there is some strategy to it as well.  Has a bit of a chess feel at times, but I think that's a pretty unique feel that a lot of games don't really use.  Lots of fun, don't let the low rating detract you from it.  Good for younger gamers AND adults!

Good fun.  I like the unequal sides and you should play twice with both players trying both sides.

Hunters have a slight advantage, but not much.

A bit chess like, but with blockers (trees) that can be removed and a bit of luck at the start.

You can also decide how quickly things end by turning over tiles quickly or slowly, and position your pieces so that they can leave the board easily when you sense that the game end is near.

Yes, not every game is balanced, but some intense online plays have convinced me that if you actually keep score and not just look at win/lose only that there is enough skill requirement here to keep me challenged. Plus, come on, Rüdiger Hoffmann.

This game features an interesting asymmetric aspect of game play.  Each player's side has different rules covering movement and actions.  This can often lead to balance issues, but it works quite well in this game.  Because of the different rules, it is best to play 2 games, switching sides for each game.  A better than average game in the Kosmos 2-player series.  [GTI Code: AGSL]

Light game whose random setup can seriously hose one player, but the fact that setup is hidden helps balance out the game during play (if only by luck and a little bit of strategy as to what tile to choose to turn over given what has already been revealed, and what gives you the best possible options or your opponent the least possible options).  I'm not too fond of the amount of luck involved in set-up, and I'm not too fond of discovering the board in pieces given the set-up.

RATING: 5.5
I was pretty disappointed to find out how random this game can be. If all the majority of the hunters have guns pointing the wrong way, you have not chance to beat the foxes and bears. The lumberjacks weakly move 1 space to pick up trees worth only 2 points each.

In my quest to acquire all that is in the Kosmos 2 players series, I acquired this game. In my two plays of Tally Ho! there seemed to be some things evident; there is randomness based on set-up and probably a balance issue in which the better side seemed to be with the hunter and lumberjack. 

I need more plays to assert my opinion, but I have a feeling of 'Meh'.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
The theme is pretty cool.  There is a whole lot of luck with tile flipping, but there is also a lot of strategy, especially if the board gets cleared out a bit.  An open board favours the the humans more.  At any rate, I once played a game that ended 69-68 for me, with all of this cool out-maneuvering and end game planning and strategizing which was just this absolutely, incredibly fun experience.  Other times, the game is over pretty much before it starts.  It's more strategic than you would think, but the luck factor just gets too obscene at times, which makes the enjoyment of your play experience completely at the mercy of random tile placement.  Personally, I'd rather play a game that's fun all the time.

This is a cute, little 2 player game with a chess-like play to it together with a bunch of randomness in board setup.  I'll need more plays, but the first time through was fun and my wife liked it too.

After our third play, my wife liked it less but I still think it's a cute abstract with random setup and asymmetrical sides.  For a 10-15 minute game, it's perfect for me.

I expected worse from Halali yet I had to make up my mind quickly: although pretty limited, it is an enjoyable game with a wink to the light side and even some strategy in it.

As tiles placement is random and their orientation can't be changed since it influences gameplay, some players could turn up their nose at this game: anyhow, it's undoubtable it plays well as a quick two-player filler.

I respect this game as a kind of grandfather of modern boardgames because it has 36 years. But honestly, there are nothing more here. The set up is as random than it can make one player to be totally blocked during all the game. So is better and faster throw a coin to the air and determine the winner of a game than spend 20 minutes of your life with this. My first play was disastrous, wonder how Kosmos made a reedition 20 years later.

RATING: 2.5
I don't know what on earth possessed me to acquire this stupid, dated game. The heavy luck element means you have little control over what happens on your turn: you might find yourself handing your opponent a kill every time you turn over a tile (which I seemed to do quite a lot). 

At first glance the hunters seem overpowered and too numerous, and the animal character seems to be at a huge disadvantage. I imagine with more plays I would feel differently, but fortunately, I will never, ever play this game again.

Surprisingly good. Moderate luck factor. Manipulating the hunters so as to create "line of sight" barriers is fun. Moving the green pheasants and ducks to block in opponent's pieces is also fun.

RATING: 8
A really fun two player game!

Essentially, you either flip a tile, or move a flipped tile on your turn.  If you're the humans, you're trying to shoot any animals (with your hunters) or chop trees (with your lumberjacks).  If you're the animals, you're trying to eat humans (with your bears) or eat the birds (with your foxes).  Essentially, it turns into a chess-like match where you try to outmaneuver your opponent, except way simpler than chess.  The randomness of the tile flips often also swings the game one way or the other, making it less so that the most skilled player will win every time.

In the end, a bit random, but I really like it for reasons I can't quite put my finger on!

It is quite some fun to play: fox eats duck, hunter shoots fox, bear kills hunter - har har! Its nice to have a game where humans are not at the end of the food chain.

Moves can sometimes become quite tricky, since the rule that you can never undo your move of your previous turn requires you to look ahead 1-3 turns in some situations, but often it seems that luck alone decides the entire outcome of the game.

Tally ho is a simple concept game strictly designed for two players. At first look, it seems so simple like a child's game. However you will quickly find that it takes quite a bit of strategy to play this game well. Gameplay is fairly fast, and it's actually light enough for a nice little filler.

Fun light game. Great for kids! Has some similarity to chess since some of the tiles can move like rooks. Creating and taking advantage of open files for example. There is quite a bit of luck in the beginning but the fun part of the game is making the best out of what is on the board. The end game occurs once all the tiles are revealed and you can score points by moving your own pieces off the board. I found this a bit strange the first few plays but makes for interesting endings.

Complete randomness of the tiles is an issue with this game, but with the right tile distribution it lightly resembles chess.  Nothing is more frustrating in this game than to play as the animals and not have either bear turn up until near the end of the game.  The suggestion to allow players to place several tiles of known value definitely helps to alleviate the randomness.

RATING: N/A
A cute game of 'grid movement' which is probably great fun for the lil' ones, especially if they can do addition. A few tactics are possible, the most important of which are 'tunnel capture' (useful for shooting a bear) and 'discovered attack' which suddenly puts a target in the sights of a hunter without either piece having been moved. It's a good thing the rules insist on swapping sides and then comparing point deltas; although not phrased like that it is a rather Knizian way of doing things, and forces the players to do well on both attempts. I do not need to play this game again soon, but will keep it in mind for when my son is a little older in a few years' time. Because of that planned 'use' I will leave the game unrated.

2007-04: got this in the Boardgaming For Diabetes silent auction

If you accept the game for what it is, it's a cute game.  Initial random tile placement basically makes or breaks you, but as long as you accept this going into the game then there is definitely some fun to be had.  Also, the game is immediately accessible to everyone so it scores points there too.

The concept of this game makes good sense - the hunter and the hunted reversing roles as they circle each other and try to nab mutual targets (i.e. ducks and pheasants).

The problem is that the randomness of the tile layout can make the game very imbalanced.  All it takes is for the animal player to have a bear trapped by trees, and suddenly the game is lopsided.  This imbalance can also result from the order tiles are revealed.

So overall this is a decent idea that is screaming for some rule variants to make it workable.

Seems like a real fun game for kids. Although there is a lot of luck involved, some skill is needed too as I hardly win. The amount of luck can be frustrating though, it's not like it evens out in the end, it usually only gets worse and worse. I learned to ignore this part and playing to maximize scoring even when losing keeps the game enjoyable.

One player takes on the role of hunters, the other player the animals. Face down tiles are gradually revealed on a grid of squares and a tactical chess like game opens up. Hunters capture foxes, ducks, pheasants and bears. Woodsman capture trees - opening up the board. Foxes capture pheasants and ducks, while Bears capture Hunters and Woodsman. Points are awarded based on your captures. Fabulous game that is a nice blend of skill and luck.

Picked this up because it's a 2-player only game. We played the hunters wrong (allowing them to shoot at a distance) and also missed that when one player has removed all their pieces, the game is done, so no additional hunters being removed at the end!

Seems like a neat game once you play it right.

Fast and Fun game that my 5.5 year old son loves.  It has enough depth to engage a more serious gamer while being  approachable enough to be taught to younger kids.

[6 plays] Playing in 2 rounds and switching sides is supposed to even things out, but really the luck of the tile draw is a huge determining factor.  Fun to play even when you don't have much of a chance, though.  Nicely executed as are all the Kosmos series.  I'm glad to have Tally Ho, as it adds some variety and flavor to our two-player repertoire.

My very first game all that was turned over were my foxes and the hunters seemed to be all pointing in the right direction. Basically it was like shooting fish in a barrel. Then when it was my turn to be the hunters none of my tiles were pointing in the right direction, and my 2 lumberjacks were eaten from pretty much the get go, so we were all boxed in by trees and had to finish out the game by just flipping tiles. Or, a bear gets flipped and proceeds to go about decimating my hunters because they are all pointing in the wrong direction...easy pickings. Rinse and repeat for the next 3 games - as in whatever side I play I seem to have a disadvantage and can't find a way to do anything about it. *YAWN* Might be good to play with, or as a present for children, but in general I think it's a waste of time...even for them. I can't believe there are people with over 200 plays. There must be something I'm missing, but with so many other games to play I could kinda care less...

RATING: 7.5
A light but not uninteresting abstract game in an engagingly-produced package. It's simple to set up, simple to teach, quick to play, and has a clever and often critical endgame. It gets a slight points boost because my eldest ADORES it. Speaking of which, it presents a nice level of multi-piece, tactical ("chess-like") challenge for a 7-year-old. He's not "there yet", but you can see him grappling with it, and he does occasionally surprise me. And of course, the random tile distribution is a good thing, both for kids and just to keep the game fresh. Tally Ho is decidedly underrated, but I'm not at all surprised it has been reprinted several times.
Update: My younger child also quite likes this game, and I offered it as a gift to an 8-year-old who immediately fell in love with it.

I love the series of Kosmos 2-player games, and this is another good one.

I generally enjoy tile games because as with this one, the game board changes each time.  Rules are easy, graphics nice, short game.  As a parent/grandparent, a game I enjoy to play with children as young as 5.  

For sure two rounds need to be played, switching colors.  Mechanics of moving & capturing I like.  I think the game appealing.

A very fun, quick and simple game. It can suffer some balance issues, due to the luck of the flipping of tiles, but that doesn't bother me, as it's a lot of fun to play and like I said, it plays quick.

It has kind of a very light chess feel, with how some of the pieces move like Rooks and some people may suffer from AP, but I just play it quickly. It's more fun that way, but the possibilities for deeper play are there, if that's how you want to play the game.

Forget hunters and bears -- it's fate that will often bite you in the ass in this one. Nevertheless, when taken in stride, still generally lots of fun. We play a house variant with an initial placement of four upturned trees, equally spaced one square diagonally in from each corner.

I find this game both irresistable and irritating at the same time, kind of like a bag of Habanero Pepper Potato Chips.

I really enjoy Halali, but I think I understand why many folks don't.  It's a game that has a limited audience because it's at odds with itself.  On one hand, the game is a series of tactical, chess-like positional moves.  On the other hand, the starting locations of the different pieces are random and unknown until someone spends a turn to flip each tile.  So what we have is a real tactical thinker's game, yet the huge amount of luck and chaos will scare off many of the players who like that type of game.  And the luck is indeed huge, sometimes ridiculously so.  "Oh look at that, your bear is penned in by those trees with no way to escape.  Guess you lose."  But the game's quick, and it works more often than not, so I don't mind the occasional wasted game.  If it's important to you that the player who played best wins, then this is not the game for you.

RATING: 4
Clever - has theme, but is really an abstract strategy game (which I generally like).  And I do very much like the fact that it's an asymmetric abstract in which both players have pieces (tiles) of differing abilities - which makes the game different in a good way.

Way more luck (i.e., with the flipping of the tiles) than the average abstract strategy game.  I've won playing both the animals and people, but I've already seen several games where having your "key" tiles get flipped in really bad spots can really put you in big hole.  When the tile flips are of equivalent "advantage" to both players, this game is a "7" or "8" for me.  However, not knowing if your going to get a "good draw" pulls the rating down quite a bit.  [In the worst instances of having your tiles show up in the wrong places, the game could be considered "broken" - i.e., both my bears are trapped behind trees or all my hunters are pointing the wrong way.]

In summary, a game that I keep wanting to like more than I actually do.  Too high a percentage of games where the random set up dooms the game for one side or the other.

Really good 2-person game - fun theme, solid tactical manuevering, very quick (particularly on BSW).

After a few more playings, my initial rating has gone up. I feel, that given an average distribution during setup, the hunter/lumberjacks have a slight edge, so it's best played over a series of games to even out the luck.  A great light filler.

This game could be so good, but it is SO unbalanced.  The animals pretty much have no shot at winning unless a crapload of tiles pop up in the right place, at the right time, AND facing in THE right direction.  Also, since when does a human run faster than a bear???

RATING: 3
Severely flawed game.  You often get deadlock situations where one player cycles one of his guys between 3 squares in a row, and the other player blocks him with one of his guys.   There is no way to resolve these situations - often neither player can back down without losing out big.  Also, there is a tremendous amount of luck, but no probabilistic enjoyment from that luck like there is in many other games.  You are just lucky, or you ain't.  There are some slick tactical maneuvers that you can employ, but since the game changes so quickly, planning is impossible.

RATING: 4
Well I certainly don't appreciate the theme, but at it's heart this game is a mix between cut throat perfect information strategy, and drawing randomly from a bag containing points labeled 'you' and points labeled 'opponent'. It plays quickly so the large random element isn't a huge turn off, but it is pretty funny to have a game with such a huge dichotomy. 

The randomness is in flipping over tiles, which can be anything. You may flip over a hunter who is pointing directly at you (which is bad, unless you're playing the hunters), or you might flip over a pheasant next to your fox (which is good if you're playing the non-human animals). All in all the heavy random element overshadows any strategic fun.

RATING: 3
Gameplay is almost entirely shaped by the random flipping up of tiles. There are some strategies, but fairly brainless ones, e.g. if you turn up an early bear, flip as many adjacent tiles as possible because hunters in them are likely to be facing in the wrong direction. The hunters may be screwed by bad luck, but can often win regardless simply by lining up their pieces for swift evacuation at the end.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I know it's based on a lot of luck, depending on where the cards are and what you turn over first. Still, it's exciting to play. You never know what you're going to get when turning over a card and it's quite a shock when suddenly the bear or a hunter is next to you facing his gun at you as well.
Added comment: the more I think about it, the more strategy I do see in this game. Of course you still have to be lucky with the cards you turn over, but you can move your characters around the board in a very strategic way to get your opponent stuck in a corner.

This game's biggest flaw is the random distribution of tiles. There is a lot of strategy with this once most of the tiles are flipped but before that happens one player could be totally hosed by what gets turned up.  I would recommend making sure you play two games back-to-back with total points to give each player a chance at playing both sides. Despite that I do like this game as I can tolerate the random deployment.

I don't know if I can handle the hugely random swings of luck in this game based on the setup.  Animals seem to be at a huge disadvantage but maybe that was the way it just worked out in my two games thus far or maybe I was missing something in the rules.  The rules aren't well explained/illustrated even for a simple game.  I wanted to like it, but this game just didn't make the grade at this point.

Initial impression is that the game is way too dominated by luck, particularly for the hunter/lumberjack side. Since there is no way to turn the hunters around, and they are blocked by trees, they can just end up "sitting ducks" for the bears. If your lumberjacks or bears are turned over late or are blocked in, they are completely ineffective.

On the other hand, the play is a lot of fun if you can get a nice distribution of pieces so that you can use the lumberjacks/hunters/foxes to clear out the board and get room for strategic maneuvering.

I can imagine smaller children liking the game, as it is pretty random and the little animals are cute.

[b]Cute drawings and fun to play, but there's room for strategy and thinking about future moves. Random tile placement means a high luck component, especially for the hunters, for whom the direction their rifle is pointing to is important. If your luck is really bad, you might be stuck with nothing to do for many rounds, which makes it rather tedious when it happens.[/b]

Played a game with my son in Nov '16, and I have never seen a more lopsided game.  I won like 60-8 playing the hunters, as his bear wound up next to my gun and the second one stick between three trees.  Swapped sides and I won 65-10 or so, as none of his hunters showed up and all my bears ended up next to hunters upon draw.  Do not think he will ever play agin.

A light abstract game but with a decent theme: hunters & lumberjacks versus bears and foxes.  You can move a piece or reveal a new tile.  Basically each tile hunts different pieces (lumberjack "hunts" trees).  Once all tiles are revealed each player has 5 more turns and you can score by exiting the forest or continuing the hunt.  There's a bit of luck but the sort that makes the game exciting, especially considering it only takes 10-20 minutes.  There is the possibility for some strategy too -- setting up some chess-like moves to trap a players piece or protect your own.

Pár játék után nekem úgy tűnik, hogy a medve és a róka nagyobb eséllyel indul csatába. Talán erre a vadász kötöttsége lehet az ok.
Néha egész komoly taktikai harc alakul ki; időnként szinte már úgy érzem, hogy egy sakktábla mellett ülök. Természetesen ez egy, a sakknál nagyságrendekkel egyszerűbb játék, de talán alkalmas arra, hogy gyerekeknél fejlessze a sakkhoz is szükséges gondolkodásmódot.

First play, opponent played hunters. It felt very lopsided but at least we'll switch sides, I thought. Then I played the hunters and they were immediately surrounded by bears and eaten. While I tried to find more, bears and foxes ate most of the birds. By the time I had anything to move I was blocked off from anything good. 

Frustratingly lucky and just not very fun. May be decent with kids but there is little here for adults to enjoy, and with bad luck, it's probably no fun for kids either. Some tile flips might produce some interesting, close games, but just as easily, and in every game thus far for me, it was overwhelmingly unbalanced. Willing to give it another shot, probably with kids. But to call this "light" is almost to give it too much credit. Most of the time it's just bad.

I love games that combine brain burn with complete randomness.  It is too bad not many people feel that way.  This game is very zen.  If you can learn to love this game then you will love life.  To top it off it is wrapped in a violent theme.

Szerintem ez egy tök jó kétszemélyes logikai játék! Kicsit Sakk, kicsit Hive, de különböző képességekkel az ellenfelek között, és egy mozgatható közös, 3. "színnel". Ez szuper! Ugyanakkor a lapkafordítás jókora szerencsét visz a játékba, ezért semmiképpen sem szabad komolyan venni!
Még nagyon szívesen játszanék vele!

RATING: 7
In this 2 player game, one player is the hunter and lumberjacks, and the other player is bears and foxes. Also in the game are trees, pheasants and ducks. All the tiles start face down, covering the map, and on your turn you reveal a tile or move a piece. Hunters only face one direction, but can hunt foxes and bears, while lumberjacks can chop down trees for points. Bears can heat hunters and lumberjacls, while foxes can eat ducks and pheasants.  When the last tile is revealed, players can exit their pieces out of the map to score points as well. 

There is luck in the beginning when you reveal tiles, but can become increasingly tactical.  I didn't realize this game was designed in 1973. It's interesting to play, but as long as you don't mind the luck, it's fun.

A reworking of 1973's Jag und Schlag, Halali! is a light, quick and pleasant ditty where two players have got to move their pieces to take the opponent's (hunters and woodcutters against bears and foxes) and as much "neutral prey" (birds, trees) as they can. Each figure captures in its very own way (woodcutters move one space at a time and cut down trees, foxes hunt birds, bears munch humans and hunters shoot at any animal), and also has its own movement range (woodcutters and bears move orthogonally one space each turn, foxes and hunters move orthogonally but as far as they wish as long as the path is free, trees don't move).

The fact that all pieces are displayed on the board but hidden at the start of the game means that the luck of the draw is huge: players don't know at first even if they're playing a piece of their own. Moreover, the lack of balance inherent to the pieces' distinct nature can be greatly amplified by the (random) distribution of the pieces on the board, since pieces can be trapped by trees and thus rendered useless, or hunters can appear just beside the bear they want to kill (or the other way round). In some rounds the player with the animals is simply doomed to lose.

So, we're left with a charming filler where players can try to use luck for their benefit already after a couple of plays but never fully tame it. It can be fun if taken with a pinch of salt.

I don't even really know why I dislike it soooo much. 
Yes, it's too luck dependent, pretty random and the two sides don't really seem very balanced, so it just never really got to me. But I also can't really figure out what makes it so much worse than other games. Oh well, ...

Edit: I was asked again the other day to play this and it occurred to me that I'd even rather play Monopoly than this, maybe I forgot some traumatic experience I had with this game, but down to the 1 it goes. 

Edit2: Can't even trade it away because my boyfriend likes it actually, well at least the box holds other games in place on the shelf :P

A really cool tile game and one more great title in the Kosmos 2-player games collection! Played it mostly online, which made me want this game. It's great fun, although a lot of luck is involved, since you can't change the direction tiles are facing, which makes it extremely tough for the hunter player at times. Nevertheless a very fun little game!

Tally Ho! is an asymmetric 2-player game where the rules encourage the players to play once as the humans and once as the animals.  The humans try to shoot the animals with their hunters and chop down the trees with the lumberjacks, where the animals try to eat ducks and pheasants with their foxes and the humans with their bears.  In the beginning it's very very random, as the tiles begin randomly-distributed and face-down.  As tiles get flipped and taken, players have more room to maneuver, making it a tactical exercise.  This is okay as a quick 2-player game, but it's just a filler.

TRY Mar/06: Good, silly fun.  Very little strategy.  Very simple to learn & teach, even to kids.  I'm not sure I could envision playing this between adults (more than once for laughs).  Since it is supposed to be an adult game (presumed since part of the 2-player Kosmos line), I'll have to dock it a point.  A 6-7 for kids, but only a 3-4 for adults, in my opinion.

A nice, quick chess-like game with a decent theme.  Success requires both a bit of luck and a bit of planning.
Update:  We ended up giving our copy to the kids to play with.  There's no other game in the house that sees even close the playtime that this one gets from them; at every free moment the now ripped-and-taped-together board comes out, 2 of the boys play against each other, and the other two sit there and cheer for their favorite.  So, the "7" rating is a combination of what I think (5, maybe 6) and what they think (9, maybe 10).

A high luck factor is the only downfall, as there is a pretty big runaway train effect.  Still, the game is cute, clever, and a lot of fun.  My friend Jen described this game as "funky cool checkers."  I agree.

At age 5, it's one of Henry's favorite games.  It's fun to see him slowly catch onto the strategic and tactical elements.  He still has a lot to learn, but his skill is enough now that the luck factor gives him regular wins.  Great game.

Another Kosmos 2p game. This is abstract tile movement and capturing game. Can be very luck dependent. How the hunters flip up can make or break the human roles.

Some of the situations revealed are fun, enhanced by the visuals on the tiles. Some scope for tactics and short term strategy, though tile draw can undermine this but allows players of different abilities to derive some pleasure from the game. Has the Lost Cities syndrome in that play is engaging but the maths involved in play and at game end is a chore.

Fun introductory game that has both significant strategic and tactical aspects; however, luck can override it all. Have a question on movement: does unlimited orthogonal movement mean moving like a rook (my interpretation) or just motoring about as long as nothing blocks the way?

Jogo muito avançado para 1973 mas que ao contrário de outros que na altura não seriam tão destacados, está hoje completamente ultrapassado, pois é bastante dependente do aleatorismo do setup inicial. É possível jogar uma partida interessante, contudo isso é raro, a maior parte das vezes o jogo nasce já decidido, o que o torna irritante. Mesmo nas edições modernas a arte é fraca e não passa de um tabuleiro fraco, com tiles de cartão sem grande beleza. O melhor é mesmo a lição por detrás do jogo!

RATING: 4
This game was plane frustrating.  So much luck with the tile flipping.  It really feels like how the hunter tiles orientation dictates the outcome of the game.  Almost impossible to mitigate bad orientation.  Your opponent needs to make some really bad moves to let them become relevant.    Once the board start to open up there is some strategy but luck of the tile just blows away the mental work involved with  he game.  It don't think the game is broken per say but it's really not fun.

It would probably be too much to say that this is like chess with a random setup, but that is the closest thing I can equate it to.  Like chess, it is fun if you play against someone of equal playing ability.  Playing against someone very good or very bad can make this a very painful experience.  I like the random setup, but there is the chance you could not be able to move any pieces until close to the end of the game and be very behind.  For this reason it gets a 5, but I still like to pull it out on occasion.

I enjoy this most in sets of four (two rounds as humans, two rounds as animals). The game is so fast that I absolutely don't mind the luck of the tiles. A friend of mine is convinced that the humans have a huge advantage, but I'm not so sure. What could be worse than having all your hunters pointing in the wrong direction, or accidentally revealing a bear next to the one damn hunter who was pointed in the RIGHT direction?

This game needs some more play before I make my final evaluation.  I really want to like it, and it has its moments.  BUT, the randomness/luck factor is big and that can be discouraging if you are on the wrong side of the situation.  When I played humans the cards came up in my favor in the first round and I destroyed my wife.  But then when we reversed roles the cards came up in my favor again and the "revenge" she thought she would get just didn't happen.

Perfect relaxation game after a hard days work. Not pure luck, but you need some of it. Also quite tactical play. Plays fast, easy, on the couch or anywhere. Cute artwork. 

Update: Did I say relaxation?!? After players get more experienced the luck factor reduces and this game can be a serious brain burner! Very recommended game. Not a 10, because I feel the animals most of the time don't have a chance. But even as animal player there's some strange attraction that brings me back to the game to find new strategies.

The balance of the game greatly depends on the position of the bears and the direction of the guns. A bad position can be frustrating rather than a challenge to get out of. Would rather play several other Kosmos two-player games over this.

An interesting blend of chess and rock-paper-scissors (for lack of a better description) where both players can control, move and capture any of the revealed pieces on the board.

Whimsical tile game with a light hunting theme and "forest exploration." The pieces are assymetrical and initially hidden, which leads to humor and variety, as well as a tolerable amount of game imbalance. Yes it's random, but it's also pretty fun, and there's strategy too. Chess-like tactics occasionally show up.

I found this game wildly unbalanced. There are a lot of hunters who can move quickly around the board. The only hope the animals have of removing them is by eating them with a slow (1 space move per turn) bear. I doubt a clever hunter player could be beaten.
This game doesn't offer enough scope to have any interest for me and I think rating it a 4 is being generous.

RATING: 6
Pretty good little abstract disguised in a great theme.  There's a fair bit of luck in turning over the tiles, but that also makes it very replayable.  It's also cool that you have to play both sides in a game.  While the luck can make some situations very frustrating, it's enjoyable enough for a quick two-player game.  Played online at Yucata.de.

Love the artwork of the Kosmos edition, but can't really say that the game impressed me all that much.  It has a little bit of a chess feel, but the revealing of the pieces is a bit too random to generate interesting decisions.  It's not bad for lighter fare, but too confrontational to play with my wife again.

Most plays on BSW. At first, it seems largely luck-driven. But there are some very skilled players out there -- there's definitely more to it than random chance. Unfortunately, it's just not much fun playing against those people!

Board is filled with face down tiles: hunters, lumberjacks, trees, birds, foxes, bears. It's humans vs. foxes/bears. On your turn, you either flip a tile or move it according to its own rules. If all tiles are face up, play out 5 more complete rounds, during which you may move your pieces off the board. Score for what you've killed or escaped (10 for people/bear, 2 for birds). Then, switch roles and play again.

RATING: 7
A fun theme and colorful board add personality to an abstract game.  I can see where, despite the random setup, there is some skill and further playing would uncover even greater depth.  Still, I wonder if it would grow stale for two experienced players with a few games under their belt, with the moves being somewhat obvious.  Who knows, I may appreciate it more after a few playings. Update:  I did appreciate it more and bumped up my rating a point.  Might be a good one to play with my wife.

This one did grow on me... At first it seems like a mostly luck based game but with patience it gets a chess similar quality, more straight forward though. Indeed, a grower. Unfortunately, some games can get ruined by too much luck. The set up can be very tedious, too, I play it online exclusively and don't have to deal with that though.

Ok game, interesting in that the two sides are unequal. The random flip of the tiles can be vexing, but later when some room is free-ed up there is some interesting choices. So far the human player has won, but my sample size is too small to make any conclusions.

A játék hangulata nagyon jó. A nagyon magas szerencsefaktor ellenére élvezetes a játék, és a vadászat élményét is nagyon jól hozza. Kicsit van benne torpedó érzés, de az ütési mechanizmus miatt egy kis sakk feeling is.

Minden klubon nagy siker még felnőttek között is, pedig - mint mondtam - nagyon nagy a szerencse szerepe.

Tile laying game in which you are trying to outfox your opponent.

Tally Ho! is a very clever, unique game in so many respects.  The only thing preventing it from a hearty endorsement is the fact that not every game is going to shine.

There is no way to mitigate the luck or offset the slant of the initial tile set up.  If you play it enough,  you will uncover the pearls in the oyster - and for those times,  for me at least,  the wait may be worth it.

Just realize,  that in between those times, you are going to be running a cross-town marathon on a treadmill.

One of my favorite 2 player games.  It's a tad like chess yet much lighter and fun, and each side has slightly different pieces, which is why you play the Bears and Foxes once and the Hunters and Lumberjacks once and combine the score.  Will no longer play with people who get analysis paralysis.

Interesting but simplistic gameplay. I don't necessarily like the idea of hunting or killing animals or humans for that matter, but the game is straight forward. Flip tile, move tile to eat creatures. Very much so luck based. Nothing else to it. No strategies or tactics needed for this games since the moves seem quite in your face.

05/2013
Continuing with my Kosmos two-player collection, Tally Ho is a pretty old asymmetric game from Rudi Hoffman. It is quite a simple game but luck-driven. Some clever game play can certainly net you a few extra kills but overall, luck still reigns when tiles are flipped over. Decent distraction from other games.

I found the randomness of this game to overshadow any amount of strategy in most instances. It's an interesting filler, but it has too many movement rules and scoring rules to make it worth playing.

RATING: 5
Since the orientation of the hunter matters greatly, not to mention the woodsman can only score points on trees, I feel the game is skewed with an advantage for the blue player (controlling bears and foxes).  Randomness guarantees decent replayability, but it is also a source of frustration if the setup greatly favors one side over the other.  There are some interesting tactical decisions, but overall a very shallow filler.  As far as 2-player games go, I don't feel the need to play this again as I've seen all that is it has to offer.

151117 I think that games with lots of special power cards just don't typically work for me and that's my primary memory of this game.  But it has a good rep, so I'll need to try it again sometime.

Basic pick up and deliver game for 2-players. In general, you roll and move, modified by technologies that cost points to play. That adds a touch of interesting card play (but only a touch). It feels very monotonous and uninteresting, but good enough for a nearly mindless 2-player filler.

A quite enjoyable pick-up-and-deliver game.  The action cards take a little getting used to, but there were several "that's clever!" moments during play.

Since it's not coming to the US, I recommend grabbing an imported copy and Artscow-ing the cards.

RATING: 7
A very nice, quick two-player game.  Not a ton to it, but it plays quick enough that the lack of substance/depth didn't annoy me.  I would play this one occasionally, when I'm looking for something light-to-medium and on the quicker side (~30 min.).

RATING: 6
First game seemed too repetitive.  Too mean/random for my wife with the "Switch Cargo" cards, but remove those and it's not half bad.  A little repetitive, and luckish, perhaps, but there's quite a bit of fun here, too.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
An amazingly fun game for 2. The similarity of the card deck made this game a very tight race till the end. The constant exchange and changes in environment/goods made each decision a calculated move, much like a chess game. 

Interaction between players are reasonably good but not too overwhelming. The way goods 'fade' away is an interesting mechanic. 

Overall a good pick up and deliver game. Done in an hours time.

RATING: 6
Pick up and deliver with some clever touches to represent diminishing supplies and the pull of gravity.  There's some quite interesting decision making here, generally based around the cards you hold.  

Those same cards do hold the potential to ruin your game. In my first game I had valuable cargoes stolen three times by the on-board transmitter card before I'd even managed to draw one - game over. 

Production quality is as you'd expect from Kosmos, the artwork is nothing special, although functional.

Fairly simple goods delivery game.  Somewhat interesting, but I'm not sure it is particularly deep, and may well be too luck driven, both in terms of getting good die rolls on movement and drawing the right technology cards (specifically extra containers) early in the game.

RATING: 8
A great two player game which beautifully utilizes the pick up and deliver mechanism.  The components all look great and I especially dig the theme and art around it, but the score track can get a bit fiddly at times with the miniature ships feeling clunky to move about.  Nevertheless, I also appreciate how the insert allows sleeved cards to easily fit in it.  The rules are easy enough to understand and the gameplay, while simple in weight, allows for a large variety in choices of strategy and tactics.  Very fun and plays around 45 minutes.

RATING: 8
The smallest tightest pick up and deliver game. This games flies so far under the radar that the only reason we had heard of it was through Eric Summerer's Top 100 games of all time on the Dice Tower Network. It's a Kosmos 2-player game with such easy play you can be playing it straight out of the box in 5 minutes. We got this in a trade with several other games and weren't holding out much hope really but since Eric gave it such high marks we thought there was nothing to lose. But we won with this little game.

Cool little game. Basically it's a very simple pick-up-and-deliver game with spaceships theme. Only 2p but it has the interaction and the tension that sometimes lacks the 2p games. The fact that the goods progressively are removed from the game brings an aliveness to the gameplay. The intervention cards add interest to the game, and the fact you can sometimes block your opponents cards is also a nice touch. Recomended.

Possibly my favorite Kosmos two player game. Its simplistic in nature, has a card playing feel that somewhat reminds me of my M:tG days, and has a fun space theme. I like pick up and deliver as a rule and this implements the mechanic quite nicely.

RATING: 7
Hits its target, which is a much shorter Merchant of Venus. It's random, but the randomness is influenced by your player choices and the rule-breaking player powers. There's lots of interesting stuff going on in the game from using VP as currency, the ability to block certain cards, and the way in which goods are distributed between the planets.

A very enjoyable little pickup-and-deliver game in space.  It has some great thematic touches like compensation for the sun's gravitational pull, and different hyper drives, etc. which really make the theme come alive in the game.  The components are excellent, except for the scoring track and the score markers.  They just don't fit right on the track and it can get quite confusing what number you are actually on.

The art is great, and also brings out the theme, and I like how you can focus on a number of different strategies.  There is a slight aspect of take-that in the game, but there is a way of protecting yourself from those attacks.  Other than the score track, my only complaint is that the game is strictly for 2 players.  I rarely get the opportunity to play 2-player games, so this makes it a game that will probably never have a place in my collection.  But if someone offers it in the future, I doubt I would turn down a game.

A great two-player game that my wife and I both love the theme and race mechanics to pick up deliver those goods and get the most money.  We can play a game in about 30 minutes.  Give this one a try if you like sci-fi and are looking for a shorter head-to-head battle.

Really like this - might even go up to 10, depends how it stands up to repeated plays.

Lots to like here - planet system gives a boardgame feel, with going inwards easier than outwards, pickup/deliver works elegantly.

My only downsides are the graphic design, not being a german speaker obviously hurts (although paste ups available here are great), but they could have colour coded the cards and put  some meaningful icons on them to help. Play it a few times and you learn the cards, so it's not a major issue.

As a filler length it's great - as there is more of a game here than many fillers.

I remember the paperback books featuring perry Rhodan back in the 60's (although I was only a couple of years old at the time).  I only ever read a couple, but really can't remember much outside of the main character.

While the game may not have a great deal to do with the original adventure stories...it does fit the bill as an outstanding two-player game.  The pick-up and deliver race mechanic has been done before, but this version of the idea works extremely well.  The game is well balanced for both players with just the right amount of luck involved.  
I own 11 of the Kosmos 2-player series and have only come across one (LOTR-The Duel) that did not come up to expectations.  Congratulations on an outstanding series of games.

(3 plays) This game is a stripped down version of "Merchant of Venus" with cards which plays in about 30 to 40 minutes. The components are nicely done, although they are not exactly my taste, and the "Perry Rhodan" theme is nothing I'm really fond of. The game is highly luck-dependent and there are some really strong card combos which allow for a runaway victory.Apart from the significantly shorter playing time there is nothing this game does better than its elder brother. So I'd always prefer a two player game of the real MoV over this rather dumbed down easy teenage version.

Nicely designed 2-player only game.  Nice thematic elements with movement costs differing depending on which way one is traveling through the system.  Card play creates enough variability between games.  The double-sided resource cards are a neat mechanic for a game "time" element as well as restocking of resources on the worlds.  Recommended Fully.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This game didn't quite work. Something about the movement, and the fact that the goods cards disappear over the game, leaving the endgame to a limp over the finish line. After mid-game it's not advantageous to buy upgrades so they tend to clog your hand turn after turn. A shame because the bits are nice as is the artwork. I'm glad I got to play this so I could cross it off my wishlist.

It's not a bad game, just an inelegant one that seems a bit out of joint as you play it.  There are far better pickup and deliver games out there, though admittedly the list of good ones for 2 players is fairly short.  I guess if you really MUST have a 2-pl pickup and deliver game, and like the space theme, it's passable.  Just not something I'd be willing to spend my own money on.

Fun space-themed pick-up-and-deliver filler. I don't know anything about the Perry Rhodan universe, but it doesn't really matter for this game. The double-sided cards were cleverly designed: you discard duplicates after selling a good, thus preventing players from continually taking the same cards back and forth between the same two planets.

I also like that you have to spend your VPs to upgrade your ship; in doing so you risk falling behind in points, but increase your chances of pulling ahead later for a victory. Neat little game.

I like pick up and deliver games quite a bit, and this is a pretty good, light two-player entry in the genre.  Card play adds quite a bit of unpredictability to the game, and can really ruin your plans sometimes.  I think the difference between winning and losing will usually come down to the cards, and whether you have the right ones in your hand at the right time, but the whole game is still pretty fun.

In this two-player game, each player has an identical deck of cards and starting set up.  Players move goods from world to world to score victory points.  The trick is, a hold can store only one type of good and can be loaded only a single time.  Points can be spent to build improvements to aid in this.  There are also action cards that can help.  Some of these allow interfering with your opponent.  The goods are cards.  As goods are delivered, the cards are flipped.  If two or more have the same new destination world, they are removed from the game.  Goods are frustratingly scarce near the end of the game.

RATING: 7.6
For years I've been wanting to try this 2-player game on the recommendation from some of my geekbuddies, and I finally acquired a copy in a BGG auction.  While on the surface it seems like a simple pick up and deliver game, there are a lot of crucial decisions to make, particularly with your hand of cards.  Flying away from the sun takes more energy.  Is it worth investing in a jump drive to the outer reaches of the galaxy?  Or should you spent precious money on another cargo hold so you can move more at once?  Perhaps you'll want to take some passengers along for the ride and score some extra cash.

What I think I liked about this game the most is that it doesn't fall into the frequent tug-of-war style that is so common in 2 player games.  Instead you both start with the same set of cards and just need to decide how best to use them and make the most of what the die roll gives you for fuel.

Curious, interesting, well worth exploring with repeated plays.  And great-looking components, to boot!

Players are space merchants, flying around the solar system trying to turn a profit.  Simple two player game - players on their turn can take two "planet" actions (load, unload, improve technology), combined with one flight action (roll a die for energy and fly somewhere else).  You're trying to pick up goods and ship them to another planet for profit.  Technology upgrades eat into that profit, but give you more power on your turn.  Intervention cards give you instant actions, but can be blocked by your opponent.  Nice little two player game - kind of like a sci-fi Jambo, inspired by the old Merchants of Venus game.  Worth a look.

Very enjoyable light pick up and deliver game. Interesting mechanisms (gravity, increasing scarcity of goods) and difficult decisions. Bit too random. Has a few Fluxxish strategy disrupting direct screwage options I hate (swap cargos, swap positions). I've thought about removing those but I haven't tried yet.

There are a couple neat ideas in this game.  One of the best is that movement away from the sun is more difficult than towards the sun - may not be realistic but it does make for an interesting game mechanism.  This ended up being a bit lighter than I would have liked though. Overall the game is clever and pleasant, and I love the theme, but in the end it left my wife and myself with a "meh" aftertaste.  I think that for me, this game is a victim of me having other games I'd rather play when in this kind of mood - both Jambo and Starship Catan come to mind.

UPDATE: OK, about a week after panning the game above, I find my self unexpectedly craving a game of this.  This game does have a pleasant rhythm to it, and maybe that's what is drawing me back to it.  I don't know if my wife will want to play this any more, though.  The cards that do things like swap your ship locations or swap your cargo are not enjoyed by her.

UPDATE Feb 2017: I like this game better than meh after all, but my wife is still just meh on it. That probably destins it to the trade pile.

Trade notes; This is the german edition, though an english print out is provided. Also the standees for the player markers are missing so you have to use the player markers lying down.
--------------------------------
6 planets in a row, trade cards with destinations in sets beneath them. Pick up the cards and move them to their destinations. Has a deck of upgrade techs and take that style cards to add an extra layer of strategy. Its reminiscent of Merchants of Venus and euro games of the 90s. I enjoyed this quite a bit though some games will get blown out by a lucky opening card draw or big delivery.

The description of a stripped down version of Mechants of Venus for two players is apt.  I can say that I do prefer this game to MoV.  That said I just don't feel like this game can compete with all of the other great card games out there.  I feel that the various upgrades you can get for your ship aren't very well balanced which was the final nail in the coffin for me.

A light, thematic pickup-and-deliver game. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
[2 plays] This knocked my socks off.  I should say up front that the theme went right over my head, as I had to google to even find out who Perry Rhodan was.  On the plus side from that perspective, though, although there may have been a bunch of stuff that one familiar with the Rhodan oeuvre would have appreciated, I didn't really perceive it beyond the title.  It wasn't like the experience of playing, say, Ankh-Morpork, where the theme is constantly in your face even if you don't know what any of it is.

The reason I was keen to try this (aside from the fact that I'll try anything in the Kosmos 2p line) is that people had compared it to Merchant of Venus, which I'm somewhat obsessed with.  And they were not wrong.  This is a much smaller, shorter, simpler game, but it DOES have an MoV flavor to it.  Like MoV, it's essentially pickup-and-deliver in space, and it also is fraught with nifty gadgets. 

If you try to max out on arming yourself with helpful gadgets and special powers, though, by the time you do the game will be over.  I think this is a game where you have to pick your strategic course and not try to do everything and have everything.  Since money is victory points (as in MoV), you also have to really ask yourself whether any advantage you pay for is going to pay back. 

This game was terrific fun for 2 people in space, and I am anxious to get hold of a copy and play it a bunch more.

Only two plays so far, but Perry Rhodan seems an interesting and engaging game that offers a fair bit of thought and planning.

Where it seems to fall down somewhat is in the randomness of the technology and intervention card draws. This creates two issues: first, good draws at the beginning of the game can give that player a disporportionately strong start; and second, the cards seem to create an element of determinism and to drive the choices that come after.

Whether these concerns hold up with repeat plays remains to be seen, but my intial impressions are pretty favorable.

Very enjoyable game, nice to find a 2p game that's not a duel. It felt more like a race but it was fluctuating a lot and on reflection, better timing and use of my cards would have helped. As it was, I only lost by a single point right at the finish. Playing with the German deck was a little difficult, but as we played, it became easier. I would be happy to play this again, and I suggest fans of the Kosmos series should not be put off by the text.

RATING: 8.1
An very quick-paced two-player game game with elegant, stream-lined rules.  Every game feels like a different experience because of the distribution of the goods on the planets and the upgrades and interventions that are/become available during gameplay.  It's loaded with decisions:  Do I spend an intervention to block an opponent's intervention or save it?  Do I upgrade or race for the finish?  Do I use install this upgrade now or do I wait to get a second to install both and thus pay a relatively lower price?  Etc...  I like this game just a tad more than Starship Catan.  I strongly recommend it as a big filler or if you have a gamer husband/wife.

After more than a dozen plays, I can confidently recommend that you play it WITHOUT the Hyperjump Outward Card.  It is fine if both players get it or neither player gets it, but if only one has it (at or from near the start), the other player is almost always doomed.  I won't go so far as to say the card is broken, but I will say that I and the people I have played with enjoy the game much more without it.

I started laughing when I saw the game laid out. It reminds me so much of a design I was working on years ago. Anyways, the game itself is a cool little game. The actual on-the-table mechanics are brilliant, but the players' decks are full of action/power cards that make the game swingy. Still, quite good. I could see my rating going up to an 8. Also, I feel like this is a return to the spirit of the Kosmos 2 player line that long ago lost its shine, so that's cool too.

The game was too complicated to teach to a non-gamer, but like the other pickup-and-deliver game I've tried, Eurorails, didn't have enough going on to hold my attention. It seemed too difficult to move for there to be much choice about your actions each turn, and bad rolls were a significant annoyance. The upgrades didn't affect enough to form a strategic layer; the game is mostly turn-by-turn tactics.

The solitaire rules are pretty good though: it's human versus robot match where the robot's cold predictable efficiency is matched against your creativity and cunning.

Perry Rhodan is a pretty light, unoffensive pick-up-and-deliver game for two. Players move their spaceships through the solar system, making money by trading with the planet dwellers. Money is necessary to win the game but can also be used to buy improvements for your spaceship, e.g. so that you can travel faster or carry more goods.

As mentioned the game is rather light but the ship upgrades and action cards as well as the layout of the solar system where travelling towards the sun is cheaper than fighting its gravitational pull allow for a decent amount of tactical play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Outstanding 2 player pick up and deliver game.  I wasn't expecting it to rely so heavily on cards, but that is where the tactical possibilities shine.  It plays relatively quick, the scores are tight, and the end game is tense.  I can see this quickly becoming a favorite.  Kudos to Z-Man for taking a risk a finally putting this out in English.

A fine two-player game with simple rules but a bit too complicated cards. It plays quickly and is neatly designed. Maybe if it wasn't for the theme (almost unknown outside Germany) it would be better recognized and rated. Good to play from time to time. Just another solid Kosmos-series game.

Surprisingly, the randomness in this game comes NOT from the die but from the cards. In many cases they determine the winner.

Works very nicely.  Theme is good, I can see where the references to Merchant of Venus come from.

I thnk we would of heard more about this if Race for the Galaxy had not been such a raging success at the same time in the well-themed SF 2p game niche.  Easy to play with the crib sheets here - no need for cumbersome pasting up

Who knew a game in the Kosmos 2-player line could be so rich? Get past the ugly typography (bright yellow Comic Sans with black outline!) and get over your snobbish dislike of roll-and-move. This is a pickup and deliver game after all. Moving between planets is fun! Dropping of not just cargo, also added passengers, is a neat twist. Easy enough rules and plenty of cards to let you break them.

This may be my favorite Kosmos 2-player game. Each player has the same exact deck of cards, but when cards come up and how you roll the die affects what strategies you will need to use.

Perry Rhondan: The Cosmic League is a relatively simple pick-up-and-deliver game that nicely balances luck with skill. Not too easy and not too difficult, this game would probably work well as a more difficult game for my mythical grandchildren, as a gateway game for non-gamers, and as a light-weight game for days when brains are too tired for something heavier. 

The Z-Man 2010 edition has sturdy and colorful components, but my husband had a hard time remembering actions until I made a player's aid for him to track available and expended actions. It might also be helpful to have a mat for the planets (indicating orbits and energy units for inbound and outbound flights).

Decent enough 2 player game.  I have it and will keep it because I like my little collection of 2 player Kosmos games, but I don't think I would necessarily have to have it if I didn't already own it.

I watched a full game and got all the rules.  I had several interesting twists, but left me not really wanting to play it.  It was less an economic trading game than a move efficiency game with some card play - cool that you could cancel your opponent's card action by sacrificing an identical one.  The space theme veneer is pretty thin with lots of impossible (from a sci-fi perspective) things happening.

I would have preferred more adventure in a game set in the universe of Perry Rhodan, but it is still a very nice effort.

RATING: 8
Wow--it really IS Merchant of Venus light!  And it's brilliantly done.  I love how the cargo works--when delivered, it flips over to the other side, but doubles are discarded, so that the total amount of loot in the solar system decreases over time.  And you can still build up your ship, so each player will eventually have slightly different capabilities (although, caveat here, the extra storage is maybe a little too strong), which certainly adds flavor.  The special ability cards also allow you to do different things as you travel around the system and even interact with the other players.  Love it.  Looking forward to the reprint.

Drawback? As published, it seems to be a two-player game. Boo.  I don't see any good reason it couldn't play at least four, maybe five--in fact, we played with an official three player variant when we played. (1 play)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A very simple pickup-and-deliver game. Some may view this as Merchant of Venus light.

One of the reasons I enjoy this so much is because of how the mechanics are all so thematic. This is a space themed game where two competing spaceships (that look totally different from each other; one's a Death Star looking thing, the other looks like something pulled from Buck Rogers) are picking up goods on five different planets. Once a good is sealed, you can't open it until you get to your destination planet. Also along the way you can decide to drop off passengers who booked a ride with you (these come up through random draws). But all of this is done carefully. Because you only get ONE roll of a die each turn to determine how far your ship can fly. And if your flying away from the sun...it takes a lot longer than if you're flying towards it.

This is a great little filler game for two people, and only takes about 30 minutes to play.

I was poking around BGG while putting the finishing touches on a coolstuffinc order, and I stumbled across a review with a title referring to Perry Rhodan as a shorter, 2-player Merchant of Venus. I didn't even have to click on the review. It went right into the cart.

--Update Dec 8, 2014--
The randomness can be a bit difficult to mitigate. That's not really an issue unless the game comes down to the wire and the win goes to whomever has the right special action card or something. Still a pretty fun game, but occasionally the end of the game feels really shallow.

Solid 8 right out of the gate! Not sure why I originally bought this, but I sure am glad I did! 

As I'm not familiar with the original Perry Rhodan books, the space trucking theme is just fine with me. In fact, that's one of the main selling points for me. The options presented by the cards throughout the game are great, albeit not always available when you want/need them, hence a bit of luck thrown in the pot.

I like how our games so far have been really close. It seems as if the game is well-balanced, and there are always opportunities to catch up with the leader. The gameplay is pretty straightforward, with just a small learning curve to understand how to use the cards for maximum effect. 

Great addition to the KOSMOS 2-player series. 

Update: Already bumping this up a notch after 8 plays. My wife and I are loving it.

RATING: 5
I don't typically use the word neat to describe things but it seems apropo for Perry Rhodan. There is a nice little deck building and hand management system happening here along with the core pick-up and deliver mechanic. I think it will be a good game for newbies, younger gamers, and light gaming nights with my wife. Preliminary rating 6.

WIFE RATING - 5

UPDATE: 6.29.11 

Rating drops from 6 to 5.

3 plays in and I have to say Perry really isn't my thing. There isn't anything particularly wrong with the game but there is very little interaction here and solitaire types don't do it for me.

Traded for Agricola X and Ferry decks (a 2011 Christmas gift for David).

[b]Current Comment:[/b] Perry Rhodan is a rare pleasure for me, because it's a game that seems to "meet its responsibilities" perfectly. I'm about 15 plays in, and growing quite fond of it. The kick-off is unusually good: one player goes first (a clear advantage), but the other player chooses their starting position with full knowledge of his opening hands and the initial goods distribution (also a clear advantage). What this amounts to is that one player is first off the starting line but the other player sticks their foot out to trip them. It's quite funny, actually, and makes for good game balance. So the game begins with some mild shenanigans, and then proceeds with each player configuring their long-term technology setup. Different combinations of 1-4 tech cards (more commonly 2-3) create distinct playstyles, and from there its up to the player to effectively execute that style and best leverage the technology. The game itself is a light but sufficiently engrossing logistics game, in which you plan your short-term deliveries, look ahead to maintain your momentum and disrupt your opponents', and pace yourself as you fly from planet to planet (managing the risk of losing actions if you cannot reach your destination in a single flight). Movement is determined by a die roll, but the game is setup so that the only truly "bad" roll is a 2 (d6), and sure enough, one of the techs available adds a +1 modifier to the roll, eliminated the one truly unlucky result. This benefit is nicely in tune with the number of total rolls made over the course of the game, which brings me to my last point about Perry Rhodan: polish. The game has in spades. The designer is a decades-long fan of Merchant of Venus, and Perry Rhodan is clearly a labor of love and a wonderful homage to Avalon Hill's classic game (which is also a favorite of mine). 

Is Perry Rhodan mind-blowing? No. But it is a [i]fully realized[/i] game design, by which I mean it has no clear downsides or pitfalls. And that's why I'm so fond of it. It functions exactly as it ought to, engages me, and makes for a fun 30-40 minutes. A 9 rating might be just a tad generous, but I'm still having a blast with this one and it's rare to come across a game (even a great one) that doesn't seem like a mixed bag. Highly recommended. 

[b]Old Comment[/b]In the era of card games and dice games, who knew that a 2-player, 30 minute take on Merchant of Venus was available only in German?

Perry Rhodan gives players a spaceship with a cargo hold, several planets on which to buy and sell goods, and a small deck of cards with upgrades and special actions. You need money to win, but you also spend it on upgrades, which forces you to commit to a couple of them early and then run that strategy against your opponent. Some cards are important to hold for defensive play, because they allow you to cancel the matching card in your opponent's deck. You wouldn't expect much route-planning out of this game (after all, there are just six planets laid out in a single row), but the sun's gravity field makes you consider the possibilities before reversing direction. Quite a bit of game emerges in just 30 minutes, and the cards are easy to get the hang of despite the German text. Worth picking up.

Along with Odin's Ravens, this is the best of the Kosmos 2P line.

Theres a lot to like here - this rating will increase it if withstands repeated plays.

English paste ups are fine, but they could have done some more design work with colour co-ordination to make the different types (tech & actions) more distinct.

All small things though - an excellent game.

Ordered from amazon.de

Perry Rhodan: Die Kosmische Hanse is what happens if Merchant of Venus is transformed into a Kosmos two-player smallbox game lasting 30 minutes. As reduced a pickup-and-delivery game as [gameid=111417] but a bit more game to it, only limited to two. The amount of randomness fits the length of the Cosmic League.

RATING: 7.8

Number of players: 2

Components: (7)
I was impressed with the components to this game, actually. Even though they're all so simple, I wasn't expecting the planets to come out looking so nice. The ships are cardboard and not plastic, but that's okay by me. The cards aren't of the highest quality that you'll find anywhere, but they're decent enough that I don't worry about destorying them with normal play.
  
Rules: (10)
The rules are simple and clearly written. 

Setup: (10)
Set up is laying out the planets and placing a set of cards below them.

Area required to play: (8)
This game takes up a surprising amount of space compared to the tiny footprint of the box. It still takes up a lot less than many board games that aren't nearly as good as it is, though.
 
Fun: (8)
This is a great game that Jessica and I both enjoy. It is a light game/filler game, but that isn't a mark against it. It's the appitizer to a night of great gaming.

Theme Integration / Mechanics: (7)
You're piloting around this galaxy collecting resources from one planet and delivering them to another. It's fun and it works. I especially like how it takes more fuel to move away from the sun than it does towards it. Gravity is bad for you! One thing I don't understand is why you're never really sure how much fuel you have. That is determined by rolling a die. It works for the game, the mechanic is really wonderful. As for the theme? It doesn't really fit, but it's works for the mechanic so well that it isn't a big deal.

Replay Value: (8)
I'm willing to play whenever you are.

Storage: (10)
And this! Listen, this box doesn't waste space. It DOES have a place for everything, however. It has a place for everything and no big empty gaps. The box is tiny and allows plenty of room on the shelf. I love it.

Accessibility: (10)
This game is super easy to teach. As a matter of fact, I think I'm going to go see if my six year old neice is interested in learning it.

RATING: 6
Not being familiar with the Perry Rhodan universe, the theme and artwork seem a little hokey to me.  The game is fairly simple, though somewhat difficult to memorize the functions of the German-language cards.  It seems important to time things right and balance your greed.  The "switch container" card killed me, giving a huge advantage to my opponent at a critical time.  It also seems like the goods may dry up too quickly.  Near the end of the game almost everything was gone.

Quick trading game, perhaps with some control issues: tech strategy is largely dictated by early card draws, and clearly some big swings can be caused by failure to pull the appropriate counters. Still, there's a challenge to make the best of what you get, and games don't drag out. The movement rules don't reflect real physics, some of the card effects have no apparent thematic justification, and the Perry Rhodan connection seems vague at best.

RATING: 6
After a couple plays, I would have just a couple of observations. The scoring track is horrendous as it is too easy to knock a scoring marker off and its a very crowded scoring track on the sun, particularly for the ship marker - ugh!  Secondly, I'm not sure if the different technology cards really are nearly as beneficial as another.  I think there are a few I would totally skip altogether in future plays or perhaps I would consider only in combination.  The game is a fun, pick up and deliver game that I would play again despite these couple potential issues.  Like most Kosmos two player games, the game is fairly light and easy to pick up and play.  I also appreciate the slowing of the spaceship movement rate going against the sun (yeah, that gravity thing sucks when you are moving to the outer rim!).  The card allowing you to swap cargo loads with your opponent can really be a game killer as it can pretty much end the game in the early going and people are just playing out the string.

A pick-up and deliver game with a fairly straightforward approach, except for a few interesting things: flying away from the sun is harder than flying towards it, goods eventually disappear, and it's pretty damn MEAN. If you don't know what cards are available and what can be done to you, you won't be expecting some of the jerk moves that can be made. This definitely raises it up a notch!

RATING: 5
I've only played one dummy game and one real game so not rating yet, but its not clicking with me like i hoped.  I can't place it, but it seems the whole is less than the sum of its parts.  I like how thematic its able to be with just some cardboard and cards.  I like the movement mechanic, I like the ship upgrading mechanic, I like the way the goods are layed out on the planets and I like moving them from planet to planet.  I don't know, maybe it feels like the choice of what to do each turn is too simple, maybe its because i want the price of goods to fluctuate somehow, maybe the card draw and dice rolling are too much randomness.  The choices just don't seem as agonizing as Lost Cities or Jaipur, i'm not sure, i'll need to play more.
The Intervention cards should be more different looking from the tech cards.  They should have more obviously different borders, like the difference between Dominion action and treasure cards.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
We ended up liking it quite a bit!  The route connection aspect of the game is literally linear, but the directionality of gravity gives it an interesting twist.  The supply of goods is randomly distributed but the demands are fixed to the planets, which saves time looking up where things need to go.  The special ability cards are what gives the game some extra spice, although I'm not sure if some cards aren't overpowered.  Still, it gives the game a little bit of variety and a little bit of that feeling of building up your ship in different areas.  The game is also very quick so it doesn't overstay it's welcome, using an interesting timing mechanism by removing some of the goods cards, although the quickness does make the narrative arc a little weird.  You start out with no money and slowly build up your funds and invest in your ship.  In the middle of the game, you can start planning large deliveries.  However, as the goods cards start disappearing, the last quarter of the game results in deliveries of just one or two goods.  The end of the game feels like it starts winding down rather than growing towards a climax.  Still, the game is short enough that it's not a big problem.

We definitely enjoyed this more than [thing=168][/thing], so maybe we do like pick-up and deliver games.  Oddly enough, [thing=30367][/thing] actually gave us somewhat of a feeling of [thing=12002][/thing] where you're trying to pick up goods and fulfill orders, using special cards to try and manipulate your abilities.  The best part is that it's a quick enough game that we can fit it in while the little guy is taking a nap.

It's a game of hand management coupled with pick up and deliver. While the game has some randomness, it's no more so than my other fav Kosmos 2p Jambo. It actually has exactly the same level of strategy, tactics and luck as Jambo, so if you're a fan I couldn't recommend this one more. 

One thing: Either the sun should be smaller or the player tokens should have been some sort of plastic bit or cube, not a ship shaped chit.

RATING: 7
Worthy of taking the time to apply English paste-ups to all of the cards.  'Merchant of Venus Light for two' is a pretty fair descriptor, but I'd still rather play Merchant of Venus with two.  Advantage is quicker set up and less overall fiddliness.  Disadvantage is loss of kitschy character that comes along with the fiddliness.  This is more of the weight of other Kosmos 2-player games, than an old AH title.

RATING: 6
Game in a Nutshell:  Players race to make a certain amount of money by picking up groups of cards from one planet and delivering them to another. Splash in some cards that add bonuses for variety.

Played as:  2 player

Pros:  Fills a niche as a quick pick up and deliver game. Has a better presentation than many of the more popular Kosmos 2-player games. In theory, having ship upgrades is a nice idea.

Cons:  It can be argued this is just a mish-mash of mechanics that comes out being nothing more then functional.  I‚Äôm not sure the roll and move aspect was the best choice here... while it, thankfully, hasn‚Äôt become a point of frustration so far, it still comes across as a little hokey. The theme, which is overly built up in the rulebook‚Äôs introduction, unfortunately doesn‚Äôt shine through the mechanics.  The allowable "one flight, two actions" every turn winds up feeling too restrictive with little room for creative maneuverability from one turn to the next. Needs to come with a simple, playing card sized, player aid to ease in new players.

Other:  Reminds me a lot of Jambo which I didn‚Äôt see coming.  They‚Äôre both a race to make a set amount of money except in one you‚Äôre managing goods on a stand to later sell and the other managing goods on a ship to later deliver.  Really, it‚Äôs the same game done in a slightly different way.  Mixed in both are a bunch of variable advantage cards that can end with you "sleeping on the couch" if you‚Äôre not careful.  I‚Äôll have to play both more to decide which one I like better or if over time they differentiate themselves from one another.  One thing that would be nice is if I could play with someone who doesn‚Äôt mind some screwage.

Best Use:  Pick-up and Deliver fans looking for a quick and functional filler for two need look no farther.

RATING: 7
Some interesting mechanics:  double sided cards, asymmetrical movement, various monkey wrenches.  You can "invest" in technologies, but individually none is very helpful.  The limit to two planetary actions is stringent, and it is hard to improve the turnover rate in your hand.  I don't see how to set up an economic engine.  Which leads me to believe the game is mostly luck based.  I hope I am wrong.

Really nifty 2-player pick up and deliver game. Enough "screw you" cards to be interactive, but not so many as to make planning and decisions irrelevant. The punch your neighbor cards can also be countered by discarding the same card you're being attacked with. Also, you have to spend VP if you want ship upgrades which is pretty clever.

My wife and I really like this one so far.

RATING: 3
Initial Impression: Fun, quick little game probably worth at least a few plays. Nice amount of logistical planning with a dash of confrontational card play. It seemed overly simplistic and possibly repetitive at first, but some interesting card combos started to reveal themselves later on. Worth further exploration.

Update 1: Can't really plan around card combos. It really seems to come down to luck of the draw. Decisions aren't that hard. I feel done with this after three plays.

Update 2: Played a few more times with my girlfriend, because she liked it, but now she's done with it too. I can see this working pretty well for kids who are into Perry Rhodan or scifi, but as an adult/couples game, it's got a pretty short shelf life.

Much lighter than I was expecting. Roll, move, pick up, drop off. While you can build up your ship, you'll spend most of your time just trying to pick up sets of cargoes in what's really just a rummy game. I like it, but I wish it required more complicated planning.

I am a big fan of Merchant of Venus and one day told Mario Truant (my Erlk√É¬∂nig partner) that I wanted to design a "Tribut to Merchant of Venus" game.

My objective was to catch the "flavour" of "Merchant" (as we call it over here) consisting of two characteristics:

a) the dilemma: Should I invest further or run for the finish?
b) the question: Where is the optimal route?

Mario told me to do it with 110 cards and nothing else, no board, no money, no meeples - just cards.

Ups - that was quite a challenge.I did it (the biggest problem was how to represent the money which I solved by putting credits on the back of the cards) and the result was a freakish gamer's game called "Venus Connection" (see game entry).

Although science fiction games are in most cases rejected by german publishing companies I demonstrated the game to Kosmos and - unexpectedly - they accepted.

Venus Connection was something like a "minimalistic cover version" of Merchant but the Perry Rhodan variant is a card/board game in the typical tradition of the Kosmos two player games with nice components.

RATING: 6
The title was borrowed from the 16h Cycle of the Perry Rhodan saga, but it has NOTHING to do with it. In other words: The theme is pasted on. It is obvious that the Perry Rhodan license was acquired for pure marketing reasoning, not for the designers intention to create a Perry Rhodan game.

But it doesn't actually matter. The game can be played in 30-45 minutes and is a medium light, nice game experience. The artwork reflects current standards and is indeed thematically accurate (original artwork taken form Perry Rhodan novels). There is player interaction, but it's limited. Nasty destructive moves are possible, but direct interaction has little impact on the game dynamics. 

The game's main flaw is an anti-climatic end game. In my 3 first plays, it had been clear that the leading player couldn't be caught up again within the remaining last 5 turns or so. Effectively, we just had to formally play the game to the end. It also seems comparably random: Some technologies seam significantly more important than others: An early Orbital Station is very useful when combined with jump to the inner/outer rim; vice versa, the jump technologies are useless without the Orbital Station; I have twice purchased a second container, but I don't think it was a good investment.

All in all, I'm a bit sceptical if the game will provide enough to satisfy me on a longer term.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (6):[/COLOR]

[i]An okay 2p pick up and deliver game that got lost in the shuffle when looking for a quick, 2p game. I got this to play with my son because he loves Merchant of Venus, but the gameplay felt samey and the die rolls could be a killer (and even though MoV has dice, you feel like you have more time to overcome a few bad rolls which is not the case in Perry). The card play definitely added some variety to the game play, but not enough to draw us back in for repeated plays. We're still looking for the quick pick up and deliver experience that has a small footprint (We've played Great Heartland and we weren't fans).[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (7):[/COLOR]

[i]- Designed for 2 players.
- Pick up and deliver in under 30 minutes: When we don't have time for a game of Merchants of Venus we can pull this out.
- Theme/aesthetics: both my son and I enjoy the sci-fi/space artwork in the game.

I need to play it more to give it a solid rating, it could easily go up or down.[/i]

The designer intended this to be a shorter, lighter Merchant of Venus, and really hit it right on.  Flipping the goods tile is a brilliant alternative to the MoV "goods cup".  This really invokes the feel of pick-up-and-deliver in a space setting while upgrading your ship in order to better do so.  I really wish this were more than two-player, and really can think of no reason why this system cannot be generalized to more players.

Very good 2p game. Probably the best from the Kosmos 2p line that I've played. 

Pick up and deliver with a sci-fi theme and nice mechanics. I particularly like the planet movement (it's harder to move away from the sun due to gravity effects) and the use victory points to pay for ship upgrades. 

Games are relatively fast (30 to 45 minutes) and present some interesting decisions to the players. There is some luck, but in a game of this nature it seems completely reasonable.

Decent little pick and deliver game. I don't know anything about Perry Rhodan so I have no judgment about whether this game is a good reflection of the book or not. I particularly like how the goods cards function -- they are doubled sided with differing points and get eliminated as the game progresses, making it more challenging to accumulate points. I'm not sure how much replayability the game has but we had a good time playing it. Even D liked it.

Didn't like my inagural play.  I found the game to be too 'take that' heavy, and I got hosed too often without an ability to defend myself.

Finally got a chance to play this yesterday. We played without the intervention and technology cards to get used to the Pickup-and-Deliver mechanic. Unless you count Finca (and it's probably fair not to count it), this is the first PnD game we've played. Even without the cards, we both liked it quite a bit and we expect adding them back in will quickly propel this to a household favorite.

No rating as we haven't yet played with the full rules.

RATING: 8
Pick-up-and-deliver done properly, for once.

It addresses an issue almost all pick-up-and-deliver games have: Picking up goods is fun. Planning your route is fun. Delivering your goods is boring, especially if it takes several turns to do so. In this game, you will deliver any goods you have picked up on your last turn.

Yes, this game is riddled with luck, even more luck than a game of Cribbage. It's not that a roll of a die dictates how many spaces your ship may move. It's that you have no control when your technology cards will come up in play. Because technologies permanently improve your gaming situation, getting the good technologies early will almost guarantee you a win. Compare this with Cribbage: nothing persists (like a special power) from hand to hand -- except, of course, any points you have gained.

However, this game is not strategic fare, and does not pretend to be so; all this luck is totally acceptable to me.

I bought Perry Rhodan to fill a niche in my collection. I was looking for a light two player filler game and I didn't have many pick-up and deliver games. In the 20 to 30 minutes it takes to play you end up with a very satisfying experience. I enjoy the tech buying mechanic where the more tech cards you have the more expensive it is. You are always faced with a tough choice because if buy the tech you pay for it with victory points, maybe you'll be better off if you don't buy it.  You definitely only want to buy what you need. They may have had to expand to more planets but I think this could have worked with 3 players. There can be a case of run away leader if you pick up good cards and get some better tech cards early. I'm not familiar with the Perry Rhodan universe but it hasn't stopped me from loving this game.

RATING: 4
There is nothing good to say about Perry Rhodan. The artwork is okay, but in a uninspired retro style, the game play is as bland as can be and there are few, if any interesting decisions to make during play.

While the tech card concept is okay, the fact that you have zero control over what will come up in your deck (very often only drawing 1 card per turn) and how radically unbalanced cards can be depending on your/your opponent's situational needs, the entire experience feels random. 

example: my opponent played a card that would have swapped my cargo (value 8) for his cargo (value 2), which would have dramatically increased his already sizable lead. However, since I happened to have that card in my hand (a 1 in 8 chance that early in the game) I was able to block the action and thus dramatically delayed his development. (as he now had to deliver a single resource to a farther off planet) Essentially, that single card play dictated who won the game.

Kinda garbage

Also, after having played both versions of Merchant of Venus (classic and new), I have to say this does feel like a mini version of it. I'd say it even has more strategy and interaction, and less luck than MoV itself, but still the same amount of "adventure" (due to the cards). 
This is much more fun than the pick up and deliver from planet x to planet y that you see at first. The fun is mainly derived from action cards that change the rules (which I usually dislike, it reminds me too much of MTG) - allowing you to upgrade your ship with better engines or cargo holds, or just screwing with your opponent by e.g. swapping your crappy single card cargo with a juicy double or triple you really needed for a planet nearby. There's rules for playing this with three, which is very good, too, and someone even made a printable third ship standee and money track token. There's also a small print and play expansion - I think just cards that give you special secret missions for some bonus points.

It's been a while that I bought a 2-player game from Kosmos, but this one I found interesting enough to buy without trying. The sci-fi theme/art and [url=http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perry_Rhodan]Perry Rhodan[/url], the longest ongoing sci-fi series in the world, caught my eye.

The game has nice and practical components, although the sun Megagalax (a.k.a. victory points) track is somewhat confusing and fiddly. In principle it is a pick-up and deliver type of game, as you are flying from planet to planet getting money for the goods you deliver. Each planet only takes a specific type of good. In addition to that goods are getting depleted over time, so that the game ends either when someone has 70 Megagalxes or there are no cards left to deliver.

First I have to say, that I liked the game. I like the theme and the implementation of it. The technology cards, which help to give the game some flavour and theme work well and actually help quite a bit in optimizing your trade routes (buy a container as soon as, and if, possible!). The only thing, which falls short for me is interaction. In principle there are some cards, which let you change goods (not steal!) or change the position of the ships on the board. But apart from that you are more or less flying around the solar system doing your thing. It doesn't make the game a bad game, but if you are looking for some fights with space pirates, meteor showers and hot laser space action, you gotta turn elsewhere.

Still, good game, preliminary rating of 7.5.

Played once. Perry Rhodan is a pick-up-and-deliver game which is simpler than its complex appearance suggests. Players putter around planets loading and delivering goods, making a space buck or two until somebody hits 70 megagalax and is declared the winner.

Shaking up the routine affair are technological upgrades which typically grant useful permanent abilities. As these upgrades become pricier if you have already purchased other upgrades, there is some consideration involved in which upgrades you want to buy. There are also interception cards which give you a one-off opportunity to bend the rules, and occasionally mess around with your opponent.

There are some other minor neat touches to the game, like how the gravitational pull of the sun makes it quicker to travel towards the sun than to travel away from it, and how goods gradually dwindle in a quirky flipping mechanism. Overall, Perry Rhodan is a perfectly serviceable 2P game, although its gameplay sometimes borders on being nondescript.

What a disappointment.  I was hoping for more out of this, but this game is just rife with problems.  Early on in the game there are potentials for huge hauls.  If you get a big haul, you have a greater chance to get another big haul again when you get to the planet.  As the game progresses and the goods dry up there are fewer opportunities to deliver for big returns, so it can be virtually impossible to get enough points to catch up.  A couple bad breaks on the dice or good breaks on card flips will determine your game more than any decision you have to make.  

Also, it is slow moving getting through the deck.  If someone gets the technology to draw more cards they have an absurd advantage of the other player.  You never can cycle cards, so you don't have control over what you draw or what you can get to, so if you don't draw the right tech at the right time, you are effectively crippled.

If you can't get extra cargo, you are screwed.

The swap cargo card is terrible.

Lots of good ideas, but it just didn't feel finished.

Quickly morphing into one of our favorite two-player games.  Beautiful presentation and enough fun choices and experiences to fill up a half-hour.  The cards can certainly go against you, but being a short game it's not really a flaw in my mind.  You can still get a good strategy going with what is provided to you.

It was fun for much less time than the game took.   It started out fun, and then got tiring.  Had the decks been different so that each ship had a different strategy, that would have helped.  It might be good for kids (but also might be too complex).  I didn't feel like I had many interesting decisions to make.

A pretty fun, very light pick up and deliver game -- in space. It does have a pretty cool way to randomize and control the resource distribution. If I only had 30 minutes and one other player, I guess this would be pretty fun. Mostly, though, I'd rather play Merchants of Venus! 

--- Summary ---
Place the 9 planet cards in a line. The goods cards are double-sided; randomize them, then place several on each planet grouped by type (but no more than 2/type/planet to start). Players' ships start on planet 1. Each has their own deck, shuffled; draw 5 card hand. The cards are mostly tech cards, which can give you ongoing power; or single-use cards (counter opponent's card by playing matching card yourself). Spend VP to play the cards.

On your turn, move your ship (costs less energy moving towards sun), pick up stuff (start game with only 1 cargo hold), deliver stuff. When you deliver, you flip the delivered cards over; any resulting matches are removed from game -- works as a game timer! You win by getting to target (75?) VP, or if goods gone (most VP wins).

Not a bad game but not very interesting either. The second container seems to be an obvious choice and the player who gets it earlier in the game seems to have an obvious advantage - disclaimer: I've only played the game once so this is not a very relevant opinion.

I'm not a fan of the series (in fact I have never heard of it before this game) and I'm also not a big science fiction fan so, being this kind of game, with this kind of theme, that I don't care much, or that I couldn't care less, rating it a five and enjoying it sufficiently to play it now and then it's not totally bad.

There¬¥s a nice pacing, although once a player has a definite lead, he¬¥s hard to catch up. Bet then again, the game is so short that a rematch is easily played.

I like it but it feels really light. After many plays. It's a good couples game. Some of the cards that don't look good are deceptively powerful. The person who moves around the board most efficiently wins. It has two synergistic engines to play tactically, through movement or card play. Sometimes your best move is to stay light and not buy many persistent specials, sometimes it's better to collect them. I grew to like it much better after multiple plays.

I don't know who this Mr. Rhodan fellow is, but this is a truly brilliant little game!  It's portable, easy to learn, plays quickly, and has just the right mix of luck and strategy for a light, quick-playing game.  And who doesn't love that good ol' "pick up and deliver" mechanism?  It also appears to be quite well balanced, since in our first game I was poised to win but rolled poorly, which left the door open for my wife to win the game by a single point/Megagalex.  The components are mostly decent, although the sun/scoring track is poorly done and I've taken the time to create a new sun/reference card and a scoring card, both of which are available in the files section.  This is a perfect game for a gaming couple with very young children in the house (ie. my wife and I).  [Edit: I have become increasingly impressed with the tightness of this design with several more plays, and have upped my rating to a 9.]  Game design: 4.5/5  Personal enjoyment: 4.5/5  Total: 9/10

Mixed bag. The game is a bit randomish, as dice based space jumps plus randomized wares distribution means that lucky player can gain ten or something points of advantage. Moreover, there is no tight tense like in [gameid=50]. The cards aren't helping too much either and there's not too much room for some planning, rather players simply use opportunities. Design is not too bad but the game is lacking somehow. VP track without numbers is very cumbersome.

RATING: 7
[Kosmos 'Perry Rhodan: Die Kosmische Hanse' 08 edition] {Fantasy; roll-and-move, pick-up-and-delivery, utility cards}  Originally, I would like to wait for the English release; however, I can't wait for an English edition because it is so attractive - the space theme, pick-up-and-delivery mechanics are my favorite.

This is a good game for a couple.  Its game length is appropriate - it runs around 45 minutes.  It has nice player interaction in competing for the goods.  And, the tension grows as the game progresses.  It has mild confrontation, in which players can disturb the planning of an opponent and players need to prepare for counter attacks.  Drawing more cards per turn is quite important to have more tactical options.  In all, it has a good balance between tactical planning and luck, which enhances its replayability.

The game components are just so-so for me.  The card illustration is a little bit busy for me. It can come with a board to show the route of spaceships so that players need to rely on an "invisible" path.  The scoring board ("the Sun") is too small and it's easy to knock over the scoring markers and confuse the scores.  I prefer plastic spaceships than cardboard one, at this era.

I like pick-up-and-deliver games but this one is a bit vanilla. It's got simple rules but there's really no sense of development.  Its just a lot of moving around with not much planning.  I guess I was expecting more.

Negativity aside, this is easy enough to be a game to play with non-gaming spouses.  The cards look nice as well.

RATING: 6
Straightforward game where the object is to transport various goods to one of six different planets. You can upgrade your spaceship by purchasing different technologies which each bring certain benefits such as being able to transport more goods or increasing the distance you can move etc. There's a fair bit of randomness because you draw your available technologies from a card deck, which means that you won't necessarily have access to the power-ups you need. There's not a great deal of strategy required to win and the key to success seems to be drawing the 'container' technology cards early in the game, enabling you to transport more goods and therefore acquire more points before your opponent has the opportunity to do so. It's quite fun for what it is though.

tl;dr: fine, but why 2 player only?

This is mainly a pickup and deliver game with some cards to spice things up. It works well and I enjoyed it, but it didn't leave a big impression.
Some of the cards are a bit too powerful I think, so we opted not to use those.
The biggest question I had was: why is this only for 2 players? There's no reason you couldn't add a few more resource cards per planet so you can play with more.
All in all a decent game, but nothing special.

Just one step above Monopoly. There is the luck of the draw and the luck of the dice. The tech cards and intervention cards are straightforward (the choice is usually obvious) and the trading aspect (getting VP) is overly simplistic. 
The game can still be nice to play but is too complicated (counting the actions each turn) and too long for what it offers.
Other than that the game is quite thematic - except for the obvious ignorance of energy conservation!

I rather liked this one, but it didn't go over so well with my better half. Perhaps the space theme? In any event, the hand-management aspect of Perry Rhodan: The Cosmic League is what keeps this from being a very pedestrian pick-up-and-deliver game. Also giving players interesting options are the two types of cards ... the permanent technology cards that are increasingly expensive to play as the game progresses, and the intervention cards, which are free "instants" but limited to two per turn. I'm guessing that good card play and knowing when to stop building up your technology infrastructure and concentrate on scoring are the key game-deciders. For the record ... I kinda liked the theme and thought the mechanics fit it well.

Neat little 2-player version of Merchants of Venus. Players pilot their ships from one planet to the next, picking up goods along the way, delivering them to one of the six planets. Players can pay to build technology cards or play intervention cards to help themselves or hinder their opponent. First player to 70 Megagalax wins the game. This has a slight learning curve, but ends up being pretty simple to play. Very fun game that is only available in Germany.

Nifty.  It is a roll and move, pick up and deliver, hand management game.  I rate it a 9 and have played six times now, but I can't write a good comment on the game.  Its a pure efficiency game with minor screwage.  I'd imagine an experienced player would absolutely mop the floor with a newer player.  The cards really mix up the pacing and prevent the game from feeling same-y.  It is completely unlike any other 2 player game experience in my collection.  It ends up playing in under 30 mins with some experience.  No catch up mechanic, so the game is a pure race to 70. 

I'll revisit this write up with more plays.  I am not conveying the enjoyment this game is.

Excellent, quick pick up & deliver game. The dice roll can have a massive effect though. We use cards numbered 1-6 instead, and you have to use all 6 cards before you get any of them back. Makes the game a lot more strategic and less irritating for those who seem to constantly roll badly.

Bland and far too long for a 2 player game. That is the general consensus after a single play. The theme was appealing but the game play just wasn't up to snuff. Players move around between planets trying to ship cargo and earn money. Build your technologies to enhance your ship, use intervention cards to boost your travels, etc. Same stuff that is the staple of most sci-fi games. Because the game drags and overstays its welcome, I'd say give it a pass unless you absolutely love the theme.

My first impression of this game after the first couple of turns was, OMG another Fluxx how in the world is it that Joe likes this game.  But after completing the game I found there to be far more to the game.

The word that leaps to mind is 'inoffensive.'  Perry Rhodan is nice and fast, but it seems more like a way to pass the time than a good game.  The theme is not very strong, and the mechanics are not especially unique.  The symmetrical decks are good for game balance, but manage to make the game feel very samey -- even a difference of a card or two between the decks would have made it feel more interesting.  Still, pick-up-an-deliver games aren't that common outside of the [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/crayon_rail_games]Crayon Rails series[/url], and so it's nice to see another game try it.

Was originally going to give this what would have been a generous 7 but after some reflection am provisionally settling on a cautious 6. I think this is an excellent 'spouse' game (whatever that means) as the mechanics are easy to apprehend and the artwork is phenomenal. I rarely care about theme and presentation but the art here really grabbed me. Of course, the game must stand on its own merits to sustain my interest, which I'm skeptical of its ability to do given the simplistic pick up and delivery mechanism which alongside the cards is the heart if the game. I could see the pick up and deliver aspect get boring fast with its simplicity and repetitiveness but maybe familiarity with the deck provides that extra level of depth to push this to a game that would actually be worth playing more than a few times. At present, however, the card effects seem if anything a bit capricious and the card mechanic in general more of a "hope I get something useful" rather than a dynamic with actual depth. All in all though my first play was fun enough to warrant a second. We'll see how it goes from there.

RATING: 5
Well, it has a few neat things going on under the hood (I especially like the way the potential gain from a big delivery is balanced by the potential loss one could get for not having a viable delivery to pick up from a planet once you make a delivery), but this one didn't wow me like I was expecting it to.  I think it comes down to the fact that this is ultimately a race game, and that's not a class of games I really enjoy.  That said, I can see myself playing it again.  On occasion.  If other, better games weren't available.

This game is set in the Perry Rhodan  universe, a hugely popular German space-opera book series published since 1961. The term "kosmisch" means "cosmic" whereby "Hanse" refers to the Hanseatic League, a Medieval trade network in Northern Europe. In the american translation of the book series the term "Die Kosmische Hanse" was translated as "The Cosmic House".

In this game the players take on the roles of traders who transport goods between planets. Occasionally one can carry also passengers, which brings additional yields. Players can invest in cargo space, transmitters or faster drives to improve their spaceships.

This is a light game, and as with all 2-player-only games, it's hard to get it played. I like the puzzle of trying to gain the most profit from trading goods while dealing with the quirks of space travel. It's just a shame that there are a number of attack cards included among the limited action options. Also, the score board really needs to be bigger; it is hard to keep the ship tokens on the correct spots.

Well balanced, fast paced and simple ruled space-trading game. The game is better then i expected and the cards give it the right amount of flavour.

I've lost against my wife and i had 2 containers right on (3 later in the game). Not too much interaction, but there is some.

After over 30 games played my rating is still 9.5. There has been no score difference bigger that 5 Magagalax in our games. This is the best Kosmos 2P game i own (I own/used to own 13 of them).

Simple and easy 2 player game but with a lot going on. Really fast gameplay but on the same time still enough room for decisions and some strategy. Need to play it again to figure out the full potential of the game but so far it looks very promising.
Hats off to Kosmos for publishing a sci-fi game in their 2-player series.

PROS: Cool theme.
Great artwork.
Diminishing opportunities.
Some 'take-that!' and some action countering/canceling.

CONS: A bit tricky to teach.
Tokens are too large for the board.
Might have a first player advantage.

This is a really fun pick up and deliver game for two players.

RATING: 8
Fun and light game with a bit of strategy. The barman variant makes the game shorter and more appetible. 40/45 mins for a game. The best choice as a filler or between two gamers' games.

RATING: 6
Very very very nice art! 
The game itself is massively luck based and has a very short life, after maybe 10 games I'm tired of it.

When you are in the right mood this is a superb game to play. It's rich in it's theme and the game play backs up the theme nicely.

Strategy is deeper than it seems initially. 
Play it, absolutely, with Barman variant to make it shorter.

Very cute and tiny, light-hearted beer & pretzels game (somewhat literally). The interaction and the very well though out rules make this a big winner.

Found it in Essen last year, bought it, played it, sold it. Sitting around, waiting for the right diceroll, just boring. When i don't want use brain in games, i play Nuclear War :-)

RATING: 7
Very funny drinking game where gameplay suits reality well :-). There's still some strategy and tactics available too, so : good game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A bit of a permutation fest. Its definitely not a drinking game
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A roll-and-move game at its core, there's plenty of interesting decisions to be made (you roll two dice and assign them to 1-2 of your characters, like backgammon or Dragonland).  The barman variant is essential.

Fun little game; slightly too much luck for many people, with the Mind the Move edition not fancy-looking enough to lure non-players into a match. But fun and original. When presented in Essen, it was sold out very quickly, I was lucky to get some copies from Switzerland later.

Fantasy Pub is an excellent game with a great theme. A roll-and-move game at its core, there's plenty of interesting decisions to be made (you roll two dice and assign them to 1-2 of your characters, like backgammon or Dragonland). 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Not a bad game, but for me this game suffers from too many rules, and no player aids or aids on the character cards themselves to remind us of their special roles, pecking order, etc. Also a lot longer (at least with 4 players it took us 90 minutes I believe) than I thought it would be.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Fun, party-ish game. Very light but with a great theme (getting drunk!). My biggest problem is that the pub gets very cluttered fast, and its hard to handle so many cards with tokens on them.

RATING: 4
The idea behind the game and the mechanics are really good and original but the game doesn't work. It is really funny to play 30 minutes to Fantasy Pub but the game doesn't end after this time ... at my experience is very difficult to have the game reach the ends at all. I think that with some (small) fix in the rules ot coul be an excellent game!

Received 30/8/2007

11/2007 Fun filler with top notch hilarious theme.  Can become somewhat tedious when the pub fills up and you're dice rolls doesn't leave you any options.

[Played once]
Too long for being a filler so random (or too random to be a simple tactical game).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
After one game, I wasn't floored by it.  I guess it's because no one knew how to play and we had to figure out the rules and it took longer to get started.
I do see potential in this game and so the rating will probably go up.  
Number of beers required to end the game should be lowered so that it doesn't over stay it's welcome.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Well themed and, in its Tilsit incarnation, a very good looking game. The new rules incorporate the barman, so there is quite a bit of tactical choices here. Not sure whether more plays would reveal a strategic element, but I'm willing to try.
Played twice.

RATING: 6
Too luck-driven to be a strategy game, too long and static to be a filler.

But I appreciate its originality and theme. I will play this time to time.

I am a proud owner of this tiny lovable game.
Simple, easy, pretty, funny, wisely mixing luck and strategy.
Not a &quot;great&quot; production, poor quality of box and tiles, but also a low-price game. I love it.

RATING: 6
Cute and clever game. The components are quite flimsy and fairly fiddly (physically): thicker pieces and somewhat improved artwork would give it another point.

RATING: 5
I due dadi la fanno da padrone in questo gioco simpatico ma privo di qualunque aspetto innovativo. In pochi giocatori l'interazione è minima mentre in 5 i tempi morti sono troppi per un gioco che in realtà sarebbe da provare senza troppi calcoli. Simpatica l'ambietazione (un pub tra elfi e orchi) ma il gioco dura troppo per essere un filler e la dipendenza dai dadi è talmente forte da non permettere strategie a lunga scadenza.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Mechanics and setting are very nice and easy. Rules are bug-free, but 6 tables and 6-sided dice result often in strange situations! With 5 players it is VERY slow. Characters are difficult to handle (I have first edition with author's personally cut tokens, probably better materials would raise it to 5) with such thin counters and all the beers and coins above.
Barman variant adds more strategy.

Played once, five player game. Clever and thematically rich game. Initially, I thought it had a backgammon feel to it, which is good for me, but unfortunately, the game doesn't allow you to set yourself up strategically for "bad" rolls. Perhaps it's because we were playing a five player game and the game state changed so much between turns.

Fun game with a light hearted group. It is funny when someone is trying to leave the bar, but the character is too drunk to move, and then gets thrown out of the pub for having too much to drink.

This is a really cute game that unfortunately is a little too lucky and outlasts its welcome.  That said the theme is great and it works wonderfully.  I want to love this game, so I'm going to add a hand of cards from a deck of dice.  Hopefully that will speed the game up and give more options (maybe roll three dice and pick two).

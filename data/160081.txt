Kickstarter didn't deliver everything promised, but it's a fun, quick dungeon romp. Good for playing with kids too young for Descent.

RATING: 2
To simple as a pure Dungeon Crawler. Looks like it can't decide if it wants to be a Crawler or a Skirmish Game and fails on both sides.

Speed Bumps with the expansions - they "work" with the intended heroes and leaves you puzzeled sometimes with the "choose from every hero available" - combinations.

As some have said here: IF you are willing to invest some time to tweak / change / houserule... - sorry, I don't need a sandbox where I have to work on the stuff but want a game that works on itself.

Quality: OK, I'm not a miniatures-player / collector so I don't care that much (but the various colors give a funny scenery when placed on the table) but the traps / acrylic counters / resin counter upgrade are a joke. You could send them back for a refund (which I did not care about as I don't do for the game any more).
Then there was the hardcover - book with the misprints (which you could get replaced if you are willing to pay the postage - didn't care about this too).
And the missing scenarios which some obscure download-links / codes that don't work (no surprise I have to say). They send you a code to download the missing stuff then - after you used the link provided and enter the code - they tell you that the code is not for the product they linked you to?!?

A lot was promised and less fulfilled or sloppy fulfilled.

A solid dungeon crawler focusing more on tactics and less on advancement.

RATING: 5
Played one scenario (skipped the intro).  The rules were simple to pick up, the quality of the components reasonable.  Some of the minis looked well sculpted and would look great painted while others looked really fragile and not well detailed.

The scenario I played was a simple "exit the dungeon" mission and due to good dice rolls for me and/or poor rolls for the DM, I never really felt challenged.

It was okay, but felt very light compared to other dungeon crawlers like Descent or Secrets of the Lost Tomb.  I'd probably play again if asked but won't be looking for another session.

Ok, there are some weak spots, but if you grew up with Hero Quest as I did, this one gets you that feeling back. The Invisible Overlord system could be more balanced and defined. I like the Uncharted Dungeon option, which works quite well in the solo game.

If you overlook its flaws (and maybe we're a justifiably agitated KS backer), you'll find a very fun but light dungeon crawl that definitely channels Heroquest. It doesn't quite feel old, however, nor does it feel modern. But's it quite fun!

RATING: N/A
Would Doom and Conan be a better game with the Overlord system as compared to Dungeon Saga?

It is indeed a tactical game. Role playing is almost absent. Fighting is all you do.

"Wizards can cast spells like crazy, even two spells in the single turn.
I would have liked mechanics where casting was a big thing, and wizards would need sometimes to fight with normal weapons, but this is not the case."

A perfect old school "crunchy" dungeon crawl. Production issues aside (they're well documented) this is a great game when you're in the mood for some old school feeling skeleton bashing.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This was a big disappointment. The play mechanisms are simplistic, and the game is not fun for the players and less so for the Overlord. Also, it does not play solo out of the box. For that, you need to shell out another $50 for the Adventurer's Companion, which is even less thought out and developed than this (for more on that disaster, see my comments for the Adventurer's Companion). You get one "campaign," which is not really one since you don't get to pick how your heroes develop from scenario to scenario. 

Traded away at first opportunity.

RATING: 7.5
Simple (but not simplistic) dungeon crawl. Great minis and the KS version was great value for money. Major fumbles with the Adventurer's Companion though. For me, the jury is still out on the very rigid Move First, Act Second game design. Feels too "gamey". That said, I'm still enjoying the game, so that says something about the basic design being solid. 

(Edit: after having played 10 games - so far - I think the rating will remain at 7.5... because of the cheesy OL victory conditions of crippling a hero to win... usually that means targeting Danor, the wizard. Cheesy, cheesy...)

Autentico heredero de warhammer quest. Se vuelve a respirar el ambiente de exploración y mazmorreo d&d de antaño. 
Tiene la mejor IA, creación de mazmorras y sistema de exploración de todos los dungeon crawlers del mercado. Incluso en el modo totalmente cooperativo, nunca sabes si vas a activar una trampa ya sea pisandola o como por efecto de abrir una puerta o un cofre.

A todo añadir un sistema de combate muy sencillo y táctico donde hay que tener a los guerreros delante y magos y arqueros detrás por lo que pueda aparecer. Shadows of brimstone tiene muchas ideas buenas (la mayoría copiadas de warhammer quest), pero el sistema de combate es demasiado estático y carece totalmente de estratégia con respecto a éste de Dungeon Saga.

Le quito un punto a falta de unos retoques en el tema de equilibrado de dificultad en el modo solitario/cooperativo.

excelente juego

Pretty poor, over-simplified dungeon crawler. As the DM I didn't feel like I had any interesting decisions to make. I can't imagine playing a whole campaign of this when its centered around such a simple core mechanic - my group and I got bored mid-way through the first mission.

I've only played the first scenario.  For me there were too few options for all except the magic user.  I appreciate that it's a campaign and you have to level up to become  powerful, but as the game started with us having so little agency we were not inspired to play further.

However, the rules are very simple for the players (don't know about for the DM), and setup didn't take too long.

Core Game is solid players vs multiple player experience, easy to learn, more like a puzzle game in positioning and hero activation ordering than a traditional go kill the monsters dungeon crawl, components about average in quality certainly not top tier.

Had a playthrough of the first mission of this yesterday.
The miniatures are functional, about as good as Descent first edition (and bore only a passing resemblance to those pictured). The board sections are the worst I've seen in a game of this type and held together with fiddly plastic clips.

The gameplay (as a hero) was unbalanced, the wizard had a lot of cards and dice rolling (which amounted to very little game effect in the end)the other player characters were bland with no more options than Heroquest, the 'DM' turn seemed overlong and lead to long downtime for the players. 

With Descent 2, Arcadia Quest, Shadows of Brimstone and many others available there is no reason to prefer this.

One of my fellow players commented "at least it passed the time". That is the best thing I can think to say about this game.

This is basically the Mantic Version of Heroquest. The player and monster miniatures vary between 'ok but not exceptional' an 'very nice', I like the furniture bits though.

I didn't like the plastic clips to hold together the boards, you might want to try to play without them.

A very simple game, probably good with younger players or for those moments when a beer & pretzels game is what you need.

This game has the reputation to be a Hero Quest 2.0.
Well, I played Hero Quest in my youth with my friends and don't remember it as an overly exciting game. Would I play it now it may be different. 
Dungeon Saga on the other hand feels exciting... The minis, the furniture, the theme, the artwork. It's really easy to imagine that it's you, who fights in the dungeon to defeat ghouls and skeletons :D
I never played Descent, the game DS is compared with most. The rules seem a bit easier and the fighting system with just D6s more beginner friendly.

I just finished my very first Solitaire DS game and, must say, it was actually quite fun! Even when my dwarf died honorably after he holded Revenants back for several rounds to let others push forward. My scenario was one of the first ones, "Adventure 2: Into The Depths".

My heroes never made it, but that's actually a good thing, I think. It seems that the solo games are not just a walk in a park what I feared at first.

I played only with the original Adventure Companion without errata and didn't notice any game breaking errors yet. Maybe they'll be found when I start a campaign. I didn't use any kind of "Overlord-timer" either. Found it more enjoyable as I wasn't in a hurry. I just wanted to enjoy all of my sneaky tactics. And still couldn't make it at first attempt. Very nice!

This game is supposed to be a Heroquest alternative. A light dungeoncrawl. Unfortunately, the basic game has almost no options. You don't search, look for traps, or do any quests. Instead, players only do one thing every turn: attack.

This might be okay for a while, but a whole dungeon with only one action to do gets boring real fast. The combat system is also really simple. So it really becomes a diceroll fest with a bit of tactics thrown in. Skirmish games like Dungeon Command at least had more options for combat.

I think perhaps the Adventurers Companion (which adds in some optional adventuring rules) might improve the experience, but the base game on its own is pretty bland.

RATING: 8
The quality of the components is top notch. It reminds me of the feeling I had in the 90's when I first opened my box to HeroQuest, with all the furniture, tiles, and minis inside... since then, my expectations for miniatures games has grown exponentially, so I'm rarely impressed with miniatures games anymore, no matter how great they are. But this game brought back that initial reaction of, "WOW!" The only games that does miniatures and tiles better is Games Workshop with Space Hulk 4th Edition... but that game didn't have furniture, and required significant assembly! If these guys ever put out a sci-fi game, I'll be the first to jump on that boat.

Game rules seem rather basic at first glance and certain situations at times not so clear. If you (and your group) can deal with that, there is still a lot of strategy to consider when going head to head between dungeon overlord and heroes. Guess it only works with 2 players as the heroes must use the cover of each other's front arcs to protect the weaker heroes. The result is that the movement of a single hero kinds of reduces the strategically succesful moves for the other players. Maybe 3 player is doable but definitly 5 players would be an intensive 4 player cooperation vs dungeon lord.

The game is certainly enjoyable and the mini's are looking cool in the tabletop setting which is enhanced by the nicely sculpted funiture.

I will definitely finish the campaigns. It would be nice if Mantic would have some time to clarify certain aspects of the rules.

It's a very good dungeon crawler, although it's non perfect.
There are some defects like maype longevity of the game (resolving with expansions) and there isn't equipment random search (by reason of balance the game).
But the game is very funny and quick!!! There's also a part of strategy about the miniatures placement and a fantastic magic management!!!

In many ways this is an evolution of classic fantasy dungeon crawls like Heroquest, it may not die anything particularly original but what it does it does well. Therules have been refined to be simple to understand, the miniatures may not be the best quality but they’re still good and you get plenty of them, and you get enough tiles to build a lot of different setups. Ontop of this the low price point makes it a great entry point from for new players.

Great fun- though the D6 system makes buffs players and monsters get a little too big.
House-ruled it to work on a D12 and it works a treat so far.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The good-

I love random dungeon layouts and this system is a big improvement over the old space hulk system. It has several stages of dungeon and you randomly pick a card from each stage. This means you always start with a small entrance area and over time move to larger boss fight style rooms... not so random after all!? The card based interrupt system also keeps things tense and interesting even when playing against AI.


The Bad-
I don't love the combat... No pushing or knockbacks to keep the battle shifting and no exploding dice results in a very static battlefield! I may house rule this but for now I'll give it more chances to prove itself.

Alfter a few games by biggest disappointment is the tile system. They don't connect well and they are so light they always shift! I hated the tiles in the original dwarf kings hold and these are just as bad. In the end I ordered some resin floor tiles (Malice Tombs)to build my own rooms. I hate trying to store these strangely shaped thin cardboard tiles because they always warp. With the resin set (no walls) I can just toss them in a box and know they won't warp! 

Update 1: after a few more plays this has really grown on me. Now that the characters have a few skills there are interesting combos and more branching paths.

Update 2: it's time to decide if this is worth keeping. I really wanted it for the solo random dungeon adventures. These work well but lack any real excitement/tension. They work in the classic space hulk fashion of see how many levels deep you can go into the dungeon but they really lack any sense of real tension or purpose. In the end I feel like Myth is far better at creating tension and dynamic battles... Maybe I can combine these two somehow!

No external shrink wrap, but everything else is in the original packaging. Some of the hero sheets have some bent corners due to packaging. The same is true of the Overlord sheet. It's minor.

Only played the two introductory scenarios which were easy hero victories. However, we got a taste for the game's potential so I'll rate it properly after more plays. Update: I painted the minis and was the overlord in a five-player game. Adventure 1 was no cake walk for the heroes and just squeaked by for the win.  The game is more tactical than what first appears and everyone enjoyed the game.

Mantic or MegaCon. Who is worse? I can't decide.

CONFIRMED: Games that play best with 4+ people should not include dice-comparison mechanics. Worst. Mechanic. Ever.

Graphic design on the player cards is terrible. Miniatures are passable at best. Companion book is laughable. Dungeon clips. Seriously? DUNGEON CLIPS?

Terribly designed. Poorly produced. Ineptly fulfilled.

Very strong theme, It is a unique category of dungeon party crawling. I played the campaign and loved the story, also I like the fact that every hero is useful and needed. The game requests total Teamwork and every hero feels unique and that is something  that makes it special.

Backed on Kickstart. Demoed at Gencon 2015. It has the best feel of a dungeon crawl RPG game. things like which way your character is facing and attacks of opportunity matter. I am so excited about this game. I loved the feel of the demo of the game, and the dice pool is great. It may not be a d20 system, but they did a great job of dice pool.

Played  a good range of the necromancer scenarios at mantis games for the pre beta rules release invite in February 2015.

Simple game with a couple of unclear rules however plays fast with enough tactics to stay interesting.

Rating is for normal rules rather than the more advanced from the infamous adventurers companion that should have rules for experience. Based off of being able to play the kids.
Looking forward to the full release.

First play very promising. Upper tier quality for components, but not boutique level (better than Descent, worse than Kingdom Death). The minis will fit right in with almost any 28-32mm fantasy line.

Loses value quickly as a co-op. It's okay, but definitely designed to take on the Descent v1 more than WHQ, which is my personal gold standard of dungeon crawling goodness.

An excellent dungeon crawling game with beautiful dark-ish aesthetic. It's light on the rules and is easy to learn, yet it has enough depth with tactical miniature gameplay and clever rules for using standard d6's. Lack-luster co-op rules that come with the Adventurer's Companion expansion stop this game from being perfect at what it tries to accomplish.

Wow, really a good game. Maybe the best dungeoncrawl since Heroquest/Warhammer Quest. Dungeon Saga is something between Descent and Hero Quest: quite tactical like the former, simple like the latter.

Some really good features make it shine - I like mostly the miniature orientation (something that remembers me Space Hulk and miniatures games) and the possibility to have a bonus striking from the back, attacks of opportunity on disangage, superior numbers taken into account during combat, light exploration factor due to a map that disclose itself door after door, and a great magic implant that really differentiate ranged and magical attacks (like Heroquest, wizards have spells in the form of personal and unique cards; those gradually rotate to recharge in an original way).

Another thing I greatly appreciated is the low power play and the fact that heroes lose the game if only one of them dies during a quest. Not stupid, unrealistic videogame-like respawns, really the need for tactical play to protect less armoured heroes (like the wizard and the elf).

Sadly it's the worst mantic game (huge dreadball and deadzone player here), it uses a different, simplier mechanic and it's not as deep.
Component quality is ok, Advanced rules are terribile, Overlord does not advance in any way his deck, but only his minions can gain experience (useful only in custom adventures, because in the premade ones you encounter the bosses only in few occasions)

I like this more than Descent 2.0 and I'm playing it solitare.  I find the solo rules to actually be quite smooth once you learn them and presents a decent, entertaining challenge.  I like the artwork and the themes.  I have Infernal Crypts and Return to Val. as well. 

But as others have said, they'res nothing new to this game.  Everything has been seen in one game or another, but it's a solid dungeon crawl and I'm a sucker for those. :)

A very good mix between Heroquest and Descent. Loved how Mantic managed to strike just the right balance between the two. I thought this game would be just a tribute to the dungeon crawls of old but it is surprisingly engaging. I'm already looking forward to play through all the content the KS delivered. A must buy for dungeon crawl lovers out there.

However simple the mechanism of the gameplay might seem, I admire the efforts of the designers of incorporating the RPG experience into a tabletop game... since the eighties tabletop wargaming and rpg have been two different entities...not since heroquest have I got the flavor of the culture of dungeon crawling.  D&D incorporated with branding, and Desecnt caught up with mechanics of individual entities, this differs in bringing old school rpg, into something easily brought to the table.

I think DS is nothing really new, but it is a solid good game. Faults: tiles a bit too small and dark; fonts on some cards too small and difficult to read; 3d door models can't be opened. Pros: core rules very fast, simple and fun; cooperation needed between heroes; a lot of room for customization (even without the Adventurer's Companion).

Dungeon Saga lacks some good graphic design, and its minis are not the most detailed models on the market, BUT, the game itself is very good. 

It provides simple rules and at the same time a real challenge to tackle. Each of the four heroes are balanced and provides a different gameplay. The game system is super versatile and can be used to create any heroic fantasy game you like, as long as it's taking place in a dungeon! Great game.

The quest is very rich and provides a good variety of dramas to play.

Solo es lanzar dados. A veces ni puedes moverte porque el overlord te bloquea. Le única opción que tienes ahí es lanzar dados y ya. Se acabó el juego. Ni cartas para modificar ni nada de nada. En el modo campaña cambiará, pero hasta que tengas algo para hacer pueden pasar muchas partidas aburridas. Si me juego un risk me divierto más.

Very solid dungeon crawler. Requires some set up. I enjoy it and find it ok to teach others. Characters in game are a little flat and uninspired, as is the story and backdrop.

While it succeeds in evoking that nostalgia for Heroquest, there were so many questionable decisions made with the design (like the wizard being the only one who can unlock doors, on rails character progression, and timed missions) it left me feeling disappointed.

The game will likely sit on my shelf while the miniatures get used for other things,

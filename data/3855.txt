Big rulebook. Long turns. The excess detail in damage limits de player handling of craft to 2 or 3 at most. No altitude makes this game a bunch of dice rolling and damage allocation rather than "dogfighting". And it has the battletech problem of the bigger the craft the better it is. Smaller craft are nuissence.

While clearly derived from older FASA games of the Renegade Legion series, Crimson Skies is playable, and funny enough to make it a campaign game. I did not play the heroclix version, but again I don't like collectible thing games as they are too expensive.

It's a lot of fun trying to outmaneuver your opponents to line up a shot without giving them a shot too.  The simultaneous movement and the damage mechanics are both great.  Not a realistic if that's important.  Provides solid rules for character advancement over multiple combats.  Unfortunately, some of the rules for missiles need to be reworked in my opinion.  And the game just takes a while to play...if I could get the same fun out of 1-1.5 hrs, I'd rate this a 9.  I like this better than the Wizkids version.

RATING: N/A
One of my all time favorites, if not the best in my mind.  The blind navigation system is extremely fun to try to guess where people will be.  And the damage system is very satisfying to look at as well as the satisfaction from shearing someone's wing off.  Pure fun in a box.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Fun background: pulp airplane combat. A basic airplane construction system in the main release, with some minor tweaks in later supplements. I like the movement system a great deal: simultaneous maneuver choice, with healthy amounts of risk-taking possible. You could try to go to fast, and stress your engine; trying too radical a maneuver would damage your wings. The damage system was problematic: I like the system in general (it's also seen in the Renegade Legion series of games), but it never felt right for the genre. I understand that it probably makes for a more satisfying game, but I always feel like airplane combat should reward getting the first shot or two in, instead of turning into a slugfest. Still a fun game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A Fun game of aerial combat in a really neat setting. This isn&#039;t really complicated, but it is very long and quite paper intensive. Again not really one of those games where winning is the ultimate goal, but rather to have a lot of fun and see who&#039;s plane can blow up in the most stylish fashion.

Crimson Skies.  My absolute, number one, favorite setting in all of games.  I couldn't give you one reason why, but pulp action, 1930s era aircrafts, and a divided U.S. are three.  Granted, I've never played either this or the WizKids Clix game, as it's always been more of a collecting item for me.  I like the art, the false photography, and the alternate historical background.  I did however enjoy the two CS games for the PC and original Xbox.

Awesome game.
Hexmaps and the use of minis remind one of BattleTech a bit, but I think this game far outshines BattleTech both in the game itself and in the background and stories that support the game world.
I mean: Who doesn't love sky pirates, zeppelins and armed and armored fighter planes in a 1930's pulp era?

I heavily recommend the supplement book "Behind the Crimson Veil" though, since it adds aircraft characteristics that add a whole new layer of coolness. Plus, there's price tags for aircraft components in there that'll help when playing a campaign.

I've played a couple 3er games each of us w/2 fighters.  Each player secretly records his planes' moves for a turn.  It actually is a pretty fun game.  You resolve a lot of the thematic components (acceleration, G's, hits, damage location) via d10 die roll.  As your fighter takes more damage, different things can happen depending on location of the damage.  I think that's where the fun is.  The strategy is guessing what grid/direction your opponent is recording so you can record a grid/direction that allows you to shoot him while not getting shot yourself.

This game was a lot of fun to play.  Growing up with Battletech, I was really interested to see how Fasa would deliver on a aviation dog fight.  My friends and I played this game quite a bit. We created a campaign in which they ran a small pirate group and would attack merchant zepplins and run missions.  It was a blast and the detailed plane sheets that let you pinpoint your damage to sheer off that wing or slowly burn through your enemies armor with phosphorous rounds made for some great tension and fun.

To my mind this is the crowning achievement of FASA.  The fun and crunchy damage system from the Renegade Legion games coupled with a simultaneous movement system very similar to that found in Blue Max makes for a very fun and dynamic dogfighting game.

I also really like the way maneuver restrictions work, with each maneuver having a g-rating which a particular airframe may or may not be able to take.  The ability to push the envelope adds a great deal to the excitement level.

The alternate history setting has a terrific feel to it too.

I own the original boardgame and use the WizKids planes for minis.  (Busted off the bases and remounted on 1" fender washers, and stuck a circle of felt on the bottom.)

RATING: 5.5
We had a lot of fun with it. Especially the damage system is very satisfying as you actually see the damage you've made to the other guy's plane as he crosses off the little squares on his sheet. I always thought there wasn't much point to have a lighter plane as manoeuvers were seldom very helpful as long as you can guess where the other guys will be going, but maybe it was just us playing brutally. Now I don't think it will get played a lot anymore, it's just a little too long and boyish.

RATING: 7
An off-shoot of the development process for the eponymous video game. The basic box set was very well done, and the early metal miniatures were great. The big draw, apart from the setting, were the damage rules (using templates adapted from FASA’s own earlier Renegade Legion games) and the simultaneous plotting of maneuvers on a preprinted hex chart.
–
Unfortunately, FASA tanked shortly after this game was published; the few later add-on books that did come out were not very good, and nearly all the plane illustrations in them looked weirdly bloated, ponderous and ugly. We played this only a few times, but it seemed solid.

This is the boxed game, NOT the collectable aircraft game released by Wizkids.  The game also has two small format books of 'Spicy Air Tales', a sort of  fictional storyline idea containing scenarios and short stories.  Also there is the supplement entitled "Aircraft Manual" giving additional aircraft designs.  At the moment I can't find the Spicy Air Tales booklets, but I do have the Blake Aviation Security expansion book

The planes are good for play, and the maps are clear and gorgeous.  However, there is too much guess going on when flying, so instead of a battle of wit, it is a battle of playing the odds and hoping the opponent ends up in front of you.

Crimson Skies is in my opinion the peak game FASA ended with. While the access for new player is a bit cumbersome, the mechanisms themselves help to provide a much more streamlined gameplay than in Battletech while still retaining the visual damage model. Another bonus is, that the game as a rules construct is complete when owning only the Core Box and the expansion book "Behind the Crimson Veil".

I often compare this game to its ideological successor X-Wing, and still come to the conclusion that even with the fancy pants shiny models and franchise X-Wing loses out to this very rare gem of a game.

Love the setting and the original plane designs. Tracking damage won't be for everybody, and the maneuver template imposes a learning curve that makes this a hard game to introduce new players to, which is ultimately its biggest drawback.

My biggest regret in regards to this game is that FASA never got a chance to publishing proper campaigns or campaign design guidelines and advice.

I liked PC game and like boardgame as well. Although it is in reality only 2D game (there is no height). I like very much combat system, especially damage sheets. Your plane gets crippled almost with every hit, which further reduces your chances and forces you to take risky maneuvers.

"The most thrilling aerial adventure!"
The setting of this game alone is worth a 10 and I love it. I discovered this through the PC game which came out after the board game and gives you  a sense for the great atmosphere.

"Fantastic aircrafts never before seen!"
The alternate history airplanes are customizable and very stylish.

"Dashing Heroes and deadly Femme Fatales!"
You can create your own pilots and level them with experience points. How cool is that.

"If it's got this much Action..."
The dogfigthing offers some nice tactical decisions and mixes good with the trashy dice rolling.

"If it's got this much Style..."
I love the RPG elements which give many possibilities for scenarios, stories and campaigns.

"If it's got this much Drama..."
The only downside is that a play can be very time time-consuming.

"It must be... Crimson Skies!"
How can you not love it?

Battletech meets aerial pulp fiction. 

I missed this game hitting the market ( too deep into M:tg and W40k at the time to notice much else )

The mechanics for damage, armor allocation, internal structure, hit allocation is reminiscent of Battletech. The game has different ammo types with different damage patterns. It is possible to penetrate armor without completely ablating it (see Battletech) This is clever and interesting.

What a great game! All the expansions add to the really fun theme while the character and plane check-off sheets and plane minis make it a personal favorite, though slow to teach and it seldom comes out with new players. Online resources, especially the application "cadet" for printing character/plane sheets really add to the playability.  Heroscape hex terrain can be used for great Crimson Skies boards. I wish the game never fell by the wayside. Can you imagine if FASA continued to grow Crimson Skies in the direction it started out?

This old boardgame from FASA is one of my top faves.  A solid dogfighting game that (just like my other FASA favorite: Battletech) really does a great job of helping you to visualize what's happening in the battle, from watching your magnesium rounds burn through your opponent's plane over the course of several rounds working their way towards that oh so flammable fuel tank, to marking off box by box the inner workings of your own plane due to damage until you finally realize your wing has been blown off.  Some people hold its lack of elevation rules against it, but this is an awesome game.

On top of that, this game has one of the coolest settings out there and practically oozes theme.    I so wish they'd have come out with an RPG for it, similar to the way they did Mechwarrior for Battletech.  Sigh.

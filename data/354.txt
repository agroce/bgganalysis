Sticheln is one of my top trick-taking games.  What's great about Sticheln is how it turns the concept of trump on it's head and beats it flat.  When playing, you're always looking at how you an screw your opponents and considering how the people who follow you in each turn might be able to screw you.

I really enjoy this game since it has such strange mechanics.  I think it plays quite a bit differently with more than 3 than it does with 3, but it's all good.

In pre-BGG days I got the rules translated by a German-speaking friend of a friend.  "You play this game for fun?" he asked.  A cruel little gem of a game it is too.  Tough to interest non-card players in as there's no theme at all.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Interesting trick-taking game where you choose a colour to avoid each round, which means it is difficult to win tricks without losing more than you gain, as players don't have to follow suit, so can play to mess you up.  Takes a bit of time to get your head around!

RATING: 7
hard to wrap your head around.  angst is at or above schotten-totten levels with 3 players, which seems really unique.  high screwage and defense.  cards are high quality but it has no theme and the number art isn't even attractive.  good quick game for 3.  not ultra replayable though.

After a few plays, I'm starting to get it.  It's a very interesting take-that trick-taking game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
It's a big pleasure to be able to stick people with points, but eventually people start trying to take safe tricks themselves, and things become a bit more strategic. I like, a lot. It seems to be difficult to teach people this, though; even when I say so multiple times, someone will trump a trick with an unusually high card. Usually repeatedly.

A dry, scientific card-counting game with a bit of take-that with three or four; with seven or eight, a lot of laughs.

One of the most counter-intuitive games I've played in a long time.  fter on play, still have no idea of a good strategy.  Lots and lots of screwage, and apparently if you're willing to take the effort, counting cards can give you a great advantage.  Getting a positive score can be a big deal.  Don't short yourself in your pain color or you may be forced to trump some very expensive tricks.  

There's got to be some skill here, because the good card players walk away with the wins, and they do count cards which is important.

Wizard a négyzeten! Pár mondatos szabály, de nagyon mély a játék, szuper! Egyetlen hátránya, hogy egy könnyed kártyajátékhoz képest túl hosszú, tehát be- vagy levezetőnek azért durva. 5 fővel, 5 körös játék 2 és fél óra volt nekünk! Azért ilyen időtartamra sokkal jobb játékok is vannak már. És hogy miért ilyen hosszú? Mert minden egyes kártyán el lehet gondolkodni. Nem tudom, van-e még egy ilyen kártyajáték, ahol bármit tehetünk. Nincs színre színt, nincs ütéskényszer, teljes szabadságot ad a játék, nincsenek egyértelmű helyzetek, mint pl. a wizardban. Pont ezért ilyen hosszú, egy 5 fős 5 körös játéknál 5 x 5 x 15 lapot játszunk ki összesen, nagyon elhúzódhat! Persze 20-30 játék után biztos gördülékenyebben menne...

RATING: 8
Another of these great simple games, with a machiavelic point that make them absolutely a delight to play.  It can be nasty sometimes, but it is absolute fun.  It plays a bit tricky about who is winning the round, but this is what makes it so good.  The winner of the round is the highest card of a colour different than the starting one.  The scoring makes the second part.  Every player starts his scoring pile with a card chosen from the initial hand.  This will be his negative color.  Every card you get of this color, scores as many negative points as the number in the card.  For any other color, each card is one point.
With these two simple ideas you get a wonderful game.

No more than a whist variant. A simple trick taking card game in an over priced deck engineered to make it just different enough not to be playable with a standard deck of cards. A simple tweak makes it playable with a standard deck and really doesn't diminish the structure of the game at all. For my 2d that just makes it an over priced version of whist not worthy of purchase.

I have had this on my wishlist for the longest time, finally pulled the trigger and I am very glad I did. It is right up my street, a nasty, painful, whist-type game which will make your brain hurt. It was brilliant with 3 on first play, but I think it will be a little less tactical and a lot more chaotic/luck-based as the number of players goes up. Further updates after later plays.

* Nope - still enjoying this and it plays well with more.

Okay.  Seven people for this game is too many.  Yeah, it can play with seven but if you are not one of the last 2-3 to play in a trick, you just don't have any control.  Seven people, I would rank it a 3.  But, I plan on trying again with less (3-5) as I imagine the game will improve.  If not, the rating will drop.  It was painful with seven.  It really was.

Update:  Played with 3 and found it quite awesome!  Rating now reflects that.  I have to get a copy back.

RATING: 5
A very unique trick-taking game.  One of the rare games of this type that work exceedingly well with three.  I actually have reservations about the amount of control with more players.  Perhaps, like Category 5, more players replace some of the skill with the pleasure of hosing someone.

Nice and Nasty. In one trick you can score either a very small ammount of positive points, or a HUGE ammount of negative points.

With three players it's quite the calculating game experience. The more players, the more chaos you have. Myself, I prefer it with 4. It's probably not wortwhile with more than 5.

RATING: 4
very strange & non-intuitive trick-taking game.  I need to play again.  ** UPDATE: the 2nd play didn't help.  Game still seems too luck-heavy and too chaotic.  Perhaps it's a matter of getting to know your opponents over the course of the rounds... such as figuring out who usually holds high cards of opponents pain colors at the end of the round vs. who saves zeros and low numbers. ** UPDATE: my feeling after 3rd play is that it hardly matters what you do because you have very little control (and little information about which cards your opponents have compared to traditional trick-taking games).

The more I play this game, the more I like it.  Easier to teach than to learn.  (They always look at you like "I'm not stupid, I get it, already!" after you repeat the definition of trump a few times -- and then two tricks later, they look astonished that they took a particular trick.)

One of the best trick-taking games, ever. The rules are pretty simple though since it's so different from anything else you've likely played before it can take a couple games to really understand the strategy and play well. Especially good if you've got a cutthroat group. I like having to decide if I want to screw someone else over or get some more points for myself.

Update: We've been playing this with two pain suits for the past few years. At first we allowed doubling up on one color for double the negative points, but that was too easy so now you must choose two different colors. It's great. Highly recommend playing this way after you've gotten the hang of the game.

RATING: 8
10+ plays (3p, 6p, 7p many times [different 7ps]) Excellent, simple but with a couple huge twists. And I think it plays quite well with 7 people, which impresses me in any game. Fast play too even with 7. (Can even handle 8 players but I haven't tried that yet.) I'd love Sticheln even if that weren't true, but with its high performance for that many players, it offers a rare form of gaming excellence. That means Sticheln has quite a lot of value for my gaming needs. High and low cards are valuable, another plus. Terrific time with gamers who enjoy trick taking games combined with humorous "mean" play. Without that spirit the enjoyment might suffer. But I've seen it bring out the charitably laughing cruelty and mock-animosity in players who have a record of not liking "take that" games. It can be long with 6, 7 players, but turns go so fast. (Cards are well designed with one serious complaint: brown and magenta suits are hard to distinguish in the the low light that gaming situations seem to seek out, with no suit patterns to assist). I've been cursed more when playing this than when playing rugby or urban driving. Uproarious times, fabulous game, a treasure!

Such an evil game! Took me a while to rate as it's not at all obvious after the first couple of plays what you're doing and therefore if I really liked it. But I do, so much!

It's such a disarming game for regular trick-taking fans as a lot of the basic concepts are rather counter-intuitive. Then, once you feel like you're getting the knack of the basics you start to wonder how on earth it's possible to play cleverly and avoid pain. Not as straightforward as it appears, and you need to take calculated risks! Great stuff.

2007-02: Found reasonably priced at Buck's Craving For A Game, so here it is now in my collection.  First play was good.  It doesn't follow standard trick taking game conventions, so it does take round or two to get the hang of.  I don't think Barb or Brennan fully "got it" so their feelings on the game probably don't mirror mine.  Second play was a four-player game.  I like it, but it is hard to figure out, at least some of the time, whether this game is as much about winning tricks as it is about screwing others.  Also not entirely sure how to play this game well.

This is one of my favorite trick-taking games. The issue is that it is hard to teach new players. It takes quite a while for people to get used to the freedom they have in which card they can play.

RATING: 6
A refreshingly unforgiving and brutal trick-taking game, but this game is marred by underconstrained card play and odd pacing. The misery suit, the harsh penalties for misplay, and the lack of a requirement to follow suit make this an extremely brain-burning card game. Players can succumb to analysis paralysis, and the game actually slows in the middle third of a round, as the decisions become more difficult with less cards, unlike most card games. Counting cards in your misery suit is almost required, and a bad hand can destroy four previous well-played rounds , so it's not at all light. Fun with a crowd familiar with card games and that plays quickly, it does have a large amount of subtlety, making first plays difficult.

Components: The physical quality of the cards is up to Amigo standards; the artistic design is not.

Experience: An unintuitive trick-taking game. It's interesting to budget my cards, hoping to sneak a few high misery cards to the other players, and ensuring that I always have an out if faced with taking a miserable trick.

Oh, this game is mean and backstabbing fun. You put a misery suit out in front of you that everyone knows and you'll then have people chucking that suit at you all day long. Not uncommon to have negative points for a total score. If you're looking for a "stick it to you" card game, this is it. Can be depressing, though.

great twist on trick-taking.  I don't like Hearts, but the targeting in this game is necessarily less direct, as being void in the suit led doesn't mean you can dump points on someone, but rather that you are more likely to win the trick yourself.  but taking tricks that others don't want has its benefits, too.

Préparation
Sticheln se joue avec un jeu de 114 cartes de 6 couleurs numérotées de 0 à 18.

A 3 joueurs, utiliser les cartes de 0 à 8 dans 5 couleurs uniquement .
A 4 joueurs, utiliser les cartes de 0 à 11 dans 5 couleurs uniquement.
A 5 joueurs, utiliser les cartes de 0 à 14 dans 5 couleurs uniquement.
A 6 joueurs, utiliser les cartes de 0 à 14 dans les 6 couleurs.
A 7 joueurs, utiliser les cartes de 0 à 17 dans les 6 couleurs.
A 8 joueurs, utiliser les cartes de 0 à 18 dans les 6 couleurs.
Il y a également des cartes 19 et 20 en Bleu, Rouge et Vert qui ne servent que pour une des variantes (Note : dans la première édition de Sticheln, le jeu ne se jouait qu'à 6).

But du jeu
Accumuler un maximum de points en remportant des plis tout en évitant de récupérer des cartes de sa propre couleur maudite. Chaque carte gagnée d'une couleur différente de sa couleur maudite rapporte +1pt quelque soit sa valeur. Chaque carte gagnée de sa couleur maudite rapporte des points négatifs à hauteur de sa valeur. Une partie se fait en 5 manches.

Après avoir été désigné au hasard, le premier joueur distribue 15 cartes à chacun (14 cartes à 8 joueurs). A chaque nouveau pli, le premier joueur change en suivant le sens horaire. Les joueurs déterminent ensuite leur couleur maudite, ils choisissent une carte de leur main et la place face cachée devant eux. Le choix est délicat d'autant plus que cette carte sera également comptabilisée en fin de partie (points négatifs). Les joueurs révèlent simultanément leur carte maudite.

Les plis
Le premier joueur pose une carte qui détermine la couleur de départ pour le pli en cours. Dans ce jeu, toutes les cartes des autres couleurs sont des atouts.

Un pli est attribué en fonction des règles suivantes :

    Si tous les joueurs ont joué dans la couleur de départ, c'est le joueur qui a joué la carte la plus forte qui remporte le pli,
    Autrement le pli est remporté par le joueur qui a posé la carte la plus forte dans une des couleurs d'atouts. Mais attention, une carte d'atout de valeur 0 est toujours ignorée, celui qui la joue ne peut en aucun cas gagner le pli.
    En cas d'égalité c'est le premier joueur dans l'ordre du tour qui prend le pli.

La manche se termine quand toutes les cartes ont été jouées, chaque joueur fait le total de ses points (qui peut très bien être négatif) et on passe à la manche suivante.

Les variantes
Sticheln inversé
Règle identique, mais ici chaque joueur choisit une couleur porte bonheur où chaque carte gagnée rapporte des points positifs au hauteur de sa valeur.Toutes les autres cartes rapportent -1pt. Dans cette variante les cartes d'atout de valeur 0 sont prises en compte dans l'attribution des plis.

Sticheln mild
Règle identique, mais ici chaque carte dans la couleur maudite rapportent -5 pts quelque soit sa valeur.

Sticheln dans le brouillard
Règle identique, mais ici les joueurs ne dévoilent leur carte maudite qu'à la fin de la manche.

Sticheln aggravé
Règle identique, mais ici les joueurs choisissent deux couleurs maudites.

Sticheln en retard
Règle identique, mais ici les joueurs ne choisissent leur couleur maudite qu'à la fin de la manche. Ils ne peuvent pas choisir une couleur qui n'est pas présente dans leurs plis.

Sticheln Hattrick ( 4 à 7 joueurs)
Ce n'est pas une variante, mais un autre jeu de l'auteur également édité par Amigo sous le nom de Hattrick. L'éditeur a eu la gentillesse de fournir la régle et les quelques cartes manquantes. Vous avez donc deux jeux pour le prix d'un.

De 4 à 6 joueurs, les cartes de 1 à 20 en Bleu, Rouge et Vert sont utilisées. A 7 joueurs, les cartes de 0 à 20 en Bleu, Rouge et Vert sont utilisées. Toutes les cartes sont distribuées en début de manche.

Idée générale : si dans un pli 2 des 3 couleurs ont été jouées, il y a aussi 2 gagnants qui se partagent le pli.

Le premier joueur abat une carte qui impose une couleur du pli, le joueur suivant peut jouer une carte de cette couleur ou bien une carte d'une seconde couleur. Les 2 premières couleurs posées sont les couleurs gagnantes pour le pli. Dès que ces 2 couleurs sont connues les joueurs suivants peuvent par choix ou par nécessité se défausser d'une carte dans la troisième couleur. Le joueur qui a joué la plus forte carte dans la première couleur remporte toutes les cartes de cette couleur. Le gagnant dans la seconde couleur est déterminé de la même manière. Il peut bien sûr n'y avoir qu'une couleur unique dans un pli.

Les joueurs trient leurs cartes gagnées par couleur et les posent faces visibles, ils donc devant eux jusqu'à 3 tas de cartes plus un tas pour leur défausse personnelle. Le premier joueur pour le pli suivant est le joueur qui vient de remporter des cartes avec la carte de valeur la plus élevée. En cas d'égalité, il y a une hiérarchie décroissante des couleurs: Rouge, Bleu et Vert.

Attention ! dans cette variante, la dernière carte en main n'est pas jouée.

A la fin de la manche les joueurs comptent le nombre de cartes qu'ils ont dans chacune des 3 couleurs. Pour chaque carte de la couleur majoritaire ils ont +1 pt, pour chaque carte des deux autres couleurs ils ont -1 pt et pour chaque carte défaussée -2 pts.

Une partie se fait en 5 manches.

Mon opinion

Une fois de plus Amigo réussi à nous étonner avec un jeu de levées qui renouvelle agréablement le genre. Klaus Palesh a concocté un jeu à la fois simple, dynamique, et d'une durée de vie conséquente. Le fait de déclarer ses propres contraintes (comme à Wizard) apporte cette petite touche supplémentaire qui rend le jeu si vivant.

Sticheln c'est d'abord un jeu de mot intraduisible - die Stichen : les plis et sticheln : piquer, mordre - qui illustre bien le coté agressif du jeu; les joueurs sont souvent partagés entre engranger quelques points positifs ou distribuer des points négatifs à un adversaire. Animation garantie autour de la table !

Comme dans tous les jeux de levées ou la totalité des cartes est distribuée dès le début, on s'aperçoit qu'une bonne mémoire est un facteur de réussite déterminant.

On regrettera le design des cartes qui est d'une pauvreté affligeante, d'autant plus que c'est inhabituel de la part de cet éditeur. Mais ce défaut est vite oublié face à l'intérêt du jeu et de ses multiples variantes.

J'aime ce genre de jeu sans prétention, facile à expliquer, comportant de nombreux choix, sans temps mort et qui rassemble tous les publics.

Such a great trick taking game that just mangles every basic tenet of trick taking games.  Trumps are weird, tricks are weird, scoring is weird.  You end up cowering in your chair hoping to not win anything until you can meekly reach out and score 4 points for the round.  Love it.

Players declare which colour suit they are avoiding - any cards taken in this colour count negative the card value. Any other cards taken count as one point each. Any colour other than the led suit is considered a trump, and you don&#039;t have to follow suit! A cerebral game that takes way longer than the 30 minutes it states on the box, mainly due to the time it takes to work out which card to play. Very good.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Because there's no suit-following rule, every play is agonizing.  Lots of subtle trade-offs.  Plays better with 4-5 than with 3, although 3 might work if you remove two suits instead of just one.

RATING: 5
An odd duck of a trick-taking game... any suit other than the lead suit is trump... so keeping a variety of suit allows you follow leads. Generally anyone can hurt anyone, so it's generally about avoiding tricks unless you are late to play and/or know that later players are devoid of cards that can hurt you. Can't decide if it is just needlessly complicateed or if there is a genius game hiding in here, and want to try 4- and 5-player games to find out.

Sticheln is a trick-taking game. Reminiscent of the marvellous Hattrick, you choose a suit that you don't want to win, then try and win as much in the other suits as possible, and as little in the chosen suit as possible. It is a great game and really turns the trick taking genre on its head. Mind you, this is now 20 years old, so I guess it could even be called a 'classic'.

I'm not very good at this game but it is quite the trick-taking game. The whole misery suit mechanism and the way trumps work make this deliciously wicked when it comes to scoring. I think one of the coolest things about this trick-taking game over others is the fact that you don't have to follow suit, leaving you with complete control of what you want to play.  I haven't played many other trick-taking games but I think it's going to be hard to top this one. If you ever get bored of the basic game, there are a number of variants included which you could change use from round-to-round or devote entire games to them. Clearly one of the best things about owning this game is that there are geeklists devoted to the wide variety of good games (not just trick-taking) that can be played using parts of this deck since there are 6 suits inlcuded with Sticheln which mostly range from 0 - 18. This is more than a solid investment.

This is a fairly tasty little card game that fills me with same kind of dread I get when I play hearts, where I feel a panicky need to get rid of all of my high-point cards as quickly as possible and then hope for the best.  I have to admit the strategy of this game is, as yet, opaque to me.  I ought to be able to work it out, but I just can't.

We played with three, which certainly works, but seems like it might be tactically limiting over time, since the hands are usually going to average out fairly similarly and the trick has only one player between the leader and the closer.  It seems like it would be more adventurous with four or more, but I could see that becoming too chaotic and with a lot of downtime as well.  The cards are a little flimsy.

It's a trick-taking game known as "the pain game" because each turn you choose a suit that's bad for you (your pain suit) and any cards you collect in that suit are negative points.

Fun trick taking game.  Have played w/ 3, 6 & 7 people.  Some unique elements - EVERY color other than the leading color is trump.  You want as many cards as possible except for your "pain color."  You get one point for every card but lose face value for your cards in your "pain" color.  Interesting.  I haven't quite got a solid handle on strategy, but we had a fun time with it.  Not sure exactly how much control you have -- I wonder.  But with 5 rounds, I suppose the better player will win.

Ending this card game with negative points is not unusual.  The only card game I have never played where you never have to follow suit, and everything other than the lead suit is trump.

Plays up to 8, a fantastic party game because it can be so funny, almost impossible not to socialize, and has a good deal of strategy.

It is one of the best "screw you" games I know--the pin cushion on the box top is totally appropriate. (Not to be played with sore losers.)

I will try it again with more than 3 players because with just 3 there seemed to be a problem of patterns emerging with 2 players exchanging the hand back and forth.  Anyhow, a nice new look at trick taking games.  Pick a color and then avoid it like the plague.  Hard to get a good grip on this one.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Extremely easy to teach, full of screwage. I wonder how deep the game is...

There's a lot to think about such as trying to affect who leads and who wants to win, holding back cards; there's a decent luck component but also a significant chaos component. I get the feeling that scores even out when everyone knows what they are doing, as players will save others in order to score.

RATING: 7
[Trick-taking card game] [8P:7] Delightful twist on the tired old trick-taking genre. Stich's strength is it can take an amazing 8P and play as well as it does with less. Its heart is the Big Twist - you choose a "color of misery" among the 6 colors/suits, and any card of that suit that you win whacks you with a negative score equal to its FACE VALUE (0 to 20) while any other color card you win gives you a pitiful one point. Take no risks, score a pittance; take large risks, score decently; make a mistake, get whacked for a gazillion negative points. Impressively nasty with the right crowd. Very cool card game for days when you might have up to 8P and want to have a change of pace from Euros or party games. (Recommended by my Geekbuddies) Acquired

Is it even a trick-taking game when you don't have to follow suit? Whatever the answer to that Sticheln is certainly a counterintuitive game with tricks. The rules aren't difficult but I at least still found myself making dumb mistakes and obviously bad moves during the first couple of rounds. The game centers around taking risks and punishing others when they do the same. Quite a delightful little game and likely a safe bet for trick-taking fans with a mean streak.

It is a very interesting game and perhaps I will raise it's ranking afer some more plays.
What disturbs me at this game is that it plays somewhat slowly. Usually at card games make 80-90% of your moves in less than 5 seconds as it is obvious what is the best move. Playing sticheln you have to think about every card carefully before playing because every decision is difficult and important. This makes the game intersting but slows it down very strongly

I tend to like trick-taking games, so this one is no exception. It's funny to watch a game unfold in which tricks ripe for the taking are viewed as hot potatoes that nobody wants to handle. The idea that any card not of the suit that was led is considered trump was a difficult adjustment, as was the concept of not having to follow suit. A very different approach from most trick-taking games I've played. The variant rules sound very entertaining as well. The only good thing I can say about the way I played this game is that I never lost points on any hand. Unfortunately, my conservative play also did not net me a win at the end. Know when to be aggressive and take risks--that's my advice.

RATING: N/A
Turning trick taking games upside down with Sticheln. A trick taking game unlike just about any other. Any suit other than the lead is trump, but you don't have to follow suit. Ever. Also, each player picks a "pain color" which will score negative face value after the hand, while all other cards caught in tricks count as one point. The key is to poison the trick for people downstream of you without making it easy to "stick" you with negative points.

One play with four players, which ended up taking almost two hours. Just flat-out bizarre, frankly. I feel like I  would need about ten more games before I really felt like I knew what I was doing. As it stands now the game seems like a lot of mental effort for a very uncertain outcome, and so I'm wondering if "anti-trick-taking game" is something that sounds a lot cooler than it really is.

Played this after several hours of other trick taking games, so this may not be a fair rating.  Trick taking isn't my favorite mechanic among card games, which as whole aren't my favorite category.  This game was doomed from the start.  ;P  Probably best for trick takers who like lots of back stabbing and take that.  This has more of that than I really care for. 

Probably a great filler or warm up for people who like Diplomacy.

What a vicious little card game this can be. It's trick taking in which you're trying to take everything but a particular color. Unfortunately, every color except what was led counts as trump. This game offers many opportunities to screw your neighbor, but those same opportunities might be better served to help yourself. Very interesting dynamic.

I enjoyed it.  A good player would appear to be able to beat those not so familiar with the game. (Though this didn't happen when our very-Sticheln-experienced friend taught it to a bunch of first-timers)  A "don't get painted" hearts-style game where you pick your own penalty suit. I believe it may be slightly better than hearts though.

My favourite enemy: trick-taking games. First of all, I am not very good at tactics in trick-taking games. Secondly, I don't find figuring out best leads/plays and remembering played cards very interesting so the learning curve at trick-taking games for me is very steep.

Couple the first paragraph with the fact that Sticheln is very unforgiving, it is not winner with me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Interesting pain suit trick taking game. The interesting part is that everything played off-suit is trump making it easier to walk away points, but also easier for other players to sluff off pain points your way (or weasel out of taking pain points for themselves).

RATING: 8
Another awesome and weird trick taking game. I can't get enough of these. Sticheln seems to be one with the possibility of a lot of finesse as well as overt nastiness. One play left me frustrated in an "I gotta figure this thing out" kind of way. 

The second play I lost by one point... a very satisfying game, but sooo mean. This may be the meanest trick-taking game ever. Want to play more!

Production note: These cards are just terrible for colorblind players, with a lot of similar colored suits and no distinguishing symbols. Bummer.

RATING: 5
[Initial Impression: 6]
A trick-taking card game in which each person chooses a "pain" suit - all cards collected in that suit will bring negative points, while all other suits bring positive points.  The twist (which can take a bit of head-wrapping) is that all suits, except the one led on each hand, act as trump.  Playing early in the turn is usually undesirable, as it gives others the opportunity to stick you with your pain cards - and it is almost always better to stick someone else than to take positive-value cards for yourself.  It has an interesting twist, but the novelty wears off fast, and it begins to feel like just another in a long series of games with the mechanic of "some cards are good and some are bad".

First played July 31st, 2007.  This is a quick learn (<5min) and takes about an hour to play.  The strategy is somewhat abstract and you will have to play a few hands to figure out what to do and not to do.  It is enjoyable for those who like trick taking games.  The fact that trump is determined by what is lead is interesting.  Each of the other 5 suits not lead is trump.  The first highest card lead wins.  I'd recommend giving this some gameplay if you enjoy trick taking games.  It does have a good balance of strategy and luck considering what it is.  It also has a take that element that you have to account for as well.

counter-intuitive card game, good

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Comments:
Incredibly counterintuitive, and it's difficult to explain why. The game is delightfully pointy, and you generally only piece together why your hand fell apart after it has done so.

A rather high amount of screwage, but it's balanced nicely. Screwing another player generally involves a certain amount of collusion with others at the table, and it's almost never clear how you should do it. That being said, if people can find an approach to hurt you, they can REALLY hurt you.

I'm by no means an expert, but there seems to be a lot of room to play edge case hands in interesting ways. In general, I haven't managed to grasp strategy so much as I've learned specific tactics that can make up a larger whole. I've also generally only discovered those tactics after being punished in very specific ways, so I can only imagine that all sorts of fun tricks await me once I've been suitably abused.

Three player is a lot of fun, and four is interesting as well. I want to try some of the higher counts to see how it holds up.

Update (17 Mar 17): Played it with five players. The addition of 14s through 12s makes your mistakes a LOT more punishing. I think I still like it with 3 best, but the different counts have some subtleties to them.

Sleeved in FFG Clears.

This is really an innovative little card game.  I wasn't much taken in with non-traditional games like "Mu", but this one was different.  For one, the rules were very easy to digest.  It is not very hard to explain to a complete newbie who has won each trick.  At the same time though, it was practically impossible for any of us newbies to be able to decide what was a good strategy.  

I think the coolest part was: even though you don't have to follow suit, once you've played for awhile, you realize you pretty much have to follow suit most of the time.

The only true downside was the play time.  This just isn't an intuitive game and it is probably not going to take the 30 minutes labeled on the box.

RATING: 1
This is no light filler.  It requires serious concentration.  I feel that it is much easier to lose huge amounts of points than to reach the scoreline of 100 since every game I've played had included only small positive gains each turn.  Even with the suggested 10 rounds I doubt it's possible to reach 100.  The scoring penalises too much and players are often removed from contention in the early game.  Not a favourite.

Surprisingly intriguing little card game.  Non-obvious choices, subtle manoeuvring with your hand, figuring out how to maximize the pain dealt to the opponents cause that I'll be playing this game with pleasure in the future.

The rules are very simple, but it's hard to wrap your head around the strategy.

The added bonus: with 6 colors (each one with values from 0 to 20) you can play TONS of other card games.  Not only traditional ones.

EDIT: The game is too long if played for as many rounds as the rules dictate.

Good trick game all about the screwage. Strategy a little tricky at first but then becomes clearer so not too light or deep somewhere like light midweight. 

A little weak with 4, probably best 5 or 6 players. Love the effect of the zero basically as a ‘pass’ turn card, important to hold these until the right moment.

Bonus - Can play about 40 other games with this deck of cards

Rated after games across 3-6 players. The trump rules really make this game, as they are quite different from other trick-taking games. This is definately a nasty little card game, where you are constantly judging do I take the trick or inflict pain on others.  Very interesting...  The 5-player game definately is more chaotic than a 3-player game, but is still fun.  The 6-player hand was starting to feel too chaotic. Hands take a while to play, so with increased player counts it is hard to have a fully satisfactory lunchtime game.

This game is pure EVIL :devil: Very easy and teachable rules but very hard to master, it is a counter intuitive trick taking game, I have not played a game like this and I really liked it :D  I suspect it will go up in my ratings with more plays, perhaps it could be the best trick taking game, a gamer´s trick taking game if you will :D

It has luck in it (but less luck than most trick taking games out there), but what I really like about the game is that the victor is mostly decided by strategy, not luck.

Sadly most of my fellow players don’t like as much as I do, it is very confrontational and could lead to hurt feelings, try before buy.

I still like this game, still suck at it. I think this game is best with 3 or 4 players as with more players there is more luck, however many friends prefer to play this with a lot of players as the game can be more fun that way. 

I’m getting better, usually I don’t get many negative points, however I don’t get many positive points either so I don’t win but I don’t finish last.

I picked this game up in the hopes of giving us another three player card game besides Setback. I think I was successful in my purchasing because this game changes the way you think about trick taking card games. Since players don't have to follow suit and all suits outside of the suit led are trump you have to constantly evaluate your hand and what to play. An interesting dynamic that will have this game being played for a while.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Sticheln is a game of reverse-trump, where every card not in the lead suit are trump cards. Each player also picks a card out of their hand before starting to determine which suit is their "misery color", in other words the suit that gives them negative points if they win them. As we played through the hand, we had numerous discovery moments about the decisions to be made. Do you use your high cards to win positive points for yourself or lay major negative points on an opponent? How can you securely win tricks without opening the door for a misery card to be laid on you? With the misery color being variable for each player, it forces a careful consideration of every card laid on the table. And the reverse-trump really had an unexpected effect - it gives players MORE control than is usual for a card game because you have a greater range of options for how to play a trick. It struck me that positioning yourself to either go first or last in a trick is key, as it gives you a much greater degree of control over what happens. I think the game is really a fight for controlling as many of the tricks as you can. This is a REALLY cool card game. I think this edges Tichu as my second favorite card game after bridge.

Counterintuitive trick-taking game. It takes some time to get used to not having to follow suit, each card from another suit is trump and avoiding tricks with cards in your chosen color. In Sticheln it doesn't pay to have a hand of high cards only. An average hand could give you the most possibilities. Definitely much opportunity for clever play and I should start counting cards during play.

VERY unintuitive trick-taking ga me.  The rules about trumps are really very simple, but in practice it is very confusing and difficult to initially formulate a strategy.  This is really more of a gamer's trick taking game, mainly because it is so mean.  You are sort of trying to optimize your own performance, but you really just want to hurt the other players.  It's pretty satisfying to unload a big card on an  unsuspecting opponent.  One big problem with this game is the set-up.  Because the cards used differ depending on the number of players, one could potentially always have to sort the cards each time.

RATING: 7
I thought it was going to be a pretty ordinary trick-taking game from reading the rules. But the reality is that it plays very differently from other trick-taking games, in that players are not bound by suits (you can play off-suit anytime). This leads to very interesting decisions during the game, like whether you should screw the next guy, or score points for yourself, or save the card for endgame.

Note: This can be played with any deck from numbers 0-15 and six suits.

Excellent, especially considering the deck can be used to play so many other games! I'm not even a big fan of trick taking games, but Sticheln's may have the best one I've played (the misery suit or whatever it's called is an excellent innovation). Other games are also interesting, like Alice in Wonderland.

A clever trick-taking game. Fun and challenging, but might be sometimes a little bit frustrating too: one round might cost you too much and the rest of the game is ruined - but hey - that's the spirit of the card games. I like Sticheln and the free bonus is, that with its cards you can play Lost Cities, Schotten Totten, Loco! and many many other card games!
Updated 04/2011: After Stich-Meister there isn't actually any (or very little) need to own Sticheln: Stich-Meister is all you need if you ever need to play trick-taking games (well, it's nice to own 4 in 1 -Amigo-pack too). Only reason to own Sticheln could be, that you can play with these cards other small card games, but I don't need that reason, because I own those little card games already...

Another stupid euro card game which is not so bad. I enjoyed playing this game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
My main issue with this game is that if you are dealt a hand with many high cards, you will be suffering penalty points.  I think this luck factor keeps this from being part of the top group of trick-taking games.

An usually trick-taking game that allows you to play any card at any time (following suit is not necessary).  You also have to simultaneously select a Pain suit that gives you negative points equal to the # of that suited card (otherwise, all other suited cards are worth 1 pt per card).  A very tough card game to get acclimated to but the agnst and interaction is very high.

I think this is good with 3 to 4 players.  It plays okay with large #'s but you have to get used to the PAIN and high luck factor and longer duration.

RATING: 4
A play years later (2016) was less than stellar. I just don't think that I really enjoy trick taking card games that don't require one to follow in the suit led. Reduced rating from 7 to 4.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

First play was rather confusing even if it is a simple little card game.  Part of that might be that we were trying to learn the game after midnight AND after an exhausting evening of 6 hours of highly energetic activities with junior highers...At the time, it seemed a bit counter intuitive to the usual card game experience with every card but the color played and zeroes serving as trump...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Unique trick-taking card game in which one tries not to collect cards in his/her "pain" suit while trying to win as many cards in other suits as possible.  I usually don't like "Hearts" style games in which one generally tries to duck winning tricks, but I find myself enjoying this one.

Really interesting reverse thought process to avoid your “pain suit” each round, while at the same time trying to pick up tricks for the other four suits for positive points. Lots of double think going on since you don’t have to follow suit, and you’re hedging your bets about what cards other players may or may not play. (Not to be confused with Stichling, which I didn't like as much as Sticheln.)

Ein Stichspiel!
Nur ganz anders! Es gibt keine Pflicht zu bekennen. Nein, wenn man gar eine andere Farbe spielt gilt diese grundsätzlich als höher als die erste Farbe im Stich. Allerdings will man auch nicht alle Stiche haben, denn am Rundenanfang wählt man selbst eine Farbe, die einem Minuspunkte einbringt und zwar so viel wie deren Zahlenwert anzeigt. Alle anderen Karten bringen mir zwar Pluspunkte, aber nur +1 pro Karte, der Wert ist dabei egal!
Das Spiel spielt sich mal sowas von anders im Vergleich zu den "üblichen" Stichspielen. Man muss teilweise wirklich überlegen mit welcher Karte man raus kommt... nicht dass mir ein Gegner eine fette Minuskarte in meinen Stich haut, was dann aber vielleicht daneben geht, da es eine andere Fabre ist...
Ich finde das Spiel eine echte Überraschung und es hat mir sehr gefallen.

This is the game that helped me realize that trick-taking games could be awesome. While I have cooled on Sticheln a bit since those heady days, I still enjoy playing it on occasion, since the unique puzzles presented by the pain suit are worth the downside that there is virtually no place for aggressive play in the game.

The problem is that any time you stick your neck out to take a trick when there are still players to play after you, you're going to get a pile of pain dumped on you. If you do a passable job of counting cards, you can try winning a trick with a card lower than any of your remaining pain cards, but later players are apt to take it on you. The result is a bit staid and stodgy when the premise promises good, backstabby fun. I keep toying with trying to figure out how to deliver on thsi promise, but it's a tough nut to crack.

By the way, Stich's sweet spot is 4 players, with 5 next best. Four is a little staid, while 4 is almost static, while 5 is a bit out of control, and more is absolute madness. It's a shame there's no way of playing with 4.5 people :)

Although I am personally rating this a 6, the game is actually much better than the rating would suggest.  It is original, with clear and elegant rules.  It is interesting, strategic, and rewards skill.  The only reason for giving it a 6, is that it is a game which can create some bad feelings.  I played it with a couple and with friends, and I noticed how upset they got when playing this game.  The fact that the game requires that you make others lose points makes the game very confrontational and cutthroat.  I would only play it with others who fully embrace this type of game.  When in doubt about the party's enjoyment of "take that" cutthroat games I would shy away from this game and suggest other card games like Tichu instead.

3-8p, 60m. 6-suits (colors), 120 card numbered deck.  Cards go from 0-18 in three colors and 0-20 for the rest. The extra cards are used to play Hattrick (by the same designer--has only 3 suits, numbered 1-20) with rules included in the box in the "new" 2001 edition. The 1993 edition doesn't have the extra cards and maxes out at six players.

We played Sticheln wrong the first time, counting non-pain cards as face value for points (rather than always being one point), but I can't shake the feeling that this still wouldn't be a good game if played right.

I felt like I made zero interesting decisions in 30 minutes, and the overall gameplay experience was thoroughly average. The cards are ugly and boring (and terrible for the color blind) -- Amigo really phoned in my edition. Five hands of 15 tricks seems like way too many; it got boring quick.

Might be worth another play, but my motivation is pretty low.

Sticheln is a very clever twist on the trick-taking genre.  It is one of those games that takes several rounds to get a good feel for.  And you'll need to get a hang of the strategies, because mistakes can be extremely costly.  Unfortunately, the game lasts quite a  bit longer than the advertised time, so it is tough to use it as 'Filler'.

Bring the pain!  Lots of nasty fun.  Takes a few minutes to wrap your head around the rules (although they're quite simple and explained well in the summary).  However, probably takes a considerable amount of hands to formulate a good strategy.  I haven't played much so my strategy is almost purely defensive.  Also, plays 3-8 & players can easily join in after any round.   12-2006

A simple and familiar game with a clever, nasty twist. Tactics are subtle, but can be learned during the first game. Best played with three players - with more, it's more chaotic. The deck is also quite versatile - with it's six suits and lots of cards in them, it can replace many special decks.

Scales well from 3-8 players.  With less players the game is slightly more tactical as you can more readily count the cards.  With more players the nasty side of the game really shines.

And the scoring the totals the value of the cards you ddn't want to take and those are negative points and then you add up the number of cards of other colors that you won you subtract the two and that's your score for the round...

Great trick-taking game with interesting game play. I enjoy these non-traditional type of games that make you think in different ways. Everyone has a "pain color" and hence everyone has slightly different agendas in the game. The game play can be vicious as you always have to consider what the best moves are "now" as well as what to keep for later in the round. 
This is another game that we haven't played enough of to fully realize the mechanisms in the game. It isn't a very deep or complex game but it plays quickly and is one of those games with that nice "twist" in the mechanisms that draws you back to the game.

Trick taking with a few twists. You select a "pain" card, and any cards you take of that suit count negative (the value of the card!), while all other cards are worth 1 pt. Also you do not have to follow suit, and any other suit is trump! Decent trick taking game, works with 6 players as well. I think strategy wise, you have to avoid absorbing big losses in a round and try to get tricks. As trick taking games go I do prefer Gang of Four, Frank'z Zoo, but this one is fun.

A great trick-taking game with a good balance of choice of either maximizing your own points or screwing over the other players. Very good depth to strategies/tactics. You rarely feel out of control once you've got your head around it: Thus experienced trick-taking gamers have an advantage of the non-iniated. Together with Mü & More my favourite trick-taking game. I would not play it with more than 5 players.

A decent three-player game, though I think your cards play a bigger role in how you will do over your skillful play. Color-blindness alert... this game has a few suits that are big-time offenders, especially if you are shade color-blind like me.

Love the twist on traditional trick-taking: every suit other than the one led is trump! And no need to follow suit. What's more, these unintuitive rules work beautifully.

Docking some... (8.5->7) always seems to take so much longer to play than it should, as people get stumped by competing interests and desires. And seating order matters more than it should.

There is control if played with 3 players. I really like how you don't have to follow suit at all and everything except asked suit is trump. Game gets quite chaotic with more players, I prefer to play it with 3 players. Four is also a decent game but already starts to show a bit too much chaos.

A rather chaotic and crazy trick-taking game. There is an element of control, but perhaps not as much as the Sticheln-fanatics would have you believe.

Many games will be lost to first-timer syndrome, which is perhaps its biggest curse.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Sticheln is a pleasantly cruel sister to Spades. A game where you can hang opponents out to dry. It made me giggle.

But the printed deck is impossible for colourblind players. With three players some colours are removed from play, and this makes it possible to play at that number. Otherwise - no good.

If you like Hearts, or better yet Ninety-Nine, and you have normal vision, then try Sticheln.

[b]Sticheln[/b] was sold via auction 10/15/16.

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (6):[/COLOR]

[i]I introduced this to my dad and son (we play a lot of card games together) since a lot of geek buddies recommend Sticheln and it is supposed to be good with three players and it was. The only problem for me was that both my dad and son hated the game, they didn't like how counter intuitive it is compared to other trick taking games [i](in Sticheln the trump suit can change with each card played)[/i]. I thought it would be interesting to keep playing, but I also value the time I have gaming with my dad and son together so for the three us us Sticheln was a miss. It's on the trade pile since I don't really have a group that I could see playing this game with multiple times, this doesn't click with those initial plays.[/i]

RATING: 8
This game has seen a lot of play over the years. It's main feature early was the novelty of stitching people up with high-scoring cards (in a game where low score wins). It features good hand management, and counting cards in your suit is essential to survival. Once everyone was doing this, it became a bit king-makery as people decided what big cards to keep to the last plays, meaning players in those suits could not afford to play to win tricks unless they were the last player. Which turned it into a bit of a lottery. Because the card play is slow - you can play any card, any time, which provides a large number of options - it gradually fell out of my favour, but we none-the-less got a lot of mileage out of it. And still do occasionally for nostalgia plays.

Interesting, but hard for me to grab the strategy when all cards non-suited to the led suit are trump!  Bears more playing....  Gifted SS2009.

RATING: 8
Very unusual card game - but really fun when you get into it.

When you have played a couple of times, you can add added an extra twist in the start so that every one has different trumps. 
"The two or more players have picked the same colour for trump, the player who plays the highest card can keep it and the other/others have to pick another trump. That makes you perhaps not play your lowest trump to be sure to have the trump you want.

RATING: 7
Really good and really painful.

Sometimes, it takes me a hand or two to adjust to the reality of a "pain suit". Trick games are not intuitive at all to me.

A great game. Use a Rage deck if you can't get Sticheln

I've only played with three players and it seems to work with three players. I've heard that this will be quite a mess with larger group. It is a trick-taking game with one colour which provides player with negative points if he/she takes that colour.
There are pretty good possibilities to kick the leader, and that suits fine in the game.

Really an excellent trick-taking game with a better blend of strategy and luck than most trick-taking games, which are skewed more to the luck side of the equation.  I've played with 3, 4, and 6, and though all work well, I like 3 or 4 best, as this is rather "thinky" for a trick-taking game, and with 6 it slows down.  Other than that, game play is still just as good, though.

RATING: 7
Sticheln is one of my favorite non-partnership card games. The beauty of it is that the rules are really simple - you don't even have to follow suit. This means, however, that not only do you have a lot of options, the players playing after you do so as well. They might all play high, or duck, or play a color you don't want. So you could play it safe and avoid negative points, but that means you might have no more than 20 points after four rounds. Meanwhile the person taking all the risks might score +20 three times and -20 once, and still have double your points.

Figuring out when to take risks is hard; and man does it hurt when you get that -20 points in one trick. Sticheln can be mean in that you can stick people with a lot of negative points. And often you have to decide between bad and worse, and you're never safe until you've played your very last hand. You can have some idea of how you're doing, but a large negative score is always a possibility. If that sounds fun and not frustrating to you, and I can't recommend Sticheln enough.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A simple and thoughtful departure from trick taking tradition, in that firstly you select one of your cards, whose colour you wish to avoid taking. Next, the player's lead card can be trumped if another colour is played. Now toss out the rule you don't need to follow suit, and you've got refreshing tactical considerations. Interesting and very funny in an evil way as you give someone an "11" in their face up colour. Best to play with those who cheat in trick taking games i.e. "forget" to follow suit, bring their score down and they may never play with you again.

RATING: 7

Yet another trick taking game, but this one is clever and allows for a good amount of planning and tactical play. Vastly better than the clumsy Four Dragons.

It is a good game and is fun, but beware of the times when you unexpectedly win a big card in your "misery" suit, causing you to painfully moan, "Oh no!"
All suits other than the one led are trumps, and you need to avoid winning cards in one of the suits (your "misery" suit).

For someone who's played a lot of trick-taking games, Sticheln is brilliantly counter-intuitive. I love seeing people's faces when I explain that not only do you not have to follow suit, but every card that doesn't is a trump. It also has one of my favourite characteristics: evil. The game is all about making sure that the pain gets spread around your opponents with as little sticking to you as possible. Joins Die Sieben Siegel in my pantheon of trick-taking nastiness.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a good card game that is fast to play.  You need to play 2 or 3 hands to realise the strategies involved.

It is best as a 4 to 6 player game when players have some idea of how to drop big penalty scores onto others.

Usually played as 3 to 6 player games.

Once played 2 hands as a 9-player game.  (Came joint 1st in the first hand and 2nd in the next hand.  It was a bit slow with 9 players and not so exciting as it can be - due to too many players not knowing how to stitch-up other players.)

Except that you're using cards instead of dice, it's like... "Roll a die, then score that many points, or pick an opponent who loses ten times that many points (and nothing he can do about it)."  If you really want to play this, use an ordinary deck of cards, and adjust the rules slightly to compensate for there being fewer 'suits' (colors) and cards per suit.  You'll get the exact same experience, which in my opinion was not fun.  I don't see the appeal in smashing someone who can't stop you, and getting smashed in ways you can't stop, over and over.

I dislike games with strong "take that" elements. In my experience, they deteriorate into games of bash the leader, where players disregard their own standings to harm the positions of others, with the player who was picked on the least stealing the victory

Sticheln, however, feels different. Nine times out of ten, when someone sticks you with a bevy of negative points, you could have mitigated it through more intelligent hand management.

This game plays tricks with my mind's ability to think of tricks and trick-taking games.  And I love it.

RATING: 5

Take what you've learnt about trick-taking games and throw them out the window, because Sticheln runs completely contrary to your tried-and-true rules of thumb. 

It's almost a mathematical complement of Hearts. Nearly everything you do in Hearts, you do the complete opposite here. Tricks actually count for positive points! Everything is a trump! You can play off-suit whenever you want! Wha...??

I'm interested in this game, because I want to figure it out, but two things make me leery about it: perhaps Sticheln is just reverse / unnecessarily complicated Hearts at its core; and Sticheln [i]heavily[/i] rewards [i]detailed[/i] card-counting (which is really annoying, since there are 5 suits and many numbers). I prefer trick-taking games where you only need to pay attention to the high and/or low cards, not every single number in every single suit.

Better with 4 or 5 players, as there will be more pain suits out there.

Buy a Sticheln deck whenever you see it, because you can play virtually any card game you can think of with it.

[b]Update:[/b] 

Raised rating from 6.5 to 7 after 3rd play. There's a good learning curve to this, unlike most trick-taking games. You can start with counting cards in your pain suit + zeros. Then keep track of which cards in your pain suit have been played. Then repeat with the player to your left. Then the next player. Then for maximum cerebral pain, add more players to the game.

For the last situation, I think it's humanly impossible to keep track of everybody's pain suit. The best you can do is watch your own pain, and be opportunistic with disposing of your closest rivals. Sounds rote and boring, but it's not. People do things you don't expect because you don't know their hands, and there's almost always an important card you missed or counted wrong every hand.

I bought this primarily because it is so different from standard card games.  That is true.  So true, in fact, we were still struggling with the whole all cards not of the lead color are trump (thus no sloughing) right up to the end.  The large penalty for negative cards with small gains for positive cards forces careful play, which, unfortunately, can lead some to take too long.  I still don't have my brain wrapped around it, though my friend Dwight apparently does.  I look forward to playing some more to better refine my playing.

Don't know yet. Certainly the 3 player game with a seasoned card game veteran helped us grasp the basic strategies of the game. Maybe the climbing games spoiled me and I don't find trick taking so exciting or maybe it's too opaque for me. Or maybe I wish it would be either more thinky or more "stupid" (in a good way) - will see.

Nagyon okos alapötletű  ütésszerzős kártyajáték. Mindenki kiválaszt a kör elején egy lapot és az azonos színűket próbálja elkerülni az ütések során. Nagy ötlet a minden szín adu a hívotton kívül dolog is. 3-4-5-en is nagyon jól működik. Talán még hatan is elmegy, többen már hosszú és káoszos is. Az egyszerű szabályok ellenére a játék rendesen gondolkodós, talán ez lehet az egyetlen negatívuma a hossza mellett. Tehát könnyed játékra senki ne számítson, van min gondolkodni.

Really an excellent card game. Nearly everything is trump and you're trying to take tricks, but the really interesting catch is that there a just a few cards that are bad. They're not just a little bad - they are a LOT bad. An entire game worth of play can be knocked out in one fell swoop, and so you're never fully out of it. Great for making sure that everyone is on their toes, and it plays pretty quickly. An excellent filler, and a shame it's a bit hard to find.

one of my favorite trick taking game.  might even be my favorite, aside from bridge.

it turns trick taking inside out, and requires you to think about your cards in a way that no other trick taker does.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Sticheln is a trick-taking game where there's no need to follow suit; every card that doesn't is a trump; taking the lead is generally disadvantageous; and giving someone a trick can be downright nasty. Basically, it's the opposite of everything you know about trick-taking games. For that reason, it doesn't feel like any other trick-talking game. It's actually more of an incentive manipulation game like Modern Art, but more opaque and less forgiving. A single misplayed card can swing the game.

RATING: 7
The game of pain! 

It's another odd trick-taking game! You have to make some tough choices about which color to take as your misery color, and how many negative points to give yourself before even starting the hand! Then there are more tough choices during game play. All cards are trackable (if your memory is good enough; should at least track your misery cards) but you never know exactly which player has them. And while the luck of the deal may help you, your game play is still important: it seems that you can play most hands despite what was dealt (to minimize your negative points, if nothing else).

Fun game; 6-->7.

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
- Customize the deck based on #players (e.g., 3er game: use 5 colors 0-8). 
- Deal out all the cards.
- Each player simultaneously picks one card to reveal = their misery color.
- Left of dealer leads a card; that card color is NOT TRUMP. Every OTHER color IS trump! Everyone must play a card.
... Highest (trump) number wins the hand (if 2 same-number trumps are played, the one played first wins).
... Exception: 0's don't win tricks unless ONLY 0s were played, in which case the first 0 wins.
- At the end of the hand, score your tricks:
... 1 point per non-misery-color card
... each misery color card (INCLUDING your misery card) is worth negative FACE VALUE points!
- After 5 rounds, highest score (or least negative!) wins!

This is probably my favourite trick-taking game with 3. It's also good with 4 or 5, but really shines with 3. Rules are simple, gameplay is nasty. You need to win tricks to score point, but you really have to prevent others from dumping your pain colour on you. The decision which card to play is nearly always hard and interesting. Since you don't need to follow suit, there's always a real choice. Great game in a small package.

Scales fairly well, although I vastly prefer fewer players for increased control--3 players is optimal, but it can make a fun 'party-ish' game with up to 8, just make sure to play for laughs with that many as control is out the window.

This is a BRILLIANT game with 3.  In particular, played with the "intense" variation with 2 pain suits per player, and with zeros not counted as positive points.  Simply fantastic.  We've been playing this every lunch when we have 3 players, which tends to be 2 or 3 times per week, for the past several months.  It has easily replaced Flaschenteufel as the game is much much tighter and controlled with thinky-unobvious plays nearly all the way through the hand.  Unlike Stichlen with more players, actually 'sticking' your opponents with pain cards becomes a controlled environment that you can truly play carefully to your advantage.  In Sticheln with more players sticking players with pain cards is mostly on tactical, opportunity based conditions.  With 3 players taking the lead is EXTREMELY important, equally as, and often more, important than playing last.  It requires decisions sometimes to actually take some significant pain, in order to take the lead--something you never see in the multiplayer, non-intense-variant.

Sticheln is a trick-taking game that turns all the rules of trick-taking on their head.  I liked the game once I was able to unprogram myself from usual trick-taking rules.  The game is playable with a Rage deck (as are many other great games) and the rules are available here on the Geek.  If you like trick-taking games then I recommend you try this one.  It's not the best of the bunch, but it's different and pretty enjoyable.

I'm sure that in this case, the fault is with me rather than with the game. I've played 4 hands now and cannot work out how to gain points.

I've mostly worked out how to not lose points, so a zero is my best possible outcome...

It's relatively clever, but did feel a little random (and massively draw dependant - perhaps more than any other trick taking game I've played), even though one player won every hand...

By the end, I'd resigned myself to my fate and was basically playing randomly.

RATING: 7
If I could rate "Interesting" and "Fun" separately, I would rate 9 Interesting, and 5 Fun. There is so much analysis that goes on, particularly with a larger number of players, that the social atmosphere is virtually non-existent. And it plays slowly, even when every one has played several times before.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Before every round you choose a card. That will be your "bad colour". Every card from that colour (include that chosen before a round)that you take will score minus points for you - minus point for that card amount (a 4 is 4 minus point) . Every card in other colurs that you take is 1 plus point.

So you want to take only tricks without your bad colour. When you are the last player who plays a card, then you control the round - you can choose take the trick, or not. But when you play a card earlier, you must be carefull - other players can play a card in your bad colour and let you take the trick.

This means the strongesr cards are the... lowest. Is better to take no trick, than a tricj with your bad colour.

Interesting, that makes a different feeling than other trick taking games.

In my opinion a game with massive downtime and sluggish gameplay should have an interesting theme and lots of substance; an abstract game without substance should be fast-paced and fun.

As far as trick-taking games are concerned, this mean game is great.  Very simple, with several different approaches to take to play the game.

UPDATE:  Most of us have family members who don't enjoy many of the more highly regarded games on this site.  However, most of those people have played some sort of card game (hearts, spades, pinochle, euchre, whatever).  The rules for Sticheln can be easily explained to people like this--the only problem can be in grasping the whole "every other color than the lead color is trump" concept.  It is a great game to play with a mixed crowd, including parents who don't think they can play these newer games.  When played with extended family, including in-laws, this game can be great, as it does have a sort of mean streak running through it.  Highly recommended, especially if you need something for 8 people to play.

My favorite trick-taking game. Plays quickly and is pretty easy to learn, but can take new players a few rounds to realize how to play it properly. I play it with a Rage deck because an actual Sticheln deck seems hard to find at the moment. The Rage deck works perfectly and a Parade deck would also work great with up to four players.

After everyone has played a few games and is on the same page, this game is a blast.

Sticheln is a 1993 trick-taking game by Klaus Palesch and published by Amigo. Being a big fan of many trick-taking games such as Njet and Was Sticht, I’ve been eager to try out others such as Sticheln and Flaschenteufel. Learning most of these German trick-taking games is easier if you have some familiarity with standard trick-taking games such as Hearts, but it turns out that’s not the case with Sticheln. For instance when I tried to teach Was Sticht to someone who’d never played a trick-taking game before it was a disaster -- reverse trick-taking and secret trumps is not a good way to learn the basic mechanic. Sticheln is such a twist on the genre that it actually seemed to be a hindrance to grasping the game to be familiar with trick-taking games. The simple fact that you don’t have to follow suit is enough to make me have to pause briefly before playing every card, but on top of that the scoring mechanism of losing the face value of cards in one suit and gaining one point for cards in every other suit was also perplexing. I enjoyed the game, but not nearly as much as some other trick-taking games, and I didn’t like the fact that a single bad hand could knock players out of the game. In our six-player game, the two players ultimately contending for the top spot were the two that didn’t get forced into losing one particularly bad trick.

As a fan of trick-taking games, I naturally found Sticheln fascinating. It's completely unlike the traditional trick taking games, including Hearts and Spades, but it calls for the same line of thinking. What really draws me to it is the schadenfreude aspect. Nothing is more exciting than sticking your best buddy with that 18 of his pain suit, watching him get dug deep into the negatives. All harmlessly, of course :-)

Devious trick-taking card game. The goal is similar to "hearts" in that players must avoid taking cards in a suit (their "pain suit") - this suit is selected at the beginning of each hand and cards in this suit are worth negative their face value when collected by that player. Players earn +1 point for each card collected in their non-pain suit. Players never need to follow suit and can trump a trick by playing a suit different than the lead card (the highest, earliest non-lead trump takes the trick). The game scales well by changing the deck composition to accommodate 3 to 8 players.

A wicked little trick-taking game which bewitched me within a single game.It's very hard to anticipate where the game is going to go from trick to trick. The way the rules invert most of the conventions of trick playing games takes some getting used to. Unique in its genre. I keep wanting to try it again. While it's just fine with three and five, I think it's fantastic with four players. Though minimal and themeless, I think Amigo did a good job with this one in terms of production. Cards could have been a little heavier. But who doesn't love those sturdy card boxes that Amigo uses?

Very nice trick-taking game, where you really need to twist your brains in certain mood in order to play well. It is nice, that you can always play any card, so you hardly play wrong. You usually play poorly, but that is a different thing. :) Rated after 8 more or less completed games over the years in different groups.

17 rounds now behind and not much has changed since the previous paragraph. A good training for your brains, just remember that this is an evil game. Not necessarily good with just three, probably best with 5 (or 4 to six)?

Updated after 18th play, more the better. I mean players, now we had 5 or 6 and it felt good.

One round with 4 players, didn't feel that good. Well, we had two newbies there as well. More rounds and probably more players.

A fun trick taking game with a few interesting twists. Pick a color that you don't want to collect and every card other than what was led is a trump card!

This was a cardgame with easy rules but hard to master. 

One of the better cardgames. A filler with an edge.

Problem, no one I know wanted to play this with me.

I love playing this game - it takes all that you know about trick taking games and throws it out the window!

 Trick-taking game wherein the idea is basically that any suit that is not the suit led acts as trump (with ties being broken by who played first), but the catch is that each player has a suit that garners negative rather than positive points, so a trick may actually hurt rather than help... naturally, this creates a game that is more destructive in its focus than constructive, and for those that enjoy that type of thing (myself included) its a gem.

Guess what?  Knowing how to play trick-taking games will serve no purpose in this little ditty, since it breaks all the rules of traditional trick-taking game.  It takes a handful of hands to really get the feel of it, since the trump changes every few seconds.  Very fun, and very evil.  It seems to have more in common with Nicht die Bohne than Spades.

This is a very interesting trick taking game, but it seems to be more luck than skill based. Sure, a good player will make more out of the bad hand than a poor player, but the outcome of a game seems to be way more related to the luck if the draw. And if two players choose the same color as their hate-color, both will have a very hard timje competing against the other player(s).

A truly evil game. You have to be on the ball to end positive. One mistake can cost you any chance of winning. Very popular with my group, who enjoy nothing more than stiching each other up.

Card game where you try to win tricks without taking your pain color.

RATING: 7
A good trick-taking game with some neat twists.  You never have to follow suit, but every card not in the suit led is trump.  It is sure different, but it works great!  Highly recommended for card game fans.  I love that the game starts with every player openly choosing a 'pain suit'.

Rating assumes a single hand of play.  If I'm stuck playing the full 5 hands, as suggested by the rules, my rating drops to -27.

Played several times on BSW (with 3 to 6 players). A clever and seemingly so simple game, which I only appreciated after repeated plays. It is nasty, and requires at least some card counting if you want to do well.

What looks like a sort-of standard trick taking card game, turns out to be quite a brain-burner and a game with a more than pleasant "take that!" factor!

Good quality card game from Amigo.  The cards are as bland as they come, but they're good quality.  The game seems great with 3 players, which seems unusual for a trick taking game.  The idea of leading with any color and all but one color being trump sounds like the rules for a terribly childish game, but it works very well.  Seems perfect for a group that enjoys sticking it to opponents more than helping themselves.

5 after 1 play

While the game mechanic is reasonably interesting, the scoring feels wonky. Players are more likely to try and avoid getting negative points than winning tricks to earn the single point per "non-pain" card, simply because the potential penalty is so high. It feels as if the main point of the game is to avoid getting negative points and trying to sabotage your opponents into getting some.

Wow, what an odd trick taking card game. Deliciously devious, but definitely takes some time and repeat playings to get the feel for the valuation of cards, knowing what suit to select as your penalty suit, and understanding the trump dynamic -- it plays unlike any other trick taking card game I've tried.

RATING: 6.5
Trying to remember the strange rules was definitely an obstacle to let myself enjoy the game.  I'm sure there's strategy to it, but I didn't play enough (only one hand) to witness it for myself.  So it only gets an ok score for the moment.

After 1 Play: I like trick-taking games in general, but often they don't add enough to the basic structure to make them interesting.  This is not one of those games.  It is very different, to the point that I'd bet many first time players have trouble understand the most basic strategy - I know I did.  This is by no means a bad thing, and I'm eager to play this one more.

OK in theory, but unless everyone is of the same caliber, seating plays far too large a role in determining the winner. Just not that fun for me.

Feels nice but I only have two playings, so I am a bit undecided. I like trick taking games, so this might become a hit. I just am not sure if it is all about luck of cards or if there is a skill element too.

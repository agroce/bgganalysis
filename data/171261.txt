I really dislike poker, but this game is great! It's poker that you control, with tough decisions and critical timing.

RATING: 6
Decent. Most players will probably find they like the classic or the regular game more than the other. But each has its own set of positives and negatives. I've found I prefer the classic game with a loose playing table. For the regular game, the special spells are definitely not balanced (especially at lower play counts) and you will need to be careful about what mix is in each game. The rule book should have addressed that in some way. Also, the regular game does provide more of a roller coaster ride, for better or worse. (Magic!) The classic game allows for more control. But does it provide enough to be played over Poker outside the fact of a VP stop point? That'll depend on the group. I've had most success with it if the players are trying to throw curve balls to the communities and pots in an attempt to mess with the other players' plans.

Kind of on the fence with this, reading the rules, looking at the spells, wished there were a special set of spells more suited to two players, cards with pick another player kind of takes the edge of play with 2 players. Not a fan of this over beaten theme even if pasted on. 

Seems like a game where 5 is a sweet spot.

Great little game with tons of strategy and great decisions. It has multiple "modes" depending on whether you want a tighter game or a more loose, crazy game. As a poker player, it was super easy to pick up, but I've seen people who don't play poker take to it immediately also.

RATING: 8.5
This turned out to be super fun. Weird brinksmanship with the Community spaces and jockeying for position, along with the sort of hand management that I love, the extra options with the advanced spell cards... tons of replayability here.

Yes, there's some Texas Hold'Em in there, but it's different enough that you get the thrill of discovering new strategies along with the same excitement of flipping over your 2 cards as your opponent does the same.

Really, really glad I bought this and got it to the table.

RATING: 5
I love variable player power games, but there's a big exception-- "ecosystem" style games where one (or more!) of the powers' most obvious course of action will run roughshod over the game unless actively and consciously countered by other players. It's one thing for some factions to be easier for first-time players than others; that's normal. But if you don't even really get to see how the game works unless people already know how to fill their niche, that's probably a terrible first play and then (for me) no second play.

Hocus caught my eye before I'd played its designer's Cry Havoc (which has the ecosystem problem like whoa) and so I tried it anyway. In my game (Alchemy/Storm/Illusion) it did have that issue. But... it was short enough that I'd try it again? I don't know. I still feel like I can't evaluate it at all beyond saying that if you play against Alchemy, you had better keep them from being sure they're going to win any of the pots.

Neat idea, though, and a lot more trad than I expected. Except for maybe the owls, I'd expect a poker player who didn't know hobby games to pick this up fast.

Poker with a twist.
There are two ways to play, with the "magical" variant being a lot more fun. Basically you're playing poker with multiple sets on the table that you have to build yourself. And with the magical styles you turn the wackiness up to eleven.
A bit intimidating at the beginning of the round though with your hand full of options and you without a clue how to proceed.

[b]Hocus (as in hocus-pocus) cleverly implies a magical surprise, and this game delivers with its take on poker with spells.[/b]
r{[i]Much like rhyming slang, Hocus references the mechanics of traditional poker to produce its own version of Texas Hold'em with a satisfying twist.[/i]}r

SYNOPSIS
Players create their best poker hands to win pots worth points after first being given complete agency to form multiple communities of shared cards, pairs of individual pocket cards and pots of winnable points through alternating card play which includes unique player abilities. Unlike traditional poker, players form two hands of cards to score each round towards winning the available pots. Game play continues until a player accumulates at least 25 points, and then the player with the most points wins.

COMMENTS
The spell casting theme of this game underscores the tricky nature of this apparent poker variant. Obvious differences from traditional poker include having multiple hands to score each round, the shared responsibility in determining not only the pot but also the cards in the community, the opportunity to choose one's own pair of hidden cards, cards worth dual value in either forming poker hands or adding points to a pot, and the unique and thematic powers players use in addition to their basic actions. The game feels both familiar and different to its poker cousin, making it very accessible and yet surprising in how it plays. Also worth noting is that, unlike in traditional poker, players do not wager with personal funds in this game. The object is to score enough points by winning pots, and each players starts a round with the same amount of cards to use in attaining that goal.

PROS+, CONS- & NOTES*
+ Very accessible to poker players, using familiar poker rankings and terminology.
+ Open-ended creation of played cards provides wealth of possibilities each round.
- Names of the suits plus variant rules for Jokers should have been included in the game.
- Special unique abilities (known as advanced spells) include a few sets which appear unbalanced.
- Susceptible to group think as to which hands are preferable for winning pots.
* No folding; all players take turns until round ends.
* The best hand doesn't necessarily win the most points, rewarding clever play.
* Reminiscent of poker but much different in how it's played.

* A special note on the game's art: The mythology Tiffany Turrill created for the characters that represent the suits is fantastic, and the artwork is gorgeous. Her evocatively illustrated characters breath visual life into the game's theme and then fade into the background as simply attractive card art while the mechanics of game play take center stage. 'Tis a bit of a shame, though, as much thought went into crafting these characters. Based on a combination of Norse mythological figures, the artist's own inspiration and traditional Italian tarot suits (swords, batons/wands, coins and cups); the four suits as described by the artist herself follows (with a few notes* from me).

Leshii with Coin
A be-antlered manifestation of the forest, in her cloak of underbrush, calls her raven familiars about her. Bemused, they puzzle over a crudely stamped human coin. Traditional leshii are a male presence, but here I have given him a gender bend for creative purposes.
[i]Pentacles (Diamonds), Fall, Earth, The Physical World[/i]
* Also Leshy or Leshachikha
* For fun I've taken to personally calling the denomination of the coin depicting the wizard as a Vitki after finding this bit of historical detail: Vitki ("wise one", pl. vitkar) is an Old Norse and Icelandic term for "sorcerer".

Owl Wizard with Staff
In a secret library kept as sanctuary within a massive ash tree, a wizened warlock finds himself under threat from without. Laboriously, he holds aloft a gnarled oak stave, croaking the protective words from his prized tome. It has been long since he last faced a challenge.
(Owls fit into any fantasy incarnation and are so evocative of magic. To have all of the suits be essentially human in a loose narrative based on myth didn’t add up. It felt too.. serious somehow. So the obvious solution was a squatty owl man who was also a wizard. It lends a sense of whimsy in a world that could easily slide into bleakness.)
[i]Wands (Clubs), Spring, Fire, Creativity, Action[/i]

Mourning Seawife/Sea Maiden with Chalice/Cup
A sad lost love ghost story - traditional among seafaring peoples the world over. A pale lass offers a blessing to the sea, mourning her lost fisherman husband. She herself is a ghost, a stain of memory caught betwixt land and sea, who wanders the cliffside at dawn.
[i]Cups (Hearts), Summer, Water, Love, Emotion, Empathy[/i]

Eternal Blacksmith with Sword
In the subterranean world of the dead, the Eternal Blacksmith forges sword and shield for the coming apocalypse. Himself melted into the swords he has created, he is kept from truly entering the ranks of the dead by an infernal flaming sword that has been driven through a cursed anvil, and forced through his shattered ribs. Like a Sisyphean marionette, he toils on.

I picked this up after demoing it at a con. It's gorgeous looking.

Gameplay is a little odd. The base game is essentially poker, but unfolds in an interesting way (at least to me, who doesn't play poker). It's okay. The advanced game introduces a bunch of special powers in with some of the cards and while it may be more exciting, it seems like it would also add a bunch of chaos, with cards all moving around and whatnot. That doesn't really appeal to me, and I don't think the basic game excited much of anyone.

The feeling I get playing it is similar to Battle Line & Arboretum: tension in which cards to play and where & quite a bit to think about.  Definitely for people that want a bit of thinky card play.  Lots of potential for my rating to go up.

Update after a few more plays: The spells really drive me crazy and I don't think I have a 'poker' mind.  It has lots of potential, but may not be for me.  I'll give it a few more plays without spells to see if I can find a slot for it in my collection.

This feels a lot like Poker with Wizards, and with that comes all the expected complications.

This game presents a very cool "variation" on Poker introducing asymmetrical player powers called spells.

Each player has 3 Basic Spells that are the same and they can cast them in order to play cards to the different places (Community, Pot or Pockets).
Players also have 3 advanced Spells each that are specific to them and come form a themed deck. These Advanced Spells give players the ability of performing a boosted action, for example Tiago had a spell where he played the card to the Community face-down, so only he knew the suit and number of the card he played... extremely powerful!

I really liked the game, it's very very cool, awesome art and interesting gameplay

Could have been great, but the game is a little more of a slog than it ought to be. Taking actions to play cards into your pockets, the community pools, and the pots feels really tedious, and ultimately it feels like a giant game of chicken for no rhyme or reason. Regular Poker moves along at a faster clip, and is far more interesting. This game seeks to remove randomness from Poker, and it ends up removing the soul of the game instead.

Would rather play Poker Assault, or better yet, regular Poker.

It is poker where you don't completely wait for the luck of the draw, but rather control your destiny mostly, which makes it barely like poker and more like area control since there are three communities. I taught it to my family, 3 of which didn't really know poker, and it took a lot of questions to get going. However, once we did, they seemed to really enjoy it. The one who knew poker picked it up pretty quickly. The art is amazing and I can see this being a "meaty filler" for my game group.

Hocus does for Texas Hold'em what Havoc did with Showdown Poker: Take an excellent game and make it accessible for folks by changing the rules ever so slightly. It's a masters class in subtle design and it's a great start for a new company.

Hocus is a card game that seeks to emulate and expand upon hold-em poker.  Each player is dealt a hand of cards possessing numbers and suits.  During a player's turn, he can play a card either to one of his "pockets" (private cards), one of the three four-card "communities" in the center of the table, or one of the pots associated with the communities.  After the communities are full, players associate their pockets with the communities and make poker hands with them; the highest poker hand gets the points in the pot.  Additionally, the game comes with a number of special ability cards provide reusable rule-breaking powers, such as drawing more cards.  I'm not convinced these special abilities are particularly balanced, and I wish there was a better way to distribute them.  Aside from that, though, I thought the game provided a nice take on the poker mechanic.

Great card game with just enough depth to make it engaging, but also fairly simple to teach. Anybody already familiar with poker will be able to pick up on the game easily, though even a poker veteran will find an enjoyable amount of complexity here. Those unfamiliar with poker may have a slightly harder time in learning the scoring system, but mechanic-wise the game is simple enough.

The only downside is I'm not fully certain how balanced each spell book is. Some of the spell books seems to have spells that are considerably more useful than others, but after several games, I don't think this has been a big issue so far.

2016: Starting out at 8, playing just Hocus classic.  I think this is the version of the game I will end up enjoying the most, because it's symmetric and has a really great classic card game feel with some forward planning and perhaps some unwitting co-operation from your opponents.

Lovely art too!

Will try the advanced version eventually.

b3 g4 g5 t30

Finally played it at lunch - it's solid! Takes a round to figure out the flow of the game but after that everyone was gung-ho on it. This is one of the best poker-variant games I've played, I think. You feel like you have some nice control with the different abilities (spells) but you have to give up cards to community to help make your hand, and to the pot to make the hand actually worth something if you think you're going to win it.

I have no idea what to make of this game after one play.  Does the game really suck, or did the players in the game just have no idea what we were doing? It seems like most of the game is determined by starting hand. I feel like a big flaw in everyone's strategy was not throwing cards into the communities fast enough, which let the player(s) with the best cards in their hand throw in whatever they liked. That would explain the longer-than-expected playing time we experienced, since rounds end after communities are filled.  I want to try this again but I'm scared I'll find nothing else.  I hope that I *will* find more because I like the idea of this game.  My rating will definitely go up or down based on my next play.

I was one of the playtesters.  I gave this a medium weight ranking because the different spellbooks take some time to master, particularly considering the other spellbooks that are active in any one game.  It's basically two-handed Texas Hold 'em (without the betting/antes), but every player has a set of special powers that they need to leverage smartly to have a chance at scoring.

This is a Texas Hold'Em poker variant with player powers.  In this game players take turns playing a card into either one of the communities of 4 cards in the center of the table, one of their pockets of 2 cards in front of them, or a pot by one of the communities which can contain any number of cards.  Each player has their own spells related to a school of magic that gives them additional options when manipulating cards in one of these three areas (four, including their hand).  Players will go around playing a spell or one of the basic actions until all the communities are full and match one of their pockets to a community for the best poker hand and win points based on the pot for that community.

This game is all random chaos.  Everyone is doing so much wacky shit with their cards and moving them all over the place each turn there really is no strategy you can formulate or way to meaningfully interact with another player.  Hands in this game are very difficult to win with flushes and straights as well.  A player would need 3 of the cards in a 4 card community to match their pocket in order to accomplish this and capable players can easily disrupt that before you can make it happen.  There's no meaningful decision making in this game and winning is almost entirely luck, there are much better small card games to play.

Interesting take on Texas Hold'em. With four players we play four rounds and pass the spell cards after each round. Playing into the community early seems to be the dominant strategy so far, which has pushed the rating down a bit, but it still is a fun and fast card game.

So far we've only played this as a 2-player game, but its so good at that count that I can recommend it heartily.  This one feels as rich and rewarding as Biblios while maintaining the same level of simplicity.  Absolutely brilliant.  I can't wait to try this with more people.

Based on playing the newest (as of June 18, 2015) PNP version.

Fun game. My group of experienced gamers had a concern about the balance of some of the powers, though. Some of the powers are very situational and almost useless, but some of the powers (especially the one that lets you play a card to the community face-down) are always good and very powerful.

Everyone still enjoyed the game overall. My rating is tentative and could go up or down with more plays.

Hocus is basically Texes hold 'em sprinkled with some fairy dust.  Real cowboys.... look away. 

The system is simple and allows for rules customization without changing the essence of the game - however.  I find a lot more magic in the real game of poker,  than I do in this implementation. 

If you are going to design a game around a well known classic card game,  you had better make it stand out in some special way.  In my opinion,  this fails to even come close.

I suggest you wave a magic wand over this puppy and wish it to the cornfield.

It definitely has a duelling feel to me, like I am fighting other mages. I like the idea of building the line of cards and then trying to win them with my hole cards. It's a fun challenge. Definitely recommend playing​ this game.

This is based off the latest print and play files the backers (which I'm part of) have access to from kickstarter.

I really love this game. I've been a poker player for most of my life and I feel hocus takes the concepts of poker and makes an excellent game. There is some luck in this game, but also a lot of strategy, depth and excellent interaction with other players.

One of my favorites parts of this game is that you can scale the time a game will take and the complexity of the game as well. This makes introducing the game to non gamers easy by using the basic rules. As they get accustomed to the game you can ramp up the rules by adding  rules allowing the red suits and additional spell books.

I've only played this so far with 2-3 players and it was excellent. I just finished 2 games with 2 players today and had a blast. Very tight gameplay with lots of difficult decisions.

I am concerned that this game might be a little chaotic (especially using advanced spellboooks) with 4 and 5 players. So I might update my rating later on.

This is a really fun variant on poker.  It adds a layer of strategy that does not exist in regular poker.  I tend to get bored with poker since I'm not much of a gambler but this adds enough to it that it makes in very interesting.  The art is great.  I also like that it is somewhat modular in that you can play with just the basic spells, with the advanced ones, with the Owls, etc.  I've come to the realization that Grant's designs fit right into my wheelhouse.  I recommend everyone give this simple but deep design a try.

Really good poker variant with gorgeous art to boot. Didn't think I'd enjoy it too much after reading the rules but it plays very well blending elements of bluffing, push-your-luck and strategy into a tense and fun game.

RATING: N/A
Texas Hold'em card game augmented with spell casting. Deal the cards. Player turns build the four card community rows while deciding which hole cards to put in their pockets. Place secret victory point bets in the pots based on how lucky you feel about taking the hands. Add to this, a set of spell cards from different schools of magic that change things up a bit for an added twist. Spell casting aside, the strategy is quite a bit different than regular Texas hold'em. It is more than just Lady Luck and playing odds as you and the players decide what cards go to the communities while deciding when and which cards to commit to your pockets.  Not to mention the mystery bets and not knowing what you get for winning a hand.

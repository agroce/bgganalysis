First contact 1974 in England when I visited a family there. Used to play it with them and bought it therafter. After back to Germany it got in the corner of "political (in-)correctness", which means that Germans don't like to see playing a game with too much swastikas on it... 
So it started to find itself getting dusted on the shelf... ...and later was donated by my wife without even asking...

Received the 1973 version when it came out. I was into the TV series of the time and loved the game as well. Could drag a bit to begin with so we often doled out the escape pack to get the game going. Well illustrated board and interesting packaging.

Played this years ago.  Once owned it, too.  I wouldn't mind owning a copy now, but my guess is that I'd find that I didn't enjoy it as much now as I did then.  Nostalgia ain't what it used to be!  What I do remember was that it wasn't easy to escape quickly but and that one usually got caught several times before one made it out.  There are so many means of escape that it was just a question of waiting your time, collecting the right cards and maybe waiting for a diversion.

Old, standard dice mechanic of a cat and mouse game. An absolute blast from the past, and still is.

The semi cooperation game that is both a good laugh and tense when you make that run.

Fun till the last dice is rolled. The game length is a small problem and there are possible AP with equally experienced players.

Beer and pretzel game. Still is a great masterpiece.

This is an excellent game that I got to play again recently. As far as I can tell there were 3 releases, correct me if I am wrong. Gibson's first release with wooden pieces and a four part gameboard.Gibson's 2nd release with a more squarer box which had a complete folding board and plastic pieces. Then there was Parker's version, much the same shape box as the second Gibson's release also with folding board 28"x20" and plastic pieces.
Selling on eBay for £15-£20+ depending on condition and version.

RATING: 8.1
Just the fact that the game is strongly based on real events makes this game awesome. However gameplay wise the game lacks some interest for the guardian player: there is very little he can do during the first half of the game. Also the rules are not very clear in some aspects -> homeruling will be a necessity. besides it is not very clear how many pawns need to escape to consider the game a prisoners winning - you need to agree on that beforehand, but this makes difficult to judge if you succeded or not, as there are no "winning standards". Anyway, the thrill you feel when, as prisoner, try to execute the escape plan is amazing :)

I went into this game with low expectations, and got a very pleasant surprise. This was one of the highlights of the convention for me. Andrew Nesbitt hosted this game and graciously played the Germans. We put a 2.5 hour time limit on the game, and started gathering our escape supplies. There quite a few ways to escape from Colditz. There were a few tunneling attempts, and the most brilliant attempt was grabbing the staff car out front and trying to make a break for it. I really enjoyed the cooperative/competitive aspects of this.

The rulebook isn't very clear and there are quite a few things that we've had to patch up ourselves.

Semi-cooperative game in two ways: one player plays against the others, and the others are not a real team, because in the end, only one of them wins... if this is ever possible.  I like the concept of playing against time a lot.  I like the way it is thought what you have to do to escape.  But the cooperation is difficult unless you assume that if somebody escapes everybody wins.  I have only played once, but I really think that if everybody tries to really win, it will be impossible.
I also found a bit unconfortable to move the pawns trhough all these little circles, but the design is quite clear.

[*] Siendo uno de los clásicos indispensables pensé que me iba a encontrar con mecánicas clásicas que a día de hoy siguieran manteniendo el tipo y sobre todo ofrecieran horas y horas de diversión. Me encontré justamente con lo contrario: un juego anticuado y soporífero al que le dedicamos más horas de las soportables en un agónico contrarreloj que resultó agónico por insulso, no por tenso. 

Me alegra haberlo probado, por supuesto, por su valor histórico como juego y por funcionar como testimonio de su diseñador, que fue uno de los pocos aliados capaces de escapar de esta prisión alemana. 

A su favor está el hecho de que viste muy bien la mesa, pero poco más me emocionó de él.

Who knew? This game is really quite a bit of fun. The ONLY drawback is that it can go on for more than a few hours. We've implemented a 2 hour time limit. If, after 2 hours no escape team has escaped 2 prisoners, then the Germans win.

RATING: 9
This game is timeless lots of fun lots of innuendo's when playing certain cards (search the showers anyone?) dress ups local rules close finishes this game has it all.No two games are alike. Our little playing group have added a bit of chrome to enhance the gameplay. Rule 1) A german guard painted grey to represent the Gestapo who can search (safe) blue areas. 2)A machine gun triangle emanating from the main gates. A guard needs to be stationed there and a die rolled one for the outside circles one for the inside. This adds tension and realism as there are lots of guards with very little to do during the game some barely move at all. Thirdly we have added a motorbike with a sidecar for the German to give chase to the staff car two guards are needed to operate it. Feel free to use these add ons

RATING: 7
Different sort of game where the German player uses his pawns to try and ride herd on a bunch of "prisoners." The other players take on a different nationality (colors of pawns) and move about the castle collecting items needed for the escape itself or for getting out of Germany to safety (forged identity papers, disguises, etc.). Everything is driven by the roll of 2D6 (with all that entails). 

Very thematic and colorful, but as a game it loses its novelty after a few playings and can easily become boringly repetitive. Basically a collector's item (original Gibson's edition complete with Swastika) at this stage, or for the nostalia factor.

Un juego sobre escapar de una carcel en la segunda guerra mundial, editado por un tipo que tuvo que escapar de la carcel en la segunda guerra mundial.

Los jugadores pactan las condiciones de victoria. Uno maneja a los guardias y el resto a sus prisioneros. Hay cartas de equipo, de oportunidad/seguridad (para prisioneros y guardias respectivamente), intentonas de fuga a vida o muerte (con eliminación del jugador) y demás..

Es un juego sencillo, de duración pactada, y al alcance de cualquiera. No es sencillo ganar para los prisioneros. Es un buen entretenimiento. Recomendable.

Not great.  Seems to take too long, and in general is very predictable.  The designer is a former P.O.W. who was held at Colditz, which probably has something to do with the fact that the Germans have no explicit way to win.

-traded away for Ultimate Warriorz-

Gibsons version + derrickec's DIY-version

Simple... Old...
But a hell of a game. It is a lot of fun... when you think about the game afterwards.
While the game is in progress the PoWs constantly mumble "How could I ever get out of here?" while the Guard-Player thinks "Oh my... I don't have enough guards. How am I supposed to keep them in?"
I love it.

My only flaw is the stalemate you will reach eventually. You have the prisoners on the nearest legal position to the different exits while the guards try to block several of them with lesser pawns. And there you are trying to roll the gamechanging roll. This can take a while.

A classic - part of the quintessentially british post WWII zeitgeist - the gaming equivalent of the Victor and Commando comics.  Played a lot of this when I was a youngster and mostly enjoyed it too - though, truth be told, it usually went on far too long. I remember it took us a while to figure out the way to win as the prisoners was to have a mass escape and always fun thereafter to see tunels busting open, folk going over the wall and the inevitable dash for the officers' car - great stuff - and then the tension as the guards played out their hand of 'shoot to kill's. Can't imagine that making it into a kids game these days.

A classic from my youth. Still comes out every now and then. This game system can be a little long winded, but the theme is great. Can lead to arguements about who will play the Germans
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A classic game from England that still works pretty well - sort of semi-cooperative/competitive, as one player plays the Guards and tries to prevent the rest of the players from escaping. The only caveat is that if the prisoners are *too* co-operative, the Guard&#039;s life can be awfully dull. The guard player probably should never win, but can certainly have fun playing.

A game from my childhood that fired my imagination at the time but that doesn't really work. The guard has too little to do until there's a mass breakout and then has too few cards to achieve anything. Also he can clearly see PoWs escaping through the tunnels so has no choice but to station guards at the exits hoping he can roll some high numbers so he can shoot the blighters once they emerge.

Can your  Meeples climb, run, dig or just bribe their way out of Colditz Castle and then ... to freedom? 

Terrific fun, especially for the "Camp Kommandant" who can get up from the board, stomp about and shout out ridiculous orders in a silly voice. 

Thank you to Osprey for surely one of the most luxuriant reprints of a board-game ever produced.

It not a bad game, but not much pleasure playing the German.  Unless of course you have the "shoot to kill" card and then your happy to let a prisoner go over the wire!!

RATING: 7
A true original, great atmosphere and game components (especially for the era in which it was manufactured ... ).  Exciting gameplay.  Downtime with inexperienced players can be troublesome.

Also, if playing with a group of Escape Officers who insist on playing cooperatively to the extent that they abuse the rule (10) on the free exchange of Cards, it serves them right that once the German Security Officer is defeated, the Escape Officer holding the cards now has a significant advantage w.r.t. the inevitable individual victory.

RATING: 7
A really, really cool game that unfortunately isn't really all that great if you break it down along mechanical lines.  However, given the game's background and the level of theming it's easy to excuse some of its more egregious faults.  Sure, the Nazis pretty much can't win and there's a weird learning curve due to some pretty nebulous rules that are alternatively too restrictive and too loose but the point is that as an experience COLDITZ is a blast- it's no wonder so many English folks have fond memories of playing it as children.  It's very evocative and pretty detailed for its time, and there are little touches like the ability to steal the staff car and drive out that really sell the concept.  I also really like how the game has a definite narrative, with the prisoners starting out trying to pull together resources to make the escape kits and then making small steps toward the big break.  The production is killer, particularly if you can find one of the ones that has the swastikas slapped all over it.

Skedaddle - Crowhurst Edition.

RATING: 8
This is a surprisingly modern game for a 1973 obscure classic.  Like descent and other games with a complex game master role, you really have to play this with someone who knows what they're doing as the prison guard.  In my case I was lucky enough to play in such a situation and it was excellent.  Among escapees it's very collaborate, with a strong social element where negotiations can be overheard by the prison guard.  There are different stages with different priorities, building from less risk to more. 1- assembling escape kits while the guards stand in doorways, 2- grabbing the riskier escape tools like wire cutters and rope and hiding them while your escapees land in a jail that's been plugged with guards in the hallway.  3- Then, finally you have enough equipment to escape and the guard starts to pull more and more of his soldiers into the guard towers in order to chase you down more quickly in the fields.  Add a catan-esque card draw system every time you roll a 3, 7 or 11 and infinite rerolls for movement whenever you roll doubles, and finally the desperate do or die card which you can't see until you're desperate.  All with a 2 hour time limit which adds tension a bit like curse of the temple.  There are a lot of elements that I've only seen in games released on this side of the millenium.  If you've got the right group make sure to find a copy.

Plays really good 1on1, multiple players as the allies tend to compete instead of collaborate (at least in my experience). Tense and always fun to play, as there are always different paths (pun) to win.

Cooperatiu (aliats) contra 1 jugador (nazi).
És cooperatiu però relativament, perquè si guanyen els aliats, no guanyen tots ells, només els que escapen de Colditz... de manera que hi haurà gent que si veu que no pot escapar, no ajudarà lo suficient... o bé ajudaran sacrificant-se pels demés.

A WWII based game where players play a nationality of prisoners and try to get their pawns out of the castle.  One player is the castle guards who is trying to stop them.  A bit long and it seems there is a chunk of the rules missing, as they are rather contradictory in places.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
The hard map board portrays the ground plan of Colditz castle with its rooms and areas, which served as an maximum security prison for Allied POWs during the WWII.  This is a co-operative multi player game. The 5-page rulebook allow players for a smooth start and easy access to game mechanics. From one part you have the guards (German player) who will try to foresee the POWs actions and bar any plans for escape; from the other hand you have the rest of the players the Allied POWs who through ingenuity, patience and nerve will try to do their out-most and escape. Through a mechanics of moving pawns and game cards, players try to outmaneuver each other or co-operate between them trying to find opportunities and reach their goals. An intriguing boardgame and innovative concept.

Had this as a kid and it's the one childhood boardgame I wish had been kept - so I bought the new edition. There can be little do at times with 2 players, but generally a good historal-nostalgic hour or so of fun.

RATING: 6
So far I've found it very difficult to play as the POWs, but it's a really cool game and very challenging. I was a little squeamish about the concept at first, because in a way it seemed to trivialize a very tragic episode of history, but after reading the history booklet that comes with the game, it seems more like a really unique way of making sure the story is told and for the POWs to have the ultimate victory of their captors.

2015-08-10 : August 2003 – we were expecting some friends to come over that evening for a small BBQ and this game but we had also decided we would go looking for a puppy-dog. Just looking mind you, not buying one. Then we saw this pup who had perfected the art of puppy-eyeing people, but we stood firm, we were not buying a dog right now, we were just looking and would think about it over the weekend.

Besides we had visitors that evening.

But on the way home the “but what if he’s gone after the weekend, he is such a cute dog” argument won, we turned the car around and gave him a new home. It’s the doggie in my avatar. He passed away last month. I miss him.

So we played the game that night and Walter playing the German guards easily beat us - we should have worked together a bit more I guess

It's kind of old already, so people will likely get put off by that, plus the rules aren't really on the light side. There are a lot of ways to escape from Colditz, although some are much easier than others, so you might get slightly screwed by the cards from time to time. The game still makes for a great experience, and it's really immersive.

So close and yet so far.

After the last game of this I am more than a little frustrated, I have my guys in three locations prepared to escape if only I could roll more than 6 on the damnable dice.

Brit Number one was poised in the Orderlies quarters with the Keys to the staff car , all I needed was an 8 and he would be away!

Brits Number 2 and 3 were poised in the dark tunnel under the canteen only requiring a 10 to get them to the barbed wire and then on to feeedom.

Brit number 4 sat patiently in the dentist chair with his 60 foot of rope and wire cutters for a 9 to turn up and allow him his freedom.

I rolled 6 after 6 after 6 with the occasional 4 for good measure.

*Sigh*

Twas great fun tho and the guy with the staff car keys eventually do or die-d right out the front gates

Traded in a math trade (2015) for Wrong Chemistry.

As well as the genuine game, I also have a bootleg edition called The Great Escape. Different box art, crude rules set, no copyright of course, but otherwise an identical game. It just shows how popular this game was in the UK that someone went to the trouble of producing a professional bootleg! Something I've never seen before in gaming.

RATING: 6
Really enjoyed this one, the cat and mouse waiting game of when to make your move, the thrill of getting one of your POWs to escape, the agony of having them caught.

Overall, very thematic, turns move quickly, seems more complicated than it is, although there are a few fiddly rules

Can feel a little long, especially towards the end (even though it isn't since your turn moves fast).  We had a number of turns where we rolled but didn't move since we didn't roll high enough to move into an area where we couldn't get arrested.  While this was my main negative, the theming and overall flow the game more than made up for it.  Also, towards the end, you may know whether or not you're going to succeed or not, so the ending may be rather anticlimactic.

At the very end I was one extra turn away from making it to the car, and the other escapee got two guys over the wall and were running away but the German's played 2 Shoot to Kill cards and rolled just high enough to get both his guys.  Felt very climactic, and even though we didn't win, we enjoyed ourselves.  I even traded away some rope he needed to win, since it felt good to try and help someone beat the Germans.

For the German player, he always kept a couple of guards in the barracks so that he was able to quickly pop up if we made a run for it.

Downgraded to a 6 because I think the German player has a distinct advantage.  Although thematic, I think the other players are just waiting around for much of the game to strike on a high roll.

UPDATE (8/16/2017): Played a second time.  Finally made a run for the Staff Car but was 3 spaces short :)  Good to finally get that card played.  We also opened up 2 tunnels and some POWs made a run for it but one was shot.

Strategy: Overall, I think this is a game where the POWs can't wait around, they need to get moving and take risks right at the start, otherwise there won't be enough time.  They can't be afraid of going into solitary, especially if they won't lose the equipment.  They need to grab equipment right from the getgo.  I waited a while until I could do a big, grab 3 pieces at once, and in the meantime the German player held on to an Appel card and played it at the right moment forcing me to have to redo my work.

I still think the German player is at the advantage since they can just about always teleport to various spawn points that are near the POWs, especially with the Osprey rules that allow the Germans to pop up there and arrest anyone on that spot.

Potential houserules, although the first 2 are allowed by Osprey (https://boardgamegeek.com/article/quote/24161737):
1. Guards cannot end their movement adjacent to one another (https://boardgamegeek.com/article/quote/24024049), this prevents completely sealing off whole areas of the inner courtyard, or preventing anyone from getting out of solitary not being able to make it back to the Appel area.
2. White circles count as walkways and cannot be blocked by guards
3. 2 POWs can use the staff car at one time, could be from different nationalities?
4. Can skip your turn as a POW to get a pawn out of solitary (useful if you rarely roll doubles).

RATING: 9
Deserves a high rank for its authenticity- If you have time read the story of the real guy who designed this game (P.R.Reid)and his escape from Colditz- incredible- and it'll make you want to play the game. Then you'll discover that the slightly laborious pre-gathering of escape kit, and holes in the rules are because this is as much an autobiography as a game- as such it has authenticity you are unlikely to find in many games, and plays pretty well- very exciting when an escape is obviously near. Don't worry about the politically incorrect connotation of someone being th Nazis- scarily enough there'll be one person in your family/friends who's happy with this role....

Escape from Colditz is one of those games suitable for non-gamers that could be "iniciated" in this marvellous hobby. Well, the german player should be an experience player because is the bad guy that fights againts all the other players.

I've discovered this game in the spanisg first edition (NAC old edition with all the nazi symbols hidden in the actual versions) and I felt that was a must have game. 

Easy to learn, fast to play and full of possibilites for both prisioners and guards. Beware, is a long lasting game that must be controlled in that aspect by an agreement on how long will it takes (three or four hours could be fine, even less!).

2017-07 EDIT: I changed this for Arkham Horror the card game. Fortunately, 'cause it was collecting dust on the shelf.
-------
I´m just beginning to play this one, but it seems to have everything to be one of my favorites. Get it and play!

Updated: I think this game deserves a better rating than the one it has here in BBG. Probably a lot of people thinks that this game depends on luck and that its mechanics are very simple, but I have something to say to them: Game experience is very important too and this one, played with the appropiate group, offers a very rich experience due to the high interaction between players, the excitement of playing against time and the adrenaline that all the group feels near the end of the game. A pure thematic game that I specialy recomend to you!
-------
UPDATE: It's really funny played with the appropiate group of people. I'll give this a solid 7, but from now I won't play it with fewer than 4 players (German Officer included).
-------
UPDATE: Downgraded to 6 due to issues that arises with some rules :-(

Only a two player game, I think it might work better with more.  Slightly clunky (due to the old design) yet strangely compelling thematically.  Keeper. (Rating 7.276, Jan 17).

My first game was rather unpleasant. I didn't know what to do and so, I felt really lost. I've already played 2 more times and now I feel a lot more comfortable with the game. Its fixed time limit is great to create anxiety. The rating will rise, I'm sure. Only a black (and unavoidable) spot: it's quite luck dependant.

678/ As I first started to catalog this game for my uses, I was slightly surprised to see two categories, as per BGG: Adventure & World War II. The WWII label was obvious at first glance, but Adventure? Then it dawned: it's not Little Red Riding Hood adventure; it's you and your buddies w/ torches & pitchforks trying to catch Count Dracula in the middle of a dark night, or worse still, you and other survivors trying to escape zombies in a shopping center or an underground catacomb. It can be an adventure or an ADVENTURE; the only limits are in your imagination.

My first 'proper' boardgame.  The one that kindled my passion for our great hobby.  My brother and I were absorbed for many hours pondering ingenious escape plans, or the thwarting of them...and the 'shoot to kill' card?  It could break a man (or a boy at least).  We didn't let a trivial thing like barely comprehensible rules get in the way of a good time.  But they do now.  I wouldn't present this as an option for games night.  It's a game of two halfs.  The first half is quite dull and largely repetitive and the second half is a roll and move luck fest.  It pains me to say this but even a major overhaul of the rules couldn't bring Escape from Colditz back.  Now, a skilled games designer bringing modern sensibilities to bear on this subject matter?  My wallet is open.  I've been tempted to have a go myself.  Maybe when 
I retire?

Réédition luxueuse et streamlinée de Escape From Colditz. Les petites cases, les pions, le déplacement à 2d6, tout cela fait un peu "vieux jeu" mais, en fait, c'est parfaitement adaptée. On a vraiment la pression, le jeu n'est pas facile. C'est un jeu "collaboratif" (et pas "coopératif") : on collabore pour réussir mais un seul joueur peut gagner.
Le matos est MAGNIFIQUE : les pions sont dans une réplique de colis de la Croix Rouge de l'époque, les cartes dans des répliques de paquet des clopes de POW et le jeu rend parfaitement son thème. Un classique dans un écrin top.

Thematically brilliant but so so long. The game even says to set your own time limit and if ANYONE has escaped then the players win, if not the germans (another player). As one-vs-many games go this has a lot of build up and can feel very slow for quite a while. It's hard to really WANT to sit down and play it even though it's quite good.

Hay algo que no funciona en el juego. Las reglas originales lo hacen excesivamente lento, aunque recrean bien la tensión carcelaria y la dificultad de la fuga. Si no se logra en los primeros intentos, puede llegarse a una situación de bloqueo para los prisioneros de guerra.
En la versión en español se modificaron las reglas, pero tampoco terminan de funcionar... En fin, quizás lo mejor sea ojear las variantes propuestas por los aficionados. Tal vez con algunos cambios acertados el juego se vuelva más ágil sin perder por ello ambiente ni tensión.

Played it as a kid.  The best part of the game is the Theme.  My oldest brother used to play the Germans and wear my Dad's old peaked cap.  My other brother and I played as a team against the Germans.  It was almost like my oldest brother was the Game Master.  
Endless hours of fun as a kid.

Seems a little simple now - I haven't got it out to play with since I've bought it.  
But then again I don't have my brothers to play with me either :(

Never play to the end, set an escape limit for the teams.  Once they reach this number within a set time (2 hours or so) they win.  If the German player can hold off the required number of escapes within the time, then they are victorious.  I always play the Germans :).

One of the underrated games on the 'Geek. Maybe it's just sentimentality on my part, this being one of the most important games of my youth, before there were such things as eurogames. But the tension builds as the time ticks by, and the pressure on the Allied side to get their men out.

VERY cool and original theme and I love that in games. 

The game sounds very cool too if not pretty light, might need a houserule or two (or three...)but when the theme and general gist of the game sounds so good it might be worth it, first semi-coop?.  It sounds like playing the German is pretty boring first half of the game, would like to address that somehow mostly. 

Funny thing, just found this now and am currently co-designing a game with a couple shared aspects, might have to read these rules now!

One player plays as the German guard force, the rest try to escape from Colditz castle. German player acts as spoiler and has a greater chance of winning the smaller the number of Allied players, but for a Brit who grew up on WW2 Prisoner of War movies, the colour is fantastic. Played it a lot as a kid, haven't seen it in the shops for a while.

Un juego cooperativo, en el que todos cooperan contra uno.

Si estás del lado de los presos, te lo pasas genial, te montas tu propio Prison Break, haciendo planes con los demás. Ahora bien, como seas el carcelero prepárate para pasar 2 horas más solo que la una, con malas caras por pedir recuento o meter a alguien a la carcel, y suerte si al final no hay ninguna discusión.

Es un juego que creo que está muy descompensado en terminos de diversión (por muy real que quiera ser).

La regla final del "A vida o muerte" le añade una dosis de intensidad para que los presos lo puedan conseguir (aunque es bastante difícil).

Really good and entertaining game!

The tension of the game raises every minute. 

The nazi player must abort all the escape plans of the ally players. Whith many of them, it becomes really difficult. 

The allies must cooperate and help each other but not too much because there is just one winner at this game! The one with more prisioners free!

I've played this game a few times. I see no obvious exploits and it has some great game politics, and some nice mechanics. I loved it each time. It's exceptionally well themed, quite replayable for it's weight (light medium), but could do with a tweak/errata or two. Someday I'll find a genuine seller of it on Ebay or even here! UPDATE: Bought it on Ebay. Played it at Christmas, went down well with the family (though too complex for the simpler minds!). UPDATE: After a play or two more I realise it compares badly with modern fare. A gem of it's time, but aged.

RATING: 4
Found this quite excruciating. Too many spaces on the board, and too much 'slippage' as a pawn can easily shift a few millimetres to one side and suddenly be in a new space, which doesn't mean much at the start of an escape, but all the difference when you're one step from freedom yet one pip short on the dice roll. Stalag 17 minimally usurps it, since it's so much less fiddly and quicker.

Escape from Colditz is one of those games that were ahead of its time. This, joined with its unusual and interesting theme, has managed to build quite a fan base around it. Personally, I do enjoy the game, but I feel it's more clunky that it should.

The premise is simple: a player incarnates the German guards of a nazi prison while the rest control a bunch of prisoners that try to escape. The prisoners try to get items that help them to achieve their goal, such as a rope to climb down the wall or a falsified safe-conduct to avoid authorities. The German player must catch everyone with suspicious items in his possession. If enough prisoners manage to scape, the one who has freed more wins. If not, the German player wins.

The play is fun and challenging, but there isn't much option for clever play or strategy as, for the most part, moves will be kinda obvious. Playing with the Germans leads to a deeper experience, but nothing revolutionary. So, why is it good? Well, the partially cooperative nature of the system allows for the theme to root in deeply, leading to an immersive and fun experience. The problem is that there isn't more about it.

Escape from Colditz is a title solely for those who are interested on the theme and don't mind if it's a bit shallow.

This is a pretty fun game, and although it is definitely a roll and move, that is mitigated buy using your movement over a number of pieces. The early game is definitely kind of slow, as players try to get their escape kit, the German player doesn't have much to do except position pieces waiting for escape attempts.  But the second half of the game is well worth the wait, and gets extremely tense for both sides.  The Do or Die cards are pure genius, and really adds an extra something to the game. Honestly every game should have something that maes players go balls to the wall to win the game, if they don't make it they are out.  The rules could totally use a reworking, and rewrite based on modern standards for rules, which are very ambiguous, at best.

Primero fue la II Guerra Mundial, luego el Mayor P.R. Reid fue enviado preso a Colditz,castillo-prisión alemana de máxima seguridad a ¿prueba? de fugas, después, claro, vinieron las fugas, más tarde acabó la Guerra y el Mayor P.R. Reid escribió un libro con sus vivencias en la prisión alemana. De este libro se adaptó una serie para televisión de la BBC en los años 70, y de ésta surgió la idea de hacer un juego de tablero en los 80 y que a día de hoy es todo un clásico.
Esta es la Historia de este juego veterano, interesante y atípico que conjuga simultáneamente cooperatividad y competitividad: lo primero porque es el deber de unos jugadores colaborar entre ellos en el papel de oficiales de evasión para conseguir tener éxito en su "salida" de Colditz, y lo segundo porque es también el deber de otro jugador el evitar que eso suceda, al encarnar el papel de oficial alemán al cargo de la fortaleza alemana.
Así el juego, emulando el ingenio y sagacidad de aquellos soldados en tiempos de guerra, entra en una partida de ajedrez entre presos y guardias y contra el reloj (hay que poner un tiempo de duración al comienzo de la partida) para ver quién gana la partida, quién consigue la libertad o quién mantiene su prestigio.
Un juego en el que ambas partes en liza usarán todas las armas a su alcance: los presos cuentan con cuerdas, alicates, pases, túneles y toda su astucia para escapar por los diferentes y variadas vías de salida utilizando las más diversas y originales estrategias para despistar y confundir a los guardias alemanes, que a su vez, mediante recuentos, registros, detenciones, e incluso a través  del uso de armas de fuego intentarán poner fin a las esperanzas de libertad de los reos. 
Así por tanto, tenemos un juego abierto (hay un abanico amplio de posibles rutas de fuga), diferente, recomendable y original pero que tiene en su contra su dependencia bastante elevada del azar, y es que la longitud del juego debe mucho a la tirada de dados, de esa tirada que te permita llegar fuera del alcance de los guardias, preparar la fuga(en caso de los presos) o bien sacar ese número exacto que te permita obtener la carta de acción deseada. Una longitud que también se alarga ante la necesidad obligada de conseguir el Kit de fuga por parte de los oficiales de evasión, lo que ralentiza y alarga la duración del juego considerablemente, y es que La fuga de Colditz no es un juego para impacientes; es un juego largo con una duración mínima de unos 120 minutos.
Aún así, sin duda estamos hablando de un juego único (o casi) en el género y que no debe faltar en la ludoteca de cualquier aficionado.

Nota: simplificar la fase de consecución del Kit de fuga o simplemente eliminarla puede ser una opción a aplicar por parte de los jugadores para así dinamizar y reducir la duración de las partidas.

Yes, the rules take a little getting into, but I remember playing this from age 7 and bought it again a few years ago for my children to play.
The map is great, the first edition wooden pieces are great, and the overal feel and historical value is great.
It is nice to discover different ways to escape in the games.
Long game, but great fun, and nice to introduce strategy and co-op play to the youngsters without them realising it.

Purchased for nostalgia reasons.
Lots of fiddly little rules but thematic to deal with the castle environment. Only played 2 player so far but I think with more will be better. quite like the dice mechanism with multiple uses. Sometimes as the german though there isn't really anything to do as you are just trying to react to allied movements or be close enough to an area to do something - the search cards in particular - because they are random have to have carefully positioned guards. the no block rule is a little open to interpretation. Not sure why it is there really as it would be a good tactical ploy.

Different people are imprisoned in the castle and want to escape. The "German" player has to prevent that. Players try to collect the right material and plan the right moment to escape. 

Great game at its time. Because it helps to escape at the same moment at different places in the castle, some coordination between the non-german players is recommended. In that way there is a cooperative element in this game, at a time when cooperative games still had to be invented.

Minus is that the game can go on forever.

Played several times as a teenager.

This game is a lot of fun. It has a unique rhythm to it, where things that feel disastrous -- like spending 10 turns rolling low numbers, but also getting to hold the whole escape team's equipment -- can pay off. Things can turn on a dime, too, thanks to the dice. Our first game featured a memorable moment where the Security Officer shot at one of my escapees, I played the Lucky Talisman, and he rolled low. That escapee then hung out for another 10 turns outside the walls, and eventually escaped with a friend for the win.

The board is glorious -- rich with information, evocative, and easy to understand. The appel area is a bit fiddly, since there are lots of pawns there and it's on a cut, but it's no biggie. The components are excellent, and the presentation (ration boxes, etc.) is great.

It's L O N G game, at least based on one play. We ran 3.5 hours for an escape win. We'd have had another 1-1.5 hours if we'd run out of turns. And that's okay! It was never dull: I felt lots of enjoyable tension throughout, and others said the same. Even slow turns were full of watching, bluffing, guessing, and second-guessing to try and suss out plans.

It has an organic quality to it that I like a lot. We started with fumbling, probing attempts to see what was what, learned some hard lessons, and then mounted a coordinated, multi-pronged "escape offensive" that eventually won the game -- which is what I imagine actually escaping from Colditz might have been like. We also got to use the car, every escape tool, and a tunnel, and someone got shot at; lots of high points.

You play this for the history and subject matter, not the design innovation. Hell it uses a roll to move system . Put on your bad German accent, watch the Great Escape ( that would be a cool variant/reimplementation ) and have some fun with a few friends. They did a really nice job on the new Osprey edition.

An odd game this one but wonderful fun to play if you play in the right spirit.  It's a game to enjoy for what it is.  The interesting part is that all the players ('escapers') play against one German commandant.  Ideally, you need at least 4 players; one for the Commandants and 3 escapers.  5 is the best number I think.  

The idea is for the escapers to collaborate to mislead the Commandant and plot their escapes.  It starts quietly as players acquire the 'escape kit' they need but then builds as the escapers start to make their escape attempts.

You end up with the escapers often leaving the game room to collaborate and plot their tactics.

The rules are insufficient so you across situations not covered and you have to make your own rules.  Also, some rules make the game boring so you change those too.  Once you've played a few times, and adapted the rules, it is great fun, except if you are the commandant, when it can get a little lonely!  The person who plays the commandant should be someone who likes to see others having fun!

Despite all the failings, this is a wonderfully devised game and highly under-rated.

Other have mentioned the dice luck factor, which comes into it at times but adds to the charm in my view.  The commandant certainly needs some luck to pick up the right cards at the right time.

Buy it, stick with it, come up with your own rules, don't take it seriously, and have fun with it.

Wow, had my first play in 28 years the other night.  As a game, it's not that great.  Very hard to keep interest up in the early game for the Nazi player as you watch the POWs traipse around collecting stuff.  the action gets going when they make a break for it.  Open-ended victory conditions and variable playtime.  I think it should be much better with more than two players.  Fun for the nostalgia value, and better than playing something like Monopoly.

RATING: 7
The traditional game. Are you a prisoner or a guard? If a prisoner, try to escape outside the Castle of Colditz. Get ropes, keys, civilian clothes, food, falsificate documents, bribe the guards, make tunnels... If a guard, don't let the prisoners escape. Arrest them when they are next to the Castle or fire to kill if yet outside, call them in the castle for a surprise recount, hear slightly to catch a tunnel in progress, register rooms...
Who will escape first? Americans? British? French? Canadians? Poles? Or will the mighty Germans be able to keep all the prisoners inside? Play the game and you'll see.

This is a really great 'All vs 1' game but really needs the max players to really shine.  Had some great games with all the guys when we were down the coast but it just wasn't going to get to the table at home.

Nothing gets the blood pumping than a time limit and escaping from a Nazi prison!  Winning parameters and a time limit are is at the beginning of the game; one player is chosen to play the guards while all the other players play prisoners trying to obtain all the equipment and cards they need to escape from the infamous Colditz castle. This is somewhat of a co-operative effort as fellow prisoners try to help each other out and pass equipment amongst them, all the while keeping a weary watch for the guards who can make their lives miserable. 

A great cooperation game for groups of 5 or 6. Plus, flexible game times and winning conditions allow you to tailor the game to fit your group. The only downside is that it might be hard to obtain this game since it’s a British game that never got printed here in the U.S. Also, there’s a slight chance of player elimination (if a prisoner decides to play a “Do or Die” card). Other than that, it’s great fun!

Juego que me marcó en mi infancia y al que me encantaba jugar (siempre con los alemanes claro) y al que casi nunca ganaba.
La versión actual es un réplica exacta al de la versión de NAC.Para dos no está mal pero es menos atractivo, con  tres o más jugadores tiene más interés ya que los aliados pueden jugar conjuntamente.
Uno de los aspectos más interesantes es que los jugadores pueden decidir los objetivos de la partida y la duración de la misma.

A fun game in which the tension builds as the game progresses. The early part of the game is mainly just the tedious collection of resources and interference by the German player. The mass breakout phase of the game is hilarious as the allies attempt to stampede out of Colditz.

I havent played this for years, but I still own my copy which is in pretty good condition.

Warning: this 'game' is really only fun if you treat it as a light hearted RPG.  If you do this and get into the theme then you can have a lot of fun.  If you treat it as a game with the intention of actually wanting to 'win' be prepared for an incredibly frustrating experience.

If you own the original 70's edition - The most entertaining part of this 'game' by FAR is reading the instructions booklet.  Someone needs to do this to the playgroup and place extra special emphasis on the ridiculousness of it.

RATING: 7
A true class act in terms of component quality and attention to detail. This is like a Criterion collection edition for boardgames, for that alone it belongs in your collection.

The game itself? Well, its a reasonably clever game based around managing your equipment and avoiding the german player as you make your dash to escape a German prison. It's also a 70's roll-and-mover, a clever and tense one yes, but there's no getting around that if those words are heresy for you.

There's also the fact that the German player is seriously shafted, probably the biggest design flaw in the game is that it's designed to be fun for only the escaping players. They should have added something fun for the guard player to do.

In terms of atmosphere games can't get much better than this  - both board and cards are very detailed, and the information provided still adds up. The play is very elaborate but straightforward, without any procedure that can't be justified by the plot (as for instance digging tunnels). If this isn't enough, playing against the clock and the constant menace of the German officers are enough to keep all players interested. Last but not least, it's one of the few games where cooperation is needed that aren't solitaires in a robe (each player wins on his own).

Nevertheless, the smashing atmosphere can't hide the rather arcane gameplay: key mechanisms are related to dice rolls (help cards, release from prison) and key events (like escaping through a tunnel) are directly connected to drawing ONE certain card. If played with several people these features aren't as evident, but for two players the game can be slowed down quite a lot by stale situations where both players wait for a good roll. In general, as far as the amount of players is concerned, the more the merrier.

I think the map and artwork have held up well and don't feel too dated. But the whole roll and move and pick up and deliver mechanics are just not my thing. Guards in the right places also feel way too overpowered. We only got one escape (via do or die!) out of five in one hour. Feels very hard to win.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A charmingly-nostalgic 2-6 player roll-and-move game that attempts to simulate the harrowing experience of a group of POWs attempting to escape from the titular Castle Colditz.

Although many people may have fond memories of playing this game back in the 70s when it's design must have seemed fresh, invigorating, and innovative, it's mechanics haven't aged well. For example, roll-and-move... Really?!?! And let's not forget how you have to roll doubles to get a POW out of solitary! There are plenty of other example throughout.

If you can stomach a veritable litany of antiquated design elements, there is some fun to be had in this game. Players not willing to look past the thoroughly outdated mechanics may, however, want to stay far away from this game of yore.

The theme of course is wonderful. I've read most of the books and visited the castle. We play with a strict 1 hr timeframe with the Germans given 20 seconds on a stopwatch for their turn (plus another 20 second for card resolution if needed). The game can be a blast this way, everyone rushing to get things done. It gets harder to co-ordinate the perfect mass escape, so the Germans have a shot. There's some other house rules, like being able to manipulate turn order and such. Under these conditions the game take its place in our 5 or 6 player game rotation.

One player plays the Nazi guards while everyone else tries to escape from WWII Germany's most notorious prison camp. I have had a lot of fun playing this game over the years; it is very light-hearted and not especially competitive, as players are generally more concerned about annoying the guards and helping each other escape than winning outright! Vastly improved, in my opinion, by having seen films such as 'The Colditz Story' and 'The Great Escape', as there is a significant (although entirely optional) role-playing element to the game.

So dejgraciaos, si por cuatro duros nos podríais haber puesto miniaturas de plástico de prisioneros aliados y soldados alemanes, que hay a patadas por ahí.

RATING: 5
Kind of a cute little game, but the system can be largely manipulated so that the German player will be pretty bored for an hour and a half.  The escape attempts are exciting, but the first hour and a half can just end up being a slow gathering of equipment that is only interrupted by the occasional, useful card drawn by the German player.  There's build up for the "Escape Officers", but a lot of drudgery and waiting for the German.  I rate it a 5, but I think of it more of a "7" for the escapees and "3" for the Germans.

OWN: 2016 Osprey Games Edition with both revised & original rules.

Now slightly dated roll & move game, but was ahead of it's time & still fairly unique. Very thematic. Cards add unpredictability, flavour & replayability. Lengthy game, really needs at least 3 players (for bluffing/trading/teamwork aspects to work), but can be played with 2.

Variants may improve play with 2 players, eg...
A) Take turns controlling Germans so they move twice per round (use pawn counts for 3 player game)
B) As per A, but split Germans & use spare pawn colour to distinguish. Possibly increase German pawn count from 6 to 8 each, and possibly allow moving other player's Germans at double pip cost.
C) 1 player controls multiple nationalities but sticks to trading rules.

This is a wonderful marriage of mechanics and theme providing escapism. Just wish the gameplay was interesting when it wasn't your turn. 

Recently revisited the Schloss playing the owner's Goosestep variant of playing in 60 mins, within which there is an imposed time limit of 20 secs for the German player. An under-utilized theme which sadly still has last century's gameplay, definitely needs an update as it is still fun when not taken too seriously as well as being tense and atmospheric, being one of the best 'chase' games.

RATING: 7
So many memories of playing this as a kid.  Once I'd seen the board I couldn't wait to play the game; the whole thing looked so intriguing and it was the first board I remember seeing that allowed movement in various directions without following a track.

It was always a problem for the German guard player to find enough to do before the escapers became eligible for arrest; one way we used was (contrary to the rules) to allow the guards to block rooms just to create a bit of early conflict.  In practice, this merely made the games longer as the escaping players were usually obliged to get individual pawns arrested to move a blocking guard.  Nevertheless, the moment of escape was always eagerly anticipated and the game remained a favourite for years.

My love of the game, and certainly the excellent presentation, led to a real interest in the subject: I borrowed Major P R Reid's memoirs 'The Colditz Story' and The Latter Days' from the library at the time and in later years, other accounts of Oflag VIC including one written by a German officer.  I'm not sure that I'll play it again, but I can't imagine ever parting with the game.

I have a soft spot for this game. There aren't that many asymmetrical board games out there and this is a fun one, if not scary especially given its subject matter. It isn't too difficult to learn and the cards especially give some nice spice to the game. Recommended if the subject matter does not put you off.

Nobody really wants to play the Germans. Hence, I developed a system where the German player is now shared like the evil phase in Shadows Over Camelot but with a twist...

.:Best 4:.

My Notes
Rule 1: German player (Non-co-op. lol)

Everyone gets a Oberleutnant, a special Security Officer, and each controls their own, according to the different marking design. For the unmarked Security Officers, they are free to move only for the first player's turn.

Rule 1A: Turns & First Player
To add chaos and to remove downtime, everyone moves simultaneously. Trading cards, it happens during the Security Guard's turn. 

The Security Guard's turn is after moving the POW's. The designated Security Guard is the first player. They may move their own or move the common Security Guard, not owned by others (See Rule Change 1B). The first player is then rotated after each round.

Cards are collected in the common pile until hand limit is reached. Once reached, the Security Guard player may play the card immediately if able or exchange from the pile to play immediately; however, if unable again, the card is discarded. Note that all search cards must be played immediately, no choice, and move nearest Security Officer. 

//Review
The round consist of moving the POW's, simultaneously, and then moving the Security Guards. Each player will be able to manipulate the Security Guard like in Survive: Escape from Atlantis!

Rule 1B: Doubles on Security Guard's turn (Early game)
Ignored until the first escape attempt. Instead, as an option, move a common Security Officer according to only ONE die.

Rule 1C: Escape Attempt
This player is now exempt from playing the Security Officer. The pile of cards now goes into the hand of a designated Security Officer player and may draw up to the max hand limit on their turn.

Rule 2: Abort!
Players are allowed to reverse direction back over walls cliffs, key, and ID only. The player must have enough movement points (MP) from the dice roll to do this.

//REQ
Height   MP
30    =   3
60    =   6

KEY   =   3
ID    =   3

One of my all time favorites.  Great fun for all involved, once the shakey rules are clarified.  We usually lower the time limit to escape, since the Germans have the tougher task.

11-1-16: Just picked this up today at local game store. Am excited to get into this game as it is a reprint of the classic, a classic which I never got around to obtaining much to my chagrin. Understand that there is both original and revised rules, so I can still play the original as intended. A game with a war theme that is not necessarily a war game. Steeped in history and a long successful tradition. Can't wait to table it with some friends.

Hay azar en las tiradas de dados y el las cartas (azar por partida doble), lo que hace que la partida sea bastante aleatoria, estas esperando varios turnos a que te salga una tirada doble para escaparte o que te toque la carta de tunel que te venga bien, etc...
Se puede hacer algo pesado y aburrido si la suerte no te sonrie por este motivo.
Aun asi es un clasico y se le perdonan los fallos. 
Fue el primer juego que me compre, a partir de entonces no he parado.

This game is nowhere near as bad as people sometimes make out. Prisoners must gather resources which are then used to execute an escape. Different prisoners my work togethor to achieve this or block each other, the winner being the one who achieves the most escaped prisoners. Thinking about the core-rules if not for the dice and the game length it is actually quite Eurogame.

--Jan2005-- Works in context.  I play Germans, and my son and his cousins play Allies.  They may 'cheat' - but will lose an escaper to solitary if caught.  And we always play with a time limit:  the game is boring if let go for too long.
--Mar2006-- Downgraded to 4.  Excellent game when I was a teen thirty years ago; it hasn't aged well.
--Feb2007-- Ok; played it with all three of the youngsters (12,7,4) and they had fun.  Maybe it's a bit better than I'd thought.

Works very well with a big group and a timer. If one of the prisoner groups hasn't made it out in 45 minutes then the guards have won. Not only does this timer keep the game moving and exciting, but it also encourages those pesky prisoners to work together and coordinate their escapes. Expect a big bust out with about five minutes to go.

"Старичек", состоящий из характерных механик тех лет. Тут тебе и кинь-двинь, и беготня друг за другом, и сбор предметов. Антураж хорош! Приятно, что с подобным игровым принципом, хоть он и прост, и стар, раньше не сталкивался - в отличии от бесчисленных клонов Клуедо, Скотленд-Ярда или Монополии с Риском. Тут всё по своему. Хорошо играется и вдвоём и большим составом. Пока у нас в партиях преобладает полукооператив - как то не до личных интересов. Убежать из лагеря труднее, чем его охранять.

RATING: 7.5
This is a brilliant old classic which is made all the more interesting by the fact that it was designed by an actual second world war POW who successfully escaped the prison camp of Colditz Castle (a very interesting background story accompanies the rulebook).  It also has a very interesting semi-cooperative element where one player plays the German guards and the others play a team of POWs who are working to escape from the castle, but racing against each other to be the first team to do so.  Depending on the group, the POWs might work together a fair bit, or they might be very competitive.  It makes for an interesting dynamic!  As far as the game play goes, this is definitely a very unique, wonderfully themed, simple to play (despite the less-than-complete rules) and downright fun game.  A couple of minor criticisms would be that the POWs end up spending a fair bit of time towards the latter part of the game waiting for a very good die roll, while the German player has very little to do for the first half of the game, and then a nearly impossible task of stopping all the escapees in the second half (although this could be balanced by shortening the time limit for the POWs).  The game components are basic and functional, but I would love to see a company like Fantasy Flight or Eagle Games take all those pawns and turn them into plastic German guard and multi-national POW figures.  That would be flippin' sweet.  Over all, the game is a simple yet mildly strategic (despite the reliance on good dice rolls) experience game, it has an exciting element of tension in the well-integrated theme, and it brings an interesting player dynamic to the table.  It's definitely one of those games that leaves players discussing the experience for a while afterwards.  Game design: 4/5  Personal enjoyment: 3.5/5  Total: 7.5/10

For those of you interested in WWII Prisoner of War escape attempts, and I know I am, this is the real deal.  The designer, Pat R. Reid, not only made a decent game, he was a POW in Colditz as well.  And wrote a book about it.  The map and gameplay tries to be authentic, but the escape attempts in reality were just over the top and can't ever capture the passion these guys put into trying to escape.  At the time Colditz was liberated, the prisoners had a working lumber shop, a glider capable of holding 2 people, launched via a bathtub filled with concrete that would be dropped onto a lever, and had begun their longest tunnel to date, which originated in the castle's highest tower.  At the time of Reid's book, there were hiding spots for "ghost" prisoners that had still not been discovered by the Germans.

Ha, Ha!

Having not played this for a long time and having just seen Tarrintino's "Inglorious" we just had to get this out.......What a barnstormer of a game!

Worringly, Escape is gaming proof that power corrupts, Oh to be the Germans with the power to "call an appell" and "Shoot to Kill".

Play this with the right people, at least 4, and prepare for a baity, riotus blast from the past. They just don't make em like this anymore.

One player takes the part of the German Guards, whilst the others play "Escape Officers" who are responsible for organizing escape attempts by their team of prisoners. Generally, the winner will be the Escape Officer who achieves the most successful escapes; but it might be the German Forces, if they are able to limit the number of escapes.

A bit slow and the Allies were always being sent back for roll call.  I think it's attaction was there was a lot more scope for choice and it is a lot less linear than most children's games.
I don't want to play it again, but I saw a very good condition copy a few weeks ago with its components in the mock Red Cross parcel.  It was these little touches that give the game a bit of class.  But despite a touch of nostalgia as a game I have to rank it low.

On paper, this game should be crap - fiddly and irrelevant board mechanics, and potentially dull for the Germans.  But what's this?  Oh yeah, it's IMMENSE FUN!  You'll be talking about the 'time you stole the staff car' or 'got busted at the gate' for days.

The new version has a small, but important change where you start the game with a full escape kit.  A beautiful remake of the original.  Also note that the new version does come with the original rules should you wish to play it that way.

:gg: Un clásico de la casa NAC. Estratégico y emocionante, con componentes maravillosos para la época. Puede alargarse demasiado y exige, en mi opinión, al menos 4 jugadores para sacarle el jugo. Con fundas tamaño magic 63x88mm.

Too long for being as light as it is with a lot of roll and move. Like the history in the game. Would be better if streamlined or made less use of Dice.

Gibson UK first edition.  Components are complete and in excellent condition (no wear on the pawns and very minimal wear on the cards).  The box has a couple spots of whitening and some dishing, but is still very solid.

RATING: 6
Very fiddly but an insanely high nostalgia factor. You'll get a fantastic buzz when that plan to sneak under the wire while distracting the guards by stealing the commandant's Volkswagen pays off.

All vs. one WWII sim of the POW’s trying to escape from the hex board layout of the castle-converted-prison.  As an early 1970’s game, you must tolerate the two classic six siders roll and move with bonus on doubles and action cards earned as a consolation for low rolls.  Both aspects add a big luck factor.

The theme wasn't doing anything for me going into this but I actually got into it more than I thought I would. It's all quite simple really but it had a decent amount of tension and the first half of the game was fun even despite the randomness of the dice rolls.
That is one thing about this game that can be annoying. Constantly getting low rolls while another is getting double after double etc. I still don't mind that too much though. 
BUT
At one point the guards had so many in the Commanders office due to being unable to roll ANY doubles making it all a bit silly really.

Another issue was it getting to the point where most had what they needed to finish and a combination of two things happened:
1. it turned into a situation, almost a stalemate, where people just needed the right dice rolls to proceed and we weren't getting them. Then everyone would reset to the middle again and the process would continue. And it went on.
2. a player who was far behind was just deliberately putting their pawns in places preventing people from going where they needed to which exacerbated the number 1 issue.

I still enjoyed that first half but would be reluctant to play again due to the said issues. Maybe house rules would help here.

I can certainly see why this became a classic. There's a lot to do, and a lot of ways to do it. It is somewhat scripted, you have to follow the steps of collecting materials, deciding on escape routes, then executing the escape. No rushing straight over the walls! But that's pretty much the point of the game - it's as much a highly abstracted simulation as just a game.

I've been playing this game for over 15 years now.The best part is that it's never the same game twice.However, it's recommended that you play it with others who are game afficianados, as it's a 1-on-4 (or less) game and novice gamers have issues with the strategy at times.

This was probably my gateway drug. Loved it as a teen, would play it all the time with a friend of mine who was a WWII buff. It had slipped down the stack of games recently due to a lot of new purchases.

I like playing the Germans. And, yes, I like to play them in Memoir '44 too! Fascinating that this might be the only game I own that where one player doesn't have a victory condition (the Germans).

I must also confess to thoroughly enjoying holding onto the "shoot to kill" card, as a POW scampers over walls and through fences, hoping desperately to reach safety - unaware my black pawn has a sniper rifle aimed at his Polish head. Am I sick?
There is an argument to be made against games that are recreations of real events and suffering. The same is often said about videogames. I don't agree with that POV. When I play a WW2 game, I'm not drooling over the idea of killing a real person, or any permutation of that thought, I'm just enjoying a game's theme. That is all. I enjoy WW2 games - that involves death and destruction. Period. Any game wrapped around that theme has to embrace those awful events.

BTW, this is one of the early games that my Dad introduced to me that really fired up my mind on the world of boardgames.
Players form their own strategms for escape, whispering to each other, wary of the commandant's all powerful sentrys.
The early game, while collecting equipment, can become a bit hum-drum, but the actual escapes are bloody heart-pounding!
A true classic.

The game is another Molopoly-like game. Mostly decided on the dice role. It feels diferent, as in reality the game is played one against everyone else. No one wants to be the Germans, so as Dad this ends up being my job. When the kids play by themselves, they like to steal cards, and have "rules" governing this stealing. In many ways it is the experience of play (Magic Realm, Kingmaker) that makes the game fun, rather than the actual game mechanics.

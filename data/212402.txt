Far too much "take that" from lots of fairly broken cards which can ruin any sort of strategy you're trying to employ.  The miniatures are pretty much unnecessary and bloat the price for what probably could have been a $30 card and token game.

Abstract:
Worker placement game in which multiple players can go to the same spot and share the resources. Additionally, each player plays an action card that changes how resources are shared or steal resources.

Pros:
+ Beautiful components (minis, cardboards, artwork, cards)
+ No blocking workers
+ Family-friendly: rules-wise and theme-wise

Cons:
- A lot of take that

Thoughts:
Beautiful family game (except the box cover) with too much take that for my taste.

Can you say B-E-A-UTIFUL? This has got to be the best looking game in my entire collection! The box, artwork, game trayz, cards, miniatures, etc. are all top notch! Many consider this a “family” game, but I really do think it’s so much more. While it is great to play with your spouse and kids it can be equally exciting playing with other adults. The strategy behind moves makes for a tough play depending on who you are playing with! Mechanisms are simple, but strategy and wit are still essential to set yourself up for a win! If you like the idea of a fairytale themed game and a game that is light enough for anyone to play you MUST check out The Grimm Forest! Recommended Players: 3-4.

A great game with a great "fairy tale" theme. I can't think of a much better family, friendly gateway game. Especially if some of the players are a little younger. The game looks magnificent on the table and even in the box. The inserts are magnificent. The miniatures are very detailed. My favorite part is probably the art on the cards. Such beautiful renditions of well know fairy tale characters. The game itself is a basic worker placement, resource conversion game with a little bit of "take that". Definitely some luck involved as some of the friends and fable cards are more helpful than others. If you often play with younger kids or very casual gamers, then this game should be at the top of your wishlist.

Man, I really had high hope for this one. Production quality is second to non. The minis, the game trayz and the art work are what makes this game jump. However, there just really isn't much of a game here. It's a race to see who can build the most houses and the person who can screw over the most players will end up winning the game. I enjoy luck based games however this one really fell flat for me and well below my expectation.

It is hard to pick what to like more about The Grimm Forest, the solid thematic mechanisms, the great graphics and lovely minis or the storage solution that currently has no match and has set the bar very high.... It is very quick and engaging as a 2 player game but I think it will do way better with more players. I acquired this through the KS campaign so unless you did the same you may not get this much fun and quality for only 49 USD.... I'd have no problems paying a bit more for this gem!

Highly recommended!

Wow!  This is a game made by true game lovers. The components are top notch and the box inserts are amazing--and well-thought out.  A space for everything and everything in its place.  I love how you push on the edge of the cards and they pop up for grabbing out of the slots. I really enjoy the art work on this game--each card is a beautiful piece of work in itself.  But the mechanics are the star.  This is a resource management/card management game that is accessible even for young or beginner gamers, but still loads of fun for those with lots of experience.  A game can have a lot of strategy, and even a bit of "gotcha" if you want it, but overall it's a nice friendly game that will leave every player with a smile on their face.  Quality all around.

Review of the Kickstarter Edition:

Played with 4 players.  We all loved the game.  About 30 minutes/player for time. 
 VERY easy to learn.  The Fables and Friends cards add great variety.  You can play as "family friendly" or "cutthroat" as you want and still enjoy.

I have to say that the production value is amazing.  This may be one of the few games I have gotten that OUT OF THE BOX all the pieces are managed without having to buy a 3rd party product because it came with Game Trayz in it.  Miniatures are well done as well.

I'm also pleased that with some scaling this game could be easily adapted to elementary school age children as none of the math has to be more complex than adding to 6.

This is a simple collection game where you are racing to finish your 3 buildings. The neat part is the cards that give you special abilities. The characters are all from Disney movies that most people will be familiar with. There's alot of take take in the game but the game isn't too long and that lots of the take that isn't directly targeted as it is placed at a location.

It would take quite a game to meet the quality of it's production.
Unfortunately, it's not quite there for me.  All of the miniatures are awesome but fail to have the impact functionally as they do visually.  The gameplay is choppy and decision making trivial as luck of the draw, blind worker placement selection, and a hefty amount of card reading break up the fun.  Why they didn't use additional icons on cards that would associate with the timing they are used is beyond me...

While still quite enjoyable I would recommend only to younger gamers or for those who don't mind simpler decision making.

Welcome to The Grimm Forest, where family members of the legendary Three Little Pigs are having an epic house building competition. But this is no ordinary competition as all the most famous Fairy Tale characters will be looking on and occasionally lending a hand.

Who will benefit most from the cunning of Robin Hood, the beauty of Snow White, the bountiful gifts of the Golden Goose or the dark witchcraft of the Evil Queen?

Using only their wits, a handful of sharp steel tools, and a few stacks of resources gathered at great risk from fields, brickyards, and even the dark and deadly Grimm Forest itself, each player must compete to be the first to build 3 Houses and gain the title of Royal Builder.

Players are encouraged to use any of the devious tricks they have read about in the many books of Fables found throughout the land. Some will have their plans wrecked by that villain of old, the Big Bad Wolf, while others will gain bricks, straw, and wood by the cart load.

Who will brave the dangers, avoid foul monsters, and bring home the victory? There is only one way to find out... get ready to venture into ...The Grimm Forest!

Grimm Forest is a 2-4 player strategic game of Hidden Movement, Resource Gathering, and House Building. It is a medium weight game that plays in approximately 45-60 minutes.

During the game, players will play cards secretly to move to various Location boards where they attempt to gather resources. Using their deduction skills and a hand full of Fable cards, players attempt to guess each other's plans and make the most of their actions while disrupting the other player's plans.

After resources are collected during the Gather Phase, players will enter a Building Phase where they can use those resources to build Wood, Straw, or Brick Houses. Whenever a player builds a Wall Section on one of their houses, a helpful Friend from the nearby forest comes to lend a hand. Players may choose to accept the help of that Friend, but occasionally it makes more sense to send that Friend to a different player, sometimes discarding their current Friend in the process.

With 16 unique Fable cards and 12 powerful Friend cards, gathering resources in the Grimm Forest can be a difficult and challenging endeavor.

Work hard, deduce correctly, avoid the treachery of the other builders and the sharp teeth of the lurking monsters, and you just might have a chance!

This is one of the prettiest games I've ever seen.  Seriously, if you're struggling with depression, I would recommend buying it because everything in this game puts a smile on my face.  The gameplay is fine; it's not too taxing, and even though it has a sort of "take that" aspect to it, the adoreableness of everything in the game tends to soften the blow.     If you take your games very seriously, you will probably hate this game.  

I guess my only real complaint is that the game's box is just way too big for what the game is.   If shelf space is at a premium in your collection, it's a bit hard to justify owning this.

A lot of people will like this, but it isn't for me. The take that element is just a bit too high for my liking and the strategic decisions are a bit too lacking. The theme, art and minis are amazing, but I thought it would be too mean and intricate for my kids (8 and 6) and in the end, I was right.

Not a fan of take-that games in general, but this is well thought out and well executed. Need a few more plays, but it will still probably stay at a solid 7 for me.

The components are a massive over-compensation, trying to hide the fact that this is a pretty average game with a generally non-loved mechanic - being that each round, the players secretly choose a location and simultaneously reveal. If you're there alone, take all the location's resources. If you're with others, split the resources. So there's your first dosage of high-end groaner luck. So how do we balance that? We introduce a bunch of take-that cards so the "lucky" ones get hosed. Except the take-that cards are usually based off location anyway, and therefore it's another lottery on who gets hit. It's so much fun when the person coming last get hits again! Ahh, but the components will blind you to all this, and fill your game with fun I'm sure. It's ok for a while, but we've played this game in many guises before.

Lovely game, engaging strategy. Not entirely sure why it’s rated for ages 14+, as  pretty sure younger kids could grasp the gameplay. So long as their reading ability can handle the fable cards, kids would love this.

Love that some of the pigs are female (girls play boardgames too!), and that not all the characters are Caucasian/European. The 
The only criticism is that the Monsters that have miniatures feature/impact the game far too rarely. Especially the Big Bad Wolf. He visited the Three Little Pigs three times in the Fairy Tale, but there are only two cards in the whole fable deck that will summon him and he’ll only affect other players if they happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time when it occurs. So it’s very likely that you’ll play a game through and not have any monsters affect player’s houses.

But aside from that small criticism, this is a lovely game that is fun and entertaining for all ages.

The game is beautiful and has component holders that come out of the box. There are 2 such holders that allow components to be held at both sides of the board. The instructions are easy to follow and the printing clear on the cards. I find 3 or 4 player games the most fun than a 2 player; albeit the 2 player rules does help.

Was lucky enough to see all the miniatures and components at GAMA in Las Vegas this year.  I don't back many Kickstarters, but after seeing how the game play, this has the feel of a instant classic.

Very good family game - plays well with 2, but a bit better with more as more likely to have confrontations.  The insert is amazing, and I wish all games just did a super insert like this (although cost prohibitive, I'm sure).  Awesome awesome!

Kickstarter received.  Played this a bunch of times and the game can be tight at times with a tie for the win and other times no contest.  The Fable cards can really swing things.  I really enjoy the game even though the Fable cards add a luck element.

Definitely benefiting from the KS Hype.  Nothing new here and very chaotic, good theme and components, but highly overproduced.  Would be great for families, but may be too mean and punishing for little ones.

There's no real reason the world should have been given yet another simultaneous-guess-which-stockpile game.  This one is better than most, nicely decorated and with big handfuls of special-powers cards to keep it from being utterly dry.  But even the nicest marshmallow in the bag is still a marshmallow.

The presentation of this game is amazing.  It's fast and easy to learn and has a ton of theme.  Only real complaint is it feels like it ends too soon, but that's ok, best 2 out of 3 works too.

I got to play with a prototype version of this game and was hesitant at first but man was it fun.  Simple, yet challenging and tight game play.  It was close till the end in a 3-player game.  Quite accessible too.

Looking forward to this releasing.

This is a stunning production! And it plays quite well. Clean core concepts that get twisted in all sorts of fun ways by fun characters. Lightweight games hardly ever receive this brilliant level of production and polish. I did not back the Kickstarter but was happy to pick up a Kickstarter copy at my FLGS who was smart enough to get this game in.

RATING: N/A
beautiful family game using all the fairy tale tropes there are
with miniatures!

+ theme
++ amazing component quality (including insert and trays)
+ great artworks (especially on the cards)
+ some cool card mechanics ?
+ fun ?
0 some take that
- relatively light

I would suggest to play this game to enjoy the fairy tale tropes and some of the cool mechanics the cards offer. This game is not made to play competitively.

It's expensive (for a game you probably won't play all the time) but at least it delivers a lot of great quality components.

This is a very light game but we have played 3 times as of this review and we are very pleased.  I have nieces and nephews that are between 8 and 10yrs old and they are having a ball.  They are playing game number 4 as I write this review.  Can't wait to paint the miniatures.  I believe this could easily be a new gateway game.

Probably one of the best family games to ever hit our table! The Grimm Forest is well designed, components are top notch, and the art work is probably the best I've seen for a board game. Even though it was designed as a family game, the Grimm Forest provides enough strategy and immersion that it will be right at home on anyone's gaming table.

Dripping with theme. The miniatures, while almost useless really bring out the best in the game. Has some take that elements, but they also play into the theme. Had a very good time playing. The box says 14+ but this can easily be played by 10 year olds, maybe even younger. Great for families.

A great game for gamers of all types. It's easy to teach, and simple enough that non-seasoned gamers could enjoy, especially with it's familiar theme. But, it also has enough variability with the Friend and Fable cards that it adds complexity and choices not as obvious as the simple rules make it seam. Also, from a production stand point the game is ACES. I mean, from the miniatures, to the artwork to the fantastic inserts, everything about the design of this game is excellent.

This is a gloriously overproduced game.  All the mini's from creatures to houses are very nice and the card art is first rate too.  The game itself seems fine.  Unfortunately while I do like the simultaneous area selection the overall game is quite light and relies too much on take that cards for my tastes.  For all that I'd be happy to play again if offered though I am not interested in getting my own copy.

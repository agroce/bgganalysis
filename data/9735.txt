Petit jeux simple dans lequel deux adversaires pratiquent un duel Ã  l'epee.

Ils s'affrontent en utilisant strategiquement des cartes pour avancer et reculer sur le plateau jusqu'au moment ou il possible de porter un coup fatal Ã  son opposant.

Les cartes peuvent Ãªtre utilisees en combo pour Ã©viter les parades et encourage la stratÃ©gie dans le choix de piger ou dÃ©fausser une carte.

Simple mais efficace.  Ma fille de huit ans adore!

(1 play) I'm rating this as high as I rate En Garde, because you can just play the original game with this set (and the board is nicer than those Abacus cards... though what's with Count Dracula playing pieces?)... but, after only one play, I'm pretty sure I don't care for the "event" cards.  They make play different, but not better, really.  I wouldn't mind playing with them, but given the option, I wouldn't use them.

Game captures the back-and-forth action of a fencing match quite well for a little game.  The addition of the special cards is optional and not required for a positive play experience (the base game is just fine on its own).  [GTI Code: TPCL]

A lowly 4, HOWEVER, with some rule tweaks, is one of my favorite cell phone games in the form of Sumo!  Way too much work and anti-climactic to play right out of the box, but wildly fun and entertaining when automated with the rule tweaks.

Came for free when I paid $25 for the production-quality Puerto Rico expansion tiles. ;-)  I hoped maybe it somehow improved on En Garde.  It doesn't.  Same simple little move back-and-forth game that is completely dependant on luck of the draw and card counting (which isn't hard -- even I can keep track of 25 cards).  The extra "special" cards make the game even worse...play with open hands?! Good God, no!

We play with the Advanced rules from En Garde, which are much more interesting.  You have to manage your hand cards carefully: having duplicate numbers can make you stronger offensively, but having a broader range of numbers can help defensively.  I prefer to play quickly with little card counting, as the theme of the game encourages you to make decisions on the spot.  We get a chuckle out of the hilarious pawns; we call the game "Count Chocula vs. Liberace".

About a dozen plays... Good, quick fun.  My 9-year old friend rates this (Basic game only) a 10. I play it for her, but the basic game I don't care for - pretty much all luck. However, I like the advanced game, which requires meaningful decisions and gives a dueling feel. Also, it's quick. I haven't used the special cards yet. It helps to say "hi-YAH!" when you strike.

Looks extremely simple on the surface, but turns into an interesting (and quick) game of psychology and bluffing pretty quickly. The quick rounds result in a tense atmosphere, since you can't hold the lead for long.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Only played a few times, but the strategy seems to be extremely straight-forward, even with the special cards. Maybe if the deck were bigger, you wouldn't know that it's a guarantee win to attack with a strength of 3 cards. I have to say though, it is awfully fun to have a pair of 1's and run right up to someone, and watch them back themselves all the back to their fence. But really, I think I could write down my complete strategy in a paragraph. Fun with my son though.

Components: Nice sturdy pawns and board. The artwork is well done, with an unusual subdued color scheme. The cards could be of a better quality.

Experience: I'm pleasantly surprised by this one. The mixture of hand-management, bluff, and luck is quite enjoyable. The rounds move along quickly, and players have plenty of opportunity for clever card play.

A remake of En Garde by Abacus.  Nice production values (much better than the 2nd edition from Abacus, but the foam mat from the first edition was nifty!).  The same game, play cards to advance down a linear track, trying to tag your opponent.  Opponents can parry and riposte by matching the attack.  This edition adds eight special cards that change the rules for the current round (open hand, 3 card hand, 10 card hand, beginner chooses, no retreats).  Fine filler.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Duell is nearly perfect in its simplicity.  The game has startling depth for such a simple set of rules and components.  Successful play requires hand management, memory, tactics, and a healthy dose of bluffing.  It manages to invoke the flow of an actual fencing match as well.  The special round cards take the game to a new level, as each changes the rules only slightly, but each also requires you to rethink your strategy.  The parts in the new edition are just the right production value: nice wood bits, attractive board, small box.  Duell is easy to teach, a lot of fun to play, and is surprisingly satisfying.

UPDATE August 2013.  This game is still amazing!  I am very glad to have this edition, as I very much enjoy the "Olympiad" nature of the special cards.

I like this game, it is just too simple to rate higher.  My daughter (4) loves the introductory game.  The main game does offer some interesting choices, attacking with just one card is a big risk.

RATING: 6
Nice (althought somewhat overpriced) game. A typical Knizia game in that it takes an astoundingly simple mechanism and makes some interesting play out of it. 

Artwork is good, and the action cards add a great element to the game. Lose the action cards, and you have En Garde.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2.5
With small decks, the push-pull just wasn't that interesting and the battles really samey.  The game is basically moving a long a dueling track like the warfare track in 7 Wonders: Duel.  There are some more complicated fight starts, but I didn't like the basic game (of cards with varying values 1 through 5) and so didn't like see the point of new restrictions.  The theme didn't work for me at all; I didn't find this to be swashbuckling at all, and without the ability to block (draw dependent), the game was more luck than skill.

There are much better fighting game, from BattleCon to Pandas to VPG's knockout, which scratches pretty much the same itch, but is fighing in a square rather than along a track.

2005-ish: Played 10+ times. It's beautiful to look at with great components and lots of nice touches -- but as a result, it's completely overpriced! What's a gamer to do? Well, if you want a filler game for 2 that somehow manages to feel a LOT like fencing, don't hesitate for a moment -- it's pleasant filler. I just wish it was $5 cheaper.[f]

June 2014: This game still holds up well as quick two-player duelling. Such a simple design does quite a good job of evoking the fencing theme. Bumping rating up to an 8.

Simple but engaging filler that very interestingly recreates the feeling of a a sword duell. You really need to play with the "combined move+attack" rule of En Garde which, for no apparent reason, has been omitted from Duell. Didn't try the event cards, and I dont think they would add anything.

Hmm, I know people like this simplistic little game, but I am just not feeling it.  It's ok, but it really gets old quickly.  Even with the added cards that change the rules of the  duel, this game does nothing for me.  I think Lord of the Rings: The Duel is actually the better game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.5
A card game about sword fighting.
Idea is original but the game itself is not appealing to me for its game mechanics.
You simply keep on shifting your fighter up and down a numbered row and hope to get a card that will eventually allow you to make the move you are looking for.

I wish I could explain why I disliked this game so much. I really had high expectations from it, and it never really felt right. There was a lot of card counting involved, that didn't help things. The basic game is dull, and the meta-rules are a sort of kludge to fix that. Just not a very satisfying game. Even the great Knizia can lay a stinker from time to time, I guess. I traded it away.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A fun-enough light filler, but just barely.

PROS:  When played quickly, it has the rapid back-and-forth feel of a fencing duel.  Short play time.  And, most importantly, the wife liked it.

CONS:  Game-feel is ultimately thin and meatless.  Repetitive.  Card-counting is a pleasureless chore.

BOTTOM LINE:  Try it out if you get a chance—it's kinda neat for a little bit—but don't rush out and buy it.

After a few plays I find that it is imperative that the advanced rules are used, otherwise the game is a pure 'luck fest' and it becomes a little dry.

The advanced game adds just enough spice to make the game very enjoyable... I wouldn't pass up a chance to play.  I like the random card draw at the start of each round... it makes the strategy for each round seem just different enough to keep you on your toes.

Lightweight game that is more fun than it initially appears.  If you don't like bluffing, the appeal might lessen.

The figures are nice.

I seem to be a fan of light card games. Like a good paperback, they are good for filling the small voids in one's life. Duell fits the bill nicely.

RATING: 5
This was a decent little filler type game. Plays very fast and is extremely easy to teach. My only issue with it was that unless you're memorizing cards played and counting cards to determine what your opponent most likely has in their hand, it ends up as a luck of the draw win. Nice for when you don't have much time and want something very light for two players.

Rated after one play.  Not too sure how I feel about it yet.  The cards, when played with the advance-lunge rules, simulate nicely the gross moter movement of actual fencing.  However, I'm not too crazy about how actual swordplay (attack, parry, riposte, etc) is represented.  It seemed simplistic and not very representative of actual fencing. Keep in mind though, that I am an experienced foilist, which sets my expectations for this game particularly high.

Loss of the advanced rules from En Garde is unfortunate, but some of the variations are quite interesting (and incompatible with the advanced rules).  I suggest using advanced rules when X cards come up (but not X x2) and making them an option for the ? card.

Can't believe they didn't include the advanced rules from En Garde.  Without the ability to advance and attack,  my rating drops from 10 to 6, both in terms of play and theme.  Even with the advanced rules, it's not exactly  rocket science.  And let's face it, rocket science ain't all that special... just point it in the right direction, and light the fuse, right?

Looks nice. I used the set to play regular En Garde, though - the special cards didn't seem to make the game any better. The game also lacks the rushing attack, which is a key move I think.

Cute little Kineza.  Should have been re-themed Star wars epic duels.  Just imagine a little mathy sword fight and you have it.  Rules are a bit hazey, but definately play with the parry rules, just rememeber that when you lunge by playing multiple cards of the smae value, you move that value forwards as the attacker, and the parry + a move is the turn of the defender.  took us a bit to figure that one out.  Reccomended.

Distinct disadvantage to going first in this game and, in my limited experience at least, ther seems to be no point in closing within 5 spaces of your opponent. Let him come to you and choose the distance you want to engage.

RATING: 8
A very nice little two-player game that plays quickly and actually seems to feel like a fencing match, at least to me.
  I do not suggest using the advance and attack rule from the earlier 'En Garde' game, at least if using the new action cards. The game is horribly imbalanced if using actions and such cards as 'no retreat' or 'open hands' and frankly it doesn't seem to add that much to the game to me. I like it just fine as published here, action cards and all.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Represents suprisingly well the feel of fencing match (said with some experience of real fencing) Requires thinking, card counting and risk analyzing to beat your opponent. Good and fast game, although one or two "best of five" match is propably enough for single gaming session.

I bought this as a reward for a really intesnse day of house cleaning. (ok, to be fari, my daughter bought it) I wanted Lost Cities, but no one had it and this was cheap, so she got it, albeit a few days after the cleaning. I've played it a number of times with my daughter, but there was nothing in it to make me want to keep playing. I will try again, though, because she liked it. I'll add a rating after a few more plays.

RATING: 7
Clever little card game. Players draw a starting hand of 5 cards from a pool of 25 (5 each of numbers 1-5). Each turn, they play a card to advance or retreat their fencer.

If you land on the exact square your opponent is on, you score a hit. If the draw pile runs out, the most forward player wins the round. First to 5 wins. You can also supplement your hit and prevent a parry by playing multiple identical cards to score a hit. IE: If playing a four to advance score a hit, your opponent could parry if they play a four. You could play 2 x 4 card and the opponent could parry if they had 2 x 4 card.

Simple game where you need to carry a nice range of cards to offer flexibility in the event where you can't move forward and don't want to have to play a high number card to move backwards. 

There are 8 special effect cards which can be used, on per round but I feel they detract from the simple elegance of the base game.

It's kind of neat.  The art isn't all that hot and the Dracula figures really take me out of the game a bit, so the game relies on a great mechanic.  Which just isn't that great.  I'm not a card counter which puts me at an immediate disadvantage right off the bat.  So most of the game is me either getting myself to a point where I can attack with the right cards and to avoid where I can't defend.  While this may be enough for some people it just doesn't work for me.  One of the few games where winning a duel(l) was almost as unsatisfying as losing one.

I was really looking forward to this but was quite disappointed.  Even the 'advanced' game is pretty boring.  I think I wanted En Garde, with the parrying and thrusting and whatnot.  This isn't it.  This is moving back and forth in a track, trying to land on the same space as your opponent by playing number cards (a 4 lets you go forward or backward by 4).

RATING: 6
[Ravensburger 'Duell' 04 edition] {couple; hand management} {Basic 5, Standard 6, Advanced 6} Duell is a rework of the previous "En Garde!" with some new rules.  However, I prefer the original rules when a player can advance and attack.

Duell is a simple hand management game.  It is interactive and thematic. It is fun! It is a very nice filler for a couple.  I don't think luck is very important because the range of card is small and it is easy to track cards and guess which cards an opponent is holding.  I particularly like that a player can take risk and attack his opponent.  It adds excitement!

The new rules increase the game dynamicity.  But, it is not an important enhancement but nice to have.

This game has made me come a full circle back to Knizia's games. I have gone to the deep end of Ameritrash games and enjoyed those dripping-with-theme games with loads of fiddly bits. On the other end of the spectrum are Knizia's creations. Simple, not many rules, almost non-existent themes, but boy, there are just so many subtle layers.
Duell is no exception. A simple hand of cards from 1-5 create so many potential possibilities. I particularly like the rules for En Garde, which are more advanced. These rules allow for more tactical manoeuvrings. Since cards already played are also displayed, one can plan ahead in terms of which cards to play and which to take a risk on. Simply elegant! Each match is short, 10 minutes at most. So, there is no analysis paralysis.
About the only flaw I feel about the game is that duel ends when all the cards are being drawn. I feel this prematurely terminates the game without being able to respond to an attack or counterattack.
I have come a full circle with Knizia. Time to celebrate his greatness in game design!

There's a nice push-and-pull element to the game, which is perfect for the theme.  The game is all about hand management, and the deck is so small -- and the rounds so short -- that any bad luck you get will only be suffered for a short time.  Pretty good, for such a simple design.

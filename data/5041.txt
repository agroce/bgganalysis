Like MBT I still play this. Slightly higher rating than MBT because the pro-American bias is absent

Good post-WWII tactical system.  Not as complex as it first seems, but the rulebook and plethora of charts are imposing.  Artillery system is quite nice, and the optional command rules are nifty.  Not everything works, and the doctrine system in particular ought to be reworked.  It's also crying out for some form of concealment or dummies.  These are pretty easily added through house rules.

Overall, this is some eminently playable fun.

Probably a bit better than MBT for historical scenarios and closer matchups.

This and MBT are great games.  The rule set is more detailed and dare I say complicated than the PL/PB/AIW rule set. You are afforded much more control over individual units, and this can make play more intersting, but be prepared for a little homework if you want to play against good players on Vassal.

687- Arab-Israeli Wars (1967 & 1967), 4 map panels allow endless scenarios.

Rules-heavy, but a good package. Must play this again, having just acquired MBT.

RATING: 6
Enjoyable. However the amount of "house rules" needed here are unwarranted simply due to the designers previous endeavors. 

Feels like a "dumbed down" version of Panzer Armor or 88.

RATING: 8
Another research effort as in MBT. The essence of the game remains unchanged and it comes with historical scenarios.
Rating raised after a re-visit.

Tired of WWIII? How about some good old-fashioned Middle Eastern conflict? This might be for you...

RATING: 7
Better than 'MBT' for its solid historicity. And in scenarios vs. Jordanian forces, you can try the system without artificial doctrine rules. Also, well researched historical scenarios are a plus.

I bought this game because it uses the same system as [gameid=3710] and to compare it to [gameid=3218], [gameid=5965], and [gameid=17237].  Currently unplayed.

Like MBT, this is a tactical game with clunky mechanics. The various subsystems do not integrate well. I only gave it a '5' because I like the period.

Bought yet another copy Sep 2015!  My 3rd or 4th copy of IDF over the years... have lost count.

----------------------------------------------------------

Sold yet again (Jun 2010).  

Still have MBT, but have a feeling I'll never get around to playing it.  Too many other tactical games ahead of it in the playing queue.

----------------------------------------------------------

Bought, sold, rebought.  Have always been interested in the Mid-East Wars.  This is probably the definitive, Mid-East, tactical ground game.

If you're only going to try this [b]or[/b] MBT, pick this one - the units are more well matched than in MBT.  See my comments on MBT for more info on this game system - as reported elsewhere, this is a really good game that's gotten somewhat short shrift among many tactical level gamers.

I've only browsed it, but it looks dauntingly complex. Overall, I think that Avalon Hills Arab-Israeli Wars is a better "game"--though IDF is much more detailed.

Excellent sister game to MBT, but based on the Israeli Arab wars.  Great tactical combat games.

Heavy hex and chit wargame. Probably unlikely to ever get played again but definitely keeping it as it's well out of print and (like all my old AH hex and chit games) has sentimental value

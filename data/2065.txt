Weird Japanese Chess variant. Give this a try if you like chess and want to try something really different yet similar.

RATING: 5
I wouldn't even consider this a chess variant -- it's far more complex than XiangQi or chess, and not entirely in a good way. The learning curve is steep, even just for the pieces, as all but the jewelled general and gold general have a promoted form which may or may not look anything like the original piece. And then the drops! Things certainly don't wind down in the endgame, as they do in chess.

There's a lot to this game, certainly not a bad thing, but I get more than enough out of chess and xiangqi. If I can get someone to teach me this one, I may have to rate it higher.

Although most books claimed Shogi is descended from Xianqi, I couldn&#039;t see the game in any way similar to Chinese chess. It&#039;s semblance to the Indian &quot;line&quot; (e.g. Chess), however, is unmistakable. The lack of ranged attacking pieces (save for 4) sometimes make the board too cluttered since you&#039;ll have to move the pieces for &quot;hand-to-hand combat&quot;, however it makes the game more intense than Xiangqi and Chess.

This is an excellent game! I can sympathize with people who say this game is better than chess. The drops and promotions add a lot of flavor that western chess lacks, and it also add lots of strategy. However, if you are from the West like me, you may want to buy the international version from the nekomado online shop, because they have the nicest westernized set for sale of any store I've come across,  which will make the game more fun (playing with nicer pieces), and easier to get non-Japanese speaking people to try the game and play with you.

RATING: N/A
Awesome Game!  Shogi is very similar to Chess, but takes longer to play.  It feels sort of like a 2-player version of Bughouse.  This game probably has as much depth as Chess.  If you are curious about Chess, but are turned off by the amount of "study" required to play well, you may consider Shogi a perfect alternative, since most people in the U.S. have not memorized the openings, endgames, etc.

Japanese script on the pieces held me back a bit in picking it up but I am currently "cheating" and using western piece identifiers  and the game really shines.  Only played against AI but loving it and slowly getting to grips with the tactics and strategy.  It feels more tense than chess sometimes does in that it can feel slow but then suddenly there is a piece placement or a piece exchange leading to a piece placement and then all hell breaks loose.  I love Bughouse Chess but it needs to be played with clocks and is more of a fun distraction from Chess.  This uses the placing of captured pieces but makes a deeply satisfying game out of it and one when ever I have an opponent willing and the brain power and nerves to go with it I will love to play.

One of the three GREATs along with Go and Chess.
Sets are made for young children in Japan and they have the moves on top of the pieces.
In the west good game shops have the Japanese toddler sets and western made sets with just the moves of the marked on them (I bought one in Vancouver).
But learn the Kanji and you can get a beautiful and cheap hand painted set. The King has the tiger forehead on it. The Knight has 4 legs. The pawns are smaller pieces. The Super Rook and Super Bishop are bigger. Learn the difference between gold and silver and there is only few more to learn. The promoted sides are all Gold Generals so it does not matter if you know the Kanji. Wikipaedia has a very clear instruction.
A good game to bring out if your friend will not play Chess with you because of your skill.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Everyone ought to try this at one time or another. Similar to chess but the pieces move differently and captured pieces can be returned to the board on your side. Unlike chess the action seems to move in waves with the attacker expending pieces to degrade the defender's 'castle' until the king can be exposed and checkmated. As the attacker runs out of resources the defender can launch an attack of his own. Very satisfying.

Played the 9x9 version and was surprised at how much fun I had. Afterwards, I had thoughts of exploring this, go, and maybe even Navia Drapt (sic?). The hook in my case was that the pieces showed their names and moves on the tile. A worthy exercise for regular chess players.

Amazing game.  Although a relative of western chess, Shogi is quite a different game.  Castling, promotions, board space and parachuting of capture pieces, means that the strategy and play of this game is very different.  I find it a lot more fun. Tactics are extremely important and the game play is much slower than in chess. You really feel that you have an army and have to build a real defense.  The pieces take a bit of getting used to, but in reality you only have to learn 8 characters.... not really all that difficult. Not to mention the game looks really cool ;)

It is a shame that this game isn't well known outside of Japan, though there are a few associations and tournaments in most countries.

This is one that I've only played a few times, but would really like to play more often. There is great depth of play. When playing with my wife, I find that I'm pretty good at capturing pieces, but that I am not very effective at dropping in-hand pieces. Other Shogi variants that I keep track of with plays here because there are no BGG entries for them individually: Nana Shogi, Flip Shogi, Whale Shogi.

RATING: 10
Also known as Japanese Chess, I think it is the most brilliant Chess variant in existence. A raw attacking game which is not only a war game like Chess, but a race game in the sense that the game is never simplified to an endgame because the pieces recycle (by being "dropped" after capture), and the game goes on until capture of the King (Oushou/Gyokushou) is inevitable.

Draws are EXTREMELY rare (1-2%), and in professional play drawn games are simply annulled and replayed. Almost all pieces can gain moves by promoting in the opponent's camp. Very deep and enjoyable!

The game is played by perhaps 20 million in Japan. Professional earnings are considerable, with title matches sponsored by newspapers and the like. Some very exquisite sets exist as well, made from kaya or katsura wood. The last two facts apply for Go as well.

I've found Shogi to be vastly more interesting than European chess, as the board is much larger - both through simple size and because the pieces don't move as far as in chess.  As a result, the game is very strategic and a single game with encompass many tactical battles.  Compared to European Chess, the first move in Shogi is a smaller advantage and draws are very rare.  To me, this strongly suggests that Shogi is the better game.

Very likely the most well designed ancient game (though Go is overall better). With its more patient strategic character, slower pieces and a well fortified starting position as well  as its subtle and effective "drop" mechanism, it makes Chess look like the classroom paste-eater.

I have to be in the mood for abstracts, but when I am Shogi is always a good choice.  The way captured pieces go in hand rather than out of the game creates exciting end games featuring two potentially powerful armies rather than two weak armies (thinned out through game-long attrition) as found in western chess.

Of the abstracted combat games (the various Chess developments), the Shogi family of games really appeal to me.

One of the greatest games ever invented.
Chess is one of my favorite games, and I'm a decent player (I'll beat a master 25% of the time).
Japanese Chess (Shogi) is a few hundred years older than International Chess.  The great thing about shogi is that the pieces never stay off the board.  Instead of moving, you may 'drop' a captured piece in just about any open square on the 9x9 board.  
If you dig Shogi, and you're into the 'fantasy' scene try 'Navia Dratp'

Japanese chess is slower and more defensive than western. Most of the pieces are lower power. So you build a fortress around your king and its sort of a race to see who can break whos castle down first. Pieces aren't destroyed in this game when they are attacked. Instead you capture them and can drop them back on to the board on your side. This is very cool and makes piece swapping far more significant.

I think of this as upgraded Chess, and offers much more to consider, with more varied promotion and the awesome capture mechanic. Unfortunately like Chess, this game is suited to long turns where you ponder over the board.

Shogi is a more aggressive and tense game, because the drop rule leads to extended assaults and a density of tactics. People routinely study positions where they have to force every one of their opponent's moves, culminating in checkmate.

====

Shogi has vaulted past Chess as my Chess-like of choice. The game is reminiscent of Chess with generally weaker pieces but with two elements that add a level of complexity that blows Chess out of the water. First, the promotion rule is enough to make my mind smoke. Imagine how much harder Chess would be if pawns could promote to pieces with King-like movement and Bishops/Rooks gained orthogonal/diagonal single moves upon reaching the 6th ranks. How much depth would that add? A lot I'd think (there must be a Chess variant with this right?). However, leaving even the promotion rule in the dust for complexity, the drop rule is a mind rending mechanic. Imagine in Chess if at any time you could drop a captured piece back onto the board -- how much depth would that add? My estimate is a crap-ton. Shogi makes me feel like a Chess newbie again which is something that I haven't felt in a long time.

Very happy to have finally played shogi. It plays out basically like western chess, but is extremely brutal with drops and promotions- two aspects of Japanese chess that really sets it beyond any other game of its ilk. It is different enough from both western chess and xiangqi that it is a worthy part of any game lover's closet.

I have not played this in over 15 years. But I still have my set that I ordered from Ishi Press back then. I used to play with a friend of mine all the time. If you like Western chess, then you will like Shogi even more. It's like Chess to the second power. I loved that no pieces ever leave the game completely. I love the Horse and Dragon (promoted Bishop and Rook, respectively). Para-dropping pieces is also great. I think the reason I haven't been able to get people to play with me is the Japanese characters on the pieces. I'm willing to bet if I put some westernized stickers over the pieces that show the moves that it would help new players get over their aversion to the game.

Picking up a Shogi set at BGGCON was a natural thing to do since I've become interested in Mahjong, particularly the Japanese version, Riichi.

While I don't have any clue as to what I'm doing, Dōbutsu Shōgi in the Greenwood provides a great learning set on which to play Shogi. The way in which captured pieces can be simply dropped in lieu of playing a piece allows for a fair deal of creativity and almost disallows the lock-ups/lock-downs that sometimes occur in chess. Even exchanges don't simplify the match, rather, they make it more complex as each player walks away with a potential edge.

Again, the aesthetics of the Dobutsu shogi are too darn cute while also being incredibly functional (for players who can't read kanji).

RATING: 9
A lot of chess players who would probably enjoy shogi for its increased versatility are likely scared away by how foreign the pieces look. Even if you can't read the characters, it's easy to pick up what piece is what after a few games. While some tactics are compatible for both chess and shogi (such as forking, or castling), the overall strategy is very different. I'd encourage everyone to try this game at least once.

Rating for nostalgia only.

My father taught me Shogi, but having learned Chess at about the same time, I made the common mistake of thinking western-style tactics. After reading "Shogi for Beginners" by Fairbairn, I can really appreciate the subtlety and complexity of this timeless classic. The extremely limited mobility (when compared to chess) is offset by the fact that most of all pieces can promote (compared to just a pawn) in the last three ranks of enemy camp, and that pieces can be "dropped" anywhere, like in Bughouse Chess. This makes a lone pawn in hand deadly, as there is a saying: "A pawn-less (in hand) game of Shogi is a lost game of Shogi."

Now, having said all that, this requires many years of practice in order to play well, much like Chess. I am not willing to devote that kind of effort at this point in my life. Also, it is extremely difficult to find a worthy opponent in the US, so finding communities of practicing players is tantamount to becoming a better player.

Love this variant, maybe a little more than Xiang Qi (chinese chess) which I also love though it is a little restrictive with some pieces but I love how the tank can jump pieces in Xiang Qi. Shogi has the promotion scheme and of course the "drop in" of captured pieces (similiar to bug house) which makes it sooooo interesting. It does seem like there is more to explore here or maybe just a ton more options...

Shogi is reminiscent of Xiangqi in some ways: brittle and unintuitive support chains (compared to Chess), and focus on tactical use of a couple of power pieces. The tactical threat of dropped pieces is ever present and ever important, so even if you think yourself gaining strategically you may be just a few exchanges away from certain defeat. Attacking by advancing and expanding your territory means creating a perfect playground for your opponent.

I made a very crude custom copy when I was a kid and then never got anyone to play it. True story.

This has a good deal of complexity as relative to western chess, largely b/c of two major rules changes (1st, captured pieces can be placed on the board and, 2nd, nearly all pieces can advance for promotion - even newly placed pieces can be promoted).  Usually only the length, longer than a game of western chess, would deter me from playing an amateur (experts would trounce me handily).

Excellent Asian chess game that deserves its classic status.  My experience is very limited and I'm not completely familiar with the Japanese characters on the pieces yet, but I have the sense that this will become a favorite if I can manage to explore it further.  The promotion of pieces and the drop mechanism make Shogi differ from traditional Western chess in a more dramatic way than Xianqi does.

Tra scacchi europei, cinesi e giapponesi, questi sono decisamente i miei preferiti.
I pezzi possono essere promossi in pezzi piu forti e le pedine nemiche catturate possono essere riutilizzate a proprio vantaggio.
Aggiunge notevole profondità al gioco. Non che gli scacchi europei ne accusino la mancanza.
Al contrario penso che gli scacchi cinesi, il Xiangqi, sia un gioco vagamente piu leggero e di veloce attuazione.

I am terrible at Western chess and after playing Shogi it is good to know that if I went halfway across the world I would be terrible at their version of chess as well.  This however is the only constant as Shogi adds elements which totally changes your approach and mindset to how chess should / can be played.  I lost quickly and dramatically but in ways I had never seen before.  Therefore, one of my favourite defeats.  Refreshing and mind-expanding.

RATING: 6
Compared to chess the range of movement of most pieces is much shorter, so it is harder to threaten a large amount of pieces at a time, while at the same time allowing more freedom of movement without worrying about being captured. The dropping of pieces on the board means you have to balance making favorable piece trades with gradually tightening the area around the opponent's king so that a few piece drops at the end of the game can finish him off

In occidental Chess, the board begins full of pieces, and slowly clears up as pieces get captured.

In Shogi, captured pieces can be parachuted back onto the board. This makes for a very different chess experience.

I'm a complete novice at this game, as I am with Chess. You could play and analyse both your whole life and only just scratch the surface, so first impressions are important when deciding if a game like that is worth your time and effort. If I had to choose, Shogi would take the prize. It just seems more appealing. An example: Once you take a piece it belongs to you (the military unit defected to the other side perhaps?) and you may put it back into play later. That alone seems to me to provide a much more exciting (and richer?) dynamic than Chess, for my money...the Chess pieces are more iconic though ;)

The threat of dropping is awesome!

It's tough to find local opponents dedicated enough to learn, and I'm not dedicated enough to study it like a club player would. Kanji isn't the only thing keeping this from being more popular, but it is a deterrent to many. I like how the variant, [gameid=56796], marks movement patterns.

[gameid=28389] is a light alternative that uses many of the same pieces and rules.

Another game that's conspicuously absent when I check my friends' stuff out. I'm the only one I know who has it. But I'd rather this than Chess any day - larger board, more units, unit promotions, combinatorial movement ranges/patterns for promoted units, highly nonlinear mid-/end-/protracted-game behaviors, recruiting of captured units, and perhaps the best part: you can make or get a truly fine Shogi set for far less than an upmarket Chess set. 

For DIYers, the pieces require no lathe-turning and are simple pentagons with a slightly wedge-shaped/tapered profile that narrows toward the point. All have names analagous or thematically related to units from either European chess. You can use the ideograms (suggested) or English names; Wikipedia will tell you what they are.

As for me, I bought pieces for $8 and then made a fine board using materials I already had, and consider it one of the best returns-on-investment (re: time, money, AND effort) I've made in games.

Don't let the LOOK fool you - this is the chess that chess wishes it could be. How far has computer Shogi advanced, and can a computer yet defeat Shogi masters?

08/24/12 Acquired the Internationalized Version of Shogi distributed by the Elephant Chess Club. The rule book is copyright 1979. The pieces are thick yellow plastic with icons, one side green and the other (promoted side) red. The "board" is folded thrice and made of a very thin yellow plastic, that I know I'll have a heck of a time getting to lie flat. Basically this set reeks of cheapness, and was *not* the version in the photo (with a wooden board and wooden pieces) at Cool Stuff's website, who sold it to me. On the other hand it was only 7 bucks. Oh well, I guess it'll be good enough to learn the game with. At least I won't have to stare at Chinese/Japanese  characters on the pieces. 
05/31/14 Finally got around to playing (and winning) three games. In spite of the extremely cheap set I bought, and the confusion of both player's pieces being the same color initially (something the crappy black & white rule book didn't mention until page 16!!!), I liked Shogi. I have the mechanics down now. Next I'll work towards grasping the strategy in future outings.  
09/26/15 Played and won three more games.

Well, it's Chess. However, Shogi makes Chess interesting again. My main problem with Western Chess is how the game gets boring when pieces are removed - the drops in Shogi make that problem go away very neatly. The game stays exciting.

Still, Shogi is somewhat tedious and the learning curve is a bit too steep for casual play with newbies.

Shogi plays a bit slower than Chess due to the limited mobility of most of the pieces and the use of captured pieces that can be dropped onto the board, especially in the endgame.

Regardless, the game is quite good. I've had some difficulty finding an opponent, however.

This isn't really a dislike for Shogi the game but it is nearly impossible to find a decent set in the US without paying through the nose for a nice set from Japan directly. My set is a tiny folding board set which is not worthy of this amazing game. 

[b][u]Overall:[/u][/b] 
No other game fills this abstract niche quite like Shogi. Its a shame that Chess is the predominate abstract in Western culture when games like Go and Shogi are vastly superior.

Shogi differs from western chess in several ways:

- The board is not checkered and is 9x9 (instead of 8x8)
- You have more pieces and their movements are generally more limited.
- Pieces can be promoted to gain different movement patterns and there are promotion zones on the board where this is allowed to happen.
- On your turn, captured pieces can be reintroduced (dropped) anywhere on the board (with limited exceptions) in lieu of moving a piece.
- All pieces are the same color so if a piece is pointing at you (the player), you know it is attacking you.
- There are no special castling rules or en passant captures; it's a very WYSIWYG.

I've taught shogi to many players and have found the two main hurdles most people struggle with are the Japanese symbols (kanji) and the challenge of recognizing where and when drops should happen.

The good news is there are single kanji sets you can get that simplify the amount of symbols on each piece making them a little easier to recognize. Some of these sets also use red paint or ink on the bottom of the pieces to aid in quickly assessing what pieces are currently promoted.  There are also trainer sets of shogi (one by Kumon and another by Shogi.CZ) that are good places to start in order to learn movement - these include arrows and/or symbols that show each piece's movement on the piece itself.

The second hurdle - piece drops - is a much more complex concept that requires experience to understand how to utilize, anticipate, and prevent effectively.  There are many books available that help players drill the topic as well as books and apps with mating puzzles to reinforce checking patterns that involve drops (which, big surprise, most checking patterns involve drops of some sort).

TL;DR: Shogi is a rich, dynamic and elegant alternative to western chess that brings in unique concepts like piece drops and promotions to maintain a high level of complexity from start to finish. These concepts open up new ways of thinking about piece sacrifices and exchanges in this uniquely Japanese version of chess. Highly recommended.

Truly excellent classic centuries-old strategy game. Similar to familiar International Chess, yet also very different.

Being able to drop captured pieces back onto the board [i]really[/i] changes things in an interesting good way. And most pieces can be promoted, not just pawns.

After years of thinking about Shogi from afar, procrastinating due to the initial kanji learning hurdle, I finally bought a set in late 2011 and was pleasantly surprised how quickly we got used to the kanji. We started with [gameid=28389] to get used to the kanji and basic tactics, and then soon started enjoying full Shogi. For learning, there are in fact multiple small board variants using subsets of the pieces, all worth trying out.

Of possible interest: [geeklist=196102][/geeklist]

===

There are various variations of the pieces (e.g. with 1 or 2 kanji symbols; with red or black symbols on the promoted side; with neat regular "printed" kanji or less legible sloppy "hand-written" kanji; slightly different symbols in printed diagrams in problems and strategy articles)... This is an annoying barrier to entry for people who don't know kanji already. (Imagine if International Chess pieces were all just tiles with the English words "pawn", "king", "rook", "knight" etc printed on them, and different sets used different typefaces and handwriting styles, and sometimes printed "tower" and "horse" instead of "rook" and "knight", and you were someone who didn't already know the Latin alphabet...)

Too bad, because Shogi is great and deserves more attention! Instead, it remains less well-known than Chess (outside of Japan), in contrast with Go (which does not have this technical barrier to entry, its pieces being simply black and white stones). And so you usually need to mail-order shogi books & equipment instead of seeing them in most local bookstores and game stores.

But it's worth it. Great game. :)

Get a Japanese set. All the literature (game records etc) use kanji / kana, and if you can't learn a couple of scribbly characters -- which are worth knowing anyway -- then the game itself is probably too hard for you. I can read the suckers and it's still way too hard for me.

Be prepared to forget a lot of what you know from chess.  Despite outward similarities to chess, shogi is a different bird.  For example, the cycling of pieces via the drop rule might drive players of western chess to distraction.  I'm just beginning to find my way around this incredible game.  Because of the slow opening, players have some time to devote themselves to defense before commencing their attack.  For this reason here are a number of different "castles" they can construct for their king.  Players' attacks will almost certainly fail if they have given insufficient thought to their defense first.  In Shogi several battles may take place simultaneously ... some of them simply to obtain material for drops. Shogi is glorious.

Buy a set which has the legal moves diagrammed on the pieces themselves, rather than the Japanese ideograms for the piece names.  That way you'll learn how to play much faster.  

Significant differences from chess include pawns taking straight forward (no pawn chains, no interlocking of pawns), promotion of all pieces except the gold general, and the rule that capture of a piece allows you to "paradrop" it back onto the board as yours (with a few limitations).  Mobility is lower since most pieces move only one space at a time.  There are books of Shogi puzzles which are worth getting to help your play.

This is what chess was always supposed to be like. Placing captured pieces back on the board and the close quarters fighting is much more nail-bitingly intense than chess.

It feels a bit more cramped for this very reason.

But it's a very good classical game. If you can manage the calligraphy it's also one of the most beautiful games I can think of.

RATING: 9
Less puzzle-y than chess because of the weakness of the pieces. Feels very war-like. In chess, there's a feeling that almost every area of the board can be under threat from any other at any point in time. With the limited movement of shogi pieces, there a distinct feeling that you are playing on a battlefield where multiple fights are breaking out at once. For me, this is a substitute for games like Command and Colors, but I realize that after more practice I'll probably think of it as a more abstract game.

RATING: 6
Deep and refined Japanese version of chess with the idea of paradropping pieces that runs entirely counter to everything known about warfare. Checkmating patterns hinge on knowing what pieces you have in your hand to drop and calculating these fantastic mate while your K runs to cover. It's all very complex but bordering on esoteric.

I think this is interesting. Total pieces in play never necessarily drops. This might be as good as an 8, but I'm currently too poor at it to judge.

I cannot remember being ever so addicted to a game like Shogi. Unbelievable, especially since I'm no chess connoisseur (In fact I'm a lousy chess player). Don't ever make the mistake to think of Shogi as just Chess plus the additional rule that captured pieces may be brought back into play. As I see it, this may be true for Neo chess/Chessgi/Bughouse but for Shogi this description is too superficial, and even misleading, since you might get the wrong impression from it. Besides, it does not explain what is so fascinating about re-entering pieces.

Some  important differences you may not be aware of:
----------------------------------------
You  play on a 9x9 board with 20 pieces (instead of 8x8 and 16 pieces for western Chess. And if you try some Shogi variants it can get both much bigger or smaller. Actually, most bigger Shogi variants do not allow dropping of pieces, and they are still regarded as Shogi variants.) The pieces are arranged in three ranks instead of two and a queen is unknown in Shogi like lances, gold and silver generals are unknown in Western Chess. Apart from this, in Shogi you only have one bishop and rook.
-----------------------------------------
Promotion of pieces plays a very important role and is not comparable to Western chess. For example a simple pawn can be promoted to a very strong tokin, once it enters the enemy's area consisting of his last 3 ranks. But that is not all, the interesting thing is, that your powerful tokin once it is captured by your enemy depromotes to a pawn again. Additionally you can now (that is after promoting a pawn) drop another pawn on the same file (normally you are limited to one pawn per file, even if you have more pawns captured, you are not allowed to place them there). There are still much more subtleties (e.g. sometimes it is useful not to promote) but this would lead to far.  
----------------------------------------      
Castles:  Similarly to the limited possibility of promotion in Chess, Castles  in Western Chess (in German called Rochade) are not comparable to castles in Shogi. In Shogi, you can choose of a multitude of formations that both protect your king and create the preconditions for a successful attack/defence. Additionally, In Shogi you do not make unnatural double moves like e2-e4,  and strange things like "en passant", or the magical change of position during castling which always looks like the work of a thimblerigger (is this really the equivalent to the German "Huetchenspieler") are unknown.
-----------------------------------------
The tendency to reward fearless, brave and bold play, which has to do with the fact that all pieces (kings excluded) are very limited in their backwards movement and besides can be promoted, which offers new possibilities. If you are too cautious, you have already lost. Defending is certainly important, but you cannot concentrate entirely on it. Instead you have to find a way to counter-attack. Quite often it appears that you are in a desperate situation, but later in the game you might get the chance to strike back. This sort of surprises I have not experienced in Chess.
-----------------------------------------         
Apart from (promoted) rooks and bishops, pieces have a limited range. In chess, you have lots of extremely powerful pieces and very limited space (at least when you start). In Shogi, it is different. It can easily happen that pieces, like gold or silver, get totally out of place and become rather worthless.
----------------------------------------       
Material advantage is just one aspect but not the only  aspect that determines the outcome of the game. The concept of shape is also very important, meaning how well pieces cooperate, that is how well they protect each other. Isolated pieces are most often easy prey for your opponent. Also the value of pieces is not static but always depends on the actual situation and changes during the course of a game. For example, gold generals are exquisite pieces for mating purposes, but in the beginning you most often use silver generals in order to attack and gold generals to defend your king. 
-----------------------------------------      
Draws are very unlikely, especially among beginners.
-----------------------------------------         
Tsume Shogi/mating problems (you have to check your opponent each move you make until he has lost) are extremely exciting puzzles in their own right and very important in real games. Quite often you find yourself in a situation where you have to keep on checking your opponent with the intention to find a checkmate situation, always knowing that if you fail and lose tempo/initiative your opponent will immediately mate you. This is a tremendous thrill, and gives Shogi the character of a racing game (in this regard not unlike Yinsh).
-----------------------------------------        
Tesujis, often translated as clever moves/techniques used in a certain situation. If I have to single out what fascinates me most then it is to see some virtuoso Shogi players start some incredible sequences of moves. Perhaps a tesuji is comparable to what games like checkers or Zertz centre around. For example, in Zertz you start by feeding your opponent with less valuable marbles in order to arrange his marbles in a way that you can capture them which gives you a bigger benefit than the ones you offered him. In Shogi there are very similar situations.Funnily, very often clever moves look extremely dull at first glance, like dropping a pawn directly in front of your opponent's rook or gold general, but once he captures this piece he might get into trouble of being immediately captured by another piece, and if he tries to retreat (if possible) his castle might get mixed up, and become prone to a strong attack. A lot more could be said but I better stop now.

The best version of chess ever created. Seriously, it's chess "fixed." Pawns capture and move one space forward, instead of moving and capturing differently; no two-move castling rule: castles are made by several moves where you bring the King to safety and bring other pieces up to protect the King; very few draws and no big advantage for the first player; and a wonderful handicap system where you can play a beginner or the world champion and have a close game.

I have a set, it looks beautiful, and I even tried to play it once.  But it's as stressful as Chess, and in Japanese.  Come on, Japanese people - can't you invent little figures?  Makes it much easier for the beginner.

Like chess but without the over-powerful pieces (of course drops can be very powerful), and the middle game never ends :-)

I also have:

Japanese Chess. Pieces you have captured may be placed on the board. Almost all pieces promote when they reach opponent's side of board.

Shogi is a great game. Skill at Western chess ports over a bit more readily than for Xiangqi, in my experience. However, the endgame is completely different due to drops--you basically never get to a classical chess endgame situation with a small number of pieces and lots of space. This is fun because things are much more dynamic longer (and I kind of suck at the endgame, so I'm not sorry to see it go!). It probably also means computers will be worse at Shogi since they can't rely on endgame databases.

I have the certified cutest version of Shogi ever produced: "Dobutsu Shogi in the Greenwood". Recommend this version (or another version for kids) for newbies since you don't have to memorize the kanji to play. (Although, I play Xiangqi with a proper Chinese set, and it only takes 1-2 games to get over this hurdle.)

Possibly a better game than chess. Captured pieces become yours, to be dropped on the board on your turn.  Pieces promote on the back rank, changing their movement characteristics.

Like chess or xiangqi, this is pure strategy at its finest, but what sets this apart from those related games [related in the sense of descending from the same ancient game but very different otherwise, albeit with marked similarities too] is that pieces are always in play-- even after captures have been made. Thus the end game is not and cannot be a problem of 3 or 4 pieces on an empty board.

It should be a 9 or 10 rating game but I rarely play. I only ever played against PC and I've lost my copy of Shogi Master by Ishi Press.

I learned a lot about this game from Hidetchi on YouTube.  I am terrible at it, but I really love it.  I grew up playing chess, and this is mindblowing to me.  The possibilities expand as the game goes on, rather than being reduced.

Do you like studying?

Not as fast/tactical as Xiangqi, and more complicated than Western Chess.  More complex than either.

If you really want to learn it yourself, teach your young daughter.  She'll learn the Kanji right away for you.  You'll probably be surprised at how well she catches on to the rules, and she'll prefer it to blah Western chess and won't stop asking you to play.  It's the drops.  And the cool characters.  And you're flipping pieces over to reveal their red "alter egos" as you promote them. 

In fact my kids like it much more than I do.   To them it's a wild, exotic, colourful and epic adventure compared to other chesses.  But that's because they still have imaginations and they interpret the world as wonderful.  I'm an enlightened adult, and therefore see Shogi as a 900 page advanced physics text book---interesting if only I had time.

Go more succinctly fulfills my mania for abstraction; Xiangqi gives me the gritty taste of knife-fighting tactical combinatorics I crave every once in a while.  This is some hideous monstrosity between those two which must have been designed by generations of Japanese ubergeeks who'd never been shown ASL.

I'd rate it a 10 if not for Go:)  THE greatest of all chess games.  The ability to "paratroop" captured pieces back into play is both exciting and jarring!  IMHO, there is nothing better in this game than the simultaneous race to checkmate aka "brinkmate" your opponent.

When is chess more than chess? When its Shogi!  The less powerful individual pieces take some getting used to for an international chess player, but its worth it because reintroducing captured pieces to the board gives a whole new meaning to assessing board position! It also sometimes makes deciding what pieces to trade for capture much more difficult.  All in all its Chess++ and I'd like to spend some time learning this one.

Dropping in pieces you captured from your opponent as your own provides some fascinating scenarios and challenges.  It also means losing a key piece is doubly dangerous.  The ability for nearly every piece to promote, though usually to a piece that can only move one space, is also key to making this a very fun chess to play.

As I said about traditional shogi on 2007-02-06, "Dropping in pieces you captured from your opponent as your own provides some fascinating scenarios and challenges.  It also means losing a key piece is doubly dangerous.  The ability for nearly every piece to promote, though usually to a piece that can only move one space, is also key to making this a very fun chess to play."  With [boardgameversion=135734]Dobutsu Shogi in the Greenwood[/boardgameversion], there is utterly cute art on the pieces, but more importantly, the moves are clearly depicted on the pieces in a way that is also aesthetically pleasing.

Shogi is a wonderful abstract.  Though it shares similarities with Chess, it opens up many more play possibilities as the game develops, instead of closing them off.  The early game is the weakest point, but the mid to late games are always interesting.

RATING: 9
When I purchased Battleground, this is what I was looking for. This game is great. It allows you to customize your team and fight another player. Think of it as a strategy game with a very light wargame background. My SO even plays it with me. The only bad thing I can say about this game is that the board that ships with the two originals is just a piece of folded up paper; it is the worst "board" I have ever seen for a game. You can buy a real board from the publisher's website for $10.

More depth here than you might initially think.  Well balanced armies and lots of back and forth play.

RATING: 10
For me, this is THE game of the last couple of years. Think of a modern streamlined version of warhammer that is portable, cheap ($10 for an army, or even less if you get the master set), easy to teach and plays in less than an hour. Well, this is exactly what this is. 

...however, it also has some down-sides. Specifically, I find the art and graphic design to be uninspiring. I also don't like the idea of walls as the sources of units - they should have been towers or strongholds or something, that would have made a lot more thematic sense.

Moved it up to a 10 after getting the second starter pack and getting some plays in with all the factions.  Great game.  Well designed and nice variety.  Each faction is unique and plays very differently.  You have to use different muscles with each faction to have the most success.  Tactical errors seem to hurt more than bad swings of luck with dice.  I just wish this would have been out when my kids were getting into Yu Gi Oh.

Favorite game so far.  Lots of fun.

Good mix of cards, chess, and war gaming in a bite size yet fulfilling game.

Been playing a lot of ios of the first 8 factions.  Lots of fun.  The first core 4 decks (Phoenix Elves, Guild Dwarves, Tundra Orcs, Cave Goblins)are a bit stronger than the 2nd 4 (Vanguard, Cloaks, Fallen Kingdom, Jungle Elves).
But it's still a lot of fun to explore and play.

RATING: 5
Phoenix Elves vs. Tundra Orcs starter.

Dull play, few unique units, rules "work" and it's in some sense not terrible; but the play is not interesting enough...  Lacks the animation of something "similar" -- for me, why play this when Neuroshima Hex! is around?

Very very good game. The dice are extremely annoying, yet thats what makes the game so fun after all. The amount of luck is quite big but u always feel like u have important decisions during ur turn and there is definitely strategy and skill too. The amount of armies and the expansion packs for each one makes it a game that u will not get tired of in quite a while.

Excellent game. Very tactile in how you manipulate your cards and think about the board with lots of interesting and well-designed racial/unit abilities. Closest thing I've found yet in boardgaming to tactics games like Fire Emblem, FF Tactics, or Advance Wars. My rating is for the overall system and various races available out there altogether.

RATING: 2
I think of it like a game of Stratego with races and special abilities. I dislike that kind of games that have so many expansions in order to "milk" the customers so no buy for me. I don't care for it much and I prefer Blue Moon Legends for a 2-player card game. It's a far more honest proposal and a better game for me and all the cards are in the main box already plus the promos.

My favorite game in the world until just recently. I love this game so much and really enjoy the mechanics and feel of it. Army building can be very rewarding too. My only grievance is that I have the worst luck with die rolls in it, and it is a game that definitely rewards strategies that last the duration of the game, rather than precision gambits. Unfortunately it also the game where I am most likely to have a total melt down in response to a poor die roll. I have had many, MANY, times where I roll say 4 dice and miss with all of them.

RATING: 7
Preliminary rating:8 (after two plays). This will more than likely increase with more plays.

After listening to Colby's "Scape talk" podcast and reading his posts at Heroscapers.com, my expectations of this game was sky high. Summoners War really delivered and was more fun than I could have imagined. The only drawback I can find is the paper mat that seems impossible to put flatten out, but this is a minor issue.

The rules and the starter decks are simple enough to get you going in less than 10 minutes. This game is FUN!

Update: This game is getting better and better now rated 9! I now have the two first expansions and the mounted map and this has increased the re-playability as well as esthetics a lot.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
This is an excellent tactical game and there is an abstract feel about the gameplay that I quite enjoy. Once you get to know you deck I believe you can play this in 30 minutes or less.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
The game is kind of a half-baked concept (more or less playing m:tg on a board) but it turns out that playing m:tg on a board is pretty fun. Too bad the physical game is so hard to find (especially many of the decks) but the app isn't terrible.

After more plays: some great ideas, but it doesn't really hold up in the long run. So many games come down to stalling until your opponent runs out of cards, which is generally just frustrating for everybody. I really want this game to be cool but in its current iteration it just doesn't quite stack up.

(Plus the resolution of the art in the app is terrible and the kludgy interface makes it really hard to know which decks you've bought, but that's not really a criticism of the game itself.) 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
My favourite game of all time.

I wasn't expecting much when I bought this, but boy has this game been a pleasant surprise!

It is basically a miniature wargame shrinked into card form and packed into a small box. For those of us who likes the genre but never had the time, money nor space to invest it, this is an amazing substitute. 

It also is simple to learn and play (even for non gamers), fast to play, and yet provides a deep amount of tactical play for those who want to be more engrossed in it. Turn to turn there are always tough decisions to be made. And just when you thought you had victory secured, the tide of war can swing about in the blink of an eye!

And the best part of the game? It's cheap. And there are constantly new factions/units in the works being produced which will add on to the variety of the game.

Did I mention that each faction also plays very much different from the others? 

Do some homework and try it out with the Starter decks to see if you will like it. Be warned, there may be no turning back!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A lot of good packed in this compact card game.

Plays in the standard time length a game of its type would take (30 min to an hour) and offers interesting tactical decisions each turn.

The theme is well represented with each faction feeling distinct yet balanced from one another.

For people looking for games similar (kinda) to Magic, this would be the one to get.  Additionally, this game feels similar (also kinda) to Heroscape, in terms of combat resolution, movement, range and unit abilities.  So might be worth the consideration if you're looking for a more portable version of that.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
Very easy to play. Simplistic designed does not distract the gamer from the game. Not much to say really. The game is fun to a point, but it really feels like it is missing a few things from the game. My wife and I tried to put a bead on what was missing and we came up with this.

Card art is bland (not a major issue).
The movement mechanics are bland (certain cards should move a certain way).
Not enough variety in effect or spell cards. Very bland to a fault.
Not enough cards in a deck.

The movement mechanics do not feel right. Certain troops should move a certain way. That would create a bit more variety in the game and make you play certain troops over others depending on the situation (a lot more than it does as of release).

There are only a few spell effects in the decks (elvs v orks) and they are just rubbish. They need more spells and effects to liven the game up. This to me is the biggest failing of the game. After playing Warhammer Invasion, Magic The Gathering and others (different types of games I know but the spell and effect cards a just fantastic), I feel that this game is very much lacking spell and effect cards.

If they fixed this then the game would get an easy 8 our of 10 from us.

Too dicey for my tastes.  Only tried two of the factions but don't think I'm interested in trying more.  I'd rather play Neuroshima Hex if it is about short tactical combat.

RATING: 9
This is an overview of the game: look at my owned games for the reviews of the expansions and added races.  Summoner Wars brings back the warm memories of CCG games like Magic the Gathering (please don't say Yu-gi-oh), without the annoying hassle of having to devote your time and money day and night, collecting cards just to stay on-top of the power curve.  So this ends up being more about individual racial decks and their strategy, as well as a 2D 8 by 6 landscape in which your "units" move, and also allows for a surprising amount of tactical positioning, unlike Magic.  Each race is very unique and relatively balanced, and while luck is present in the form of some dice rolling, it isn't enough for you to doubt your loses.  Their are a some special event cards within the decks that mainly assist a player from falling too far behind, and this keeps the game intense till the end, which given the short decks (30 cards).  The game only lasts about 15-30 mins, and each player charges into battle to kill the enemy summoner, which is victory.  Solid, simple, fantasy battle fun, for two.

RATING: 7
Well, wasn't sure how I felt about this at first, but wasn't too bad.  Cards represent units or events, and you move them around the map, simple attack rules, rolling to deal damage.  Each army does have a very different feel, and your pace in the game really dictates your success.  I could see myself enjoying the game, I probably just need another play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
BattleLore light...much more portable and not so many scenarios.  I'm looking forward to getting some more factions in there, but I'm liking it so far.  Some of the champions are pretty intimidating, but knowing how to use the abilities of your common units is a big help.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Excellent little game.  After about ~7 plays, Scratches the CCG and tactical battle itches at the same time.  Elves and Orcs only so far, but definitely looking forward to picking up the other factions for some more variety!

Not sure I get the appeal here. It isn't a bad game, but it is just too derivative of Heroscape/Stratego/etc. I didn't find the gameplay especially deep or strategic, which it and of itself isn't a big problem for me, but it just lacked the fun of similar style games. I really dislike the artwork as well, but that is a minor thing for me. If you are going to play it and have an ipad, the ios version is the way to go as it is much cheaper and it is quite well done.

Really fun game. It somewhat feels like ccg but the added board provides yet another dimension as you're not only summoning creatures as in ccg but also need to control and manouvere them on the battlefield. There is also nice asymmetrical feel to the game with each faction having its own strenghts and weaknesess. The only drawback is the quality of the map - not only it is boring paper map but it is folded so many times in order to fit in the box that it looks terrible when unfolded for the play.

I was so hyped about this after hearing many good things about but I just cannot bring myself to like it. While it is interesting that cards are used instead of miniatures, I would prefer miniatures to flesh out the board.

Plus this is a 2 player game. I generally do 2 players with my wife. I highly doubt this will be on her games to play list so it made the rating of this game fall even lower for me.

The factions are nice but I cannot appreciate the art, just think it can be better but yeah, there are worse art out there.

Update: The many, many expansions for this game didn't bring about the resurgence I thought they would. I find the game pretty bland these days.

----------

I am absolutely loving this game right now (20ish plays).  Summoner Wars hits the mark on so many counts:

1) Depth-to-length ratio is spot on
2) The four factions seem balanced
3) The four factions "feel" different
4) Expansions on the horizon keep me in anticipation

2 and 3 are so uncommon for asymmetric games.  If the next couple factions are as fab as the first four, SW will be a 10 no doubt.

Instant Top 5 favorite.  Play involves two from a variety of factions going head to head to out wit each other as you leverage your factions strengths, protect their weaknesses and make tactical moves around the board in attempt to eliminate your opponent's Summoner.

Further iOS. 8 factions. I think the game has potential, but random cards plus dice seems to lead to a rather frustrating experience. You spend the whole game setting up your big attack on the opposing summoner, and then score 1 hit out of 8. This happens repeatedly on iOS. to the extent that I am beginning to think it just cheats on AI.

Only played on iPhone and quickly realized that this is a game I do not have opponents for. This is not a casual game, it requires replaying to get the most out of it, and the times I get to sit down with a confrontational two-player game like this are rare indeed.

Apart from that, the game is very solid. If yoy have the opponent and think the premise sounds cool, go for it.

RATING: 7
This game is played with more fondness than is its due.  Not a single mechanic here is truly unique with the closest contender to that epithet the use of dead enemies as currency.  If you set out to design a card-based fantasy wargame with movement you would probably come up with something fairly similar.

My main complaint is that most games seem to go down to the last few cards in the deck which suggests that it in the end it came down to who rolled better.  Striking for an early win is near impossible and killing walls is a lot of wasted effort with their 9 health.  Also the champions seem wildly divergent in power, Magic Drain cards are ridiculous and the factions have some balance issues (Goblins just seem to give the enemy magic with their cheap/weak soldiers).

Still, quite fun for what it is.

Extremely watered down Magic The Gathering, with elements of Stratego thrown in. It falsely portrays team play, when in reality it's just two separate games going on. Won't be wasting my money on this stinker. So many better choices out there.

Love how balanced all the factions are. Games are under 45 minutes and are usually very close and intense and very different each time. Use the expansion packs often to add even more variability. Always fun!

RATING: 6.5
Quick battle game with cards and magic and summoning thing and stuff. More complex than the Battle for Hill 218 (which I prefer for it's sheer speed and simplicity) and not as complex as any other blocky or mini type battle games. Not sure how it stacks up vs Battleground Fantasy warfare, but it's dedent enough, although there's luck based aspects in both the dice rolls (as expected) and the draw deck order.

I appreciate that it was simple rules.  After a couple of plays all the different cards in your deck would be easy to remember what their special abilities are...  I don't like the play mat, but it is pretty critical to this game.  A felt version would be much nicer.  I'd definitely play this again, but won't buy it.

RATING: 8
Summoner Wars represents a terrific game system. Two different game mechanics and experiences are streamlined - card management and tactical gaming - and improbably integrated. What comes about a result is a remarkably elegant result which is lots of fun to play. What I'm struck by mostly is the value of the game. The rules are ultra-simple and the time investment of a two player game is minimal (30 - 45 minutes) but you are rewarded so much for the minimal investments. The game is deeper than it looks and the different decks play more differently than one would think. While not a filler, Summoner Wars is a light game which is absolutely perfect when you have two geeks who may not on a given day have the time or energy for War of the Ring. It's a game that fills this sweet spot as no other does for me. Now that the Master Set is available, that really is the set to get, but the two player sets are where it all started. With the paper mats (better in the second editions) they're still great for travelling light.

Inital rating, need to play it more. 

Fast, interesting filler tactical minatures game without minatures :)

Different sides play very differently, and need a different approach. Simple rules, but the gameplay involves interesting decisions.

Overall - like it, not sure I'd want to play with 3 or 4 though.

*** Update, played some more and I'm still liking it. Now I want expansions for the original races and mercenaries to deck build rather than more new races.

Rating increased a point.

Update 12/2014: got tired of this. Too random, artwork is pretty lame, and if I'm going to play a combination of spacial strategy and ability synergies I'm going to play Vortex every time (as someone correctly said, compared to Vortex, Summoner Wars seems like somebody's idea of a joke). And if I'm going to roll buckets of dice, I'll have a LOT more fun with C&C Ancients. So there you go, no more SW for me. Collection went to a new home.

I own all the Wave 1 factions and almost all the reinforcements, plus a couple of the 2nd Summoners. I'm probably tapped out on purchases for this, but there's a lot of game here and as my son gets old enough to play this, I think we'll be doing it a LOT.

Pretty fun little battle game.  I like the tension of trying to hold on with limited forces while you build up magic to bring your heroes out.  They heroes feel appropriately heroic without being completely overpowered.  Probably the best miniatures-type game out there - better than Battleground Fantasy Warfare and the Pocket Battles series, anyway.

Quickly grew on the entire family. Well, not so much the wife. Definitely has the "just one more time" appeal. Have Elves and Orcs - need to order the other factions. While I don't even notice the map once the game starts - I'll admit that's the only reason this isn't a 10 for me.

Fun game that gets even more interesting with repeated plays. Knowing your deck (and more importantly, the opposing deck) is key. This plays much more like a tactical minis game than a card game. Don't let the simple rules fool you -- this is a cutthroat tactics game!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
A relatively standard tactical miniature game that succeeds on many levels.
- Few units types per side, so there's not much memorizing special abilities.
- A small battlefield without terrain makes movement simple yet tactical.
- Tough decisions on playing lots of grunts vs. only a few powerhouses.

Consider me a fan!

UPDATE: I've been enjoying this in its iOS incarnation, I think mainly because a) the PlayDek implementation is excellent, and b) playing asynchronously gets rid of the tedious downtime of the physical version. The problem is you've nothing to do on your opponents' turn - no card play, no response dice, no counterattacks, no nothing. Because this is an amateur US designer and not a professional European, you draw cards at the beginning of your turn instead of the end, so you can't even contemplate your next move until the beginning of your turn (really guys, this is amateur hour stuff). The final problem is that the endgame can be really tedious, as a player who's clearly going to win can be forced to do a real slog hunting down a beaten Summoner and finishing him off. Anyway, all this is not cool and betrays amateur design/development and means I don't really have any desire to play the board game again, but the iOS version is fine, fun even, because you don't have to worry about downtime anymore. Unlike Nightfall and Ascension, async is the way to play this one.
---
This was fun. I'm not sure there is a ton of game here, but you get to move guys around and roll lots of dice, and there is some tension on building up your magic piles. Horrible writing on the special power texts, unfortunately (clear but massively over-wordy). Anyway, I enjoyed this as a light battle game filler, and am looking at picking up another pack or two.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Not recommended. 

Too many questions for such a simple game. For example: does the 3-space ability of Mook work past walls or other units? or is it blocked like LOS? Also: Does the Dwarven Defender keep opposing pieces from moving only if they start adjacent? or if they move adjacent at any point during a move?

Overly wordy. For example, the 45-word Goblin Rage card works the same with the following concise text: Swift Strike: Your Cave Goblin units with Summon Costs of 0 may attack twice in a row this turn (instead of attacking only once). Also: the Dwarven Defender's 14-word ability could be shortened to 5 words: Adjacent enemy units cannot move.

Different backs for mercenary units? Both you and your opponent know exactly when one will be drawn.... *eyeroll*

The paper map had to be folded five times (!) to fit in the tiny box. It is almost unusable without plexiglass atop it.

And why in the world are players' units summoned next to walls (!?) instead of next to their ... um ... SUMMONER?

For a much better game with similar mechanics, try Dreamblade instead.

Only a play or two under my belt and I would judge this an interesting medium wight game. As the box says it is tactical, perhaps overly so and like Memoir it swings drastically with the roll of the dice. Once you've played though this is reasonably simple though I wonder about the replayability. Still I have only played twice and will no doubt learn more. TO its credit it is a small box and a very reasonable price. I hope expansion decks are sold seperately and are at a lower price point.

The more I play this game, the more I enjoy it though its fallen out of favor as of late.  Every game is exciting, with back and forth plays and seems to come down to the wire.

The different Armies feel incredibly balanced, the time is just right, and it doesn't rob me of an arm and leg - basically, this game nails everything I want in a game.

Ever have the itch to pull out those nice painted miniatures and clash with another army on the tabletop, replete with fantasy theme and special powers, but only have an hour?  Not going to happen with minis.  It CAN happen with Summoner Wars, though.  This fantastic card game gives you the same feel of moving your units across the table to vanquish your foes, but with a deck of cards.  You almost have to try it to believe me that it feels like a full minis game.  The artwork could be better, but it does its job evoking the theme and setting the tone.  Tons of replayability in the future with deck-building aspects and new factions.  Another MUST HAVE for anyone who enjoys a tactical fantasy battle.

The luck seems to be fairly manageable, and there's good support for tactical play.  The 4 player game seems like more epic and a lot of fun (only played half of a 4 player game so far) and looks like it introduces more strategic elements, which is nice.

7.5 -- initial rating, but I suspect this will go up with more plays and understanding. There is a LOT of gameplay in these little boxes/decks. Great price point too.

Yep...updated to a 9.

Summoner Wars pedigree clearly traces its roots back to miniatures gameplay (i.e. Heroscape), but uses cardstock on a grid instead of actual minis.

It's a fantastic game that's derivative in several aspects (skirmish combat, deck building/army building, the concept of common and unique units) yet comes together as something wholly different. If I wasn't all-in on Heroscape already, then this would be my gaming drug of choice. 

Normally I'd recommend Heroscape above other similar games, but that's only if you have the disposable income necessary to pursue a discontinued game that's only going to become more expensive and harder to come by over time. That is not to say Summoner Wars is some kind of Heroscape clone, no where near, but it can scratch a similar itch. If your collection is devoid of any kind of miniatures game or you haven't found a skirmish combat game that has yet to captivate your attention, do yourself a favor and try to get ahold of one of the two-faction starter sets or the six-faction master set.

You want an easy to explain, tactical fighting game for two players? Try Summoner Wars!

You want to discover some cool card combos and fierce hand management? Try Summoner Wars!

You value replayability in a game? Try Summoner Wars!

You like your games to be full of tension and tough decisions? Try Summoner Wars!

You like asymmetric but balanced races that play very different from each other? Try Summoner Wars!

You do like risk management and tough decisions in a game? Try Summoner Wars.

I could continue this list for forever. After I first read about Summoner Wars, I knew that I wanted to have it. Come on, who wouldn't fall for different fractions that fight against each other? Coupled with cool card combos and a not too long playing time, this sounded like a hit to me.
Now, after buying and playing this game, I have to congratulate my gut feeling: Summoner Wars is plain fun. Each turn you are faced with a lot of interesting decisions. Do I keep this card or do I use it as magic? Can I attack this guy over there or will the odds be against me?
Normally, I'm not a really big fan of dice as a method for combat resolution, but here they work. Every attack needs to be weighted. Is it worth risking my unit or can I put it to a better use? Even if I do have a bad dice roll, I don't mind it too much. Because there are a lot of them, bad luck seems to hit the players equally.
What I really like about this game is the fact that I haven't played two games that where the same. Some game are a mad ebb and flow of attacks and counter attacks. Some games see one player attacking while the other desperately fights for survival. In other games, everything falls into place and one player surprises you with great combos and a perfect use of his faction abilities.
To sum it up: Summoner Wars is just great. Two thumbs up for it!

I love the game, so much so that I have two of everything for deck building purposes. The game is kind of a mix or Magic the Gathering and Heroscape. The best part is while customization is a part of the game it isn't the focus so new players can easily get into it since none of the base decks are bad by any means.

RATING: 8
Only played this online, but it's a fun little skirmish game.  Players play a fantasy faction - elves, dwarves, orcs, etc, and must summon unit cards onto a six by eight space game board.  Units can be commons (cheap), champions (expensive), events or walls.  Units can only appear adjacent to walls, which also act as blocking pieces.  The object is to skirmish your way to your opponent's Summoner unit (think King in chess) and knock him off.  Combat is simple dice based stuff.  The appeal here is it's fast, simple, and rather addictive.  The designer has cleverly tapped into the Blue Moon/Yomi mindset, giving each faction their own playing style and feel, so the deeper you delve into this, the more rewarding it becomes.  Enjoying the journey so far.

The game hits a nice mix of strategy and risk-taking. Often you'll have very difficult decisions to make that will have a significant impact on the outcome of the game, but you can't always count on getting all the dice rolls you need. The asymmetric factions are really well designed and provide huge replayability, as the different faction matchups play out very differently. Also, the thematic designs for many of the factions are very cool. Normally in thematic games I'm drawn to a specific faction or thematic style, but for this game, there are many factions that really hit the spot for me. In fact, all of the factions have at least something interesting about them that makes you want to give them a try. Achieving such variety while maintaining balance and consistent appeal is probably the most impressive aspect of Summoner Wars.

This might deserve some replay, but initial playing was a slog. Move units, throw dice, ding some goblins, whittle each other down until the bitter end. Reaching the bitter end just took too long to be fun.

Fantasy combat between various factions, such as the fiery Phoenix Elves versus the undead Fallen Kingdom.  Units are represented by cards which maneuver on a grid, lending an almost chess-like feel in between the dice and spellcasting.  The simple rules, wide variety of factions, and customization options make for a quick, fun fight which feels different every time.

My favourite game right now. 
Combines the best aspects of a miniature games and trading card games. 
Plays strategic, yet fast and entertaining.
Quick to teach, hard to master.
Allows for deckbuilding, but doesn't burden you with it.
Has really different, asymmetric factions, with unique theme and feel, which offer much to explore.
Allows lucky results which can entertain and frustrate, but overall favours supreme tactical thinking.
The designers keep the (meta?-) game ever evolving and fresh, without overpowering newer cards.

What not to love about summoner wars?!?

Great!  Indie game makes good!  Simple, deep, expandable, compelling.  Each side plays differently.  I absolutely adore this game; it plays with casual gamers and hardcore equally well.  Hand management and timing the burn through your deck is equally (or more) important than the actually strategy on the board, yet of course each informs the other dynamically.  Everything this game does is obvious, but only in retrospect -- a mark of a great game in my book.  I'm on board for everything that comes out for this.  Here's my wallet, Colby.

RATING: 6
The first thing I think about when I play Summoner Wars is a simplistic PvP version Final Fantasy Tactics played with cards in a confined space with fragile units.  Beyond that, at the time of writing this, there are currently 6 available factions with more on the way.  Not only is there a variety due to the number different match-ups but each faction plays very differently (ala Blue Moon).  Variety will also be increased by the future release of reinforcement decks that allow you to customize the various factions decks with alternating faction cards or the neutral mercenaries.  I think one of the best things about it is that it's not a CCG, each of the specific expansion packs have the same cards included so you always know what you're buying.

I think this is a decent little tactical combat game that plays quickly and has a great amount of variety.  The paper map included is also not as bad as everyone makes it out to be.   As for issues, I find the game to be a little random when it comes to the dice rolls and order in which people draw cards from their deck.  Someone drawing 2 or 3 of their Champions from their opening hand are clearly at a disadvantage.  As is someone who doesn't draw any walls until late game.  Finally, I think each expansion should include the maximum number of cards that can be used for deck building.  Right now if you want a 'play set' of Summoner Wars, you'll have to buy multiple starter sets.  The decks are very well balanced without alteration, but if a selling point is going to be customization then you should include everything in the one box that you need (10 copies of each unique common, 1 copy of each champion, etc, etc).  Even FFG has moved to including maximum number of cards for each unique card with their LCG format.  I would also have to say that limited promo's suck unless you can actually get your hands on them, but overall I wish companies would move away from that.  

Production issues kind of annoyed me: different printings had different sized cards.  Also, they had an odd size of card that didn't fit many normal sleeves.  Another nitpick is the board... when playing with sleeved cards it's easy to knock cards about when moving them around being that the slot sizes on the map aren't as big as they should ideally be.

One game play mechanism that annoys me in some of the earlier factions is the come-from behind mechanisms that often could lead to people killing their own units.  If you kill your own units you even still get the unit in your magic pile.  Losing to win (see Gosu) has never been very appealing to me.

It's still pretty good.  Go play Summoner Wars.

Please note: This was written when I had the the initial 2 starter decks and first two faction packs. Since these releases, a number of things have changed: If you get one of the Master Sets, you will have a much better board. From the Second Summoner sets and onward, the card abilities have become more complex and have no catch-up events. Killing your own units can still be beneficial however.

Perhaps this just came out at the right time and then everyone put it down in favor of other better games without updating their ratings.  Here are the downsides:
 - unbalanced cards
 - unbalanced racial abilities
 - some heroes are just useless for their cost
 - moving and archery are clunky, there is no proper way to balance given the square grid board.
on the upside, I guess it is an interesting asymmetric fantasy theme, I really want to like it...

Summoner Wars is hands down one of the best two player games out there. The faction design is so tight, and so creative. You can deckbuild but you certainly don't have to in order to enjoy the game. It's mechanics are very thematic and the rules are written superbly with very responsive playtesters to answer any questions. I'd never turn down a game. Probably my most played game. Edit: 2015- Didn't like the design of the factions in Alliances. Hope it's not a portent of things to come.

After playing the iOS version just a few times, I knew an actual, physical copy of SW would become a "must-have". It's a hand management game that's also a lighter HeroScape. Thanks to my expansion addiction, I've already managed a complete collection of the first "wave". I'm not sure I'm committed enough to want to collect the Second Summoners as well. (UPDATE: it appears that decision has been made for me. So it goes.)

Best plays have been on vacation with six decks, dice, tokens, and the paper map stuffed in the small 8*8 inch box. The components melt away as you get totally absorbed in head to head battle.

Summoner Wars is certainly a game that one would do better with multiple plays. Knowing the different factions is a definite advantage. Regardless, it's just a fun game overall with simple combat but interesting ways with how factions interact. Also, the hand management aspect is very good as well and creates a nice amount of tension. Luck can have a bit too much to say when it comes to combat, but enough savvy control over units can diminish the luck. No different than any other straightforward dice-driven combat. Sorta has a tinge of Blue Moon to it. Nothing really bad to say about SW- it's a nice game!

Love this game so much. The only think that you're sure in attacking is to miss! The luck is if you do damage.

Seems to be a mix of Neuroshima Hex (cards/tokens used as units in an anrmy), Zombiaki (moving on a grid) and Heroscape (unit statistics and special abilities) with a touch of Magic The Gathering (summoning creatures and spells to fight). I'm not sure yet if it differs from those game enough to keep it in my collection. If there's some satisfying option of deck building that would be a strong argument for keeping it. Otherwise I can see myself getting bored with it pretty quickly.

Pros of this game: small and easy to carry, cool unit abilities, quite a lot of tactical thinking, clean design, seems to be the best substitute for MtG. Also it seems to be less random than I feared it would be (card draw + dice).

---------------------------

After a couple of games I find Summoner Wars to be a very good, satisfying game and I'm planing on buying all of the expansions as soon as possible.

Keeps getting better as we play it.

Not everyone loves it. My fiancee has a great time with it, and she's not a major gamer.
But my regular game group was split on it. Out of four other guys, two of them liked it a lot, two of them thought it was a dice-fest.

I'm not claiming that luck plays no role here, but TRUST me that this game is all about strategy. Once you realize you don't always HAVE to summon every monster in your hand, and that you can afford to sometimes wait a turn without major attacks, the game really starts opening up.

I'm getting all the expansions. Try this game out!

UPDATE
My wife is VERY frustrated with the dice rolling. She's lost a few games she should have won because of a run of bad luck at the end.
I still love the game, and can't wait to try race customization with the expansions. But if you can't handle the luck, don't show up for this one.

UPDATE 2
I guess I'm  a sore loser, because I've been getting beaten more often, and now I pull out the game to play it less and less.

Summoner Wars is a two-player battle game that combines elements of a tactical miniatures game with elements of a customizable card game. The rules are very streamlined, and the game can be learned in about ten minutes.

Within this simple framework, Summoner Wars allows a surprisingly high level of tactical and strategic play. The players are constantly presented with non-obvious choices about when and where and how to play their cards, how quickly to speed through their decks (you don't get to reshuffle!), how aggressively to play, and how best to maneuver and strike on the game board. Some claim the game has a chess-like feel. I think that's an exaggeration, but the fact that people would even make that comparison shows that there's a great deal of sophistication to the positioning and maneuvering of your forces.

Most of the cards in your deck are either units that are placed onto the board or events that give you some sort of bonus/power for the turn. The units themselves each have a special ability (or sometimes a disability) that breaks the normal rules of the game. All of these cards, whether units or events, can either be played in the usual way or can be added to your Magic Pile. Defeated enemy units also are added to your Magic Pile.

In order to summon most units onto the battlefield, you must pay magic by removing one or more cards from your Magic Pile. You will not earn enough magic simply by defeating enemy units. You'll need to play some of the cards in your hand to your Magic Pile in order to field an effective army. It's always a difficult decision, because you'll never be able to play the cards you sacrifice to your Magic Pile.

The customizable aspects of the game are purely optional. Each of the faction decks (16 and counting) plays very well in its standard configuration. Think of the reinforcement packs as expansion options for those who play the game frequently.

Chess evolved. Brilliant design, strategy and luck grapple with your agonizing choices in a game so perfectly sculpted and balanced that Michelangelo might have envisioned freeing it from inside a marble slab.

Okay, that's an odd reference, but it's supposed to be high praise, and I think this game deserves it. 
BUT - I wonder why I don't play it more?
  
Takes too long? 
Yeah, maybe.
 
Too many factions to choose from now that you've bought all the expansions?
Possibly.

I wonder about some of the design choices. Why not include a plastic wall to place on the board when you play a card that let's you put up - A WALL?  Why not have minis on the board instead of flat, 2-dimensional cards?  I think Plaid Hat missed out on the fact that people like tangible stuff, like the tactile sensation of picking up a chess piece, agonizing over it's new placement as you leave your index finger pressed down on it with more force than you intended, taking another minute to asses the battle field before you release the move, and then instantly recognize YOU SCREWED UP! 
But that's okay in this game, because it might be the case that your opponent sucks at dice rolls. The mistakes you make with strategy might be mitigated with your opponents crappy luck. That's the balance I was talking about earlier. Your strategy had better be good, because the luck in this game is based on die rolls. Some people have a love/HATE relationship with dice games, which, similar to mine, is that we love dice games, but HATE bad rolls.

That's what makes this game brilliant. You WILL agonize over using a card to build up your magic, instead of using it to attack your enemy. Where and when you summon your creatures on the board will also leave you biting your nails, because when it comes down to a lucky die roll, you know that die is going to jump off the table and stab you in the back.
Even though I don't play this game anymore, I should. And I should be using it to teach new players what this generation of board and card games has to offer, because SUMMONER WARS is that kind of game.

Only a second time my gut feeling told me that a game was a winner: for Race in the Galaxy. I'll never regret the decision to buy it, and to this day, with more than 100 games under my belt it is still a keeper. 

SO, this is one such game (I only played the Orcs vs Elves). I want to play again!

More often, a comparison to Magic: the Gathering and miniatures based gaming is made here, but I see this as a modern twist on Chess (the first miniatures game?).  Sure, there's too much luck involved for it to be directly related, but the gameplay is similar in that 2 players are moving pawns around with various abilities with the sole objective to capture the other players "king/summoner".  All the different armies seem very well balanced against any other and with the upcoming release of the reinforcement packs, players will be able to customize their armies for an even more satisfying game experience.

I've got the two base sets plus Cloak and Jungle Elves faction decks and some reinforcements and so far I have found the factions to be well balanced and different enough to really get a different type of experience when either playing or playing against them. I look forward to the master set coming out soon so I can check out the 6 new factions. From the previews and discussions at Summonerwars.com, the new factions look to offer even more variety in play styles and strategy.

RATING: 8
As others have suggested, Summoner Wars is akin to Magic: the Gathering, in that you summon monsters to the field of play with mana. However, it has the strategic elements of a Chess game as you position your summons and distribute damage among them. Finally, event cards can be used to turn the tide of a particular skirmish.

Each race possesses play mechanics that not only distinguish it from the other 15 armies, but also seem to match the characteristic feel of that race. Some armies require more finesse, while others require an emboldened attack approach.

The turn structure and preconstructed decks seem to favor balance. With the comparatively cheap model of collection to Magic: the Gathering, it's no wonder why many card game players are flocking to Summoner Wars!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Poor card game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
When Summoner Wars first came out, I liked the game, though the paper map was a real turnoff for me. I was never a fan of the expansion packs that simply added to existing factions since, as previously discussed, I don't much like sitting around constructing decks/armies. Fortunately, Summoner Wars plays extremely well right out of the box. 

The basic concept is that each player has an army made up of cards that move around the board. It almost feels like a miniatures game on a hex map, except it’s the cards themselves that move around on card-shaped spaces. Not all cards are units; some of them are spells that can be played for immediate effect. 

One of the really brilliant things about this system is how the deck is used. Not only does it contain your units and spells, it is also a source of currency used to bring them into play. Cards from your hand can be placed into your Magic Pile which is used to pay the summoning costs of your units. Since you refill your hand to 5 at the end of each turn, it's tempting to build a ton of magic. However, your deck is razor thin, and if you do this, a few rounds in you will have a full magic pile and no cards left in your deck to spend it on. The balance this requires of you is difficult to do properly, and in fact there may not be a "right answer" in most situations, so it really requires intuition rather than brain-burning calculation.

The second thing that really amazes me about this system is that the different factions are stunningly well-balanced and yet each requires a totally different style of play. The genius of this game is how it takes a simple system and lets all the complexity and interaction flow from the cards themselves.

If Summoner Wars has one flaw, it is simply that it's really only a 2-player game. There is a 4-player option in the rules and it simply doesn't work very well. A true minis game has a lot more ways to accommodate teams or odd numbers of players, whereas SW is simply limited by its maps and starting setups. They are a necessary evil to achieve the incredible balance of one faction against another, but it does sometimes make me wish a "battle royale" was a more practical option.

This is excellent. I really like the pace of change in this game. There is enough continuity round to round to allow you to plan ahead, and enough change on the map to force you to improvise. There isn't too much variety in the decks to make it too difficult to remember roughly what you can expect from your deck. But there is enough variety in your deck to give you some difficulty as you try to make most of the order in which you get cards. The dice rolling in this game is awesome. Improbable rolls (1-2 on a d6) happen frequently enough to add to the game dynamics some moments of genuinely unexpected pleasure or pain as the case may be. I really like the colour and graphic design on the cards (and I am very grateful that the stats are so easy to see). I am less keen on the artwork.

This is really like a game I designed when I was 12 (except that mine was Star Wars themed of course), redone by someone who knows how to design games.
The basic game structure is so simple that a kid could have designed it, while the cards add a layer of complexity that makes this game so interesting.  You DO NOT have to understand the decks to have fun, however! 
I love the art, too; yes on some cards it could be better, but I like the style consistency and some of them are really beautiful.

I really wanted to like this one, but the cramped strategic scope (movement is very limited) and questionable thematic strategies (killing your own troops so you get the magic point) didn't make me love this game..

The races are good, but there are rather limited options for modifications. I understand they've done that for balance purposes.. but i rather had less factions and more variability with deck building.

It's not bad, it's just that i'm a wargamer, and if it's a wargame i'm playing, i need the feel of a war, not of chess with dice.

A simple miniatures wargame with the miniatures replaced by cards. The paper board is a bit of a letdown, if the idea was to save money it could have been replaced by a grid of cards. There's some flavour in the different decks and the challenge is to get enough magic to summon your champions, but in the end the game comes down to a few crucial die rolls.

This game is brilliant. The balance between engaging in conflict on the board and determining how to manage the units in your hand leads to some delicious moments of critical choices. The game is very simple to learn but the possibilities of strategy are endless. SW manages to satisfy so many elements that I enjoy about board games: tactical combat, hand management, card driven play, rich theme, gorgeous art, a balance of luck and skill, high versatility, and if you want to, deck building. As someone who used to love Fire Emblem, FF Tactics, and Advance Wars,  SW hits that sweet spot I never thought I'd see in tabletop format. The theme of the various factions runs through their artwork and play style in an impressive way. This game quickly shot up to the top of my list as the best 2P game on the market.

RATING: 8
El concepto básico es que cada jugador tiene un ejército formado por cartas que se desplaza por un tablero. Parece un juego de miniaturas comprimido con la excepción de que aquí, los espacios no se miden con reglas sino que están encuadrados en casillas del tamaño de las cartas. No todo el mazo está compuesto por unidades, sino que hay cartas de magia en él.

La idea más brillante del diseño es la forma de usar el mazo. Las cartas de tu mano se pueden depositar en la pila de magia (la "moneda" del juego) que se usará para invocar nuevas unidades o realizar conjuros mágicos. Este concepto es la parte más "euro" del sistema.

Sin embargo esto es una espada de doble filo, porque si te dedicas a crear una pila de magia, tras unos turnos comprobarás que apenas tendrás unidades que invocar y viceversa.

Otro aspecto que me encanta es lo sorprendentemente bien equilibradas que están las diferentes facciones del juego

PROS: Sin tiradas interminables de dados, sin medir con reglas los alcances, sin pintar miniaturas. Un juego de batallitas que se juega en 60 min. que encanta a mis hijos. Rejugabilidad prácticamente infinita.

CONS: Aunque el juego dice que es para 2 ó 4 jugadores, no funciona bien con más de 2. Un verdadero juego de miniaturas tendría otras opciones, con escenarios diferentes, objetivos distintos, más equipos, más opciones para defensa y ataque... SW se queda corto en todos estos aspectos. El juego original está en inglés. Hay que traducirlo. Nada que tiempo, GIMP y un buen nivel de inglés impidan. Dependiente del azar y con cierta tendencia al tortugueo (=actitud defensiva hasta desgastar al enemigo)

A very good little card game for 2 players, it felt like a better "Battle for Hill 218" to me and was fun to play.

RATING: 8
A game that seems so (apparently) straightforward in its smooth tactical excellence, that you wonder why it wasn't developed years earlier. Chess meets warrior-summoning resource management, plus special powers and dice. My only reservation is that the middle battlefield area can become a bit clogged (although as I improve at the game, this clogging seems to reduce), whilst delivering the final kill-shot to the other player's summoner is sometimes a little drawn out. Otherwise, a superb card based battle game, which has plenty of fans among new and seasoned gamers.

Wow. This game sat on my shelf for months. I bought it because I had money to spend to get to free shipping. I even bought the extra faction decks and the premium board. Months pass. Finally I break it out and read the rules. Thats it for the whole game? Simple. Played one game. Oh my goodness. Only three commons and three champions and a summoner. The choices, to move to battle to do anything. Wow. Hooked. Now I own all the factions, plus the reinforcements, the Master Set and any future factions will be bought. Bring them on. It amazes me how many times I see a win or a win is pointed out to me and then somehow on my next turn if I am still around I have lucked out and do what I saw or my opponent just told me. I play way to aggressive but I can only play one game a day most times because this game ties up my nerves. I seldom have a game where I dominate, usually I hang on by the edge of my teeth and pull off a win. Dice are not my friends. I once attack my opponent summoner. I hit 3 out of 10 die rolls. 30% hit ratio. I won much later but the dice show me no love. Go Cloaks.

Game is less successful when it comes to allocating the burden to attack and in many match ups, the defender can deliver a powerful backhand blow, promoting inaction.

Entertaining enough, but hardly a world-shaking 10 as many have given it. Without the premium board, I'd give this a 5 both for aesthetics and sheer playability; with, I'll bump it up to a gentleman's 7. The artwork is uninspiring and the initial factions play too much to type to be that interesting. Expansions look a little better. Gameplay should become faster with repeated plays and better deck knowledge, but I think it could still probably push to 40-50 minutes, which is borderline too long for what's going on here. The rules are pretty clear, although there are at least some holes in the card text, and things could be a bit terser all around on the cards.

An extremely basic minis game except with cards. Nothing clever or original here, just roll dice and hope to hit.

Good, quick playing tactical game of fantasy warfare using player decks of cards and a map for armies. Low unit density and variable unit powers and stats.Four factions available (at present) whci are quite different in their strengths but seem to be pretty equal in their overall ability to win.

It is a great game but the meta dictates that this game can only be played in a turtling fashion. Being aggressive = instant death because of all those nasty catch-up events. I hope the addition of the second summoner can change it. Given the price point and the game in the box though, it is a game that I would suggest people to buy as their first non-gateway purchase.

This is a tactical deep two player duelling game with a board. The Board and positioning is a key aspect to the strategies in this game, and every faction feels different. The choices of which cards you use and which you turn to magic points makes this a high skill intensive game.

Summoner Wars is one of the best games out there.  I don't know if there is another game in my large collection that is quite as satisfying as Summoner Wars.  Maybe Twilight Struggle.  It has a bit of everything: it's addictive, it's immersive, it's fast-paced, it's ever-growing and expansive and customizable...each element is carefully balanced.  I am not a huge fan of 3 and 4 players, but as a head-to-head match, there is probably nothing better out there.  It delivers the same satisfaction of other, heavier games without the hassle of a lengthy set-up or drawn-out battle.  I never turn down an opportunity to play!

As an added bonus, the publisher/designer is very approachable, the customer support is great, and the set is constantly expanding.

This one is a must have.

I go back and forth on this one. On the one hand I love the balance among the races and that it seems like any race can beat any other but will require a radical change in strategy. On the other hand it always seems to take a bit too long and be rather AP prone. I want the game to play fast (in approx 30 min), but if I play it that fast I feel like I'm not taking the time to explore my options. But if I explore my options it wears out it's welcome. A catch-22 for me.

Played twice, 2p; pre-made Elves vs. Orcs.  I really do not understand one bit of the love this game gets.  I hate to say it, but it is dominated by randomness.  First, there's the luck of the draw.  Did you draw better cards than me?  Or the right card at the right time?  You win!  Then, there's the luck of the dice.  No matter the brilliance of a players maneuvering, bad luck with the dice means you get nothing done.  And the opposite can obviously happen.  Plus, how much you can do depends DIRECTLY on how well the dice work for you (the number of enemy units you destroy determines your ability to summon new units to your side).  Maybe the deck building aspect of the game dominates the strategy.  Maybe more than 2 players is required for fun.  I don't know, and I probably won't bother finding out.

RATING: 4
I was intrigued by this game, but I did not find it very interesting.

First, I have never see a good tactical battle game using an octagonal board. The only best game I recall are video games which are advanced wars and Final Fantasy tactics. So the map layout is first not very interesting to me.

Second, you always lack of resources. I am always short in mana to summon anything, and there is a card limit to the game, you have many limits and I find this very annoying.

Third, 80 of the units in the deck make you roll 1 or 2 dice. So you are wondering why they are not using the nb of dice more often. I would have expected that all units have different combat levels.

The turn order is also very weird, I am used to duel masters where you first place you mana, then you cast. In this game, you cast first and place mana at the end. But you don't know what you are going to draw, so you do not know the mana you will need.

It's not an horrible game, it just do not attract me.

I have played a lot of Summoner Wars on the app, and recently played my first game in real life so I felt a review was finally in order. Summoner Wars is a tactical card game played out over a grid between two players. Each player has a faction with its own strength and weaknesses. Play is extremely simple and can be explain to a new player in about five minutes before they can be up and running. The strength of the game lies in the variances between the factions and how each must use those differences to their most advantageous each game to win. I have only seen three different factions in action, but I can attest that each plays very uniquely. There is some randomness as combat between units is decided with a roll of a die, or dice. Clever play is rewarded throughout the game as different possible strategies emerge. The component quality is okay, and the art is just so-so. Overall the game is a solid entry into the tactical combat genre.

This looks very interesting.  It almost looks like a tactical version of Blue Moon, which we really like, particularly in the way that simple cards for each race can feel so different from each other.  The game looks like it's chock full of specialized cards and tough hand management, which we always enjoy.  On the other hand, I have no idea where to start (or end)...

This felt dated. It's a chess/checkers variant that was using variability as it's attempted hook.  It gets bogged down in it's spacial aspects to me.

That hook just wasn't baited enough for me.

The first and so far only game was a bit disappointing - we slogged through the whole of our decks and had to play it out to the bitter end, with not a lot of interesting decisions towards the final.

I guess, however, that this was a mixture of bad luck and beginner's mistakes, and since there are several bright ídeas here (fueling your summoning magic with the blood of your enemies, for example), I hope to try this again soon to rectify my first impression.

UPDATE:
Second game with different factions was as lacklustre towards the end as the first one, so Summoner Wars is now officially a dud. I'd rather play another 300 games of Vortex before I'll play one more game of this.

I had high expectations for this game. Tom Vasel,Rodney Smith and several other reviewers praised this game. I got the impression Summoner Wars might be a nice cheap alternative to MtG. It had a lot of interesting elements on paper such as game board and positioning units, wide variety of different factions and ability to customize your deck sounded very interesting. 

I think I would have loved this game couple of years ago when I got into boardgaming. Unfortunately at this pint Summoner Wars just fell flat for me and my friends. The simple mechanics are easy to learn, but they lead to disappointing and repetitive gameplay. 

I tried to watch some reviews again to see what draws people into this game. I noticed several people told they play this with their children. I can imagine it can raise points for most parents as they are able to bond with their children and lead them into their own hobby. I don't have children so I don't really see a reason to play this game. I must admit this could be a better gateway game than MtG to lure children into this hobby.

I love Summoner Wars, the different factions and how they all differ in play from one another allows for variety and replay ability. Learn how to use each deck, it's ups and downs.

If you take it for what it is and put yourself into the game a little bit, it is hard not to have fun.

- Battles can get tense

What I don't like:
- Low life points and low strength can lead to a lot of disappointing rolls.
- There are very few characters with abilities that let you reduce the luck of the roll.
- A lot of factions that I didn't like, and not enough factions I liked to be worth keeping.

An excellent game.  

Very simple rules, great looking cards, balanced armies, quite affordable, with great support.

I have played many games over the past few months with every race available (except for Phoenix Elves, whom I refuse to play).  All the armies thus far seem very balanced, and are fun to play as each one is a bit different.

The rules are simple, and the games are short.  I have had games last 5 minutes (quick attack by Goblins with the right cards), and some as long as half an hour.

The game plays a bit like a tactical tabletop war game, minus the miniatures, and terrain.  Usually I prefer games with tons of miniatures, etc., but SW works for me.  It also seems a bit like chess, with a lot more complexity, obviously.

Since the game only uses cards, it is very affordable, and better yet, very portable.  I can bring it with me to work in my suitcase, and play wherever I want after I'm done.

The system also has a nice hand management \ magic \ resource mechanism that makes the game a bit different from a standard tabletop war game.  It's a nice blend of Magic The Gathering (and other card games), and straight up table top combat.

There are also a ton of new expansion packs coming out, so there will be a ton of units \ armies available, which is a great thing.  Sure, if you buy them all the cost will add up, but you don't HAVE to buy them all (although being an addict myself, I will most likely end up buying everything).  

My only concern is, down the line, with so many new armies \ cards coming out, some things might become unbalanced, but that is hard to predict, and probably will not happen.

This game will appeal to a lot of people I think, as most of my friends, and even my wife, really took a liking to it (which is not an easy task).  At the very least you can pick up one of the starter packs (for around 20$), and give it a shot.

I recommend this game to people who like quick easy games, are looking for a portable game, like chess, hand \ card management games, tactical war games, and \ or a mix of any of the above.

I like this one a lot.  My usual 2-player-game opponent found it too random, though, so it's not likely to see a lot of table time until I can scare up another player for it.  Pity.

You may look at the upcoming cards that you will draw next turn to speed up gameplay. Keep them separate in case of an event.

Probably my favorite tactical skirmish game. I love how incredibly different every race is, yet how they remain so balanced. I haven't gotten much into deck building (so no reinforcements), but I do have almost all existing base decks, including second summoners.

Great theme, good game, lots of variety with the different factions, well priced and the perfect length for what it is.

I'm not in love with the mechanics, which is why I give it a '7' (upgraded from original 6) and think of it as an occasional rather than frequent game. But it's a fantasy game with a good mix of luck and skill that plays fast and is easy to teach, so it fills a nice niche in my collection. I can get this to the table pretty easily. And with the wealth of factions available, you can't argue with the value you get, especially from the Master Set.

This is a fantastic card game to play 1v1.  It has deck building if you want but just using the predefined decks is great too.  It's pretty easy to teach, is well balanced and has lots of interesting decks to choose from that play quite differently.

For a more complicated 1v1 game I would recommend Mage Wars Academy or Mage Wars Arena but they require a lot more time to learn and deck build. And in the case of Mage Wars Arena, a lot longer to play.

The game is branded as a wargame but actions are so unpredictable (reinforcing in the middle of the battlefield every turn!) that any long term strategies are almost impossible. It feels like you're trying to swim through piranhas and then finally trying to kill a big bad shark. It's a more of a hack and slash than a wargame.

A small-scale tactical miniatures game without the miniatures.  Not having played minis games before I don't have a background on how to judge it, but the idea comes across pretty clearly.

I didn't like the gameplay as much as the art, but I didn't dislike it either. It's quick and easy, so it can still fit a niche in most collections. (Games to play with tween boys) I'd like to play with each of the decks, get a feel for the differences, which are certainly more intuitive than in [gameid=21241]. Sustained interest is probably contingent on enjoying those differences enough to buy more decks.

So I have owned this game (elves vs. orcs) for about 5 months now, and recently began playing with the expansions decks Fallen Kingdom & Vanguard.  I am going to order the board after the Christmas rush, because the paper mat is rubbish, and does not fold flat, so the cards can slide around.  Apart from that,the game just plays really nicely.  Quality components (apart from that infernal paper mat), strategy, luck, good pacing and tight gameplay.  My only complaint is that I wish I had more people to play against.  But I have been known to play against myself! Looks like lots more interesting product in the pipeline as well, make this game a must buy.  The everything fits into such a small package is hust icing on the cake.

RATING: 10
This game hits the mark everywhere for me:

Variety/Asymetry: Many teams with unique feels.  Unique advantages for all are a blast.

Thematic: Good marriage between theme and mechanics.  The fantasy theme isn't my favorite, but they pull it off well.  And that's more important than it being ones favorite theme.

Tactics/Strategy: More Tactical about optimizing each turn with what you have, with Strategic risk/reward.

Resource Management: The "Euro" side of this game is how you manage your magic.  Very vital to victory.

Spatial: Positioning is probably the hugest part of the game.  The board is big enough and tight enough... the perfect size, to make this such a rewarding blast.  My favorite part of the game.

Tide changing: If you are being beaten down, you can plan well and get back on your feet.  Few games I've played are 100% 1 sided... usually there are a few back and forths of which side is winning.

Time: Short enough to not be a turn off, or to play a few games in a row.  Long enough to deliver depth.

Excitement: From the perspective of a "dice hater), I can say this is a rare circumstance where they "work"!  With the majority of dice being success, you can plan, but are never 100% certain.  This creates good tension without too much "ripped off" feeling from rolls.  It's not like other games where you roll and roll and most dice are fail.  Dice game designers must really like dice, because they tend to design a game to require tons of rolling (mostly because of misses, and combat not ending with 1 set of dice rolling).  This game is one of the 1% that do dice well.  Wish others would learn from this.

Smooth: No tedious dice rolling.  No ruler measuring and judgement calls.  Good technical writing leaves no room for rules interpretation (if you are good at interpreting precise rules, which is surprisingly hard to do without assumptions biasing you the wrong way... no the games fault, they did it just right).  Simple to explain rules with lots of depth for skill.

I love this game so completely.  Once of the few leaving nothing else to be desired.  This is my favorite game by no small amount.  My 2nd-10th favorite games are probably pretty close, but Summoner Wars far outshines everything for my personal tastes.

RATING: 8
I own both starter sets: fun game, all fractions need to be played differently, knowledge of your own and opponents strengths and weakenesses is crucial. And a fraction deck is small enough to learn all the cards after 1 play with that deck, which is great. Because after that you can dive into the depth of the game.

Dwarves: slow down the game, destroy walls, exhaust the enemy

Elfs: keep distance, attack and retreat

Goblin: Build up, shock and awe

Orcs: Be uuuhm lucky?

I like the build magic phase, reminds me somehow of race for the galaxy: pay for cards with cards and with that the decision: keep a card to build it in a later turn or use it as "money"  

Looking forward to play a 4 player game

Update: game can drag on a bit when both players depleted their draw pile.

Play and move cards and roll combat dice to destroy your opponent's summoner.

Plays: More than a dozen, all on iOS.
Type: Customizable game.
Complexity: Light.
# of players: 2.
Playing time: See BGG.
Player interaction: Conflict.
Randomness: High – card draw and dice.

Replayability: Low. This gets repetitive pretty quick even with expansions. 
Fun: Strangely devoid of fun. I'm not a fan of generic tactical wargames and the fantasy theme isn't inspiring.
Memorability: Low, you move cards and roll dice and then someone wins. Feels empty.

Thematic integration: Good. The art does a good job communicating the theme and the factions feel different.
Components: Meh. The art is bland.

Who will like this: Miniature gamers that want a portable alternative and like the theme.

A smart, smart design, especially from a production perspective- provides some of the punch of a miniatures game for a fraction of the cost. This saw a fair bit of play before it fell out of favor in my groups; I still break it out on the iPad now and then. Some of the factions have impressively realized identities, in my opinion- no small task with such a limited amount of cards.

RATING: 6.5
If you are looking for a tactical miniatures feel, there are better games. The fantasy theme is reasonable bearing in mind this is a very simple game. In fact I love the simplicity. A nice gateway to fantasy combat. The combat system is nice and simple and the main focus need to be on your decisions as to who to summon and when. That's the heart of the game and it works really well and makes this game a worthy purchase.

Update after hundreds of plays:  The replay value only keeps increasing.  I like it even more now than I did at the times of my previous comments (below).  Sequels usually don't live up to the original but surprisingly, the latest factions, the Cloaks and the Jungle Elves, are the best ones yet.

Update after 30 plays:  Summoner Wars is as strong as ever.  Whereas, optimal tactics were my focus early on, I've now improved the hand management portion of my play.  Gameplay is still fresh and fun.  Summoner Wars remains as a 10.

Just got Summoner Wars recently.  As such, I reserve the right to change this initial rating but so far this game is a 10.  Very exciting and balanced.  I love how the gameplay really reflects each faction's personality and theme.

RATING: 7
On a board of 8 rows and 6 columns, players play a faction (goblins, elves, etc), represented by a deck of cards. Each race has an initial setup with a few cards on the board. The goal is to knock off your opponent's summoner. Each card has a summon cost, dice they roll in combat, and special effects, such as ranged attacks. You do have to summon your cards adjacent to a wall that you control, and your deck will have a total of 3 wall cards. 

Combat is resolved with dice, summoning is based on casting cost of the creature. At the end of your turn, you can "build magic" by putting cards into your hand into your magic pile to get more summoning power for next turn. You also get to add the creatures you knock off from your opponent's board to your magic pile. 

It's a fun game, lots of tactics and each deck is unique to give you a feel of the different powers.  I've only played this 2 player, and I'm looking forward to trying all the decks.

Do yourself a favour and pick up the Master Set, or the standalone board available from the publisher.

A very simple skirmish game on a paper grid. Surprisingly original, though. Rating may rise.

Component quality was a nice surprise: The dice are big and heavy, and have properly rounded corners. The damage counters are thick, and putting a "3" behind a "1" is a great idea, since two hits seems to be a very common combat result. The cards are noticeably Chinese, but perfectly serviceable.

I guess I'm just really not into these kind of card duelling games with dice combat thrown in. 
If I had to choose I actually would prefer this one over Mage Wars though as it seems quicker, more straightforward and I actually think the magic pile mechanic is kind of interesting. But overall it's just not the type of game for me, this one is probably the one I'd play from time to time when asked, but I'm not seeing myself really seeking this out.

[b]Summoner Wars[/b] was sold via auction 12/14/14 and reacquired 9/17/17.

[COLOR=#FF0000]Three years later... thoughts and rating (8/10 -> [b]10[/b]):[/COLOR]

[i]Summoner Wars was one of the first games we owned and we played a lot. Eventually I ended up trading it away, but we never found another 2p, head to head game we enjoyed quite as much [i]([thing=178892][/thing] came the closest)[/i]. Almost three years later I ended up investing in the whole SW set since it appears to be slowly going out of print. Getting in 30+ plays inside of 3 months confirms the fact that I never should've gotten rid of this game. There is so much more to explore now that we have all the new decks. We're really enjoying exploring all the new factions different strengths and strategies. We've also done some light deck construction which has also been rewarding. This is a top 10 game for me when listing games to play with my kids. If you have any interest at all in this type of game I'd recommend jumping in now before this becomes an OOP grail game.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8/10):[/COLOR]

[i]*Just a quick note; we tried [thing=167400][/thing] when it came out and we didn't like it nearly as much as SW. If you want more of my thoughts on Ashes you can read my comments on the game.[/i]
[i]- Excellent family game to play with your kids.
- Another 2p gem that plays in about 30 minutes.
- Almost endless replay value due to all the different factions you can play.
- Faction balance even though most factions have very different play styles.
- Rewards repeated play, it definitely helps to know the cards in each deck.
- Lots of dice rolling built into a game that rewards skillful play, most of the time the better player will win.
- However; when playing with less skilled players they can pull off the upset, combat is not deterministic.
- The map really makes this game shine, you have the added component of having to think about movement and placement of your troops on a board. [/i]

The depth of this game is simply phenomenal. It's an easy to learn game that's very fun to play even when you don't yet understand all the possible strategic interactions of the game. It's really well designed and thought through - the stories of the factions are great, the abilities match thematically and the mechanics are just spectacular. It's really fun to play when you're just rolling and attacking each other, but then you learn your factions and start develop combos and learn how to manage your hand and it becomes even more fun. 
I wish event cards would have unique art, that seems like an easy addition.
On a different note, this game really could have been a battlelore style game if it had miniatures and the cards you draw would just be placed on the side of the map. It would be awesome if you like miniatures, but would probably change gameplay considerably.

Based on one play: A fairly light deck driven battle game, where the decks are pre-made (you can modify them slightly). You play on a fixed grid and chose a deck. You can move, attack and cast spells but all in a specific order, thus it is very structured, but leaves room for a lot of strategy within the mechanics. An easily accessible game without the need to purchase booster packs. I will have to play again.

Not really that exciting of a game. I find it really abstracted and I don't really feel like I'm doing anything useful. With card draws and dice rolling, I feel there is too much luck involved.

I own this on the IOS when an everything bundle was on sale. This is a decent move and attack game where the last guy with a "king" unit left is the winner. It is kind of like chess in a sense but you have factions so it is an asymmetric start. It also involves dice to resolve combat kind of like war games in general. Its fun but I am glad I didn't invest in a physical copy.

Despite the love this game gets, I just don't share the same sentiment.  The artwork doesn't stand out to me, the gameplay is too luck-based, and the decks do not at all feel balanced against each other.  This game has fallen flat with everyone I've ever shown it to.

A pretty good game which combines deck management elements like those found in Magic The Gathering with spatial/area movement found in many miniatures war games. Pretty simple game play, which makes it nice for kids/teens. Also can act as a good gateway game for some. I don't really care for the cheap computer generated style art. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
Based on one play of elves vs dwarves.

A light, tactical, back-and-forth game of waiting for your opponent to make a mistake that gives you the upper hand.  Strategy is almost non-existent because you're at the combined mercy of the dice, your card draw, and your opponent's card draw with little opportunity to improve the odds in your favor should Lady Luck turn on you.  

Suspense was nil with most units being killed the turn after being summoned (on both sides), and the ending was anti-climactic.  On the plus side, it's over quickly enough as long as one realizes that this is not a deep game and does not merit much analysis.

I'd be willing to give it another shot to see if the other races offer anything more.  

NOTE: I do not object to dice or cards in general, and I do not mind a bit of luck.  My complaints regarding their use are specific to Summoner Wars.

I like the idea behind the game, and I think tha factions are interesting , and seem balanced.

I ultimitly think I am spoiled by my miniatures games experience though.  When I play a tactical battle game, I am just more accustomed to a more flexible options for attack and defense.

The rules of the game really tend to limit the ways you can approach a battle.  I also think many of the various units tend to be pretty samey.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
A fantastic game. Plays like a miniature skirmish game but without the minis. Easy to teach..lots of strategical choices and a great variety of factions and abilities keeps this one in a regular play rotation. Only drawback is the paper mat that comes with the starter sets but the premium board fixes that problem. Can't wait for more factions and boosters.

A very interesting game that seems to be pretty well balanced amongst the decks.  One of the things that I like about this game is that the order of the turn is set up in such a frustrating manner.  I often want to do something out of sequence, and I appreciate that the design doesn't allow it, because that to me says that it is well thought-out to keep overpowered combinations from happening.

I have all factions and Reinforcements packs, but I'm not interested in deck customization. Decks are already very good and quite balanced as they are.

I also bought two copies of the new, thick board (a bit too expensive.. but very well done).

It manages to not feel dicey, due to the limited number of options each player has, and the relatively high hit percentage. I guess it's still dicey anyway, but enjoyably distills tabletop mini games into an inexpensive, no rules mess game.

The game plays well, good art, quick.

The game is diverse with multiple factions to choose from and different builds within each faction. Beautiful art and cool board. It feels very balanced which is an art just by itself. It is simple, really simple but it has a fair amount of depth and between having limited resources to buy units and having to decide which ones to use to build magic, you have far more decisions beyond the battlefield tactics and strategy. Needless to say it is very thematic and flavorful.

Simple, deep, thematic and fun.

I haven't been sucked in yet like I was hoping, but I've enjoyed the few plays I've had. The confrontational, aggressive nature of the game, coupled with the fact that your units don't last long has had me thinking that my wife may give up on it if she has a really bad couple of turns. So I kind of feel like I'm tiptoeing on eggshells when I play, hoping she won't get too frustrated.

The theme is actually not as strong as I thought it would be. The game feels more mechanical than I would like. It is quite tactical and the factions all seem like they play very differently. 

I'm hoping to get more plays in soon and have more fun than I've had. It's not a bad game, but hopefully my rating will go up.

--Jan2010-- It's pretty clean mechanically.  I found that the game had a nice ebb & flow of story as time passed, but I'm a bit concerned that the 30-minute duration is optimistic.  It wasn't at all clear that the game couldn't go on for much longer than that:  and, frankly, it begins to outlast its welcome at the one hour point.
--Mar2010-- Oops!  We'd been shuffling the discards into the draw deck.  Which, of course, is the reason the game was going on too long.  Much more enthusiastic about the limited-duration (i.e. intended) version.
And sure enough:  with the right end game constraint, there's a very interesting hand management aspect to the game.  The four factions are delightfully different, which leaves a dozen different configurations to be explored.

RATING: 5
Since reading all the hype I decided to sit down and have a few plays of Summoner Wars.

Over the course of 2 evenings I've completed 6 playthroughs of this game using both the orc+elves decks and the dwarf+goblin decks.

I'm unsure whether I'm willing to return for more punishment.

It really really really frustrates me.
The Reasons:
1. Combat is determined by rolls of a single d6. I hate poisson distributions in my dice rolls. The Standard Deviation is too large. Give me a god damn normal distribution for my dice any day. Is it so hard to use a friggin 2d6.

Using a single d6 makes combat extremely luck based. In a game where there are maybe 15 rounds total. Having a poor round or two could easily put you in an irrecoverable position.

2. The factions are unbalanced. Try the elves and you'll see what I mean. In 4 playthroughs with the elves vs. orcs, the elves won easily every single time. They have the best troops (extra range, attack and teleport back, auto damage). They have the best event cards (auto damage, magic drain). And their champions are decent as well. In a game where the dice are so random, having most of your troops and cards not roll dice is pretty friggin sweet. It helps when your opponents get auto-damaged or run shamans as well or have the ridiculous reinforcement card (magic drain is better than this in every way). Stupid orcs.

3. The game punishes attackers. Why move forward and attack when you'll just end up stretching your supply lines thin. If you're familiar with magic then you know about tempo and card advantage. Well since there's no summoning sickness, by moving your troops forward to attack you are trying to control the tempo of the game. However, this falls flat on it's face since your opponent can spawn baddies right next to you and potentially get a huge card advantage by wiping out your beasties with fewer cards.

4. Having such a small deck with few copies of cards can make any clumping of certain types of cards spell disaster. For example, if you get your reinforcement cards at the end of your deck when you don't have and more troops to use them for. Or if you suddenly get a handful of goblin event cards, just as your opponent has cleared the board of gobbos with a quake hammer. Instead of coming back with a rebuttle, you sit on your hands for a second turn. 2 consecutive turns for your opponent will often put you in an unrecoverable position.

I really enjoy card games (eg: magic) and I really enjoy wargames (eg: ASL). This doesn't scratch either of those itches. There aren't enough throws of the dice in the game to obviate the destructive power of a string of a few poor rolls. It really feels like you and your opponent are battling eachother back and forth, wiping out eachothers troops time and time again, until the first person gets some bad luck or some bad draws... then that person looses (maybe not at first, but down the road).

For example, you've just wiped out your opponents monsters and have magic cards lined up for your next turn. Your opponent goes, he plays some monsters and wipes your dudes out. Now he magic drains you twice. Your magic is gone. Your turn you draw cards and discard them to refill your magic pool. Now your opponent occupies strategic board position to prevent you from spawning. Now you go and play some monsters and attack. If you roll poorly now, you loose the game. Thanks for playing.

What a great game. It's a triumph of design in that it feels like about 3 different genres of games, but simultaneously like it's own thing. Really streamlined rules give way to tactical depth and great variety. And the support that Plaid Hat has brought to the game is very admirable. Don't miss this one, you'll enjoy it.

As a side note, pick up both starter sets. The game is even better as a four-player team game.

Each faction has depth to mine through multiple plays.

I dodn't get this game initially - but now I've developed and understood some of the strategies involved, I can see that this is a very nice, deep, tactical and strategic game.

It's all about balencing long-term plans with short term requriements, positioning, and plans of attack/defence. Trading card for card is possible - but is it desirable? Should I destroy that champion, or focus on getting to his summoner? Will this common just build my opponents magic?

Wow, someone finally made the game that is the chess aboard the millennium falcon! Love the grid, love the cards (dislike miniatures), LOVE the different powers of each faction, and love the pre-made decks. So many games are deck-construction games, I get weary. Sometimes I just want to PLAY, y'know? Not to mention the challenge of getting anyone else into a deck construction game, there's so much getting up to speed one has to do. Not here. Slap down a race, get to fightin.

Luck of draw + luck in dice rolls = too much for me. I don't pretend there's no skill involved, but every race does have a fixed feeling to it imposing a style of play, making each game quite similar. Not my style of game.

Surprisingly good game.  Simple to learn with some interesting interactions in the starter decks.  Should be absolutely amazing with some solid expansion.  The components were good but the map was terrible.

However, Thunderstone has supplanted this game in my headspace.

ADD:  Since the Master Set's release and my son's enthusiastic grokking of the game, SW is now our game of choice!

Although the comparison seems strange, like the modern "dudes in a corridor" design, the gamespace in SW provides no inherent tactical interest. I couldn't muster up enthusiasm for the choices the game asks of me.

Summoner Wars is a good 2 player games. The factions play differently, the mechanics are elegant, and the game is fun. The matchups I've played have been pretty well balanced. I like the positional element, the choice between playing a card and building it as magic, and the fact that you run through your whole deck before you lose (unless you screw up in some spectacular fashion). 

One concern is that the luck of the dice can break you. Most attacks hit on 3+, so it doesn't have the problem of many high variance games, but if you can't kill units, you will fall behind on magic as well. Unless this is pronounced, you should be able to mitigate it through careful play, but if you just can't hit anything, you will find yourself in a lot of trouble. 

The main thing holding this game back for me is that I can't help comparing it to Mage Wars, which I think is a vastly superior game if you have the time to really dig into it.

So, I was finally able to download this on the iPhone after their initial launch gaffes.  I had never played before.  It's ok.  I like the whole build magic mechanic.  The game does seem to go on longer than necessary tho, as in you can see who is going to win 5 or 6 turns before it actually happens and you have to go through the motions.  One of the few instances where playing the iPhone version of a game will actually dissuade me from buying the physical copy.  I'll play it again, but I don't feel a burning desire to suggest it.

Honestly, this seems like a great game that I just don't play as much as NS Hex because a) the AI isn't great, b) the AI only has a few decks it can play, and c) I don't often play MP, even async. If I made a concerted effort to do more of that with this and Ascension, it might move up my ranking.

Summoner Wars is my go to for light, tactical skirmish game.

Quite possibly one of the best card games I've played.  You can almost SEE the miniatures out there fighting.  Four players might not be recommended, though, as it takes the game a bit longer than what it should be.  Still, incredible depth with simple rules almost always makes a game great to me.

RATING: 9
Really, really fun. It's fast and involving - you will be captivated the entire game, while the time flys by too quickly. Often, a second game is played after the first is done. It is sort of like a miniatures game played on a grid, but it has a much lighter feel while retaining tactical depth. One thing I like about Summoner Wars is that you dont have to remember so many rules variations stemming from different character powers like you often have to with collectable card games or miniature games. Here, everything you need to know about a troop is written right on the card that represents it. The games mechanics are very smooth and easy to recall after one turn, and there are hard decisions that one has to make (e.g. - do I use these cards for their spawning power, or try to hold on to them for later?). It is somewhat lighter than one may think, but if i'm in the mood for a heavier game that's when something like Battlelore comes out. This one fills a very needed nitch, and scratches the one on one battle itch very nicely.

Really didn't find this compelling at all.  It's difficult to get your units out and hits happen so frequently that units die too quickly for there to be much strategy and also that unlucky rolls can be overly costly.  For simple wargames, Command and Colors or Manouevre really scratches the itch for me.  This doesn't at all.

Players each have their own deck (like in CCGs, but these come ready made and are not collectible). Each player has a main character and a bunch of minions and some spells. The cards are laid out on the board (a grid) in a specific setup defined by each main character. Start with five cards in hand, and a random starting player (handicapped by removing a few options that first turn). Each turn:
1 Draw Cards - up to your hand size (5). Only go through your draw deck once!
2 Summon Units - by spending mana in mana pool, stronger minions costing more mana; they are placed adjacent to the walls on your half of the board.
3 Play Event Cards - by spending mana
4 Move - up to 3 creatures (2 spaces each) orthogonally (but not new ones, which basically have summoning sickness).
5 Attack - up to 3 of your minions (not necessarily the ones moved), adjacent or ranged depending on creature. Combat is a simple die roll: roll a number of d6 based on the attacker type, scoring hits on rolls 3+. Creatures take hits until they reach their maximum (varies); when you kill something, put it face down in your mana pool.
6 Build Magic - place any cards you don't want from your hand into your mana pool.

Play alternates until one Summoner is finally killed.

The mana pool is clever -- that you can add to it by discarding cards you don't like (sort of like some CCGs allow you to play any card face down as a land equivalent) AND by killing enemies, and this is what you use to cast your summoning/attacking spells. So not only is there some strategy and tactics in the board play, but also hand management in having to figure out which cards to use simply as mana (no mana screw as is common in Magic) and which to save to cast later.

I can see that this could be a fun game, but I just don't play 2er games very often -- will need to try the 4 player version. Also, the die rolling, where I seemed to fail nearly every time in my first partial game, isn't my preferred method for combat resolution!

This little gem surprised me.  I really enjoyed playing this.  You and your opponent each set-up unit cards on a grid like battle map.  Each player tries to kill the opponents summoner, you do this by moving and attacking your units.  Each turn you draw your hand up to 5 cards and then play events, summon units and then move and attack, and then you can discard as many cards as you want into your magic pool.  The magic pool element is a brilliant touch that does a very good job at creating interesting decisions and strategies.  Each unit has a summoning cost, you simply burn cards from your magic pool to summon the unit.    The game continues until a summoner is dead, so you can extinguish your deck and have no more cards to cast.  Your strategy may be to burn thorough your deck quickly to cast your powerful units, but if you do you better win quickly or you will stagnate late.  I am exited about playing it again.

The components are above average - unmounted paper board, durable cards with good artwork and a rulebook which is well written.  Game moves along at a good pace, length is good at just over an hour.

[Plaid Hat Games 09 edition] {2p; dice-rolling, hand management}  I bought it based on many good comments about this games.  However, this is not as good as I expected.

Fantasy game is easily to be fun.  Summoning units on the battlefield, moving them around, having some fights, asymmetric races, etc. are fun.  There are some tactics here about which units to summon, where to place/move units, attack which units, etc.  And, it is quite a solid hand management game.  The game length is good: 30-45 minutes. In all, I like to play it occasionally.

The rule is nicely formatted and illustrated but the FAQ is necessary to play this game correctly.  This game can be learnt and mastered fairly quickly.  There are nothing new here - all mechanics can be found before.

Regarding the exapansions, I don't plan to buy the because the game is not really outstanding enough for me to invest so much; unless, some expansions provide novel mechansics and very fun deck-building units.  The basic sets are already enough for several years.

The card illustration is ok.  However, the special power is quite wordy.  It would be better if black dice with red pips are provided.  The game is a little over-priced with the list price.

It has some interesting cardplay, and the tactical part of the game is decent enough. What kills the game for me though, is that almost all of the abilities on units don't add any depth - it's just, oh this unit deals 33% more damage. This unit misses 50% more often. It kind of gets boring fast. 

The sad thing is, I really, really wanted to like this game. It has cards (with real text!) It has tactical combat, it has tempo-oriented resource management. On paper, I should love this game. But I don't. The game just falls flat due to bland card design.

This is fast becoming a "desert island" game for me. Owning perhaps a dozen factions (and a handful of expansions) means the game is infinitely replayable. (Or nigh-infinite.) The game can be taught in 2-3 minutes and can be done in 20-30. There's abstract strategy brought down to earth with the clatter of dice. Each deck plays differently, but the game doesn't bog down into special rules. Plus, my 7 year old can play with a fair amount of skill (or his father is just bad). 

In short, I think the "Master Set" one of the best values in gaming and encourage anyone to pick it up.

Initially an 8; bumped to 9 after my 6th play. It's as if chess and Magic had a teleporter accident while reading skirmish miniatures rules. Scratches a significant itch very well. Having experienced 8 or 9 factions, I'm very impressed with the variety of play styles without changing the core game play too dramatically (which can be a cheap trick).

RATING: 8
This is Magic the Gathering meets Chess.  The game is exceptionally strategic and well thought through.  I have very few complaints except for my similar complaints I have about chess, where I feel it is a good game but too competitive for its own good.  

The game does have many less strategic elements, however, like dice rolls and card draw which help take the edge off the competitive feel.  This is the reason I continue to play it and now own many of the factions.

Update: I really like how all of the factions play so well together and how 2 vs 2 is quite possible in this game, I am considering putting this as a 9 but will leave an 8 for now.

The longer the game is out, the more and more out-of-the-blue moves you need to be aware of.  Both the Cloaks and Jungle Elves have events that can move units meaning that it is very difficult to keep your summoner safe.  After seeing the previews of the decks in the master set, the game is getting further and further away with each release from being something that a new player can get into, since the events and abilities are getting more and more complex.  

That said, I love the simple base gameplay, the artwork, and the variety of "gimmicks" that you can find between all the varying factions.  Even the light deck-building element is simple enough to be approachable without being critical to the gameplay.

It has a Chess-like feel to it to me, almost like a thematic abstract with some more interesting additions. I like the different powers/races and how they all function quite differently. Some have stronger leaders, some have cheap units - that sort of thing. Much like Chess I'm not a big fan of the cat-and-mouse end game, even less so here as often a cornered leader can still wipe out a whole faction if you make the wrong moves. I'm sure many will see that as a strength of the game but doesn't work for me. But on a whole, it is a fun and interesting game with a lot of different choices and tactical decisions.

This is a great minatures-without-miniatures tactical board game that can get a bit pricey if you've got the collector's gene.  I do, so this will get a bit pricey.

The best starting point is the Master Set since it'll start you off with six races and a mounted board.  Really, a person would be happy if that's all they every picked up.

Asymmetrical tactical combat game. Each faction has an interesting balance of strengths and weaknesses. Dice heavy, but plenty of options make the game work even for the unlucky. And if your luck fails, the game is quick enough to clean up and try again.

Rates a point higher as the iPad app that eliminates the need to carry around an overly large board. Just don't play against the AI...

I was slightly disappointed with this game. Maybe I need to play a few more times or try some new decks, but it just felt a little empty. I also have to say something about how ripped off I feel about getting a large piece of paper for the player board. Bad form in my opinion.

EDIT: I logged two more plays yesterday and I'm appreciating it a bit more. I'm seeing it's more balanced than I thought. Rating change: 6 to 6.5

Two more plays tonight. Rating change: 6.5 to 7. I actually think I'd like to get a couple of the expansion decks. Yeah, I'm liking it.

EDIT: Okay, I've logged a few more plays and I can officially say I'm all in on Summoner Wars. I want to collect all the other factions and have tournaments with my family. Get this game!

RATING CHANGE: 7 to 8!

::RATING CHANGE:: 8 to 7.5

I've decided that it's just not my style of game. Still good by design, and the factions make it replayable for a long while. But a little too dependent on the timing of the draws at times.

I decided to wander over to the Board Room where I listened in on Summoner Wars  being explained and then jumped into a quick game. I enjoyed the game and am now on the fence about purchasing it. I’m somewhat wary because of the number of already released expansions and surely impending expansions, all of which I’d feel compelled to buy as well (and I’ve only recently weaned myself off Carcassonne expansions). The game is a cross between Magic: The Gathering, Stratego, and Hammer of the Scots. Magic because each player uses a separate deck of cards including creatures and spells with various abilities and health. Stratego because you place these cards on a grid and move them around in an attempt to kill the opponent’s leader (i.e., capture the opponent’s flag, except this time the flag can fight back). Hammer because it’s like Stratego but combat is resolved through a simple dice rolling mechanic when combatants meet on the battle field. There is no fog of war unlike similar games such as Stratego, Hammer, and Lord of the Rings: The Confrontation, but otherwise the game is definitely in that same camp. The expansions add a variety of other decks to the game, each with a different theme, such as goblins, orcs, elves, and dwarves. It was interesting to see the interplay of various special abilities combined with tactical movement around the board (which I should mention is just a paper mat). The cards are nice quality though. One nice mechanic of the game is that you can discard as many cards from your hand as you’d like at the end of each turn into your magic pool. You spend cards from your magic pool (a la San Juan or Race for the Galaxy except you’ve already designated them and they’re no longer in your hand) to purchase other cards. While you always draw back up to a full hand at the beginning of each turn, you lose if your deck runs out so you have to be careful about discarding too many cards. It’s clear that the designer has played many other good board games and has brought together a number of solid mechanics from those games to create this interesting result. In fact, from his profile on the Geek  you can see that the designer’s favorite games include Battlestar Galactica, HeroScape, Descent, Citadels, and War of the Ring, great taste all around (the comment accompanying his HeroScape rating is particularly amusing).

I recently played this again after a long break, and it's still an absolutely fantastic game. 

There are so many options and so many very different factions. The game itself is really simple, just a tactical game of attack and defence. There's a fair amount of luck in the card draw and the combat but some factions can reduce the randomness. 

The great thing is that it only takes 30 minutes or less for a game, so a rematch doesn't take long.

Very tactical with a well integrated theme.  It is pretty short in length for a war game, which is a major plus.  Each faction has a distinctive personality and play style. The dice are random, but increase the fun, and your decisions matter.  You will have plenty of tactical options on each turn and must manuevre your units well to maximize your potential outcome.

This is a great fanstasy wargame that is simple to learn and always tense.  The four player version is currently my favorite game.  Even when I get owned I have fun playing Summoners Wars.  Can't wait for expansions.

Summoner wars reminds me a bit of Heroes of Might and Magic. The skirmishes between two clans/hordes or races and the last man or creature standing after all the carnage wins. I do like the simplicity of the game in terms of movement and the number of cards in the deck. These cards never recycle as the summoners used these cards to initiate summoning. This makes the game shorter and more accessible.

One very okay play under my belt.  I played a rush strategy with the Cave Goblins, and didn't find very many decisions present in the game.

Like the theme and the art a lot.

Sheer fun. Initially I thought the game might not have the depth to stand up to repeated plays but it does! A simple ruleset, and unique factions all combine for a balanced, down-to-the-wire tactical experience. The theme comes out in the unique feel of each faction. This is the game that reignited my interest in "theme-based" games. 

I am always up for a game of Summoner Wars.

My wife thought this one looked like a "boy game" but after trying it she now requests to play!
--------------------------------------------------
After MANY games I have gone through the decision not to buy any more of the factions that come out. Since then I've tried them and knew that I had to buy. The new factions (CL & JE+ Master Set) really change the way you think in Summoner Wars and give the game incredible replayability.

If I have opponents of the same skill level as me I think I'll be enjoying this game for years and years to come!
---------------------------------------------------------
After hundreds of games I think I am tiring a bit of Summoner Wars. The game is still amazingly balanced, tense and enjoyable, I think I just recognize the small blemishes of the design (e.g. magic drain, defensive faction matchup stalling the game) that they bother me a bit more now. Maybe I just need a break and then to come back to it.

Summoner Wars is a fast-playing, action-packed 2-4 player card game. Players take on the role of Summoners: powerful beings who harness the power of mysterious Summoning Stones to lead their race to conquest on the war-torn planet of Itharia. These Summoners wield terrible magic on the battlefield, freezing their foes in place, draining their enemies of power, and even bringing rains of fire down from the heavens. But most notoriously, they summon their great race’s hordes of warriors to the battlefield, to clash in the never-ending struggle for supremacy. A Summoner is both mage and general, and must combine their wizardly might with clever tactics to defeat the enemy Summoner on the opposite side of the battle.
\13\\13\
Summoner Wars uses a simple but deep rules set to capture both the strategy of deck construction and card playing, with the tactics of miniature war games. By purchasing expansions or multiple Starter Sets, players can customize their Faction Decks to suit any style of play and to keep their opponents guessing. During the game, players summon and move their various warriors about the battlefield using their unique powers and abilities to wreak havoc on the enemy lines. In the course of a game each side will inflict terrible casualties upon the other in their brutal quest for victory.

Summoner Wars is a tremendously addictive game. Initially I wasn't completely sold on it, especially after watching the various video reviews. The game seemed too simple to hold my interest and quite frankly, the summoning walls seemed like a silly mechanism. My buddy Matt loved it though, telling me about it pretty much every time I talked to him for the better part of a year. I finally got to sit down and play it with him at Gen Con and I don't think I even made it all the way through our first game before I was hooked. I managed to play with three different factions over the course of the convention and I must say, I am amazed at how differently each one played. There are multiple Summoners in each faction that you can use to highlight different aspects of each army and despite a very simple combat system, there is a tremendous depth to each match up that gives the game an almost CCG feel. I haven't even had a chance to mess around with army construction and I'm already blown away by how much fun it is.

Absolutely loving this so far.  I was really excited about Battleground a few years ago, but was ultimately turned off by the complexity.  I still always loved the idea of a cheap, portable miniatures-style card game, with very different themed armies, and now Summoner Wars fits the bill.  It's simple enough to teach quickly, but seems to have plenty of tactical depth.

The games are very different, but with all the very different armies, the very bloody battles, and the healthy dose of randomness, I think this scratches a similar itch to Neuroshima Hex.  I love Neuroshima Hex, so that's fantastic.

Got both starter sets of this game. I weened myself off CCG's a while ago and this one seems to scratch an itch I've had for a while with regards to non-CCG fantasy themed card games. I do like the smaller decks (which some folks don't), and I like the tactical battlefield the game plays out upon. The rules are fairly simple and the game plays quick. It's gotten more support than not from the greater fantasy card and board gaming community which says a lot about the game. Deal me in.

Of the 2-player "my deck vs. your deck" sub-genre of games, this one is king for me. It takes that Magic: The Gathering kind of formula and adds in elements of spatial tactics and dice-combat on top of it.

Every bit is so cleverly implemented. Your object is simple: kill your enemy's summoner before he kills yours. Your deck is small, usually 30 cards or less. This is all the ammunition you'll have to win this war. Once you run out of cards, that's it! You've got to survive on whatever you've got left. How quickly you run through your resources (deck) is of vital importance.

Positioning in crucial. It's not just about what troops you put on the board but where you put them, when you move them and how you maximize their advantages. And yet, nothing is guaranteed. The dice will occasionally (but only occasionally, thanks to the way dice are used here) fail you...but if you're smart, you'll have a back-up plan waiting for just such a thing.

Summoner Wars is also amazingly accessible to new players, thanks to the fact that all the factions come as pre-made decks. So, you can just pick your favorite faction and start playing. No deck-construction required. And there are currently 40 different decks split between 16 different factions (some of those even being multi-faction mash-ups). And if you still really want to customize your decks...well, you can do that too. Oh, and did I mention that there's an app-version, too?

Summoner Wars has basically replaced all the CCGs, LCGs and TCGs on the market for me, for all these reasons and more. It's one of the most versatile, accessible and well-designed games out there and it's one of those experiences that makes me proud to be a gamer. This is top-shelf stuff and it will never leave my collection.

RATING: 6
There is absolutely no reason for die rolls in this game. If cards had many HP and many dice were rolled over the course of attacking (closer to Battlelore) the problem would be mitigated, but as is it's awful. With a 2/3 chance of hitting per attack, you often have to rely on hitting and can't play around not. And with low unit HP, the difference between hitting on a 2/3 chance and missing is whether you kill their unit or they attack back on their turn and kill yours. Way too big of a swing for a die roll to determine. Relying on output randomness to make an otherwise perfectly fine game more interesting (? do people actually think rolling dice in the middle of a chess-type game is "interesting"?) is a huge design misstep. The gameplay, especially the tradeoff between cards in deck and mana available to summon units, coupled with factions that feel very unique, make this a real missed opportunity. If they remove the die rolling and rebalanced the game accordingly, it would be great.

This is NOT like chess, as some may assert. In chess, the two sides are identical in every way. Summoner Wars invites you to challenge one faction against another different faction, each with their own special abilities that call for markedly different strategies from each side.

 I am quite surprised that Plaid Hat were able to come up with so many different factions that are so very different from each other, and yet any of them could hold their own against another if the player knows what they’re doing. Climbing wall vines, speeding ahead with a lion, mutating…there is simply so much imagination in each faction that makes them interesting and dynamic, I simply cannot see this game ever getting old.

If I had a woe, it is that I simply do not get to play this as much as I would like.

Own both starter sets, plus two Premium boards.  The boards are really nice, but $25 for the starter set and $15 for the board, and it only plays 2.  You need to buy a second starter set to play 3 or 4, but then you're going to want to buy a second board as well.  And then for completists, you need the Vanguard and Fallen Kingdom Faction Decks for $10 each.  It's not worth $100 for the parts you get, obviously.  But I must say after playing my first 2-player game, it's fast-paced and fun.  It would have been as much fun with just the starter set, however.  ;-)

And as far as the second board, the consensus seems to be that the 4-player variant is not as fun, due to excessive downtime.  Still, if 4 gamers are present, you can break out both boards and have a pair of 2-on-2 matches...

2 player battle game. Each player has a race deck and uses the cards to attack or defend. Thee is good variety between the races.

I am enjoying a newly rekindled love of this game. It's so well balanced, has just enough luck to keep it exciting for both players, and has enough variety of match-ups to support repeated play!

I enjoy the physical and iOS versions!

Pretty fun, reminds me a bit of Dreamblade.
I didn't like the Tundra Orcs so far.
Dwarves and Goblins are fun :)

A very simple and elegant card based wargame.

RATING: 9
A solid 2 player wargame, simple wargame. A better version of pocket battles. Would prefer to have a thin, but cardboard board, but that's a minor flaw. With just two factions looks a bit repetitive, but adding more factions would probably add another point to the rating.

RATING: 5
Even for a non-collectable card game, it was pretty disappointing. There's very little variety in the game, no room for customization, and games drag on way too long.

Very enjoyable. Very high replay value. I do not love the artwork but that fades after playing for a little while.

simple yet very deep game that is extremely addictive and fun to play - reminds me of a cross between chess and miniature combat with a fantasy theme - you have to try this one out, especially for the price point

I love the theme.  I love not having to measure.  I love that it is so easy to transport.  What's not to love?

EDIT: I now own the Dwarves and Goblins decks.  Thank you Dice Tower Secret Santa!

EDIT: (January 8, 2010) I know own all the decks and should be getting the reinforcement decks in soon.  I can't wait!

Good, tense, back and forth fighting the whole game. Would've bet on a certain side winning a few times, and been wrong. Definitely helps to know each side's strengths to help formulate your strategy.

A ton of expansions is a good and a bad thing for me. It's good to have variety but unless you play a lot and often you won't be able to really keep up with remembering what units/Summoners/events the different factions have. I wouldn't bother the the deck-building either but I see that as a good thing for the really competitive people playing this.

Sold.

Summoner Wars is a good game. Sure it's random, but it's good quick fun. I would enjoy both exploring each faction in depth, as well as trying just about every darn new expansion that comes out.

[b]SATISFYING TACTICAL CARD GAME[/b]

Knock down my rating by 2 whole points if playing a 4-player team game. Too much downtime. And the whole wrap-a-round board thing is difficult to explain theme-wise.

I own all the faction decks, and a deluxe board (which I feel is a must).

FAVE FACTIONS: Dwarves, and Jungle Elves.
DISLIKE: Benders, and Vanguards.

I'm usually wary of "wargames" that have a sole objective of killing the enemy's leader as there is usually some character killing combo or move available that takes the combat tactics out of the game.  They seem to have avoided that pitfall with this game though it still has more of a chess feel than a warhammer feel.  A veteran wargamer should have no trouble with the tactics available to the various factions but I expect it takes a few games to get the hang of the resource management necessary to bring out your more powerful units... though it is possible to win the game with only common warriors.

RATING: 6
Fun, but not as much fun as many would have us believe. I find the game has a strong advantage towards whoever acts first and the strategy is limited. The art is mediocre, and the components are as well, particularly the paper board which won't lay flat for all the world.
I do like the small box and the simple rule set, however, as well as the cheap price of factions allowing for easy expandability. I think it might make an excellent gateway game for fans of Magic: the Gathering.

Take control of a powerful Summoner calling forth your troops and strategically warring against other Summoners of varying backgrounds.

Oh MAN did I want to like this game.  It's basically a tile-laying version of Magic the Gathering.  Construct a deck of building and creature tiles, draw your hand, play some tiles, move them around the board, beat on opponents' creatures, win the game.  AWESOME, in theory.

But Summoner Wars is the most AP-prone game I've ever seen.  Barring a big disparity in player skill, the winner is the player that's willing to sit and stare at the board the longest before taking his turn.

You're a Summoner trying to outmanouver and outcast your opponent on a papergrid. Fast & fun, deck & skirmish oriented battlegame with 6 (atm) entirely different army choices. Rating may rise in the future as the fun factor is high on this game. Thin paper sheet that should be the battlefield is just horrible.

edit: I bought the deluxe board, no more nightmares from that paper sheet..

RATING: 5.5
The game is ok, but it's not my piece of cake. I dont like the (defence favoring) mechanics/strategy that much and it takes a little too much time for my taste of 1v1 card game. Also im not sure how well balanced the game is between the clans and there is some competitive shuffling issues with some cards' backsides being different colors in the same deck.

I always rate a game high when i get the "why someone did not think of it earlier" feeling after the first plays.

Plays fast and has some really tough decisions. The Magic pile mechanism combined with the limited movement and attack actions, really shines.

I hope we will see more expansions soon and the big bet is whether the game stays balanced after all these expansions.

Really a gem of a game. Try this.

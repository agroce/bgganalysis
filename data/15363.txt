I was very impressed with this game. I had heard great things and wanted it mostly due to the rarity of finding a copy. I was not disappointed. The game is a very light area control game with a lot of battling going on. It feels much more like a euro game than a war game due to the victory point system. I loved the secret mission cards. My girlfriend loved the little creatures (they are really well-made).

A fun area control/ameritrash dicefest game.  Humans are at the bottom of the food chain in this one.  My only complaint is that depending on how the exploration tiles come out, one player might get a huge advantage if they aren't distributed evenly.  Controlling the monolith is somewhat unbalanced also.

I like it, its dinamic and I like the card system suporting it. I just sometimes get the feeling that I forgot to take an energize or mission card after battles.

I really like it, also secret mission and energize cards can make you win even if it does not look like the war is in your favour, which is good. Also energize cards  help to balance the play. Good also because no player elimination is present. 

Glowing figures are wonderful :)

I think after 2 years this game will be a winner for my 3 nephews.

I see a lot of potential in this game.  I've played two games so far, one with three players (thanks for suffering through it, Brad--I know it's not your kind of thing) and one with two.  What I think would be the most fun is a four player game, two players on each team.  The pieces are great, and there's a lot of strategy involved with the mission cards.  I'm pretty impressed with the newish Avalon-Hill/Hasboro games.  
[update]  So far, the two team attempts I've played haven't turned out that great.  I think the balance of experience and luck in these games was the culprit.  I still think it would make an excellent team game amongst well-balanced teams.

RATING: 9
A superb combination of American-style space battle game and just the right amount of Eurogame mechanics. The Energize cards in particular are a great way to handle the problem of a runaway leader (unlike the artificial promotion of the trailing players in Tempus).

Played a friend's copy and it's a nice, light little wargame. Hasbro tried to spiff it up with sort of glow in the dark pieces which made it look cheap to me. Some interesting tactical choices but little strategy. I'm not a fan of multi-player games in which a player can be elliminated like this one. The game probably works best with four players. It's pretty rough as a three player because two players can pinch the middle guy and it's game over for him. There's sort of a cute "King of the Hill" aspect too with the raised middle section. Overall, better than you'd think but just by a little.

Played the demo version only.  Straightforward play style.  Character pieces are nice.  I can see this being very interesting if played with 3 or 4 players.  Stategy and diplomacy will be key.

A quick, light, and easy wargame! It's... INGENIOUS!!!

The pieces are certainly cool and nice to look at, though the box is a bit overly-yellow. The modular board is very nice, colorful, and cartoony. The game scales well for any number of players; the staggered starting income is a great balancing mechanism, and all the exploration tiles are roughly equal in value. I use blue acrylic crystals for rubium, which add a Starcraft-esque coolness to the game.

Also, the pieces have a distinct alien-odor that just adds to the theme! :p

Finally got this to the table for a first play with a couple I met through BGG (Dick and Laurie).  It was a good learning session, and the game was a lot of fun and seems to be pretty deep for what it is.  

I had a lot of fun throwing away all of my units in a desperate bid for VP, falling just one short of the required 12 for victory (if one die roll had been a 4 instead of a 2 I would have pulled it off!) A turn later, Dick attacked my home base with three Rubium Dragons from the monolith.  He won the battle, and with two secret mission cards, the attack netted him 7 VP in one fell swoop, for a huge and surprising come-from-behind win!  He had been in last place with only 6 vp to my 11 and Laurie's 8 or 9!  Great game.

A pretty entertaining and easy to play wargame. I had fun... the game moves at a brisk pace and has nice balancing mechanisms to keep everyone involved until the end. I won't go running out to purchase Nexus Ops, but admit that it is a nice choice for a Risk-type game that plays in an hour.

I need to play this again sometime. I only have a few plays. I think this could be a great 4 player chaotic attack fest. 
Update: This game has an odd pacing. Once all the teams get set-up in a good position, someone quickly wins. Still need more plays to fully comment.

RATING: 8
Reminds me Warcraft the Boardgame but better and faster. The victory points and resources for troops are a little like Settlers, but you must be agressive in fights. If there was combat in Settlers, it may be simple like this. We played this 3 times and it keeps getting better. works best 3-4 players. Dragons are tough! Best AH game of the new ones.

Fantastic game. I love simpler tactical level conflict / war games and this one is particularly great when you have 3-4 players. It looks less geeky than Summoner Wars and doesn't require the myriad expansions that multilayer Commands and Colours requires. This makes it the ideal game in its genre for family / casual gamers.

I like this one alright. This amounts to a very simple combat system with some randomly received victory conditions. I do love the game bits - nice plastic guys. Like the speed of play for the most part. But in the end, it's a bit too simplistic for me and feels predictable - it is indeed a very simple American dice war game. However, my girls seems to like it for some reason so I'll be hanging on to it and playing occasionally.

RATING: 4
The thing I don't like is, that you have no way to guess what gives your opponent victory points. Randomness is no problem with me, but in a wargame it should be clear to all players what to defend and what to attack against.

Pure Ameri-Trash goodness!  

This game contains almost all that is happy in a single box.  For starters, it has garish artwork on the cover that looks like Napoleon Dynamite drew it.  That rocks.

It has plastic.  Mmmmm...plastic!  And that plastic glows under a dark light.  If anything is more cool than that, I'm taking nominations.  Anything?  Nope.  Didn't think so.

And the plastic: it has things called "rock crawlers", "rubium dragons", and "lava leapers", but you know what they REALLY are?  They are spiders, dragonflies, and dinosaurs.  Yeah, you heard me: this game has dinosaurs in it, and if you know anything about anything, you know that dinosaurs are the most awesome thing e-vah, and will increase the "kickassedness"  factor of any game by at least an order of magnitude.

What else does it have?  It has a cheap cardboard monolith, and if you can't have a plastic one, I want a cheap cardboard one!  Yeah!  That rules!

Best of all, it drips with theme, conflict, dice, crystalline forests, and much other goodness.

But I'm going to warn ya: if you are wuss or a Eurogamer (one in the same?), stay away from this game, because it will frighten you.  You will wake up screaming from the bad dreams this game will give you, because you have never stood face-to-face with this much awesomeness in your life.

This game plays equally well with 2, 3, or 4 players.  

Note: I'm talking about the original Hasbro version.  The re-made FFG version lacks ANY monolith and the figures do not glow under a black light.  That is weak.  Get the original if you can.

I love playing this game with my kids or anyone else who will play it.  It has a fun theme, good mechanics, and is overall an enjoyable game.  We always forget to take cards when the turn ends or take points when a battle is won, so there is some record keeping that is a slight annoyance, but that more a comment about our attention to detail than the game itself.

This is A&A lite, and A&A rite.  Fun game in a shorter playing time.  The mix of 6 unit types is very interesting.

RATING: 6
A fun game but pretty random.  Combat is resolved by dice rolls, though more expensive units clearly have the advantage.  I love the glow-in-the-dark (well, not really) pieces!  Gameplay goes fairly quick and the game length is pretty good.

I would probably have rated it a 7+ except for the fact that scoring is pretty random.  It's entirely possible to be losing your battles and have the fewest pieces on the board, yet have the highest VP due to played mission cards.  Granted that's just part of the random element (which is pretty high in this game), and I'm not *that* big a fan of randomness, but I wish there was a bit more control and/or a more direct or tighter connection between success on the board and winning.

I would definitely play Nexus Ops again, though it wouldn't be my first choice.

RATING: 7
A lot of dice-luck, but the better general will usually win.  You can't fight the battle the other player wants to have!  Not bad.  Not great -- exploration's too short, it drags a bit.

Downgraded some because the occasional lopsided "hi, have all the rock striders AND the two mines" opening for one player in 2p can lead to a really lousy game -- yes, the other player _might_ win with very solid play, but it's so uphill the fun goes away, and if you get the win off such a start it feels cheap.  Now, this usually doesn't happen, but it can, which is a downside.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
It seems unique in addressing the problem of most multiplayer attrition based war-games, in that combat with a purpose other than resource gain is how to win. Loss can be used as an advantage. Essentially 'Risk' or 'Axis&Allies' the victory system makes it a favourite. Because of its multiplayer strengths though, it is lacking as a two-player.

Fortunately, my luck changed by the end of the year. I found some great flatmates who became my new gaming group. So now we usually play in three or four players. As they are new to boardgaming I let them choose what we'll play, so not to impose my own taste on them.
One of the games that they requested was Nexus Ops. Nexus Ops was a game I didn't warm much to. It is a great introductory game because people usually love the translucent bits. The table talk it generates creates a great social atmosphere. And the dice keep it from taking itself too seriously. But I found it a little bit too fiddly with all the bits and moving them on the modular board, and space consuming with all the cards spread around. Also, I had the feeling that luck of the draw of the mission cards influenced the winner too much. But after playing the game again I changed my mind. I realized that the key to play Nexus Ops well was being aggressive and discriminatory with the mission cards you draw. If the mission cards are unachievable discard them for rubidium and the ones you keep fulfill as soon as possible. With this simple observation the game was no longer playing me, but the other way around. There is still the possibility that you can have a run of extremely bad luck and lose for a point because you drew worse mission cards than your opponents, but now in those situations I feel ecstatic that I could offer them a worthy resistance and not just waiting for the game to finally finish, as I did before.
Sometimes it's good to give games a second chance.

Fantasy Flight edition. This is a quick and dirty area control/light war game that rewards aggression and is very well balanced. Tons of colorful miniatures, a modular board, a plethora of variants that really change the game up, and its easy to explain. It's a real gem and I enjoy it very much.

Pese a que ni las miniaturas ni el tablero llamaron mi atención demasiado, el juego consiguió cautivarme en una sola partida. Básicamente el juego consiste en comprar unidades, darse piñas, controlar minas para ganar dinero, comprar más tropas, darse más piñas, aliarse para ir a por un jugador, guardar cartas en la mano para sacar en determinados momentos y ganar puntos, y darse más y más... Para mí, irresistible.

Nexus Ops is a fun, risk-like game that my friends and I have enjoyed immensely! The first few times we played the games lasted over an hour and a half. We couldn't comprehend how other players were knocking out games in half an hour to fourty-five minutes.

I then played it with another group of friends. Unlike my original game group, these friends did things such as attack hexes with only two or three units built up. They used humans as fodder, but didn't need twelve of them stacked up before they felt it was safe to attack. Astonishingly, we played two games and had a smoke break in the time it took my original group to play one.

The problem is that my original group played very defensively. There must have been a group-think problem as well because we all played that way. I'm sure they will enjoy the game much more with an aggressive play style. I know I do.

RATING: 7
A great (and more fun) alternative for those who are fans of Risk.  Still a lot of dice throwing and luck during battles, but lots more decisions to be made, based on different terrain types, resources, and opponents troop types.

One great thing about this is that it is difficult to get knocked out of the game, since the farther someone stretches from their home base, the weaker they will get.  By the time they get to your home base, their troops are significantly spread out and can be held off.  (You will still lose if they are all the way to your base, but as least you can still effect the end game)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Very intuitive tactics game. I like skirmish games, variable unit types to deploy, income management, and randomized map setups. Nexus Ops offers a light approach to all of these mechanics (yay!), but the lightness means that there is a heavy degree of luck (boo!). Nonetheless, the heart of the game isn't the luck, it's the secret mission victory point system. 

The secret missions really make the game and help Nexus Ops have a laser focus on a being a quick sci-fi dudes on a map game with just a little bit of strategy. Just enough to keep it fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Pros
- Cool minis 
- Die rolling for combat and how combat is done is great
- Attack order for your troops makes a difference 
- Secret objectives gives you direction
- You get rewarded for being the aggressor 
- If you lose a battle, you get some kind of reward
- Different variations of the game included in the book and box for replayability 
- Risk players will get it and it's more fun than Risk

Cons
- Some tiles are hard to distinguish and a messy design 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Plays well with 3-4 players, although luck is definitely a factor, in both tile draws and dice rolling.  But it's a great game to play with the guy who ALWAYS wants to play Risk, because it's fun and quick.

A very light game with a fair amount of dice rolling, but the random nature of the game can be controlled with a decent strategy.  This is NOT a deep game and the options available during a turn are quite limited.  The bits are very cool, but you already knew that...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Decent theming and some reasonable ideas, notably the secret mission cards that keep games short and aggressive, while varying your objectives a bit. The cute, glow in the dark pieces are nice too.  As with Vegas Showdown, the rules are exemplary.  Also as with Vegas Showdown, there's some obvious cost cutting (the monolith and the useless box divider) in an otherwise well produced package.   

Nexus Ops is a simple slugfest; there are none of the strategic and tactical subtleties that other simple wargames offer.  And a poor start, due to the luck of the discovery tile draw and/or some bad die rolls, will very quickly leave you trailing in the wake of other players.  Nonetheless, I had a bit of fun playing this game a couple times.

This game is really all about agression.  If you're looking for a building, development or exploration game look else where.  If you're looking for a souped up version of a combat/resources game that playes in 45-60 minutes then this is a good solution.  Downgraded the rating slightly, I don't care for the rich get richer aspect of this too much, The 2 energize cards for the holder of the tower seems too powerful.

Quicker, more conflict oriented game of RISK that rewards being aggressive.  Enjoy breaking this out as much of my board-gaming roots come from playing RISK.

RATING: 8.5
I traded for this game based on suggestions given me here on the Geek at my request for a game to replace Risk. It was great advice! I LOVE this game. It's exactly what I love about Risk (and more), and not what I hate about Risk. It's fast playing (Clocking in at around 1-2 hours). It's deeper than Risk, but not too deep. It's just way more fun!

It has dice so there's definately luck involved.  Not to say that there's no strategy though.  I like the unique abilities of each unit and the random hex setup.  The blacklight reactive minis are awesome too.  Now if I can only track down a copy without selling my right kidney for it...

Without a doubt, one of the friendliest rulebooks I have ever seen. The game itself has deceptively deep decisions to be made, and lots of fun for all player types to be had. I wish they had reconsidered the circus animal look of things, that makes the game a hard sell to non-believers.

RATING: 8
A neat light wargame that plays fun and fast (well compared to other wargames at least). Comes packed with some beautiful mini-minis and has a ruleset that is easy to digest from the get-go. Gameplay allows for a variety of tactics to be employed. 

Only grip I have is that I would like some player differences (in terms of everyone having special powers), but looks like the forums offer this and other variants to incorporate for increased replayability and fun!

Excellent game. Gives the feel of a nice, American-style, build-and-fight game in a short amount of time. It's strategic, yet not too heavy. Easy to teach and fun for practically everyone.

Plays well with any number of players.

Played with alternative units once- did not like those. The vortex variant is fun, however.

RATING: 7
Each aspect of the game's design is not unique, but the collection of mechanism makes for a convincing little game.  There is a large luck factor in both combat (i.e. dice) and in objectives (i.e. cards).  The latter is the larger drawback since a series of unusable or impractical objective cards will slow VP gains.  To the game's credit, this drawback is handled admirably well and results in a surprisingly well balanced game play.  Keep the game play action moving for best results.  [GTI Code: TPCL]

RATING: 8.1
Dudes on a map, but some pretty freaky alien dudes battling over resources for various science fiction institutions. Pretty straightforward area control and simplistic combat, with victory points coming from both your prowess in battle and specific objectives you'll try to achieve. I do wish the factions were a little more asymmetrical and had more personality, but you can use the Alternate Units on the back sides of the reference sheets, and there are quite a number of little variants you can employ into the game. A classic for a reason, and you can see how it inspired other designs, though I can't deny that it's been surpassed a number of times.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Like many wargames, can be a bit unbalanced with three players, where staying out of the initial fighting and letting the other two players weaken themselves can be key.  Fun and quick to learn.  This is not one of those games where you spend the whole first game figuring out how you should be playing.  In the A.H. version, the production values of the monolith in the middle is a little bit of a letdown, but the great plastic figures more than make up for this.  Who says cubes rule?  The sculpts of the Avalon edition are unique and wonderful.

A game with the emphasis on tactics rather than strategic decisions, not a lot of deep thinking involved.  Can see playing this occasionally, but not every game night.

Fast game of bashing enemy alien armies. Aggression good, defensive play bad: in my last game the player who carefully built up large forces defending mining bases won fewest victory points.

Meh.  Too much work for too little payout.  Too much luck based on the rolls of the dice and too much work to keep track of the cards that you are and are not supposed to get and use and keep.  May need to find someone who knows the rules and strategies inside and out to question and try against.

A fantastic light war-game that does a few important things well.  1) it rewards (rather than punishes) aggressive players.  2) accommodates more than 2 people rather nicely.

I am constantly recommending this game to people looking for a step-up from risk.

It actually has a lot in common with Axis and Allies (aside from the theme) but it works better and plays faster than A&A

This is Settlers of Catan... Avalon Hill style.  Usually I prefer more complexity in gaming, but after experiencing StarCraft, I can safely say that the simplicity of rolling dice in Nexus Ops is perhaps just as fun as using the Zergling number of Tech cards found in StarCraft.  The component quality for Nexus Ops is pretty good... except for the (paper fold-out) monolith.

UPDATE AGAIN: I'm increasing my score to a ten. I've played a few other skirmish games like this and I have now decided that this one is the best in my collection.

UPDATE: Wow! I finally got a chance to play a 4-player game and that makes a massive difference to this game. Four players is absolutely the sweet spot for Nexus Ops. It was an awesome and very tense game.

Played this with my brother. I lost in the end and we got some of the rules a little off, but I felt like it was still a solid victory in that he just had the better strategy. As an early birthday gift, my brother game me a copy of the Avalon Hill edition. The game pieces look awesome. I plan to pull this one out the next time I have game night at my house. Some of my games never leave my house because the thought of them getting rained on or played/placed on a dirty surface makes me sick to my stomach. This is one of those games.

Comes with a huge pile of plastic aliens. Yay! The game itself is pretty fun. The rules are simple, there's a nice amount of luck to it, but you still have to play smart or you'll get clobbered.

Plus I really like the idea of the Secret Mission cards.

Fun game! I like the light wargame aspect of this. And the variable monster powers make it a good light, strategic wargame/area control hybrid.

Warcraft, Solo

A nice short, light wargame with great bits (even if they do smell a little rubbery when you first open the box). There's not enough variety for me, though---there's only one scenario, and the game doesn't seem to be made to have more than one.  Each player has the same kind of army, which yields only six different units.  But I do like the event tiles for exploration, the secret mission cards, and the way you get energize cards.  The units that do exist are interesting to play with, and the landscape may not vary too much from game to game, but each terrain type definitely has its own effects.  But I don't think this is the RTS-like game for me, though I think it would be very enjoyable for many.  Kudos to AH/WotC/Hasbro here.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Some people like the old components such as units that glow under black light but I'm more than happy with the average looking tiles and very nicely sculpted units from FFG.

The battleground is randomly generated and you play for victory points, which come from achieving varied objectives. Area control is an element: you need to control the high value tiles. However, just as often you're attacking a different tile to complete a secret objective.

Combat is similar to Axis and Allies in that different units hit on different roles, but different because more powerful units attack before weaker ones.

2-player needs some work.  Not a bad game though.  It's really easy for a bad luck of the draw to heavily favor one player over the other.  You get some good tiles close to your base, and it sucks.

...whereas you could see how that would work in 3-player really well.  Sure, a good tile far away from you would suck, but that also means the other two guys fight eachother for it.

Sort of a grown-up version of Risk (bear with me). Quite dice heavy, you get more reinforcements if you have more territory and play is directed towards building up big armies and using them to rampage into opposing territory. That being said, the races are nicely differentiated and balanced, so that 3 or 4 of the weakest (humans) can gang up on and kill one of the most powerful (dragons). The tactics (go for a big area to get income or the monolith to get extra cards) seem nicely balanced also. Not the most mentally demanding of games but lots of fun with cool figures thrown in.

RATING: 9
This might be the best "Dudes on a Map" game in existence.  It's rules are simple and straightforward.  The game rewards aggression and turtling is a sure fired way to lose.  The secret mission cards are a stroke of genius.  They give you short term objectives and keep players from guessing your tactics.  I love this game.  It's a bonafide classic.  The AH edition has some of the coolest minis in existence.  If you can't get that version buy the FFG edition while it's still in print.  If you like chucking dice and killing troops this game is a must.

RATING: 8
Based on a single playing.  Mechanic reduces/eliminates turtling, which is good in a game like this.

Edit: upping it a point after a few more plays.  Scales great from 2-4, conflict without turtling, neon pieces.  What's not to like?

Seems to combine some elements of Axis & Allies (unit purchases and aspects of combat from the D-Day game), RISK (Secret Mission and Energize cards), Titan (creature recruitment and funky hex board), and Chitin:I (weird creatures with different fighting abilities). The resulting game is a surprisingly quick and light wargame (90 minutes for our frst game) that rewards using Energize cards to leverage fulfilling the conditions of the Secret Mission cards. "Turtling" is probably the least viable strategy because you don't always have to win battles to earn victory points. But fighting IS the quickest path to victory, so mix it up!

RATING: 6.5
Above average.  The secret missions concept is good fun... it tends to encourage many small battles, resulting in more action & more fun.  IMO this game is better than most dice-fest wargames (ex. Risk, A&A).  My minor complaints are... the randomness of secret missions, their low trade-in value of 1 rubium (worsening the situation if you have bad card draws), and the fact that you usually don't have many secret mission cards so the game is more tactical (less strategic).

Fast moving combat game which looks a little bit like Neuroshima hex and plays a little bit like Galactic Conquest. The balancing mechanism of awarding you a useful card when you lose a battle helps to keep things close. Once we'd all started scoring, most of the game saw the 4 of us within 2VP of each other. Neat.

RATING: 7
I think this would be an "8" for me a few years ago. Perhaps unfairly I am ranking it as a "7" perhaps because I've played and enjoyed so many games that imitated the best elements of Nexus Ops (secret objectives, building resource engines, unit special powers) in a more sophisticated, thematic way. "Lava leaper" just doesn't resonate for me, so sometimes the game's dice-iness seems a little naked. All of that said, this is really a very clean, very tight, super-light war game with a small footprint of investment, time, table space and rules complexity. I admire Nexus Ops and always enjoy a session. I usually opt for something a little heavier and more thematic (I'd probably go for Kemet, at least), but for playing with my friends with less tolerance for heavier games, it's absolutely perfect. I don't expect to ever let it leave my collection; there just too few games like this out there. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Nexus Ops offers decent components, but there is still some room for improvement. Gameplay consists of relatively short turns in which a player mainly builds up a strong force, looks for holes in the opponents defense, and strikes at the opportune moment to claim victory points.

RATING: 7.5
Pure multi-player slugfest. The way victory points are won ensures that battles will be fought and many of them! The nature of the board throws you into conflict with your neighbors from the outset, and the nature of the VP card conditions will likely ensure that alliances will be short-lived. If "turtling" to stay below the radar bothers you in multi-player wargames, this should be right down your alley. This game is like Risk on steroids, and could remind you somewhat of the tactical battles in "Titan."

Perfect Ameritrash game, which has all elements it needs. Is has a Light, short but effective combat system. The gameplay is driven by the secret missions you draw and the landscape tiles in front of your homebase. So every player tends to have his own army compositon, aligned with his cards. The mechanism to get VP by attacking gives the game a dynamic element. Top notch looking units support a unique atomosphere for the game.

Kicks asss!!!

This gem is a little under rated in that it does so much so very dynamically and in such a fun way.

The componets are unbreakable and have a really nice tactile feel to them.

Each time you make a turn you can have the momentum spiral in your favor or sadly it can run comepletely away from your favor.


There are some great things to it tactically- luck wise and also strategically.

There are several luck aspects to the game.


The Energizer cards-The mining oportunities- The secret strategy cards- and then there are dice rolls which you can lean in your favor but the game givews the impression of an unpredictahble took which might take a jump start.



really fun!!

Had the Avalon hill edition forever, traded it for this edition. Though the board looks like someone used Microsoft paint to design it and the day-glo pieces are now pastel messes, I do appreciate the extra modes and options for this one, as well as the much nicer card stock. It's a luck fest, but it doesn't overstay it's welcome.

RATING: 6
Scratches a certain itch- light tactical combat with lots of mandatory attacking, I guess.  And the fact that you are basically forced to attack is maybe the best thing about the game.  The luck of the dice and mission cards is both fun and annoying in this.  Some of the mission and energize cards are really cool and rolling dice is always fun.  But some bad dice rolls or the right mission card at the right time can easily win or lose the game for you if everything else is equal.  Good but never really clicked, or at least not as much as I hoped.

I wish this game was around when I was a young teenage boy. I would have played it constantly. 

My 6-year old boy enjoys playing this with me, probably for the blacklight effect more than anything else. I have to read the cards for him and help him with his strategy a bit. 

To me, it's the most fun 'ameritrash' game I've played. Very much like the old-school computer games I used to play.

I've only played this once and feel like I need to play it again before I could give it a fair rating.  Ignoring who I played it with, I enjoyed this game.  It felt like a combination of Chess and Risk (with an emphasis more on Risk).  I liked the different powers of the different pieces, the varied attack ideas.  Over all, it felt good.  Looking forward to a chance to play it again.

RATING: 7
Update:  Having fun with this game, although it feels odd that I keep winning.   I'm starting to have concerns about the tile distribution and the secret mission card distribution, as these could really put a player at a disadvantage.  

Rating of 7.5 is based on 4 plays (3p, 3p, 4p, 2p), two of which were abbreviated.  

2p: quick with little downtime, but not much going on at the beginning.

3p: conflicts arrived relatively quickly, moderate downtime

4p: conflicts arrived really quickly, but even more downtime (unless I'm being attacked).  

I would like to try the partnership game (2 vs. 2).

This is my first out-of-print game purchase.

Juego sencillo y entretenido. Se trata de un juego de toñas, que llama la atención por el material de las figurillas.. de una especie de plástico fluorescente muy llamativo. Es un juego de "todos contra todos". Cada jugador dispone de un ejército y el objetivo es conseguir 12 puntos de victoria. Se obtiene un punto de victoria por cada batalla que ganas. Alternativamente se pueden obtener puntos de victoria cumpliendo una serie de "misiones secretas".
Es un juego sencillito y sin grandes pretensiones. Es como una versión muy simplificada de wargames básicos, tipo Axis and allies. A su favor. Dura poco. La partida se resuelve en poco más de una hora.

I think I might like it better cutthroat than the team play. The luck element is somewhat more decisive in driving outcomes of battles than tactics, as good battle card draws can turn the tide, despite a carefully planned assault. However, income generation and choosing how to spend for new units has some weight in determining the outcome. Younger players prefer to play this, or Epic Duels.

The game looks awesome and is a huge amount of fun to play.  For a dicefest multiplayer-wargame it does a good job of making sure everyone gets into the action and no-one falls too far behind. Great fun!

RATING: 10
Hands down the best wargame-lite on the scene. The board is made up of hexagonal regions placed in a hexagonal pattern which favors no player and offers the same opportunities and risks to all.

The mission cards give every player their own objectives that often encourage aggressive play. Units are purchased at the beginning of one's turn and reflect the price you pay for them (i.e. a more expensive unit will have a marked advantage over a cheaper unit) so the dice-based fighting system is properly balanced and doesn't cause infuriating situations where an ill-prepared player steamrolls a stronger opponent through lucky rolls.

Nexus Ops is generally much shorter than its counterparts which is also a huge positive in my opinion.

The first time we played this game it was a disaster, as a rules conflict caused an argument and some hurt feelings. After that it was almost two years before we tried to play it again.

Now we really enjoy it. It's may be my favorite "battle" game, as despite it's apparently combative nature, the winning conditions are varied, and there is some strategy to decisions. It still has a bit more luck than I usually like, but somehow it almost always gets pulled out when it's late, almost everyone has already gone home, and the remaining few just want one more game.

I like this game. It's a great option when you want that Risk-ish game, but don't have 4 hours. If you play quickly you can wrap it up in 1 hr from box open to close. I played in about 1hr with two of my boys (10 & 15) and it was only our 3rd game. However, I'm hoping to play this with a few cutthroat gamers (so I don't have to go easy on the 10 yr old).

I really tried to like Nexus Ops, and it has some cool stuff in it - the objective cards are a cool idea, even if not particularly well balanced. I think what kills the game here though is the economic subsystem. In a four-player game, waiting for everyone else to add up their credits and spend them on stuff really kills game momentum, and makes the downtime hard to tolerate. I enjoyed it well enough, but I think there is no reason to play this ahead of the two Star Wars Risk games, which I think really take the genre of Risk-like games and moves them forward, while most other similar games (this, Antike, Risk: Godstorm, Risk: 2210) have bolted-on economic games which detract from rather than add to the interest of the game. This whole genre is about sharp action and taking risks, not about economics, and I think the need to fiddle economic systems detract from the game. The decisions about troop mixes simply aren't that interesting, unlike in, say, Axis & Allies, where infantry/tank/air mixes in your forces are pretty important (A&A has other problems, of course).

First edition copy.  Love the game more and more with every play. The hitch with this game is it actually plays better with 3 and 4 players than with two.  Still a great game with 2 however.  There can just be a few things that can go one way or another that can make it a tad unbalanced with 2.

Good wargame.  A fun wargame, with some strategy.  Its better than risk and Axis and Allies.  Some combats could become dicefests among two players, but the Energize cards help to remove this luck somewhat.  Recommend everyone try the game to see if its their "style" and make up their own mind.

RATING: 7
I didn't like this game much as a two player game. It took way too long for the two sides to meet and get to the fighting. Much superior as a three or more player game.

Despite the random tile placement - it doesn't really feel like "a different game every time" as the tiles don't have nearly the functionality that they do in something like Catan. Each tile produces the same results with the exception that some characters get plus 1 dice rolls when positioned in certain areas. To me, that's not really worth the pain-in-the-butt set up and take down times that all tile-based games share. It's a fun game - but undoubtedly Ameritrash thinly disguised as a Eurogame.

I like this game for a quick and scrappy combat game. It's incredibly dice dependent, which never works out in my favor. But as a whole, the theme and light-hearted aggression really make it work.

RATING: 9
This is a great system for a light bashy combat game.

First off, the pacing and playtime are excellent. Even your first time through you'll be done in under 2 hours - which is just about how long my attention span lasts for any given game. I like the way that things heat up fast - maybe 2-3 turns of just exploration and building up units/currency, then, due to the pleasingly small map size, you're all up in each other's faces ready to start throwing down. Nice!

And fighting in this game WILL happen. This is not a game that encourages defensively play. This is a huge plus in my book. Too many "combat" games boil down to turtling.

I'm usually not a fan of secret objectives but they work well here because they're not long-term secrets nobody is going to know to how to prevent, they're just the kind of small things that come up through regular play and everyone should always be trying to do the same things anyway so preventing people from getting them is a matter of course.

The components are lovely. The creatures are weirdly cute and while I might never make use of the glow factor they LOOK super cool just because they can glow. The tiles have nice art too!

The energize cards are a great mechanic. I feel like in games with dicey combat, being rewarded for being beat up on is a MUST and these do the trick pretty well.

The king of the hill thing it's got going on in the center of the map is great in theory but can have its issues. Firstly, it feels like 2 energize cards per turn is too rich a reward because they just help you KEEP the monolith locked down.

There are a lot of ways in which luck affects the outcome, obviously. You can roll poorly despite your best efforts. You can have games where it's simply easier for one player to get to the monolith. You can have games where you're not getting energize cards or secret objectives that are helpful/achievable in your current situation, or one player can start near all the most lucrative mines. But overall I think the luck factor is acceptable for the game length.

On that note - the game works well with any number of players on the box but with the more you have, the more you can gang up on someone who's just getting lucky.

Also: I dig that the game ends immediately if one player is eliminated. More games need that rule.

Despite the tangible luck factor, I always have fun when I play this. Yeah, there's a lot of luck but sometimes you just want to roll some dice to beat some dudes in the face and this is a clean, elegant system for just that.

I gave this game to my son (8 years old) for his birthday and he and my husband, Michael, have played 4 rounds today and are still going.  Michael says it's the best 2 player game that he has played with our son (better than Heroscape or Memoir '44), and they both rate it a 9.  It's quick to set up and replayability seems high.  I picked up the red rubium crystals online mentioned in some of the picture captions, and they add much to the game.

This is a fun game. The game forces you to fight and expand, and the energize cards can keep you in it even if you are behind. I like that the monolith seems really strong until you realize that taking and holding it is not a good way to get points. 

Fills a niche in my collection that nothing else does.

RATING: 8
This is a very nice mix of ameritrash and eurogame. You attack each other and destroy units, but you do so in order to complete secret objectives and be the first player to achieve 12 points, at which point you win immediately. I tend to like games in which you can win immediately and this is definitely no exception.

I love the way you can get points: by winning combats as the attacker and via secret objectives, which I’m always a sucker for. The secret objectives can be to destroy a specific unit and non-combat missions like controlling most forest areas etc. This is really awesome and what definitely makes the game shine for me! The slightly assymetric setup and especially the 6 different units also make the game very exciting. The units have special powers (and the units are “double-sided, meaning the variety is significantly increased), and while the dragon is awesome, you need to have some cannon fodder too due to how combat works (which is evidence of a smooth design).

Nexus Ops is a very good game, and while the Monolith is very strong indeed as you get two cards each round, so if a player gets a foothold and fortify the Monolith, the other player needs to be worried, although it’s definitely not a sure thing that you win if you control the Monolith, which has been proven in several of our games. The cards, the exploration bonuses, the units and the objective cards are what make Nexus Ops such a great game!

RATING: 7.5
Light, fun, no turtling possible if you want to win, doesn't last too long. The pieces make the game very appealing. Symmetrical forces and the increased starting resources for later starting players seem to avoid any balance issues but still the random set up of resource mines can favour certain players and of course bad rolling (no Combat Results Table) throws in luck to make this game light and mans even a good strategy can lose easily.

Received this in a trade for Colosseum and a new copy of Thunderstone.

Initial rating an 8. First off, I'm glad I got this in a trade. If I spent approx. $75 for an out-of-print copy, I'd probably be kicking myself. Because I didn't break the bank, I can enjoy the game for what it is... a fun combat-themed dice fest with plenty of luck but also enough meat and tactics behind it.

The game is simple enough... spend rubium to make units, send units out to battle, win battles to score VPs. The fun is in mixing up the different units, racing to control the mines and gain those freebie units, and taking advantage of terrain. 

I admire my good gaming friends for their Heroscape collection... but Nexus Ops works just fine as a Cliff-note sort of version in a much smaller package. Fun little game that I look forward to trying with 2v2 teams.

Update: Still haven't played this game with a lot of regularity, but every time I do, I enjoy it. Finally got a chance to play the team version, and it was a blast. There's wasn't a whole lot we could do to really help each other, but some of that might have been the hex layout. Still, rooting for another player and passing the occasional card to help adds a nice element. Not a lot of games handle teams well, and this one does.

Update: having traded for the fantasy flight version of the game I can say that I like it slightly better. I don't care if the minis don't glow in the dark :) the tile artwork could be better but the slight variants are a nice add.

Excellent, fairly simple tactical combat game w/ a neat sci-fi theme.  The random nature of the board and the ability to purchase your units makes the game extremely replayable.  My Brother and I found that the gummy-like pieces were a little off putting at first, but they grew on us in the span of just one game.  One detail that I found especially neat was that the more powerful and larger units actually have little human riders on them (which are hard to spot at first glance).  The production quality is pretty good.

Build armies of alien units for hex based combat. The dual sided board has very different middles, which changes the gameplay dramatically. The main thrust of the game is that the board is so small, especially as it's dominated by one of those middle areas, that you have to constantly push forward against both flanking players or else you'll get knocked out too quick. The small battlefield seems much more a bonus than a penalty here, as I'm normally not one for long drawn out war games.

RATING: 3
Looks cool under a black light...dice battle game with twists added by cards...more balanced than Risk...did I mention it looks cool under a black light...

Seriously though, this game suffers from the same problem that Risk and many other games of this type suffer from. When a game relies on resource attrition due to direct player interaction, the game will tend to be intrinsically broken if there are more than two players playing. The victory point missions notwithstanding, this principle holds true in most cases and it does with this game.

Who needs Risk when you have this

small map +
varied units +
objectives +
short game length ++

when I want to play Risk (which is admittedly not vary often) I play this instead.

Update: Who needs Twilight Imperium when you can just play this. It seems that old Nexus Ops does a way better job trying to capture the spacey combat TI3 ever could ( and as a quick rebuttal to those who would disagree, if TI3 wasn't a combat game then why is the ENTIRE focus of the game (besides the objectives, which don't involve combat at all, paradoxically) revolve around ships and army men, getting resources (to build ships and army men), tech (to upgrade ships and army men), laws (to restrict/reward ships and army men) and on and on!)

Nexus Ops just does everything right, the combat, the high luck factor, varied objectives and perfect game length conspire to make this easily my favorite light wargame.

RATING: 5
The colours are quite garish, and your fate is very tightly tied to the overall feasibility of the special missions cards that you draw, but this is a fast playing Risk variant done just about right with just the right mix of complexity and speed. I really can never rate a game like this very highly because your ability to play it "well" is more or less your ability to roll the dice well and to play to your hand as well as possible (and to draw the right cards at the right time), but it's not a bad little game all told. The victory point mechanism as such is a very good idea as it makes the game finish out much faster than similar style games which alone makes this something I'm much more likely to sit down to. That said, the novelty for this game seems like it'll be short, and that the cards and situations will start to feel very samey with very many plays. I have to quibble about the random mine distribution as well, like Eagle's War it can be overly generous / stingy and that can really affect the chances of players because income is so very important. All of this said, the randomness of this game is relatively acceptable given the genre (American Light War Dice-Chucker) that plays out quickly, but it isn't enough to really engage me that much either.

Seeing the posted images of this game under a black light increases my rating from a 6 to a 7 (very cool, must try). Axis and Allies combat mechanic in a Risk type strategy atmosphere. The victory point scoring keeps the game short (otherwise would be brutal back and forth gameplay, ugh). Team play may be interesting but haven't tried yet.

My kids (7 and 10 years old) love this game.

I played Memoir '44 on Thursday and my first game of Nexus Ops on Friday.  Nexus feels like a lighter version of Memoir with a SF theme, more randomness, and a Risk feel. I enjoy piling up units and rampaging across the countryside.  It was fun to watch each other save up Rubium to buy dragons and attempt to beat the crap out of each other.  The secret mission cards add an interesting twist but are hard to keep track of during play.  I "won"our game by getting two victory points for winning a battle on a forest hex, which seemed excessively generous, so I traded the card for Rubium instead and we continued to play, with the game coming down to a final battle consisting of my two dragons vs. my opponent's rockstrider and dragon.  He barely won the battle, beating me by one victory point, and we had one of those game box/tv commercial moments with loud shouts and fist pumping, etc. so that was cool.  My six year old played with us and did ok (we will give him a six point handicap next game) but I was too busy figuring the game out to help him as much as I should have.  He started off strong but then got greedy,following a mining strategy and hoarding dragons, which didn't get him a lot of points. A fun game!

Don't spend your last gaming dollar on it, but try it sometime. It is a pleasant, if not riveting, way to spend an hour or two.

Another recent addition based on recommendations seen here.  My son is really enjoying this one, though he likes to make up his own variant (one of his favorite new words - he likes to do things his own way) without using the cards.  We need a few more plays to get the flow of this one - I expect it will remain popular.

RATING: 7.5
Played once so far, with 4 players. Great fun. 

Light combat game. Easy to learn. Nice miniatures. Unique (garish?) colors. A mix of units each with different costs, and different pros and cons. Felt a bit like a board game version of Starcraft, except everyone has identical units available to them. A fair amount of complexity. Game board will be different every time. The objective cards, special action cards, terrain effects, initial exploration tile goodies, and "king of the hill" element add to the fun.

The first couple turns were a land grab, but battle lines quickly stagnated. Then it was all about fighting lots of little battles for victory points. If you like sweeping across the board and gaining territory, this game isn't for you (at least with 4 players). Some gamers will dislike all the dice rolling.  Took longer than expected - about 2 hours I think. Sure it's derivative - but it's fun, so who cares.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Fun game, but the victory points from special mission cards make the game a little too random.  Winning the game never feels as satisfying as it would if you truly crushed your opponents.

RATING: 3
Free-for-all whack-your-neighbor is one thing. Randomized resources on the map, random secret missions, super random combat is just way too much for me. "But it's fun" they say. I guess that's where we diverge on opinions of what's fun.

A smaller version of Risk, it is basically a dice battle game, but with cool mini's and a bit of economics.  As far as Dice games go it is a fun AT game.  Not our type of game. Added 7-5-07   TRADED 4-08

An absolute surprise ... primarily because it plays so tighly with three or more players.  Constant action, numerous devices that promote engaging the enemy, and an environment that promotes side deals and alliances that rise and fall like weak parlimentary coalitions.

Nothing really new here.  Just plain fun.

Borrows cool ideas from lots of genres... Ameritrash dicefest combat, Euro-ish economy and area control, CCG type event cards, which all comes together pretty well. The compact scale is nice, but ultimately the one-round combat and generally small unit totals makes the VP system a little finicky, since you have to completely eliminate the defender to score points.

RATING: 7
Played once with 2p.  Enjoyed it.  It's a nice lighter game.  Yes, there is dice rolling and a lot of chance with the card draws.  But not every game has to be Puerto Rico.  This is a good step up from Risk and not as stinking long as Axis & Allies.  Rating may go up after trying with more players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
This looks like something I would like.  Cool mini's with different strengths.  Fast game with unique objectives.  I have tried to like this a few times but found I just did not.  

Well, I figured it out.  The combat is very swing-e.  The dice rolls can kill you off quick and once someone started to dominate they can get the run away leader.  You have no control of the secret missions you get so another random thing.  Finally there is a lot of  take that in the game.

Too much randomness + Take that + run away leader = Not my kinda game

BTW:  Three player is the worst.  Not unlike other battlefield type of games it is easy to gang up on one player or for one player to turtle and wait till the other wound each other.

I love some things about this game - the "gain points by serving your corporate board's arbitrary goals" is both vastly entertaining and creates very different play than, eg, purely territorial or economic win conditions would.

Nonetheless, after about half a dozen games, it doesn't have a strong "want to keep playing" attraction. It might be a length-of-play issue, which often feels like it's a touch longer than it ought to be for the amount of stuff that actually happens. Might be solvable via speed play?

Luck obviously plays a role here, given all the dice rolling, but I don't see it as a problem.  Usually you're trying to set up battles to give yourself as good of a chance of winning as possible.  You can't guarantee you'll win, but there's strategy in maximizing the probability of a win.

Note that the rating reflects more on me than on the game.  It encourages going and bashing on people, because VPs are only gained when you're on the attack.  Turtling isn't useful.  It played pretty quickly (1.5 hours, including instructions, all four of us were new to the game).

It's just very much not my style of game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

This is a light area control game that plays in about an hour. I like the different troops and the cards to score objectives and how losing a battle gets you a card to help in the future. This is a dice rolling game so even a good strategy can but cursed with bad dice rolls and this can but punishing. There are some cards to help midigate some rolls but not enough to take into account that the main mechanic is dice rolling.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
An excellent sci-fi themed combat game of mayhem and carnage where aggressive play is rewarded and the only way to win.  Nexus Ops is quick to learn and whiles it plays well with 2, 3 or 4 players, my preference is for a 4-player game where chaos truly reigns and victories by stealth are the order of the day. This game is just begging for expansions.

Dudes on a map.  Dudes that glow in black light, that is...

This game is simple and straight-forward. Expand so you can buy even more guy to expand even further.  Beat up on your opponents to gain VPs.  Win.

Playing to take over more of the map than your opponents won't get you a win.  Instead, you have to make sure you play according to your Secret Missions.  It can be difficult to reign yourself in sometimes, but there are occasions where 6 Humans are more important to buy late in the game than one Dragon.

This game plays pretty quick, and it scratches that Risk itch that you sometimes get.  

We'll see if it has staying power.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
One of the best replacements for Risk out there.  Fun little light strategy game.  The point system encourages offensive play and really discourages turtling; if you aren't attacking someone on your turn there's a good chance you're doing something wrong ;)  Certainly a high random factor but games are always close and it's not hard to make a comeback.  Great fun all round.

A fast game with easy rules where interaction (battles) between players is impossible to avoid.

There is some confusion regarding the identification of some units (they are similar) and which units have moved or not in the same turn. The combat system can also get messy through the final stages of the game, where there are more troops involved.
My absolute debut failure in this game (for example, i didn´t realize at once that stronger units must be "escorted") don´t prevent me from concede that this is a game that provides a wide range of options and strategies. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
A decent Ameritrash, because it doesn't suffer from terribly long playtime.  The randomness of the dice is still frustrating.  Overall, there are some cool, unique mechanics and plenty of replayability.  I've only played 2-player so far.  I like how the various units are specialized and have their own functions and limitations.  Nice way to encourage combat with the Monolith.  It is difficult (as a new player) to keep track of and remember all the cards you have in your hand towards the middle of the game.  Finally, the bits are way cool (except for the cheap player reference cards)!

(2013)
"Dudes on a map" per 2-4 jugadors i 120 min.
Amb 3 partides no ha cuajat: tot i les mecàniques per 'compensar' els que van perdent, quan algú es posa al capdavant, sembla que es manté i és impossible aturar-lo (almenys a 2 jugadors).
=====
Amb 4 partides (3 a 2 jugadors) jo començo a veure-li moltes, moltes possibilitats. Les diferents unitats, diferents iniciatives, el factor terreny, etc pot donar tàcticament molt de sí.
A 2 és necessari que els dos rivals tinguin nivell similar, sinó es desequilibra massa.
A 3 o 4, es pot fer front comú i mirar de frenar al que s'avanci massa.
Efectivament el joc premia l'atac, però cal anar amb compte i no atacar "per què sí" provocant que després també t'ataquin i ells també puntuin.
=====
Amb 6 partides, definitivament li trobo el punt. El problema és que tinc ventatja (per tenir més partides) sobre els demés, i l'experiència compta més del que sembla.
Es poden fer punts de moltes maneres.
Descartar cartes inútils a canvi de cristall no és mala opció.
En la darrera partida, els meus dos últims torns foren de 6 i 5 punts.
A 2 jugadors segueixo tenint la sensació del Runaway leader (tot i que el King of the Hill podria solventar-ho).
=====
Amb 14 partides, la majoria a 2...... ufff, el joc mola i promet molt, però hi ha un patent efecte "runnaway leader". Si tens més terreny i més unitats i controles el monolit i l'altre no te'l pot arrabassar, està sentenciat. La bola de neu es fa gran i gran i no hi ha forma humana de parar-ho. 
Males tirades de daus als primers torns poden sentenciar la partida, deixant-te en una inferioritat que no pots recuperar.
Potser cal incloure algun mecanisme de catch-up com en Tash-Kalar...
=====
Variants per millorar a 2:
1) https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/491328/2-player-monolith-mod
Durant els primers 6 torns (usar un dau per contar), el monolit només dóna 1 carta d'Energia. Després ja 2. Això fa que algú amb sort de pillar rockstriders ocupi el monolit, es reforci amb cartes d'energia i es desequilibri la partida.
2) Meva. Monolit no dóna cartes d'Energia, només King of the Hill. El problema d'això és que no hi hauria batalla pel monolit que és l'essència.
3) Meva. Monolit dóna 2 cartes d'Energia al "ocupador" i 1 a l'altre.
4) Algo per compensar males tirades. Pensar.

I won this game the very first time I played it.  There were 4 players and 2 of them had played it before.  To me this means the game doesn't have much strategy to it.  In fact the strategy is pretty random based on the objective cards you get.  I never really felt I needed a long term strategy.  It's all about meeting the requirements of your objective cards.  I think I'd like this game better if there was a singular objective all the players had to achieve. With the objective cards serving as secondary battles on our way to the main goal.

* Fairly Modular board

What I didn't like:
* Expected it to play faster than it did
* Flimsy Monolith, nowhere "safe" to keep it in box either
* Hard to keep track of which of the 20 pieces you moved on your turn

Likes: Fun and quick, easy to teach, plays like a fast simplified version of Twilight Imperium, variable board set up and resource placement make for good replayability.

Dislikes: 2 player games can be boring, seems to be a set strategy each game, wish AH didn't give up on these types of games and released a few expansions - could have had a lot of potential.

In my head, I want to like Ameritrash games, but I was let down by this oft-hyped classic.

Nexus Op contains a lot of mechanics I normally don't like in games. You have direct conflict, randomly assigned action cards that let you break the rules or up your winning chances in a battle and a lot of dice rolls that can totally screw your plans. 

But somehow, Nexus Op manages to be fun for me. The game plays fast and normally, you are done with it within an hour. The gameplay is very tactical: It doesn't matter if you have lost the control of a tile or not as long as you can fulfill your secret mission cards. Sure, you can be hosted if you draw secret mission cards that you can't easily fulfill in your current situation, but coupled with the short playing time this isn't a problem for me. The whole game is about aggression, action efficiency and choosing your battles. Yeah, I would play this again.

Not played as much as my rating suggests.  Kids love the build-up phase, but don't want to continue once the fighting starts, so I've never completed a game.  I like the variability, lightness, rewarding odds and tactics, the look, and the ability to win with secret mission objectives.

A quick game with interesting units and lots of fighting is worth two thinking cube counter games sometimes.  Love the varied objectives, and how the scoring accelerates as you get enough objectives to score combos.

RATING: 6
This is a good substitute for Risk as it plays a lot quicker.  The secret mission cards are imbalanced a bit but still work out pretty good.  Though in the end, this becomes a bit of "bash the weak guy" in order to score VPs.  So you have one player just getting beat up bad, one or two other players doing the beating, and potentially a 4th player growing armies unchecked.  Still worth breaking out once in awhile with the right crowd (dicethrowers/wargamers).  Nexus Ops actually reminded me of Twighlight Imperium 2...except it is better in that it rewards action rather than penalizing it.

RATING: 8
Players represent mining corporations trying to extract minerals from a planet, and beat up the competition.  A good old fashioned, die rollin', beat 'em up game.  Players take turns mining money, spending the money on troops, moving the troops, attacking other players, and hopefully fulfilling victory conditions.  A player wins if they can reach twelve victory points.  Victory points are earned if they win a battle (1) or achieve a secret mission - and this is the clever bit.  Secret missions are...secret, so even if you're being hammered into extinction, a clever build phase and a bold attack can still net you victory points.  Fast, simple, fun -  and the glowing miniatures don't hurt either.  A nice surprise.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
This game has a lot of things I love.  I love the graphic design, the modular board, the cool components, the strategic decision making, the units and their abilities, the win condition, etc. It also scales well from 2 to 4 players. The only complaint is that sometimes the secret mission cards can be too random. Sometimes you draw one that goes perfectly with your current position or is already accomplished, sometimes you draw one that you won't be able to achieve.

Edit: I sometimes forget the rule about discarding a card to get 1 Rubium. This somewhat balances the concern above, you can discard unattainable secret missions to get more rubium.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The best yet of the A&A-derivative or Risk 2210-style games ever made. You are handed a growing pile of mission cards which only give you VP's for attacking... pushing the game quicky to a violent and speedy conclusion. Genius! It is a succesful version of Twilight Imperium, but with a corny theme and it plays in 2 hours instead of 6!

I love this game. It is a very simple territory control war game. The rules are streamline and it plays similar to an RTS video game (only turn base). The game is also rather fast. Lots of minis. I do wish that each player had a unique faction, but that is minor. Expansions would be amazing.

One of my favorite "Ameritrash" games.  This game isn't just a dice roll fest.  There is some strategy in this game that makes it a great game to play.

It takes just about the right amount of time to play, and has some elements of a Eurogame with victory points and and the victory conditions, but with some attacking dice combat that reminds you of Axis and Allies.

Don't eat the gummi bits.  This is a really fun, fast dice combat game with an RTS flavor and a nice king of the mountain mechanic, and offense is encouraged.  If you want the TI:3 experience, but in a tenth of the time, this is the game for you. I'd always choose this over Risk or Axis&Allies. There's good reason to believe that this game will be highly sought after in 10 years, much the way that Titan was before its reprint.

Like Risk, but way better. Scales well for a 2, 3 or 4-player game, and plays very quickly. The unit and terrain variety make for a more varied experience, and the objectives system keeps it from becoming a simple land-grab.

When I first got the game I wasn't sold. I felt like I wanted more to the game. I wanted a more epic feel. I wanted more complexity. This was during a time where I was still exploring boardgames and wasn't sure what I wanted and I didn't appreciate the game for what it was. That was a mistake. Now that I've come around, identified what I really want from gaming and what I want my games to look like this game captures at lot of those desired traits. Fantastic game and I'm a little frustrated with myself for trading off (but subsequently reacquired when I realized the error of my ways).

RATING: 8
Army versus army combat is rarely appealing to me. Making it objective-based goes a long way towards getting my interest piqued. Bringing in the perfect mix of area control, interesting abilities, underdog card effects and really diverse goals to achieve and you've finally gotten me to enjoy an army versus army game.

This one has not seen nearly the amount of love that it deserves and I'm going to make sure I see more rounds of it played. You should do the same thing - it's an excellent game.

A quick and fun little game that reminds me of the Starcraft PC game. No, it's not the old AH, but when they are making games that are this much fun, who cares? (and this coming from a wargamer).

 I don't care for the plastic minis- the neon colors are too garish. They smell nice though. :-)  

The components are very well done in general, excepting the monolith which is CRAP, and brought my rating down half a point. The hexes themselves, as well as the cards, are good quality. 

Overall, a solid and enjoyable game.

RATING: 7
Good basic dice-rolling combat game, if a bit generic-feeling.  A huge advantage is that it is one of the very few dice-rolling multiplayer wargames that is playable within about 2 hours or less.  Secret mission card victory points are fun, if somewhat too random sometimes-- your success greatly depends on these missions being easy for you to complete.  The most common way the game bogs down is if someone uses a defensive strategy against you and gathers a ton of cheap units in a hex on your border, which are impossible to eliminate in one combat round-- so that you can't complete most missions or get VPs.

An intergalactic battle over Rubium mines with a mysterious energizing Monolith which could hold the key to victory,  I realize that's not a complete sentence, but it's the closest I could come to capture the essence of the Ops.

Wow. This was a lot better than I expected. After the initial couple of rounds of turning over tiles, this really flies. Quick battles in a tight space.

Very aggressive game that can feel personal when playing with three and a younger crowd - left my youngest in tears.

This to me is what the Starcraft board game should have been. I know there are a fair number of fans of the Starcraft board game but for me this is what I was looking for. The combat does have dice involved but the way in which dice rolls are resolved based on the units involved, it's quite well done. So well done in fact that I believe it's similar to what Galactic Emperor used when it was released. If I want to play a light combat game for ameritrashers, this is a good choice.

For me, lots of great bits did not make up for uninspired game play. The core of the game is a move/fight/collect money system that is classic Ameritrash fare. The game's theme failed to engage my imagination. Rating of 3.75 is a composite of my rating (4.5) and my sister's rating (3).

I didn't like the game well enough to invest in a black light bulb, but if you do, and you're concerned with safety when exposed to UV-A radiation, check out UV protective glasses.

For its genre, I think it's decent enough. There's a "Who Dares Win" element and the game doesn't encourage turtling. The secret objective cards keeps the game short and prevents Risk-like never-ending stories, although they are probably not very well-balanced. Certain combos would pretty much guarantee a win.

[1 play] Typical game of smiting with different units on different terrains, etc.--this time with luminous futuristic space monsters!  Less thematic though it may be, I actually like the fact that you win the game on points rather than via world domination.  We played the team version (2 against 2), which I'm not sure I appreciate the greatness of.  It seems like there's not all that much you and your ally can do to cooperate.  This was an unobjectionable game; I wouldn't seek it out, but wouldn't mind playing again.

This game alone makes Twilight Imperium looks like unwieldy, cumbersome 4x game (and I really like Twilight Imperium).
Nexus Ops is hybrid of wargame and 4X stripped down to essence, and what a glorious essence it is.
This game is true evergreen. I expect it will never fade away.

Somewhere between Risk and a RTS game on computer.

The different unit types and how they interact are interesting, the secret missions creating shifting sands in the gameplay and while there is strategy, players are still ultimately at the mercy of the dice.

Still it is more strategic, far more interesting and much shorter than Risk.  I feel I need more plays to finalize my opinion on this game.

Nexus Ops was one of my first purchases after deciding to get into the hobby. I've played the game a handful of times and while it's solid, it never took off for my group. A large part of this is due to the random hex distribution. If one player (or team as in our last game) gets high value mines close to their home, it's extremely hard and frustrating to overcome.

It also seems we can't go a single game without discovering a couple turns later that a unit entered an illegal spot or is illegally running a mine. Repeated plays would eventually cement this in our heads, but the game has a couple of these rules that are easily messed up in the heat of battle

All said and done, with so many other great area-control conflict games out there, Nexus Ops is never a first choice for my group.

Aside from the obvious reasons to own the game (cool looking bits and rarity) this game plays very well too.  There is a fair bit of luck, but also a good bit of strategy.

RATING: 9
Based on 10 plays.
+ The ruleset is elegant, streamlined, and intuitive
+ Just everything that is needed, nothing more
+ The figures have both unique physical shape to be easily recognizable and unique skills to be interesting game-wise.
> I haven't seen much use for "black light", although glowing figures is a cool idea.
- Beating the weakest player is sometimes the best thing to do: easier battles, easier victory points.

Update after two years and 10 plays: 8-->9. Rarely have I seen such a good set of rules.

Since 2009, updated Dec 2011

I didn't really know what to expect from this game when I opened it, but after just one play I can already tell this is going to be played many more times.  It reminds me a lot of games like Command & Conquer for PC strategy games, but in a board game format.  Basically you take over terrain and mine it it to earn funds.  With your funds you can build an army and take over more terrain.  All the players are trying to do this, so eventually you'll get into some excellent battles.  The winning mechanism of victory points for completing special missions drawn from the cards or pummelling opponents makes this game a wonderful challenge and a lot of fun!

A fun little combat game, but highly dependant on luck. Colorful bits and random tile placement make the replay value a little higher than it would've been otherwise. Nice light fare for people without the time or desire to learn complicated rules and strategy.

RATING: 7.1
Black light war game.  Reminds me of my childhood King-of-the-Hill games.  Have substituted colored crystals for the money chips earned from mines which adds to the very alien flavor of the game.  Knowing the cards that can be played to bolster attacks or defense is always helpful, but isn't as important to winning as in let's say, El Grande.  I don't play frequently & when I lost thought it was more that the dice were against me in battle, not that I didn't know the cards well enough.  Card stands are useful for this game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Quick Risk spinoff which does a good job of pushing the players into conflict relentlessly.  The mission cards are a nice touch to speed up the game; outright elimination isn't usually a thing for me.  I find there is subtlety in how to deploy your forces to minimize the opportunities for the opponent to score on easy victories.

This game is fun.  The pieces look cool and the rules are actually very easy to learn.  We set our victory point goal level below the standard value when we need a shorter game.  This is game is interesting enough that we often play more than one consecutive game.

I own the original game and much prefer the cool looking creature figures over the new one by FFG.  However, I don't much care for the flimsy Monolith that goes in the center.  I think Fantasy Flight Games got that change right on the new edition.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
I'm starting to think 3 players is the sweet spot for this game. With two players, you won't really need to worry about income.  In a four-player game, you'll only want to buy lava leapers and rubium dragons if you need them to fulfill a Secret Mission card.  The team rules are a good idea, but we had to fudge a bit the time we tried them.

Glad to see the FFG re-print. I will probably cannibalize the optional rules from that version for when we play: King Of The Hill, Vortex and Alternate Units all look like fun variants that we could drop in easily.

It's a blast!  I really like the colors and artwork on the tiles and board hexes.  The box art is one of my favorites of all time- great color.  The minis have nice shapes and color as well.  It's simple and a nice mix of fighting, exploring and card play. It's really well designed and come from behind victories are possible.  I keep trying to play it by gaining territory and spawning huge armies (wargame fashion) but my son beats me by satisfying the mission cards.  Pay attention to the cards! Game length is just right as well.  Good, light family battle game.  Clear rules with no headaches!  I love the way losers of a battle get free power-up cards, and the game self balances.  It looks much better in person that in photos on the geek.  It's unique and one of a kind, a keeper for my collection.

I enjoyed this more than I thought I would.  In fact, the only thing keeping me from rating it higher is the fact that the mission cards that determine your victory points demand shorter term tactical, vs. longer term strategic, play.  It's a bit hard to plan for getting victory points in future turns.

Great in it's own style. The spoils of discovery encourages quick contact between opponents, and the scoring rewards agressive tactics. Therefore you really get what you're after: a quick skirmish game! Not devoid of luck, and the fight mechanics are very simple, but the game still offers a few tactical choices. It has the feeling of an american game but unusually clean and simple mechanics.

I own it for a decade now and it´s still fun.

Light wargame. It is like a mix of Twilight Imperium 3rd ed. "lite" and Risk. It is fairly simple and with some randomess included, but it has enough strategy to be much more interesting than any Risk version. It also plays very quickly, with little downtime.

I might have won even though I had almost no army left, simply by playing the "start a battle" cards

FFG version

A light-medium wargame/unit placement game with hidden goals. Does luck factor in? Yes, but that just means you have to adapt your strategies as you play. There are some pretty strategic elements without being too overbearing. Replay-ability is pretty good too. Modular board config and a host of optional rules \
Components are great, as usual, and its just fun having all those monsters duke it out. 
In the games I've played, its always come close and there is a real joy scoring a bunch of points in one turn and coming out from behind.

This is a really good fighting game. The theme makes sense and makes the rules easy to understand. The whole system is streamlined and the game plays quickly.

First play--this was a great game, we enjoyed it.  Nice bits (except for that horrible monolith thing).  Gameplay was reminiscent of a mix between Warcraft (the computer game) and Samurai Swords (with the tiered combat system and scaling cost/efficiency of troops).

From a grognards point of view this game just lacks something. Think of it as 1 part Twilight Imperium and 3 parts Settlers of Catan. It's a SF tile game with an arbitrary victory level. Instead of various resources, there are various builds. However, just when things get interesting the game ends because someone has been declared the winner. Victory Points are earned for various things, many generated by cards, which can't be cancelled. So victory has not a lot to do with the tactical situation at the end of the game. In fact, an alliance of players could have turned back the leader and even pushed him to the edge of elimination, but as he accumulated VP early on he could still be declared the victor by the play of one last card.

Nexus Ops is a straight-forward, simple dice-chucker battle game (almost in the style of Risk) but has some elements of Axis & Allies as well (extremely simplified, of course). Beautiful looking game! The AH edition is gorgeous in regular light and even more mysterious in black-light! The game play is pleasant as well. It loses a few points for having a somewhat random and imbalanced mission completion mechanic.  You can end up with some crappy missions to complete while your opponent has a few strong ones that are easy to complete.  Some of the rules regarding card play also feel like they weren't really well-considered before publication.  That being said, I like Nexus Ops for being incredibly atmospheric and it has several things in it which are perfectly fine for this sort of game.  I just wish the Missions were a little more balanced.

This is a high-conflict game, which isn't usually my style, but it works very well. There is a very short lead time as players build up forces, and then you're into the struggle to earn VPs in battle. It moves quickly, and there are no complicated rules. The "VPs for specific objectives" mechanism requires players to attack each other, but doesn't require them to crush the weakest player, so even if you're losing it's not necessarily in the other players' interests to crush you.

For what it is, Nexus Ops does a good job.  If I am ever in the mood for a kill 'em all game, this or Monsters Menace America will get my nod (Titan aside).  Nothing exceptional, but the relatively short play time, and the well balanced units make this game enjoyable, though never to be thought of as anything too deep. The forced aggression is a nice touch, as many war games generate too much turtling.  Luck of the draw for mission cards can cause a slanted outcome, but the short playing time allows this to be ok - as it never pretends to be taken too seriously.

Fun introductory battle game that involves controlling resources (crystals) and building units, using a simplified A&A system. Once kids or newbies are introduced to this, there are far better games to play. I, for one, would rather play a longer game with a theme that I more enjoy and is a bit less silly. The other detractor is the hideous design of the tiles- horrendous, however the tiles make for a new setup each game.

I like this game. I enjoy the tactics and don't mind the luck and hidden goals. Unfortunately this game seems to have a huge issue. In a two player game the first player seems to always win (gets first to the monolith and then gets energize card advantage. I'm planning on making some rules changes to fix that (player holding the monolith gets only one card). Also I'm planning on trying this game with non random set-up.

It gives a StarCraft feel.

RATING: 5.5
Overall, not impressed with this one.  RISK-like conquest wargame with a production phase tied in.  The simplicity of this game cannot be ignored, and perhaps even admired since FFG usually has a "bigger and longer is better" approach.  However, for such a short game the luck-of-the-draw aspects for victory cards and production tiles is not near tight enough.  With the right random conditions one side will have a clear advantage.  Also, highly disagree with the high theme rank of this game.  Honestly, what theme?

For what it is, it could not be better.  

Couldn't resist the TRU sale on this one.  There is a lot going on in this game, and there are definitely random factors to deal with (it's war afterall) but Nexus fills a niche of a decent 2 to 4 player conflict game that has great entertainment value and tough decisions.  There are elements of both strategy and tactics in this clever game.

Obtained from Toys R Us for about 20 bucks.

Very good game for its type, with interesting, tight, quick gameplay. However, just a warning, out of two sets I owned previously, BOTH spelled violently of plastic, enough to give all my players headaches and to force a trade.

Nexus Ops does right what Twilight Imperium does wrong.  N.O. encourages you to "mix it up" with the other players.  You _won't_ win by sitting back and "turtle-ing".  The only problem with the game is the luck of the draw for special mission cards.  get the right ones, and you have a much easier time of winning.  still, a very fun tactical war game, with cool pieces.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.5
Simple, light, colorful, sci-fi wargame, that plays tactically, not epic or strategically. Nothing really impressed me about the gameplay as it is largely derivitive of other simple wargames.  There aren't a lot of die rolls, so if you get upset at odd luck, you'll probably dislike it.  Also, you may find the Euro-scoring mechanism of victory points for random cards unappealing or out of place in a beat-em-up game like this --there's no reason to attack your enemy's base for example, due to this scoring mechanism.

Pros:  Short, fairly simple and fun for what it is.  If you want to  battle in a sci-fi setting rolling dice then this is a good game for you.Cons:  Random placement of dicoveries and distribution of secret mission cards can make the game a bit too easy to win for one side or another.  First player has an advantage that at the end of the game they may get an extra turn to get to 12 VP as the game ends as soon as someone has 12 VP.

RATING: 9
Great components, clean, straightforward gameplay. First player to 12 points wins, and the only way to get points is to fight, so no turtling or being reluctant allowed.

So far this is my favorite among the newer AH games.

Update: After more recent plays, I *still* like it. :)

Entertaining, if unchallenging sci-fi wargame. For a more challenging option I would choose something like Dust. Plays equally well from my experience with 2, 3 or 4 players, and the semi-random nature of the board prevents predictable planning after several plays. Simple rules, and the only game I own that can be played easily by blacklight!

Acquired July 2008 - Extremely simple "wargame".  Suggest 3 or 4 players as with 2 players there is a runaway leader problem.  Controlling the Monolith is extremely valuable and in 2-player game a few turns of controlling it will lead to inevitable victory.  Energize cards can be very strong.  Good mechanic to reward the loser of the battle.

The dice and cards add just enough luck without being too chaotic.  The 6 creatures work well with the landscapes.  All having a benefit, penalty, bonus, or some kind of restriction.  
Shame that the translucent pieces kept me from this game for so long.  I know that a lot of people like them; but I like the  more detailed sculpts in the new FFG reprint.  [-]Will be picking this up for sure.[/-]

Update: Got it!
The new minis are great.  
The tiles not so much though.  They look too busy and look almost like a bad screen saver from old an version of Windows.  
The cards are an improvement.  With better artwork and simplified by eliminating "only one red victory card can be player per battle won" and "a mission card can be played after winning a battle only as long as a secret mission card wasn't played"

WAY AWESOME. Outrageously over-the-top cliche science fiction theme. Lots of dice battling and some tricks to learn. So many pieces: gets messy and you'll constantly be forgetting to claim victory point cards for winning battles and failing to recognise you are achieving missions. Not to be taken seriously. Game is inevitably won by the person who is least forgetful. Rad-as bright fluro alien pieces act as apologies for the shamelessly luck-driven battle process. RISK with a starship troopers theme and unit differentiation.

This is a really fun little space monster battle themed game. I wouldn't normally like this kind of game except that the gameplay is different. Instead of a game that takes forever to play and people turtle up in their home base areas, this one is all about going out and grabbing VPs from different spaces and conditions according to scoring cards you draw. This means there is tons of player interaction and all out attacking. 

I also love the dayglo pink and green and blue alien bugs! Fantastic pieces. The only part that is lame is the central circle - I forget what they call it, but a lot of people replace that central tile with something else as I am sure I will.

A goofy-themed game with some ridiculous names (Liquifungus Forests?), but excellent playability.

One play with four players. It's an interesting twist on multiplayer wargames in that your goals are, for the most part, short-term rather than long-term, so while it lacks that desirable "grand strategy" feel, the game doesn't get bogged down the way slugfests usually do. The "king of the hill" aspect is a nice extra element and it seems well-implemented--the bonus is worth fighting for but not so powerful that it makes a player unstoppable, and furthermore it ties up some of your stronger units which could otherwise be attacking and getting you VP. The only negative was that my one playing ended up taking somewhere between two and two and a half hours. Despite the fact that this isn't my preferred type of game, overall I enjoyed Nexus Ops and would be happy to play it every now and then. One other thing--ordinarily I am completely indifferent to miniatures, but even I have to admit that the translucent day-glo monsters are pretty neat.

I played once with four people, and it seemed a bit too defense-heavy.  Everyone spent a lot of their time simply turtling.  Everyone had strong defense forces, so nobody could mount any successful attacks to win battles, and winning battles is the main way you get victory points.  That said, the units are interesting (and cute), and there's definitely a game in there somewhere.  Perhaps it's better with two players or in teams.  As it stands, if one player has a tendency to leave spaces with just one unit, players near him or her can rack up easy victory points, while other players may need to just hope that they get good random mission cards.

 The components look great and my flip through the rules make it look simple and a lot of fun.    Don't be fooled by the 11 page rulebook, this would be a 1/2 pager without the illustrations and examples.  Very simple ruleset.  Still hasn't made it to my table.

RATING: 10
This game makes me happy. It is a great mix of a "killin' stuff" game and a resource management game. The energize and secret mission cards are never overpowered and do a lot to make it so there are various strategies. It's theme is excellent and its components are perfect for it. And it is short enough to make the table pretty often. Simple enough rules to teach anyone. My rating of 8 is conservative. I have only played 2 games so far so I may be overly enamored. But I see very little here that isn't to like. 
UPDATE: No, I was right after more plays. This game rocks so hard.

RATING: 6.5
More thoughtful than it looks after reading the rules. The secret mission mechanism does a good job of allowing players to remain close even if it looks like a blowout. The varying abilities of the units, and the number of them that end up on the board, can cause paralysis... The components are overkill - plastic pieces made the board too full, and the monolith is just plain silly-looking (and impractical), even if control of it is crucial to winning the game. And what the heck is the point of those yellow cardboard strips that come with the game???

RATING: 10
After a few plays now, this just gets better! Plenty deep enough for me with non-stop action pretty much from the outset. Self-balancing rules (battle winners get VPs, loser get consolation) means it should be a pretty close run thing right down to the wire. Subsequently upped rating to one of my few 10's.

RATING: 7.5
Fast and furious little tactical game. There's quite some luck (well, at least randomness, but it can be luck) in what objectives you get and which event cards you draw, some of them are pretty situational and help you win the game in some situations, while being pretty useless in others.

Nevertheless, the game rewards tactical planning and even strategical thinking, with the different hexes benefiting different kinds of troops, and the combat system is fittingly fast, and both fair and, again, highly random.

Ultimately, while it's hard to take the game seriously both due to the miniatures and due to all the randomness, it certainly can be a lot of fun.

Also, the game nicely accomodates 2-4 players easily. Works well with 3, too, because relocating troops is so easy that there rarely is a runaway leader that the two others, if cooperating explicitly or implicitly, can't slow him down.

RATING: 7.5
Based one one solo play alone, I still rate this very highly, and I'm so glad I got a hold of a copy (in any condition, but especially pristine!)

The game plays quickly, with Mining syndicates buying units and exploring spaces to mine and recruit and then harvesting Rubium for more capital to increase their forces.

But the game objectives force a dynamic attack to gain secret victory points, mostly from combat situations. Players can't be sure what will aid their opponents, and must move and attack as they can to increase their own chances of winning.

It's fast moving Ameritrash fun, and it's a dynamite game, with fantastic components.

It was a big deal for me to buy three unknown board games when Heroscape was all I would purchase and play for many years.

I love this game. The bits are of course very oool.

RATING: 8
Picked this up at the new reduced price, and was very pleasantly surprised by this game. Small random board forces conflict, the pieces are hard for me to distinguish (legally blind) yet are still neat, and the game is more complex than it might first appear without delving into the feel of older wargames I've grown out of because I no longer want to spend half a day in chit hell. 

I would even call this game elegant - in its setup, crisp rules, very functional playmats, and pretty neat Energize/Secret Mission cards. Because you are playing for victory points and not really territory (you do need mines, but this isn't a typical territory-grab), it quickens the game pace and adds reasonable random fun.

I think of Nexus Ops as an intro to wargaming with cool bugs. I have really begun to hate playing wargames with egocentric paralysis of analysis odd people, and thankfully, this game will not appeal to those kind of gamers. Only drawback is that you are limited to a 4-player max, but a very pleasant surprise nonetheless.

I can't believe stores are trying to give this away! I got mine from Funagain for $13, and it was worth every penny. Many people call this Twilight Imperium Light. Your operations are driven by the secret mission cards, and since this is a race for victory points, turtling is not an option. The variable board changes making each game different. The cardboard for the board is a tad thin, but the neon-glow pieces are absolutely fantastic! Combat is a la Axis and Allies, but there is a order of battle where the more powerful pieces attack first, possibly taking out weaker pieces before they can counter-attack. Then there is the mysterious monolith, which dispenses "energizer" cards that can unpredictably, and significantly alter the course of battle. Lots of fun, and highly recommended wargaming fun within 90 minutes.

Update (08/11/09) 4 plays: Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant. The best of Twilight Imperium, Axis & Allies, and Settlers. Fast, brutal action, with nail-biting suspense as the players race to 12 VP. The monolith is key. The objective cards drive the game, compelling players to take great risks and sacrifices just to satisfy the cards, meaning that turtling isn't an option. If this kind of "feel" could be expanded to a 6P version, with a more galactic theme, this type of game would surely be the TI3-killer.

Update (06/18/10): Have managed to get several non-wargamers hooked on this game. I think it would make a great gateway to more complex wargames. But who am I kidding? This is wargaming perfection that is accessible to everybody... and the pieces are cool.

Update (07/24/12) 16 plays: Let's not beat around the bush--this is a GREAT game, easily bound to be one of the "classics". 3-4 years later, it is still highly regarded in my circle. The simplicity of the rules reminds me of the clean, straightforward rules of the classic Milton Bradley games, but with the intensity and sophistication of more current Euro/Ameritrash designs. Who thought you could pack this much fun, tactics, and strategy within 60-90 minutes?!?

Bought cheap-ish in NY. Not a bad game, though control of the monolith is a bit TOO crucial really. Feels more modular and open-ended than it really is, and rock-paper-scissors battle mechanic is okay for a light game, but not particularly satisfying. The ideal strategy seems to be to get hold of the monolith and don't attack, because you'll force your opponent to do so, meaning they get no energy cards from battles and you get extras for the monolith. The game really turns on energy cards.

Usually Ameritrash overwhelms me with rules and dozens of poorly thought out subgames and decks of cards. Most wargames are simpler -- and shorter -- than most Ameritrash. But I like multiplayer smash-em-up games every now and then. Nexus Ops scratches that itch perfectly. It does a great job of providing balance via its "loser gets a card" mechanism and the hidden goals discourage turtling. I like the "one round of combat" -- gives a nicer feel than combat to the death; gives you a chance to bring in reinforcements and recover from a streak of bad rolls. An unlucky distribution of the exploration tiles can tilt the balance of favor (if the same person gets all the spiders, for instance) and players need to understand the necessity of early, aggressive expansion. Those are about the only downsides I've found so far.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
If you absolutely hate risk you are unlikely to be impressed with this. The combat is like Axis and Allies but it is saved by the mechanics of the secret missions making this game both quick and not suffer too much from either bash the leader or the winner become obvious long before the game ends. The fact that you are after points not territory means that the usual bash the leader issues are not so important here. Nor can players be peaceful and win. You must fight and make enemies to gain the bulk of your points.

A bit chaotic, which is not necessarily a bad thing (but this can be mitigated by using a different set of optional rules). I played this two times (2 players or 4 players), but I can really see this playing well with three players. I also imagine easy ways to reduce the degree of randomness by introducing house roles, if you don't find a setup which suits your taste. First impression is favorable, favors agression between player and plays quite fast, too.

This is such a great game. Not too complicated and room for strategy - plus a fair amount of dice rolling. The monolith matters - but wont kill you if you cant control it. Rubium is good to have but lack of it wont cost you the game - its all about how you play those Victory Point Cards!

This game is quick to set up and only takes about an hour to play with two people. The game is very exciting from the beginning with you and your opponent/s quickly expanding your territory and claiming mines and allies. The game heats up even more in no time at all. Because of the small board you and your opponent/s must continuously use strategic movements to attack your opponent's weak spots while maintaining a defensive primeter. This game is excellent, even my dad who doesn't really like wargames will play this with me. I strongly recommend this game.

This was pretty awesome, actually. It solves the problems of multiplayer wargames by putting a nearly impassible obstacle in the middle of the board, and avoids both dicefest burnout and hopeless slog issues by being quite short (in fact, its length is about perfect) and making the granularity of points such that playing cards is significant enough to help players catch up to those that may appear to have a large lead.  Components are unusual and interesting to look at and touch, the luck factor feels completely natural, and the decisions are important but not absolute.  This game is very engaging, lots of fun--and it is not stressful at all.  I had a great time. I'm also intrigued by the possibility of partnership play.(2 plays)

A light Risk-style warfare game with a modular board, different units with special abilities and a stupid elevated tile ("The Monolith") that makes packaging the game difficult.

Did I mention the figures also glow in dark?

First played May 29th, 2008. Taught in 15-20 min, played in about 2 hours. This has a good luck/strategy ratio, however it takes a little longer to play than I was expecting. The goal is to be the first to get 12 VPs. You get these by winning battles or fufilling secret mission cards. The starting player gets $8 and each following player gets $3 more than the previous. Board has hexes of rock, Liquifungus Forest, Magma(near center), and Monolith(center). Each player has three hexes as a home base where units are placed and have a fixed income if occupied of $2, $3, and $2. Each hex unexplored has either a free spider to join your side, a $1 income and a (Crystalline or Fungoid), or $2 income. Units are(cost/die roll): Humans(2/6), Fungoids(3/5), Crystalline(3/5), Rock Striders(5/4), Lava Leapers(8/3), Rubium Dragon(12/2). Units can only move one space nomally. Striders can move twice if they move through or onto a rock hex. On your turn you buy units, move units, reveal unexplored tiles, battle, collect money(all occupied mines), and get a secret mission card. If you control the Monolith, you get two Energize cards(give special abilities). During battle, units are rolled from top cost down and enemies are removed before the next round of units goes. If the battle is decided you can play a mission card with a red VP value if applicable, otherwise take a blue 1VP. You may also play any number of white VP cards.

Update:  Possibly broken.  The first player wins 90% of the time regardless of the number of players.  Perhaps the money handicapping should be ramped up a bit more to compensate?  I suppose it could have everything to do with mine placement too...

I love this manic little battler. It's an all out balls to the wall fighter. There is no time to take a breath or build up defenses. There is a ton of luck, and yet it is a very cool strategic resource game. You have to gather money and cards as well as manage your units into a force that achieve goals every turn.

Plays fast. Hits Hard.

To me, it feels like a simplified version of Twilight Imperium (a good thing).  Another one of the good games that the new Avalon Hill company made.  It's too bad they have discontinued this game as it was really good.  

And the bits for it are freeking awesome!!  Who doesn't love glow in the dark aliens.  There should be a special place in hell for people who feel the need to paint these pieces (no matter what their painting skills might be like).

It is a fast and fun light evening game with plenty of bits and plenty of dice, but with some opportunities for real strategy, despite its rather random play. I think it is best with 3 to 4 players;  I don’t think it would be as nearly as fun with two players.

A solid light multiplayer combat game with semirandom secret victory point goals. (winning a battle always=1 point but the secret mission cards add additional goals for points.)

Fantasy Wargame: dice:varaible powers:modular board:secret missions

A nice little war game in a reasonable amount of time (for a war-game). A little exploration added in the mix along with a modular board and plenty of cards should keep this interesting for a bit. Light on strategy which is pretty straight forward and dictated by your cards but the game importantly doesn't forget to be fun. 

Lots of interaction as can be expected and it is encouraged by the system as it is the only way to get VP's, also "the king of the hill" bonuses to be had encourage fights too. A good dose of luck in the dice as usual but even more so in the missions which is where you get your points from, these come from a random draw at the end of your turn but at least you have several to choose from. I did like the balancing effect of losing wars which gave you cards amounting to certain "power ups" to help you along the way. 

I thought with 4 it ran just a tad long (easily fixed by changing VP total) and just a little downtime was there but no real AP (maybe I am too used to 2 player war games), 3 would be perfect and apparently 2 works as well. 

I don't see much comparison to A&A or Risk, besides being a war game that uses dice it is quite a  different game and stands on its own fine. A good and shorter ALTERNATIVE to those games? I would say yes this is a relevant statement.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Light, accesible, and fairly fun game.  With the right people I could see this being a bit deeper.  With people who aren't great tacticians this game is a little boring.  I find myself leaving units in exposed positions just to give my opponents something to do.  Maybe I need to stop trying to play games with the teenagers in the youth group.  They don't particularly seem to care and I am bored out of my mind most of the time...

I really would like to try this sometime with experienced players.

The opening exploratory rush is okay-to-good. The midgame is where NOps really shines: the back-and-forth on the monolith and over disputed hexes, the seemingly random attacks to fulfil secret missions, the cards, all great. My biggest complaint is that there /is/ no endgame. Someone can jump from six or eight points to the game-ending twelve with no sign that the game's about to be over.
Despite this I really enjoy it and would be happy to play a few times a year.

I call this 'Titan Light'.  Fun and balanced, this game does not waste three days of your life playing out one game.  really like the game pieces, but hate the paper-thin cardstock used for the player aids and the monolith. Moved this up to a '9' after playing it a few more times :)

Nice bits. Fun to build, amass and battle. Fluid game that encourages battling and not stagnation. I'm not a big dice fan, but this is light and short enough where I can bite my tongue. We played our second game (ever) in 15 minutes!

Mission cards are quite unbalanced, though. Momentum is nearly impossible to stop. Really, almost a "filler" game.

EDIT: Lowering this due to downtime and card luck. Another one of those games that you better play it with the right people. I probably won't play again even though it's kind of neat.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Exceptional in achieving what it sets out to do - exploration, economic building, and combat - all in 45 minutes or less.  Not the most meaty experience I'll ever have, but it'll get more plays than many other light wargames in my collection, simply because it WILL get on and off the table quickly, and still be an enjoyable experience.

Addendum - the missus hates it.  "Too much like Heroscape".  

Addendum Two - just when I started to think I was kicking butt too easily against new players, I got my ass handed to me by a nine year-old playing the "Rubium Dragons" strategy.  (Lots of double sixes for his humans, and a ton of ones and twos . . . but still.)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.1
This is such a pretty game. The little bits are so cool. The game plays nicely too--the mechanisms for recovery are well done. It has enough subtlety for le gameur, while also rewarding those of us that like to roll dice and punch space spiders in the face. Moving up! The kids love it. Every game is different.

A reasonably quick bash-em game. Not much subtilty involved. It looks like the starting player starts with too little cash. I think 10 would be better than the 8 the rules allow, but I've only played once. After playing several times, I think the 2 player game works well with 8 for the starting player and 11 for the other player, but the 8 is still to low when playing with 3 or 4 players.
We played a 4 player game and started the first player out with 10 bucks and the game seemed better for it.

I tend to play Risk and Risk clones very conservatively, and it usually serves me well.  That strategy does not work with Nexus Ops since the end of game is determined by points rather than last-man-standing.

RATING: 8
Fun game, I really like it for a 3-player option as the board is perfectly designed for three.  First time I played I thought that the rubium difference between the players was too harsh, but the ability to explore first is huge.    I really like how the secret mission cards help drive a different strategy each time you play.  

Last night I held the monolith with a strider and a Leaping Larry.  One opponent came in with two Dragons.  He played Frenzy to do two attacks.  He rolled a 1,1,1,3 :) so all I lost was the Strider.  I had almost a 50% change for Larry to take down the two dragons but what did I roll?  Snake Eyes - youch!  The monolith ended up contested but I won on my next turn anyway :)

Relatively simple area control game as you fight for control of resources on a planet using some of the natives to fight for you as well as your own forces.

Once you get into the swing of the game it plays very quickly and even though there's dice rolls in the combat there's a good amount of options and things you can do to attempt to mitigate those rolls and change things up.

You get points for winning battles, completing secret objectives, and controlling the center tile of the map. For the first game I recommend using the shorter game option where you play until 10 points rather than 12 as it goes a bit faster and doesn't wind down as much.

This comment is for the Avalon Hill edition.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (November 2013)

Good game, it is reminiscent of Risk, pure Amerithrash with lots of luck and many “take that” moments. I enjoy the game but lately I enjoy less and less the games in which you have to attack the leader.

The game components are superb, the miniatures look gorgeous on the board and they are very detailed. I want to have the game just for the components. I also like the unit variety (powers, cost, etc.), it  makes for some fun choices. The game takes around 2 hours to finish, which is very quick for this kind of game.

It has lots of luck, controllable in the form of dice, uncontrollable in the form of cards (secret objectives and recharge cards), so this is mostly a chaos game. I would like the secret missions to be less random but I don´t know how to fix this. I like that you score multiple VPs in a single turn so no one is really sure who is winning, making harder to “attack the leader”. Love the SciFi theme.

Bottom line, Nexus Ops is a good game I will play from time to time. For me, this fires Axis and Allies and most risk variants out there. I think this would be a 7.0 for me if played in teams rather than free for all, still it has the potential to go up in my ratings. I would never play it with 3 players, too unbalanced.

Current Rating: 6.0

Space battalion light. My troops (of various races and powers) vs your troops (of the same races and powers) explore a region starting from opposite sides, looking for mineral resources (which become cash to buy more troops). Victory through combat only.

I tried to hand a Dragon to my wife and she went "eewwwwww... stop bugging me". And she wasn't talking about the New Nexus Ops smell, which I gather is a universal experience.

Still she kindly consented to a game. And brought tongs because she didn't want to handle the pieces! (I banned the metal tongs. She was mostly ok handling the bits by the end of the game.)

All that aside, this game seems [i]fun[/i]. Not just that the mission cards and simple combat system seem chaotic and light hearted, but ...

"My dragon is moving in to attack your dragons, and bringing 4 hit points with him. (ie 4 humans.)"

"Come, my Crstaline brothers, for glory and death and a bonus in our paycheck let's swarm the enemy!"

"Look, Thog, you stay here and pin down these two dragons while we retreat to get help."

"Suck plutonium death, alien scum!"
"Hey, we're the same [i]species[/i]!"
"Ah, sorry... Suck plutonium death, corporate weasels!"

I won that first game, but my wife finished the game occupying most of the board! "Ok men, we may have had the living bettlejuice beaten out of us, we may have lost three quarters of our forces, but we... flew in a suicidal dragon to their home base, managed to kill one of their dragons in combat, had a human survive a battle (gosh!), and when we used to have Rock Striders on our side they managed to kill a crystaline for us. We sure showed them!"

:devil:

The miniatures are pretty good, though more mini than I was expecting, but the rest of the production has a few quicky poor quality aspects.

Not only is this a very fun kill-fest, but it taught me why I don't like most other combat-oriented games.  In Nexus Ops, you can be aggressive without consequences, without having to worry that you'll be eliminated or reduced to nearly no resources.  If that happens, another player's probably about to win anyway.  Turns out I like the aggression, I just don't like having to worry about losing territory I've built up.  Here there's just aggression, and waves and waves of troops.  Everything to gain, nothing to lose.  

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This game is good but it doesn't draw me quite like some others. As a wargame it is sufficiently complicated without being excessively confusing. The intelligent strategist does well to remember that it's about VP and not about total annihilation. I'll play it anytime I'm asked to but I don't usually grab it first off of the shelf.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
good one. Fun and light. Does its job very well.

Honestly, this is just a dang lot of fun. I'm so very glad I got it and when I want a very good light battle game, it's the one I go for.

Quick set up, quick rules, encourages battling (imagine that in a war game). Silly colored plastic pieces that look fantastic, terrain, a friggen' battle tower...energy and dice. Better than axis and allies for me at this stage and I loved Axis and Allies, but this is a great fast free for all. 

It makes me smile and now I want to play.

Played a 4 player game (first play ever) and after not applying the "can't move onto Monolith" properly at first and maybe not applying the Fungus/Crystal bonus/penalty all the time, I still say it's a good game. It's like Axis & Allies, sped up.  Although the ending conditions of VPs does feel a little unfullfilling, it all really works.  I recommend it to those who like a bit of dice tossing but still tactical decisions.

RATING: 7
Played once with a shaky grasp of the rules. Could be moderately fun. Rating is probably between 5 and 7, with very low odds of an 8. 

Update (2 years later): I think the game might need the multiplayer aspect so that a steamroller is checked by two fronts, but there's no doubt it's a well-designed dice-hex game. Actually, it's probably the best light game of that type this side of the C&C system. Easy to give it a hopeful 7. An 8 is not inconceivable with further play.

Played it twice now. It has some interesting idea's and it seems like it has more potential then it showed, it just wasn't great.
But for an area control game it is much better than a game of Risk.

Only played this two-player so far and if you don't mind confrontation, it's a great game for two.  It has confrontation without elimination, so it scratches an unique itch (I describe it as a cross between the point gathering of Settlers with the battling of Risk, for newbies).  And really, once you get over the buying units math, it's a great game that looks to scale well between 2 to 4 players (hopefully I'll get to play it with more).

There is a great balancing nature to the game, and the way it encourages confrontation as a victory condition without being overly punishing to anyone is simply fantastic (no elimination because victory is based on a point total).

So much fun that even though I've been skunked in each play, I still want to play again.  Shameful that this hasn't been played more.

Some have called this "Twilight Imperium Lite" & I would agree with this to small degree.  It IS a faster game--finishing sessions in less than 2 hours.  Some hate it, others love it.  I can get ANY of my gaming friends to play it & it is different every time we play.  Too bad it didn't get an expansion because it could use one.

Nexus Ops is a Euro-y Ameritrash game, a full-on battle-it-out dicefest that isn't fully random and doesn't take most of a day to play. Sitting in that under-served niche gets it more credit than it deserves, in my opinion. It's a clever system, but not a particularly engaging or replayable one.

Boy this one is called the best Ameritrash game for a reason. It has it all! I like the way that the cards you draw at the end of your hand dictate your strategy. They also just feel plain old cool. I had one that had me winning a battle in my opponent's base. It was so much fun to achieve. The rest of the game was equally satisfying.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This game started off as a 9 for me and my gaming group but has slipped to a 6 and will probably stop at a 5.  No-one buys Dragons anymore as they're too expensive, fragile and need support or they won't survive long.  As a group we want to battle each other rather than play to missions.  The missions themselves are unimaginative - eg score 2 pts for destroying a rock strider in battle, but why?  The game also takes overly long to play to completion.  We often abandon gameplay after 2 hours and agree on a winner.  All units are the same for all sides and strategy is the same most games.  This game badly needs expansions to give it legs.  It could be a really great game.  Apparently Avalon Hill doesn't believe in expansions - they're idiots.  Their games are suffering because of it.  Especially this one.  Look at how well Descent, Battlelore, M44, to name a few, are doing because of expansions.  We aren't really playing this anymore, it's a pity.  Will probably sell on Ebay and buy an expansion for Battlelore.
UPDATE - just changed it to a 5 since writing the comments.

Awesome awesome game. The little plastic models are what do it for me. The feeling of moving all of them to one hex when they didn't expect the dragon and spiders on the monolith to move. It gives a shorter, more balanced version of Risk with a more engaging battle system. I always felt like you could never win unless you occupy the monolith, but now I've seen several games won without it.

I got the 2012 FFG Version.  It's a really nice King of the Hill, Dudes on a Map game.  I enjoy it a great deal, it plays well as a 2,3, or 4 player game.

It's very easy to explain and I like it's quick set up and tear down.  A damned fine "light" skirmish/conflict/wargame thingamie (I don't know how you'd categorize it).  Fun AT game either way.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I enjoyed this more than I thought I would. It's a fairly chaotic dicefest, but with some neat income and unit-building mechanics, and a nice little combat system. The random, incremental victory point system works really well, and keeps the game moving quicky and towards a finish. This is light; luck is more important than strategy and tactics, but the short time investment and heavy chrome factor more than make up for any bouts of bad luck. In the right situation and mood this can be the perfect game to play.

2nd hand copy, looks good and is good. Not too long but good fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
Number of players: 2-4

Components: (10)
I own the Fantasy Flight Games version and it comes with FFG standard componets. What does that mean? It means quaility! The cards are excellent, the artwork is beautiful, and the minis are on par with everything else. I understand that the AH version wasn't poor quality, either. The monolith was raised and the figures would glow under a blacklight.
  
Rules: (10)
I wonder if Fantasy Flight Games used the rules as written in the orignal print run, or if they came up with their own? The reason I wonder is because this rule book is well written. I LOVE Fantasy Flight Games. I think they produce and reproduce some of the best games in the entire industry. However, I also feel as if they go out of their way to have the most poorly written rule books. For the most part, it'd be easier for me to get a euro with rules written in German than to try to figure out what's being written in a FFG rule book. Anyway, this game doesn't suffer that way. The rules are great. 

Setup: (9)
There are a lot of pieces to sort out, but they all make sense. You'll need to build the board, also, but I think it consist of only a few pieces. Put some chits on the board and you're pretty much ready to go.

Area required to play: (8)
I've ever only played this game 2 player, and it took up a little room. I guess it'd take up a little more with 3 or 4 players, but really not too much. You'll need an area in front of you to display cards and hold troops and Rubium (money/energy), but most things are confined to the board.
 
Fun: (10)
This is one of the most fun games I have ever played. You command your troops around the board to gain control of resource hotspots and knock the shit out of any one that comes within knockingtheshitoutof range.

Theme Integration / Mechanics: (10)
I understand why your human can kill my Rubium Dragon. I understand why your human will not kill my Rubium Dragon.

Replay Value: (10)
This game would be replayable even without the secret mission cards, but with them? I could play this game everyday and I do not think that I'd ever bore of it.

Storage: (8)
This is one of the first games that I ever seperated from it's insert. It didn't take long to see that I couldn't fit everything back in the box in a logical way with that insert in the way. So I trashed it and bagged everything up. It looks a mess when the box is opened, but everything is organized well enough.

Accessibility: (10)
I think that this is a game that would be easy to teach. The theme and the miniatures will draw people in who may be hesitant to play games otherwise.

Over-All/Bonuses/Biases: (+10)
This is one of Jessica's favorites, and one of mine too. It's a lot of fun, it's very replayable, and it has enough of that "screw you!" feeling to really make us love it.

RATING: 7
Nexus Ops plays like a real time strategy game like Starcraft, if that game were a turn-based tabletop game. The gameplay feels tight, and while there is some obvious luck-of-the-dice combat involved, it is not overbearing. Nexus Ops rewards aggressive play, clever tactics and an smart resource management.   
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
First: I don't care for direct confrontation. But when learning the game, there were some minor inconsistencies that we got caught up in. I don't like the "King of the Hill" mechanic. I don't like how much fate the dice have on the strategy. I find that probability has too much influence for my tastes in this game.

Thematically, it isn't appealing to me either. Giant alien bugs and space marines stopped appealing to me years ago. It's a theme that can be done well and I'd like it, but the theme in this game is too "whatever, this sounds cool".

Not bad for what it is - if you get lucky and pull the right mission cards, you'll do well.  If you roll well, you stand a better chance of winning.  It's an enjoyable game, but for me the theme is not particularly attractive nor is the gameplay very involving.  But it moves quickly - if you could play it in 45 minutes I'd be fine with it.  I don't really have any experience with dice-rolling combat games (never played Risk or Axis & Allies), so this should fit that niche just fine whenever I'm feeling in the mood.

Got a few plays in... Great game! Enough diversity between units, to make for real choices about what to buy. I love the way the game gets the action going very fast! No skulking around in the corners, amassing troops and resources. 
A distant relative of games like RISK, but this one won´t bore you to death at family reunions! (More likely it will get drunk, pick a fight, get laid and brag about it, before passing out during dessert! At the very latest!)

This game was very meh for me.  I enjoyed exploring the tiles and finding getting free units but then the game breaks down significantly.  A 2 player game was decided quickly after a single battle gave one player a significant strength advantage.  A 4 player game turns into a stalemate while everyone builds up their outer spaces in defense.  The fight for the center can be interesting but the person who holds it has a distinct advantage with the card draws.  Repeat games felt very samey.  This was an easy decision to trade away.

RATING: 9
This game is just immensely fun. The different mine breakout each time is what makes replay untedious, but there are also a couple of different strategies available - you can move forward in a rush and challenge your opponent(s) early, or you can hang back a little and be the one to slip in once they've beat each other up some. The game's luminescent bits are also exceptionally fun to play with. 

Let's face it, this game could use a variable player power or two, which is why I'm not giving it a 10 - it has theme to spare, but doesn't put it to as good use as I'd like. But that's such a minor quibble for a game that plays like Risk did when you were 12, only maybe even more interesting, and is just as good with 4 or 3 as with 2.

I really like the mix of tactical combat with euro-style VP mechanics.  A tight, elegant design that is a lot of fun to play.  Deploying the different troop types and the subtle but present terrain effects reminds of Advance Wars (a very good thing!).  More recently though, I've been finding Eclipse scratching the same itch but with a lot more depth.

2015-12-27 - 8 - You just deploy your troops and fight rolling dice with a lot of fun. That's the game I expected Kemet would be. Cool thing that with a small amount of luck or good cards (or both) even those little humans can beat the crap out of the dragon.

Rated after six plays. Played with 2, 3 & 4 players.
Very good system, easy to learn and play. Well balanced. The board is made of hexes which makes every game different as well as the secret mission cards and the energy card decks are a good size, so you will get different cards with different plays. Allows 2-4 players which is also a plus. Just a good, quick, light conquest game that can be played in about an hour.

Space! Combat! Aliens! A fun area control game with a great theme and just enough luck to keep things interesting.

My wife actually liked this game.  That was weird.  This is a good one that I think plays best with 3 players.  I think the board even looks a bit wonky set up for 4.  With 2, it takes too long to reach each other.  With three, it's perfect full conflict for everyone and no one to peacefully wave at across the monolith.

*Update*  I'm interested in the team play variant for 4 players.

I love this one...my Risk replacement! Sure, there's combat dice, but I find it more balanced and cosidered.

Perhaps it verges a little on the lengthy side, but that's easy to mitigate with reduced VP victory.

This is a really good, simple war game akin to Risk but with far fewer problems. There is an element of exploration and resource management, but in general it comes down to deciding which battles to fight in order to get the victory points necessary to win. The board (a series of hexagonal tiles you assemble) and bits (especially the colorful little plastic unit figures) are very attractive and easy to differentiate. Game play is simple and fast-paced, with a payoff that is appropriate for the game length and overall investment.  Well-designed game that is a lot of fun to play.

Traded Magdar and Wreckage for this ‘07.
Sold on ebay Jan '08.

Quick and to the point. A game where you can maximize your strategy because of the different terrain types and unit types.  There is never a safe spot on the board, that is for sure in this game, and that can prove disastrous for an unaware player. Only downside in my book is that the game is governed by victory point cards and not domination.

There's a lot of micro strategy in this, where little things can make the difference. But, then again, the game play is very driven by objective cards, which hurts the essence of the game and theme I think, hence the 7s.

Risk, gone mad.  I love how "different" this game is.  Thinking points over victories, & defense.  Battles that carry over into multiple rounds.  The differences in the playing pieces. etc. (the lists can go on and on.)

Terribly underrated and likely unknown for a while due to the lackluster AH releases by Hasbro prior to this game's release, but totally worth the original price tag. Tactical dice rolling fun that plays in about an hour with awesome pieces that you have to play just once in life under blacklight.

Faintly A&A; its main virtue is that it actually does play in 90 min.  VP-driven, which leads to my main complaint: looking at the board tells you very little about who's actually winning.  Petty of me, but still.

Great war game.  A lot like risk but with added strategy and objectives to complete.  Gathering victory points rather than having to wipe everyone off the board.

RATING: 6
Some people call Nexus Ops "Risk on steroids", being both games where you gather troops and where dice is the primary mechanism. While this is partially true, it would be more correct to say that its "A refined and polished version of Risk on steroids", as it picks what makes Risk attractive but puts in inside a much more nice package.

Basic rules are simple: each turn you produce units, move them around the board, battle your opponents, earn credits for the mines you control and then draw objective cards. Combat is balanced despite the dice element, as the random element they introduced can be compensated and controlled by effectively combining the different units. 

The game is objective-based, which makes each combat count: you cannot simply throw your troops at the grinder, but rather have to prepare your strikes to score as much objectives as possible. While you cannot score all objectives in one single attack, there is no limit of objectives per turn, so its common for players to score more than half of the victory points required for victory in a single turn. Being completely random, objectives are also what deprive the game of depth: certain objective combinations can be either very easy or very hard to achieve. Also, as you keep drawing them throughout the whole game, you can't plan ahead right from the start.

The components are excellent, even if I didn't liked them at first sight, particularly due to the strong plastic smell. Thankfully, it wears of significantly.

Nexus Ops is definitely a step up from Risk, not just a beefed up version. It's a pity objectives are so random.

RATING: 6
While the gameplay is very deep and strategic, the super balanced gameplay makes it... kinda boring.  What the game has in amazing component quality, well balanced power and overall great balanced game design, it lacks oomph. 

i think if powers were a bit more asymmetrical the game would have benefit a lot, or perhaps even from an expansion.  It sounds like a lot of bad, but the game is solid.  It's a legitimate contest of skill, thought and tactics.  It just lacks the excitement of battle that a game like this should have 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Fast-paced and fun. Not a mind-bender by any means, but enough tactics to be interesting and make it feel like you won (or lost) based on your own choices as well as the dice.
A nice twist on most Risk-type games because you win by getting victory points rather than strictly by defeating armies.
I have a friend who always loses because he spends too much time building up an army and not enough time winning small skirmishes to get him a key VP or two.
I, on the other hand, always look like i'm about to lose because i'm sacrificing so many guys, but then Lo! it turns out I gave them up for good reason, because now I have all the victory points I need to win. Muah!

This game charmed  me. I  like very much the computer game Starcraft and Nexus Ops very to me reminds him with the climate. The game is quick, the fight is well-founded (the order is the order) and the thoughtless fight does not give large effects. Well planned actions are the key to the victory in this game. Additionally beautiful figurines of units (6 kinds in 4 colours), the class.

RATING: 6
Only a couple of plays so far, but I think I like this better than Memoir '44 for this category of game.  Even simpler rules, slightly more strategic gameplay (you have to build the units you think you're going to need several turns before you need them, and holding the territory which earns you money for building units is usually at odds with stomping the enemy, which earns you points), and it supports up to 4 players.

Update: hmmm, none of the adults I've tried this with have been quite as interested in it as the burrito boy.

2009-10-31: played this again recently with my group (3-player), and they liked it a lot more this time.

2012-07-12: dropping this to a 6, as it's never really my first pick.  Probably should drop it lower.

Not in the genre I like, but I have to give some credit to Nexus Ops, because it is simplier than it looks and that's why it is fast enough to play even if you are newbie. But I hate these small miniatyres when they aren't different enough AND I hate when publisher uses text when you should use simple symbols. Now you need read the text to understand/remember when you get some +/- for your rolls. Some other usability issues as well and here we are: 5 is my final rating.

Nexus Ops is a light-medium science fiction war game. The game boasts a hexagonal board that is set up differently every time, as well as (in the Avalon Hill edition) cool "glow" miniatures and lots of combat. Players control competing futuristic corporations that battle each other for control of the moon's Rubium Ore. By winning battles and fulfilling Secret Missions, you can obtain victory points.

I would love a new deluxe variant with a better and more sturdy central piece.

"Interstellar Corporations Wage War On a Distant Moon"

Best. Theme. Ever.

This game is just fun. It's light, yet still manages to give you interesting tactical decisions as wel as let you dabble in a little bit of resource management. The game favors attacking so the game rarely bogs down.

The game is pretty good with 2, really fun with 3, and i've yet to play with 4 which I imagine is where the real fun begins.

RATING: 8
A tightly-focused gem that anyone can come from behind to win, a refreshing change that sets this one apart from other conquest games. The secret missions also make this a great gateway game for kids; the missions provide concrete mini-objectives as well as a real opportunity to thrash their elders. With plasma breath, no less. Nexus Ops scales pretty well with fewer than the max number of players. However, it does play differently with 2 players versus 3 or 4 (more like your typical "conquer the world" game, although the Secret Mission cards go a long way to rectify this), and the game can be unbalanced if the mines are distributed too unevenly. The addition of more players opens up the possibility for diplomacy (admittedly of the thuggish gangland variety, very much in keeping with the "amoral corporate mercenary" theme) and therefore more avenues for victory.

RATING: 5
There are many good points to this game: easy to learn, modular board, objectives cards, point based victory. The problem is that it's just a boring war game. I played a 3 player game. What generally happens is that each player has their territory and nobody necessarily insist on invading other people territory because they don't need to. They just need to fulfill victory cards. So what happen is that you have these little skirmishes at the border of your territory and that's it you end up losing or winning. 

Sure, it allows the game to end, but it removes the basic concept of war which is, you fight for some ressources or something. I thought during the game that my opponent would have taken his troops from the monolith up to my home base. But, there is no way he could screw me up because losing my base does not make me lose anything, I can still produce in my base hex if it is invaded. So why bother invading your opponent, just fullfill border skirmish and gain victory points.

Finally, the monolith is really too much powerfull. It gives you special cards which makes sure you keep superiority to stay in control the monolith.

+ Simple enough rules (some complications about when cards can be played, though).
+ Nice game material (2nd edition). Nice miniatures. Clear player aids.
+ I liked strategizing about which zones to attack, which units to target, where to defend, etc. (but only for half the game [see below]).
- Hard to keep in mind all the secret objectives. 
- High variance in combats (single die per unit, and then if you lose in a combat with just a few units, the risk to have a strong unit be defeated)
-  Board situation which is not so fluid (at least with 2 players), and objectives that are variations on a theme (kill unit X, have a majority of Y,…): during the second half of my first game, I was realizing that I had to grind through the rest of the game doing the same thing over and over (because the goals do not have much flavor, so they look samey).

Great light wargame. I had issues with the A&A system at first, my experiences of really long and not-so-good games of A&A made me a little bit skeptic. The game is awesome, the balance in it is almost magic, the only thing that really does unbalance the game is if someone gets 2-3 "2" mines in the first turns. After a few turns the decisions are still simple and not really long-termed, what keeps it really light. The "objective system" keeps the game moving, you have lots of opportunities to win, even if you're not a "leader" (wich I realize is really rare, you have so much going on that is really difficult to keep hold on your territories, even if your opponents are not playing "right"). Great game, I'm really thinking of getting a second copy to play it with 8 people or play a super-large game...

My friends keep asking for it, it has become almost a staple in all our game nights, whenever we have 4 players we want to play it.

This is a solid board game, but there appear to be some balance issues: Turn Order seems to play a huge role in gaining an advantage. Some mission cards appear to be unbalanced - Players can win just based on the mission cards they drew and not the strategies they employed during play. Still, the game is entertaining. I would recommend giving it a try to see if it's for you.

From what I wrote in a forum post:
"Played Nexus Ops for the first time this weekend. Two players, we were both new to the game. We enjoyed it so much we played a second game immediately after and probably would have played a third if time permitted. Good, clean, guy fun, that seems to reward thoughtful play. The rule that only lets you score victory points when on the offensive keeps this game from bogging down."

I've played several more times and the game has held up well. Universally liked by those I've played it with.

Although we hadn't had much luck with wargames, I picked up [GAMEID=15363] when I saw it on sale since it had been discontinued.  I'm a closet sci-fi geek, so this was right up my alley.  The glow in the dark pieces looked cool, and the game looked like a fun dice fest.  I'm sure I would have loved this game as a kid as a replacement for [GAMEID=181].

My girlfriend was skeptical, but we gave it a few shots.  Surprisingly, she thought it was decent, and more interesting than [GAMEID=10630].  I think part of the reason is that there is a small economic component to the game rather than just hurling armies and dice at each other.  There are hidden tiles that you have to explore.  There are strategic mines where you harvest resources to upgrade your armies.  There are strategic positions like the central Monolith that you fight for.  There are also secret missions that you try to accomplish for bonuses.  And if you lose a battle, you get a bonus Energize power card that helps you out by giving you special abilities.  Moreover, taking a page out of many Euro games, you don't necessarily have to obliterate your enemy to win the game---you just have to collect enough Victory Points through other goals.

However, the two player game didn't work as well for us, as we observed a strong runaway leader problem.  Once you fall behind in resources or lose control of the Monolith, it becomes difficult to claw your way back.  The Energize cards try to provide a balancing mechanism to the losing player, but the one of the big issues we've found is that whoever controls the central Monolith (and it's usually the winning player) gets two Energize cards as well, so no real balancing actually occurs.  With more players, this effect would be less pronounced due to shifting player alliances and ganging up on the leader. 

Although I found [GAMEID=15363] fun and interesting, this game is probably much better with more people than with just two.  Unfortunately, we have yet to break it out with more players, but I'm looking forward to that day.

The rest of my game group likes this game more than I do.  I find the combat and creature options to be a bit to shallow for a combat style game.  The rest of the system is quite enjoyable.  I would have rather seen a cardboard tile of some sort for the central space that does not obsure my view of the rest of the board.  Colors are bright and vivid. I did not find that the 'story' really tied into the mechanics which is admittedly a minor gripe.

The only game I bought a BACK UP COPY of and am leaving on a shelf in shrink until my original set wears-out.  Tactical, strategic, tense with good players, it never fails to entertain me.

Do we really need another Risk/Axis & Allies knockoff?  That question prevented me from trying out this game for a year or two.  After playing it, however, I found the answer is "Yes we do!"  Well, at least when it's the best of the Risk/A&A-style games, we do.  It's also the game that Twilight Imperium 3 should have been--much simpler and more playable without losing any of the fun.  I have to hand it to the new Avalon Hill for coming up with an excellent new (if derivative) game, even if they have decided to discontinue production of it :(.  This has quickly become a new favorite game.  It has a modular board, randomly determined and secret victory conditions, and it's quite possible to win the game even when two players gang up on you, so it works well with 3 players.  This game accomplishes what many others have set out to do, but came up short.  Destined to be a classic.

  Game came in the mail, read the rules on the subway, and got a game started as soon as I got home.  Fulfills that violent, slightly ameritrash urge inside myself and plays out fairly quickly.

Picked up Nov 2006 - clearance at 401 Games
Seems that somewhere along the line I picked up a second copy but I forget where

I guess I am going to have to buy this since it is being phased out by Hasbro and is now on sale at lots of places.

First play Dec 30, 1011
My 6 year old can play with open hands and a bit of help. But 12 points is too long for his attention span.

It seems pretty tense with a lot of back and forth. I think this would be a great head to head or team game.

This doesn't come out too often, but I am glad to have the older edition. Picked up a 3D printed Monolith even from Shapeways - May 2016.

If you like simple (fantasy) wargames, this is one of the best you can find. It has a fast pace and a very acceptable overall lenght, but also the usual (for the genre) randomness (dice rolling to resolve combat, objective cards) and direct screwage.

I bought the Avalon Hills version a while back as a sort of impulse buy, and I was pleasantly surprised. The quality of the miniatures was very nice, and the game itself is a lot of fun, even with just two players. The mission cards add a little bit of variety to your strategy as well, so it's not just a "save up and buy the best units" kind of game. I'm looking into purchasing the FFG version as well, just because I liked the original so much. I'd definitely recommend to anyone looking for a fairly light-weight strategy game.

Got this game as my Secret Santa gift a few years ago. The game is fast, simple and fun. The components are so nice too. I don't like Risk (which this has been compared too) but I like this game. The mechanics (exploration, resource management and combat) all work very well together and the focus on secret missions makes the game last not too much.

RATING: 5
A somewhat fun risk-style battle game, with a neat victory point system.  A 2nd playing of this has caused me to drop my rating.  It just seemed to take too long and have too much down time for 4 players.  The exploration element is fun, but only lasts for 2-3 turns.  I kind of wish there were some community missions that all players could attempt - to create more tension.

Nexus Ops is certainly a huge improvement over Risk while being extremely easy to teach for non-gamers. I feel that for the time you put into the game (over an hour) could’ve been used to play other games that are more involved with less random elements.  Simply put, Nexus Ops feels dated, and there isn’t much replay value or strategy

Since I've gotten this game it really has grown on me. A step up from Risk some say but to that I don't have a comment. This game is one of my favorites with its unique combat order, unit abilities, energize cards, and secret missions all bundled into one amazing package. Avalon Hill has made some blunders on their games but this surely wasn't one of them. That is, until they put it Out of Print.

Not much to this game and the Secret Mission cards make this more random than I'd like (though it does help with the possible problem of just piling on one person), but it's a nice and simple dice-rolling good time and it plays pretty quickly. I'd play it again.

Pretty fun light game with suprisingly good components from hasbro. Feels a lot like a lighter and much faster playing version of Twilight Imperium (and a lot more balanced to boot). Definately extremely random due to the secret objectives though. The cards gained from losing battles and being on the monolith are pretty clever yet simple ways to prevent turtleing and players getting picked on.

Ive only played with two but id say its definately better with 3 or 4.

4 / 5 - Great.

Can't see how you could want much more from a light conflict game - who cares if it's a tad unoriginal when it beats the opposition in this category into the dust? Fast, fun and with a surprising amount of difficult tactical choices thanks to the card-based VP system. Scales fairly well too. It is a bit on the lightweight side though, and starts to feel samey after repeated plays. See my review for more details: http://fortressat.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=485

Imagine a game like Risk, but shorter, cleverer, more aggressive and with cool secret missions to accomplish. And alien freak monsters to command. This game is incredibly well-balanced and gives you an injection of satisfying Dudes On A Map fun in a small space and short time. That said, the board looks like technicolor vomit.

FUN: A quick and brutal wargame where attacking is the only way to win. It feels incredibly balanced, despite the dice based combat. 

UNIQUE: I had never seen this single-round initiative based combat before.

NEGATIVES: There is definite luck in the dice-rolls, the energize cards and the secret mission cards. If the corporations had a special ability and/or unique units, this would be the ultimate translation of a RTS computergame to a boardgame.

A very simple game with tons of combat with other players. Miniatures are quite well-made and are fun to play with. Combat is extremely simple - just roll a dice.

Quite a few customizations and scenarios. Recommended for casual play, very easy combat game.

Based on only 2 plays both with 4 players. Great, quick little game for a little filler before or after a long game. Simple mechanics make learning this one easy (I explaned the game to our group having never seen the rules before and we still finished in just over an hour). Random setup and victory cards make every game different. This game rewards aggresive players (who win battles)as they will gain more opportunity for victory points. There is enough luck that any one can win but there is still the ability to play smart and effect the odds.

Similar mechanics of Axis $ Allies. Fix most problems with Axis & Allies. Play time is not an issue anymore, there is no player elimination(never seen any). Trying to fulfill your missions makes the game different every time. 
The is is not as good as in A&A and you pretty much loose your long term strategy. Still, I don't really like a game that you make long term strategy and the combat is resolved with dices. 
Still a wargame at heart. One of the only one that I will keep in my collection.

Quintessential skirmish game, stripped to the bone, leaving behind everything that doesn't serve confrontation. It's the essence of explore, expand, exploit and exterminate, just couldn't be more streamlined than this. The balance of the units and the board layout is awesome, plays equally well with any number of players from two to four. The secret objectives and action cards makes it endlessly replayable.

A Sci-fi "war" game with action space battles and what I personally would call "Panzer Spiders?" Yes, please. It fills a particularly important niche in that it is:

-Low time commitment and rules overhead
-Scalable number of players
-High replayability
-Is not kick the leader or squash the weakling
-Combat driven (big bonus to my interest)

I could play this with my niece or with buddies over beers. NOW WITH 100% MORE SPACE BATTLES!!1!

RATING: 9
Game in a Nutshell: Compete on a modular board (planet) to gain victory points for completing battle oriented missions. Use the planets own creatures, each with they're own strengths to battle it out via stream-lined dice battles.

Played as: 2,3,4 player

Pros: It's just fun. Play this under a couple of black-lights and you have a gaming experience that is near impossible to top. Doesn't do too little or too much for what it is: The board is modular enough to add the right amount of variation from game to game while not being radically inconsistent, and a good variety of units with enough to distinguish themselves while not being overly complicated. The battles don't drag on like some other war-games, and it seems to work out that good decision making can give you a chance even when luck isn't on your side. Plus the game looks cool while you're playing it.

Con: A game like this, simple and fun, shouldn't take as much time as this usually does (~2 hours, though this may be because of the way we played it). Doesn't work with four people (free-for-all) as much as I'd like as the economy gets a little tight and I want more money for me... to buy more rubium dragons.

Other: I like to sell this game by telling people it's a combination of Risk and Settlers... in space. Played under a black-light, this game may approach a 10. Still wanting to try this game with teams. 

Best Use: When people feel like Risk, but in style and with a splash of Euro.

Hits the sweet spot for light-beer-fun-I-slaughter-you game, while still having enough of strategical things to ponder about. Best played if people just attack, attack, attack - and then, when nobody expects it, make some strange move that gives you a shipload of points to set you up for the win a turn later......fun stuff.
Steer clear if you hate dice though, or if comments like "my dragons just toasted your pitiful humanoids" bother you in any way.

It is somewhat a pity that one burns out a bit on this game after a while because the mission cards get old and the unit types are always the same. It is even more a pity that Avalon Hill has already ditched this game which means that an expansion with some new missions, unit types, and terrain ideas, being more than welcome and actually adding something, is completely out of the question.

A very good and wonderfully thematic light wargame that satisfies in many ways. It's got just enough of everything (cool minis, variety of units, 2-, 3- and 4-player suitability, cruel card plays, short game play, simple but not simplistic rules, science fiction goodness) to please science fiction geeks, light wargame fans and AT devotees.

Well done! I'd like to see more games of this type. I especially like the fact that, although it has the look of a game that works best with four, it plays great with two and three. A very versatile and entertaining game.

This is one of my favorite games, and it's one of the few that I consider a must-play at conventions (along with Arkham, Rommel in the Desert and Duel of Ages.)

I'm bumping this to a 9, because its quality is persistent, and I've never had a bad game of it. I'm not sure if I can say that of any other game I've played more than five times.

Well, revel in the momentous occasion, fellow geeks. Behold, the first game I have elevated to a 10 rating. All my other 10s--from my formative years. But no longer can I justify holding this back. There's just nothing at all to ding it for. Welcome to PerfectHappyGameLand, Mr. Ops.

The game is just fun! I love how the cards force interaction, and change the strategy from game to game. Our group laughed as we played this, and I bought it immediately for my monthly purchase!

Update: I bought two blacklights to make the pieces glow, and the results were stunning. My kids loved it. Too bad the board doesn't take advantage of the blacklight as much as the pieces do. Would be cool to have a Tron-like play-surface.

RATING: 8
Great quality components (with the exception of the monolith, which is poor). Simple, clear rules. Fast paced - plays in around an hour.

Good level of player interaction which is strongly encouraged by the game's scoring mechanism. Nice balance of luck and skill, and the Secret Mission cards are well done. Better than Risk in every way.

The included player aids for this game are the best I have seen for any game. The aid shows 80% of the game rules in a very easy to understood format.

Recommended. Comments based on 2-player experience only.

Well done. Action starts to steamroll quickly, and you're just pushing, damn the torpedoes fun. (There are no torpedoes.) The dice-rolling is not overly influential. But really, neither is the modular setup; there's not going to be as much variation from game to game as say Neuroshima Hex, and there are no differences in abilities between the armies - so it's not an especially rich experience, but it doesn't have to be.

RATING: 6
Good production values with cool looking "gummy bear"/dayglo, candy like plastic pieces.  You'll really appreciate the art direction in the AH edition once you've seen the FFG edition...

This is a light conflict game which prods players into taking the offensive... turtling too much will lead to defeat (definitely a good thing in this type of game!).  Not deeply strategic, but there are tactical options and the game plays swiftly.

Some of the Secret Mission cards are unbalanced in that some objectives  are much easier to fulfill than others.  This negative is somewhat offset by the game's shortish playing time and a player's ability to discard Secret Mission cards for rubium.
s
Lots of random elements, which adds to the enjoyment if you're a Risk/Ameritrash fan.  Games can be finished in under 90 minutes with experienced players.

As it stands, Nexus Ops is a game that I'm still willing to play but no longer feel like I need to own, and in some respects, the game has been superceded by games like Kemet, Forbidden Stars and Cyclades.  Going to miss those dayglo game pieces though.

--------------------------------------------------------

The number of unit pieces per player, number/type of hex tiles, card mix (Energizer, Secret Mission) and exploration tokens remain the same.

Other differences between the two editions not mentioned above:

Standard Rules:
In the FFG edition, you can discard anytime during your turn, as many Secret Mission or Energize cards as you like, for 1 rubium per discarded card. Discarded cards are placed face up on the discard pile.

Secret Mission Card:
Death from Above
AH: Move at least 2 Rubium Dragons from the Monolith to opponent's level-3 mine space and win a battle.
FFG: Win a battle in an enemy home space with at least 1 Rubium Dragon moved from the Monolith.

Energize Cards:
Radiation Cloud
AH: Destroy 2 Humans.
FFG: Destroy 2 Humans in the same hex.

Scattered Rubium
AH: Gain 1 rubium for each space you control outside your home base.
FFG: Collect 3 rubium OR Collect 2 rubium for each of your controlled hexes that does not contain a refinery.

Frenzy
Clarification.
AH: Each unit gets 2 attacks instead of 1 this battle. Play before battle begins.
FFG: During this battle, each unit in this hex (BOTH friendly and enemy) rolls two attack dice instead of only one. Apply both results. Play this card before a battle begins.

Six Optional Exploration Tokens
+7 Rubium (2)
+2 Energizer Cards (2)
+1 Energizer Card and a level-1 mine (2)

Use the new tokens with the proviso that the total value of all mines available in the exploration token mix is at least 16 rubium.

A really nice balanced light sci-fi wargame with Axis & Allies style battling. The random map and discovery tiles make each game different. Different strategies are required depending on your position in the turn order, because the first player starts with low resources but the best expansion possibilities, while the last player gets the most resources but worst expansion possibilities. Also, depending on whether your discovery tiles reveal extra forces or more income your strategy will need to be adapted.

RATING: 6
A miniature-based game wherein players buy units who can then go control board spaces and/or attack enemy units.  Points are earned by winning battles or accomplishing goals on secret "objective" cards.  

Unfortunately, players only draw 1 "objective" card per round.  This means that luck plays a huge part in who gets cards that are accomplishable (as some objectives require other players to have built certain units, etc.).  Additionally, units move very slowly, meaning that accomplishing objectives often takes multiple turns and responding to changing situations also takes multiple turns.  

The game ends immediately upon the first player reaching 12 points; this seems very sudden to me, and creates a race for that 12th point (even if it means leaving openings that other players could have exploited).  I'd rather have seen it end with a full round after one player hits 12 or some such (as people are often ramping up at the end).

This is a perfect game for those days when you’re feeling like playing Risk or Axis & Allies but don’t want to get into a full blown 3-6 hour commitment. A simpler version and small map ensures quick conflict with a very slight resource management. It comes with a lot of really well made pieces. Although, the “monolith” seems rather shoddy compared to what’s in the rest of the box.

After playing this, I will never play Risk again if I can help it.  This game has all the wanton slaughter goodness of Risk, with a greatly increased number of choices and strategy.  Variable unit powers, terrain-based bonuses and penalties and objective cards that promote suicide runs over simply building up forces for the final battle.  All playable in 1-2 hours.  Definitly takes several games to learn the flow and all the possibilities.

Cool bits, simple rules, first play was definitely fun. Diet, low-carb Starcraft, I'd say. I won't say no future games, and my son especially seemed to like it.

Second play was even more fun, as I started to understand the Secret Mission cards, and used them to plan an endgame push. Looking forward to introducing this one to the guys.

Subsequent plays confirm: there is quite a little game in here, and I love it more with each play.

A fantastic game that is easy to learn in which each player has a group of aliens and humans who work for rival corporations trying to control the primary resource of a planet.

Excellent game. Perfect for scratching the dudes on a map area control itch without investing 4+ hours, but despite the short(er) length, it still manages to retain a fair bit of depth. Also, the secret objectives cards add another layer to the basic area control game. They make the game more interesting, help with replay value, and also help to shorten the game by guiding (but not dictating) your strategy, so you don't have to deal with AP-prone players agonizing over when and where to attack. The pacing of the game is also very fast, so there's not a ton of downtime, and it remains interesting even on other players' turns, even when you're not involved in any battles.

Update: Dropped rating to a 6. After a few plays of this, it seems like the game tends to play out too quickly and predictably, and luck of the draw on the cards is a slightly bigger factor than I previously estimated. I think I initially liked the idea of being able to get a quick fix of a dice combat game, but as it turns out, I think I'd prefer to either commit to a full-length wargame, or just play something else. The thing that draws me to dudes on a map games in the first place is the plotting, scheming, and maneuvering, and the ebb and flow of battles won and lost. This game is just too short, and too small, to be able to provide much of that.

This is a good strategy/board-minis game for the risk lovers out there.  The game is run by buying units and running them out on the board to take over areas.  The nice thing about it is that the winning condition is to collect victory points through mission cards.  That means that even if you are losing bad battle/unit/area wise you still have a good shot at winning.  You are never out of the race, even if you are beat down bad.

Dunno why, but I quite like it and look forward to introducing it to different groups of friends.  Very easy to get newbies to play, while guaranteeing short-term, tactical-style fun.

UPDATE:  Down half a point.  While it's easy to teach, there are little bits of rules that are not where (I think) they should be, and are thus forgotten.  Also, the game tends to end with a whimper, especially when someone wins by 5-7 points in a turn.  A bit deflating.

LOVE THIS GAME!   Easy to teach and learn, fast playing, GREAT bits.

Victory can only come through constant combat so there's always something going on.  Very small, almost claustrophobic board ensures action every round and very very little down time.

Much better than I expected it to be. Avoids the 'slippery slope' common among elimination style conflict games. Plays quickly and leverages dice and card's randomness well to provide appreciable tension.

As owners of immortal galactic corporations it is your job to find new moons that will yield the valuable resource Rubium.

In Nexus Ops you have found just such a moon but so have the opposition. Now you must enslave various alien species in order to secure those riches for yourself.

Nexus Ops is one of the best conflict games on the market as it offers a variable board, equal balance for any number of players and some neat mechanics that encourage aggression (keeps the play time down) and variability (mission cards). 

A must for fans of the conflict genre.

Excellent light-weight wargame. Cool miniatures.  Lot of tension. There is unique victory points system. Someone don't like it, calling "cheating", cause a player can win the game even if he almost had been vanished. But I like that the aim of the game is not "kill'em all". There are only two flaws: some downtime and lack of illustration on cards.

A very basic dudes on a map game, but it's probably my favorite of the genre. Even though it doesn't relate at all, Nexus Ops gives me a very similar feel to playing Starcraft. You're acquiring resources, building up troops, and fighting over areas on the board with objective cards. Plays well at all numbers, and completely obliterates games like Risk.

UPDATE: As I've played other dudes on a map games, I always return to and wish I was playing Nexus Ops. Easily the best of the genre. 7->9

FURTHER UPDATE: 9->6. My recent forray into Risk Legacy has diminished my opinion of dudes on a map games that are too flashy. This game isn't even that flashy, but if I'm going to play a game in the genre, I kind of prefer some of the modern Risk variants in comparison. The resource management slows the flow of the game enough to be annoying. Plus Empires of the Void has a very similar combat mechanism. This one remains okay, but not something I'm chomping at the bit to play anymore.

Now that I've had a chance to play this, its alright.  It's hard to keep track of what your guys are, because there so small and some of the tiles become too crowded with guys.  The raduim goes quick (with 2 players) that we had too much raduim and ran out of guys.  Hard to keep track of what guys you've already moved as well.  Maybe I need to get it on the table, more, but for now, it's on the trading block.

RATING: 7.5
A very good tactical/strategic battle game. So far we've just played one game so my views and ratings on the game may of course go up or down with further play... but so far so good. Nexus Ops is a relatively simple and fast moving game. Like many games... it takes a few turns to get a feel for the game play and learn the rules about what can and can't be done. There are a few niggly bits in the rulebook but nothing that can't be cleared up by reading the discussions of BGG. The rules generally are straight forward and clearly written but could perhaps show a few more examples for some of the action cards which have the effect of altering the game play depending on where and when they are used. I think the designer/publisher wanted a very concise rulebook and they actually could have made it a couple pages longer and cleared up a few issues people are having.

That aside though.. the game works smoothly at delivering a fast paced battle experience where you are constantly thinking about how to increase your forces the most effectively and which forces should be moving in what direction to best take advantage of the various terrain effects. I can't help but compare this game to Heroscape in that terrain effects work much better here in Nexus Ops than in HS. The variety of characters in Heroscape is certainly more diverse but the simplicity and "efficiency" of Nexus Ops actually is a strength. The game feels well balanced and there isn't a tonne of unneeded chrome making the game more complex than it has to be. I would say it's almost a perfect combination of a luck "influenced" battle game crossed with the balancing sensibilities of a Euro Game. The balance they have achieved produces an interesting game that goes on for just long enough so you aren't getting tired of the mechanisms by the end of it all. The ability to raise or lower the VP victory conditions is another nice feature as you can make the game as long or as short as you choose.

My favorite things about Nexus Ops is how straightforward it is.  Put your dudes on a map, move them around the map, and hit other people's dudes.  Awesome.

Unfortunately, it's so straightforward that it's a little hard to get excited about playing.  When you've got a good group together and just want to bash each other, though, Nexus Ops is gold.

EDIT: Fired from my collection (mostly by Blood Rage).  Still a great game!

Wow.  It's a real shame that it took so long for me to get this to the table, as this is a really great little game.  It doesn't try to be more than just a pure combat game, but it does that so well it doesn't matter.  And more than any other confrontation game, it really encourages expansion and confrontation.  If you sit back and turtle up, you won't win.

As with other games like this, it can be quite lucky.  This is compounded by the random distribution of the mines and other resources.  It is possible, especially with three players, that there might be a "bald" spot in the board, where no player wants to fight because no mines exist there.  As a result, the players may end up ganging up on one player.  Still, the game is short and sweet, and any flaws in the gameplay are minor.  This is the perfect game to let out that aggression and get in some good conflict.

Gather resources to spend on one of 6 types of units (humans, fungoids, crystalline, rock striders, lava leapers, and dragons). Use units to occupy hexes to get more resorces. VPs awarded for winning battles and satisfying conditions on mission cards. Earn bonus cards by occupying a monolith in the center of the board or by losing a battle. Battles are decided by dice. There is a lot of luck, for instance, all the two value mines could show up on an opponent's side of the board, plus if someone goes first they could get to the monolith before you do and you may not be able to displace them. If you don't mind the luck, the figures are neat, and it plays quickly.

great little light war game.  Has everything you need to satisfy your war craving in less than 90 minutes game time:  Random board, exploration theme included, progressive units (weak->strong) with a tiered combat system, great tactical decision making needed with the inclusion of unit special abilities and the monolith/terrain.  Has a built in timer (Victory point conditions from cards in the form of Winning combats and completing random secret objectives).  Overall, just fantastic for what it is and the committment involved.  Essentially a TI light.  This would appeal to anyone who like Risk all the way to TI fans.

A decent enough game, but after a few plays I think the gameplay feels too counter intuitive to me. Or the strategies might be too abstracted from the theme for my taste. I keep wanting to protect my borders and supplies, when I should be consolidating my forces and squishing enemies before I get swamped. 

And while I know I'm just not good at it, it doesn't make me want to keep playing to learn how to get better either. The game looks gorgeous (and I am definitely going to use the great day-glow pieces in home brew games!) but what I'm actually doing on the board doesn't grab me unless I'm being intentionally silly, so I might as well let someone who is more interested play instead.

Not really my sort of game -- build up troops, then send them out to beat up the other players, which involves a lot of dice rolling.  I also felt that the monolith was overpowered -- gaining two energize cards for controlling it makes it much, much more powerful than any other space.  A single card might be more balanced.

Despite this it was a reasonably diverting game, requiring a degree of tactical thinking.

I bought a black light just for this (AH/Hasbro 1st Edition).  How could you not, really?

Also, custom 3D printed monolith to replace the junky one included in the AH version.

Edit: Finally played after owning for months.  Moves fast and encourages offense - board is surprisingly small and hectic for two players.  Imagine it's nuts with more...in a good way.  I like it but not sure I love it - bears more plays.

I felt the need to find a few (light) combat games to add some variety to my collection. Although I dislike dice combat, Nexus Ops has a few mechanics in place to aid players who seem to consistently roll poorly. This, and the fact that total annihilation isn't the goal of the game interested me. (The sci-fi theme didn't hurt either.)

The Avalon Hill version is unique, but not everyone's taste. The Fantasy Flight version is pretty, but generic.  Personally, I like the comicbook art and cartoon miniatures of the first edition best.

Unfortunately, despite being the best I've played of this particular style of game (Risk, Axis & Allies, etc.) I just don't feel like playing Nexus Ops, or any of these types of combat games. It really feels like I've grown out of them or at least moved away from the crowd of people that I would have enjoyed playing them with in high school. Sorry Nexus Ops. Its not you, its me.

A war strategy game that takes 45 minutes = awesome.  The different victory cards that players get in the beginning is the only difference between players.  Summon creatures and take control of different hexes occasionally encountering opposing players with a battle.  Battles are simple (dice?, i forget) and also help people score their victory card conditions.

The time and battle are what make this game an 8 to me, anxiously awaiting the re-print.

Fun little wargame, with an emphasis on maximizing skirmishes as a long-term strategy.  And fight you will, a lot, as it's the primary scoring mechanism.  I cocooned early on, which wasn't terribly effective.  Very random, which I usually like.  Another game would be good.

Funny -- everyone says it's the game that TI3 should have been, and I disagree violently.  There's no sense of individuality to the different players.  There's no scoring mechanism EXCEPT fighting.  There's not much call for diplomacy, because everyone is attacking anywhere they think they can win a victory and so it's hard to take things terribly personally.  No politics.  No epic feel.  I like it for what it is: a light skirmish game.  But it's no TI3.

The new version has pastel units (ugh) and a flat center hex with some really gaudy board art, however the figure sculpts are very nice and there is a lot of variants and alternate rules packed right in so that the amount of game in the box is amazing.  I need more plays but based on initial impression I think it will fill a unique niche in my collection.

RATING: 9
Nexus Ops is an objective game. It is not area control, it is not a wargame. You are given objective cards which give you certain conditions to meet in order to obtain victory points. There is no ebb and flow of point like in an area control game, there is little overarching combat strategy/tactics like in a wargame.

On your turn, you simply build your units and try and meet some of your objectives. These can be controlling certain areas, eliminating certain units, winning battles in certain areas or performing some action. The key point is that once completed, these points cannot be taken from you. There will be a steady rise until the point where someone wins. You may obtain cards that give your units benefits during the game. These generally deal with improving either your income, or helping your units in a battle.

The shortness of this game is what appeals to me. It is a good combat objective game, and since it can play in under an hour, it doesn’t feel dragged out. It can almost be considered more of a race, since you’re usually just trying to meet your objectives before the other guy. You’re generally not playing to eliminate or hinder your opponents, although, this can sometimes help you towards victory.

RATING: 8
First impression (4 players): I'm not usually a fan of this type of gameplay with plenty of troops on board and lots of fighting and back-and-forth going. Nexus ops very cleverly avoids the biggest problem of this type of games. Points are permanent, once gained they cannot be taken away. This means the game has more of a constant time it can be played in and won't take several hours. The gameplay is easy and clear. Also something worth mentioning.

Light, fun, and short skirmish game. At its best with two players, but four player team game is fine as well. The Secret Mission system does a great job of standardizing the length of the game, and it also keeps you on your toes all the time.

For a Hasbro game, the component quality is exceptional. I was very pleasantly surprised. Only the box, the monolith, and the player mats are of the usual Hasbro quality.

Fairly light wargame - though somewhat counter-intuitive - taking and holding territory is of second importance - playing a defensive game is a losing strategy - you must attack, attack, attack.

I think I'm just over this game due to the downtime. It is a shame because it's otherwise really well done. I'm also not sure why downtime bugs me so much in this one when I play Risk variants without issue. I'll have to think on it.

[b]Nexus Ops[/b] was reacquired* in a math trade (1/5/16)

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]:

[i]I actually regret selling this one; I actually forgot I had it listed in the marketplace and it sold months later... whoops. My original thoughts still stand and in the end I actually enjoyed it more than Kemet due to the simplicity of set up and teaching. I miss having a quick skirmish game in our collection, Memoir is great, but set up can be a bear.

I ended up getting a copy of the old Avalon Hill version since I like the minis better and it has the awesome center monolith. Also older daughter (now 10) loves Nexus Ops too.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8.5):[/COLOR]

[i]- Great replacement for Risk.
- Works really well as a 2p game.
- No player elimination, person to garner x victory points wins.
- The game encourages combat, that is how you get most of your VP.
- Fast set-up and gameplay, about 45 minutes to an hour.
- Beautiful minis for the units.
- Energize cards add to the replayability, especially combat.
- Alternate unit powers.
- Dice based combat is handled simply but allows for interesting decisions concerning which units to have fight.
- Set up of the board has some random elements which adds to the replay factor.

So far I have only played with my son so I am not sure how it will go over with the rest of the family. My older daughter wants to play and she could easily pick up the rules and understand the tactics of the game. The theme is fun, there is nothing gory about any of the artwork. I highly recommend this as a fun combat game to play with your kids.[/i]

Really elegant game system.  I like how hits are assigned and how you can protect your more valuable units with weaker ones.  It can help mitigate some of the luck of dice rolls. Very cool components too. I am glad I got the first edition. It really does the RTS thing well in a shorter time than Starcraft, which gives it a nice niche.

This game is a slam dunk for its design. It's fast and furious and fun: What else do you want in a game? 

There is also a fair amount of strategy as you try to conquer territory and use mining revenue to buy and employ some very nasty little aliens to do your dirty work for you. It's basically a war game set into a science fiction theme, with very cool plastic pieces of various sorts (Avalon-Hill version, which has, let's say, has a unique odor. 

I didn't find the rules difficult to understand (extensive Q & A are available on BGG), although the rule book is a case of what happens when a designer holds sway over an editor, as its layout is a bit confusing, and not all rules are explained clearly. However, it's nothing insurmountable. 

Looking forward to playing with 3 or 4 players, and trying out the team variant, which many Geeksters say is the optimal way to play. When my son Trevor, was 10 (in 2009), he rated it a 9.5. For non-gamers with no war game experience, this might be a little bewildering at first, as they might not be sure what to do on a turn, as there are many choices for strategy.

Simple tactical minis game whose main objective is to complete as many secret missions as possible. Key decisions include what units to produce with the available rubium in possession, normally driven by one's secret missions. Starting gambits are most commonly the same. I've a feeling Cry Havoc will dethrone this for me so as for now, it stays a 7. It is possible to utterly obliterate the opponent with good dice rolls and commanding presence atop the monolith.

Need more games of this. Enjoyed every game of it thus far but still not fully appreciated yet.

Got it on sale next door at Toys R' Us after passing on the Tangathon.  Played once with my wife.  Fun!!  You get all of the aggressive fun of Risk with more variety and it's fast!  Like a fast Risk 2210.  My wife liked it much better than any other conflict type game, which is to say she tolerates it.  My brother-in-law will love it.  I think you would often end in less than an hour if you know what you're doing.

RATING: 8
Great war game.  The cheesy Sci-Fi theme fits perfectly.  The game system works very well at encouraging aggressive combat.

To succeed you need to accomplish your Secret Mission cards as opposed to just trying to crush another player. When you get to do both it's especially sweet.

The units are well balanced and the flows well.

Feels like a much simpler version of starcraft.  It is not nearly as good, but it is what it is.  The game rules are very clear and simple, and the game plays in a reasonable amount of time.  Since I can't convince anyone to play starcraft, maybe I need to accept that this game may be the best I can get.  Still has good mechanics and resource management for deploying troops.

No pretensions here - it's a pure knock down, drag-em-out beat-em-up, with mission cards designed at preventing turtling and getting you out there beating 'em up. A turn is to build units, move 'em, then fight 'em in a nice quick combat dice system. Your two drivers are to control the spaces with mines to give you money to buy more units, and to win VPs thru achieving the mission cards. The big plus is that whining table talk is reduced to just fun stuff - everyone knows everyone's being driven by their mission cards, and if it's you getting beaten up as a result, it's understandable and an easy suck up. Fun for what it is.

Interesting alien hexagonal battlefield game where you control of a series of aliens and humans to mine rubian and attack other plyrs. Rubian gained can be used to purchase more characters. Battles gain you points and cards which may be used to help you on your way to victory. Very  cool glow in dark figures.

NEXUS OPS is the poster child of Ameri-Thrash, IMO!! Fun! Cool look and theme! Intuitive to teach (once I went over the rules a few dozen times)! This satisfies my Risk cravings, though Nexus Ops requires more flexibility due to so many random elements. About 30 to 40 minutes per player. Great design, feel of gameplay, and cool components to the first edition. 2nd Edition actually is a good production, and includes variants I have not yet tried. Both versions are eye catching when setup on a tabletop.

My gaming wife and I enjoy this 2 player !!!!!

Good game.  The original game has better art.

The FFG edition has more options, some of them interesting, but the components (figures, tiles and cards) are much more muddy in theme and effect.  No offense to the artists who may have worked hard, but the outcome here is artwork I really don't like.  

But being able to flip the unit card in the FFG game and have a whole new army adds some replay value and makes it a bit more interesting, although I'm not sure the alternates are balanced against the original units.

So the FFG edition is slightly worse and slightly better than the AH/Hasbro edition, depending upon what aspect of the game matters to you the most.

It's a great little war game. Random board layout and different powers of different creatures are plus points.

Fun little multiplayer wargame.  I like the symmetry in the game (that's preserved with any number of players), everyone has to fight a war on two fronts.  I'm a little concerned about the balance of the exploration tiles, it seems like you get a big advantage if you end up with most of the mines in front of your base (particularly if you're playing to a higher end score).

Good game - would much rather play this than Risk - will probably appeal to the same types of players. Advantages over Risk: Better combat system (interesting choices in army makeup), cool bits, nice secret mission system, cool changeable board. A solid 7. 3/06: This one is going to come out more now, it's caught on for those wanting their "Risk-fix". I like it 'cause it's over in 90 minutes or less. Jan'07: acquired second copy for $20 at TrU, will eventually use to play 5-8 player game.

Pointless game. Too much luck and randomness. During some plays, one player starts with a huge advantage by getting a bunch of "2" refineries by her/his home base. It's also annoying to get stuck with objective cards that require you to kill a particular unit when none of those units are even remotely close to yours. Perhaps some house rules can lessen the luck and randomness, but there are other games that do this sort of game style better. Components are nice, but the minis are a strange color and some of them look rather silly. I feel like it was meant as a lite version of Twilight Imperium or StarCraft, but I would much rather spend a few more hours and just play those games.

I hate energize cards even though they are a great way to balance game. They randomize the things away from strategies slightly a bit too much.

The turn order is simple: get money, buy, move, attack, draw secret mission. That continues until someone gets 12VP.

The game is heavily dice-driven.

Nice game. And very quick for being a confrontational war game. Since all VP are won by winning fights, the leader cannot just defend a strong map position to win! And the early exploration guarantees that people get out quickly and spread thin over the whole map. No turtling here. Great game in many ways.
Might rise to a 9 with more plays.

Liked it. Lovely neon coloured bits (smelly though). Dice are prone to either 1's or 6's though, but that could just be me :) Got distracted again by trying out the energize cards instead of focusing on getting vp's by winning battles, so there was some random stuff going on (at least on my part). Did figure the vp thing out after an hour or so :)

I’ve been wanting to try this for ages, and it did not disappoint. Nexus Ops gets right to the heart of the game and by turn 2, there were attacks all over the board.

Battle game with lots of dice rolling which manages to capture all the good elements of these kinds of games and plays in a very short time.

The mission cards do a good job of giving each player varied objectives rather than just obliterating everyone else!

In addition to the mission cards, the way the landscape is constructed & the hidden placement of the exploration tiles should ensure each game is different.

Fantastic components.

More fluid than Risk, and MUCH shorter. The game almost forces you to be aggressive as opposed to hanging back and building up your army. Can't wait to play this again.

This is a marvelous dudes on the map game. The game has a nice variety of figures who have easy to understand abilities. The minis (in the original version) are fun looking and glow under blacklight. The points system is also very easy as points get awarded for combat, or playing the card to claim credit for having created a specific board state. The game is very clever in that it properly incentives you to spread your forces thin early on, to try to hold the risky center of the map, to attack and win, or to defend and lose.  

I don't think this game would work well with less than exactly 4, which is limiting. Also, sadly for me the game uses dice for combat, which can be frustrating at times, since the best laid plans can be foiled by luck. That being said, if I'm going to play a dudes on the map game with dice, this one is by far the most elegant. It has everything good from the heavier games and none of the extra rules weight and fluff.

7.5 - Only played my first real game of this but I can see the potential in it.  It doesn't have that crush of emotion because you usually only fight one round of combat per zone per turn but it is dice chucking and area control and fun.  I think I would like it a bit more if you had to option to push your luck and keep fighting over a zone, but that would give the player with slightly better units a huge advantage.

Good, simple game. Many niceties like different units, different terrain and such that feel tightly put together. This game is packed with great ideas, ballance is awesome but still interesting.

It also seems to get more enjoyable the more I play it, which is good!

I must say I am not a fan of victory conditions by secret mission and such, but this game is the best possible incarnation of such idea as I can imagine.

Component quality is also a plus, the minis look and feel great.

An interesting take on the 'Risk' genre. It's not about defending but clever timing of attacks and managing your troops and money at the same time. The game almost feels like boardgame with some take-that gameplay. However, despite the fact that it looks very tactical and intricate, it does sport a very high degree of randomness, many die rolls and random card powers. The game is short and light-hearted enough that I don't mind, but it is definitely more at home in the Ameritrash-division than Euro and I might not always be up for so much randomness in my games as the lack of control is really more apparent than in many other games that are similar. The bits and pieces are very nice, it's a shame that the cards and tiles are ugly, kind of cancels the nice miniatures to a degree. A good game, not for everyone.

Played once with my brother and we both loved it. I know they're very different games, but I no longer have any desire to own Smallworld or to keep Summoner Wars after playing Nexus Ops.

I was the first player and managed to get and hold the monolith for the entire game. I also got really lucky and killed two of his Rubium Dragons in one battle (which also satisfied a secret agenda card). We played a short game and I ended up winning 10 to 8, but it really could have been anyone's game all the way to the end. Even after I killed his dragons and went on a rampage wiping out his units, he was still satisfying secret agenda cards on every turn and keeping up with me.

Fantastic game. We sat up late thinking of other fun tweaks you could do (single player, co-op, teams, etc) and based on how many variants are included in the rulebook, this is a good one for tweaking.

After weeks of trying to work out a 3-way trade, I finally aquired a NiS copy of the AH edition of Nexus Ops yesterday. The person who traded with even threw in a bag of red gems in two different sizes for Rubium. To further pimp out my copy, I picked up a copy of Ligretto Dice today. It includes four dice cups; a dice bag; and transparent dice, 6 each in red, yellow, green and blue.

RATING: 6
An abstract war game, and that's my biggest problem with this game. Personally, if I'm playing a game with war game mechanics, it must be heavy with theme and chrome. 

War games typically have extreme high and low dramatic moments -- high moments are large, fiercely contested battles, and the low ones involve rebuilding units and maneuvering them. Nexus Ops is no exception. However, war games have themes and and a historical lushness that keep you entertained during these low moments -- Nexus Ops doesn't.

Score is conditional - only if game is to be played by gamers of similar game approach. Not a good game for casual gamers or mixed groups. But if so... -
Nice balance of multiple strategies, changing based on your secret mission cards and board layout. Excellent BALANCED, aggressive wargame to scratch the itch in half the time other games do.
Nexus Ops has basically obsoleted Risk and its ilk, because it succeeds at preventing the turtling problem inherent in so many games of its kind. The aggression required in Nexus Ops prevents stalemate positions and by design it reduces the amount of diplomacy (i.e ganging up, lying, backstabbing) traditionally that drags down games like this.

A light fun strategy game with a lot of interesting features that add to the depth of strategy and create variety between games, cool little toys to play with, and simple battle rules.  Just enough luck for my taste.  Lots of options for a player to choose from on his turn, and you feel like you're in control of your own destiny - mostly.  (Have you noticed the HUGE number of people who rated it 8, with relatively few rating it 9 or 10?  It's a nice light game that's a lot of fun to play -- but I guess it'll never be a GREAT game, and that's ok.)

I do enjoy this game. It is a fast paced area control game that takes about an hour, and offers some different variations to keep it fresh.

+speed
It felt like a good amount of time. Downtime was absolutely minimal with no insanely difficult decisions. Often players get swamped by the amount of choices whether it is what units to buy, how many of each, who to attack, etc. The VP cards help guide decision to make. They will say specific conditions where you meet to get a point. It makes decisions clearer and turns faster. Battles are quick with a few dice rolled and then your turn is over. The game I played must have lasted an hour or less. Compare that to a 4 hour game of Risk 2210!

+bits
The sculpts are colored very well and the designs are all different. The figures do not really seem to match a common theme but I do not really mind.

+energize cards
This is what puts Nexus Ops ahead of many other games. Even though the loser of a battle just lost a great deal of men, the energize cards can help him out a great deal. To balance the cards from being too powerful, they are useful only in certain situations, which also makes it fun (and possible) trying to come back.

+close game
I think it's nearly impossible to completely eliminate someone in this game. That plus the energize cards makes the game always closely matched, which makes sense for players who are behind to keep playing.

+VP cards
I love this system. You only win in the game when you get to a certain amount of points. It means that a player who has been dominated in battles the entire game can still win rather than feeling helpless. It makes battles meaningful and different rather than 10 turns fighting over the same hex. As mentioned the goals also lower downtime by having players focus their actions in specific area.

+unique stats
It's great how the units you buy are different in their own way. I like seeing different abilities than just "unit B costs more than unit A because it just does more damage than A." It makes the game more strategic and rewards great play.

-monolith
I felt drawing 2 energize cards a turn might be too much. Maybe 1 a turn would be better? It the game I play, one opponent got enough free rubium to build 2 dragons and who also won the game. My opinion on this is neutral.

-identical players
The game is awesome, but I would have loved to see some unique powers between players. Perhaps each could make a unique unit, have a unique deck of energize cards, etc. Not a big deal, but would be cool.

In essence, you got the sheer brutalness of a wargame, but you cut out the problems such as a long playtime and player elimination.

I enjoy the explore aspect of this game.  It's neat and it reminds me of exploring in the Civilizations computer game.  I think the combat system is neat and well set up.  But I don't really enjoy combat games.  If I were to be in the mood for a direct combat game, this would probably be my preferred option, but I don't particularly like combat games.  In fact, if I were to play Nexus Ops with more than two people I'd probably rate it even lower because there would be less of the exploring that I enjoy and more of the slaughtering my pretty lizards.  I get so sad when my lizards get killed.

I want to say something positive . . . this game has very cool looking pieces.  It reminds me of a ripped-off version of Starcraft wrapped around a flawed game of Risk or Axis and Allies.  I would try it again to see if I just got caught into a bad situation.  Everyone else looked like they were really enjoying themselves, so maybe I missed something.  Looking at BGG comments, it looks like we misplayed the Energize cards.  (Note: The misplayed Energize cards may account for 1-2 Rating points.).

The old Avalon Hill classic brought back to life by Fantasy Flight Games.  A fun area control, creatures on a map game with hidden agendas and just enough rules chrome to make it interesting for avid gamers and newcomers alike.

After 1 two-player game, this could be one of my favorite battle games. I really like how just about everything is modular, from the map to the many different score cards players can draw.

A lightweight dicefest. Good features include the modular terrain, the short duration, and the constant influx of new and varied secret objectives, which make this game more tactical than strategic.

This is a fast paced version of Axis and Allies that doesn't weight the game in one player's favor from the beginning. That said, combat is still pretty simplistic and the random bonus tiles can really throw off the game. The scoring system doesn't really balance the game out and, without an attack limiter like Runewars, late game swings can knock a player out of the running, without eliminating them from the game.

A grade version of Risk (like runewars)

I think this is a good fast paced "dudes on the map" that encourages attacking and controlling the middle of the board. It is a good thing that there is a small compensation for the defender when he loses a fight. Yet, there is a chance of steamroll in the 2p-game and getting "a neckhold" in the result of bad luck means that the game will eventually end in the favor of the other player, no matter what you do. I think the 4p-game could the way to go with a lot of happening and other players balancing the game if one player gets a major lead early on in the game.

(3/4/08) - Just bought this today from Crossroad Games, an LGS.

(4/2/08) - [7.5] - Played this today for the first time. I ended up losing pretty handily because of not paying attention to the secret mission cards. This is a light dice-rolling combat game with nice random terrain so that things don't get too stale. The addition of the secret mission and energize cards help mitigate a good portion of the luck.

(7/30/08) - [6] - After a second play I feel my rating must be readjusted. The game is still fun, but seems to have some issues. The secret mission aspect gives players something to strive for, but makes the combat feel disjointed. What's the point in trying to win a series of battles when you can just as easily get 3VPs by killing a certain unit?

(5/1/13) - Nexus Ops has been sold as part of a larger liquidation of my collection. I didn't play it enough to justify keeping it.

As a gateway battle game - I would rate it 9.5.

004. Looks like a cheesy sci fi geek or kids game but is a superb battle game, lots of fun, very smooth play, It is the business in contrast to Dust which looks the business but game play is tedious and the battle mechanic often a let down [it's been suggested in my gaming group that Dust would be way better if it had the fighting mechanics of Nexus Ops]. Far superior to risk, much more competitive and brain engaging. You feel that you actually accomplish something playing it while also being light fun.

Streamlined war game with a fun theme and cool translucent pieces. I like the exploration element and the fact that this game focuses on objectives instead of destroying the other players. These objectives leave you guessing what the other people are up to; they often cause some interesting and unexpected moves which always keeps you on your toes.

A game of close quarters and combat but in a nice package.  Helping me enjoy this game - each side has the same types of units.  The secret missions drive the game forcing combat resulting in a game that plays relatively quickly.

great even without a blacklight.  This is a good example of how multi-player combat games should be done to avoid turtling, kingmaking, and player elimination while still having lots of combat and destruction.

RATING: 7
Fun game but as with other diced based war games, very luck based. However, there are still many tough decisions to be made and the power cards does help balance out the bad dice rolls.  The objective cards are also very luck based as you need the right  conditions to achieve those objectives, and a lot of the times you have no control over those conditions.  Still a fun and tension filled game.

RATING: 7
Nexus Ops does a good job of combining a lot of existing board game mechanics and distilling them down to a simple playable form.  The Mission Cards do a good job of changing player strategy at every sitting.  The main problem is that the game can quickly degenerate into an arms race of who can put the most pieces on a given hex (completely counter to the bite sized combats suggested by the design). Overall fun and easily accessible to new gamers with a pretty tight rules system.

Standard game has just enough for light and fun wargame and avoids burdening itself with anything else. Additional components and optional rules give you tremendous customization and variety for years. A perfect game of this type with only one thing that bothers me: dear FFG, please put more dice in the box, dammit! Seriously! I haven't played a single game where I didn't have to borrow more dice elsewhere. Other than that - nothing to address, a very solid game.

RATING: 8
09-12-2014. Rated after 1 play. Fun, 4X-ish light combat game. Turns are quickly, each unit moves 1 step (or depending on special abilities more). Then if multiple units are in one hex, combatis triggered. After combat is resolved, at the end of the turn, you get a special victory objective card that rewards killing a certain creature type or control a certain amount of terrain types..

During combat, the fastest/biggest units are resolved first and hit on the lowest numbers. All units of a type, from both players are resolved at the same time. For each hit, a unit is killed. You may chose to remove a unit that has already attacked (a more expensive unit) or a cheap unit that would still have a chance to attack.

If you win combat as an attacker, you get a VP. If you obtain a special objective from a card you got (ie. kill a strong creature or what have you) you can get multiple VPs. The first player with 12 VPs wins. Game is light, fast and fun. Good quality mini's but the artwork on the tiles is relatively busy.

This game is filled with wonderful reasons to like it.

:d10-1: Awesome theme
:d10-2: Great, unique plastic figures
:d10-3: Units with variable powers that are implemented well. Each has a value and a purpose. There are no useless pieces.
:d10-4: Modular game board so the map is slightly different each game.
:d10-5: Hidden objectives.
:d10-6: Energize cards that shake up the battle and give players special one shot advantages. They are awarded in such a way as to help combat losers and hopefully prevent a runaway leader situation.
:d10-7: An exploration mechanic which further randomizes the board each play.
:d10-8: A relatively short playtime for 2-4 players.
:d10-9: Terrain that effects tactics and gameplay.
:d10-0: Option to play as all against all or 2 vs 2 with 4 players.
:D Really Fun!

Here's what's not to like:
:d6-1: The component quality of the monolith. Really? What a flimsy piece. What's that all about? Screams for a do it yourself improvement, which many have done.
:d6-2: Too bad the rubium tokens weren't instead represented as some kind of glass or plastic bead for flavor.

The unfortunate irony here is that because of the number of my gamer friends available, who are few and spread all over the country, this game has only been played a couple of times. In all the years I've had it it should have seen many more plays. I hope to remedy that in the future as this game is so [b]fun[/b] and worth keeping. So worth the $10 I paid for it when my FLGS was unloading it in the very early 2000's.

--Feb2007-- It's not too bad, all things considered.  While it has the superficial veneer of a mindless dice-fest, it really isn't:  the 12 VPs happen far too fast for one to win if irrelevant actions are taken.

Not bad for what it is. Better (and shorter) than Risk. Similarities to Twilight Imperium - Nexus Ops has many of the same mechanics, but nowhere near the depth or complexity (or play time) of TI. Dice based combat and the confusing movement phase (when many units are present) hurt this one a bit. Fun to play - that's what counts. Component quality is mixed (awesome plastic units, but cheap cardboard game tiles).

Impressions after first play: A distillation of most of the cool things about DOAMs. What makes this flow at a steady, quick pace is the fact that everyone keeps getting new goals with no effort to it and that rubium is plentiful. What makes this work with three is that the goals of the game are detached from anyone specifically. You don't have to eliminate someone to win, you don't have to have the most land area. You just net points for objectives that target certain types of units in certain locations. It doesn't make thematic sense, but it's the only thing you have to forgive to enjoy the game. The dice, the cards, the alternate units, variants and random setup guarantee variety. Rubium, while plentiful, is also just right. No one gets too much and too far ahead.

That this is (as of writing) the 161st highest rated game in the world is patently ludicrous: it has the chance common to all dice-driven games, and then exacerbates it by making cards also critical.

That said, I really like this game. I think it takes me back to the Axis & Allies-style games I loved as a teenager, except without the part where it takes eight hours and the Allies always win.*  My girlfriend and I are both devoted Eurogamers, but we still get a hankering for some dice-driven lava-leaping rock-striding stupidity every few months.

*I understand that more recent editions have fixed some of the balance issues, but I've never played them.

As great as I expected it would be. Have only played 2 and 3 player games so far. 4 players must be a riot. Monolith is great, but doesn't seem absolut essential to give you the edge to win the game (last game had two players fighting over the monolith, while the third snatched the victory). Some lucky dice rolls can't hurt either though.

RATING: 7
I would like Nexus Ops a lot more if it weren't for the problem of remembering which of my pieces have moved or not. This practically kills it for me. I don't quite understand how wargamers willingly deal with this problem. My guess is they either meticulously track all moved pieces using some sort of system (way to fiddly for me) or they tolerate movement errors (goes against my purist nature).

Light multiplayer wargame in which battles are guaranteed because the factions are very close in the modular map.  It is not that important to control territories, except maybe the mines and the central monolythe, but to achieve victory points completing different missions that players draw from a pile during the game.  That allows to have a chance to win even when you are not in the lead.  Great components, simple gameplay, intuitive, fast paced and tense, with room for some strategy and crucial decisions and some luck (a big amount actually); definitively a very good option to scratch the fighting itch that every gamer has.

Great replay value attested by continued requests to play.

Only 1 play, with 4.  I can see why this is so popular.   It's a little like Risk but with a lot more fun.  Simple rules offering decent choices and seems like it's well designed.  The game is never going to go on for too long (especially if you play with reduced no. of VP's) and it seems fairly tight.

The fast and furious play time and anti-turtling philosophy in Nexus Ops can make you very thankful for it, especially if you've played Risk, Axis & Allies or any of the similar "old classics" (euphemism for lose an entire day or two from your life). But this game is not satisfying at all, since the modular board just doesn't convey the grand scale of epic conquest a world map can, and you get rewarded for doing stupid things like starting battles in two places. The game always ends right when things start to get interesting, and rewards the player who draws lucky objectives and is best at bending over backwards to fulfill them, not the person who made the shrewdest maneuvers.

The one thing that bugs me the most is the hidden special mission objectives. It's just weird and chaotic to not know what your opponent is aiming for, and takes away from rolling dice and fighting big battles. I would have preferred it a lot more if Nexus Ops followed the variant Risk games out there in providing more types of combat cards (a.k.a. scrap the Special Missions and include more/cooler Energize cards and ways to get them). Hidden special powers are tolerable, but hidden special missions aren't, especially when they completely corrupt the spirit of world domination.

If I'm going to play a multiplayer conflict game I'd almost always prefer to play something big and epic, like Twilight Imperium, Starcraft or A Game of Thrones or whatever. But in the lightweight class, this game is hard to beat. It reduces the genre to its bare essences (build guys and kill your opponent's guys) in a way that is both highly functional and fun to play.

The game can be set up quickly, explained in ten minutes or less and played in under an hour. You score victory points almost exclusively by attacking your opponent, which is a very effective way to discourage lame turtling.

This was a wonderful little dicefest that I would happily choose to play over Risk if ever given the chance.  Sure, there is a lot of luck involved in the game and the dice can be cruel to you, but it is a lot of fun.  The cards available as well as the varying resources and unit abilities provide enough interesting decisions to suit me.  The cool little dayglow miniature are just an added bonus.  I can imagine that this would not appeal to everyone -- but what game does?  I like it for what it is, nothing more.  And for the record, I really like the box art.  [08/10/2007]

RATING: 8
A simplified game of collecting resources, using them to buy troops, and then battling opponents with your new units. Tactics are a bit strange since every unit has one hit point, and every unit does one point of damage on a successful attack. The battle strength difference in units have to do with their probability of hitting, each getting higher (along with the cost of the unit) across the 6 unit types. Other differences mainly have to do with special attacks, movement, and mining resources.

Definitely a lot of randomness due to dice rolling to determine battle outcomes, random tile exploration early in the game, and random secret mission cards throughout the game (which are your main source of VP's other than winning battles).

Still, aside from all that randomness it has seemed to me that the person with the best tactics, choices, and select board control still wins the game. At under an hour playtime, its a great game to play.

The advantages over Risk is that it is a bit prettier, you have different troop types that have differing costs and advantages/disadvantages mainly based on terrain, you have several mission and booster cards that mix it up a lot, and it is quicker. So, actually it is a lot better than Risk. But it still suffers from die rolls (fun for some, frustrating for others) which can easily make or break you and who you are start next to can have a great effect. The cards have a large effect, which was one complaint, but i did not find this an issue as you cycle through them quick enough and if you don't like them you can cash them in for a gold(that would be rubium).
Revising this rating up as enjoying playing with enthusiastic kids ;)

Taken as a whole, [b]Nexus Ops[/b] falls firmly into a well-populated category - undercooked, overly ambitious crap. Were it not for the garish colors and figures, the idiosyncratic rules and supply stupidity would have convinced me this was a [b]Richard Berg[/b] design.

Any of you who consider yourselves wargamers should stay far, far away from this mess.

Seems to be a good game for its type (light war game), with some Eurogame elements. I don't like dice based combat, however, so it's not my type of game. Even so, the random incremental mission draw mechanic adds unnecessary luck and detracts from the strategy. These should be available from the beginning of the game in a pool or auction mechanic.

Played multiple times with 2P and 3P. Despite my limited experience with Ameritrash-type games, Nexus Ops fills in a niche in my collection. The gameplay moves quickly and requires some actual strategy in choosing which units to buy and attack. Of course, there are huge swings in luck, especially in the initial exploration of tiles (revealing Rock Striders is usually a good thing as it allows the player to quickly gain control of the monolith) and the secret objective cards, which sometimes requires players to plan out peculiar strategies. I prefer the game with 3P over 2P as it forces battles earlier, although there will be a lot more negotiating involved. Once the game is in progress, the board looks pretty psychedelic with the day-glo pieces on the tiles.

[11 plays] Nexus Ops is everything it aims to be - ultra cool looking, fast moving, easily understandable, beer & pretzels combat, and very fun. I enjoyed it very much. There is some depth here that will keep me coming back for more.

This is a great gateway wargame for kids. Something that needs to be emphasized to new players is that Nexus Ops is a race to 12 mission victories. This means that traditional wargame strategies of build up and maneuver still apply, but that no player can afford to fail to complete some sort of major or minor battle victories on every turn practicable without losing ground in the race to victory.

The bits alone are worth the $15 that you can easily find this for. This is a cleverly constructed game system. The monolith benefits, the mission cards, the energize cards, and the nifty combat system are all terrifically interesting ways to drive the play and motives of the players.

I think this is best as a 3 player game, as a dead front between 2 players in a 4 player contest will break the game.

Set in the future, players are 'corporations' trying to strip a fictious planet of a precious resource named Rubium. They recruit creatures and mine for 'money' in order to recruit more creatures.

The creatures are the bulk of the game: they are needed for battles which in turn give VPs towards victory.

In addition, secret missions give players VPs. First to 12 vp wins.

It's a dicefest with alot of agony and screaming. I liked it. It plays fairly fast and is totally unoriginal; yet it works. Yes, your victory or demise hinges on the die roll, but you improve the odds with energize cards or by using terrain to the advantage of the creature race.

Heck, humans are cheap, if you hate attacking with one leaper at 3+ to hit or one dragon with 2+ to hit, buy 8 or 12 humans and attack with the lot. You have 8 or 12 chances to roll a six. That's ALOT of dice. Get the energize card that gives you +2 to a roll and you're going to unleash a world of hurt...

A very distinctive looking game, thanks to the translucent plastic bits. I like the way the secret mission cards add to what is happening on the board. The cards make the tactics more interesting than a standard axis and allies type of game, but more prone to the influence of luck as well. Not deep, but fast and fun.

Nexus Ops feels like an old school game from the late 80's. The rules are Risk-like, predictable and very easy to learn. Willing to play sometimes in the right mood. The central "monolith" looks crappy, but the units are exceptionally nice, especially the colors are quite striking.

The awesome looking "glow in the dark" edition. I love the fact that everything revolves around secret missions. This solves the problem of many tactical war games, that are either about all-out attacks, area domination or alliances. In this game, having the biggest army, dominating the most area or negotiating the most beneficial alliance won't necessarily win you the game, if you don't know how to achieve the right secret objectives at the right time.

Fantastic little smash-em-up resource acquisition game.  It's good to go into this with your teeth bared.  The game encourages some wily playing as you try to push forward to tackle objectives.  

This game does a fine job of negating the turtling strategy as you have to get out and get points to win.  There is a great consolation prize for getting your ass kicked as well, which softens the blow a bit. The game isn't hugely innovative, if you roll poorly you aren't going to win the game, but I find that it has been boiled down to its essence.  Just enough chrome to maintain the theme, but this system is clean and elegant.  Great fun.

Every time I play one of the other "punch each other player to your right/left" kind of game I always look back to this.  Why bother with games like Starcraft...this is just all out better.

I believe this is the greatest game of its genre, it has made games obsolete and I suspect will continue to dominate the field for years.

The dice can be frustrating, but it feels like this is a good old-fashioned combat slugfest that just happens to have taken every important lesson of Euros to heart. It's a lot of fun, quick to play, and admirably fills a niche that's otherwise surprisingly vacant

Ignored, marginalized, dismissed.  It looks like something you'd find at the 5-10 year old section of Toys'R'Us.  The parts stink when you open them at first.  The theme is nonsensical.  You read the rules and say to yourself 'I could have slapped this together in a afternoon!'

But it keeps coming back to the table.

I love this game. I had first rated it a 9 after 3-4 plays but the more I play it the more I love it. It's simple enough to teach someone in a few minutes, plays relatively quickly and works well with 2, 3 or 4 players. The random board and secret missions make every game seem fresh and the diversity in the 6 different units is just great. It also looks really great and attracts peoples attention when you play it in public (despite some bad card/map art in my opinion). It's a fairly luck based war game though. So anyone who isn't a fan of those types of games probably won't like this that much. I, on the other hand, can't get enough of it. I think this game is seriously underrated and I actually think if it had a better theme and nicer artwork (the box is hideous) it would get a lot more attention. I'd love to see this revised with new bits and artwork some day but I don't see it happening any time soon. One of my all-time favourites.

Great little combat game that is simple to learn and has plenty of eye candy to boot.  The modular board creates nice replayability, the pieces are well-balanced, and while you might opportunistically attack another player, you general look for ways to carry out your secret missions, which help prevent too much ganging up on one player.  Overall, an elegant design as long and plenty of fun as long as you can tolerate randomness with dice.  Likely to move to a 9 with another play or two.

I will admit that I think dice hate me, which is probably why I gravitate more towards Euros, or at least other types of games that tend not to screw me repeatedly. If I'm going down in flames, I'd just rather have myself (or another person) to blame than the crappy dice results I roll again and again. Given my feelings about dice, then, this rating isn't too shabby, as Nexus Ops is a pretty good game in spite of the dice. I just realized while playing this that I much prefer to have more control over my own fate, rather than be held hostage to these cruel, pox-ridden plastic cubes.

This is the anti-Eurogame.  It's garish, horribly violent, involves throwing abound buckets of dice, and had a pretty large luck factor.  It's got the board of Settlers (the eyesore Mayfair edition)and the combat resolution of Axis and Allies.  It's  shamelessly ugly in an endearing sort of way.  Its rules are a hodgepodge almost every game idea of the last 10 years (If it only had bidding for variable player order it would hit them all).  With all of this against it, it should be a dog.  In actuality it's a very fun light wargame, and the art suits the theme.  The rules are clear and work well.

Nice little conquest battle game.  I like the random map and the random exploration tiles placement.  The game "forces" you to try for the center of the board causing conflict.  In my one play, I totally out-resourced my son; but he controlled the center and crushed me in VP’s.  I thought for sure my resource advantage would have turned the game in my favor, but aggressively acquiring VP’s seems to be the key.

I found this pretty dang boring, although everyone else who played it seemed to like it.

We've found this to me moderately entertaining with 3 or 4, as a quick and very very simple confrontational game.  It can drag on however, if one of the 4 plays quite defensively--an annoying possibility with some player-types due to the completely symmetrical sides.  

With 2 players however, it is a waste of time when you could be playing Commands and Colors:Ancients or Battle Lore--we prefer C&C:A, but both play in the same time or quicker that Nexus Ops, and they are deeper tactically and strategically.

While not really "Twilight Imperium Light" like I've heard, it's actually really good. The secret objectives are what raises this above other conventional axis and allies-esque war games into something that rewards multi-turn ahead planning.

RATING: 8.5
For the longest time I avoided purchasing this game despite the rave reviews it received from the AT crowd.  I would look at it every now and then, but each time would be turned off by the "cheesy space creatures" imagery (I tend to prefer that my games of conflict have some sort of historical feel).  Eventually I found it cheap on eBay and finally caved in, and now I realize what everyone was raving about.  "Nexus Ops" truly does take all the best elements of the classic "plastic wars" games and distills them down into a simple, intense free-for-all, with a modular board, variable unit powers, and elements of exploration thrown in to boot.  And most games end up being fairly close.  Even when you are down a bit, one turn can really turn the tide, as was evidenced by the two-player game in which I was down by 6 VPs and was about to lose, only to achieve 8 points in one turn and win the game!  Of course, the fact that this sort or ridiculous swing is even possible is a bit of a negative point with this game.  Now my next purchase will have to be a black light.  Game design: 4.5/5  Personal enjoyment: 4/5  Total: 8.5/10

Great game --a lot of fun with a group.  I find this to be a good gateway game for non-gamers; it is attractive, intuitive, and the nature of the mission cards always provides guidance to reduce the "I don't know what to do" factor.

RATING: 9
FuFun wargame with plenty of thigns in place to prevent turtling or endless games.    Not for those who can't stand significant luck element.  Played three way and teams and greatly enjoyed both, our gameplay has gone quite quickly over tiem and the game is growing a lot on my play group.     
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Not my kind of game -- super-light wargame heavy on the luck-factor. (Dice, random draws, etc.)

It's designed to force fast and aggressive play, though, and that I can appreciate. You only score victory points by killing enemy units, mostly by winning battles; you have hidden objectives to encourage you to make tactically-poor moves to get those VP. The monolith in the centre of the board gives significant advantage to whichever player holds it, providing incentive to fight over it.

Best with 4 players, I reckon, to amplify the chaos. With fewer you might want to think about strategy, and that's not what this game is good at.

RATING: 7
This game seems to take all the good elements of Risk and ditch all the bad elements.  It features great bits, a touch of strategy, a modular board, and a nice playing time.  Simply put, the game is a lot of fun and you definitely should play it if you like direct conflict games.  I only wish they did a better job with the Monolith production.  The other complaint I have is that the goal cards can be rather random and strange at times (e.g., simply get into a battle with another X-type of creature).  Since when did just entering a battle, and then losing it, become a method of earning victory points?  Seems strange to me and eliminates the need to actually play to win battles.  Fortunately there don't seem to be many of these kinds of cards in the deck, but they show up enough to annoy me.

[2 plays] Initial reaction rating.  I played a two and three player games of this now.  I was pleasantly surprised at how much I liked this.  It was very easy to learn, and had a theme that my son enjoyed.  It played at a good pace and was an overall interesting game to learn and try out.  I had passed on trying this game several times, because I am just not into these sci-fi-ish lighter wargames.  This game is a little lighter and has more dice rolling than I like, but for playing against a nine year old it fit okay.  I would certainly not mind playing this against my son a few more times.  I am not sure I would consider it a great choice for my regular gaming group, or my co-workers.

RATING: 8
4/23/10: Quick, lightweight wargame.  Wargames aren't really my genre, but this is fast-paced and light enough that I enjoy it.  The bits are incredibly eye-catching, and the exploration tiles and Secret Mission add nice incentives for being aggressive.  Rather than having to drive your opponents extinct, you just need to get a certain amount of points from battles and associated gains, so the game doesn't drag on, and you are often encouraged to make non-optimal moves in order to fulfill missions.  Nice to break out once in awhile.

Like the modular board and clear pieces but a bit heavy on the resource management even in a light game for my taste. Curious to see what the FFG remake will do mechanic-wise. Might give it another shot.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I don't have alot of experience in "old school" gaming, so the fact that this has been pegged as unoriginal doesn't bother me in the slightest. The secret mission cards are a nice touch and they can lead to some not-so-obvious tactics (Why did he kill off his Strider instead of his Human? Oh, he gets two points if he wins a battle with a surviving Human!)
We learned quickly that the monolith (rather flimsy bit for a $45 game, Mr. Hill) was *the* place to be. If one player controls it for too long, things will start to deteriorate very quickly for the other players. Battle for the monolith should happen early and often.

A real blast and a solid effort from the AH team.

Kind of feels like a playable (shorter) version of Twilight Imperium.  Of course it's way, way more simple than that and a lot of the stuff that's good about TI3 is missing in this game.  The pieces are surprisingly nice for an Avalon Hill game, but still it IS an Avalon Hill game so we get crappy cards and slightly clunky rules.  It was better than I expected it to be and I'd happily play it again so that's saying something.

RATING: 9.5
Very well designed, tense little game. It's not going to replace my big, long backstabbity strategy games, it's an excellent game for a normal afternoon or evening play. 

It's complexity level (a hair more than risk) makes it easy to teach and the lack of special rules make it easy to just jump right in. 

It's a balanced 3 player strategy game, a feat alone that should warrant a look from anyone remotely interested. 

The more I play, the more I'm impressed by the design, which really cuts out a lot of unnecessary chaff in favor of immediate killing and getting "right to it."

Is it as good as Twilight Imperium or Civilization? Nope. Is it better and faster than Risk? Yep.

Played 5+ times.  I really like the brutal nature of this game.  The victory point structure and the victory point cards really drive you to a lighting quick aggressive game.  It's pretty tactical and you should focus on achieving your secret missions to win.  I've read comments of people who play this as a much more build up and attack game and I don't think I would enjoy that aspect.  As a 1-1.5 hr dice fest it's quite fun.  I'm actually surprised that I like this because I don't generally enjoy multiplayer combat games.  As a result my rating feels unstable to me and probably still has lots of room to move.  **UPDATE** I think the rating is stable.  This game is good.  There's luck in if you get useful mission cards and where the mines come out but it's pretty quick and fun. 2008/11/03

Streamlined, fast playing, no-nonsense wargame.

Has everything needed: varied army units, discoveries, a basic economy, a varied but balanced map, unexpected trick cards and a mechanism to prevent excessive bashing on a player (the more you reach into his territory, the longer supply lines to your base become and the shorter his). Top it off with (open) victory point based win condition and all games will get tense at the end.

All in all, great game, glad I own. Go to wargame if we don't want to plough through a lot of rules and are just up for some quick and fun bashing. Too bad it only plays 4.

[APR 2017] Though this is a keeper for the 'fast light wargame' spot, basic tactic is down: put lots of humans on the map to dissuade invasion, explore fast and hope for lots of spiders with which to try and hold the central spot for as long as you can. Let the cards take you from there. Easy, fast and not that exciting if you can also play Chaos in the Old World or A Game of Thrones. These do take more time and are somewhat more complex, though. But in the 'kids' spot it has been trumped by Conquest of Planet Earth so the niche is 'wargaming with "new" gamers on a time-limit' only. Oh well, maybe we should just try out the backside of the units and see if that spices up things.

An ok game played with the right players. Could devolve into pointless head-butting. The usual principles of economic development and focusing on VP conditions, so the game doesn't offer anything special. Yes, it's better than Risk, but that's a pretty low standard.

Although the game had reputedly been played often before, the plastic reeked. The smell was strong, even with the A/C fan turned on. The game would probably be a buy except for the extremely annoying smell.

I'm not happy with the production. I think the art of the tiles really sucks. Someone probably drew the 4 different terrain types in 4 hours. I guess I'm spoiled by some of the nice art in other games. Also, I'll probably need to find something else for the Monolith since I've assembeled it TWICE now and it's starting to show signs of not holding together right. I don't like the semi-transparent pieces since it makes it a harder to tell them apart when they're bunched together in a hex.
  
On the gameplay side, I think the game is decent. It's a step up from some other Risk-type of games. There's no difference between any of the colors (except for color) if someone is looking for that aspect in the game. I think that the victory points work well and discourage turtleing. Some of the energize cards can be extra powerful if used at a critical time, but nothing is completely unfair. Exploration tiles can fall down in a way that the big mines are closer and therefore easier to defend for one player. Terrain effects are nice since each type has a special effect on atleast one creature. The variety and special ability of the creatures makes it worth buying more than just one type. The Mololith causes a "king of the hill" side-game going on at the same time. Worth playing a few more times atleast.

A good light wargame.  My only real problem is that the tiles are so small that the game doesn't feel as "epic" as something like Risk with a big fold-out board.  I really prefer the mission-based victory point system rather than total conquest, and the energize cards are a great balancing system.

Rating after 3 plays. I'm not a fan of wargames per se, but the mission cards give Nexus Ops a more euro flavor and give it variety. It's hard to be totally beaten down, even when the game involves you in so many skirmishes. Plays fast and keeps you involved.

Fairly light game with some decent strategy, but the luck of the exploration tiles can really affect one's position. Also, the Energizer cards are sometimes very powerful and can swing a game. If played in a light-hearted sort of way, this can be a good game. The one game I played took almost 2 hours, which was too long for this sort of game, but that was probably because we are all newbies to the game. I will have to play it one more time to see if this is a keeper.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Nexus Ops generates a constant flow of mission cards into each hand so that one goal can be pursued while waiting for the next good one to arrive.  That's a lot of luck even for a tactical war game, but it makes the game lighter and it works.  I'd prefer larger hexes and more better sculpts, though.  A good battle looks like a warm bag of Gummibears.

If you play with gamers, this is a relatively quick war game (I played with new gamers, took hours lol). I love the secret objective cards, I also like how you can exchange useless ones for money.

This game has an advantage compared to other Risk-like board games concerning battles.

Update 06/26/2012: After a few more plays I still like this game a lot. It may not have an incredible amount of depth, but it's fun to spend an hour or so building up your army and battling it out.

My friends and I are doing a Risk night soon (with LOTR Trilogy Extended Editions playing in the background... it's going to be an epic day!).  But I keep telling them "I wish we had Nexus Ops! It's so much more fun!"  Only played it once (and don't remember being good at it) but it was a lot of fun and I love the pieces... the Lava Leapers are adorable... and I thought for the entire game that the Rock Strider's butt was his front. Oops :)

Just right, just long enough.  Exploration is tasty and brief, and before you know it you're hacking at people on 2 sides.  Plenty of back-and-forth, and I love how the secret objectives add spice enough to the gameplay to make sure you're staying on your toes.  

[05-08-09]: Old Rating: 8.  New rating: 7.5.  I usually want to play something else.  When I'm playing this, though, that's mystifying, because it's so much fun.

Better than I thought it'd be.  Actually a pretty fast paced combat game that has a more Euro-style scoring system.  Sure there's dice rolls, and you can really get screwed by bad rolls, but overall your choices really do give you an edge.

First Impression: 
A highly competitive light wargame with lots of choices and some great mechanics. It also plays in 90m.
Varying units, capture the hill, tight resources, hidden objectives... all in one package.

Neon colors are strange and childish, the units are equally ridiculous, mission objectives are too luck-dependant, but the core is exactly my type of game. I'd like to see this implemented with a good theme / different components.

I'd like to get some more plays of this.  I like the way the rules encourage lots of battles (as opposed to a defensive stance), which should keep the action lively.  The goal of getting victory points for various objectives rather than trying to achieve an overall military victory is also clever and means that each player will develop his own strategy during the each game to fit the mission cards.  There can't be a single "killer" strategy that always wins because your objectives will always be different.  Of course, controlling the monolith never hurts.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
If you like the idea of giant alien bugs smashing each other while racing to the centre of the map in order to fufill arbitrary objectives, then this game is for you. If you would like a thoughtful experience, don't bother. Otherwise, enjoy!

RATING: 7
Hack em, wack em, that rewards agression.   Its more of a royal rumble, than a war game.  I might just be saying that, however, because I was thrown over the top rope in the first few rounds. It does what it sets out to do quickly and in an enjoyable manner.  Once in awhile if someone is clamoring for it, I'd play.  No real fire to suggest it.  Heavy luck factor, but it plays so quickly its okay.

I bought this during the recent Toys 'R Us sale (http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/125743).  It seems very different from the rest of my collection and the type of games I normally go for, which is part of the appeal.  I hope this forray into branching out goes well.

Tried this for the first time and really enjoyed it.  We played 2 vs. 2 teams, which seemed to work really well.  It's a fun little fighting game (not really a wargame I guess) that actually encourage and rewards being aggressive, but doesn't require elimination since you play for victory points.  The components are unique and certainly add the spirit of the game, which makes it a light-hearted romp and a good time.

It's a damned shame that Hasbro killed off most of the Avalon Hill catalog right as this was coming out.  It's a lot of fun and is a better Risk than Risk.  BTW, replacing the money chits with red acrylic gems for rubium is a must.

RATING: 9
Fast paced and fun Risk variant that makes the important change of rewarding attacking and ending the turtling problem forever. It is awfully swingy though with tons of random variables that add up to make things even more random. Still, I can't deny it is fun to play and good strategy has a decent impact on the game too.

Fun Cards That Do Stuff and really cool pieces make this a very enjoyable experience. It's pretty good with 2 and great with 3, but completely awesome as a team game. You have to attack, but you can't completely neglect defense.  You constantly have to adapt, to weigh options: monolith or no? hang back, advance? spread out for quick points or concentrate so that the opponent has a tougher time getting through? There's a constant flow of tension and strategy. One of my favorite games, definitely my favorite 2-on-2 game.

Nice light wargame, with plenty of motivation for people to get out onto the board and mix it up.  Seems like a good mix of open information allowing coalitions to keep things close, and secret goals allowing players to break through despite this balancing factor.

A little fiddly. Monolith and rubium ore deserve better production value.

I realise that there is a fair bit of luck involved in this game, such as the exploration counters near your home base, the mission cards and (of course) the dice rolls. Still, it is short enough to be able to overlook this and, for now,  rather enjoyable.

Nexus Ops is a light-medium science fiction war game. The game boasts a hexagonal board that is dealt differently every time, as well as (in the Avalon Hill edition) cool "glow" miniatures and lots of combat. Players control competing futuristic corporations that battle each other for control of the moon's Rubium Ore. By winning battles and fulfilling Secret Missions, you can obtain victory points.

Units are composed of various alien races and have stats not unlike those used in the Axis & Allies series. Combat is also performed in a similar way. Players who lose battles are compensated with Energize cards which grant them special powers later. Players can also obtain Energize cards by controlling the Monolith, a raised structure in the center of the grid. First person to reach the required number of victory points wins the game.

RATING: 2.5
*This* is a well-themed game???  The terrains offer some of the most boring and pasted on effects I've seen in a long time...

But, hey, we're mercenaries, right?  Do we ever do things in the game like make contracts with different employers to gain different things?  Nope.  As far as I can tell, the fact that we're mercenaries is totally irrelevant to the game play; it's just pasted-on flavor text.

Ok, so our goal is to get these crystals that power weapons.  Do we ever do any mining?  Do we set up mines and have to divide our troops between taking over a new sector and protecting the minors over there?  Nope.

Ok, so these crystals that power weapons, can we use them -- losing VPs since we won't be delivering them to our Corporation masters -- to boost our military during combat?  That could have been a potentially interesting game decision, blowing up VPs here in hopes of gains there.

Nope, not an option.  Guess that these crystals have to be cut or polished or something before being used... Not that this oh-so-thematic setting is ever explained to us.

This is why I don't take Ameritrash criticism seriously.  The ATers simply don't apply their own standards to their own games.  Apparently, if you supply glow-in-the-dark miniatures, a game automatically drips with theme and no one is allowed to question whether it is, in fact, pasted on.

All that being said, the gameplay in Nexus Ops isn't that bad; just mediocre in a fairly bland way, in part because the units are not differentiated enough to make your force composition decisions interesting.

The cards add some options but are a bit too powerful.  As in most fixed length conquest games, you want to enter the final round in second or third place and encourage the others to gang up on the leader.  The best way to sandbag here is to acquire cards and not spend them until the final round. A smaller hand limit would have discouraged this.

Meh.

This is exactly what a light-medium war game I have been looking for which is almost absent from Euroames. The plastic figures are all of good production quality. The combat resolution priority and hit value distribution are all good elements to make it a risk-management, and less a luck-driven game. The secret mission cards are good motives to win the game rather than traditional player elimination. The one red-secret-mission-card limit per victory combat is clever. No obvious flaws is found from this game at its intented scale. The game is also very well positioned as a new blend between Risk and Axis-and-Allies. It captures most good elements from both games, but avoid the bad elements wisely.

Love this game. It has the complexity of pieces Axis and Allies had but a much shorter game time and the setup is less stale.

Nice game if you are looking for a quick fix in the wargame category, because it sure is quick to play and simple to explain. And in my collection, there are not many contestants in this area. Because of its fast play, however, I personally do not find it very engrossing --- it is more of a nice diversion while socializing with friends. The miniatures are very nice, the artwork on the board hex tiles and counters is horrid.

What can I say?  I liked the dayglo aliens...  People were saying good things about the game, and I really don't have many conflict games, so I justified a purchase without having played it.  Fortunately, now that I have played it with 3 players, I can say I liked it quite a bit.  Sure, it isn't the most original game in the books, but it it borrows well.  The mechanics work together very nicely.  For example, I was impressed how the humans, who appear to be the weakest unit in the game, are actually a vital resource.

First Edition. Oh boy this is fun - tactical skirmish game with a little resource collection, secret mission cards and great bits!! The rules are nice and simple but the gameplay offers real depth.  I ignored this originally but was swayed by the comments here into buying it. I'm so glad I did!

RATING: 7.5
On my second play of this game, I didn't manage to eke out a *single point*.  This was attributable to a perfect storm of poor starting position, poor tactics, and poor dice rolling.  (My previous game, I won.)  On one hand, this has me slightly wary of the obviously too-high luck factor.  On the other hand, it has me itching for a rematch.

I'm not sure if I want to rate this a 9 or a 5.  Let's split the difference, then.

Update: Played again, and the third time was the best and closest game yet.  Up to an 8, and likely to stay there for the forseeable future.  (Well, now down to a 7.5 as I seem to be in a mood to downgrade a whole bunch of lighter games.  But it's still one of the best light games out there.)

RATING: 6
Best of the light wargames that I've played.  This is Ameritrash and Risk done right!

Pros:
* Excellent tension
* Full Risk experience in a much shorter timeframe
* Excellent balancing mechanism
* Hidden Mission cards make it hard to determine the leader so less ganging up on the leader.  All players also feel like they have a chance of winning which both enhances tension and also keeps all players interested in the game
* Excellent and varied choice of units
* Excellent hidden combat modifiers in the Energize cards (enhancing tension)
* Rules are quick and easy enough to teach to board game novices
* No player elimination
* Excellent pieces and production (except the monolith)
* Variable board
* Cheap (when in print)
* Scales well with 2-4 players (although 2 is the weakest of the bunch but still worth playing)

Cons:
* Still down to luck with the dice as any game of this category is but I think it's well mitigated and the best of this bunch.  The game is also short enough that it's easy enough to play a 2nd game to redeem a bad run.
* The monolith is not of the same quality standard as the rest of the game which is disappointing as it's the centre piece
* The exploration tile distribution can sometimes give a huge advantage to one player (e.g. if they get all the Rock Spiders allowing early and uncontested Monolith domination).

Conclusion:
If you can find it for sale at a reasonable price I have no hesitation recommending it.  I'm not a huge Ameritrash fan but I still really enjoy this game and it's worth having in my collection to play with those who are Ameritrash fans, new gamers, and even occasionally with a crew that is almost entirely Euro oriented.

Second outing was a team game. I thought it was a good way to play: you can pass cards to your partner for best advantage, you can play cards yourself on your turn that can aid your partner, and it keeps you more interested in the far corner of the board than if it was merely occupied by the enemy-of-my-enemy.

It's everything I think Risk 2210 wanted to be (it may be more accurate to say it was everything _I_ wanted Risk 2210 to be): a quicker, more dynamic, fun version of the classic dice-fest. Most importantly (IMO), Nexus Ops solves Risk's biggest flaw -- it those who sit on the sidelines while punishing those who do the heavy lifting (if A attacks B, C has the advantage) -- in that it rewards aggressiveness (you only earn VPs by winning battles).

For being a fairly simple skirmish game, I'm amazed how fresh this feels.  The bits are fantastic.  I went all out and purchased a blacklight for this game, and the experience was well worth the extra money.  The gameplay is quick but contains a lot of strategy, and the best part?  No turtling!  Winning battles gets you victory points, and even losing battles often turns can be a good thing for you as you get the energize cards.  The combat may be like [gameid=10093], but the strategy feels quite different.  This game is more about winning lots of small skirmishes, rather than building up your forces for a key battle.  Snatch it up while you still can.

This is not a game for euro-snoots or grognards. It has issues like player turn order balance and vis-a-vis trading of points. For what it is however (a short 4x game) it works. Not entirely my cup of tea but I'd play it again and probably still manage to have fun if someone brought it out.

Is this a wargame, or is it too light?  I can't tell.  But it's pretty fun, and it moves along pretty quickly.  The board can get a bit busy, and it's too easy for one person to get a run on victory simply by drawing the right victory cards at the right time, but the game is short enough to keep that from being a big problem.

Nexus Ops is a light-medium science fiction war game. The game boasts a hexagonal board that is dealt differently every time, as well as cool "glow" miniatures and lots of combat. Players control competing futuristic corporations that battle each other for control of the moon's Rubium Ore. By winning battles and fulfilling Secret Missions, you can obtain victory points.
\13\\13\
Units are composed of various alien races and have stats not unlike those used in the Axis & Allies series. Combat is also performed in a similar way. Players who lose battles are compensated with Energize cards which grant them special powers later. Players can also obtain Energize cards by controlling the Monolith, a raised structure in the center of the grid. First person to reach the required number of victory points wins the game.

RATING: 7
This is essentially a distilled Risk game. It does pretty much everything right for a simple conquest game...rewarding aggression, discouraging turtling and wrapping the whole thing up in an hour or so. It also has some VERY cool neon plastic miniatures that look really awesome under a black light.

Another of the "new" Avalon Hill games...and a very good one.

RATING: 7
Like it. Unfortunately, I suck at it. Probably deserves an 8 or more.

Fast game. Don't go for a "build up an empire before I battle", you'll lose for sure. Not that great replayability, but for those precious first times, it is well worth it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I couldn't shake the feeling that the random bits (mostly how well each roll goes and which cards you draw) are a much greater predictor of your success than any strategy you might try. There are a lot of things I like about it, but I don't think there are enough rolls for the luck to balance over time (staring at snake eyes with your dragons and watching fungi eliminate them is extremely irritating). Still, it does play quickly, and it's one of the most immersive games I've played relative to its length; tonight I played a 90 minute game that felt like a 3 hour one in a (mostly) good way.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Great game to have if for no other reason due to the fantastic neon plastic game pieces! But it plays great, too, and I love the fact it has tiles which changes the board every game. It is a good war game which appeals even to Eurogamers. 

But play with more aggression than you normally do in a game, or your opponents will steal the game from you before you know it!

Nexus Ops surprised me in my first play. It's quick to learn, fast to play, and lots of interactive fun. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The game play is pretty simple, but the strategy is fairly complex. Combat works similar to Axis and Allies, but there is only one round of combat as opposed to fighting until one side is dead. Possession of the monolith in the center is key to winning future battles. Mine placement is random, and the position of the two income mines is important. Having them near you is a mixed blessing, because it may cause both of your neighbors to concentrate efforts on you.Overall, this is a very good and well designed game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A light thematic war game where players win by accomplishing a series of secret missions (which almost always involve winning battles). It has an economic component, where the more mines you control the more money you make. Different units have different powers, with Energize cards giving bonuses in various ways.

This game is flat out awesome.  The thing that makes it work so much better than related games is that it absolutely forces you to be aggressive.  Turtlers will stand no chance, and it'll probably even be in your best interest to over-extend sometimes in the name of VP.

The mission system works better here than in any other game I've played.  The units are impeccably balanced and have interesting and relevant special abilities.  Energize cards that at first seem underpowered later reveal themselves to be super-potent in the right combo and situation.

It really is a shame there's almost no chance at expansions for this game (assumption based on the closeout prices it was available for everywhere when I bought it), because it's a great, great system.  Still, as a one-off game, it is the perfect fast, strategic, light wargame, and I suspect I'll be playing it for a long time.

[A huge thank you to George Murray.  I was missing a yellow rock strider and he generously sent me a replacement.  My favorite game is no longer incomplete!]

I even enjoy the dice combat system in this game.

OK, I finally threw in the towel, got on the bandwagon, and stopped paddling upstream on this one.  Despite the translucent colors which I abhor, this is no doubt a simple and fun game that I'd probably play over standard Risk any day of the week.  Pure Ameritrash but probably should be in every collection that has Monopoly just so you can play a good game instead.

RATING: 8
A fun, quick-paced science fiction skirmish. Quick and easy to learn and play. While combat is central and rewarding, you actually win by completing secret missions, which adds a nice bit of tension. Also, did I mention the space dragons?

The two editions available differ primarily in components. I own the original 2005 Avalon Hill edition which basically look like the most ridiculous 1990s space cartoon cliche ever. And apparently the minis glow in UV light. It's all a matter of taste really, but if this description appeals as much to you as it does to me, then I recommend trying to score the Avalon Hill edition while it's available. The newer edition has rules variants, but the rulebook is available online and is compatible with the original edition.

RATING: 7
Fun game, it firmly fills out the part of my collection that would include Risk if I could stand it.  Good light game that plays very quickly, and one that non-gamers might like.  Not hugely deep and has some randomness, but it plays in an hour, so no worries on that front.  Rated upwards 1 point, this game is very good.  For maximum fun, play with 4 players.

RATING: 8.5
So, when someone asks for the nickel-tour on Nexus Ops, I tell them: "It's like a microcosm of Risk that takes 60-90 minutes and has secret objectives."

It's my go-to replacement for that Risk-like, dudes-on-a-map experience, partly because it's so compact and so quick but also because it accommodates 2, 3 or 4 players with the same level of excellence and comes boxed with a multitude of ways to play.

There's nothing spectacularly original in it's fundamentals. You collect resources, buy various units (each with their own special abilities) and march them across the board to conquer your opponents. But it's the way that the game is executed that just cuts right to the fun. The map is small and the game forces conflict early. You want to conquer enemy troops for victory points and control key areas for extra resources and special cards.

And the special cards are one of the clever little things about the battle system here. See, if the attacker wins a battle, he can claim a victory point (first to 12 wins). But the loser gets to draw a card from a special deck. So losing a few battles just means you'll have an extra edge when it comes your turn to get back into the game.

You can also gain victory points for fulfilling special conditions outside of combat. And here's the cool part, this is based on which victory cards you've drawn and nobody knows what you might be holding onto. The result is that every player is constantly striking out to capture those points and it creates a chaotic brawl of army on army and players' control of the board ebbs and flows.

All of this in an easy-to-teach, 75-minute game that is full of constant battles and surprising twists and turns. Easily Top 10 material for me.

It is pretty good.  However, between 2 equal players, the first player will win.  My brother and I are both experienced gamers, but I usually beat him in games (I am the older brother).  We opened this and learned together.  We played 11 games the first weekend, rolling the die each time to see who went first.  He went first 9 times, and won those 9 games.  I went first twice, and won both of those.  I played it multiplayer once, and won with only one of my home territories left.  It was nice to be able to win via VP without having to conquer everyone, but it felt kind of wrong to have a couple of guys left after my base was razed and be able to get the win.  It was a little too gamey for me.  The pieces were well made and pretty cool, but the game was just a touch off for me.

I like this game overall. Don't get tricked into building up a massive force then trying to take the lead! Almost everyone has a shot at winning due to the victory conditions. I do wish I could find a variant that made the starting areas a little better, sometimes it feels a little unbalanced. It plays fast enough that it's not such a big deal. It's really the best at what it attempts to do. (Be a short, light, wargame.)

I am not a big war-gamer, but this is light enough to keep my interest without keeping me stressed out for the entire 60+ minutes (don't let them kid you about the time estimation).  I feel like the game is mostly balanced in that the corporations are all identical (ie. no special skills), and losers of battles get consolation prizes. However, the controller of the "Monolith" or center square of the board, gets a ridiculous advantage over the other player. Maybe that evens out with > 2 players.

It was a bit tedious by the end, and I have some concerns about the game replay-ability, but overall I enjoyed myself quite a bit.

Sci-fi, but not like Battlestar Galactica.  Think Galaxy Trucker or RoboRally, or Firefly for TV sci-fi.  Wargame, but wacky and light-hearted.  In our group, it will be compared to Dust because these are the only two wargames we've played.  Dust is the superior wargame, but Nexus Ops isn't trying to be serious like that.  Dust is gritty and dark - in contrast Nexus Ops is actually flourescent!  Nexus Ops is just as good as what it is, as Dust is at what it is.  Maybe a tad better, hence the slightly higer rating.

This is totally a juvenile guy game.  It sports sci-fi monsters, battles and such.  The bits are cool.  It is a mildly fussy game with a variety of things to remember.

It is not about wiping the other guy out.  It is a little long but reasonably fun anyway.

Player elimination doesn't seem like it will be that frequent of an occurence so completing missions seems to be the best way to win.  Thus, I wonder if the randomness of the conditions will sometimes give one player the victory even if their play wasn't superior.  The game is over quick enough that I'm not sure that will be a problem.  That being said I'm sure that better play will win more often.

I'd rate this higher, but my friends don't like it as much as I do, so I'll never buy it.

UPDATE: My rating has decreased from a 7 to a 6. After our last play, I'm seeing what my friends see as problems with the game.

It all boils down to one thing, I think: The game is so well balanced, that nothing really matters in terms of decision making. Now while this turned me on to the game at first (and I've heard and read from reviewers that this is their reason for loving the game), the fairness of everything means that everyone is basically in the game. It all comes down to what Secret Mission cards you draw.

Oh well. Glad I didn't buy it because it's too expensive for a "fair and modern" risk and axis and allies.

Awesome game were you fight to gain victory points. Little time for turtling as you get points for being aggressive. I also like that it has hidden quests. Equally great for 2,3 and 4 players. Pretty simple game and not wearing out its welcome. If you don't mind dice this is a fantastic choice if you need a game were armies go head to head. A big hit in our gaming group.

This is a cool dudes-on-a-map game that really nails it. Pretty much the only way to get VPs is to be aggressive and turtling is not rewarding at all. The random distribution of hexes and exploration tiles add some variability without going over the top too. I like how the different units have perks that suit them thematically as well. Has to be one of the best direct conflict games.

Not impressed with the FFG copy. The hexes look like cheap Windows 98 backgrounds with photos of toys for factories. The exploration counters are cluttered, we actually missed the reinforcements on the factory tiles. The energize cards look nice and the secret mission/battle VP cards are okay. The minis are obviously the best part.

Sold my copy. Group has it anyway and now being reprinted.

Battle game with streamlined rules that are easy to pick up and victory is not based on player elimination but instead is based on points gained through battles and achieving various special objectives. Combine that with a modular board that changes every game and an exploration phase of the game and you have a winner. Great game. My only complaint is that we will not see any expansions for this system - would love to see an expansion with new terrain, units, objectives, and energizer cards. A damned shame.

Millennia later, the socialist pre-industrial civilization of Catan has evolved to a cycle of mass-homicidal corporatist exploitation of limited resources in space.

...Upgrading steadily.  First few plays I thought it was quality fun.  Several more I find myself wondering about strategy and whether the game design isn't perfect...

Also, my son's favourite game.  Which makes it a practical "9.5".

...[a year or so later] I believe this game is indeed practically perfect.  If you're looking for:

1) Territory control
2) Point-to-point movement
3) Heavy combat with simple but statistically rational mechanics
4) Less than 1 hour play

I can't imagine anything more effective.  This is the true spiritual heir to chess.

...Another year and another 1/2 point up in rating. "8.5" is my rating for Xiang Qi, and I'm a classicist, so this is hard for me to confess.  It's obviously in a different class of game than Xiang Qi, but it's not right to prevent affinity to that integer just because it's not 1,200 years old.  Nexus Ops is a truly great board game.

AP prone, attack the leader type of game. Theme and scoring does not seem to gel very well, e.g. one could end up with a very weak army but as long as you reach 12 VPs, you win.

RATING: 7
A colorful explosion of oddly shaped and oddly smelling pieces. I'm not enough of a gamer to properly shine a light on any of its "Euro" elements, although there's a bit of random resource exploring (ala Catan), mixed with old fashioned monster on human dice fests. Explore, earn money, buy forces, march them forward, fight for territory, repeat. Oddly enough, the winner isn't who has the most money, it's (mostly) who wins battles, which occur kind of like Axis and Allies (the defender decides who gets hit) with a "big guys shoot first" theme. The random board setup keeps it fresh, as does the random layout of what's actually found on the spaces. I suppose an experienced player has an advantage since they know what Missions are in the deck, but since most mission are battle based, you'd do best to just try not to lose any. An odd, strangely refreshing game.

First impressions are quite favorable, and the first playing was a big hit. 4 player game took just about an hour, and while luck-heavy, there's a lot of action. Good mix of luck, expansion and combat. Awarding VPs for winning combat and Energize cards for losing combat keeps the pace brisk, and prevents turtling. Interesting blend of game elements, and nice production quality.

We played this with 2 people so it was a bit difficult to judge.  I controlled the monolith early in the game and it was never contested.  I got too overpowered to the point that my wife flipped our table.  It was fun for me and I love the strategy involved.  Use your humans as decoys!  I see this game being very good with 3 or 4 people.

Pretty decent light wargame.  Though it's nice that each turn you get another secret potential source of victory points, since you draw them randomly, they may all be infeasible for your situation in the game.  Perhaps what I most appreciate about this game is that it is a streamlining of this sort of game, yet with a modular map to keep things varied from game to game.

Purchased this from KB Toys for 10.39 w/free shipping!  Thanks to whoever posted that deal.  My wife wouldn't have consented otherwise.  I am hoping it takes the place of Risk.

We played for the first time the day we got it and she walloped me. (12-4) Sheesh!  That is, of course, a good thing since she will play in the future.  She only threw the dice at me once.

Originally, we got this to serve as an alternative to Risk.  It think it would have worked, but we hardly ever played it.

Great 'light' conflict game, with gorgeous bits and interesting unit powers.  Plays so quickly and is so engaging that even the last-place player in one game will often want to play another immediately after.

Upgraded to a 9 after further plays resolved and refined the problems with whom to attack, and when.

Never as a four-player game, play as teams of two.  Left-right binding is too high for 4p individually...beside the 'pass your teammate a card' rule is fun, and adds a level of strategy.

Played once. It plays a lot quicker than I thought. Initially it seemed that we'd never get to 10 points (we decided on the shorter game since we didn't have that much time), but in the end the point totals were 7, 9, 10. The secret missions really help speeding things up, and the points just come flying in. Very recommended.

Edit: Played some more. Still a neat game!

Very cool. Light and great fun. The components are unique and the game seems to play well with any number of players. It is a nuanced balance between clean, Euro-ish design and chaotic/unexpected card play and dice rolling. This makes a game like Risk obselete for me. I usually play to only 10 points (as opposed to the recommended 12) to keep the end from dragging on.

Nexus Ops is a clever game that uses the same sort of combat system as Axis & Allies (that is, money is collected each round to buy new units, and each unit rolls a die and scores a hit based on its effectiveness).  What's clever about it is that you win by winning battles, not by gaining territory or otherwise capturing an enemy capital.  What this means is that even someone who is "losing" in regards to raw troop strength and income can still win, which makes Nexus Ops exempt from "turtling" and momentum-based end-games because even someone who is not doing very well still has chances to score points.  The process whereby the loser of a battle gains an Energize card, which will give him some kind of bonus in the future, also helps to keep losing players in the game.  I don't see Nexus Ops ever reaching classic-status, but it's fun and solves a lot of the problems inherent in other games of its genre.  I've only played the 2 player game, and I expect the 4 player game to really improve the experience.

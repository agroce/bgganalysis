Well, now I can say I've played a game of Fluxx.  It went about as expected, which is to say rather boring.  It's a very light, very chaotic and random game.  Might be a decent party game for non-gamers, but gamers should probably not bother.

You can have some fun with this game? Yes, and probably you will laught, but of course it depends more on the players than on the game, that is fun in the begining but gets boring because it is too random and it's unpredictable ending condition makes the game with an unpredictable duration.

Looks Daunting at first but really is an easy game to play and learn. A lot of randomness, but fun to play with a group of non gamers. Can be quick or a little longer just all depends on how the rules fall. I like how at any time someone can just add in, so we often use this as a warm up game or a lunch hour game at work. 
Have played Star Fluxx and Firefly version. Firefly I love the theme and the keepers don't have as many abilities as they do in the Star version. Sometimes feel there are just a few too many and a little over kill in that game.

I know this game does not get a lot of love from hardcore gamers but that doesn't mean it isn't fun.  This is a reactive game -- throw strategy out the window -- that you play to laugh and relax.  You take what comes and make the best out of it.  

I will say that the added "complexity" of this version compared to other Fluxx games makes it better in the longevity department.  Playing regular Fluxx (or the other thematic versions) is relatively boring in comparison.  And lastly, if you like sci-fi, you will absolutely love all the references.

This still makes it out regularly even if for only one game.

Good for laughs.  Tough to strategize but fun to try and then frustrating when your strategy gets tossed out with a single card!  Gotta take this one for what it is, a light hearted social game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
There's something attractive about a game that can be taught while it's played. Fluxx games accomplish this by supplying cards that new players can't stop looking at and rules that are so easy, you'll question whether it's a game to begin with. 

That being said, after a dozen plays and seeing all the cards, the replayability will wane. You'll learn to make decisions that increase your probability of winning amidst the random chaos. Thus, the game will become less of a question of "How to win?" and more, "How do you not lose?"

Oh, the answer is fluxx. Perhaps, the price offsets the fluxx.

RATING: 7
Hands-down the best version of Fluxx.  Still subject to randomness and chaos (particularly at higher player counts), but the theme and additional complexity make this one a "keeper." (See what I did there, Fluxx players?)

I actually think the game is best with two players, since this makes it a more strategic experience.  With two players, the game feels like life -- you can and should make strategic plans, but something beyond your control is likely going to come along and throw a wrench in them.  How capable you are of anticipating and mitigating the uncertainty while keeping your plans flexible is the key to success.

At higher player counts however, the game can just feel hopeless.  So much is spinning out of your control that you can lose even the illusion that you are meaningfully shaping your own destiny.  This is a major negative.  Games are about choices and a player has to feel like their choices matter.

Ez egy őrült kártyajáték, de sci fi rajongóknak kötelező. A szabályok változnak, a cél változik, a nálad lévő dolgok változnak, néha még helyet is kell cserélni egy másik játékossal, átadva egymásnak a pozíciókat (vesztettem már el így játékot az utolsó körben). Nem igazán lehet tudni, hogy milyen hosszú lesz-egy játék: volt már, hogy 5 perc alatt vége lett, volt, hogy egy órán át húzódott. Levezetőnek gyakran előkerül - ha a társaság már ismeri a kártyákat és nem áll le állandóan a játék a szövegek értelmezése miatt, az időkeretet is jobban be lehet lőni.

A very fun, silly concept filler game, that becomes significantly less fun with the amount of reading, rule explaining and updating, and general lack of interesting things happening.

Great card game, with completely different style of play and rules than you will be used too.  There are many types of Fluxx games available, but when I saw Star Fluxx, I didn't even consider buying any of the others (OK, maybe the Monty Python, but I think the non-trademark style of the cards makes Star Fluxx so fun and hilarious).  This was my first time playing Fluxx and I didn't have any problems understanding the rules, but I do find myself forgetting some of my keeper powers, but thats just the fun of playing, knowing you may have been able to win last round if you had done x, y, or z.  Of course, since there are many pathways to victory, there are also many pathways to have victory snatched from you, completely unrelated to your own stupidity.  Most Star Fluxx games for us become a battle of attrition, to see how long you can play before someone gets lucky enough to have the right keepers, without anyone being able to foil their victory.

I enjoy almost everything about this game.  I love the references to sci fi movies and tv.  I love the art. I love the very unique Fluxx-style gameplay, where the rules themselves are constantly changing.

I question the 10 minute playing time, though.  The game can literally be over on the 2nd turn or last 3 hours because the winning conditions are constantly changing.  If you don't own any Fluxx game, I recommend you pick one up.  They're small and cheap and therefore a good travel or camping game.  I haven't tried them all, but Star Fluxx is easily my favorite of those I have.  Still, there's a wide variety of them, so take a look and pick a theme you'll like.

Marginally better than the original in that the keepers have powers which you can then chooser whether to use or not, giving you a modicum of control over proceedings. The theme is also more coherent (or rather is it just that the original is so disparate as to be themeless?), and will raise a few laughs if you're a sci-fi buff. But at its heart it's still Fluxx.

RATING: 6
This game is completly random, usually your plans go out the window because of the everchanging rules. Sometimes the game is over in the first turn and sometimes play takes an hour. This randomness is what makes the game fun. Also the theme in Star Fluxx is great.

The best part about this game (besides all the fun sci-fi references) is how quickly it can end.... Or not! I work 24hr shifts and it's very easy to set up and pause in the middle if we get a call. Simple rules allow for non-gamers to jump right in and it's become somewhat of a tradition at our station to play now! Plus, it's a cheap game with tons of replayability. We have found the game works best with 3-4 players tops.

We enjoy the Fluxx games, and this one was a lot of fun. It was the first Fluxx we played that we actually included the special abilities/cards for the theme. It definitely adds a lot to the game and makes each one seem more unique.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Does Fluxx need to be made more complicated by adding special abilities to almost all of the Keepers? I didn't think so, but apparently there's a place for that in Star Fluxx. Games run slower than other Fluxx games because players are often stuck reading and re-reading the abilities of their Keepers, not to mention trying to hoard as many crew member cards as they can with the Captain. Honestly, the game would have worked very well with the Creepers that stick to other cards, a couple of Keepers that fix that (by removing the Creepers or removing both cards), and the Holographic Projection. Everything else just bogs down the game.

At least overcomplication is in theme, though.

It's easy to get newcomers to the table with this game, but after a few plays the humor begins to wear off and you're left with a decent but not particularly entertaining beer and pretzels game.

Creepers are the worst in the best possible way. This game doesn't have a lot of rules initially, but you do have to pay attention or you will quickly lose track of what is going on and may just let your chance of winning slip by you. The nods to our favorite sci-fi shows and novels makes this a favorite in our house.

Our favorite version of Fluxx. Good creepers, good keepers, fun additional actions. This version seems to play the most smoothly of all the versions we own (we own, Cthulhu, Monty Python, Firefly, Martian, and Original Fluxx as well). A fast fun silly game that is super easy to teach. Plays in 5-30 minutes. Best with 2-4 players, more than that and games are too short with 1 deck and too long with 2 decks combined.

Andrew Looney up to old (& new) tricks with yet another Fluxx version.

For new encounters (close or passing), there are some laughs here as one becomes acquainted with the cards and in-jokes of the set.

But in the end this is still Fluxx, and Creepers and Surprises aside, it can end randomly, sometimes painfully long or prematurely terminated.

Good for a crowd not too interested in deep play, and for those who want some illusion of control stick to two player, head-to-head games.

The best of the Fluxx series that I've played. Sometimes you win a lot. Sometimes you lose a lot. Its really about how much of it feels controllable. By yourself, its absolutely manageable. Oh but this is a game with others. How foolish to expect any outcome at all. Well at some point you'll draw a correlation between who you play with and how much you enjoy the game. You might not like the results, but therein lies the most important choice you'll ever make in this game: who you play with.

This game created some laughs in our group, but it didn't feel much like playing a game. I know it's the point of fluxx (to be in fluxx), but without being able to even minimally strategize it sort of just felt like we were distracting ourselves.

I did love the nerd service with all of the references though.

RATING: 1.5
MY rating is mostly for the fact that I hate this game, and it's not fun whatsoever. I do not understand the love that all the versions of this game receive. I'm sorry, but this is the epitome of a non-game. It can end in less than the time it takes to shuffle the cards, or as long as Twilight Imperium 4. And for a silly card game, that is preposterous. It's all luck. No strategy no tactics, it's up there with Phase 10 and UNO. There are not many games out there that I will straight up refuse to play if someone asks me, but this is one of them. 

Both times I played, which will be the final times, I tried my best to give someone else a victory just so the pain would end. One game, we didn't even finish! and we had been playing for more than an hour! People that like this game either have never played any of the plethora of simple card games out there, or have only played exploding kittens and Cards against Humanity. This game sucks, and I Hate it with the force of ten exploding suns.

I added a .5 to the score for the nods at geeky tropes in the card art. Woo-hoo this game is literally a 0 out of ten

Star Fluxx is one of the better Flux variants - the main draw here is the Keeper cards, many of which allow players to steal certain Keepers or discard or detach Creepers.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Got to be in the mood for chaotic fun on this one.  Really about manipulating the rules to get you closer to the win, but denying other people the victory by changing goals.  Not a lot of strategy, because it will boil down to getting the right card combo at the end.

Just about crazy fun, no deep thinking, just pay attention to your cards.  

The theme is fun if you're a sci-fi geek and have watched all the major sci-fi films and shows, so you'll get the "in-jokes".

I haven't played all the fluxx games, but the creepers are a nice way to mix things up.

I played Fluxx with my kids a ton when it first came out. Later I was intrigued by the thematic versions and thought these would be more fun given thematic cards, but the same game play. What I discovered is that the themes make the cards more interesting, but the additional mechanics and card powers make it more random, longer, more mean, etc. They just accentuate the characteristics that become criticisms once they overtake the experience. I will still play Fluxx if asked, (which my daughter will do occasionally) but please make it the simple, usually quick, original.

At this point I have played Star Fluxx close to 10 times. Right off the bat this would have been an 8-9 for me.  I had so much fun with this game, but I think after so many plays I am starting to see the cracks.  My first few sessions lasted about 30-45 minutes in long drawn out matches with many close call victories, but the last three games were all done by the second turn five minutes tops. The first time we had a sub five minute game we all thought it was crazy and lucky, but then 2 more right aftwards left a bad taste in my month.  I feel like a game shouldnt take longer to hand out than to win.  Maybe we were lucky/unlucky depending on your point of view.

RATING: 3
Star Fluxx is probably my favorite Fluxx game, but I am not a fan of any of them, in general. The appeal ought to come from the random/wacky/ever-changing nature of play, but I find that the light elements of apparent strategy or tactics prime my mind to expect more control over what goes on, making me less able to appreciate the simple fun of chaos. For that alone, I don't find that it has the best balance of choice and chance, and I can't quite take it on its own terms.

It can make for a decent warm-up with people who are not as big a fan of heavier games, though, and I will not say no to it if something else is likely to come up afterwards.

Most of the games on my list, if I rag on one aspect, it's luck. This game is pretty much all about luck, everything changes from turn to turn. The only way to do any sort of strategy is by using effectively a card that lets you play multiple cards and having a good hand draw selection. It happens fairly frequently, and most games seem to be won this way, but theme and speed of play just make this enjoyable for me, and it's anybody's game at any point whatsoever. So yeah, this is probably the only time I'd cheerfully play a game that has such a strong luck aspect.

This was my first Fluxx game and it started a new fullgrown addiction. :-)

I love Fluxx and I love this Fluxx.  

You can take it anywhere with you.  The gameplay remains interesting after many games.   This theme (star) has nice art, many winks to known scifi franchises and still allows you to build some strategy.  (some fluxxes are faster and give you no time for strategy building)

Also, this game is also fun to play with 2 players.

Type: 2-6 player light card game for small groups

Best With: 3-4 (5 gets long)
Weight: light
Duration: 5-60 minutes
Notes:
Card-based with text and effects on cards; but not intricate
Game length can be quick, or get long.
Planning through large hand sizes can get paralyzing.
Luck based on card-draw, or just finding solutions in card interactions.
Very minor neighbor screwing.
Very little room to strategize unless in a 2-player game.

Star Fluxx is a light card game where each player plays a card in hand, follows what the card says, and attempts to win the game by having the correct combination of keeper cards deployed in front of them. The key schtick for this game, though, is that each card played pretty much changes the rules and win conditions for the game; keep it essentially in flux!

One upside to this game is the simplicity of the game play. It's fun. You can play it without too much thought, and it can be very fun as there is no chance for strategy, and only a little ability to plan tactically.

There are downsides for this game, though they really can be outweight by how fun this game can be. First, sometimes the game will last a mere 5 minutes. Other times, it can last an hour and really drag on. Second, I'm not a fan at all of just one single card in the game (Brain Transference) where you physically trade seats with another player, taking their cards and position on the table. This is annoying to uproot people, especially if they're wanting to sit where they are for some reason (host is near the door, someone is next to a spouse, etc). Third, there are times where you can amass 12-20 cards in your hand, and maybe even be able to play 5 or even all of them! This can cause some serious slowdowns as one or more players have a lot of cards to read and figure out what they want to do. Hopefully, though, no one takes the game too seriously, and eventually just gets things going and sees how they play out. Lastly, the game isn't all that fun with 2 players, as you basically just bash each other as much as you can and hope you draw the right card at the right time to win.

Despite the several downsides, this game is super fun (I'd personally remove the Brain Transference card) and usually quick and enjoyable with 3-6 players.

RATING: 7.5
Card based game, whose main feature is that the rules are always changing, thanks to an intelligent system based on which cards are played. Having just one strategy planned will help little, because you can't simply plan long term: rules that are in effect now, could change completely come next turn. You win this game by using logic and keeping more than one backup plan at hand, and, even yet, one single act of randomness could wipe every strategy off the table.

To me, this serves the same purpose as Munchkin but for a smaller time frame: a gamified social activity to play with friends who aren't really gamers. I would never play this with anyone from my game group, but for hanging out with friends or a pick-up game at a con I find it enjoyable.

Good: 
Entertaining theme that blends various scifi franchises like start trek, star wars, dr who, etc.

Really easy to teach. 

Bad: 
So much randomness its difficult to actually execute a strategy. 

Because of the random nature games can last anywhere from 10 minutes to over an hour. So it can't reliably be used as a quick filler.

It is Fluxx, so everything changes rapidly. Once you get used to the sheer variability this is a fun game, although a bad run of cards at the start can ruin a game in no time. Only played it a few times, will play some more and then review this score.

Not a bad little filler, gets quite chaotic. The length of the game seems to be a little too variable due to the changing end conditions.

Being a fan of randomness helps a lot for me so I definitely enjoyed playing Star Fluxx. My friend's kids kids enjoyed playing and I can see that non-gamer friends will enjoy it as well as I will be able to teach it within minutes. That is a great point for me as I will use it with non-gamers as some light fun which doesn’t take too long. I do like the changing rules and goals as you do have to stay on your toes and it is also a great equalizer when playing with serious gamers who like to plan things out and look for optimum strategies. Having said that, I think that they are less likely to want to play. I would have liked the theme to have a bit more depth so there was a bit more humor and a bit of a story but this just wouldn’t fit the Fluxx model so like Top Trumps, the theme is pasted onto the core mechanics engine which purrs along nicely. A fun experience with a fun game.

For an easy, brain-friendly family game, Star Fluxx works nicely.

RATING: 5
Interesting the first few times we played, but once you've seen all the cards, the honeymoon is over. The only real strategy for winning is to hold on to an objective and the cards you need to complete them, then wait for a turn where you can play all three. Beyond that it's far too random to string together a coherent strategy or even derive much satisfaction from the system. Still, can be a lot of fun as a filler or opener with the right people (though really, you can say the same thing about many far better games).

The game is ok.  It plays really fast and there is a little bit of cock-blocking.  There always seems to be too many Goal cards.  It also feels too hard to stop someone from winning because there aren't many cards that can counter other cards.  I think Munchkin does everything better.

A fun game if not taken seriously.  I went in with a lower view of Fluxx games due to others, however I found was a little fun.  I liked the homage it did to sci-fi.  It was simple to play.

 It travels well, plays fast, and is the only game I have where a player can leave the table, and the rest of us can continue to play, and when that player comes back they just step back in and are no worse off. (Or I can deal a late comer in. Or someone can bail and the game goes on). 
 I even created my own solo version, it's on the Star Fluxx page.

Fluxx just doesn't seem like my thing. There are moments of fun and group interaction. However, there's a lot of learning and reading for new (and experienced players) and there's an awful lot of luck involved. The game length is also so variable. For a light game, you'd hope it would end fairly quickly (which it can), but it could also end up taking hours too.

Fluxx? The only way to describe the rule changes is by comparing it to being a high school kid playing the drinking game Quarters.

One of the better themed Fluxx games, with some interesting mechanics. If I'm going to play Fluxx, I'd usually prefer this one. Although I do own Math Fluxx now, which I haven't played yet, but I might end up preferring that one.

I like the concept of Fluxx, but it includes some cards that can slow the game down a lot sometimes, and the game can end up lasting a bit too long. I still think it's a clever system and generally enjoy the games I play of it, though.

I got this game for Christmas in 2014, and I don't think that I've gotten the chance to play it with the right group yet. Need to play with a group that is focused on having a good time with a light, fun card game rather than winning at all costs.

6. Ok. Would take it before leaving it.

Fluxx is a party game at heart, and 4-6 shows it off to its best, chaotic silliness. I've combined Star and Pirate.

If I never played again, it certainly wouldn't kill me, but it's a non-offensive silly game to pass the time with non-gamers.

Initial impression: This version feels more cohesive than the original Fluxx with regards to theme, and I think that makes it a bit more replayable, at least for me. If you don't get many New Rules cards out the game can drag on.

I understand this is one of the better Fluxx games. For us, as for so many others, it's a giant meh. The "the rules always change" thing is cute but it's done better in Red 7. Other than that, this game has nothing. Too random, too arbitrary. Some of the cards are mildly amusing.

Finally got around to trying this out. Neat concept but so incredibly random that it was frustrating when you're working on a strategy & it gets yanked out from under you dozens of times. Lots of hesitation from players on their turns while they decide (& read/refresh themselves on) all the options before making a decision.

RATING: 2
I'm going to give Fluxx the benefit of a doubt and assume it's wildly different than Star Fluxx, the only version I have played. Star Fluxx is one of the least entertaining things I've played.

I'd jokingly compare Fluxx "just roll a die, highest roll wins" except that game sounds better.

I have to compare Fluxx to another game I love dearly, 1000 Blank White Cards. 1KBWC also has random, unpredictable rules and a chaotic game, so why does it get a pass? In 1KBWC, you're creating the chaos. You directly control the kind of chaos you're introducing into the game. You decide if it becomes a game about points, about controlling cities, or a game about shouting out the most character names from Star Trek.

If Fluxx were funnier, the chaotic rules would be a joy rather than an annoyance. If it were more predictable, you might be able to play to win. As it is, it's a game I neither find amusing or engaging.

Star Fluxx, I mean. I'm sure Fluxx is different.

This is a game that is all about chaos.  Rules of the game constantly changes.  Goals for winning keep changes.  Through all of this is wrapped up in a sci fi theme.  You will see references to Star Wars, Star Trek and a number of other references from well known sci fi TV's and movies.

This game is more about theme and humour than anything else.  It's a fun filler game that crazy things can happen.

One of the great and not so great things about fluxx is how long it takes. You never know, and if you don't like sci fi, you probably won't enjoy this game. However, I do! It makes fun references to all your nerdy books, movies, etc... The game is crazy, fun, erratic, and there is very little strategy possible except to plan for change. I like it more than a 7/10, but as a game itself, it's not THAT great :)

I think the description, "slightly boring, take it or leave it" fits this game perfectly. I don't really mind playing Star Fluxx; it's not a bad way to wind down after an intense, strategic game. It's nearly all luck and a bit silly, although some of the "fluctuations" can become extremely tedious, such as rule combinations that make your hand unmanageable or keepers that force you to trade cards with your opponent every turn. From what I've seen of the other Fluxx games, there's absolutely no reason to get but just one set with the theme that suits you best. I definitely believe that if you're a sci-fi fan, this theme vastly improves the game--which is not really saying much, but does move it from "boring, hate it" territory to "sometimes fun, good for a laugh".

This was my first time playing any Fluxx game. I know Fluxx doesn't have a very good reputation on BGG so I wasn't expecting much.

The gameplay itself wasn't too bad. There's a simple draw-a-card, play-a-card mechanic, but it gets more interesting as more rules are played by the players. My biggest problem is with the amount of luck of the draw. You're essentially trying to get two different cards in front of you at the right time in order to win the game. The problem is that you have very little control over which cards you get and when. I won the game just because I drew the right card at the right time so even winning didn't feel very satisfying.

I can see the appeal but this isn't for me.

Simple rules (at the beginning at least) and with a great deal of chaotic fun.

The downtime can be a pain though, as you can see the others play "Draw 4, Play 3" or "Play All" and so forth, and in your turn the rules changed so that all you can do is, well, play 1 and pass. For this reason, I found that the 3 players game works a lot better than the 4+.

The box could be a little bigger (so that the cards could be sleeved and still fit in it).

More 'difficult' then the basic fluxx - slows down if taken too seriously since there can be a lot of text and cards to go through

If played until more familiar I think this would be much better then the original - a lot more interaction with the other players

Like its brethren, Star Fluxx is the game of ever changing rules. It starts out as Draw 1, Play 1, but even that can change. When a Goal card is played, you can win by meeting the Goal, usually by having the correct Keeper cards in front of you. Action and Surprise cards help you to meet the Goal, or stop your oppenent. Creeper cards usually prevent you from winning, but are sometimes necessary to meet the Goal.

Its Flux... In... Space.  And no more.  If you like SciFi references there is some fun stuff in here and I liked the keepers with special powers.  The Creepers cancelling the special powers was a nice touch too.  Not sure I'm a big fan of reaction cards in Flux but them being able to be played normally out of your hand for a different effect is clever.  Like any Flux at this point I would never request to play, but if you've got to play Flux this is a fine one.

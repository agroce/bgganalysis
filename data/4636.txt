If you have 15 minutes to spare this will fit the bill. Never played with the full complement of players, and more often than not the 'non-playing colour' wins. Game flaw, or proof of myopic gamers? Your call.

Great game.  Plenty of bluff, strategy and tactics.  A little bit of luck too.  Colourful board, nice art work on the box, quick to play, cheap, easy to teach and as deep as you want it to be.  The hidden sides rule is quite interesting and I like the way the ground that is worthless changes throughout the different eras.  It is lightish, but is different and fun.  For a half hour game, what more can you want?

We should give this a few more tries.  I liked it ok, she thinks that hiding your color feels like the goal, but distracts from best play, which is irritating.  Probably an unusual, but not terribly exciting, mid-range Euro, which means a bit boring in some ways.

First things first: Two players? Really? No. Not in a million years.

Ok game, to be played once in a while. I only played it with four or five players, and it's a bit too chaotic this way. You start with neutral moves to prevent the other players from founding villages and at midgame you suddenly find yourself trying to found as much villages as you can. I think it could with better with two or at most three players. It's quite fast, anyway, so it's usually not boring.

A delightful abstract with a nice touch of theme. The "hidden" clans are really what makes the game. I am somewhat dissatisfied with how short Clans is: I'd probably like it more if it was increased by about 50%. Nevertheless, as it stands, it makes for a very deep filler: a rarity.

Clans let's you move around pawns of different factions (tribes). When all lands around a collection of pawns are empty a new village is formed - its creator gains points as well as all tribes in the village - but sometimes only after a tribal war has killed several colours of pawns. 

What's special about it? You only know who is which color every player represents after the game. During the game each players color remains a secret.

Bright colorful map and pieces, but a little too dry and abstract for me.  I was in a three player game with a computer science professor and the other person had won the national chess championship in high school.  I just sat back and watched smoke pour out of their ears.

An excellent game which you can learn in less than 5 minutes, yet it has such a deep strategy! Excellent as a family game, as a gamer's game and even as a time-filler!

UPDATE: Most people don't get it as easy as I did, wondering what to do next all the time. Even if this doesn't make it a long game, it frustrates people easily. Rating dropped to an 8.

I am admittedly biased towards abtract games. But abstract games that play well with 2, 3 and even 4 players are so rare that I think this deserves heaps of praise. Very colorful board, simple rules, quick play with room for tactics and strategy - what&#039;s not to like. Well, the game is somewhat plagued by the weak-player syndrome (the person playing after the weak player tends to win) and the game can be a little chaotic with 4 people. Fairly minor issues in my mind.

:d10-2::d10-3:

2/15: I'm pretty sure this would already be a good game without the hidden colors. But with them, it's elevated to a whole new level.

Played this originally as a 3-player game and couldn't see the matrix. With 2, there's more control over your own scoring, and deduction is a bit more interesting. Conversely, the incentive manipulation of the 3-player game is gone when played with 2.

8/15: I tried and was wrong about the game being good without hidden colors.

Furthermore, I'm not sure how much I like the game. It's interesting, but I don't find any a-ha moments during the game that make me want to immediately play again. If this feeling continues, I'll probably downgrade to a 6.

10/16: I'm convinced that if I played this with very strong players, we would have some interesting conversations on good play. But I feel like I'm stuck on an unsatisfying level of play, where movement choices are somewhat random and deduction is somewhat accidental. Downgraded to a 6.

The genius of this game is the fact that you don't know who is which colour. Many levels of strategy make this a real gem. One draw back is the 2 player problem where last settlements get down to 3 adjacent regions and one player scopes all the remaing tokens. Needs a fix

Move my huts away from each other when more than two, move my huts closer when only one in big groupings, move others huts closer to mine when i have two grouped, move other peoples huts into threes, move others huts away from big groups; don't worry about people finding out which color you are they won't be certain enough quickly enough for it to matter. Make a blatant power move for a colour that isn't mine in the first 5 moves of the game.

I love this 20 minute game as a filler. On your turn you move one regions clans (5 different types) to another region. If a region is isolated it scores points. The majority clan gains more points, but if all are present, it's destroyed. Add to the fact that each player is a clan in secret, you get these easy rules, high strategy, and quite a punch in a quick little game.

Surprisingly better than I expected, Clans has its strongest point in the easy and fast way it plays: no strategy is involved, at least none requiring two or more turns, since the other players’ moves will likely hinder it, either intentionally or unintentionally.

Apart from this, Clans only requires players to push wooden huts here and there and wait for a lucky shot, which couldn’t even come.
The hidden color attribution is a nice addition and helps making this simple game just a bit more strategic.

RATING: 7
This is my favourite abstract game. Much like Hey, That's My Fish, Clans can be enjoyed equally as a casual game or deeper and more strategically by experienced players. Great components, colorful, and easy to learn and play. It scales well and a typical game lasts between 20-30 minutes.   Despite the simple rules and short play time, Clans offers surprising depth and high replayability, making it an underrated little gem.

I have played this.  I'm not sure what has kept me away...the setup perhaps?  

Update:  Played again after 6+ years.  Not sure what kept me away but it's a great game.  I'm a Colvini fan now so I figured I'd give it another shot.  Like many of his games, abstract, nice movement, some plan ahead.  Each turn is intense in this one and trying to figure out who is what color is cool.  This bump from a 5 to 7.5 is based on two players.  I think 3 would be the sweet spot but more than that would be fun, too.

My first session of clans was somewhere early 2003 and at that time it didn't appeal to me at all (rated it only '4' at that time).

Personally I prefer knowing from the start who is your opponent though...

In Clans it's difficult to figure how to get what you want, but some experience let you do better and better moves. I prefer as 2 players game because there are more control and more chances to cheat the other player.

Another fun little game. Not a ton of depth to it, but a good way to pass an hour or half.

Clans uses a board that represents... Europe? Some land mass with lakes and rivers, somewhere, where primitive people live. Anyway, the board gets covered with little coloured huts that represent individual tribes. Players move huts, or groups of huts, around the board trying to isolate them, thus scoring points for each colour. Conflict can occur if there are isolated groups that have only one of a given colour, resulting in that colour not getting any points that turn.

Different terrains are useful/useless at different times in the game, and paying attention to timing is critical. Bluffing is also important because players do not reveal which colour they're playing.

There's no luck in this game, beyond not getting screwed by your fellow players' seeming-incompetence. I reccomend it.

RATING: 6
An interesting, surprisingly challenging abstract. The hidden information makes this such a bewildering experience at first, as you try to score your color without giving it away, while trying to avoid scoring your opponent. Long-term planning seems almost impossible, but necessary as most of the big scoring comes at the end of the game. The window in which that big scoring happens, however, is so tiny that your chance of getting the terrain you need right when you need it is very slim. I'd like to get better at it, but I fear I won't play enough to do so. Would make a great iOS app.

There is bluffing and deduction when it comes to figuring out who has which colour as you will lose if others can figure out your colour. There is spatial recognition in knowing which configurations are stable and which are unstable. The rules are very simple. The board set-up is dynamic. It scales very well from two to four.

However, at times the game can enter into a cycle where just one player is forming all the camps and getting all the points, in which case all the bluffing and deduction in the world is useless.

Based on 1 play with 4 players: Can't get enough of good abstracts. The bluffing element makes this one stand out from the crowd, though so far I'm not certain it's all that important to keep tabs on the other player's colors. It will give you an edge, certainly, but doesn't seem to be all that necessary. I like that while there's a good amount of strategy here, it still manages to feel pretty light and move at a nice brisk pace. Definitely want to play more of this.

I do not get Colovini's games. I seem able to figure out everyone's color pretty quickly, but have NO idea how to capitalize on this fact. It seems the people who make no effort to hide what color they are do the best, so that part of the game becomes a red herring. 
Bone-dry and flavorless. Just not my kind of game, and I don't think it's just because I stink something awful at it.

A simple set of rules masks a quite intriguing little game. So far, after three two-player games with My wife, I've really enjoyed the subtle masking of your player color, the temptations to give it away, the pretty little forks the shrinking board allows. It is no surprise this is from the same designer as Bridges of Shangri-la. The reduction, the parasitism. They are both here, but in a lighter, more intuitive package that plays two rather well.

It's the end of the week and it's kind of late,
with the kids asleep,
my wife promised me "a date".

I must have that crazy look in my eye
'cause all I hear is,
"No game tonight, don't even try."

"But this one is light,
and it plays real fast.
This one you'll like - I just think you might!"

In 20 minutes we're done, we're through.
"Wow - that game is clever,
thank you, thank you!"

Ok, perhaps that last line is sort of made up.
But it IS a great game 
for two players and up.

Sadly, this game is now O-O-P,
but just let me know,

Underrated on the 'Geek' in my opinion.  The theme is very fun, it's super quick to learn, and the game can be very deep if you want to get into it (or you can just randomly move and still have fun).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
This is a hard game to get right.  You are trying to force your opponent into poor scoring position without knowing who your opponent is.  Conversly, you are trying to set yourself up for some late game scoring without tipping your hand as to what color is yours.  It can therefore seem kind of random until you start seeing the natural forking points that exist on the board and how to minimize the scoring potential of groups you are not a part of.  Of course, you are doing this while also sometimes putting yourself in a poor position to score to keep your identity obscured from the other players.  I love that most of my games of this come down to the reveal.  Who in the hell were you?  Did you just beat me?  When a game can do this, it is something special.

RATING: 7
This is an superb abstract strategy game with bluffing element.  Not a whole lot else to say - it's short, quick, elegant, and all around good.  Definitely worth the price and time investment.  I'd rate it higher if most of my light gaming time wasn't consumed by Dominion.

RATING: 6.5
Light and quick.  A bit of chaos.  My wife kicked my butt the first time we played, so this is a good thing.  This may be one of those games to join Lost Cities, En Garde, Balloon Cup and Odin's Ravens as games she requests and wins more than half the time. 

3 players is optimal.  The problem with 4 is that only 1 color is not accounted for....which creates less tension around the bluffing.  If you don't incorporate some guile into bluffing which color you're playing....you're missing out on a huge chunk of what this game is about. Reading other comments, I get the sense a lot of people don't give much energy to that aspect of Clans.

Very interesting game which is easy to learn and quick to play but is full of tactics and strategy. The optimal play is far from easy to see. Perhaps that explains my dismal performance. The game involves merging tribes of 5 different colors. Anytime a single or group of tribes becomes isolated it is scored. It should also be noted this game can play easily with 5 although it says 2 to 4. The game does play better with 4 and I think with 3 it may be even better. I could see this being a incredible 3 player game. Just a further comment on this game. I&#039;ve had the chance to play some two player games and they are incredible as well. This game is far from a lightweight game. It can be played fast similar to the way you could play SpeedChess but the possible combinations far outweight Chess the way I see it so its actually deeper.

The first few years I owned this game, I was extremely hesitant to suggest Clans to visitors. I felt it wasn't sufficiently fun. But after a few games on BrettSpielWelt, I grew more confident, and discovered that its star was rising the more I played it. It also helped that I am now better able to hide what colour I play. That particular mechanic is what [i]really[/i] makes the game, by the way: if you cannot master it, you will dislike the game. Unfortunately that is something you just have to find out in practice. Rules are short and simple, but at times a little contrived. The gameplay can be quite involved because of almost Faidutti-like reverse psychology, but it has a satisfying crescendo finale notwithstanding. The presentation is also very good. A solid and fun game, clearly one of Colovini's better titles.

Clans hasn't done a whole lot for me in the past - the connection-manipulation and deduction of who's which color are both interesting, but not enough so that I really enjoy playing much. I suspect I might like it more with fewer than four players?

[ETA: Indeed - the one three-player game I've had of this was much more enjoyable. More control over the board's events and two dummy colors instead of one made a big difference.]

[And I hear it's even better with two. Might want to reacquire this.]

I've played a couple of games now with 2, 3 and 4 players. Ít's a funny game, easy to learn and easy to play, but not so easy to win. I like the theme a lot and also the fact that noone knows until the very end who plays with which colour. The games only take 15-20 minutes, so it's a perfect filler and usually asks for a rematch :)

Have only played this 2-player and was hoping it'd be better with more, but I keep reading it's best with only two. Haven't played it enough to be fair with this initial rating, but I still feel lost and can't see the magic in the game yet.

Update: I still feel stupid and confused when playing, but I enjoyed a four player game much more. But I can understand why abstract purists/enthusiasts prefer 2-player instead.

Quick, random setup, attractive components, and as good a theme as you're going to find with rules this simple.  There is bluffing, deduction, timing, and plenty of room for creative play, all in a tidy 20-minute package.  It even scales well; if it feels too chaotic, play it until the subtleties emerge.

RATING: 6.5
An abstract game where each player's color is hidden from other players. There is value in trying to fool the other players into believing you are a different color.

As far as gameplay, each turn you combine tribes in two adjacent board regions. When the combined region no longer borders any other region, it is scored. When there are no further regions to combine, the game ends.

A very good game even though it might seem chaotic at times. I love the secret colour part as it really spices up the game. Now if I could just come up with a good rule covering the last village scoring too much. At the moment I think we give out 3 points instead of 5. Still not happy.

RATING: 5
Players move villages in five colours around the board, ultimately into isolated clusters.  Each colour in the cluster will score the cluster size.  Each player has a secret colour they are trying to trigger to score lots of times, without revealing it to the other players.  The game has a nice, pacey feel to it, and is very easy to pick up.

Clans is an excellent and fast game. Excellent filler. One of favorites. Not everyone I play with likes this game.

If you are looking to play a quick game, this is an excellent choice regardless if you play 2, 3, 4 players.

Clans is great if you want to hide your color from the other players and play to your advantage. I enjoy trying to move the huts that helps my cause for a possible win and at the same time it won't give my color away and keep players guessing.

There are always 5 colors. Playing with 4 players, each has a secret color and one color is nobody's. So there is a guessing game which player is what color. So you try to score more points than the others players and try to hide your own color as much as possible to keep them guessing.

TRADED.

This one's just SO easy to teach - move a hut or group of huts; if isolated, score.  With the secret of who's who you're trying to throw people off the scent so that your color isn't obvious, but you don't want to put yourself in the hole too deeply with too big a bluff.

2018-02-06 : First play. As a 2-player game this is a fine thinky abstract with more depth than I first suspected. Somehow it reminded me of a superior kind of checkers where position is everything. With more players I can see the Collovini Chaos (tm) taking over, so I wouln't play this with more than 2 players. So a "6" for the 2-player game, "4" with more players.

Interesting game, with a neat 'hidden ownership' mechanism - though towards the end it usually seems becomes fairly obvious which colours are spoken for. The trick is to manouevre the pieces on the board so that other players will help score for your colour, even if it means forgoing creating villages yourself. Plays quickly, especially with 2.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Clans is an no luck abstract game of area majority and secret roles.  It plays fairly quickly and each player turn is one action that can possibly cause scoring or hut destruction.  The pacing changes dramatically from start to finish and it's just something to be aware of and shouldn't be an issue after repeated plays.  I enjoyed this one more than Carolus Magnus by the same author as there's no luck in it.  I guess it's not really fair to compare them as they are very different games, but if I had to choose one, it would most certainly be Clans.

Good grief is this game fun.  It's totally an abstract that, weirdly, feels perfectly thematic to me as well.

Clans is quick, psychologically tense and totally unique in my collection.  I simply can't think of anything else quite like it. 
 
Figuring out how to maneuver yourself and, of course, incentivizing others to do the maneuvering for you --all without giving away your color-- just creates so much freaking tension.      

A comically underrated game.  I absolutely love it.

RATING: 6
An abstract strategy version of Heimlich and Co. I like Heimlich and Co., so that's a complement from me. Easy rules and fast startup, and the board has the feel of early 2000s crappy graphic design, which is not a problem. I'm thinking I'm not interested in playing this again unless it's exactly with three players. With four, I saw the game's potential, but too much happened between my turns, destroying any semblance of strategy I had.

A good little abstract game for those that like that sort of thing. Here the trick is that the color you're playing is hidden and you can place any color down on the board.

Based on several plays.
+ Having colors hidden keeps the tension high.
> With two players, everything is under control. Players seek to maximize their gain.
> With many players, nothing is under control. Full chaos! Players seek to minimize risks(, which is sort of maximizing gain, too). I like it.
> The box says 2-4 players? Why not with five players? I see no problem, just a bit more chaos. After all, players' colors are still unknown.
- Sometimes dry.
- Theme is distant and doesn't help to understand all the rules.

Challenging tactics without requiring brain-burning strategy. Good game. (F --> traded for Settlers of Catan: Cities and Knights Expansion.)

[Aggregation, Prehistoric, Civilization] [4P:6, 3P:6, 2P:6] So far, this is my favorite Leo Colovini game. Leo's frequently scored for making abstractish games, but the theme of Clans works. Hey, who can't appreciate racial genocide due to differing hut colors? This is a simple game, with each player moving all the huts in one region into another region, then resolving the move. Easy to learn, easy to teach, quick to play. I use it as a gateway game with a good success rate. Rules can be taught in five minutes, but the newbies will be scratching their heads in short order. Good way to learn the Way of the No Luck German Game. See my review for more.

This is a great little abstract about moving huts across a board to form villages.  Each player represents one set of huts of a certain color, but no one knows who is who.  Bluffing is important, and there is good opportunity for some clever moves.  The board is quite large for a game that comes in this size of a box.  If you like abstracts, this is a great 20-30 minute filler.

It had a bit of deduction when trying to figure out who is playing which colour, a bit of bluffing when trying to keep the other players from doing just that, and a lot of tactical manoeuveringin order to get your clan in front without being too obvious about it. Clans is one of very few Colovini games I enjoy.

Played one game and liked it. It is not a great game (classic) but is "interesting." Lot's of things to think about. I feel it is actually an abstract game with a theme pasted on to make it a bit more interesting. Don't know that I would buy it - but is is on my "wait and see list."

I believe that this a very fun and very underrated abstract strategy game.  It is very strategic with 2 players, and more chaotic with more players.  I highly recommend this game for 2-3 players because of it's ultra-simple rules and for its fun and challenging gameplay.

RATING: 8.255
There is something very presentable about Clans; the board is nice, the huts are good to look at, touch and move, the rules are very simple and yet there seems an obvious depth to the strategy I have yet to fully understand.  Alas, my fellow gamers are not as enamored as I.  So, an enjoyable tactical game that seems to have a depth (albeit chaotic) even though it involves a simple move mechanism (13/12/08).  UPDATE: A game with staying power; still like it a lot; a pity no one else I know does - rating increase to 8 (23/10/11). UPDATE: Ditto; but rating now 8.255 (to make a sortable Top 100: Jan 15).

This is a fairly light game that involves trying to get your pieces clustered with a scoring group without letting the other players know what your color is. If you spend any time trying to deduce the color of your opponents, then you'll likely be engaged and interested. Outside of that, there's not a whole lot to it. It can be fun, but I just don't know how many replays I'd be interested in.

There are many games that hide the identities of the players, but rarely has the idea been used as effectively as it is in Clans.  When observing a player's move, there's usually more than one explanation for what she might be trying to accomplish, making it difficult to figure out who that player represents.  Also, the incentives for forming a tribe help to muddle the matter.  "Is he scoring points with that move, or going for the bonus token?"  The 4-player game collapses in total chaos, and is not worth playing.  The 2-player game affords the most control, but is marred slightly by the Nim-like (a.k.a Dots & Boxes) standoff situations that arise.  The 3-player game lets you have a significant influence on the directions things are taking, but the game always feels like it's on the verge of spinning out of your control.  I think that's just the right balance of control against drama for this game of tactics and psychology.  Three controlled colors and two neutral colors also makes for a nice balance.  Leave Clans on the shelf if you have four players, but it works nicely as a "meaty filler" for two or three, provided that you aren't repulsed by the bland theming, the ugly presentation, or the abstract feel.

RATING: 6
Nice game and satisfies the joy of playing.
I would not support &quot;deeper than you think &quot;, because I didn&#039;t find the deep strategy. Most of the times it is rather disadvantageous than contrary, when you have a majority of your colour in a field, because you don&#039;t get more points, but you have less opportunities to be part of more upcoming villages.
i.e.: I saw only 1 village, where all colours were involved and after all others disappeared, the left 1 hut got 1 point – so what?
And as the own colour is a secret till game end – most part of the game is somehow a random scoring.
But as I said – it satisfies the joy of playing :o)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Basically, Clans is a big game of chicken -- what player will make a play that lets the next player form a village?  The last village is especially important, because it's always worth 5 extra points.  That many points can often be the decider, so getting to form that last village is where you want to be, and you don't want to set someone else up to form it.  But even knowing all this, I don't know if there is a good strategy for this game, because there are way too many variables.  It's a real brain burner if you try to thoroughly analyze each move.

Perhaps I would rate this game higher if I played it with more than 2 -- at which count the game felt highly between being zero-sum and highly deductive.
---------------
Update: January 2015.
Recently re-acquired the game. Planning on playing it with more than, but also as one of social deduction rather than a strict abstract.

Update: July 2015
So it's official. My tastes have changed. I'm down with this kind of positional play/deduction that is really clever. A few incentives here, some there, but a lot of bluffing, deceipt and diversion.

New comment on Clans (in its second life):
-----------------------------------------------------------
Clans offers a reverse-connection game mechanic. By this, I mean that it inverts the "connect the nodes" formula by taking an (quasi-)infinitely connected set of nodal-relationships and the game is one of reducing them to only nodes by cutting away at the connective tissue. Not only this, but to make things even more devious, Colvini (the designer) addresses the potential solvability of such game theory exercise by making scoring occur every time a non-connected node is created. However, the valuation is fuzzy as there are five colours to be included in the nodes, but you don't know which one your opponent is. The tension is quite delicious is in how you must work at deducing your opponents' colour (of 5, one of which you can outright put of the list, since it is yours) while masking your own colour (with a very limited action space -- spend too many actions diverting attention and your score might suffer!). 

Generally presence is all that is required to score points -- if yellow is present with one house, and black with 3, both black and yellow score 4 points (the total of houses in the area). However, Colvini also adds a vicious rule which also inverts and complicates clustering (as "filler" points) -- should the node have all 5 colours, the 'cherry-picking' inidividual colours get kicked out of town, scoring nothing. 

Fantastic little game: a bare-bone structure that doesn't get in the way of playing the other player(s).
--------------------------------------------------------
Update - October 2015
Wow. This game, brilliantly partners deduction, spatial abstract thinking, a few interesting and shifting scoring conditions to make for a brilliant game that allows for so many wrinkles from so little. I think that this is Colvini's best.

I found the board and pieces of this game to be attractive.  However, the game play has always left me flat.  I don't know if it is the theme (or lack thereof) or the repettitive play.  Overall, I felt the game does not have enough player interraction, lacks depth, and takes too long for what it is.

For player interraction and variability, I prefer Settlers of Catan, for resource management I prefer Ticket to Ride, for territory management I prefer Doge, and board movement I prefer Elfenland. I just cannot find any reason to play Clans.

A simple abstract with some psychological and bluffing elements. The rules are simple enough for this to be played by children, but there's still plenty going on. It can be a game where you're dependent on your right-hand neighbour to give you a scoring opportunity, but the scoring's tight  and with 1 point per village created you can tempt your left-hand neighbour into creating a village that advantages you. Among the best of the 'twenty minuters'.

I find Clans to be distinctly average.  I like abstract games, but this game does not keep my interest at all.  Too much seems to be out of my control, so I never know what to do on my turn to pursue any sort of strategy.

RATING: 5
I love the fact you dont know what colour anybody is playing except your own. Though I got frustrated about the lack of strategy in the game. You can try and set things up but altermately it is only close to the end that you may have tough choices. Most of the time you just score groups whenever possible.

Very Simple and Quick filler that has a little more to it than luck

*Update* Reduced score from a 6 to a 5. It's an alright filler game but can get bogged down by players who put too much thought into a simple game. The hidden roles portion is somewhat ridiculous as it doesn't have people play all that much differently. I suppose it takes out the kingmaker problem but that's about all.

RATING: 7
First played June 23rd, 2007.  This is a quick learn (5min) and quick play (~30min).  I played as two player and it seemed to have a good balance of strategy and luck, although the strategy side weighs more.  I enjoyed it and look forward to playing again.  I'd higly reccommed giving this a gameplay on your table and consideration in playing on a regular basis.  It's filler type material and rocks at that.  So don't wait for it to be a filler to play.

RATING: 7.25
Clever game where you move huts to form villages.  Each player secretly is one colour and you are forming villages & scoring points for the five colours of huts.  Very fast, exceptionally simple, but nice and thinky.  Meant for 2-4 players, but played five with no problems.  Great game.

I'm with those that just don't find this game exciting.  Set up is a pain, but the game just seems too random to me.

Another well liked [person=138]Leo Colovini[/person]. This 30 minute game has amazing depth.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I like the concept and the bluff game is quite intriguing. Some thinking required here it is deeper than it first seems and the best move isn't always easy to see. This can suffer from the "sitting to left of the weak player" syndrome and unbalance the game so either sit to the left if there is one or play 2 player. Very dry but makes a great filler

update: okay 7 plays already upped the rating, I enjoy the 2 player quite a bit, a good little challenging game with interesting scoring and of course the great bluff aspect

update: rating dropped a bit now, it seems in the 2 player games players will move huts around until all the huts are grouped in 3 territory groups, then the poor sucker who has to go next is the one who gets shafted and can't do anything about it, he is forced to give the clan making opportunities to the other player...hmmm not good. Rating will drop more if this continues

Very abstract, very dry, and (thankfully) short abstract game. Not much more than a "filler" and not one I'd particularly care to play again.  I have played it live and online a few times and I just really really don't like this game. It's just not my style whatsoever. No matter how many times I play this, how to play this game well just eludes me and I just don't get it.

RATING: 6.4
Ideal for games of 20-30 minutes. Minimum 4 players. Simple, easy to learn, quick-playing with a deeper strategic element than at first you might think; delightful to try to manipulate the formation of villages, without giving away one's color. Pretty much empty of luck yet easy enough for casual gamers

Initial Rating: 6.0 (November 2010)

Clans is a light medium game, it has more depth than it is initially apparent. Its bestselling point (for me) is the hidden identity of the players, you have to carefully observe your opponents trying to discover their color AND at the same time you have to stay hidden as long as possible, all of this while you try to maximize points for your color :D. It is harder than it sounds and I really like it. 

The game has almost no theme, but the game board and components are quite colorful and look great on the table. Also, the game plays VERY quickly. The rules can be explained under 3 minutes.

I´m on the fence when I try to decide the best number of players for this game. It seems 4 players can be hard to control and plan for and (for now) it seems 2 players is the sweet spot for me but I will play more to really confirm this part. Still I won’t say no to a game of Clans no matter the number of players.

I’m rating it a 6.0 because I consider it a good game BUT many times I have no desire to play it (I think this is due to the dry theme), so I only play it from time to time, also the quick play time makes it a burden to set it up.

Current Rating: 6.0

2017-02-19

I’m currently checking my game collection for games to sell, the reason is that I have many games and I want to reduce the size of it. When I checked Clans I realized my desire to play it again is rather low, even if I think it is a clever game, so I sold it.

It pains me a bit because I think it is a good design, but it was an ok game for me so it went.

New one for me, only played 3 times. Seems very elegant, fairly abstract, slightly dry, unique in my experience, simple simple rules take just a couple minutes to explain (although I did find myself adding "just one more thing" several times when explaining it). The theme is irrelevant but it lends pretty colours.

It's been relegated to the back of the cupboard. My wife finds it too dry.

Eventually traded away. (I don't usually trade stuff.)

RATING: 5
Not sure if it's as deep as some are claiming.  It is certainly worth the $25 since it plays well with gamers, nongamers, and kids.  
The most interesting comment that I have read from others is that it is a "glorified version of nim."  I'm not sure that it is truly that solvable a game, but the resemblance (trying to force your opponent to give you the correct conditions to make a village) is striking.  I suspect that skillful bluff and strategic movement of your own pieces can help to negate this effect.

Update:  This hasn't hit the table in over 2 years and I haven't missed it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Probably best played as a strategic 2-player game, and as such doesn't rate much higher than a 7.

RATING: 8.5
Deceptively simple underrated game with interesting drama, deduction, tactical strategic decisions, and bluffing. Great-grandson of Nim, cousin Tzaar, or the grandson of Xe Queo, (Not surprising since Randolph was Colivini's mentor.) I love games with hidden players! First couple turns kind of random but quickly gels as villages conglomerate and you start to get hints of your opponent's color. Frankly, much longer than 5 epochs would be boring--which is just where game ends!  My wife won't play because she finds the theme too violent, which is funny because it's so pasted on, even by Eurogame standards.

Good game concept, somewhat challenging.  Very colorful.  A little dry though.  Trying to figure out what color your opponents have is very fun.  At the start of the game, it is hard to differentiate between the various moves, I often feel like I am picking a random one out of many almost equivalent moves.  Difficult to make things happen, it is more about avoiding moves that might help your opponent.  Suffers from serious kingmaker problems with 3  players.

In Clans, each player chooses a secret identity (one of the five clans on the board). During the game, they can maneuver any clan or cluster of clans on their turn. All five clans score points, even if there are only two players. What you end up with a a light maneuvering game enlivened by a bit of deduction - which clan must be stopped?

The components are underwhelming to say the least, but I recommend giving Clans a try as a two-player game. It might be tolerable with three. I would never play with four.

One of these games that are best in online turn-based mode (other ones are Bus or Reef Encounter). You have to take notes on each player  to find out his secret colour and plan each move.

An interesting idea. Very dry with limited meaningful options (unless you were to spend hours and hours playing), leaving it very endgame heavy. 

Quick to play and doesn't take as long to set up as people seem to suggest. Most fun part is finding out who people were at the end of the game. Will play again but only if pushed. 

It will also play 5!

I'll admit I found it difficult to get a grasp on what you're supposed to do in this game. There is no great impression of control: it seems to come down to whether you're being handed scoring opportunities and whether those benefit you appreciably compared to the leader. I might rate it one point higher if not for the last-hut scoring bonus, which is a big swing yet is largely determined by seating order/caprice.

I adore this game. I really love it. Played with 2, 3 and 4. Always loved it. More control with less players, which can be good or bad, but the difference is never too big so you're completely out of control. Good abstract that deserves recognition. Though with 2 players who play well, it sometimes just comes down to who moves first to win.

RATING: 9
Fun, quick game.  A bit of strategy, but you can't plan everything out.  Hard to get mad at folks (for grumpy players) given mystery of who is who.  Nice and easy, a fast 15-30 min play.  I like to bring it out, although not for everyone it seems.  Some folks feel too random, although randomness comes from other player actions.

I liked this game for a good while, but the importance of the last village and the dependence on equal skill have soured the game a bit.  There can be some kingmaking issues, as you can only be so tricky with your limited moves before they really hamper your scoring.  Groups that focus too much on reining everybody in equally will just get taken by the village chip holder.  Some house rules might fix some of these issues.  At least the game is pretty quick.

Most of the time I try a Colovini I just feel “It’s a good and novel idea, but a very simple and dry game, not that much fun”, but Clans is different: it might be the most fun of his games that I have tried. I’m not sure it works with 4 (it might be too chaotic) but with two I really enjoyed it. For some reason it has the feel of a somewhat simpler China – some simple rules creating a rather interesting web of effects for your very simple action: move all the markers from one region to a neighboring non-empty region. That’s all but it’s not as easy as it seems; it has a fine and interesting dynamic.

Quick playing filler that would definitely be best with 3 players.  We tried it with 5 and it worked although there was little to no control and it was very chaotic.  Easy to teach, learn, and play.  You are basically attempting to advance one tribe while hurting all the other tribes by moving huts around to build villages.

Is it Colovini at his best? No, certainly not. Is there a decent game in the box? Definitely. I think the designer was stetching himself on this one, and I believe it was worth that stetch. Not many games employ mechanics that this game employs (hidden teams, etc.), and for that the designer deserves the credit.

A recommendation from a Geek Buddy brought this game to my attention, and I'm glad for it as it's been well received by me and my friends. Though hidden identities of player colors can usually be sussed out during play, surprises still occur occasionally to keep games interesting. The short play time also helps keep interest from waning, especially for those who find themselves behind in scoring towards the end. The variable set up and abundance of board positions from which to choose an action every turn challenges players to jockey pieces into profitable groupings either with or without the help of their opponents.

Location, location, location - even the neanderthal knew the importance of property.  Position yourself in the location which will give you the greatest return without giving your identity away or be thrown out if 'strife' occurs.  Alternatively keep an eye on your opponents actions and position them in the most inopportune position and at the most inopportune time (as the game progresses different terrains become more valuable while some are best avoided).  A subtle game with a simple premise, Clans is ideal for groups containing newcomers to boardgames or for that tricky number of 3 players.

(Note - now we are all getting well acquainted with the game it is starting to play very quickly and we are strating to feel that there is less of a game or less return for bringing it to the table - I feel this is totally unfair - but it makes me wonder as with number of players is there also a sweet spot for time taken to play for games of certain weight)

RATING: 7.5
This is definately an abstract strategy game with a pasted on theme. While not wholly an 'open information' game, it's the precise lack of certain information (a players color) that makes this such a great multi-player abstract game. And it plays remarkably well with 2-5 players (I realize the box says 2-4, but there is no reason a 5th player can't join in without affecting the gameplay).

Played only on BSW.  This game just sits there like a lump of lead - no life, no rhythm, no meaningful theme.  Perhaps the worst example of lather-rinse-repeat I've come across in a German game so far.  If speed Clans wasn't such a good resource generator on BSW I doubt I'd ever play this again.

Played against the computer on this web site:
http://www.marquand.net/staticpages/index.php?page=clans

The implementation is really superb and the AI seems real good.

Now for the game : it's really interesting. Theme is not real present, it's almost fully abstract but I like the touch added but the different epochs VS hostile terrain. I like that you can "destroyed" your opponent village. The fact the all player's color are hidden is also nice since it adds a bluff element to the game.

I don't understand all the subtilities of the game (I lose a lot of games against the computer) but I like the gameplay. It's simple and quick and there's plenty of relexion (but not too much). The board is also really nice and colorful. It's not always easy to know if you have created a village (especially with the rivers and lakes) but you get used to it quickly. 

I like the way it's possible to "prepare" a few village isolation and letting the opponent close it (event if they take the bonus).

All in all a good quick game that plays well with 2, 3 or 4 (but there is a lot more chaos to it).

A surprisingly good game for how simple it is.  Gorgeous components and simplistic play make this a well-received gem by the group.  It will probably see regular play as an opener or a filler, just because it plays fast.  However, we have noticed that games are unusually quiet, as players use downtime between turns to study their next move.  Still, this doesn't detract from the game at all.

Clans is a really cool little game. It's an abstract at heart, but with the addition of a bluffing element. That bluffing piece is what makes it shine, in my opinion. I had a great time playing it with my wife as a 2 player. She's much better at abstracts, but I can win at this game too because it's not a pure abstract. The only concern I have is that this game could feel samey after several plays because players utilize the same strategy. I'm not there yet, to be sure, so still having fun.

Quick, fun, and subtle - players move huts to form villages and score points, you only score if a hut of your color is in the village. The trick is that to start to the game the colors are distributed secretly, so you don't know which colors other people have. So the key to the game is aiding your color without seeming to, otherwise any player who figures out who you are can really stick it to you late in the game.

This is a simple, quick game, which is actually kind of "heavy" because after the initial set up there is no luck involved. To me this game is best with three players and I avoid playing it with any other number. My knock against this game is that the final two villages are very important, too important. You will usually not win without being in both of them and you will often have to rely on other players to create the village you need. Also, lends itself to analysis paralysis more than most games in the same niche. Overall however, a fun game that I don't hesitate to pull out with three players.

Simple, strategic, abstract, plays well with 2 and 3, what's not to love? While the rules are very simple, there are very interesting aspects to the gameplay; a little bluffing in that you do not know what color your opponent is, and you must try to hide your color, different ways to score over time in different areas. Its a little dry, but so simple, fun and colorful that you'll never notice. Colovini masterpiece.

Not sure what to think after one two-player game. The most important strategic consideration, which I had not anticipated, seems to be timing scoring to either add bonus points to a favored region or wipe out a region entirely. Certainly seems that this will be best with two or three players.

Note - We made a rule mistake. When all colors are present in a scored village, only singles are removed, not one of each color!

Basically an abstract with an extremely thin theme.  I'm not big on abstracts, but I enjoyed this one.  If you enjoyed his Bridges of Shangri-La you'll probably like this as well, although I would say this is a bit simpler to teach and play.  I've played with 2 and 3 and definitely liked it more with 2 players.  The key to this game is the direct back and forth of trying to set up your opponent to make a decision between helping one of two tribes.  I felt like I was always trying to balance earning more points for my tribe and also being elusive about my color.

This is a pretty good, light, abstact, gateway game.   Most of all it's enjoyable and I like the added layer that you're colour is secret.  UPDATE: The game is easy to learn but not necessarily light... it scales well with the abilities of the players.  Add 1/2 point to rating.

RATING: 7.5
Great light-medium filler game.  Actions are simple enough to explain readily, and once understood each player's turn is quick and simple.  This quick "flow" can easily be affected by over-analysis, however.  Strategy is picked up readily, although takes a while (i.e. a couple plays) to start playing very well. Great fun in trying to guess who is playing what colour! 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Interesting little game with a short play time. The theme bizarrely fits well, and the mechanic of not knowing who controls each color adds a nice twist. Ideal is to play with 2 and 3. The problem is that it tends to lead to some AP.

Well, that has got to be the weirdest horse-racing game I've ever played. I think that's a safe statement in that most horse race games bear less of a resemblance to [gameid=2346]. It's [i]almost[/i] combinatorial, except that it's totally not. Which is, even though I quite enjoy combinatorial games, a good thing - perfect information games don't work well multiplayer, and this does. And it's also in this weird place between filler and meat. I'm glad I got it; it fits a niche. A really weird niche.

I can't really explain why this game called to me after getting back into the hobby recently, but something about it's echo from 12 years ago caught my attention. It's chaos that slowly becomes order through each move and you just have to keep your eyes peeled for attack and defense opportunities. It opened my eyes to a designer that I may otherwise have passed up in Colovini. I have now tried several of his games and am continually impressed. How is this guy not talked about more often?!

Most people feel that Clans plays best with three players, and I think they are probably correct.  I typically play with two, four or more players.  I have only played two and four player games of Clans, and although I liked it, I still would like to try a three-player game.  Clans is quite simple to learn and there are some good strategic decisions to make, but I don%u2019t think it will ever be one of my favorite games.

The only Colovini game I own is a very good game which mixes bluffing, abstract and area control. It's a great game, with the only big limitations of being a little bit repetitive, which is best played with two, when the game is in full control of the contenders (with more the chaos scles up exponentially). I must remember myself to buy more Colovinis...

The area control mechanisms remind me of my own game Iconoclasm, where it is the "sum" of all the players' actions that count, and I would like to test how this application of them work out.

Played it and love it! Move clans to set up high scoring villages for your color without revealing it. The hidden objectives may deter some players but it keeps the game tense and open to the very end.

I've mostly played this as a 2-player game, where the principle strategy seems to be disguising your color.  I like having to devise moves that don't give away my identity, but set up later positions where I'm maximizing my own scores.  

I really enjoy the changing era mechanic, especially combined with moves that create 2 villages spanning 2 eras, crushing your enemy's valuable village and giving your own village bonuses.

One dynamic I don't care for is the point in the game where you're looking for the one remaining move you can make that doesn't give a village to your opponent.

RATING: 6
At the beginning of the game, players are given a secret color of tribe to control. Move tribes or group of tribes to cause strife and earn VPs in certain terrain. Somtimes getting your own forces eradicated is beyond your control. Have played this with 5 players, by having a player take the neutral tribe. More tactical with a lesser number of players. It's not a bad game, but you need patience but it also depends what scoring opportunities are left for you or your opponents. If one of your opponents is constantly getting scoring opportunites, then it is tough to combat that. It is a quick game, so it is not too painful to sit through if you are getting crushed, and it is fun when things are going your way.

One of my all-time favorite filler games, this plays quickly but somewhat counter-intuitively at first. Hidden goals make players second guess what their actions should be, lest they make themselves too obvious and become the target of other players. Subtly discovering others' identities and using that to your advantage becomes the name of the game, but the clever scoring mechanisms (which balance safety in numbers against the desire to participate in as many scorings as possible keep this interesting over the long run). Great game.

RATING: 7
Game that tries out another variation of shrinking board: this time fields are emptied and their pieces are moved to still occupied adjacent fields, all at once. An isolated field bring points to the players represented in it, a coin to the player who isolates it and a bonus if the terrain is appropriate (if the terrain is not appropriate there's no score). While this last mechanism is meant to spice things up, it in fact affects the balance of the gameplay a bit, since the player who isolates most villages has (at least from my experience) clearly more chances of winning the game. 

The other thing in the game that misses the mark a bit is the nearly random distribution of the pieces. True, it avoids experienced players smashing the new ones at the setup and there are so many moves that luck should even out - sometimes it doesn't. Bluffing is a bit unnecessary as well: it takes already enough effort to win playing every round for your colour! If at all, it randomizes the game even more.

Apart from that the game is relatively quick, and fun to play no matter how many people play it. The mechanism is really good - proof to its quality is that Colovini developed the less exciting but way richer The Bridges of Shangri-La on similar ground.

Do you ever see a game here on the Geek and think 'Yep! That one's for me!"? Clans was just that game. As soon as I saw the basic mechanics, I conjured up in my mind a direct cross between three or four of my favourite small-box games (Caesar & Cleopatra, Fjords, Kahuna, a little bit of Dracula - and with a bit of chess thrown in too). Delighted with a cheap BGG purchase, I find it's even better than I had imagined: an extraordinarily deep cross between abstraction, deduction, bluff and downright screwage. And, while it's not quite my favourite game, it comes damn close.

Further Thoughts - a bit of tainted love now with this one. It's just a little bit too routine and impenetrable. The bluff elements are immaculate, but there are not quite the strategic aspects I had hoped for. Downgraded from 10 to 8.5 after we bought Familienbande.

Further, Further Thoughts - the lovely theme in Familienbande is really pushing that game ahead. Downgraded again for just being a little too Deep Thought.

It's amazing the fast pace of this game, so we can almost ignore its flaws, like the kingmaking factor and the excessive strenght of the last clan (bonus of 5 points regardless the terrain). It still demands a good amount of skill.
However, I finally give up of it because of the kingmaking factor. I have now other good games for the time frame.

It got more depressing and abstract with every play. When I play, I know what I'm doing, but I still haven't got a clue really, and not getting clues sucks up valuable time, and your result mostly depends on what the other players do anyway. I gave it away.

The board is laid out with one of each colored hut in each section, then you get a color, which is kept secret. All you can do on your turn is move a hut or set of huts from one location to another non-empty location. Once a location is isolated it scores, but it may score only base points, get bonus points if in the correct terrain or get no points if in the wrong terrain. The ideal terrain changes as the game moves on and since everyone else is doing the same you have to try and get points where you can as you have limited control. Such a simple mechanic but very well implemented.

RATING: 6
In this game, you're moving around yours and other players' hut pieces to try to create isolated groups.  Colors included in these groups all score, but if all colors are present, only colors with more than one hut score.  So you're mostly trying to keep your huts separate for more scoring opportunities, but also trying to double-up where there will be all five colors.  The rules seem to over-stress secrecy; knowing which player is associated with which color doesn't really have a large effect on the game.

Since your clan is hidden and not revealed until the end of the game, there's alot of bluffing to be done.  Definately not a game for everyone, but the subtleties are great.  Trying not to disclose who you are while still trying to make optimal plays for yourself is quite an experience.

Typical Leo Colovini game - [b]dry[/b], [b]abstract[/b] and a theme that has been loosly pasted on. Most of the game is decided by the [i]random[/i] placement of huts - the moving to territories begins, it feels like there isn't much choice, you [i]have to[/i] play the obvious way. Could've been a good game here, but it's hollow somehow. [b]Farlander[/b] is similar game that works better and [b]Age of Gods[/b] is a more [i]thematic[/i] and fun game.

RATING: 8
Simple rules make this a good one to play with unfamiliar friends. Every move made lowers the amount of possible future moves, the huts slowly condense down into villages which are finally scored by how many huts they contain. Very open initially so it's difficult to see a strategy and I tend to just move a few around but your moves become more obvious the further into the game you are. Quite quick to play if you don't spend too much time analysing the permutations as there are thousands!

This is another Colovini classic.  You do not know who your opponents are until the end.  You can often figure it out, but sometimes you are wrong.  Great opportunity for bluffing.  This game is sooooooo simple, and yet I suspect you could get very good at it.  I have only played it about a dozen times.

Played a couple of games with 4 players and the whole gameplay felt unrewarding and like individual moves didn't really matter much long term. At a later phase of the game where you have groups of huts clustered together around the map it doesn't really matter how you move your huts because since you can't move to empty spaces and always have to move your huts from where there's less of them to where there is more the final outcome will always be the same. The +1 point markers are not enough to make a difference either. Still I was told/read that the game is much better when played with 2 players so I'm giving it the benefit of the doubt regarding that.

Received in trade after being on wishlist for many months.

Played it once and I want to play it again.  I keep suggesting it.  I really like the delivery of the game and the production.  I like the big board and large pieces, esp since this game could be redistributed in a much smaller box a-la the newest edition of 'Condottiere' 

Updating:
Played 3 times now, and I'm so glad that I received this in a trade when I did.  It plays fast enough, is easy to introduce to new players, and is devoid of randomness (aside from the secret colour allocation).  Clans is a game that I am glad to own, will not part with, and I'm sure will have plenty of play in my lifetime.

First impression with 5 players (yes I know that&#039;s illegal): your alloted secret colour and tactic to score indistinctly is from Undercover, and the increasing epoch values and manner of clan reduction is from Atilla. The incentive yellow chips for scoring are familiar, but I can&#039;t place. But scoring by isolation is new to me. With 5 there was less deduction issues and less control, but it was still an enjoyable spatial problem solving exercise, though the number crunching is a worry. Another concern is that because the territory value increases are determined, you wonder if the clusters will appear in the same territories in every game, making the game play the same.

Another origianl from Colovini. A nice, relatively short abstract strategy game. Simple concept, but with deep strategy and tactics. It is very engaging and does not feel dry at all.

It is best with 2 and excellent with 3, as long as all 3 are roughly of similar abilities, otherwise the player left of the weak one would reap the benefits from any mistakes. For me, it would be a little too chaotic with 4 and a total chaos with 5.

The basic idea is not bad but the game does not click with me. You just do some semi-random abstract moves and hope for the best. When we played, the whole concept of keeping you colour hidden, as appealing as it sounds in theory did not matter at all and we just tried to maximize points. The player who tried to hide his colour until closer to the end, came in third. I am sure there is some strategy to it but even if you would figure it out, how many meaningful and complex (satisfying) decisions are there to be made in this game ? Not a lot I reckon.

Colovini is an incredibly consistent game designer - I like Clans best of all, as it doesn't overstay its welcome and there aren't too many gimmicks to spoil the tactical gameplay. There's a lot more straight forward "make sure you're in the group that scores" play rather than outright bluffing (I'm always too busy with my own clan to worry about others) and decisions are fairly straight forward, but at 30 mins it's a better filler than most card games.

The game idea is very intriguing, but the execution fails to fulfill expectations.  Of course, that might have been because we played with too many players.

An unusual game in which you must usually make points for your opponents while making some for yourself. Each player knows only his own color, and must guess at the rest, while trying to conceal his own. Strategy is a little obscure until you've played a few times.

Um, it's fast and fine... but why does it matter if people know which color you might be? Didn't seem to make a lick of difference in our game. EDIT: Tried this with two. Made it a MUCH better game. I don't think I'll ever play with four again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I'm usually a Colovini fan, but this one doesn't do it for me.  The secret colour thing doesn't seem to work that well as your score basically is that of your colour, so you want your colour token ahead and the other's behind regardless. The play feels limiting - as you only move one group one space, you only get to do something clever if someone sets it up for you.  Certainly works, is simple, and fairly fast.  I'd happily play it but it lacks any zing for me. I haven't tried with 2 players which may improve the game for me.

I'm a bit of a dummy when it comes to scoring systems like this. 

I'm also hazy about the need to keep your color secret -- I'm horrible at deduction games, and making a deduction a factor in my decision-making isn't my thing. I'm tempted to just flip my tile over and duke it out. 

I prefer open conflict for victory points, but I'll give it a few more tries to see if it ever clicks for me.

I like this more and more with each play. My only downside is that sometimes it just comes down to who has more yellow tokens.

I think this is an incredibly simple game to teach new gamers, and it is not at all intimidating with rules.  Players can only make ONE type of move; thus, the mechanics are really simple.  Under the surface, however, there is great depth as players try to outfox each other.  After playing Clans, I regard Leo Colovini (designer) as one the industry's top designers.  The games I own designed by him all are pretty simple, yet the actual depth and dynamics are brilliant.  This is a "must have" if you want to recruit new Euro gamers to your cause.

Similar to Heimlich & Co., but more of a game.  Both games feel like they have the same level of control though, which isn't much.

Short filler game, and as such it isn't bad.  Plays very quickly, yet contains no luck.  I like the bluffing aspect, componants and terrain rules.  However as a filler it doesn't pack a whole lot of fun and is over before any long term strategy can emerge.

A bit too dry for me. Would enjoy as a pure abstract if not for the fact that the opening of every game always feels loose and inconsequential.

RATING: 9
A clever game where you have to set up your color to score a much as possible without giving away your color, sometimes by setting things up so other players will be too tempted not to take the action you want for you, or sometimes you'll get ahead by just making sure the other colors are destroyed. Lots of fun, very tricky, sometimes hard to figure out which move will is likely to work out best for you.

It seems to rely too much on chance.  I played a great game once - formed half of the villages myself in a 4 player game, but it came down to who formed the last village for the 5 bonus points.  I wasn't in that last village, and so i lost...

I love it because it is different, plays fast (less than 30m), looks fantastic and has a nice combination of interesting tactics and psychology. I keep coming back to it over the years, a classic for me personally.

(2016) The kids do find it somewhat interesting, but it does not yet go over as well as I expected.

Another fine Colvini game, but more opaque than usual. He's quite underrated considering the consistent quality of his output.

RATING: 6
Premier point : ce jeu est un jeu de deux à trois joueurs. Dans ces configuration, c'est un petit OVNI très subtil, mais qu'il faut essayer pour apprécier. À quatre, disons le, c'est la fête du slip : inutile d'espérer avoir pu faire quoi que ce soit d'intelligent en faisant dix coups sur toute la partie. Et comme le jeu n'est pas bien rigolo à la base, ben y a plus trop d'intérêt : on pousse du pion et on croise les doigts.

Si vous aimez le petit jeu du « devinez ma couleur », vous pouvez aussi regarder du côté d'[gameid=382], qui a le mérite de très bien fonctionner jusqu'à sept joueurs et d'avoir une mise en place quasi instantanée (le gros point noir de Clans, où la mise en place est presque aussi longue que le jeu lui-même).

Cold, mathematical and abstract, but good, or at least not that bad; Leo Collovini's style.  Players have a secret color and move pawns through the board to adjacent spaces with at least one pawn.  When no adjacent space fulfill this condition, a city is formed and it's scored according with the color of the pawns that are in and the season.

Colovini ujabb gyongyszeme. Nekem nagyon hasonlitott a Mauer Bauer jatekara (tudom ez hamarabb elkeszult de csak most ismerkedtem meg vele). Mindenkinek vagy egy titkos favorit szine amit probal a legelokelobb helyre eljuttatni a ponttablan. Figyelni kell, hogy a bonuszokat a legjobban kihasznalja az ember es a tobbiek szineit olyan helyekre szoritsa ahol esetleg meg pontot sem kapnak a kiertekesnel. Gyors kis porgos jatek.

Yet another area control game that I am not particularly good at.  Still, I very much enjoy trying to ensure that my huts become the predominant species.  So far, I tend to have more fun killing off groups than letting them survive, despite this not appearing to be a particularly good strategy.

An abstract game plus. The "plus" part being that no one knows your colour until the end of the game. This adds a gaming aspect to what would otherwise be a dry abstract. But that "plus" makes all the difference. I find the game somewhat chaotic (maybe I'll find strategy over time or maybe with different numbers of players) but very fascinating.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Clans -- I don't typically enjoy abstracts, but while I consider Clans essentially abstract, I find that its rapid tactical play and short game duration transform strategy from ponderous to invigorating

My inclination is to help myself while I avoid harming others -- In words more specific to this game, I want to move my own pieces to positions where they can garner points, and when I cannot pair my own pieces (for immunity from "strife"), I try to prevent strife from striking by eliminating a fifth color from near my single huts.  

But it seems to me that benevolence alone will not win this game.  One must additionally prevent opponents from scoring (or scoring [i]well[/i]).  In the early game, this may mean jeopardizing my own standing by ensuring all five colors remain near a territory to make strife possible.  In the later part of the game (when anonymity is no longer more valuable than the epoch bonuses) I'll usually try to make sure my color has a twin in its territory.

Of course, the "favorable" territory type is where one can really accumulate points.  In favorable (or [i]soon[/i]-to-be-favorable) territories where I have no presence, I'm free to empty them before they score bonus points.  If I can empty the territory by moving the huts to an "unfavorable" territory, all the better.  If, in doing so, I form a village, which cannot score -- Woohoo!

Behind the simple components of this game hides an engaging experience that is rather abstract, yet involves players throughout the 30 minutes of gameplay. The hidden roles in this game are a well-integrated facet that keeps players guessing up until the end. Solid design!

RATING: 6
Another abstract from Colovini.This time, players are assigned a secret clan colour (not sure it fits the theme) and have to shift pieces around the board in order to isolate them (Bridges of Shangri-La Style) in to score.The trick is in setting up the board to score and trying to take as many scoring pieces as possible. The secret roles don't really help as it just makes the extra scoring points more valuable.I like how the game ebs and flows but ultimately, it's just a little dry and themeless for my liking.

We've only played this one twice.  I would guess that it's best with 2 or 3 players, as with more it would appear that you don't have enough control over events to really shape the outcome.  

Thus far, strategy seems to go into two phases: 1, chop off tracts of land that have the right mix of huts your looking for and 2, control when and where the resulting village is formed, manuvering for the honor of finishing the village and the benefits or penalties of terrain.

I seem to like this more than anyone else in our house or my gaming group.  I love trying to keep which colour you are not so obvious while at the same time positioning yourself to win the game.

First 2 plays with 2 players and I really like it. The secret identity gives a very nice edge. When moving the huts it creates a lot of tension when you try to not let the opponent gain a good opportunity but yet at some point you might not have another choice. 
This is one of those mid length, mid weight games that I love so much: easy to learn (a bit tricky albeit quick to teach) but with a good amount of strategic depth yet it doesn't break your brain. It is a very thinky game, which is nice to have in the collection. 
I noticed in our 3 player game today that with trying to be secretive the table talk is more limited and everybody is more lost in thought. That might not be everyone's thing, I wouldn't want every game to be like that, but I am fine with it here. 3 players play just as well as 2.

[u]Key Words:[/u] Prehistoric - Secret Player Colors - Abstract Strategy - 2-4 Players - 30mins

[u]Summarized Opinion:[/u] Very nice though sometimes chaotic abstract. Deceptively difficult.

[u]My Rating Explained:[/u] Very good game. I love to play it.

[u]Verbose Assessment:[/u]

Very interesting abstract where players manipulate pieces on the board without the other players knowing which color you represent.

There are only a few rules, so the game is easy to teach, but there's so much going on underneath the surface that play stays intriguing. Add to that the fact that you would like to find out what colors your opponents are playing [i]and[/i] are trying to hide your own color, and you have a difficult nail-biter on your hands.

Down-side is that it can get quite chaotic, especially with 3 or 4 players, which means that not necessarily the best player will win.

This would probably work well with 2. With bigger groups, the hidden player colours are irrelevant because basically any colour scoring points is bad for you.

In the 2 games I've played, the player that has made no effort to hide their colour has won.

A great idea that doesn't quite work for me, though as I said, with 2 this might play very differently.

After many plays, I now enjoy this game quite a bit.  I think it's the designer's best.  When I received the game, it was missing a bit.  So, being that I lived in Africa at the time, I carved it out of some local wood with a pocket knife and painted it green.  It doesn't look quite right and my friend ended up calling the game Glans as it looks like, um...

This is a nice game with a short playing time, so it can be fit into a game night easily.  I think the "hidden color" aspect of the game is a lot of fun.  Players generally try to make ambiguous plays at first before others have figured out their color.  It's pretty fun, and plays very quickly.

Clever little abstract strategy game of merging huts to form villages.  The premise is very simple but there is quite a bit of strategy that comes into play.  By taking turns moving one hut, or group of huts, at a time you try to outscore your opponents by cleverly manipulating which villages contain your huts and which do not.  Also, your color is known only to you until the end which allows for more deceptiveness.  All in all, an enjoyable 15 to 20 minute game.  Good for a starter for a game night.  With 2 players I suppose it would be a good battle of wits, but with 3 or 4 (which is all I've done), just about anyone can win.

I was very intrigued by the movement mechanism.  I kept on waiting for the strategic options to open up to me -- it seemed like they would.  I played a number of times and I ended up feeling like I just had very little control.  I still feel like I am missing some key to understanding how to play the game. Neat idea that somehow didn't work for me.

RATING: 7.5
This is a fun, multi-player, abstract game. Its simple rules and simple game play, yet deep tactical nature, make it accessible to nearly everyone. I can bring it out with a group of casual gamers and they aren't intimidated by it. Likewise, I can bring it out with a group of heavy gamers, and they'll see it as an enjoyable snack between main courses.

Some of my favorite aspects of it are the way the bonus scoring works in the different regions. There's a constantly ticking timing element. You may want to try to set up some long-term plays for the later rounds. And if you're trying to put things together for the current epoch, it's usually a tense race to get your village built in time for the bonus. Trying to strike the balance with both long-term and short-term play makes for a gripping experience.

The hidden player colors adds a great little twist. It might be too easy to go after a player if it weren't for that. This essentially eliminates king-making, or ganging up on any one player. Quite genius, actually.

High remarks for such a little game. I recommend it for most gamers, newbies or veterans alike.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I like Colovini's games. He makes abstracts that are not perfect information brain burners. The reason this one works so well for me is that each players clan color is kept secret. This keeps things moving quickly as you are not sure who you are helping/hurting besides yourself. If this were not the case playtime would double and I would not have any fun.

Travel Suitability:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 4
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 3
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 4
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 3


Overall - 3.5

This game is very difficult to understand at first.  The rules are simple, but the strategy is well hidden.  4-player games are especially difficult.  But as I've started understanding the game it's gotten better each time.  We'll see if it continues in that vein.

RATING: 7
A cute near-abstract about creating and scoring isolated villages by slowly moving huts around on a board. The movement and village creation mechanic is wonderful and simple and the play with hidden player colours adds a neat twist to this 20-30 minute medium-heavy filler. Nicely avoids paralysing people while still offering lots of choices.

Acquired in a trade.

A bit abstracty if you will but the changing of the favored/nonfavored land types is pretty cool. Very simple mechanics, very deep game. 

As it is vastly an abstract game there really is no reason this doesn't fit perfectly for 2 players perhaps even best with.

Fun, quick game that combines relatively simple rules, with a mix of strategy and luck, along with an interesting bluffing twist.  The randomly assigned color that isn't revealed until the end mechanic is unique in my collection, and makes this a worthwhile, if not outstanding, game.

A LoFi (low overhead/high interaction) gem. Occupies an interstitial between an abstract & deductive mind-fuck. Just delicious.

Give this one some time, while I saw the idea of it right away it took me nearly 10 plays to get past the opacity & really see it. So play some back to back - it's quick - in a series of sittings & give it a full airing. Climb the skill ladder with the same table if you can.

One must cross one's eyes to see the board & how to create parasitical formations without giving away who you are. Or at least picking your moment for the reveal. All about setting up forks, passing moves that give you information while advancing you positionally, and the best is having someone else makes your winning move. Which really creates some jaw dropping endgames.

I rated this well to start, but it is becoming one of my favorite games. And so quick! It's great to play back to back.

Game in which your main purpose is to guess your opponents' colours and conceal yours as long as possible. Quite an abstract game with little or no theme. Suprisingly enough, I find this game more enjoyable with two players than most of the games I played that were created specifically for two. Also works great with three, less so with four (when it becomes quite a lot more chaotic). Played 10+ times.

Played on BSW and once for real.  I had heard alot about it, and both expected to like it and was worried it would be too dry and abstract.  It was pretty abstract, but I didn't really mind when I was playing.  This is a nice little game.  It didn't take very long and while I knew the rules, I had no idea what I was doing.  I hope I find it as interesting when I start to understand the strategy.

Has promise, but it hasn't yet stood out to me.  The strategy doesn't seem as deep and rewarding as some other simple abstract games.  But perhaps I am just missing it.

When I was taught this game, as soon as the explanation was done, I said something like "I can tell that I'm not going to know what's going on until at least halfway through this game."  I was right, as scoring is somewhat difficult to fathom on the first play.  The idea of each player's color being hidden is a neat one.  Suffers some problems with left-right binding, particularly in games with more players.  Still, this game is nice and fast, and definitely has a place as filler.  Not really to my taste, but a good game for fans of slightly more abstract mechanics.

Nice game. It is simple and elegant. Has  some unique mechanics to it. The theme to mechanics link is quite good here I think. The players represent tribes in prehistoic times. The tribes try to cluster together to increase their chances of survival. But if all the tribes in the game are clustered together then strife takes place with bad consequences (people couldn't get along even in those days I guess !!!!)

Can certainly be used as a gateway game that will get the new players thinking in no time.

More control at 2-3 players. There are some issues with "player on your left setting you up" like puerto rico and samurai and some king making issues. Both of these get worse at 4. But, I still don't mind it at 4.

Typically good Colovini abstract that's great with two, still good with three, and not recommended with four. The key to winning is early bluffing and misdirection to throw your opponents off which color you are, combined with strong deduction that allows you to ignore their bluffs.

With experience, you can avoid situations where you set up an opponent turn after turn, letting him create villages and racking up the bonus chips.

Played a few times face-to-face and on BSW. It has simple rules and nice ideas, but something - I do not know what - seems to be missing to make it a great game. The parity problem might be an issue with 2 players - or maybe it is a part of the design.

This is 2-4 players, but don't play it with 4.  Works best as a 2-player game; still good with 3 players of equal ability.

I am usually not a huge fan of abstract strategy, but Clans is a lot of fun. I like games with a "secrecy" factor, and discovering the colors of your opponents is a great part of this game. My gf and I play this a lot.

An engaging multi-player abstract. with a bonus that it actually, kinda, fits the theme. Hidden player color works very well. Suffers a bit from "best to be on the left of the worst player" and analysis agony (not full-on paralysis), but still quick and fun.

How can a game this simple hurt my brain as much as it does?  From now on I'll only play two games in a row...by the third game I start to "out clever" myself.  Very popular with my group.

I'm impressed by the depth of this little game. You can play in 20 minutes, but is way more thinky than most other 20-minute games

OK abstract game. Better with fewer players, as more colors are up for grabs. Don't play this for the theme.

Kinda fun... I guess... A little bluffing, a little deduction... And it's colorful. It's also pretty short. However, it's not interesting enough for me (in comparison to many other games in my collection). Only game my sister has ever beat me in... twice...

What a shame this one flies beneath the radar for so many people.  OK looking game from a smaller publisher with nice bits.  The mechanic of not finding out which players correspond to various colors is both unique and fun.  Hard to get a handle on some kind of overall strategic plan early in the game, but still a lot of fun trying to get your opponent to reveal themself or sacrifice an advantage in the game to avoid it.

Excellent abstract game.  I have only played with two players and don't know how it plays with more.  I enjoy the hidden aspect and trying to deduce what color the other player is.

Nice looking, quick playing strategy game. I can see why it garners such great reviews -- it is a solid game and is easy to teach newcomers. After a while, though, the game feels a bit repetitive and empty -- the first half dozen moves carry little weight, and only the end game has much riding on each action.

One of those rare commodities, a game that is easy to teach and quick to play, but has a lot of strategy. It's got a possible kingmaker problem though.

I thought I'd like this game more than I do. It's quick, has a bit of strategy, but not a lot of fun packed into the box. The hidden identities seem more bothersome than mysterious.

Very abstract and quick... but maybe more frustrating than fun.  Hidden player colors and larger numbers of players led to more chaos than I was expecting.  Perhaps this will feel more strategic with more plays or less people.  Either way its still a decent, good looking filler.

Interesting and elegant mechanics. Game play is quick, but becomes more chaotic with more players. Having a hut in the last few villages seems to be very important.

Pretty abstract, but then again, what do you expect from Colovini?  It's not a bad little game for its length and weight.  Actually, it's pretty good.  Maybe I shouldn't have traded away my copy?  Ah, I can always trade for it again.

Thank you Secret Santa (from my wife - crystallr - and I)!!!

Played on 2/17 as a two player for the first time.  It works pretty well.  I blew it in the end and handed her the game.  She won by one point.

I would say the complaints about it being difficult to set up are unfounded.  It goes quickly especially if two or more people are helping, each one placing a single color at a time.

Cute colorful bluff game. We like to guess out loud other players color when they make their move; intimidation is always a must in a bluffing game!

RATING: 7
After 2+ Plays: The mechanics of the hut movement would be pretty boring, but the secret player colors really make this worth playing.  The on-their-own uninteresting mechanics actually serve the game quite well, because they allow you to consistently score multiple colors and thus obscure your true allegiance.

Non-luck multiplayer game that I never can seem to win. Game starts with 1 pawn each of 5 colours in 60 lands, and a player's turn is to move all pawns in one land to an adjacent land that has at least one pawn. Effectively, lands will be abandoned, and when a land is "isolated", each colour in the land scores as many points as there are pawns in the land. Except if there are all 5 colours, in which case all single pawns are removed prior to scoring. Certain land types improve or decrease score. What colour the players represent is hidden until the game is over.

Some good plays, some bad plays. It really depends on the others, whether they know the tactics or just move around. Is maybe best as a 2-player game.

Tu color es secreto. Mueve chozas a regiones ocupadas adyacentes. Cuando una región esté aislada puntúa según cuantas chozas tiene y el tipo de terreno en el que están (el monto del bono depende del avance en la partida).

interesting, but i think I still give earlier epic renditions a slight edge over this one, although applying some of the mechanics of this game (blast markers, strategy & initiative rolls) to the old game and you might have quite possibly the best epic scale game EVER!

I have great fondness for this game after getting it on... maybe my 12th birthday. Painted a lot of dudes, made a lot of terrain, and still a bit sad that it was likely tossed in a great bedroom purge while I was away at college. 

Don't remember much about the game itself but ooh! Little tanks and huge alien bugs!

This is the true mass-battles-system for the 40K universe (Apocalypse is a dud), and if I had the time for playing with miniatures today, I'd really play this one.

RATING: 7
Epic 40K is still the best sci-fi battle game that GW has ever produced. LOTS and LOTS of units make that the dice-rolling mechanics of the game are still very tactical. Units move fast over an enormous field, and this makes for a very tactical game, contary to GW's other static, slow and cumbersome battle games.

The new rules (3rd edition I believe) have taken the best from the two past editions and have made it once again to a great game (if you like miniaturegames). 40K is probably the better game of the two but the feeling of being a _commander_ is superior in Epic.

RATING: 6
Riddled with flaws, bad rules, GW-isms, garish concepts/designs with a sweet sweet nostalgia candy center that still brings a smile to my face. The golden years of high school gaming blind to GW atrocities. The rules were so unstructured and filled with loopholes and balance issues that it was really amazing we ever played the game at all. I guess the epic scale and sci-fi theme struck a chord. We played this game into the ground and probably only stopped playing as one member of group found the nearly unbeatable combo, effectively killing the fun. Way to go Jopa!

Supposedly future versions eliminated some of the rules flaws, but the GW-isms remain and none of us ever  were able to get others back after turning our back on the pariah of the industry.

Wonderful eyeshot with all those painted minis on the table, but really, really poor play.
I grow up with wargames and then I got hooked into GW games, mainly because I loved painting and collecting miniatures, so I liked all of this stuff, literally. But after playing Epic recently I discovered that all that enjoyment is almost gone now: I don't mind anymore to bash enemies by superior firepower and long range barrage, and have developed a strong dislike vs. games whose only genius is throwing handfuls of dice for 6s.

Space Marine 2nd Edition had a little too much chrome for me, and I liked the abstract ways of Epic40K.

Good game - ranges a bit too short, but I loved the supression rules, making it worth firing at units if only to reduce their efficency if you can't kill things.

But like GW products - too expensive, it took me 3 years to paint up the IMperials and Orks, then it went out of print and I never got to play more than 2 games.

Sad really.

Man I loved the epic 40k rules...  it's listed both as 'owned' and 'previously owned' because I'm truly not sure how much of my army still lurks in boxes in my basement - probably only a fraction, sadly.  Still, would love to re-enter this game, and maybe someday I'll find the time and money to do so.  OK, not likely, but maybe!!  :)

I really liked this edition.  Even the biggest, baddest titan in the game can be brought down by the massed fire of average units.  This one had much less of the "special rules crutch", with more emphasis on actual game tactics.

ONE of my first GW products.  This is the minature..and I do mean minature version of 40k.  This system was a big improvement over the original.  Game runs more smoothly and units are more genaric.  the new command rules allow you to focus on strategy quite a bit.

I still play it to this day.  My kids have grown to an age where they have discovered the strategies and fun of the system and have parties with their friends for EPIC battles.  

I have amassed huge armies which has reaqlly paid off because its a game that gets the kids off of video games and challenges their minds and they can invite friends to play and their 'cool dad' has everything needed to play!

A lot of players trash Epic 40k for one reason or another, particularly veteran Epic players who started out in Space Marine v1 and v2. Generally it comes down to the assumption that the game is too watered down or abstract, based on the simplified unit stats. In reality, its actually a complicated and unforgiving game, and if I had to introduce a new player to Epic, it would be Epic Space Marine v2, not Epic 40,000. Space Marine is by far an easier game to grasp.

The one thing I really like about Epic 40k is the army lists. There isnt an Epic model that was released prior that isnt either in the army books that come with the game (Space Marines, Imperial Guard, Orks, Eldar, Chaos, and Tyranid) or Firepower magazine (Squats, Knights, Tau, and other randoms). Thats a huge assortment of miniatures to choose from. And because the flexibility of the lists, you can make detachments/armies from leftovers in your bitz box, and not forced to have 6 Space Marine stands and 3 Rhinos to make up a formation for example. It means some detachments look more like mobs, but the room for creativity is there.

Positives include better air support rules than previously released, as well as simple but nice War Engine rules. And infantry are a lot tougher now too, especially when in cover. The affect of firepower on a detachment is also interesting element. 

But that being said, while I like Epic 40,000, I can see why others don't. Lack of model individuality, lack of atmosphere, firepower and assault charts, unforgiving assaults who's outcome is determined by a single dice roll, all have their merits. Its almost like the game's logic was designed more for a computer game than a table-top game. But you can also rationalize everything that happens in a game, even winning an assault while losing more models. The starter set is probably the best Epic set ever released though in terms of minis, terrain, and components. There is more 'game' in this box set than any other Epic game (and the Epic Armageddon rules didn't even have a box set).

I like all the versions of Epic for different reasons, and Epic 40,000 is a well done game in its right, its just very different.

RATING: 4
Warhammer Epic 40k was my attempt to delve into the 40k universe, but I didn't like the game, so it didn't get played more than once or twice. The miniatures were just too tiny, so painting them was such a hassle. Also the gameplay was not all that great and the high price point of the game was too much for me, since I was already invested into Warhammer Fantasy, so I actually stuck to that in the end. Also I always preferred fantasy settings to science fiction in the first place.

I didn't mind this game, it allowed the use of spectacular armies, though they were difficult to paint being so small. The main flaw of this was that it wasn't as well supported as the other franchises which is a shame. Still, it remains a good game, it just takes absolutely ages to set up!

One of the best tabletop miniature games from GW. It plays great, good rules, awesome minis, excellent. Especially the new Epic Armageddon.

RATING: 6
An attempt to modernize the epic scale line. Surprisingly modern rules, given that it's GW. Perhaps the cool reception it received tells us why the GW flagship lines (40K, Fantasy Battle) still remain much as they were when they were first made in the 80s.

Epic 40K abstracted the units relative to the level of detail in its predecessor, Space Marine. It also included suppression rules, more open army building and some other modern distinctions that didn't sell too well.

One of the best of the mass combat miniatures games from Games Workshop - better rules than either Warhammer or Warhammer 40k in my opinion.  The larger number of smaller figures give a much more epic feel to the battles as well.  Unfortunately, the cost of entry is very high - even given that it's a miniatures game.

Fairly simple sci-fi mass wargame.  It suffers from a few problems; some units were simplified too much from the previous version, and firefights and close combats run into issues, but it was probably the smoothest playing of the versions of epic.

I hesitated for a long time before getting hold of this game via ebay. I must say that i have been pleasantly surprised. 

I really like the huge battles that can be fought using these rules, yes the rules are slightly generic and abstract, but it plays well, its clean and uncluttered. a big game can be played in an evening.

I really like the way the armies are put together, the player has pretty much total control over what makes up the detachments in the army, unlike earlier editions of the rules where armies were purchased using army cards...

Why this game failed I really don't know....

I love this game, but sadly I haven't played this for a loong time. This should probably deserve rating of 8.

Yep. The third edition. The one nobody liked. Except me and a handful of others around the globe. A secret brotherhood, if you will. Still quietly playing this in supposedly abandoned bunkers and derelict homes. Rolling the dice on velvet to keep the noise down, lest the legions of NetEpic and Epic:Armageddon fans detect their presence and pelt them to death with tiny lead tanks. 

Seriously, it's good.

Clever dice-pool management game with lovely custom dice. The rulebook is very confusing for what is a very simple game. There are lots of decisions to be made on a player's turn and much chaining/combo-ing can be done so turns can take a while. In a four player game, the downtime between turns is excessive. I think this is a great 2 player game, but it doesn't scale well at all.

A Yahtzee variant with some Lehmannesque touches.  As in To Court The King, there is a choice of dice combinations to aim for each turn and those combinations get progressively more difficult.  Ciub adds a couple of twists; the first is drawing from pools of different coloured dice with different combinations of numbers and icons, the second is the way your set of dice is regularly reduced to five.  The result is that you are always assembling a set to give you the best chance of achieving a the next  combination.  My one play was with four.  The down time was significant and it felt as though the game dragged.  With two or three I could see this being quite diverting.  

Production quality is decent.  The player mats that tell you nearly everything you need to know are a nice touch.

Unfortunately it is the only Lehmann game I've played that I didn't enjoy. I dislike the fact that there is no development since you are obligated to return to 5 dice after purchasing a spell. Other people have enjoyed the game.

Nice little dice game. Production is a bit lousy but the game itself is great. Randomness is mitigated by using the purple/blue/green control dice; which are really cool. Even if you don't get a card on your turn, you get a free die, which will serve you better the next one. Awesome little game that is overlooked due to it being so light and not readily available in the US.

Initial Impressions:
-----------------------
This one is a bit finicky, but once you get the hang of it its a pretty neat dice game.  I think its really a 2-3p game, since the downtime in a 4p game is a bit high.  For being a dice game, this one is a bit thinky, and I thought it was neat.  Looking forward to trying it at 2/3 players!

A bunch of custom dice and powers, and it should have been amazing. But, the way that you need to plan for future turns, while making the game unique, also seems to make the game drag. A 7 that felt like it should have been a 9.

Kockadobás a köbön. Ezt a játékot egy kockapókerhez tudnám hasonlítani teljesen más köntösbe bújtatva. Nekem tetszett bár szerintem igen hosszú a játék 4 játékossal, mire mindenki kivárja, hogy a másik mit dob. Természetesen meg van a maga egyedisége amiért érdemes elővenni. Az eligazító tábla szépen kidolgozott, a kártyák is hangulatosak. Mint minden kockás játéknak egy hatalmas szerencsefaktor adatott ennek is, de mégis lehet javítani az esélyeken a különböző kockakollekciók kiváltásával. Kik szeretik a kockapókerhez hasonló játékokat, mindenképpen ajánlott.

Nice abstract (bland theme) dice game from Tom Lehmann.
In every turn you try to fullfill 1 form 5 dice Combos, which earns you VP. Some Dice let you choose to trade dice, with other sides (possibilities)
There is enough control that the smarter Player wins, but a Little luck is needed.
Thumbs up and good Job from Lehmann.

Just read the rules.  Looks like a cute dice game.  Reminds me a little of Lehman's To Court the King.  Not that the gameplay is similar but I suspect it will be a light filler that is more fun than expected.  Still, it's one where I'll be happy to play someone else's copy.  At this point, I don't see any reason to own it.

RATING: 9
Really surprised by the negative comments here so far, since I am quite enjoying Ciub and find it very clever. It's very strategic for a dice game; it's much less of a straight category game (a la Yahtzee) than To Crown a King or Roll Through the Ages. This is much more about managing your dice pool as you navigate through the spells: sometimes you can become highly specialized if there are a few spells that are related and can be knocked off in order, but most of the time you want to become just specialized enough to knock off an immediate goal, then fall back enough to retain enough flexibility to target something new. You need to keep an eye out for related pairs of spells that you can target with your pool. Knowing when to back out to white dice is really crucial, and most players don't do it enough - it's easy to get tunnel vision and get focussed on what you can do with the specialized dice pool you have even when there isn't anything really great available, and the right answer to back a few dice back out to white so you can pivot. White dice suck for most specific goals, but they have a 1/3rd chance of swapping out for something specifically useful, that swap lets you reroll without locking a die, and so they provide really important flexibility. Managing the "special power" dice (green, blue, purple) is tricky, and like in To Crown a King it's easy to overcommit to dice-twiddling powers that leave you short the raw number of dice you need to match to claim spells.

Anyway, it's a dice game, so it's chaotic and not super-deep, but there is a lot of clever nuance here and the game plays really easily once you get what it's doing. As dice games aimed a little bit more at the hobbyist go, this is one of the most interesting. Doing a non-trivial and interesting dice game is actually a notoriously hard problem, with lots of entrants but also lots of schlock; even classics like Can't Stop or Liar's Dice are not of that much interest to the discriminating gamer. Even Roll Through the Ages, a good game which I helped work on, is still missing something. I am optimistic that Ciub has what it takes, and can join Knizia's The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey series, Ra: The Dice Game, and ICE's fascinating if somewhat overwrought Dicemaster.

Unlike Favour of the Pharaoh, there's no sense of escalation in this game, only an undulation between having many dice and few dice. Still, the different dice and their powers make this worth playing every now and then.

After playing a couple more times, I can see that tactics comes into play very interestingly in the way of aiming and securing spells.

RATING: 4
A somewhat annoying dice comboing game where the objective is simply to roll an objective before the rules, stipulating that per roll one die must either be put aside or swapped (if you roll a symbol indicating that you may), force you to end your turn. If you succeed you get VP and have to reduce the number of dice to 5; if you don't, you pick an extra die from the stock subject to a few limitations on their amount and colour.

Frankly I disliked the semi-endless comboing until the rules force you to stop. The combinations you need to attain just necessitate more dice; there is no special ability here. The only thing which might make it a bit more interesting is the 5 VP bonus for uncovering the final card. This creates some welcome end of game jockeying as 5 VP is nothing to be scoffed at... but we're dealing with dice, and if they don't cooperate a well-executed planning strategy can still come to naught. Naturally over the course of many games you'd expect sound strategy to carry victory more often than not, but that supposes that you actually [i]play[/i] often. And that is something I'm not entirely sure of. It is annoying for the other players as they just sit around and wait for things to come to an inevitable halt. The system just didn't engage me in any way, so speaking for myself I am not likely to put in the effort to familiarise myself with it more intimately. That all said, surreptitious dice fondlers are probably served well by this title.

I pronounce the game 'tsjoop', by the way, as in Dutch this is an apt sound to make when spurring someone to make a short, brisk movement... like say, a flourishing dice roll.

Components: Chunky dice with clear iconography. Fun artwork on the dice cards, though they are mostly obscured by the dice. The game is basically themeless; I think it could have done a lot more to make the objectives thematic.

Experience: Fun yahtzee-style game, with more rolling options, and special powers from dice. It's fun to adjust my dice pool based on the objective I'm going for.

I would have enjoyed my one play of this MUCH MUCH more if the person teaching the game knew the rules (duh!) and if we had not played with 4 players.  There is too much downtime with 4 players.  This is the bane of all Yahtzee style dice games.  But with that said, I'd love to play it again with fewer players.  It seems like the type of game that I would enjoy with 2 or three players.

Egyszerű, aránylag gyors kockajáték. Kicsit olyan, mintha a qwixx és a quarriors szerelemgyereke lenne.

5 alap kockából álló készlete van mindenkinek. A körödben annyiszor dobhatsz velük ahányszor szeretnél, de minden dobásnál legalább egyet félre kell tenned az aktívak közé. Node miért dobálunk: hát azért, hogy különböző célokat teljesítsünk, amik kártyák formájában vannak az asztal közepén. Mondjuk valami ilyesmi: 2,2,5,7. Igen 7.
Ha sikerül megdobni valamelyiket, akkor elteheted. De hogy lehet hetest dobni? Már az alap készletben sem átlagos kockák vannak, ráadásul van még 5 féle másik kocka is. Ezeken mind számok és speciális akciók (újradobás, beforgatás, új kocka szerzés stb.) vannak. A számok 1-7 közöttiek, de mindegyik kocka speciális, pl. van olyan, amin csak páratlan számok vannak, valamin jellemzően nagyobb számok, vannak amin sok az akció, kevés a szám. Új kockát szerezni akkor lehet, ha nem sikerült egyik célkártyát sem teljesíteni vagy kockák spéci akcióival. Azonban nem növelheted a készleted végletekig: amint elviszel egy célkártyák, vissza kell menned 5 kockára. Van még egy-két kisebb csavar, de a ennyi a lényeg.

Meg kell, hogy mondjam, hogy ledöbbentem, mikor megláttam az átlagértékelését. Szerintem egyáltalán nem rossz játék. Persze van benne szerencse bőven, de hát senki se számíthat másra az 50-60 kocka láttán a doboz kinyitása után. Bőven van min gondolkodni, kombózni, attól függően, hogy éppen milyen készleted van és azzal melyik célokra van reális esélyed. Ha meg éppen semmire sincs, akkor hogyan van értelme továbblépni, hogy legyen. Annak ellenére, hogy nincs rajta fantasy cukormáz, szerintem jobb játék, mint a Quarriors.

Nálam 6.7, játszanék vele bármikor, ha előkerül valahol.

Hmm, there's something I like more about this than To Court the King. I like that the target is moving. You have constantly adjust and prepare for the next spells. You're doing more than building the engine, you're forced to adapt and reconfigure it. It makes the game dynamic. The dice are nice, but they could have upped the quality of the other components, namely the placemats.

Highly tactical Yahtzee variant with 7 different types of dice: some dice roll high, some low, some roll even numbers only, some only odd numbers. Some dice grant special actions like free re-rolls or trading a die for a different one. Players build their own set of dice while trying to roll for the various combos. Excellent implementation and definitely much better than Elder Sign or Quarriors.

A solid middle-weight game. I think that those people who complain that the game is too light are missing something -- there are a lot of interesting decisions to make each turn in managing your dice pool for the current turn and future turns. Sure, it's a dice game, and that means luck, but there are ways to mitigate your bad luck, and that's essentially what the game is about. Making good decisions will help you win; making bad ones will lose you the game for certain. Unless Lady Luck takes a shine to you, that is.

I'll just start by saying I really don't like Yahtzee-type dice games. Lehmann's To Court the King bored me and I have not been motivated to seek out the revamped Favor of the Pharaoh. 

To Court the King had players progressing along an ever more difficult list of combos to unlock dice and gain points and benefits. In Ciúb, the pyramid is replaced with increasingly difficult goal cards that only give you points and the special abilities are scattered throughout 7 different colors of dice. As in all of these games, you roll a handful of dice and have to save at least one before you re-roll. Your basic dice have numbers 1-4 and two swap symbols. When you roll a swap, you can trade it for another color and keep rolling it. Different colors have different number ranges and special abilities that allow you to fix numbers, trade one die for two different-colored dice, and re-roll. Some dice also have skulls that, of course, cannot be re-rolled. When a combo-goal is hit a card is claimed and new one takes its place with ever-more demanding requirements. If you can't claim a card, you get to add a die and roll more in the next round. When you do claim a card, you have to discard back down to 5 dice. The game ends when you've worked through the goal deck.

I think I liked this one more because it it had the feel of a dice-management game just as much as a combo-rolling game. Certain goals can only be met using certain dice and you and have to spend turns sometimes evolving the dice in your dice pool into the dice you need. You can always have one goal card reserved for yourself so that your evolution can't be deemed worthless after working towards it. The choice of special dice gives you more options and decision points than Yahtzee-variants generally do and I appreciated that. I'd play this one again.

I've only read the rules (Sept 17 2014).

Light dice game which is similar to 'To Court the King'. The acquisition of new cards is similar in both games, you need to have four-of-a-kind, X+ number of pips, etc...

The big difference is that the cards you acquire only give you victory points, they don't offer new dice or abilities. Instead, it's the dice themselves which give you abilities like re-roll or setting a die to any chosen face. There are several types of dice distinguished by colour which have different distributions. White dice, which have a swap symbol allowing you to trade the white die for another. Blue dice, which are the 'magic' dice allowing you to choose the face of another die, re-roll, swap, and a skull result which must be put aside. There are 7 types of dice in total and many of the faces simply show numbers ranging from 1 to 6. You have unlimited rerolls, but each time you must set aside at least one die.

If you fail to gain a spell card then you gain a die of your choice and keep your die pool for the next round. If you succeed then you discard down to 5 dice. Although there is an ability to trade one die for two others which resolves after you discard down to 5. So the game is largely one of die pool management. Trying to gain spell cards while keeping your pool of dice relevant for the next round.

I'm looking forward to trying it.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

I found it interesting but am uncertain how much replay value exists. I'd also encourage at least the first play or two to be exclusively 2-3 player as the downtime can be monotonous since there is some decision making in play. I kept it simple on my first play keeping to a single strategy and mostly orange dice with a blue dice or two to complement my rolls focusing on 2s for the most part and discarding cards like mad from the top row of the display if they were not something I could accomplish.

I think I like dice games, but too often I don't like dice games. That is, I definitely like dice, but I often don't like what's done with them in games. I've tried a bunch and there's usually just something missing, and often it's the notion that having other people at the table makes a difference. Ciub, with its dumb name, is a good effort.

It's by Tom Lehmann, who also made the execrable To Court the King, a game as fun as watching someone else watch paint dry. Ciub is definitely better in that the dice manipulation doesn't get stupidly out of hand, and has a more interesting goal. Unlike TCTK, even though someone else's turn doesn't affect me too much, it's still fun to watch them pushing their luck and egging them on. Luck and the dice still play a big part in the game, even to the end; it's not a game about making dice less random. I also like the constant dice management that happening, and the fact that no single color of die is objectively better; moving back to the starting white dice is not necessarily a downgrade (though the blue dice seem objectively bad compared to others). 

I like that Ciub is a dice game that doesn't seem to be embarrassed about having dice or seem like it wants to reassure people who don't like dice that they'll like it too. If you can't deal with randomness, don't play it; it's not going to coddle you.

This is the experience I wanted, and did not get, from King's Forge.  Lots of rerolling and dice manipulation, as opposed to moving dice around for 15 minutes and then, THUNK, "What'd I get?"

RATING: 5
Complex yahtzee for filling tickets before the other players get to them.

The structure of the rules is very confusing: Takes quite some deciphering to figure out how the game is supposed to be played. The German rules are slightly more precise than the English ones but the problem is mainly structural, i.e. the semi-narrative style, poor organization, and giant-wall-of-text layout. A lot of this could be fixed just by using a more structured layout, i.e. clearly dividing phase 2 into separate subphases (emphasized by boxes, dividers, etc.), and by reorganizing and clarifying the end of the phase in order to spell out in very fine detail A) how dice move between hand, bowl, and stock B) how and which dice are locked C) how and what can be rerolled to restart the phase. Also, the "2 for 1" die face should not have been included within phase 2 at all, it is just an unnecessary distraction there.

The player board tries to fix some of this but fails by presenting phase 3 incorrectly, by not spelling out that phase 2 can be repeated, and by having some inaccurate text descriptions as well.

Components are on the cheap side: cardstock quality is low, and player boards are just paper. The dice are nice, though.

[i]I played this the same night as Discoveries and looking back it just didn't do anything to stand out. I honestly don't remember much from a game play perspective, I remember enjoying it but I can say that about a lot of games. As much as I love dice games, I've tried to be a lot more selective with the ones I play and especially add to our collection. I doubt I'll ever get the opportunity to play this again and that is okay with me.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]I thought this was a really fun dice filler, unfortunately the component quality is awful (well the dice are okay). I only got to play one game and it was the short version. I'd definitely like to play more to really solidify my opinion of this one. Mat said he thought it went a bit long when you played the regular game and it suffered from downtime issues when playing with more than 2. Still I quite liked the way dice got manipulated, especially swapping out dice in order to get new dice that had different values/powers. 

I'm not sure this game has legs, but I am excited to play again even though it dropped down on my wishlist.[/i]

This is a really fun game. It's nice to figure out what dice to gather for the upcoming round. It's great how you can return to the white dice at the end of your turn so that you get the chance to swap them for new dice during the next turn.

Getting a copy of this game was a weird affair.  I don't know where I first heard about it but one day it was just on my wishlist.  I wasn't able to find it anywhere locally because there isn't a US printing.  I saw it one day for sale from a game importer and simply thought to myself "well I wanted it at some point enough to add it to my wishlist, what the hell".

After playing it I find it even stranger that I added this to the wishlist at some point.  It is another Yahtzee-style game, something I have played and owned a ton of and certainly don't think I need any more.  After playing though I find this a delightful game.

The theme is just pasted on, in the end you're just rolling dice trying to get specific combinations to claim cards for points.  Many of the cards have special symbols allowing you to re-roll or even pick the face of a die but the most interesting thing and what I think elevates it most is your ability to switch dice for other custom dice.  There are, I believe, 7 different sets of custom dice in this game each with their own combination of different faces.

As you can imagine this game is very accessible and plays quickly as well.  This is a good filler if you're looking to roll a lot of dice.

With [thing=21632][/thing] [person=150][/person] proved that he can make compelling dice games. So I had good hopes for this game. And even though I wasn't expecting too much I was very disappointed. There simply is very little here. Cards need you to roll certain combinations. If you do you get the points, if you don't, you get an extra die. There's ways of managing your dice pool and such, but in the end it didn't live up to it's potential at all. It's not horrible, but I was hoping for just a bit more.

Sokféle kocka, bonyolult kockaváltási mechanizmusok, feladatkártyák végrehajtása, gyengécske varázslós téma. 

Nagyon nem az én világom: minden benne volt, amiért nem kedvelem a kockajátékokat.

Pound for pound my favorite of the dice-pool building games. It asks more subtle questions of the players than simply "how many dice do you want to have?" and instead offers a lot of tight, clever, and sharp options that tend to be lost on inexperienced players.

Unfortunately, as a dice game, luck plays a not insignificant factor, which sometimes blows away the cleverer corners of the game like so much spider-web. I find both that this design is deeply under-rated and is destined to remain so.

I dont know this is poorly ranked. If I just want to have fun throwing dice with non gamer friends, and not make it too easy like zombie dice... its this.

Quite unlike many bgg-style games, your engine revs and then falls back in an up-and-down fashion throughout the whole game, building from 5 to 7, 9 or 11 dice to score a reserved spell card then dropping back to 5 to plan your next attack. Gamers who enjoy the slow burn engine build of traditional euros might baulk at this approach to point scoring as the power graph undulates as opposed to shooting upwards until game end.

The translated rulebook misses a trick to help newcomers. It could be clearer on re-rolls and dice bowl placement, sometimes saying 'set aside' 'put aside' and 'put into the dicebowl' in different instances which is especially confusing when trying to understand how the single re-roll face is used. This movement of dice is crucial to the fine tuning of the rules, but at least bgg's forums are sorting this out as the game gets wider approval.

You wonder if Amigo gave the final version the editing time it deserved.

Games with convoluted systems of dice manipulation (changing faces, swapping one die for another, etc.) would be dramatically improved if they were transformed into realtime free-for-alls.  I made this half-joking comment during my first game of Ciub, but now I realize that it's true.

Ciub sessions will always drag because the game requires each individual person (one at a time) to think carefully about the options and statistical permutations that will maximize their chances of achieving a particular result. It's a recipe for downtime that also plagues To Court the King, Runebound, and any other game where players are forced to helplessly watch their opponents scratch their heads and mumble through their logistical options.

This is where cooperative games shine, I guess.  At least the logistics can be openly discussed, which gives everyone something to do every minute of the game.  In Ciub, I felt like 25% of my time was 'in game' and the other 75% was in la-la land.

Light dice game with some good components. Entertaining and sufficiently good, but (as you may expect from a dice game) quite luck-driven.

Very fun game, with slightly confusing rules.  The custom dice are nice, but the player mats are incredibly flimsy paper.

Ez a játék nekem a megtestesült chillout egy parti után. Színes kockákat dobálunk és cserélgetünk halálos nyugalommal, beszélgetünk közben, nevetgélünk és egy percig nem vesszük komolyan az egészet, miközben totálisan kikapcsolódunk. Tetszik.

Might take a bit too long, with periods of getting "stuck". There are some interesting choices here in how you set up your dice pool.

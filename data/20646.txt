RATING: 8
October 2010, After one play: lots of small of companies that grow up into majors ala 18EU.  Unlike 18EU each company grows into a major in a predefined way.  Seems like good companies (i.e. large dividends) is a better plan than high share value.  Our play was more or less free of shenanigans -- dumping a company didn't leave you with anything better to invest in.

Plays very well with four.  Then end game seemed a little drawn out, it took us a while to break the bank.  Screwing each other with tokens to break up routes seems to be mandatory.  The train rush is brutal, and can play a big role.  It seems that you will want to upgrade your trains whenever possible.

One difference with this game is that you cannot open new companies.  All the companies open at the start of the game.

I found forced mergers as an unnecessary complication. It was hard to think out what picture will emerge after them and there was more than enough factors to consider even without them. Game itself a bit too long too.

Fast paced 18xx variant, at least as far as the train development is concerned.

RATING: 4
Although I haven't played that many 18xx games, I can see myself playing more 18xx in the future for there is a lot to like.  However, there is definitely more bookkeeping than the Age of Steam system.  18xx games also take a lot longer to play than Age of Steam.  

The main downside to 18xx is that the repetitive endgame drags on for waaay too long with fewer and fewer meaningful decisions.  Basically, presidents run the same routes, no stock is purchased/dumped, and no further Trains are introduced.  Waiting around for players to "brake the bank" is not the way I want a game to end.
    
My current rating for 1824 reflects my interest in playing any of the longer titles in the 18xx system.  Since I have only played 3 different games (1824, 1848, & 1850) I really have no idea how good/bad these titles are compared to other 18xx games.  What I do know is that I get bored of 18xx around the 300 minute mark.  For that reason I prefer 1846 for it ends before that point.  

1824, 4 players, 7/27/08, 1 play!
1846, 4 players, 10/17/10, 1 play!
1850, 4 players, 11/12/10, 2 plays!

Austria - A bit opaque, and with a lot of moving parts early on, the game is nonetheless engaging and interesting. A bit dated.

1 playing with 5.  Similar to 18EU with basically everything being a minor to start but without the messy minor auction and different formation rules.  Very well put together, lots of things to do, and quite enjoyable.  I don't know that I enjoyed it as much as 18EU, but I suspect that is due in part to having played 18EU much more and in part to the much lower quality of the components, one of my issues with the Orgler/Ohley games.

RATING: 7
Interesting variation, but the fact that you pretty much can't open new companies (in the old fashion way, at least, almost all of them are distributed in the first round) kind of takes some of the fun away from 18xx.

RATING: 6
Not a great game but a very good one. Purely an operational game. There are definitely some interesting decisions revolving around track laying, choosing "G"oods trains versus regular trains, and managing the train rush for the forming of the national railroads (there are 3 of them and they form at different times). I'd happily play again but probably won't ever be a favorite.

I like how this 18XX starts with all the different kinds of private companies. Really good and recommendable.

I'll play it again, but I wouldn't ask for it over one of the other 18xx titles I like more. 2038 seems less complex in some ways than this title.  Oh and be sure to ask Mike Monical about the time that the two '4' trains stuck together at Gamestorm it's kinda funny.  It made the train rush into something truly terrible.

RATING: 8
Rather well supported by the moderator (easy/accurate moderator support is apparently a design criteria for Helmut Ohley).  The early game is fairly programmatic -- but once the 3 trains pop in the second or third OR the game starts to differentiate heavily.

RATING: 9
Wow, this one really surprised me. I love it!

The initial draft (rather than an auction) speeds the game start. There are perhaps some problems with too powerful starting companies going out in a rote order, but I don't see that yet. 

At this point I feel there is a lot of interesting diversity in how you can choose to develop your minor RRs to set up for the mid-game.  Then there is the genius of the g-trains. They rust on a different schedule and have potential for pretty lucrative routes in the endgame (and a way to inject enough capital into the company to matter). 

But the train rush! There are so many levers in this game, with the trade-ins and that damnable foreign investor. The train rush can be brutal and unforgiving. And then there's no bankruptcy! If you don't play your cards right, you can suffer a fate worse than bankruptcy with those expensive loans.

This is among the top tier 18xx games I've played.

1824 provides a lot of interesting things to think about.  I find the decisions presented by the existence of both normal and g-trains fascinating.  However, some of the people I've played with comment on the slow start to the game as the minor companies build up funds, and on the predictable endgame (which should be played briskly because it's mostly a matter of adding a dollar or two to your income.)  I can see that the game might get a bit repetitive if one were to play dozens of games with the same group, but it's good for a batch of plays for me, anyway.

But the thing is that I have now played 1837, and I enjoy the older, less streamlined version better.  I'm not sure I'll be playing much of 1824; if I have the extra time, I'll play 1837, and if I don't, I'll probably look for a different shorter game.

This is perhaps one of the most varied 18xxs I've played - it's a very unique game - no privates to "strip in", 3 different "big companies" forming from small minors, and miner companies growing up to form major railways.  It also has a tendency to play out very differently depending on how the early game played out - the Sud, in particular can be either a god or a dog - in my first game, I was running the Sud for around $70 a share, while in my 2nd and 3rd games, the Sud was struggling to make $30.  I'm still particualrlly unconvinced by the K & K, which I think is by far the weakest of the "big 3" majors in the game, and only really good for funding other companies.

There's nothing about an 18xx game that provides me any form of enjoyment, and so the prospect of spending another three hours(at minimum) per session at least half a dozen more times just to progress past the conscious incompetence stage is unappealing. The strategies and tactics of this genre will forever remain opaque to me.

A 18xx game about buying private companies with good synergies, and then running companies well while hoping to gain a >60% ownership stake.

Not one of my favorite 18xx design patterns, but does it well.

One play - impressive!  Boy did I get crushed.  While I am sure I did not play especially well, I also feel I missed out due to a decision to go for the independent RR corp, rather than get involved in the pre-state companies.

I am certain I will do better, or at least make different choices next time!

RATING: 7
18xx variation set in Austria-Hungary. The companies and the different ways they are formed offer quite interesting play. Make sure to get in at least one of the three Staatsbahnen and try to combine this with one of the Coal Railways. A mix of normal trains with G-trains is recommended as the G-train will generate much needed extra money for the company. Having two companies in the same region will allow them to work together. An optimal synchronisation of such a "tandem" is one of the crucial elements of this game.

I've read that some 18xx players dislike [b][thing=20646][/thing][/b] because the start is quite slow, but I enjoyed it precisely because the game does develop slowly. And it omits the usual starting auction in favour of a simple round of buying companies at face value. It also has both a forced conversion of minor (pre-state) railways into unified state railways and more open conversions of the coal-to-regional railways. The pre-state railways convert at a specific time and as they're under capitalized before that time, they require careful management. And since multiple players may be running them before they convert, those players that aren't going to get the state director may want to manage their pre-state railroad so that it merges with as little as possible by moving as much of it's assets to another railroad. Meanwhile, the regional railroads can be formed from the coal railroads when the owner chooses (unless forced to late in the game). Deciding when is all part of the puzzle. On top of that, I found the actual map and tile choices rather interesting. Running through Vienna and Budapest were definitely key to high income, but the terrain and track made for some tricky situation.

I didn't like the initial sale, it does not seem quite balanced. Furthermore the easternmost companies really suck, unless they get a lot of help to connect them into the central network.

RATING: 9
I liked. It is not quite full '10' 18xx game like 1856 and 1870 are. I like the different early setup of this game and generally really enjoy the first 1-2 hours as the game flow is dramatically different (well this is oblivously relative) compared to other 18xx games. However there are some issues that prevent full '10' rating: 1) Toned-down stockmarket and lack of excitement during stock rounds 2) End-game drags more than at usual 18xx games 3) no bankrupt...

However there is one additional thing where this 18xx variant shines: It really feels historical railroad game as it is very thematic and its own little well-though nyances succee to create atmospheric experience.

This one seems to be more about track building and less about stock market hustling, but I enjoy it nonetheless. The train rush is quite merciless, and obtaining and blocking routes plays a major role in the game.

Better than its predecessor 1837, but still feels somewhat channeled. Difficult to get much action at the east end of the map. The train discount mechanism is flawed; it encourages a train rush that seems phoney. If all old trains qualified for the trade-in discount then this pressure to upgrade would be eased.

Playtime: ~3-5 hours

Comment: Seemed like one of the easier ones to grasp. I had a hard time fully understanding how the "g" trains worked, but it was a nice addition to the game. The mergers were pretty easy and the auction was nice to just purchase whatever you wanted. A solid game and one that I wouldn't mind playing again.

My only complaint is that the components are a bit shoddy. Nice looking, but the shares are paper thin as well as the trains. Could have been laminated or printed on thicker cardstock.

Optimal Player Count: 4

Plays well with all counts, although 6 might be a bit rough. Typically with 18xx games you'll want 1 player less than max and 1 player more than minimum.

Austria-Hungary, but not 1854. The coal mines are interesting. It takes a while to understand what tiny company can promote to a larger company. Screwing and near Wien very possible.

Keen to get the gamekit of this. Apparently the bits are of low quality but the game itself is fab. Looks similar enough to 1830 to be manageable, but with some nice tweaks.

But, 8.5 hours to play! I could play 1830 *and* Civ in that time.

I've played only two 6-player games. I expect to be better with four/five. There are a lot of companies to start in the beginning and for newbies it is hard to see how this one should be played. First game was a bit boring personally as I played the last ~4h as an investor (became fourth only ~35 margin to a third place). Coal railways and g-trains are nice features. It's not one of the best 18xx but still a good one which I gladly play again.

Excellent 18xx set in Austria-Hungary.  Brutal train rush (at least with 6 players).  I really liked the coal companies and minors and you can form synergies between the two.  Highly recommended.

A solid 18xx variant based on the much longer 1837.  Has a similiar problem to 1837 in that if you're unable to grab part or all of the three nationals you're very unlikely to win the game.  Because of the way the nationals are setup and location there's a huge advantage to the #1 minor for the nationals of which there are only three - so perhaps 3 is the ideal number of players for this variant.  Very solid game, nice chrome it is just the national balance issue tha prevents it from scoring a 9 or 10.

Probably currently my favourite 18XX. It looks difficult on the surface due to the number of different companies but it actually develops quite nicely and is not too difficult once you get the hang of it.

Argh!  Played this at the Chattanooga Rail Gaming Challenge.  As it was explained to me, I didn't think I would like it.  Something about the development of the various companies just seemed to awkward to be enjoyable.  

Now, I can't get the game out of my head.  I keep thinking of different things I want to try.  That, I think, says something positive about the game, but I find I will have too few opportunities to find out.

It's... OK. The early game is too fiddly and scripted, and nothing of major interest seems likely to happen in the late game. The latter problem can be solved by reducing the bank size, but the former can't.

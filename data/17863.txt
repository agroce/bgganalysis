I understand some of the quibbles made about the rulebook.  

Having said that, however, this system is really solid, easy-to-learn-and-retain, and manageable--which is especially important when combining games for a Duration/Grand Campaign version.  

I've found that August/September 1914 play out in historically plausible ways.  "Reinforce the Right" is a key thing for the Germans to do, btw.

This is the best simulation of 1914 I've played. I'm currently having a blast playing this. Moderate complexity, tight rules, great WW1 flavor.

An OK system, IGO-UGO system. Very dependent on supply points and in order to attack, players must expend supply points depending on the size of the forces or be out of supply. The combat system is not odds based but dependent on how many attack points the attacker has and the defenders get the chance to counterattack using the same combat table.

Good points:

1. Easy to handle, even though it is designed to link to other games for a big monster game, its quite well done and more handleable than Europa.

2. Liked the graphics well done map and counters.

3. Liked the supply rules, even though there is some bookeeping, it is quite handlable.

BAD:

1. Rulebook is somewhat confusing and should be better edited.

2. The map while well done can be confusing.

3. The rail movement rules is confusing and can be frustrating.

Getting harder and harder to get these days, so I decided to order them in Germany. 
Billyboy convinced me that this is the best operational game on WW1 there is. Can't wait to play.

Update: Opened the box. Lots and lots of counters for just 1 map (partially with Terrain chart). Looks very good and counter are functional and readable (I like it).

Update 2: Half way through my first game of this wonderfull game.
Although the rules are clear, they are sometime hard to find, but once they sink in, this game plays very very smooth. The CRT in combination with the combat system recreates a very strong image of WW1. You will have enough troops to defend, but if you want progress, you will need to concentrate a lot of troops at a certain point in order to force the breakthrough. Terrain is important (6 different terrains possible per hex), but even more is supply. The supply points are expended by the HQ, where attacking is a lot cheaper then defending, so just sitting in a strategic position will not work in the long run, you will have to get out of the trenches and attack.
In the "von Schlieffen" scenario, the germans have to overcome the Belgians, without any benefits (they don't count in the moral-count), which gives the interresting decision, to either rush through Belgium and leaving the Forts in tact (and most of the Belgian troops), or to destroy the forts and Belgian troops, which will cost you a lot of supply, but opens up the Belgian rail system and will kill the worries for flanking by French/Belgian troops.

The dancing small little guys in the early film of the years ruminates nostalgically me of the light, illusionary and impressionistic visions. Many scenarios for a comprehensive treatment of WW1, at least on the western front.  There are many nice counters, maybe too congested for a single map.  And the hexagon-ized terrains...urh, should call Mark Simonitch or Roger MacGowan come to rescue.

Best operational WW1 system - simple rules but deep, no factor counting, effective and simple supply, evocative and clever map design.  Brilliant concepts.  Best game there is on the 1914 campaigns and the Western Front overall.

This is my first game on the western front in the first world war at operational level. Well, close to the first - have played Operation Michael now that I think of it!

The counters for the Schlieffen Plan are punched, clipped and stored in ziplock.  The remaining four counter sheets are largely unpunched (other than about 40 markers: I needed to punch the DM markers for Britain, France and Germany which were on those sheets).

One of my first gaming experiences was with a friend who owned 1914.  We played so often we actually were concerned that we would run out of the planning sheets.  Over the years I have been looking for a game to recreate that feeling of involvement with WW I.  I think this might be it.

This game and its connected brethren have a simple but deceptively deep feel for the period.  Many of the mechanisms (counterattack, siege artillery, required supply point expenditure, demoralization points) are simple mechanically but very complex in their interactions.

Add to that the fact that it can be played well solo and you have a winner.

RATING: 8
The map and map artwork are integral to the game system. Terrain is based solely upon hexside (apart from city center hexes) -therefore the "knock" on the map graphics are unwarranted.

Map is same area as included in Schlieffen Plan release - but also has some errors corrected (near as I can tell these involve rail-line modifications).

Rating based on the Schlieffen Plan scenario only. I can't imagine playing anything in 1916-17 period would be much fun -static front and lots of forced attacks -non-moving attrition ... not really everyone's thing I would guess.

This is based on three failed solitaire attempts. Why were they failed attempts you may ask, well read on.

The game covers the whole of the western front , at divisional level, between 1914 and 1918. 

It has some very interesting features and some unusual ones as well and as far as I’m concerned a strange rule book, others disagree with that but I’ll provide examples to explain my view.

In reverse order I’ll start with the rule book.

At first I couldn’t understand why I was having problems with this rule book, it wasn’t particularly long or complex but I was constantly going back and forth with the rule book and finding out I had done something wrong or missed a rule. I couldn’t put my finger on why and raised it in Consimworld. This made me think about what exactly my problem was and re-read sections of the rules. Then the light bulb came on, the problem was that the rules were just badly organised.

For examples:

There are rules to cover rail movement restrictions during August. In one section of the rules it states that “No unit may use rail movement during the first five turns of August” But in a different section this is contradicted by  ….Siege Artillery units may use Rail Movement during the 3rd and 4th turns of August. This would have been easier to follow if the exception had been incorporated within the text of the rules it belonged too.  Instead we have one rule saying no units can move, then somewhere else in the rules we have a rule that contradicts it. 

Rule 19-10 Goes on to state '..if an attacking unit is greater then 4 movement points, the strength of the unit is reduced by 1 for every Movement Point over 4 in the length of the supply' However this is then contradicted/changed by Rule 23-4 which states that Artillery units can't attack if the supply line is greater than 4 Movement points. This should have been incorporated within 19-10. 

There are many examples like this and too me it made what is a fairly simple rule book very difficult to follow….others disagree.

Unusual features.

The map…yes it’s unusual. Each hex can have be split into six with a terrain type for each sixth, this is not as bad as it sounds but it does take a little getting used to. How much it adds to the game play I’m not sure but it does add to the cluttered look of the map. The map is very cluttered looking, in part this is because of splitting each hex into six possible terrain types but it is made much much worst by other design decisions.  Clear terrain is a patch work of light brown….why? This just adds clutter and nothing more. 

Also on the map are Maga and Macro hex lines. These are for future games which, as I understand it will not be part of the Great War and may or may not get produced, and again all they add is further clutter.

The Combat Result table - I'm not too sure about critisising this but it ain't smooth. People have praised the system because, it appears, that there is less factor counting when making an attack than in other games. I disagree. Assuming everyone is in supply, you still need odds of a least  3-1 to beat the defender.(the defender fires at triple strength). I found their is more factor counter in this than in other games....and you are often couning 50+ factors!

Other issues that appear broken - Units are halved when attacking across a river, so far so good, but this includes Art as well. Why are Art units affected by a river?. Also trenches cease to exist if their is no enemy unit next to it, but the Hindenburg Line can only be built on existing trenches....which will cease to exist because their is no enemy unit next to them. So in reality you can't build the Hindenburg Line to retraet to...which is what the Germans did. I really don't know why these fairly basic issues were never picked up, and to me, gives the impression of a design thrown together.

Excellent simulation of the Great War on the Western Front. Despite it's number of units, it's not really a monster game (when taken by itself, of course); it can be played as individual, more easily managable scenarios each covering one year of the war. Basically, the game is as big as you want it to be. Really gives you a feel for the unfolding campaigns and operational planning. You must manage your divisions as well as your supplies, feeding ammo into the ongoing battles and trying not to squander it. Careful attention must be paid by the German player in the 1914 scenario to proper fort-smashing techniques, or else, as I learned in my first game as the Germans, Belgium really WILL put the kibosh on the Kaiser. Simply throwing troops at the enemy won't work, leading to massive casualties for little gain. Infantry dominates the game, but artillery is invaluable for its siege ability and its capacity to soften up the enemy at low cost, except in terms of precious ammo, of course. Kudos to the designer for a terrific and fun simulation.

Played a partial game of the Schlieffen Plan.  One rule has a huge impact on the game and that is your opponent gets to counterattack at 3 times his strength points.  Add in forests, rough areas, and the ever present rivers, and the attacker can easily have a -3 to -4 die modifier on his attack while the defender can get a +2 to his counterattack roll.  Thus unless your strength is ~3.5X the strength of the defender, you will likely lose more strength than the defender.  As a result of this, most attacks end up being semi-suicidal, but the Germans have to keep doing these if they are going to advance on Paris.  Furthermore, supply points are so limited that you pretty much have to save them for sieges or critical battles so you end up attacking at 1/2 strength much of the game.  This results in a bloody game with minimal movement where you are very tempted to wait for the other player to make the attack unless you are lucky enough to attack one hex with full stacks on 3 or 4 hex sides.  

The rules were reasonably easy to understand although I would have liked a few pages of really good player aids, because some rules are easy to overlook.  Dividing each hex into 6 triangles seemed to be more trouble than the extra detail was worth.  Having the WW2 railroads on the map was also a distraction and added to the clutter.

My overall feeling was that this is probably a pretty realistic simulation of what the battle was really like.  My problem was that I did not find it that much fun.  This is especially true for the French and British players who spend much of the game simply creating a solid line and reinforcing any weak areas.  Since it is usually smarter for them to wait to be attacked and then load up their supply for a devastating counterattack, they often did not do much on their turns.

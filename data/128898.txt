This is a decent Euro with auction and area control mechanics.  I'm generally not a fan of area control, so my score for this may have been higher without that mechanic.  Even so, I don't feel like there are that many strategies to pursue in this one.  There seem to only be three: area control in the city, trading furs, and clearing land, and the last one seems to be far inferior to the other two.  I wouldn't recommend this as a two-player game since both auctions and area control suffer with only two.

The theme of this one is interesting in its treatment of the Lenape people, the Native American group displaced from the site where New Amsterdam was built.  From a "this is what happened" perspective, it seems not to whitewash history or treat the Lenape disrespectfully.  And displacing the Lenape from their land can actually be a bad thing for the players, which is good.  However, I do feel the game could have done more to emphasize the harm done to the Lenape by the growing colony.

A Euro with a couple of neat mechanics. The components (read: fur) are cool, but had a couple rip during punching. The coolest mechanic is the action phase, but you can get majorly screwed if you can't get the right actions.

I hate auction-games; but the unique auction-mechanic in Nieuw Amsterdam is fantastic (apart from the high risk of AP) ! One of those rare euros that is VERY well-themed! The moving of the Lenape aboriginals up the Hudson accurately reflects their declining fur supplies and the nation's decimation by smallpox.

Schön, dass ich das Spiel jetzt habe. Darauf war ich für diesen Herbst am meisten gespannt, weil es sich thematisch mit genau dem Stoff befasst, der auch Gegenstand des ersten Kapitels des aktuellen Romans von Edward Rutherfurd, Im Rausch der Freiheit (engl.: New York), ist. Ich bin schon sehr erwartungsvoll, wie es sich wohl spielen wird.

Played this 5 handed with myself and two other new players - it was OK but one of the more experienced players was deprived of income in first turns and was hamstrung - I'm not sure I'd want to play this regularly if it's possible to be so sidelined

Well, it's got auctions.  I like auctions and Nieuw Amsterdam's auctions for action types are a fine example of the genre, presenting lots of tough decisions about what a set is worth to you or to your opponents.  That aside, the game is about deciding which one of three point scoring options you will pursue (farms, fur trading or city area control) and doing that single-mindedly.  I found that a bit dull and what's more this game is quite long.

The artwork is quite nice and production quality is good.  A couple of gripes: about the big wooden houses that clutter up city areas, covering up the special action icons; and the player aid unhelpfully printed in one corner of the board.

Very nice medium weight eurogame. The game is about the foundation of Niew Amsterdam (later New York) in the 1600's I found quite thematic how the game represents trading land and furs with native americans. The rules are well written and the game plays in about 90 minutes. It really needs 5 players to shine. The auction mechanism is very interesting as it controls the actions you can take as well as the turn order for the turn. There is enough interaction between the players.

At least the first game was too slow for what it offers. Rating will probably go up if we manage to play this faster.

EDIT: After 2nd game, I decided the game isn't anything special. Lot's of trivial calculation that bogs down the gameplay (maximum bid value = my recources - the recources I need if I win the auction).
Also, town scoring was odd. Would it be better if draws weren't so attractive?

One of the best Euro games out there, from the designer of Alea Iacta Est.  You're a 17th century Dutch settler in New Amsterdam (future Manhattan).  At the heart of the game is a series of auctions, which give you actions enabling you to engage in commerce, grow a corn "engine" to feed your businesses, and engage in fur trading with the nearby Lenape tribesmen so that you can ship fur back overseas.  All of the elements are logical and integrated brilliantly, and you really feel like everything you are doing supports the theme.  Board layout is extremely well organized, and components are of high quality. 

Scales reasonably well for all number of players.
5-player games can run a little long if you are AP prone.  But everyone I know really likes this game.

RATING: 7
decent game where the bidding is very important : important because of the possible actions you can do, but also for the order of playing. I'm not sure yet if the game is well-balanced as one of the three actions seem to be very strong.

RATING: 6.5
The auction is easily the best part of the game, which can be very brutal and unforgiving of mistakes (especially early in the game). I really enjoyed my one play, but I'm not sure how much variability there will be from game to game.

Played my starting houses (or pawns?) in the wrong city districts (it was my first play and did not want to copy the starting move of the two or three players who had gone before me) and after three turns, I was practically out of resources and to fix my engine and get it going would have taken at least half of the game so I knew you would NEVER catch the others who had put their starting houses in the right spots... Luckily, we had to abandon the game after a couple of rounds, otherwise I would have been looking at a pretty dismal time. Just awful.

First Play: Rules seemed clear but I couldn't visualise the way the game would develop. The initial action auction is very clever and forces people to review the benifit of starting position as well as the actions themselves. The special actions need preplanning to avoid delay but experienced players should whip through the phases.

A nice lot to think about and a need to stay on your toes remaining flexible. A very nice game that should improve its rating with more plays.

Second play and yes rating increased to 8.5. There is considerable depth to this game that isn't apparent from the first read through of the rules. The second play opens the door to even more oportunities. Why isn't there a louder buzz about this game?

Just played with 3 and its a much softer experience. 4-5 players is far more cut-throat and brutal. I prefer it with more.

Based on 1 play.

The LAND action was way too strong. The guy who had 2 land actions in round 1 won, and it was evident from the beginning of the game. Will need replay to reassess.

After 2 plays: double trade action is strong as well. So basically double actions are VERY powerful. And having a corn engine is very important.

Drop from 7 to 6: the double land action breaks the game.

A really nice game with many interesting roads to victory. If you can get past the idea of forceabaly displacing the Lenape Indians in order to capitalize on their land, then the game is really a neat design. You have to time your actions very carefully because one mistake can screw you for an entire turn. You also won't be able to do everything you want because the available actions change from turn to turn. Bidding can be very tricky, and you will often find your strategy changing as certain options become closed to you and others open up in their place. I ended up winning without having cleared a single track of land because of city dominance and a few well-timed elections (plus a couple of shrewd fur trades).

I like that everything in the game is equivalent to money for bidding. The auctions are thus kind of interesting, and are definitely the heart of the game. 

For me though, what you do with the lots you win is completely uninteresting. You have two choices of what to do with each tile you win at auction, and for the 2nd and 3rd actions you often can only do one or the other, so a lot of time in this game is spent on executing actions where the decision is forced or trivial. It's basically just procedure after the auctions. The only decision space is in the special actions you are allowed to take each phase, but most of this is just resource conversion - and the planning this requires ensures that the actions part of the game drags. The amount of chrome tacked on to what amounts to a simple auction game is kind of silly. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
Unlikely to be worth playing with anything but 5 players.

Rating is rough.  Seems likely to settle at 6.0.  Currently elevated due to the interestingly predatory nature of the auctions in a five player game.

Update:  Dave Eisen having suggested (correctly as it turns out) that I might like the predatory extortion of the auctions of the 5-player game. With 5 players the game is one of blunt force brinksmanship forced by the once-around auctions. There is a tile set out there that is very good for me and utterly critical for Aliza, I bid N...and Aliza is crippled(?) (maybe?) if she bids N+1, but I'm away singing if I get it for N. How much over value is it worth to Aliza just to keep her position alive, and at what point am I simply wasting money with over-bids -- in an economy where a bid increase of 1 is a Big Deal? How much can desperation be used to force over-payment -- not paying for constructive value, but paying for the permission to not founder, scuttle and die? Now repeat this among various sets of all the 5 players for multi-flavoured dependency relationships in each round, and then do that 6 times. That's the game: one of blunt force trauma via bidding on carefully extortive edges. Good stuff.

With fewer than 5 player the game would be more generous, and would thus lose the charm that made it interesting.

Seems pretty solid after first play. Even if I did get crushed. Ok, so lesson learned: do [b]not[/b] start building city buildings that you don't have the farms to support. 

The action selection/auction system feels pretty different. Lots of tough decisions. Enough variation from randomness to keep it fresh, but randomness doesn't usually target any individual player, so feels balanced. But by the same token, it feels impossible to climb out of an early hole. I don't really have a problem with that per se, just worth noting.

But you gotta give them some credit on the theme. How many games do you have where you're buying furs from Indians in NYC?

Just another mediocre, bare bones, point-salad, turn-resources-into-points kind of euro. It does the same as other bajillion euros do, only slightly worst. It suffers from "soft" player elimination, in that one wrong decision on the first turn may lead a player to be effectively eliminated for the rest of the game.

Take up the task of scoring points by developing New Amsterdam and its surroundings. Build offices in the city, clear new land, farm to feed your population, and trade goods for hides with the Indians (who due to the clearing of the forest have to move further and further away). Make money by selling the hides to European trade ships, and ensure yourself of a flow of goods thanks to these trade relationships.

Pretty good gamer's game here. I like the strategy and long-term planning, but boy can you really screw yourself up if you don't cross all your "t"s and dot your "i"s. I love the bidding phase. So much tension.

I like economic building games. I like [thing=1491][/thing] and its children, [thing=13884][/thing] and [thing=28620][/thing]. I like [thing=9217][/thing]. 

If you don't, stop right here.

[thing=128898][/thing] has 3 interlocking economies and to make progress (and score points) from any of them, you need to acquire an action marker of the appropriate type at auction. The auction each round is very tense and that's where the game is. Decisions about what to put up for auction are interesting as well.

Nothing wildly innovative here. I suppose if you have enough in the economic snowball genre, you can give this one a pass. But I really liked it.

This seems like a good game, but I need to play again to be sure.  In my one play it came down to me destroying my game to stop one player from running away with things (he won anyway), which is not a favorite situation for games to get to for me.  But there was plenty going on, and that could have been an anomoly.

A bit on the long side perhaps (2.5 hours with five players) but a very interesting game. Feels quite thematic as well which is a plus.

I like the bid mechanism where all goods are worth the same, makes more strategies viable and decides how you play the coming turn. As this also decides turn order you can do sneaky stuff here. Nice!

Update: Better with four players, as it's a bit more forgiving.

I don't think this one could go higher than a 7.  It was fun and I like how the auctions are done.  However, I do question how many viable strategies there are.  Depending which strategy is chosen will determine which auctions you need to win.  And especially in a 5 player game, you don't want to be pursuing the same strategy as too many other players.  Otherwise you will have to pay through the nose to win the auctions you need.

RATING: 6
Not a bad game, just not a great one. The auctions can be difficult the first time you play as it is hard to judge how much to pay for the actions that are up for bid. The rest of the game is fairly straightforward action selection.

Read the rulebook. What an interesting game! Nothing new in terms of mechanics but I find they blend altogether really well.

Components are amazing. I love game that combines the use of cards and wooden together, like in Snowdonia.

The auction was a turned off, but people have been commenting it's actually the best part of the game.

The fact that you get to bid only once during the auction (instead of the normal way, where you get to bid and rebid in cycles), is neat. I can imagine that a 5 players game would be quick.

I like the fact that the Indian settlement moves automatically to the right, thus forcing all players to either keep up by shifting their house to the right as well or pay corn to accommodate the work cost to sell/trade to the Indians. 

I want this now!

A játék szép. A tábla jól kigondolt, és minden információ (játékmenet, értékelés, stb) megtalálható rajta ikonokkal, rajzokkal. 
New Amsterdamban vagyunk, a holland telepesek idejében, mielőtt még igaz város , és aztán később New York vált volna belőle. Azaz most kezd épülni, terjeszkedni. Üzleteket építünk a városban, földet tisztítunk meg, hogy termeljünk, indiánokkal kereskedünk -prémért árut adva-, akkor persze folyamatosan szorulnak vissza, ahogy a földeken kiirtják az erdőket.
A játék 6 fordulós. Miden fordulóban van egy előkészítő és a végén egy fenntartási és bevétel fázis. A 2 középső fázis az érdekes: egyrészt van egy licitálási fázis, amikor  bizonyos jogokra licitálunk: azaz h kereskedhessünk, városban építhessünk vagy épp földet szerezzünk. Van játékosszám függő oszlop, minden oszlopban 2 vagy 3 akciókorong, akciókorongok véletlenszerűen kerülnek fel, az előkészületi fázisban. 3 akciókorong fajta: város, föld és kereskedés. LA licit 1 körös, és körsorrendben zajlik, s egyben a körsorrendjelzőre is licitálunk. Mindenki egy akcióoszlopot nyerhet-vihet el, az utolsónak választó értelemszerűen ingyen.
Majd az új körsorrend szerint végrehajtjuk az akciófázisban az akciókat, méghozzá típusonként: előbb a városakciót mindenki, aztán a földet, aztán a kereskedést.
Minden akciótípusban 2 akcióból lehet választani, és egy bónusz akció is van. Az adott akciótípus akciójából az választhat, aki szerzett a licitáláskor az adott típusú akciókorongból. De h senki ne maradjon ki a jóból, minden akciótípusnál lehet egy spec akciót is választani, 6 féle spec akció van, és ez mind három akciónál ugyanazok, ÉS, ebből minden akciótípusnál mindenki választhat egyet, függetlenül attól, h van-e az adott akciókorongból néki.
Ha akár spec akár sima akciót nem választ a játékos, akkor kap helyette 1 pénzt. A spec akciók alapvetően a 3 fő akciótípust segítik, és jó kis kombókra ad lehetőséget, ha megfelelő korongokat szerez az ember, ugyanis az egyes akciók, beleértve a spec akciókat is, bármilyen sorrendben végrehajthatóak. Pl. egy kombó: szereztem 2 földakciókorongot. 1-es földakció: veszek egy földet, utána egy spec akció: beépítem házakkal, majd másik földakcióval a másik félét választom: azaz megtisztítom a területet, ezzel fához jutok, és minden fordulóban gabonát -kukoricát- termel nekem a föld innentől. De ugyanilyet lehet kereskedésre is, vagy akár a városakciókra is tenni.
Jól kiegyensúlyozott, ötletes, jól megcsinált játék, szép is. Persze rossz döntésekkel be lehet szorulni, de utána jó döntésekkel ki lehet vágni magad a szorult helyzetből.
tetszett.
Kár, h tavaly Essenre nem készült el, csak utána vagy 1 hónappal, szerintem jóval nagyobb sikert érhetett volna el.
Elsőre 2 hibával játszottuk,de így is élvezetes volt, az egyik hiba: minden erőforrással lehet licitálni, mi csak a kukorica-fa-pénz hármassal licitáltunk, de lehetne a prémekkel és az árukkal is. Így még kevésbé lehet beszorulni. A másik: a felhasznált -beadott- prémeket nem keverjük vissza a húzópakliba, hanem képpel felfelé egy dobópakliba hagyjuk. Így picivel nehezebb hasonlókhoz jutni.
E 2 dolgot is helyesen játszva valszeg még jobb a játék. Na majd legközelebb kiderül. 
Ja: a játékra 60-120 perc van írva, ez reális lehet, a mi első játékunk -szabálymagyarázat nélkül - kb 3-3,5 óra volt, és mi mindent jóval hosszabbik ideig játszunk, és 5-en voltunk. Szóval valószínű, h 5 emberrel a 2 óra tartható.
Update: 2. parti: több út van a győzelemhez ez már biztos: múltkor a föld projekten kaszáltam, most pedig a városi üzletek értékelésével /persze midn2 esetben azért voltak máshonnan is pontok, de ez volt a fő csapásirány/

I hate this game!!!!!!

I don't believe I've ever said that before.  Dislike, indifference, boredom, sure, but never before blind unmitigated hatred.

My first impulse with this review was to say that the only thing this game is good for is for warming your hands over as you burn it in a trash bin.  

But then I realized that was likely less than charitable and really didn't offer any insight into the reason for my disdain.

I mean it's a decent enough game, kinda.  And it likely could even be enjoyable if you're not the poor sucker that falls behind early.

We were playing with 5 new players and, still taking things in and not fully realizing the implications of a few decisions, I made some key mistakes early and as importantly was the last player to have a turn in round 1 which puts one at a disadvantage from the get go.  I realized less than halfway through that there was no realistic path to victory (and that there really hadn't been since round 2 of 6) and that sucked.  

In a two hour game, realizing that you doomed yourself in the first 15 minutes and that you are then obligated to be attentive to and think through and about moves when the end game is crystal clear is really no fun at all.
  
Choosing one bad option over others that may be marginally better but still bad didn't seem worth the  bother of thinking through.

It wouldn't be nearly as bad if it was shorter.

As it was, the experience became a mind numbing slog that just wouldn't end... It wouldn't.   IT WOULDN'T!!!!

If there is no kind of catch up mechanism at all, at least give a player the chance to begin an insurrection with the natives and join in on burning some of those precious farms and settlements.  Something to at least keep it interesting.

And it would be a nice subversion of the whole "wealthy European settlers turning the screws on the natives" theme.  Turns out a little casual genocide in your theme doesn't make things better.

I was going to give one point for the auction since it seemed cool at first, until it hit me and I realized that that and your starting turn order are exactly the tools that keep you down once far enough behind.

With the auction determining everything. you cannot realistically catch up as the auction becomes too pricey to participate in and you inevitably end up relegated to 4th or 5th spot where all the good turn actions/land/trade prospects are long gone.

Granted, I would be not make the same mistakes a second time, but I was left with such a bad taste in my mouth that I was done with this title for good.  I would also feel horrible about inflicting the experience I had on an unsuspecting newbie.  

I play games to have a good time and socialize not to stare sullenly for hours at a machine that is SLOWLY, inevitably grinding me up to make some funky Dutch sausage for the settlers' feast.  

My take in one line?  I'll play it again when hell freezes over.

Both points in my rating for the fact that it did finally end.

RATING: 5
It's important to separate the play from the game. Unfortunately, my first play sucked. There's no way around that, but I believe that was because this game absolutely demands a one turn restart to get everyone acquainted with proper bid amounts and actions as this is an austere design of unforgiving bid assessments. Whether that's a feature or a flaw should be readily apparently to one's tastes. So much of the game is in which column of actions you purchase and at what price while your decisions about what you do with those actions are usually no brainers and dictated by what you did on the previous turn, e.g., last turn I bought land, this turn I clear the land, etc. 

With the once around bidding mechanism, this puts an incredible amount of pressure on your choice of bids. I mean, choosing your bid amount each turn pretty much IS the game. Furthermore, like Scepter/Outpost, it's a game of compounding advantages/disadvantages. With, oh, an hour or so to go the game was constantly reminding me about the mistakes I'd made while another player was basking in his embarrassment of riches over there. Yes, game, I get it. I'm sorry! Oh my God, I know what I did wrong, game, I'm so friggin sorry! Yes, I see him over there making this look so easy. Oh my God, will you stop punishing me already! All because I went into the game not knowing how to value bids correctly (for the love of God, do a one turn restart).

Now that I know what the hell I'm doing, I'm sure I could have a reasonably enjoyable play of it, but I won't be seeking it out for the simple reason that I don't see how I could possibly groom my group on it without one or more people having a bad session and hating it. It reminded me of Scepter (which I sold) in that regard. Each play resulted in a runaway leader/loser and someone not wanting to play again. I would only acquire this if you have the type of group who likes these types of unforgiving knife fights and is willing to commit to everyone becoming equally skilled at wielding a blade.

RATING: 8
Bought March 2014, based on reputation as a solid economic game.

First play - very interesting. Like some of my favourite Euros, the dynamics created by interlocking resource markets is thought provoking. Superb thematic integration. Also, the game succesfully delivers a sense of building an enterprise.

Second play - again, two player. I think this will shine with three or four, due to congestion around the auction bidding. What became apparent during this game is that there are three different basic strategies - fur shipping, land clearing or town elections. With 4+ players, there will be some intense competition.

Third play - with four players New Amsterdam worked very, very well. The auction mechanic is superb, especially the ability to use any resource as payment. Based on this play, I think land and trade should be early priorities, with careful attention paid to the special action which permits blind fur trading. Previous rating of 7 bumped up to 8.

RATING: 4
Rating based on one play. I really wanted to like this game. The theme is cool, and the auctioning of actions is an interesting mechanic. Unfortunately, the game suffers from serious design issues. The orange action is overpowered: spend wood to build houses that are going to get you points AND money per turn, which can be used to purchase more wood to build more houses? Or, alternatively, score points based on how many houses you have on the map? This creates a huge problem of the rich getting richer while the poor struggle to make ends meed, also thanks to game mechanics that punish early mistakes way too much (I spent most of the game without wood to build houses in order to clear land, and without any money or actions to buy it, because I threw away my wood early and needed the money and the actions to purchase food).

By contrast, the white action seems quite underpowered as a point-building machine. Its main use is to build an engine to power the orange action, and to screw up however seems to be trying to capitalize on the blue action - since yellow happens before blue and it can make the purchase of furs harder. Blue is okay, although a little luck-based (you may be able to sell huge sets of furs, or end up with many spares who aren't worth nearly as much as the sets). However, the fact that yellow and blue can be hindered (if someone takes all the good terrain or the furs you need before your turn, for example), while orange cannot, just makes the advante of orange so much bigger.

Another big issue of this game are the downtimes: they are painful with 4 players (I can't imagine how tedious it has to be with 5) and given the shortage of "special" actions and resources, analisis paralisis is always around the corner. Which leads, of course, to MORE downtime. 

I may give this game another chance, but I'm confident my rating isn't going to increase much.

This is fairly challenging; however, the challenge comes from figuring out what the system is doing rather than what the other players are doing.

The worrying thing about games like this is the looseness of the system, making it very difficult to gauge the value of the myriad resources available. I need to give this another go, but this kind of easy-but-different points approach just isn't cutting it with me any more.

Essen 2012 (one game experience): good first impression, rating might go up to 8 after repeated plays.

Feb. 2013: 2. games majority strategy in city seems to be overwhelming. If a fellow player starts to go for it, you are forced to participate as it seems to give much more VPs than with shipping furs. (which realistically doesn't seem possible to do 3-4times max. during the course of the game.). Downgraded from an initial 7.5.

Jó kis agyalós, minden-mindennel összefüggős játék. Különösen tetszik benne az egykörös licit, az akcióválasztás a random lerakott lapkákból, nomeg az is hogy a nyersanyagok szinte mindenhol helyettesíthetőek, de mindnek van egy-egy olyan létfontosságú akciója, ahol csak ő jó.
Eurogémer játékhoz képest elég tematikus is, főleg szegény indiánok költözése tetszik ezzel kapcsolatban.

New Amsterdam revolves around the auction at the beginning of each turn. How much are you willing (and able) to pay to get the actions you really want? And do you actually still want them if that makes you go late in turn order?

There is nothing particularly new in this game but it does all fit together nicely and the minimalist actions just zip past. The game absolutely requires the competition and tension in the auctions, however, so is likely not worth playing with only 3 players.

initial rating of a 7 after a game played with three.  I believe this will shoot up with five playing, as the tension in the auction and competition for resources should ratchet up.  I would say this is a nine with 5, so splitting the difference at the moment.

It suffers a little from the same curse as the Princes of Florence in that it really needs five to make the auction shine.  Otherwise an outstanding game.

the best thing about Nieuw Amaterdam is the once around auction. this means thaT you'll have to live on the edge all the time.
I didn't think it was terrible with 5 (our group is usually mostly 5players so we look for games that support 5 specifically) but it can be very brutal and also, alas, a bit AP prone because of the auction. 

the rest of the game is quite straight forward, with your actions mostly guided by what is available in the ship, land and fur market.

It is also nice and quick with two, and the auction mechanism is nice then as well because the 2nd player gets what he wants for free, meaning that he has way more resources than player 1 nicely compensating for the lack of a third action.

RATING: 6.5
Good game, multiple paths to victory. I think if you are to invest in buildings then you need fields... but both of these can generate points.

The alternative is to invest in furs. Furs generate more goods through shipping, which are traded for furs - and also generate points.

Both are viable ways to win and you will end up competing with others that go down the same path. If 2 alpha players go for one strategy and only 1 goes for another then the 1 guy on his own should win. Unfortunately diversification rewards nobody, hence why I felt it was possibly only a 6.5

Not bad at all, although it could be a little competitive. The auction mechanism works fine and is the best part of the game, but if you win the first auction, resolving the actions afterwards offers little excitement as you can calculate your points after the auction, without the other players being able to interfere. Still, I had good fun playing this.

I really enjoy this game, it presents you with many options to get points but demands that you make efficient use of your actions. 

[b]Auction:[/b]
The actions in the game are auctioned. There are three types of action and each is represented 4 times on tokens. These tokens are shuffled and arranged in 2 groups of 3 and 3 groups of 2. The first player chooses one to put up for auction along with the first player token (if someone else wins the auction then the first player takes that player's turn order marker).

This is one of the most interesting auctions I've encountered. You are bidding on the actions you will do that round as well as the turn order for doing them. You must be very careful with how much you bid, you need to carefully consider how the round will play out and what you'll need if you win. Then you have to weigh the rewards against bidding on another group of actions.

[b]Planning:[/b]
There is a fair amount of future planning that is possible in this game, but you also have to remain open to other options the auction may throw at you. I like the thought process of planning out a round once you have your action tokens, but it can be quite difficult to do this perfectly. There are a lot of little costs that crop up and it's easy to miscalculate by 1 and end up missing out. Usually you could have avoided this if you had seen it coming and usually it's too late to redo those earlier actions.

It's a double edged sword because I love this about the game. You are trying to run things at the absolute limit. You want to bid everything you can to get those awesome actions, but if you accidentally pay 1 too many your plans will collapse.

RATING: 8
What has happened to auctioning as a game mechanism? New Amsterdam proves the greatness of this mechanism when done right. The auction for the action tiles drives game. You need a plan and an understanding of the worth of each lot for the opponents. With less than four players the game will fall short of its potential, with experienced players it will fully fulfill its promise when bids are high and resources get scarcer.

Another nice element are the secondary actions, one of which can be done each action phase additionally or skipped to earn a coin. They lengthen the game but increase the decision room notably.

One of the best first plays I had in 2015.

This game encourages a runaway leader problem. The city hands out both points and money, which can be used to outbid everyone for the best set, which means you get to go first again if you started, and then you repeat that. Your strength in the city is seriously constrained by the strength of your economic snowball, so while the rich are getting richer, the poor are getting poorer as well. This game doesn't even try to constrain the snowball, it does its best to encourage it. Poor design.

RATING: 7.5
Very good complex Eurogame that is built on the theme but has intertwining mechanisms, everything is important for a few reasons etc. It is a multiple ways to win game where you could focus on one of the ways but there is the tension coming from the fact that the actions for the given way might or might not be available. I really liked it!

There might be one small problem though: even though there is some story arc here, it's not very strong - yes, you fight for majorities, yes, the Indians are moving, yes, there are two slightly different sets of cards for the first three and the second three turns, and even the triangular scoring builds up something, but still, you're basically doing the same in the subsequent turns with randomized card/tile distribution but nothing to make subsequent games very different. So it might have slight replayability problems (maybe only after 10 plays) but not to an extent that it would disturb me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
After one play I am very intrigued in this game.  The novel aspect of being able to use anything in the auction as a value of 1 really opens up the options to go different directions for pursuing points.  The game is relatively simple to play but is quite challenging to do well in formulating your action plan as the action disks that allow you to use 2-3 actions are what is up for bid and the distribution is random (four of each action disk are mixed together).

"The game mechanics are very intertwined -- Business in the City require food, but provide money. ... With only 6 rounds of play, and each round consisting of between 3-6 actions, there is very little time to do everything you want to do,  ... I'm very impressed by how elegant the game plays"

The auctions are the heart of this game; how far are you willing to go to get what you really want? My last game featured insane bids as high as 14, including two players who spent piles of valuable furs as auction fees (in different rounds.)

In my first game of this, with 4 new players, we got a few rules wrong, notably the special actions (you get exactly one whether you have zero, one, or more action disks of that phase's color); it didn't seem very interesting. (We did figure out at the end that we'd played wrong, that's why I was willing to give the game another chance, and I'm glad I did.)

The houses that players use to build in the city districts and on their farms and warehouses are big chunky wood bits; very nice, but when you put more than a few in a city district they cover up the icons for the actions. (People who are bothered by this may want to replace them with smaller houses from Power Grid, Settlers, or another game that uses more standard game bits.) 

This is a simple game but it requires a fair bit of planning ahead and figuring out how to stretch your resources to cover everything you want to do, or at least everything you think you can stretch far enough to do.

The theme suckered me in (that's a common [i]theme[/i] among my "Previously Owned" titles) but once it hit the table...geesh!  What a mish-mash of mechanisms, none of them working in concert and all of them struggling for preeminence in the design.  Plus, you could just end up with useless actions at the end of the auction.  Fun!

Not a bad game, though not as thematic as it might seem. However, there is a lot of downtime and especially at the beginning there are a lot of murky rules issues that make it hard for newbies to play well. Especially the having to pay corn for your houses is a rule that can mess someone up big time.

Dull.  And the randomized auctions mean that often one player wants an auction more than others, and can get it for cheap.  If it's worth $15 to him (a high amount), it's hardly worth $16 for me just to stop him.  

Plus the three main actions are nearly identical, with only illusory and superficial differences.

In 1620 Amsterdam, players bid on sets of action tiles which could be 2 or 3 tiles. The possible action tiles are 1) city, which allow a player to put buildings down for area control purposes, or a player can score his city, 2) land, which allow a player to get land or a player can clear land to earn corn and wood, 3) trade which allows a player to earn pelts from the natives or ship them for VPs. During actions, players also get special actions.

The key to this game is bidding correctly for your set of action tiles. If you bid too much, you will get first choice of tiles, but perhaps have not enough resources left over. But if you bid too low, you might be left with undesirable tiles.  There are different strategies to pursue, to try the land approach, try to dominate in the city, trade frequently or a combination of all three. The obly drawback in this game is that a mistake early (such as bidding too much) can put you out of the game, and it does take 3 hrs to play with 5 players. It's a fun game to play if you don't mind auction games, and the game length.

Just another euro with nothing really special standing out...

okay, I had a bad game.  The game is played out in 6 rounds, and by the 3rd, my early lead in points was suddenly halted and there was absolutely no way to get out of the hole I was in.  Worse than being stuck with non-mergeable hotel chains in Acquire, I could do nothing but pass my turns over the last two rounds. The game has an interesting theme, with the idea that the natives you trade with are pushed farther away as the city grows, but the bidding mechanic is dumb.

This ended up on the shelf unplayed when I received it from the Kickstarter campaign, and sat there for a few yerars. What can I say, Buying games goes faster than playing them. 

But recently we opened the box and started playing, and it became the game of the month in our group in february. Now we've moved on, but it's a really great game and I'm sure I'll return to it in the future. 

I really like the action-auctioning mechanisms. The game also have a very well thought through playing board with all rules explained with symbols on the board.

I usually like this type of games but New Amsterdam did not click with me the first play. I think the game will get better with more plays when everyone knows the value of the different actions so that the auctions get moore interesting.

RATING: 7
New Amsterdam is an auction game where you're bidding on how many and what kind of actions you'll be performing on your turn.  There are definitely different things to focus on, from building up the city itself, to planting fields, to shipping goods, each of which will give you its own unique (though usually monetary) advantages.  Despite there being very different paths, the auctions are still interesting, as the actions are pretty broad.

A really tight economic resource-management engine building game. The auctions are really interesting. They are once-around affairs that determine not only the actions a player can take, but also turn order. Furthermore, players can use any or all types of goods to pay for their bids. It's fascinating, even if it sometimes is slow. My games have clocked in just over the 2-hour point.

RATING: 6.8
Nehéz ügy, mert alapvetően tetszik játék, szép a kidolgozás és sok mindenre kell itt is figyelni, mint egy város felvirágoztatásánál, így pl. a kereskedelemre, a házak építésére, hajók vásárlására stb. 
Viszont tanulság az, hogy az elején kell olyan beruházást csinálni, amivel termelődik sok fa és kukorica, így a későbbiekben ezzel nem kell (annyira) foglalkozni. Mert ahogy lenni szokott, a pénzből/terményből mindig kevés van, így nem lehet licitálni a jó dolgokra, ergo mindig a túlélésért fogunk küzdeni.
Mondjuk mint később kiderült nem jól játszottuk a játékot, a felhasznált -beadott- prémeket nem keverjük vissza a húzópakliba, hanem képpel felfelé egy dobópakliba hagyjuk. Így picivel nehezebb hasonlókhoz jutni.
Illetve ami fontosabb, mi csak a kukorica-fa-pénz hármassal licitáltunk, de lehetne a prémekkel és az árukkal is. Így még kevésbé lehet beszorulni.
Ezek segítettek volna, de mivel mi így játszottuk, ezért ennyi pontot kap.

I was really surprised by this game.  I love the auction mechanic (but I have a soft spot for auctions).  Clearly at its best with five players, which is really the only limiting factor in getting it to the table.  So many agonizing decisions as you are constantly pulled by one arm, then the other.  It really is a vicious Euro scramble!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a very tough game. Players bid at the start of each round for not only turn order, but the actions they are allowed to resolve. The bid is really interesting in that you can spend even resources on the bid, which means you could easily get the actions you need but find you've overspent and then you might not be able to resolve those actions properly. I'm not sure how getting a big early corn production isn't the best move all the time, as it not only fuels your other goals, but since you can bid with it, you can win whichever auctions you want. Of course if several players realize that, then they'll bid more aggressively for it and turn order so maybe that self balances? 

The game is unique in that I can't easily describe it to someone using the generic terms we have for mechanisms. This to me is a really good thing. The problem with the game is that it feels very feast or famine. Either you have more than you can use of something, or you don't have any. It's extremely punishing for players who make mistakes, and at the end, win or lose, you don't really get the satisfying feeling of having built or accomplished something. It feels close to greatness, but it's just lacking some crucial magic.

Lots of theme in this Euro, components are nice although the cards aren't the greatest (slippery finish and warped somewhat.) Beautiful board and nice artwork.

We enjoyed the game somewhat but there is not very much player interaction (except for the auctions which isn't a favorite mechanic of ours.) Can be brain burning at times. I supposed an AP player could be a problem. Over all a pretty good game but my gaming partner decided the game didn't have the kind of action he likes so the game won't stay in our collection. (We generally do not like Euros where you are basically converting resources to points.) 

Rating is based on two plays with 2 players.

--Jan2013-- Unforgiving economic snowball game, with some lovely (if slightly inconsistent) production values.  Dithered a bit whether to assign it immediately to the [bgcolor=#66ff99][color=#66ff99]_[/color][b]8[/b][color=#66ff99]_[/color][/bgcolor] pool, or leave it down at [bgcolor=#99ffff][color=#99ffff]_[/color][b]7.7[/b][color=#99ffff]_[/color][/bgcolor] for an initial rating.  I really enjoyed it.  Found it a bit perplexingly difficult; but definitely enjoyable.  My difficulty, I think, is that the number of local folk with whom I can play it is pretty limited.  The next play will solidify the rating in one of the two buckets; if I were to guess, it'll be the higher one!

My recommendation for a first play of this game is to play a turn and then set it up again and restart. It's a bevy of interlocking resources and costs that you won't quite get until you realise you're one wood, or one good, or one corn short for what you need. (Which is more of an early game problem rather that recedes once you've got a bit of an engine going.) Indeed you really feel like you're playing against the resources in the game rather than against the other players - even in the auctions it's a matter of how many resources you can afford to bid more than how much a particular combination of action tiles is worth.

It's a competitive blend of auction for actions, area majority, resource engine, VP generating hullabaloo/salad. Yet it's all packaged in what's actually quite a simple to understand rules package. The biggest rules confusion was understanding why the long huts and river did so little in the game. Some of the pieces of the puzzle seem a little unnecessary (perhaps a result of trying to integrate theme into the package), such as the trading post movement, Native American settlements and corn payment for long distance trading. For such an investment in game pieces, additional rules and board real estate it turns out being rather a non event in resource or special action commitments.

Worthy of further play to explore all the moving bits, and it looks likely that it'll be fun to explore, but overall it feels like perhaps the game could have profited from some more play testing and development - particularly with regard to the Native American settlements. The pay with anything auction system is forgiving - perhaps too forgiving, but it doesn't change the fact that at times you have to pay with exact goods, wood or corn. So, the special action was born to allow up to three resources swaps/exchanges per turn - nice and forgiving - as if it was recognised that players needed to dig themselves out of a hole from time to time, or just needed one more fur to fill one of those new ships. Sure, but it's amazing how many times it's not tight enough that the free action just results in picking up a coin because a player just has nothing else worthwhile to do.

In the late game the dependence upon certain tiles in the auction becomes annoying for at least one player - guaranteed - especially in a five player game and becoming less so with fewer players. Players who've built a goods engine are desperately in search of trade tiles (sometimes finding they're spending nine goods on a special action to receive only three random furs before their wharfs fill with goods again), and desperate to get a trade tile to ship those furs. Random distribution of the action tiles can result in some weird bidding (partially due to turn order), to deny a player or desperately get an action tile you need. It can get ugly. Is the designer trying to push players towards a balance of buildings, land and ships?

Personally I don't really mind this school of hard knocks mechanism in my games, but there's usually other gamers at the table and inevitably one of them at the table is not having a good time, which means I'm not.

I remain a bit confused as to why the buildings are so damn big? They're just huge!

Elegant bidding and resource management game. All parts work like a well-oiled machine and contribute to theme and strategy.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
In an abstract Euro way, it conveys the economics of a colonial colony in 17th century America (in this case, the Dutch colony of New Amsterdam during the 1620s and 1630s); the mutual dependency (furs for finished goods) between Indians and Europeans; and the consequences, over time, of these actions (depletion of available fur animals; conversion of Indian lands into farmlands; and the eradication of Indian villages). Religious motives and military necessities are not represented.

Once you play a couple of turns, the game plays quite fast. There is a unique bidding system which determines player-order and the type of actions (City, Land, or Trade) you may perform. Within each action type, there are choices such as: City Step (build businesses or hold elections), Land Step (acquire new land or clear land previously acquired), Trade Step (trade goods for furs or ship furs). There are also special bonus actions that allow you to do everything from exchange corn & wood for money (or vice-versa) to acquire farm houses needed to clear land, warehouses needed to store goods, or furs.

A Classic euro with everything very well tied together in a 90 minutes bidding game.

Players bid for their actions in the future to be New York City. Nieuw Amsterdam tells us about the Dutch colony built on the Hudson River and the fur trading with the natives. Some may think of it in offensive or unrespectable terms. Nonsense, in my opinion. The history is there somehow and this game treats it right, in a dense web of medium/major decisions based on a bidding for the actions core mechanism.

But the game is more than just bidding. Players must realise where to dispose their houses, trade for furs or clear the fields around them. Everything paced up river with the better actions getting more and more expensive because of player's interests.

A very intuitive and clever design, in my opinion. Apart from the 'pay your bid with anything you want' (all your stuff is allowed), which I understand in terms of design but don't find very elegant, I like almost everything about Nieuw Amsterdam. It is playable in less than 90 minutes, easilly.

Although I've played it once only, I can see more than one winning strategies. Or maybe it's one of those 'keep everything going on' kind of game, in which players should get balanced strategies among all the available options. Not sure yet. A plus in my colection, for the moment.

This game does not take kindly to fools, certainly not gaming fools who can't value the auctions or plot a course of actions before the action auction. This game is touch on the first outing, entirely possible to put yourself out of the running on the first auction and even possible to cripple multiple turns with a real howler. As such its intriguing and makes me want to try again. Wonderful graphic design and accomplished and brave first big game J Allers. 


2nd play. Wow do I not like this with 3 players. It feels so much looser, as if all the seems have popped. Money is more p,entiful, te city more powerful and the auction pressure much less interesting. Rated 7 as 4 or 5 player, a 4 on my 3 player experience.

Once around auctions are almost always a bad idea.  In this case it's even worse than usual.  Certain actions are far more valuable than others, and going first is vital.  Would not play this game again.

Usually when I'm told that a game has different scoring according to your strategy, it means point salad for everything you do. Not in this game where you are rewarded according to your long term strategy, but will need to play on other player's turf (especially with 5 players).

The once around auction where you can pay with whatever resources is at the heart of the game and it's quite ingenious. So is using woods and furs. For once you're not doing point conversion for the sake of it. 

The only thing that feels tacked on is the area control. It's the main money and VP engine but it's loosely tied to the game.

I love the components and theme, but I'm torn by the execution. The bidding mechanic at the beginning of each round is interesting but pretty brutal. It can be quite difficult to actually come away with the actions you need and the resources to actually perform them. This is particularly painful because each kind of action is intimately related to the others. In order to perform optimally, you really need to be able to cycle through different action types.

Ultimately, I don't feel like I'm in control of my strategy in this game. I can't say, hey I'd like to spend my game shipping furs, because I may never be able to reliably win trading/shipping actions from the auction. The game is clearly about doing the best you can with what you're able to eke out, but in a game this long and prone to analysis paralysis, I want a little more control over what's going on.

I'd play this again, but I think it's probably best as a 3 player game. Enough players to make the auction interesting, but not so many that the game slows to a crawl.

Euro auction game about the growth of New York (then New Amsterdam). Players bid for the right to take three types of actions: building the city (and scoring points for dominating it); trading with the Lenape for furs (and scoring points by sending them abroad); and clearing the land for wood and corn, displacing said Lenape in the process (and scoring points for becoming a large landholder).

What makes this interesting is the auction. Bids are once-around for a combination of turn order, coins, and 2-3 action discs, distributed randomly before each auction. There might be a column with two land actions, one with a land action and two city action etc. Depending on a player's strategy, they might [i]need[/i] one of those actions. They might even need it at a particular point in the turn order. How much can you afford... and how much can you make them pay?

While the bids are the easily most interesting decisions in the game, the auction is also easily the slowest, to the point that it will give downtime-conscious players pause. It also doesn't scale at all; there are no changes to that part of the setup with lower player counts, so the auction is much less interesting (and resources correspondingly less tight) with fewer than five players.

Good game. Interesting bidding for action. You don`t what combinations will be avaible in next rounds. In the current round some combinations would be more important for you or maybe only one combination will be good for you. But when you choose something for bid, you must bid first, so its easy to overbid you (every player can bid only once). So you cant specialize, because then you are to limited.

In my 3 player game everything was ok. The rules are clear and easy, but you have some choises. But there was no big pressure. 

Must see how the game will working with 4 or 5 players.

Edit: After the second game - Good game, but nothing special. All the small things are interesting, but not affect yhe game much

Eh. I had some specific problems with the game, including that, unless you already know the game very well and bid appropriately, this game has a rich-get-richer tendency that's apparent from the very first turn. But more generally, despite the fact that I typically love auction games, New Amsterdam just felt very uninspired and kinda ho-hum. There was not enough fun or challenge to any of it that made me want to play again to master the tricky puzzles presented by the bidding for actions.

First Impression:

A surprise, this euro is a pretty fresh approach to the Eurogame genre.

A well balanced game, with solid mechanics, tough decisions and a well done auction system at its heart. It has a little bit of area control, a little of set collection, a lot of timing and all this blend together really well.

On the downside, the theme hurts the game for me, as I'm completely uninterested in kicking indians out of their homeland as a wealthy dutch colonist (ok, you're not doing just that in the game but anyway..you're not even doing it with style). The theme is however well intergrated for a euro, so if anyone is interested in the foundation of Neuw Amsterdam, this is going to be a blast.

Overall this is an unispiring game for me, that however tickles all the right spots once I'm convinced to play it.

Allers has designed several good games and the hard-to-find Heartland is one of our favorites.  Heartland is the essence of elegance: Low rule maintenance, pacing of the game is rapid and turns are quick, lots of short-term tactics sprinkled with some general unpredictability, etc. It will remain on our collection for a long time to come. New Amsterdam tries but fails to achieve the same "elegance" that is the core of Heartland. Allers tries to weave different currencies and variables into the game by linking up production of one resource acting as currency for another. In general that works, but the game has a lot of moving parts and not everything is intuitive. In general, the game's scoring mechanism comes from three sections: shipping fur, building businesses and clearing land. It is not clear if diversifying scoring or specializing in one area is the key to victory. My hunch is that this will depend on the actions being auctioned. Understanding when to go for double actions to push a specific track is important. Two things of note, the actual currency in this game is not really money. In essence, everything as a resource can be used as currency in auction. So then, money is undervalued and really not that crucial save for paying for special actions. Wood, corn and goods are clearly the major commodities in the game as they also act as money.
     New Amsterdam does have two unique mechanism. The abovementioned auction where all resources can be used as currency is one. I don't recall any other game where auction can be conducted with all resources. Another being the displacement of the Lanape Indians. The author used the displacement as a track for land clearing and it works. The heartbreaking dintegration of the native communities are well depicted as the number of long houses in each subsequent inland segment is reduced.

Just a great game. Gorgeous components too. Each round you randomly set out groups of possible actions, then players bid on them. Each action can be used in one of two ways, or redeemed for cash if you don't need that kind of action. Actions are things like building houses on the board, scoring points based on majorities of said houses, buying new land, trading for furs, shipping furs for points, and so on. The actions correspond directly to what tokens you win, so if you want to buy new land you need to bid on an action group that contains 1 white token, and so on.

What I liked about the auctions was that you could pay anything you have on hand to satisfy your bid. So, you bid 6, then later when you pay, you can pay 2 food, 1 fur, 2 wood and a gold, for example. Or 6 goods, or 5 gold and 1 good, etc.

The thematic integration is excellent, there was a great moment in our first game where it dawned on us why each time we bought new land, the natives moved further down river... And their numbers dwindle.

I'm sure the usual suspects will say there's nothing innovative here, but I think it's great fun regardless.

Great gamer's game from Essen 12.  Lots of strategies and options.  The theme fits in excellent with the mechanics.  The need to take land to clear for farming or trade for pelts in order to ship goods works in well with the city merchant actions and the need to control those areas.  Three primary ways to get points (city election, land clearing, fur shipping) but how to get each are to the where you maximize your points is a challenge.  I also like the auction mechanism where you bid with resources that are all equal in value (everything is worth 1; coin, pelt, resource, wood, corn) which forces you to consider your bid across all your resources rather than just worrying about how much money it's going to cost you to win an auction.  There is no luck in this game.  Everything you have or can do is known at the start of your turn.  You'll live or die based on your choice of actions.  There is one action you could take that involves luck (blindly drawing furs from a Black Market action) but that's an action of choice and not a requirement.  I prefer just a bit of uncertainty or luck factor in a game but this might be right the right game for you if you don't like chance.

Wow...a real euro game where the theme is well suited to each mechanism in the game. It all makes sense. 

I was surprised in a very pleasent way with New Amsterdam. There is much here to engage a player and because of that, time goes by swiftly. The game does not overstay its welcome in gaming time. I have only played with 2 players, but it did play well and elegantly, and kept me thinking through the whole game. 

This is not a simple game, nor is it complicated. But there is quite a bit to consider so may not be suitable for new gamers. Like many medium-heavy euros, AP prone need not apply.

So I was at Essen with a wad of cash and I had the opportunity to purchase New Amsterdam.  But right next to the vending booth was a salesman with a foot in a jar.

The dilemma: Even though the salesman's right leg was sawed off at the ankle, I wasn't convinced that the foot in the jar was really his.  It looked too big, and kinda warped. He insisted that the glass container bent the light, and it was common knowledge that the laws of physics explain jars, light, and jar-light bending. 

No way, I said. I know a huckster when I see one. So I left with a shiny copy of New Amsterdam, awfully pleased with myself.

What was I thinking? I could have had a FOOT in a JAR.  Sometimes I am such an idiot.

Typical Euro without anything that I'd call revolutionary mechanics-wise, but definitely a solid experience.  It's possible that some overly sensitive souls could find elements of the game offensive. (During the game, your European traders clear cut Indian land and force them upriver, reducing their numbers....and you're playing a fur trader which not everyone thinks is cool.)  Components are very good and are solid wood, although this does result in some manufacturing irregularities which perfectionists may find troubling.  I personally thought they were top notch.

It's possible that this rating may improve with repeated plays.  In both games, we focused on the two "obvious" paths to victory, but in our post-mortem we considered that there may be a third focus using land control that could prove valuable given the right circumstances.  Overall, a good effort and worth investigating as long as you aren't concerned with the theme (which is mostly pasted-on, as in the case of most Euros.)

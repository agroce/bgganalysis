Interesting, and perhaps with kids the outcome of the game become a little bit more exciting, don't get me wrong, the game is far from being bad or evenboring,it's just not as exciting as I thought it would be. In a different environment it may soar. It will remain in my collection as I foresee it being used. Component quality is off the charts, from the weight of the marbles to the elevated player mat, everything screams quality. If you got young kids it's a given.

It was interesting trying to solve the abstract puzzle a few times, but the game looks like it might get repetitive after a few tries and speed games are not my thing. Solid components.

This will probably work as a filler, but with so many good ones out there vying for that position and my dislike for timed games, I doubt it will get to the table or in my collection.

RATING: 6
Good, simple, spatial fun. The game looks very nice on the table and it provides a simple structure to play within. It's interesting to me how very minor tweaks to how you stack your spheres will affect your score. I expected everyone to do the same thing each turn, but that doesn't happen. The timing element is critical or else players would all just min-max for a while until it all works.

Excellent speed puzzle type game that will have your brain hurting by the end.  The spread of cards is nice and the possibility of getting impossible to complete ones or easy to complete ones is great.  Just have to be careful you don't lose the balls, but other than that a great game with great components.

RATING: 7
I've always enjoyed puzzle games like this.  While there's little interaction, seeing if you can solve the puzzles better than the other players is still fun.

In this one, 6 cards are flipped, showing the requirements for your pyramid of balls for this turn.  For example, you might need to use exactly 2 orange balls, white and black balls cannot touch, no white balls can be on top of other balls, orange and black balls must always be touching each other, etc.

Players then have a minute to organize their balls in a way that matches as many of the cards as possible, while using as many balls as possible.  Points are scored for using balls, and lost for any goal not met.  A bonus is scored for using balls of every color in addition to meeting all 6 goals.

Overall, just a fun, quick puzzle game that works well as a filler.

This is a three-dimensional logic puzzle that involves stacking colored balls according to rules established by cards drawn each round. Examples might be that blue balls and black balls cannot touch each other, or that green balls cannot be on top of any other balls. I tend to love logic puzzles of this sort, and I thought that the 3-D nature of the game would add a new layer of difficulty (beautiful components by KOSMOS, by the way), but on this night the cards were far too easy to complete in their entirety. Over six or seven rounds, there were only two in which we didn't both get perfect scores with plenty of time to spare. I'm not sure if this is representative of the game, or if it was just our session, but I couldn't help comparing it to Uluru in my mind, a sublime example of this type of game that has always proven much more challenging to me. If given the choice, I would play the latter every time, but I would not be opposed to running through Dimension again. Innocuous.

Dimension is an abstract puzzle game that was pleasantly surprised by.  The game is short - about 30 minutes or so - with a fun element of timing.  I'm usually not a fan of "rushed" games with a timer, but I liked this one: this is enough time for everybody, but not enough where you can overthink things.

I hope this makes it across the pond so I can pick up my own copy in English!

A fine idea executed poorly.  My chief complaint is that the constraint cards are difficult to differentiate under anything less than ideal lighting; telling blue from black is impossible.  We spent more time trying to decide correct colors on the cards than actually assembling the puzzles.

Picked this one up randomly via Amazon Prime Day this year.  I am normally not a spacial/puzzle game guy, but I liked how this one made me think.  It's one of those games where I can throw into the mix, but can only play one game in a sitting.  Mind bending, but fun.

Variable spatial puzzles - right up my alley!

The scale is small enough that it's mostly tactical, though, and not quite difficult enough for my tastes - my first 3 rounds I scored 10, 11, and 11. I'd much prefer a version with a larger pyramid, and more/different sorts of constraints, where more planning / mental gymnastics were required.

RATING: 4
A neat and hugely accessible puzzle game. The game boils down to three factors; quickly parsing the objective cards, identifying the potential contradictions, and maximizing the total number of spheres used. The addition of the sand timer helps keep the game moving and creates a mildly chaotic air, but I and others have found the sand timer too long. Several situations have occurred where multiple players have optimally placed each sphere and are left waiting for the sand to expire. And even if the formation isn't mathematically optimal, players will very often end up with incredibly similar scoring results. If playing with intelligent adults, the puzzle simply isn't difficult enough. I can imagine this could strike gold in the right family, but it was a miss for my group.

Good game, with nearly the same mechanics as Uluru. The tasks are more straight forward then with Ulru (nothing like I want the same or the opposite of X). You can always achieve every task by just placing a lesser number of balls, but thereby loose points for placing those. Really good game and differently enough from Uluru to have both.

The evil spawn of Pylos and La Boca. And that's not a bad thing. Enjoyed playing this with friends recently. Adds a bit more complexity versus La Boca as there are always six cards laid out with rules (pictograms) for how you can play the different coloured balls. Very puzzly. Some people will excel at it while others will be frustrated. I think I prefer La Boca in the end because I enjoy the teamwork necessary to complete the build. Here, you are on your own.

Fun timed competitive puzzle, but I'm sort of worried that it wouldn't have much staying power. It seems like once you get the hang of it it's pretty easy. After the first two rounds of a couple of small mistakes, for the last four rounds everyone in the game got all of the possible points. I guess it could have been a fluke and those last four sets of cards all worked out to be pretty easy, but either way that's not a good sign for the game.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (December 2015)

Before playing it, I haven’t even heard of Dimension so I’m not sure what to expect. After playing it I feel it is an ok and novel puzzle game.

The game components are gorgeous and they look great on the table. The rules are very easy to explain, you can do it under 10 minutes. Dimension is a simple game, making it perfect for the family.

The gameplay is also fast because it plays in real time (you have a minute to solve each puzzle). At first I felt the puzzles were way too easy, but some combinations of cards are harder to pull off, so that´s ok. It is an easy and light game.

I think it is best enjoyed as a 4 player game.
 
Bottom line, Dimension is a novel take on the puzzle genre, but it isn’t my kind of game. I’m open to playing it again, but I won’t actively seek more games of it. It is way too light for us, I feel its replay value is rather low. Its best feature is its short playtime. I think it can be a good family game, I wish the puzzles were a lot harder.

2016-07-11 - I did not expect to like this game. I thought it sounded like Fluxx: The Ball Stacking Game. It turned out to be a pretty great spatial puzzle with a time crunch, though.

Dimension is a really cool puzzle turned into a nifty little game.  There's truly no interaction between players, but the competition of making the most points with each creation is enough to make it interesting.  It's a lot harder than you may think, and I like how depending on how the cards deal out completely changes how the round plays out.  Pretty darn good game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
You each have 3 spheres of 4 different colours. Each round several cards are flipped up from a deck. Each card defines a rule that must be followed in the stacking of the spheres. For example black cannot touch red, or there must be 2 green spheres on the base level of the structure. The players race to build their stack while obeying all of the rules. There is a timer that ends this placement phase. Once done you score points based on how well you followed the rules.

[center][ImageID=2864870][/center]

[b]Fast-paced and boring[/b]
The placement phase might sound hectic, but we both found it to be far too easy to quickly satisfy all of the cards. Sometimes not all cards could be simultaneously followed and it was pretty easy to choose which card to ignore. Each round we both did things perfectly, there were no regrets except doing it faster which wasn't hugely compelling. 

In short the central mechanism completely failed for us. I could see a younger audience enjoying this more. Or perhaps those who need to improve their spatial reasoning skills. I'm also not keen on games with a real-time element in general. It just isn't my type of fun (although many are quick to point out that my type of fun is not usually considered fun).

A great brain puzzle that rewards good spatial thinking. Six task cards are laid out and each dictate certain rules that players must govern and build their 3D stackable spheres that are one of four colors.

This one can ask a little more out of your brain than you expect, but it is a lot of fun and provides some great tense moments.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

Fun logic puzzle game where you are stacking balls and trying to follow all 6 rules. Sometimes, rules will conflict and that's life. Points are lost for each rule not followed buy you do score 1 point for each ball placed as well. I've learned not to buy these puzzle games, but I'm always happy to play them.

I wasn't sure how much I would go for this, as I don't go fo abstract games usually, but it was a bunch of fun. You're given a set of colored balls and have to arrange them in a way to use as many as possible and satisfy a set of six random "rules" for them. The rules can sometimes contradict each other, which is fine. It's supposed to be timed but we dumped the timer and that didn't make much difference. A surprisingly fun game, though 100% anti-colorblind.

An abstract game where you put out 6 rules and try to organize balls into a stack of 11 and organize them in 1 minute to comply with all the rules.  If you get all the rules and all eleven balls you score 11 points and get a token.  At game end, you lose points if you don't get enough "complete all rules" tokens but gain if you get most or all of them. 

I liked the game, but I wonder if the game has long term replayability.  It is not that challenging a game at first and it seems that with a few plays, you could get all of the rules every time without too much difficulty.  

For non-gamers, this may be an excellent choice.

A rather basic stacking puzzle where everyone is solving the same puzzle simultaneously. Brings some fresh air to the genre by using balls as building pieces.

The rules for the bonus chips don't work out of the box, see the forums for a fix.

A simple and pure concept, very elegant. You have a minute to arrange your balls in such a way that the 6 flipped over rules governing placement of the balls for this round are all met, or as many as possible. But it has the same problem that all these timed games have - Set, Richochet Robot, Ubongo, ... - that the best player (usually the game owner, because they like and are good at this type of thing) should never lose, which reduces the attraction to other players of wanting to get it to the table. If you like this kind of thing, it's a nice addition to this genre, but the time element killed it for me in the end. There's too much reliance on time-pressure to make the game, and time-pressure sucked out the fun-factor too much for me.

First of all I love the game!

The purpose for this post is informative for people that are thinking of buying the game. 

Before buying I dreamt very heavy balls (like filled with sand) and with a high quallity rubber feeling. I was very disappointed as the balls are of medium weight and have that plain plastic feel.

Not cheap - but not classy.
Not light - just heavy enough so the game can be enjoyable

In short, the quality of the game components is just enough. There is no extra quality that will make you fall in love with it. 

I am more than happy I have this game in my collection... 
BUT 
... I bought it for 27 Euros as a special offer. If I have bought it in it's full price (around 48 euros) I would certainly feel cheated.

This game from Lauge Luchau is much like his other games Uluru and Xalapa. This one just doesn't really line up with the others and is much easier. I had a better time playing the other two. That being said, had I not played the others, I would have found this exciting. I love patten/ puzzle games and this does it well. I have traded my copy away.

Fun filler 3D building game. Make sure your pyramid matches the rules. Simple concept but harder to construct appropriately.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
A 3D puzzle game where you get 15 marbles (3 each of 5 colors), then 6 cards are flipped over that create the restrictions for that round, such as "white marbles can't be on the bottom," "there need to be exactly 4 green and blue marbles," "there can only be one black marble," and so on. Then you flip the timer and create a pile of marbles that satisfies the rules of the round. 

I have never played this against another person, and have no idea what that would entail. I honestly just leave this out on a table in my office and when I feel like taking a break, I deal myself 6 cards, flip the timer, and go. I can "solve" 4-5 logic puzzles in a few minutes, then go back to work. So this is a snack-sized solitaire logic-flavored diversion for me, and for that, it delivers. A logged play represents one day that I've done it, however many rounds I managed to play. Each play is probably between 2 and 10 separate instances of 6 cards, but I'm not going to inflate my play count that way; I'd be in the hundreds in no time.

I'm not a big fan of abstract games.  As far as abstracts go, this one is pretty fun.  I could easily be talked into playing this game, but it's probably not one I'm going to ask to play.

This is a game I'm probably going to recommend everyone try and it's one that most people are going to enjoy - there isn't really anything to dislike here.  I'm just not jumping out of my shoes to play it.

RATING: 6.5
The components are amazing.

But the game, at least for me, seems too easy. With 6 rules, I was putting together a full 11 ball structure that matched all 6 rules with half the sand timer left to go, most rounds. The only exception was when there was two rules that contradicted each other, so I wasn't allowed to meet all 6 cards, which seemed dumb, especially since there's the bonus tile rule which requires all 6 cards to be valid in order to be able to earn it at all.

If it weren't for the components being so good, I would definitely have gotten rid of this game with no regrets. But  I think I'm going to hang on to it, for now. I can see it being a really good game for kids to train their spatial capabilities, so in those situations it'd probably be a good game to bring.

My wife and I LOVE this game. It is strictly an exercise in working memory, attention to detail, and visual/spatial awareness as you attempt to stack spheres while also adhering to as many rules as possible to score the most points. This game is quick and easy to teach but it definitely appeals to a specific type of person.

A nice meld where light dexterity meets linear thinking meets puzzle-solving. Add the fact that there is usually more than one way to solve the puzzle...and you can solve it as much as you want (for less points). The box graphics make it look fun...the components and rules look complicated...then you play it and realize that it's easy and fun!

I love the idea of Dimension, and the components are just top notch beautiful.  The game itself is just so quick and I'm not sure it's too difficult, either.  Once the correct rules are used for bonus points it doesn't seem tough at all.  I'm up in the air about this one, but as a puzzle fan, I'd like to keep it around for a while.

1 round of the game, at Origins 2015 Kosmos booth

Very cool little puzzle game! You get a random collection of rules like in Uluru, specifying required relationships between balls of the various colors (nothing stacked on top, not touching a certain color, etc.). Under time pressure (60 sec?), arrange a subset of your colored spheres before time runs out. Then, get VP per ball in stack, but lose VP for every broken or skipped rule. If you managed to use a ball of every color, get a bonus chip. After 6 rounds, get/lose points based on the number of bonus chips you have. The player with the highest point total wins!

Simple rules, fun play. And the components are great: the balls feel nice, and the player boards have little holes and grooves cut out to hold everything in place ... awesome!

Funny thing, I don't like racing against the clock and other timed puzzle solving games have been frustrating. This, I like. You seem to be able to get things done by the the sand runs out, or maybe we weren't paying too much attention to the timer. I don't see this as a dexterity game; the balls sit in the cardboard template and are pretty stable. See also Dr. Eureka.

Rating Dimension a 7 optimistically.  It belongs to that special category of speed challenge games, but the little pyramidical construction with different colors of spheres generates challenges in spatial relationships that we haven't played with a lot previously.  So points for originality and for the feeling after one play that it'll be possible to improve in the skills necessary to score well.

tl;dr: decent, but there are better options

3D physical building game with a timer? Sounds right up my alley. I love games like those, especially [thing=46396][/thing]. So I expected to love this. But I didn't. The first game we were all quite tired, and it was quite challenging, but the second time that was not the case. It was a bit too simple. In the end it feels like a game that would work fine with families but for us, we'd rather play Ubongo 3D

I'm not normally crazy about this type of game, but I have to say that I'm impressed.

When you hear "timed dexterity game" you think of frantically trying to stack things as fast as possible before time runs out. In this game you usually have plenty of time to get things stacked, and then you can use the extra time to look over your stack and see if you can improve it to get more points. This makes the game feel much different from other timed dexterity games.

This does have the "problem" that most of these games has, though: if someone is really good at this type of spacial thinking, they will just win flat out.

This game is a fun puzzle and the six rounds go by pretty quickly, so I'll play this any time.

It looks cool, and it's fun for a few rounds (not games, rounds). Then everyone sees how to approach it and it becomes too simple; it's unfortunately about as easy as Uluru on the lowest or next-to-lowest level. 

More unfortunately, it doesn't include more difficult cards the way Uluru does. The rules suggest playing with more cards per round if you want to make it more difficult, which will help a bit, but I think it will get to be very repetitious that way (so would using a shorter timer, which the rules don't suggest but which would also help for a while).

To be really interesting I think this would need to number the balls in each color 1-3 and then include number-based cards, e.g. "a ball cannot be on a ball with a higher number." Maybe that will be an expansion. In the meantime, this might be decent with kids, but otherwise, get Xalapa.

Game is not truly Card-driven, but the card only augment the game. The cards seem to be either extremely unimportant or shamefully overpowered.  I think the game is a cut above average, but only a cut.  Disorganized rules make it a chore to learn, but probably worth learning.

Like some others, I expected it to be more historical.  The game is misnamed, in my opinion.

Was easy to learn and the flow of the game is great.  I think that it has alot of random events that can really impact play.  I felt like that I was always trying to play catch up the entire game after a random event.  This game is a good game for people wanting to get together and have some fun and something light.  Great multiplayer game.

RATING: 6
Decent game, but too long for my tastes, and a bit too much luck for a long game.  Lots of player screwing potential, and easy to bash the leader, with attacks giving an advantage to the attacker that grows bigger and bigger as the game progresses.    The theme feels kindof mismatched to the mechanics, you use technologies like Pro Sports and Television (I'm broadcasting Monday Night Football!), to beat down opponents.  It would make sense if it felt like economic competition, and there was coexistence in markets, but really, you're just attacking people and beating them down: its combat.  There are a number of interesting parts ot the game, such as the technologies/innovation abilities, some of the cards, and trying to manuever around the board to get certain commodities.    After not playing it for a couple weeks, I'm feeling interested in giving it another try at some point, it still feels interesting, so I'm increasing my rating a bit.

Very rough going. Rulebook leaves out rules and often text is subject to interpretation. Wooden pieces give the game an abstract feel. Would have prefered cardboard counters on a mounted board. On the plus side, for such a long game no player was eliminated from competition until the very end. Had it. Sold it.

I haven't played it yet, but have the following comments:
 
Wooden pieces on an unmounted board doesn't look a good idea to me. 12 pages of rules is way too much for a eurostyle game. A few more pages and you've got a real card-driven game. And I was hoping for a game that I can play on an evening with friends.

MD is certainly not a card-driven game. I think GMT will undermine this term (and their real card-driven strategy games) if they misuse it for marketing purposes.

The art on their cards look like clip-arts.

The mapboard is also disappointing. Look at the beautiful reliefs on Santa Fe Rails or The Sword of Rome.

Interesting "conquest" game with many nice (and some less nice) mechanics. Somewhat too talk-action based and beat-who-you-want spirited for me to like.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
After one play. The only things I knew about MD were that it was long (another player told me) and that it was card-driven (the box told me). Neither of these aspects constitute my gaming ideal. None-the-less I liked MD. 

The theme just lifts it away from euro-civ games, which I can find a bit staid and abstract. Strange really, because the theme to gamepaly match is undeniably sketchy in places, and I didn't really feel like I was moving through modern America's birth and development. 

There are cases against - the kingmaker issue (I was in last place in both profits and vps going in to the final round, but managed a win), and some of the cards seem overly harsh. As for luck, well if you're non-stop unlucky for 3-4 hours then there's not much anyone can say to make you like a game that involves that element. I certainly had mixed fortunes, even in the last turn, so my take is that luck is not necessarily the deciding factor.

More importantly, I think everyone at the table considered it a fun and worthwhile way to spend an afternoon.

Played twice.  Yet to get past the second phase in under five hours, but due in part to particular opponents.  Enjoyed the ride.  Bad dice and (particularly) cards can affect enjoyment.  Attacking is quick and simple and fairly well balanced (a trimmed down Risk solution).  Happy to play again.

Third game.  Played Depression which took leader into third at the end of the game.  Unsatisfactory ending to first full game which lasted 4+ hours.

Played once as a 3-player game with the rules explained to me.  The owner of the game laminated the progress mats and tried to spiff up the game with more usable components.  Even with the upgrades, I consider Manifest Destiny one of the ugliest looking games that I have played in some time.  On a positive note, the map and components are functional and easy to read.

Manifest Destiny is the only card-driven civilization game that I've played so far.  It offers a different type of experience than Advanced Civ or Through The Ages.  The other games mentioned suffer from excessive downtime, whereas Manifest Destiny moves at a faster pace and is more social.  The Main downside to Manifest Destiny is that the theme doesn't really work for me.  Mercantile Empires?  I understand the concept, but the conquest of the United States has evolved in ways not presented by this game.

>2 player Twilight Struggle.  Gets extra 0.5 for being before Twilight Struggle, and likely inspiring some decent mechanics for it.

It *almost* works, but has too many luck-factors that are simply too huge.  Namely:

-card numbers driving turn order sequencing 
-(combined with) only one Destiny card/turn being allowed across all players
-Lack of density of number of cards accessed across the game, combined with massive fluctuation in effects of the cards themselves.
-The way the "Wonders" work is possibly broken (again, combined with the card numbers driving turn order sequencing).

Enjoyable followup to Age of Renaissance by the same designer. Chief draws are a similar engine/play style but concludes in half the time-- or thereabouts. Unfortunately, the components and play aids are rather over done and inefficient. Awkward woodn cubes where flat disks would have sufficed (as in AoR) and four-color technology mats with cards used where a simple log-pad would have done the trick at a savings in cost to the producers. It's as if GMT were conciously trying to ape a "Euro" without quite understanding what a Euro really is. Still, it's fun, it's good, and players that enjoy Age of Renaissance should be happy that there is an alternative that won't be such a drain on time.

Update: Had opportunity to dust this game off recently and have modified my opinion slightly upward. With a full five player complement this game can be decent fun. I've gotten over my fit of pique with the thematic elements and try to just enjoy the overall thrust of exploration and expansion. While the labels on the technology range from serious to whimsical (still my view), the "progressions" and "break-throughs" altogether form an interesting system. I just wish that the "pioneers" that give you access to these things were called something different (inventors? researchers? innovators?) and weren't portrayed as coon-skin cap wearing explorers...

Somewhat revisionist take on the opening of the American West. Based on many of the same concepts as Age of Renaissance (itself a follow up to Civ) - up to five players explore, expand, exploit and (sometimes) exterminate across the map of North America. Technological development drives this game as in the earlier versions and is the source of the VPs that determines the winner. All else provides the wherewithal to purchase technological advances. Cards are used to confer advantages as well as economic gains towards success. The theme feels simply pasted on in this case but the game has been trimmed to be playable in a comfortable evening's session. Civ and AoR remain much better games but if you are pressed for time this could do...

Essentially a lighter (probably less well designed) Age
of Renaissance. It suffers from many of the same weaknesses,
though the decisions are easier - thus making it more palatable
to me to play.
The historical basis is not as strong; it's tough to 
decide just what a player represents (I think it's cultural
currents - but that falls apart more or less as the game 
progresses).

Quesiton: Who thought that doing a new Age of Renaissance would be a good idea? I mean, that older game was pretty dreadful, and now with the whole euro thing you'd think that people would have more sense. But hey, maybe not - Eagle seems to have done OK, but somehow I suspect GMT doesn't have Eagle's marketing clout. Given that I have come to despise Age of Renaissance, my desire to play this game is exactly zero. But I am curious to see if it as at least marginally less awful than the original, so maybe some friends will play it and let me know.

[20/04/05]

As others have remarked, there is an odd mismatch of theme and mechanics encompassing almost all aspects of the game. Given that players represent mercantile empires/interests one would expect shared regional control as seen in El Grande & Co rather than regions exclusively owned by a player in a Risk-fashion. While this might still make some sense in the era of the Dutch Westies Company or the English Charter Companies, this can hardly be said of later centuries. Risk-style competition is also more remiscent of combat than commercial rivalry. The cards and technological advances are similarly odd. The US War of Independence or the First World War are simple "take that" cards with little bearing to the said event. You're not reliving US history, but merely see various cards pop up named after some historical event or person. The names of several "breakthroughs" and advances (and their effects) are particularly odd. "Storytelling" (which really has been around since Adam&Eve) increases your hand size. "Tolerance" or the "Telephone" are instrumental for military (ahem...commercial) offensives.  This bizarre list doesn't stop there... :(

The game also fails to portray European settlement gradually progressing from East to West. It's more of a quick land-grab in the first era followed by players then ganging up on the perceived leader. Little to do with US history. But then, that goes for the entire game.  Might have been just as well about imperial powers and the Scramble for Africa. 

Here we come to another flaw of Manifest  Destiny. Bashing the leader simply is far too easy. Offensive combat (err...commercial rivalry) is ridiculously easy, particularly for those who've acquired those advances further favouring the attacker, while the defender cannot do much to improve his defences. Oh, and did I mention that geography later is of no importance as players are allowed to attack anywhere...? 

Okay, the "military" aspect of the game may be a dumbed down and unbalanced version of Risk, but what of the rest?

The Cards? Well, they don't do US history much justice as detailed above. They just add a hand management aspect, bonuses and a hose factor. Alternative choices are in there as well - as with the card-driven wargames GMT excels in
- but generally the plain event is taken. I believe the designer should have either done away with the cards or made it genuinely card-driven. As it is, I find it happens to be in the uncomfortable ground between the two many old-fashioned games may be found in.

The breakthroughs and progresses are largely where the VPs are to be obtained. Any strategic depth here? Not much. Buy dice (called "pioneers" - again an odd name) to roll for chances for a breakthrough. Gee, let me play Yahtzee instead... 

Downtime. Quite frankly, there is simply too little interaction here. 

Clearly Bill Crenshaw (the designer) has  missed the train on elegant game design eurogames excel in. Consider dull turn order choice determination. Ever heard of the auction mechanism?

BOTTOM LINE: This game has nothing to offer compared to the infinitely better Struggle of Empires, which does a far better (and thematically cohesive) job of portraying territorial rivalry coupled with technological
and administrative advances. Way more strategic depth, interaction, elegance, balance, theme, while taking less time to play. 

Manifest Destiny might have gained a loyal following in the 80s, but nowadays it cannot compete with the many superior games out there. No wonder this game had difficulty successfully graduating from GMT's P500 programe. Not that IMHO it deserved to. Worst game I've played for a considerable time.

I think some of those I played with though that this would be more of a wargame than expected.  At the same time, it is not a "development game" either; it is sort of a mix.  

The game system can be tiresome if one is not in the right mood and at times it can crawl, but if players get into the flow of the game nearly anyone can win.  This can be loads of fun if everyone is in the right mood. (a drag otherwise).

OK, here's what sucks.  1) There is absolutely no reason that this game should use wooden blocks rather than more functional counters other than to trick blubbering, balding spielfrieks into thinking this is a "German-style" game. 2) There is no reason a $55 game shouldn't include a mounted board.  GMT says "production costs", I say "made in China". 3) There is a weird disconnect between the theme and what you are actually doing in the game- mercantile empires vying for territory in the US?  Weird. 4) Despite the game being specific enought to mention Elvis and PT Barnum, there is no mention or representation of Native American removal and genocide other than some natives that turn up in Hawaii.  The removal of Native Americans was a big part of "manifest destiny" sot it comes across to me at least rather like an economic simulation of WWII Germany that doesn't mention the Holocaust. 5) The rule book is terrible, but not worse than the AoR one.  It's an easy game to explain and play, but the rule book makes it seem like Magic Realm.  6) Microsoft Word clip art- no excuse.

OK, that's off my chest...this is an excellent, satisfying, and nourishing game that is *gasp* long and *gasp* detailed.  This is not El Grande.  The Age of Renaissance system is largely intact but most of the paperwork is thankfully scrapped and some game functions are combined to streamline play.  It isn't really any shorter, but I do think it's more playable and manageable.  As far as the "one die roll decides the game" business...it _can_ happen, but what's more the case is that players of equal skill will likely finish around the same score and it could come down to rolling on the breakthrough tables.  With more experience and deeper strategies, I think there will be a bigger gap between scores.  I play games like this more for the experience of it than the win, so it's neither here nor there for me.  Excellent work all things considered.

RATING: 8
This is a interesting descendant of Civilization and from I what have read Age of Renaissance (which I have not played yet). I like the building/expansion aspect of it, as well as the cards which really are the best part of the game. The cards are used as events that effect the game as well as for the paying out of resources. When you play a card for resources anyone in the game with those resources will earn money. A good portion of the cards are there to screw with your opponents, so if that is not your cup of tea, beware (it happens to my cup though). There are a couple of cards that can block some of the nastiness.

The wooden pieces are nice, but I think the black & white stickers for them leave a lot to be desired. Couldn't GMT come up with some more interesting graphics for the blocks? I mean come one, the little square white stickers with letters on them like "P" for purple to put on the purple block are just silly. Skip the letter and just use a white sticker. I don't need the dumb letter to tell me the block is purple. I can see in 3 dimensions for Christ's sake! I am thinking of just painting one side of each block white would work nicely. There are some color stickers available here on The Geek though use can use for replacements.

I also think combination of nice thick card board tiles and wooden pieces would have been nicer. 

The theme does not thrill me. I know medieval stuff is over done and most likely the author want to try something different. I applaud him for that, but mercantile growth in the Americas does not really work for me. With the different regions of America under control of different players I almost feel like I am playing some wacky out version of Shattered States.

Please don't let my negative comments deter you too much though, as most of it is just differences in opinion in personal aesthetics. I enjoyed playing this game immensely both pbem and in person and look forward to the next time I get to play it.

The game is card driven and they are interesting, but some just appear to be way out of balance with a number of other cards seemingly underwhelming in comparison. Card combinations can be lethal and can allow a player to pull themselves back to the pack, but if some key cards are not played, the early leaders stay in the lead. (Such as Remember the Alamo, Gold Rush, and Indigenous Sovereignty.)

GMT Games.  Manifest Destiny is a good game of expansion, territorial conquest and technological innovation.  I liken the game to a Age of Renaissance "light" in a loose sense.  The game is fun to play and takes 3 -5 hours from start to finish.  This is a heavy euro style game.  This game's map board represents North America and has starts during the 1800s during the United States expansion westward.

A good game marred by schizophrenic components and rules only someone familiar with Age of Renaissance can understand. The Breakthrough mechanism will see an occasional game decided by a dice roll, but otherwise it's much improved in terms of complexity and speed of play over AoR.

Billed as a sort of light version of [i]Age of Renaissance[/i]. At least in theory. In practice, the multiple phases, with multiple activities happening in each phase, combined with some required pre-planning and multiple combats, brought the game to a snail's pace for my AP prone euro crowd.

Too many elements are just too clumsy in practice. A less than stellar rulebook does not help matters, and we had to rely heavily on the FAQ and online errata just to stumble through it. The physical components are weak, too. Stickers on 20mm cubes? Weird choice by GMT.

To cap it all off, the combat is a crapshoot, not much different than [i]Risk[/i] really. It's thematically disconnected from the game, but I guess you're supposed to think of the conquests as some sort of hostile takeover. This by itself isn't a showstopper, but it definitely feels odd.

On top of that, I found it difficult to get out of a death spiral where I couldn't afford cubes because I couldn't get territory, and I couldn't get territory because I couldn't get cubes. There's no catchup mechanism, so once you're down, it's extremely unlikely that you're ever going to come back, only you get to sit through half the game with no chance to win. Ugh. 

So, on the whole, wanted to like it more, but it has too many issues and just takes too long for what it is.

Players colonise the Americas.  Basically an expansion game with some nice cash and resource management elements.  Borrows heavily from Age of Renaissance.  Essentially a RISK combat system layered on which comes into play about half way through.  Strong event card deck can throw a lot of chaos into the mix.  Victory goes to the players who make the most advances/breakthroughs.  Four hours, but enjoyable if the mood is upon me.

This was just a dull game for me, as is Age of Ren.  Not sure what people see here.  

Played Manifest Agony again recently (2016) to give it another shot after 10 years away from it, and was still this game gets worse with age.  It is simply horrible.  I'm still bewildered why some people find this game appealing in any sense.  Rock and Roll, Tourist, Professional Sports???  They have nothing to do with the 1800's and Manifest Destiny.

RATING: 7
Definitely not bad at all. It's tuff to rate because it has sort of a strange history.  It's kind of sequel to Age of Ren which is kind of a sequel to Civilization.  The entire time I was playing it I enjoyed the civ building aspects, and the Age of Ren card play and phase ideas.  All of these were enjoyable and fun to play for the entire length BUT I couldn't help but think that the creation of America wasn't really like Civ or Age of Ren.

The AoR system is unique and sort of abstract.  It makes AoR the special game that it is, but really the story it tells of history is very strange using the battle market concept.  America and it's creation and expansion while perhaps market driven doesn't really completely tell it's history.  There's so much more unique stuff about the Manifest Destiny story.  

If you look at the GMT game as just being about the marketing angle it's really a fine game.  The competitive rolls, as in AoR, are a bit strange and seem more like real battles rather than economic stuff.  The remarkable events of American history are brushed over and are more discounts on buying stuff and possible losing money issues, but never really what the events meant to me.  But as a free marketeer it's probably what these event were...maybe.  I dunno, I'm a gamer looking at American History not a marketeer.

Update:  After looking at my comment, I rate my comment a 5.  I've basically repeated the exact same paragraph 3 times.  I'll keep this because it makes me laugh.  Also just finished another game.  Still think it's a great AoR fix in 4 hours.

This was supposed to be the 'next' Age of Renaissance (which is my favorite game), but it didn't live up to the expectations.  The game isn't bad, but I don't think it was playtested enough (eventhough I think it was in development for years).  We played half a dozen times and I made a couple simple house rules to make it better, but if I wanted to play a game like this, I would just play Age of Renaissance!

RATING: 4
The gameplay is not completely bad, but the game itself makes no sense at all. What do players represent? Are there any historical counterparts to these "Mercantile Empires" that single-handedly control vast sections of the continent? No. It's a bit long and convoluted for a game that is not really a simulation of anything. 

Also, it seems that the idea is to "monopolize" a commodity and then deftly play a card to cash in. With all the rules devoted to it, it seems like this would be a main mechanic in the game. Yet it will rarely happen. You simply don't go through enough cards for this to normally happen, except by dumb luck.

Perhaps GMT's worst game since the advent of the P500 system.

I spent the time to read the negatives on this game just after playing it. I didn't struggle with the rulebook as some did, but admit it could have been laid out better.

I agree that the map is cheesy and for the price ought to have been mounted. 

Overall I found this to be a great way to spend precious gaming hours. Carping about luck is pointless, GMT didn't hide the fact that both dice and cards are components of the game, go play something else if a bad die roll ruins your experience.

Kingmaking could come into play, but there are ample opportunities to knock back an early or mid-game leader and savy players will cajole and coax reluctant players into using the screwage opportunities correctly. And that's one of my favorite things about Manifest Destiny and games like it, you really can thwart your enemies. Perhaps it'll bring you to victory, perhaps not, but it can be done. Knowing the cards, understanding a bit about why the game accelerates the last few turns, holding cash, control or card powers in reserve, that's how to counter bad dice, runaway leaders and those shooting for 2nd place.

This is a great empire-building game and even though several hours are needed it didn't drain me like some games do. Nice job.

RATING: 7
The endless search for the ultimately playable Civilization/AoR clone is continuing, even after this game. But Manifest Destiny gets some things right: a) it really approaches a manageable game length (3-4 hours) b) some mechanics are quite good (control tokens metamorphing into pioneers, cities, cards)and the game is quite easily learned (although not necessarily when reading the rules) c) territorial control is not the only key to winning. Some of the cards have the typical American game illness: "Take that"! - and it's not even necessary, as there are enough ways to mess with other players, either by competition on the breakthrough chart or by territorial conquest or by fiddling with the turn order. The "lose half of your profit in cash" card is especially annoying, even if played against the leader it comes with the smell of "kingmaking". Still, not an uninteresting effort by GMT.

Pretty good game.  My only gripe is that there is a significant amount of luck and chaos for what is a 5-6 hour game.  If you don't get the right cards (and some good dice rolls too), you will have a VERY tough time winning.

I have played one game, and it does have a quite similar feel to AoR.  However, there are some distinct differences (payout cards having other possible uses, more 'combat' oriented, income on entirely dependant upon control markets).  It is an enjoyable game, and I am looking forward to playing again.

RATING: 4
After a few plays, my desire to play this game just declines. Although a Euro-like design, the mechanism is clunky. The aim to achieve 30 VPs can also result in futile game play, when one player will clearly achieve the victory regardless of what other players do. Quite unsatisfying in that regard.

Biggest drawback: the game components are just bad, and this is not just gratuitous ranting. For example, the cubes, especially the blue and green ones, blend right into one another on the board, especially when there are lots of them, and makes counting the cubes a visual nightmare.

Still a ten but with a few asterisks. The mechanics are great and the game did the job of being a more manageable AoR. 

The production is not great. Here's my wish list for if this ever is reprinted:

- artwork overhaul. Like anything else would be better. 
- mounted map, obvi. 
- no player mat. I do not understand why this was needed. How about cards like in civilization? Put the pioneers on the board somewhere. Just remember the profit bonus when you buy one of each in the first or second tier!!! 

For me, these visual elements don't matter too much but, as as sequel to AoR this should have been better. I also understand that the market for people who actually want a sequel to AoR is relatively low. :(

RATING: 8
This is the kind of game most players are not going to grok on the first play, due to the various rules exceptions and special cases; however, this is worth putting the effort in to learn and play.

Like other card-driven strategies, knowing what is on the cards helps, so I would recommend using copious player aids.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Really like a lot of things in this game, but there are some features that keep it from becoming a favorite: screw-the-leader cards that allow people to go after the leader not by adjusting their strategy but by simply playing the card, arbitrary limitations on Progression and Breakthrough acquisition that constrain creative approaches, interesting abilities that can only be acquired too late in the game to be useful for anything other than the victory points that come with them, and some imbalances in the cards which can make a bad draw devastating (e.g Teddy Roosevelt v. Civil War).   

Update: I'm losing faith that there is much connection between playing well and winning.  By "well" I mean increasing profit, earning big payouts, and achieving breakthroughs, all while preventing other players from doing the same.  In this game, playing 'well' really means being mediocre throughout so no one picks on you, then lucking into convenient product payout cards or unlikely breakthrough rolls in the last couple of turns while the leader of the moment is pounded.  When the best strategy for a game is to do nothing particularly well, then it is a bit too 'gamey' for me.  This is perhaps reasonable in a game like Powergrid, where efficient timing seems to be the whole point, but the inflexibility inherent in the must-play card system (hand limits, Era limits) makes timing your surge for the end of the game a matter of luck rather than strategy.  This is the first game I've ever considered re-theming just for the chance to fix perceived flaws and turn it into a '10'.

Capsule comment: Definitely try it if you like kingmaker games 

If you don't like "kingmaker" games [games in which players hold much power to determine which other player wins], then this game probably isn't for you.  It seems like there is so much incentive and opportunity to "bash the leader" in VP, $, or territories with attacks and cards that you spend much of your time trying to convince people to bash others beside yourself. 

The endgame features enormously powerful cards which can totally wreck another player's chances of winning, or provide bountiful cash to insure victory for others.  If you don't enjoy other players holding your fate in their hands with a single card, then don't play this one.

Despite what another reviewer claimed, attackers have better than half a chance of winning early on, and everyone increases their attack chances so dramatically by the endgame through developments (there is nothing that helps defense ever) that attacks are virtually unstoppable in the late game [In third era, most have the developments which let attacker roll 3 dice vs. defender's 1 die, and attacker wins ties!] This just doesn't seem right to me.

Like a few other comments mentioned,
production happened so rarely that it was never much of a big factor in the game I played; of course that might be different in different groups.

All that being said, Manifest Destiny is interesting enough for what it is. There are enough interesting choices with cards, progressions, and territory expansion to make it enjoyable to play once at least to try.

 If you like kingmaker style games, you'll definitely like this one.  If, like me, you don't enjoy kingmaker games much, you should pass on this one.

RATING: 6
A hybrid between euros and wargames; however, the wargame elements are decidedly non-traditional. Defense is effectively pointless, and offense is often limited only by restrictions based on turn order or piece limitations. As in other weuros, victory is only loosely tied to the conquest elements, so overall the unusual approach makes an interesting, though not great, game.

A poor man's Age of Renaissance.  I say that because Age of Ren is oop and expensive.  This game is similar in many ways.  A little simpler to play in some areas.  That's not a bad thing.

It's arbitrary, and it has lots of whacking the leader. The cards are all over the place--some are hugely powerful in almost all circumstances, some painfully restricted, and some pretty much useless.

Really gaining support from my group who have traditionally loved ACiv.  Much shorter playtime and keeping all players in the game makes for a better gaming experience, IMO.  Not a better game than ACiv, but a better game experience.  Some cons: potential wild swings at endgame (the price you pay for having all players still competing for a win); also, sometimes you can be in the lead on the last turn and just by the cards in your hand you know you have no chance to win.

On the whole, I will not hesitate to have a game when got enough players and about 3 hours.

Manifest Destiny is a guilty pleasure. It's massively random, has significant leader bashing, and is thematically absurd. Yet there are aspects that I find very enjoyable: the big deck of event cards, managing and playing into your hand, the tight money and cube management, the technology upgrades. And actually, the wild swings of fortune prevent players from being effectively eliminated early in the game (a notable problem of this game's forebearer, Age of Rennaissance). At low player counts especially (Manifest Destiny plays particularly well with three), with a three hour playing time, I really dig the occasional play of Manifest Destiny. Just don't expect the outcome to always be determined by skill.

I'm lowering it a point and I really just don't think it's worth the time involved.  There are several systems in this game that make me really enjoy myself at times.  But there's really painfully things going on as well that make the game a little crazy.  I will be selling my copy.

The theme is a little shakey at times (how can developing Pro-Sports make you better at capturing cities?). It is also long, 4.5 hours, and a badly worded card, the Internet card – funnily enough, wrecked my game. Otherwise, this was very enjoyable. It is not particularly dense, after a while it felt quite freewheeling.

I adore Age of Renaissance, so what happened here?  Why don't I like this more?  Perhaps I need to be dropped on my head again, but it seems like defense is even harder to play in this game than in AoR, and that's a shame.  I also miss the accounting, which makes me probably the only person to do so.

I really enjoyed my first playing of this game.  It will definitely pay to play this a few times just to get to know the cards and possible interactions a lot better. All the possibilties with the cards was a bit tough to figure out in the 1st game. 

Still, I have to wonder, once you get to know the cards and the interactions how much will I want to play this?  The goals will always be the same, mostly buying progressions with a few bonus points to be gained by take chances on breakthroughs and hoping for the most cities. There may be many different paths to victory but it always comes down the same goal, buying the most stuff. I guess only time can tell. It seems that during every play we have a lot of questions. We played some things incorrectly and had to make a few rule decisions ourselves. Even the FAQ didn't always help.

RATING: 6.5
I really enjoy card-driven games.  The first 2/3 of this game are fantastic, but the path to victory appears to be very chaotic.  In one of our games, it was difficult to tell who the actual leader was, especially due to having to keep track of the # of cities.  The game also favors the attacker, the longer you go.

Good game that I'd like to play every couple of years.

Manifest Destiny is an attempt to deliver the Age of Renaissance experience in a shorter and more accessible package.  To that end the card deck is reduced in size, the number of advances is reduced from 26 to 15, the map is smaller, and the player count reduced.

I think in general Manifest Destiny succeeds best where it deviates from Age of Renaissance most.  The Profit track is clever and much less fiddly than the counter sheet in AoR.  I don't usually mind fiddle but less is still better than more.  Expansion phases go more quickly in Manifest Destiny due to the more compact map, and the die rolls are simplified, reducing the brain burn as players try to decipher the results on every competition.  Manifest Destiny also appears to have fixed the runaway leader problem from AoR through massive attacker advantages and the Safety Net tech, which gives extra income to those in last place on the income track.  The Pioneers and Cities tracks are a brilliant extension of the card purchasing mechanic, and the breakthroughs may be the truest version of the PC Civilization "wonder" idea ever printed in a board game.

I do have a serious objection to the Destiny cards, however.  I think they are an interesting idea which thematically define the powers better than in AoR.  But the time pressure to play them just doesn't work for me - certain players get dragged into the muck of playing this sort of Euro-timing game with turn order while others are able to skate by due to having drawn high-numbered cards on the early turns.  It's capricious, random, and not at all fun for the player who gets left out.  It isn't game killing for the victim at least but it's a dagger into the heart of the game's theme, which is already a bit tenuous.

It's hardly surprising that the game feels light - perhaps not in an absolute sense, but relative to its predecessors.  I'm guardedly positive but I'd rather play Age of Renaissance any time.

RATING: 7
a fun game with a lot of different things going on - developing progress items, research breakthrough tech, expand territorial control, build cities and try to gain control of resources. Longer than expected, and the rules are not as well written as they should be - there are still some issues we need to resolve. And there is some screwage potential. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
An odd game that pretends to be strategic and plays as long as a grand strategy or civ-building game, but which is almost completely tactical in feel. There simply don't seem to be many real "strategies" in the game. It is really a series of short-term bursts of expansion to gain profits, followed by the inevitable whittling away of gains as the next player expands - wash, rinse, and repeat until someone reaches 30 victory points and hope you have the best cards in your hand at the end of the game. The cards are quite unbalanced - some are incredibly powerful while others can be next to useless. Finally, there is a seriously bad mismatch between theme and gameplay. I had no sense of building a commercial empire, or building anything permanent for that matter. I felt more like a Viking - raiding and plundering areas for their riches in the short term, with no expectation of actually controlling many of those areas for any length of time. If the game played in 2 hours or less I would likely rate it higher. For a game that takes 4+ hours I expected something much meatier and more strategic in feel. A real disappointment.

Manifest Destiny is a shorter version of Age of Renaissance set in North America, ~1700 to present. I'm being literal here: this really is the same game with a lot of small tweaks and a new theme.

This is one of those rare games that clearly isn't that great but is somehow entertaining anyway. There are lots of rough edges. There's a variable turn order that players have questionable impact on. The theme is borderline parody. To wit, we had Kennedy and Lincoln show up within 10 seconds of one another, and this is a three hour game. Early on, I fell behind in the race to build income, so I focused my efforts on the "safety net" development (as in: Social Security, Medicare, etc.), which I had in place well before the Civil War. Those constant government bailouts - I stayed in last on purpose - almost won me the game. Which brings me to one of the game's oddities: the mechanics encourage a lot of attacking "market competition," which in turn seems to encourage cycles of leader-bashing. But since I was cordoned off in the Southeast with my tobacco farms (I started role-playing the embittered plantation aristocracy - even got to play the "Racial Unrest" card at one point), I didn't even try to pay the costs of "competing," instead investing my more meager but also more steady earnings into constant development. I even developed the motion pictures industry - can you say "Birth of a Nation?" The winner of the game was the player who played somewhat aggressively without ever being the clear target. The three players behind us all took their turns out in front.

Absurd, rough, and somehow charming game.

A ride of a game;  Lots of dice rolls, to be sure, but lots to think about as well.  Given it's length, I think it's a fun ride, with little downtime.  The development could have been tweaked a bit, but creative minds can overcome the shortcomings.  Recommended.

RATING: 7
North America from colonial times to the present...hmmm...sounds interesting.  But does it offer historical insights? The map on the entire U.S., however, is gorgeous and eye catching. 

We had Manifest Destiny for a 4-players game. Haven't got it completed as 2 of them had to leave early. The MEX player was replaced by a new joiner. The previous MEX player had already swung out to Central America and northward along the west coast. He was in the lead already when he left. So the game victory was awarded to the MEX player. 

Our group seemed to enjoy the game very much, although the game was a bit mechanical to me. However, it is the reason why the game was straight-forward and easy to pick up and go. The Euro turn order choice is an off-beat to me as I still don't know how to figure whether I should go earlier or later. Besides, the randomness of the cards played by the players to determine the turn order was also something I felt I couldn't control. 

You play the cards and then invest in control tokens which are used for expansion. The speed of expansion depends on the investments you have made e.g. telegraph and railroad can speed up your expansion from your home country as well as un-controlled region while you had established a presence in the region. The investment in telephone can boost your attack roll to 3 dices (vs. 2). The defender always roll only 1 dice unless he has a city in the defending region (add 1 dice). Tie roll goes to the defender. 

I was in Louisianas and was hiccuped by the Virginians and Pensylvanians to the north next door as they expanded westward. To the west the natives sprouted up. I bid $5 for the state in the beginning because of the Louisianas Purchase card. But I think this was not a good investment bid. 

I therefore invested heavily in the cities to defend myself. However, you can't win the game simply going on the defensive. The investment in progression is a pure luck to me (rolling a die for each pioneer available) that matches the no. on the Progression mat. Collaborations with other players should always be done in order to progress faster once you and another player both have the "Unity" card.

RATING: 4
Long and unpleasant. Reminds me of Die Macher, where you do the same thing repeatedly for 5 hours and at no point does it become fun or interesting. Mostly I just dislike the complete disconnect between what you're doing and actually winning. What exactly do all the shenanigans on the map accomplish? Why are the markets even there when they contribute almost nothing to the actual game? Why do sports teams help you fight against cities? Why ARE you fighting against cities? If it's not fighting, if it's more economic manipulation, then why not have money affect the outcome? Where the hell are the natives? Who exactly AM I? These would all be troubling questions if I cared at all about what was going on in the game, which I never did.

RATING: 3.5
A reasonably streamlined resources management game utterly wrecked by overpowerful card effects, especially if a combination occurs.
Once a player is down there is nothing to save them. Much worse than Civilisation, or Age of Renaissance.
Impossible to understand how this was missed in playtesting, unless all testers were close friends of the designer.

RATING: 6.75
An odd game.  I am a big Age of Renaissance fan, and this one is indeed a more streamlined version.  Not better, but streamlined.  The theme really didn't work too well for me: I mean, getting attack bonuses in Texas for having a sport team advance.  Also missing some elements of AoR I liked.  But the game as a game worked all right.

A subsequent play in '16 and I appreciates it a bit more.

I actually think the game is worth at least an 8; however, my general preference excludes games with combat systems and die roll dependencies.  These 2 elements create frustrating situations.

We love to play AoR, so this was a must have; impression after a 4-player game, which was cut after the 2nd epoch; several new mechanics, which let the game "flow" better than AoR; it´s interesting to learn about US-history by playing such event cards; short rules, but you have to know the interaction of several events and all those progressions; can´t wait to play (and learn) again ...

An excellent multi-player card-driven pseudo-wargame. It is about economic development in North America but it certainly has a martial air about it as you can take over opponents areas in quite an aggressive fashion. Graphically rather bland but functional.

Simplified Age of Rennaisance but in the Americas instead of Europe.  Elegant card based game with many balancing mechanisms.   We need more games like this with an economic/historical theme.  Masterfully done.  This game is a delight to play for me.  Will never tire of it.  So many neat mechanisms.  I love CDGs.  End of story.  The only reason this one is not a 10 for me is because I've sometimes seen players have poor card draw and it does effect game play in a serious way for those players but this does tend to balance out over the course of the game as in most CDGs, but not always and those situations are unfortunate to watch.  The theme and gameplay far outweigh these rare negatives for me and I still very much enjoy playing this game.

Wow, this game is a real gem and deserves some love. Players of Paths of Glory will feel at home as it is like a lighter commerce version of that, and 3-5 players opens it up to a wider audience.

I'll admit I was predisposed to disliking this game due to length in the end that wasn't the reason for the low rating.  As a whole, I wasn't pleased by the cards.  I feel they varied in strength too much, some were too negative and in a few cases ambiguous.  The other part that disappointed me what the 'production system'.  While it SEEMS significant, in reality production rarely happens as most times the players will choose then action rather than production.
The breakthrough and progress mats end up being the meat of the game as they are the best source of VPs.  And while I liked them overall, I felt they could be better.
Lastly, the inconsist clip art kept bugging me.  Having one artist create all the visuals in a consistent, and theme appropriate manner would have been a big plus to me.

Supposedly a faster player version of AH's Age of Renaissance. The rule book is terrible, incomplete and confusing. Only 5-player game took 5 hours, the 3 eras (like AoR) are at least one too many! Screwage and whining abounded. I'll pass, AoR is definitely better for the time spent.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
An enjoyable game. 
It has a lot of different activities, I like how controlling territory is a means to the end, but not the objective. It is how you get resources but it is not how you score victory. The resources you acquire must be split between getting victory points or improving your position to acquire more resources. The trick is to find the right balance.

On the downside the theme seems to detract from game play - the two just didn't seem to mesh well. I guess it is a matter of expectations - I expected more of a historical progression game, something like Britannia with economics or as indicated Age of Renaissance. While the notes indicate the theme was of the gilded age with industrialists vying for markets, the card events should have matched it better.

RATING: 7.7
--Aug2011-- Much more delightful than I'd expected.  I'd understood that it was a reimplementation-of-sorts of [i]Age of Renaissance[/i] - a game I'd owned for a few years without being able to come to an accommodation with the rules.  So I'd been (incorrectly, as it happens) worried that this one would be similarly incomprehensible.  In contrast to my expectations, it played cleanly and amusingly.  I had fun the first time out, and would be happy to play again.
--Sep2011-- Bought a copy.
--Apr2014-- I've momentarily got this one ranked above [thing=26][/thing]; though I'm not confident that'll be their final resting place.  The streamlined nature of this one is excellent; but the epic scope (and European setting) of the other is more to my taste.

Much chaos and hit the leader. Entertaining and well themed, but at three hours it just runs a little long for my taste for an offensive game with game swinging powerful cards and an attacker advantage. I don't mind it, but I'd rank several other games above it on my list of games I desire to play.

RATING: 6
 A very long game that I don't see hitting the table again. I sold my copy off. It had a lot of promise and the first 3/4 of the game is exciting and tense, but as the end game approaches, offenses get stronger and defence weakens. At the very end you can take and (lose) just about as many areas as you can attack.
 The end game was my biggest disappointment here.

A very good adaptation of 'The age of Renaissance' to the modern period in the US.

A lighter and shorter game than AoR (5-hour-games).

Some random with the cards and a less deep arborescence of the progress cards, whose effects are very similar reduces the long term strategies.

Good amount of randomness to keep things interesting. Not knowing when the payouts are coming, the rolling for research and attacks, the bonuses the advancements, so much in your control and yet so much not.

Probably a more fun game to watch than to play.  I've never seen any kind of wargame that abstracts "warfare" to cultural slings and arrows instead of actual howitzers, nor have I seen any game that so favors the aggressor.  Random cards can easily make or break you, and being hot on the dice trumps any real strategy.  The theme is rich, however, and the constant backstabbing makes for an entertaining, if profanity-laced session.  I only wish GMT would produce higher-quality boards and bits.

Good theme play.  Fairly easy to learn and play.  Some interesting decsions and tense play, but there do not appear to be many different paths to victory.  Need more plays to determine. Components Fair at best - paper map board, cardstock mat, wood playing pieces, somewhat durable cards.  Artwork almost nonexistant.  Game length is about 3.5 hours which is a bit long.

Having no experience with AoR, I couldn't figure this one out for the life of me. Terrible rule book, the 15 page FAQ/clarification/errata file on the GMT website tells it all. The clunky design just doesn't come together at all as there are so many disconnects. I keep hearing there's a great game in there somewhere, but damned if I can find it. 

After years on the shelf, I tried a second look at this game and it was even worse than I remember. 

What a stinker.

This one was as enjoyable as the predecessor, with a short playtime. I'd guess the 3 hours mentioned on the box might be a little short, but you should be able to finish in 4 with a full game.

Turn order is a bit more arbitrary than in AoR, but then we never really played cards for turn order purposes, maybe that is viable/necessary. Also forgot about the priority turn option..

This one isn't bad as far as empire-building games go, and in fact is probably better than most.

It has its flaws, but it's fun.  It fits nicely into the time it's slated for, not overstaying its welcome, but keeping you engaged for the entire 4-5 hours.  Wildly, caustically given to dramatic swings of scores and significant screw-the-leader.  The whims of fate and the other players are going to see your score marker on a roller coaster ride from last to first and back again.  Winning the game is as much about timing your surge into first place as it is about building your economy up.  I do enjoy the theme of American history, even if the name of "Manifest Destiny" is somewhat idiosyncratic with Corporations -- I tend to think of Manifest Destiny as a top-down policy enforced by our government, not dictated by the powerful corporations that we see meddling with politics now.  But perhaps that's naivete on my part.  Either way, it's pretty neat to see the cards come out and the board get developed as the era track marches on.

Oh, and the clipart really IS that bad.  For shame, GMT!  No wonder people criticize you for bad components!  Sure, the game is nice and cheap, but it shows in some REALLY amateur ways.

A multi-player CDG that takes place on a U.S. map sounds like it would be awesome, but in practice I found the experience a little tiresome. I guess the game is good for its audience- I just found there weren't enough decisions that felt engaging or important to justify the time investment (about 1 hour per player), which was exacerbated by the whole processional order of events each turn... perhaps I am too accustomed to Euros where decision angst and pacing are given greater priority. I just don't derive that much pleasure from games where a lot of the time is spent rolling dice to resolve situations (in this case battles between players or attempts at tech advances)

Fun game, but I feel it is too luck dependent - not with the dice rolls for competition and breakthroughs, but on the card draws. Having so few cards, there is a good chance that you won't have any that really help you, other than by hurting others more. Fortunately, the game is short enough so as to still be fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Not a bad game, but there are plenty of other games I would prefer to play.  The game is very random.  First, there are very few powerful cards.  In the two games played, these cards tended to be concentrated in the hands of a couple of people.  Second, the game favors the attack to a very large extent.  It is almost impossible to protect your position on the board.  Third, what happens on the board has little impact on what is happening on the scoreboard.  

The last issue is what bothers me most about the game.  I was getting pounded on the board, but I was able to win the game.  The player who came second was also getting pounded on the board.  

It wouldn't be bad if the game was only a 2-3 hour affair, but when we are looking at a 4-6 hour game, it is a show stopper.

Based on 1 play. Never played AoR so I can't compare. It was long, but it was a lot of fun. Defending your stuff seems nearly impossible though. Lost 29-30 when I was $10 short on my last turn from the needed progression to win. If only I'd taken one more city on the last expansion phase!

But really long, pretty random, not something I'll ever play again.

Son of Age of Renaissance and grandson of Civilization.  The game is easier to play than the rule book makes it seem.  I definitely like Civilization better, but this is shorter (though by no means short).  I'll have to play more to decide whether I like this or AoR more.  Nice use of theme.  One play with 5 players.

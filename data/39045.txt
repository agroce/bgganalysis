Have played once. I really like this game for what it is. I think the components and the theme might suggest a more complex game then it is. Very simple to learn and has a good flow to it. Highly reccomended for families. Not recommended for anyone looking for a highly strategic game.

Good for teaching famous world leaders, scientists, etc to children.  Easy to learn and fun to play.  Minor conflict with minimal war actions (not as brutal as Risk).

This game is very underrated.

Light area control game with small amount of combat. Feel with 2 or three played more warmonger players may want to double the combat values so that they have more effect.

Good with children as game as title suggests has a large amount of historical references.

Unexciting area control game. Huge luck swings on dice rolls (the difference between assimilation and resistance is huge) and completing the scoring in a region is a hge advantage. Yawn.

A Nobrainer. If you have a son, 15 years old, he like to play risk, then is heroes a wonderful game. It's a "Mehrheitenspiel" as we say in German, not a Wargame and so, I like it.

RATING: 4
This is probably aimed at kids rather than adults. As a children's game it's 'ok' but nothing special. For adults quite poor.

Area majority with drafting - better with 3 than 5, there is a definite turn order advantage (going later in a 5 player game is definitely not fun). There's little chance of a strategic plan - just optimise your turn and hope others get targetted rather than you. Sounded quite good in principle but in play was an unpleasant mix of frustration (caused by chaos) and tedium.

Missed opportunity :( I'd play it again (with kids most likely) but no desire to own a copy.

In 2 tijdsvakken (Ancient en Modern) scoren de spelers punten door historische figurenkaarten uit te spelen die elk verbonden zijn met specifieke regio(s). Deze kaarten laten toe om aantal legers te plaatsen, eventueel een aantal ontdekkingen te doen die in de vakjes gelegd worden van de regio(s) waar de figuur invloed heeft, een aanval te plaatsen, en geld te verwerven. Er zijn ook wonderkaarten die in de moderne tijd zwaar kunnen doorwegen. De ontdekkingen hebben een naam en een puntenwaarde, maar leveren geen specifieke eigenschap op, wat enerzijds jammer is, maar anderzijds het vlotte spelen ten goede komt. Geen civ-builder dus, ook geen historische simulatie, maar wel een meerderhedenspel met een extra.

Compared to the other Civilization type of game (Clash of Cultures, Nations, Civilization, History of the World, etc), this game manages to do the following better:

1. Quick and Easy to learn Rules.
2. Faster gameplay.
3. More "RPG"ish feel as each turn players get to play the actual historical figures vs. just going through eras / epochs.

This game manages to provide fun, solid game play, luck, and history learning all at the same time.

12/14/10  Played Heroes of the World. I'm not sure what I think. I liked the hero cards and how they work, but too much luck and kingmaking bother me.

2/21/11  Heroes of the World is OK, I guess, but it just doesn't get my blood pumping. I can't put my finger on what bothers me, though.

RATING: 6.5
A rather simple game about area control. The game has very nice components, a good written rule and the gameplay is flawless.  However the game somehow does not click with me, mostly because it's a little bit too simple: In each turn you can basically do up to 3 different things :

1. Place soldiers in regions to gain the majority
2. Put a victory point token in a region to determine its value
3. Make one attack (which basically means to remove soldiers from the board).

Actually you can do a little more but nothing that siginificantly changes the way the game feels. So all in all you don't do much except for putting and removing soldiers to and from the board and occasionally score a region. A friend of mine yesterday stated: "This game is ok, there are no severe flaws but it feels a little bit like a Eurogame published in the early 90's"  Which means: The game works in a Euro style but lacks new and/or interesting concepts.  Therefore I only rate it 6.5/10.

Pure area control. Dull

The basic mechanics are really good... My only issue with the game is that it tends to create a kingmaker position whereby someone will realise "I can't win, but I can come second if I make X person win"
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Rating based on one partial play; game was stopped during the second age due to cumulative discovery of four to five major rule errors, due to poor and incorrect rules explanation.

Players draft cards that represent famous "heroes" of history. Each card gives the player: 1) units, 2) knowledge, 3) conflict points, and 4) gold. Units are necessary to secure the various areas on the board. Knowledge, represented as points, is slowly distributed onto the same areas,  with the cumulative point value going to the player with the most units in that area. Half points go to the second. The third player may get even less than half of that, to possibly zero points. Each conflict point allows the player to "attack" by rolling a die, which has a generally positive outcome 2/3rd of the time. Gold allows mass migration of units from one area to another, purchasing of "wonders" which give VP and have special one-time use powers, or simply purchasing VP at a 2:1 rate.

Heroes have largely asymmetrical values, depending somewhat on a historical context. For example, Marco Polo gives lots of gold, but not much else. George Washington gives lots of units, but not much else. King Charlemagne gives some units, coupled with a lot of conflict. There are few heroes with substantial knowledge, however. So, drafting and playing a particular hero becomes a tension-filled decision. You could add knowledge (VP) to a given area, but you must have enough units to get the majority, or someone else could come in and take it away. In this manner, the area control scoring is similar to Struggle of Empires or Age of Empires from Martin Wallace.

It is not a bad game. However, it does not have much of a civilization building feel, nor does it feel like a wargame. It may be a touch simplistic, but there is enough to ponder, plus the downtime is minimal. I'd be up for a correctly played game sometime soon. For now, it is a '7'.

A Civ "Light" game that is OK, but players need to be able to play quickly.  Otherwise, there isn't enough thought in it for the time it takes.  However, I tend to like either complicated, strategic games or shorter games with fun themes.

This was bad! Drafting with cards of widely different value, dice rolling for combat and randomly drawing tiles for points. For a game with so much luck, it should have been short and fun, but it was neither of both. The game has no new mechanics whatsoever, it would have been mediocre in the 80s, but today it's just no good at all.

This game has elements of several other popular games and when mixed together, the result is a pleasurable experience that doesn't require an entire evening. There is a bit of the following games found here: History of the World, El Grande, Web of Power and Ticket to Ride.  There are two distinct parts to the game. The Ancient Period is simply placement and dominance - rather static. The Modern Period is dynamic with troops flowing all about as (1) there are more troops available and (2) there is more money available (compared with the first era).

Sometimes the choices are obvious while often one has that familiar problem of wanting to do several things and not having the resources to do them. The rules are no more difficult than a Ticket to Ride game and the game should never last more than 90 minutes. I have never played in a game that anyone was zapped out of the competition early. I have seen the last place player (in the first era) win the game. My only gripe is that I wish there were additional eras; that the game lasted longer - and that is a good sign.

There is nothing new or original in this game (beyond, perhaps the Heroes themselves.)  It's light and short and uses little plastic figures to disguise the lack of depth.

And yet it was terrific fun - a game filled with what I call "anecdote moments".  This isn't a game in which serious gamers can plot a careful strategic plan, executing clever tactics.  No, this is a game in which Napoleon tries to conquer America and gets defeated straight after George Washington tries to do exactly the same thing...

Played once so far.  I like this pretty well.  It's a fast-moving civilization game, which is pretty rare.  The theme is mainly derived from the leader cards you play.  (There are also wonders, which will be used once or twice per wonder).  There are discoveries but all they do is make a region worth +X points.  So it's pretty abstract but there were some pretty thematic incidents in our game.  For example George Washington taking control of the Americas, or Jesus (yes, there is a Jesus card; also Buddha and Mohammad I think) discovering Theology.  I think the most unthematic aspect is that there are only two epochs, so for example Tenochtitlan and Versailles are both modern era Wonders.

Area Malojity / Civ Spritzer. Lovely presentation and great gateway- a briefer 'brief history of the world'?

This is a good game for play with older children or a end of evening 'brain relaxer'.

RATING: 6.5
After 2 plays (2 & 5 player) Game feels flat with no real mounting tension.  I like the use of historical figures, but it needs something I can't put my finger on.  

A weak area control game with poor combat implementation.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Dudes-on-a-map area majority conflict that plays out a bit like a stock-holding game: cards representing famous historical figures provide some combination of dudes (area majority/shares), knowledge (which increases the value of a region and triggers its scoring once a certain number are played), money (buy wonders or pay to move dudes around) and attacks.

I call it a stock market game because, with the conflict removed, simply placing the dudes on the map feels very much like the same kind of constructive collusion and incentive management I enjoy in games about trains: do I acquire a minority stake here, if I pump up the value of the region here will that encourage players to go there etc.

In practice, players don't really have enough control to worry about that -- anything remotely interesting about the game is thrown out the window by the high level of randomness. Attack results are especially pernicious: an attack of strength X can arbitrarily result in anything from destroying X+1 enemies to stealing X gold to losing X attackers.

File under "promising but underdeveloped".

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It's a light game. Maybe people get confused by the word "strategical". It's not. It's tactic, and luck.
But there is nothing wrong in being a short civilization game with tactic and dice.
And the leaders are well balanced, after a more deep look (they may seem unbalanced during the first game, but try a few games and you'll see the possibility), the wonders are much less balanced and this is why the game doesn't goes over 7/10.

If you are an Eurogamer, do not even try this game. But don't try it and give it a rating of 4 only because you don't like cards or dice, it's just not the game for you, that's it.

RATING: 7.5
When the game was explained to me, It sounded like there would be extreme balance and luck problems.  Moreover, the "we saved on graphics by using public domain stuff" was at odds with the molded plastic pieces, which didn't bode well either.
 
However, when I actually played it, it was WAY better than I expected.  The cards are more decently balanced than I thought at first glance, it's easy to hedge your bets against the "luck" elements, or to avoid them if you don't want to fight,  and though it LOOKS like there is kingmaking at the end,  generally the reality is that players can only go in one of a couple of places by the point where it would give that impression, so they're just making do with what's available (so what really mattered was whether you put yourself in a position where someone might be best served tearing down someone for some 2nd place points for themselves).

Definitely one of those games where people might let their pre-judgements mess up their perception of how it actually plays out.

You have less/no influence as soon as your turn is over. There happens to much between your own turns. This means you can't make a good tactic decision.

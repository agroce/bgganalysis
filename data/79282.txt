We played this at the demo booth under the guidance of the game developer. It was an okay game, but I must say the theme and gameplay didn't do much for me. I didn't buy it.

RATING: 8
Tight economy, clever combination of known mechanisms, but it doesn't tip over the edge to put onto a wantlist. I enjoy playing and certainly would love to play if someone wanted to bring it out. Very nice but I project that it would quickly dip to a lower rating with a few plays (maybe). Actually, wondering about it makes me wish it would stick around a little more.

Oh dear, Era of Inventions fails miserably in one area. The graphic design of the board and the components is not self-explanatory at all, and assessing the situation requires constant references to the rulebook. This makes the game hard to access and a real pain to explain/learn. The idea is great though, you produce basic resources to refine them into advanced resources in order to make inventions for only some other player to claim the patent for it. Thematically this makes sense but it seems it has been a bit challenging to make the abstraction into a boardgame format in an elegant way. After all, the game has more of a family euro resource management feel to it instead of a heavy economic game while the mechanics suit a heavier game better. What strikes me as a big negative as well is that the inventions do not change the course of the game by creating the any kind of narrative. The whole game is just bland repetition of the same from the very start until the bitter end. Avoid.

Comment after only one game (played with a misinterpreted rule), so take with a grain of salt:
The theme intrigued me, the worker placement is one of my favorite mechanics, but somehow Era of Inventions fell flat to me. It is not enough good or different to emerge among other titles.
The game is a pretty standard worker placement game, with a very limited number of spots available (why didn't the author introduce a variable number of worker places, in the same way as Vasco Da Gama?).
Furthermore, it seems to have some problems both at production level (components colors are awfully similar, and I am NOT color blind) and at play level (first player seems to have a huge advantage, there's no mechanism à la Caylus for changing turn order).
I'd like to retry it to form a more consolidated opinion.

Seemed to have the ingredients for a good game but for a reason which is not exactly clear to me, the game just wasn't fun. Maybe it is too complex for what it is . When you struggle through the rules a very good game has to appear worth the struggling.

Era of Inventions is your typical cube-pushing eurogame: you place resources, you get resources, you manage resources. Yet, as pasted on as it feels, I still like its theme, which leads me to turn a blind eye on how boring it actually is. [i](October 2011)[/i]

[b]Update[/b] - One of the goals I set for my Fall 2015 rating revise was to limit half-point ratings to a handful of games: Era of Inventions isn’t one of those by far, so I rounded down my rating from 6,5 to 6.

No theme at all. The resources don't work. It's impossible to play with the extra action tokens as it is impossible to have any kind of strategy.

It's an ok game, but game play is too flat and repetitive. There are several eurogames with similar but better gameplay so it remains as an average game with few possibilities to be among the great ones.

First impression is of an appealing theme let down by the execution and fuzzy graphic design leading to too long a game for what it is - though possibly impressions would be more positive with further plays. There are the bones of a decent game here - collect resources and use them to generate more by building factories and inventions - but there's a lot of shuffling of resources and the game felt a bit too tight at times and the overly chunky end-game scoring - boom or bust on the bonus scores seems make or break was unsatisfying.

This game has an uncommon subject, and the author has attempted to carry over some of its peculiarities into the game. It is then somewhat unfortunate that the game itself is fairly bland and turns out to be a rather standard resource conversion engine with a few touches of growth mixed in (which allow you to obtain resources at a somewhat greater rate). It all seems to mesh together well, though. That said, the game feels a bit too processional, and at higher player numbers the players are forced to do things which may not align with their own interests simply because all the useful actions have been taken by the others, forcing them to use their emergency action sooner than they thought they should. It was fun to have tried, but I haven't seen nor played the game since. It seems to have fallen off the radar of most gamers out there, and I'm not sure I disagree with that fate.

RATING: 1
Rating is based on the gameplay. It is suffering from severe lack of development and playtesting. It appears rushed. After playing it once I could see immediately two or three things that were glaringly wrong with the game and was screaming out for. There was only 1 winning strategy. No challenge to the game after one play.

Will never play it again. I would rather be locked into one of Jigsaws traps than play this again. Seat placement at the start of the game in relation to the start player is critical. If you are the start player, buy all the wood, you will win! The player in the 2nd seat will be 2nd, 3rd player will be 3rd.... I'm sure you see a pattern here!

Myself plus two of the other 5, including the person who won, said it was an awful game and would never play it again. I feel bad for the guy who bought the game, that was 30 euros wasted!

Worst game I have played for years.

RATING: 7.5
Első játékra 2 kisebb hibát vétettünk, ami pedig benne volt a szabályban. :-( /És igazából mindkettő lehet játék befolyásoló/
A játék:
Kinézet. Szép, bár kissé sötétebb színek, többnyire jól olvasható jelek - ez alól egy kivétel: a cserepiac utolsó mezőjének jelei. AMúgy minden fontos infot tartalmaz, mondjuk még rá tehettek volna pár jelet /pl, h cserepiacon 5 csere, s max 3 egy mezőn/, azaz a korlátokat vhogy jelölhették volna, de ez nyilván csak az első 1-2 játéknál okoz legfeljebb problémát.
A szabályok nagyjából világosak, jól összeszedettek - bár van félreértési lehetőség, pl. az erőforrások vásárlásánál, h mennyit is lehet venni. 
A játék maga: sok opciós, és tervezős munkás lerakós játék, sok úttal, lehetőséggel. 5 főnél kicsit hosszú volt, de ez egyrészt azért is volt mert első játék, másrészt mert én néha kiestem, mivel a szabályfüzetet bújtam :-)
Ugyanakkor figyelmet igényel a játék: nekem sikerült az utolsó 2 körre kiütni magam, egy hibás lépés miatt -amiben én voltam a hibás, félrenéztem vmit. De emiatt 2 körig semmi érdemlegeset nem tudtam tenni, s a többiek akkor azért szereztek 8-10 pontokat: simán állva hagytak.
(Ha ott nem nézem el, akkor a játék végén nekem plusz 8 pont, másoknak meg csökkenés, egész más lett volna a vége.)
Tehát nem árt figyelni. Ugyanakkor úgy érezheti az ember, h kiszorítósdi lesz a játék, de igazából ezeket többnyire ki lehet védeni, felkészüléssel, plusz akcióval, alternatív tervvel.
Szerintem nem rossz játék, sőt egész kellemes. Sok újdonság a tapasztalt rókáknak nincs benne, de jól van összerakva, működik a dolog, kellemes.
Megvenni nem fogom, de ez csak annak köszönhető, h van már nem kevés játékom. Ha csak 10 lenne, elgondolkodnék rajta.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
(Rating based on 15+ asynch online plays on Yucata.de [microbadge=19345])

Rarely used theme. Should have been more streamlined though. A few ad-hoc rules keep it from getting a better score. They may be interesting in an abstract way, but they make no sense thematically and just complicate the game unnecessarily.

For instance, you place the workers in player order. When all workers have been placed, you remove them again in player order to use actions. This just drags the game out in my opinion. Plus, you have three discs that provide bonus actions. They can be used after the regular action has been taken. What sounds cool in theory can make the game rather frustrating. Because you may place a worker and end up getting [i]nothing[/i] for it because the guy who was first in play order and who didn't even place a meeple there snatched it right from under your nose. Tons of fun...

What I dislike the most thematically is that there are bonus resources on the score track, so if you land on it, you get them. However, influencing how many points you can make is heavily restricted, so it becomes pretty random.

Playing this game made me miserable.  Not many games do that.  In a worker placement game, if you find yourself saying "oh,no, I have to place another worker," and you only have two workers, it's a bad sign.

2011

Players: 3-5
Duration: 90 mins
Type: Worker placement

I thought the board a visual delight--probably the best part of the game for me since it is pretty much the standard Euro, worker placement game.  It is a tight game, meaning not much room for mistakes.  It is easy to block others out of important actions yet there is no compensation for turn order, which rotates to the left.  I felt the number of cubes was skimpy, and two colors so close together is unfortunate.  The bonus action marker is a nice twist and very cut throat.

Tentative rating on a home version, 3-player.

Spreadsheety min-maxers are gonna love this one. Unlike Vasco da Gama, where the main obstacle is the other players, in EoI, your main struggle is with the game's cube->VP system. Still, opportunity for deliberate nastiness does exist, so perhaps my rating will rise with more plays. Sure hate that last turn min-maxing, though.

Almost put off by the garish board and 'yet another' worker placement.  But the inventive (heh) use of the invention cards provides a lovely little engine that drives this into the will-play-again category. They really needed to have sorted out their component colours, more info on the board or player cards, but otherwise good.

I've been playing this on yucata and it seems pretty good. I find the theme fascinating and the mechanics are great - worker placement with lots of options, including using the inventions of others.

Interesting game with a good theme, but it takes far too long with 5 players and I doubt it should be played with more than 4.My rating is hesitantly high and mostly because I see a good potential in the game and it might be decreased after a second play.

The colours are a catastrophe even for non-colour blind person. Why is the dark purple nearly the same colour as the black bonus tokens? Why are the gold tokens more or less the same as the yellow action tokens? Many mistakes were made due to this.

Here we have an OK game with interesting ideas. Sadly the game is not as interesting as it may seem at first glance. To us it seemed that there's no way around the factorys, aswell as the resources. Problem is, that there are only 2 spaces available each turn to get the resources. While there are options to get around this (or just do something different), none is as strong, since you need the resources for... well, everything.

Another dull worker placement deal. I'm getting pretty sick of these, and this one is kind of irritating. It has a lot of stuff that didn't seem to add much, like all the business with patents and knock-off items. All of that seemed to constrain player choice, rather than add interest. Meanwhile there is not enough incentive to produce inventions when your opponents benefit so much. By the end I just didn't care what happened very much, and that feeling remains.

Another of Ceedee's new games. We got the rules wrong for the first 6 turns (out of 10). Almost all the actions seemed to exchange one resource for another at a ratio of 1:1 or worse. In the last 4 turns things were easier but it was too late to appreciate the game properly.

Serious development issues that's an understatement.  This game doesn't work almost at all.  There are serious problems with investment/gain ratios and you can do very very little in the game, because you get just few too few resources throughout it.

For me it looks like promising prototype - well invented, but in need of intensive testing and adjusting existing ratios/parameters.  But I'm not going to do that.  When I buy/play a game I expect a finished product, not a semi-product..

EDIT:  Turns out that we played with 1 crucial rule wrong..  So I checked the rulebook - the said rule (buying on market) is written in an OUTRAGEOUS way.  Rating '3' stays firmly for this mindlessness of the publisher...

Era of Inventions has several innovative elements, the most pronounced being the invention/patent mechanic.  Despite this it gives the feel of a game where players late in the turn order don't have a whole lot of control over which strategy to follow.  The goods production is a simple resource conversion; I wish it were more interesting but it just isn't to me.

I'd still like to play 1-2 more times but the game will not make my buy list.

There seem to be 3 major strategies:
- industry
- inventions
- 50/50

All work fine. However, I doubt that I'll play this game often because you can't do much within these alternatives. The turns are quite similar and you always have only 1-2 choices of what to do in your turn.

There seem to be a lot of ways to go - build factories and
then run them for goods, create early inventions and get
bonus when people build them, trading at the market.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Tentative rating pending a play with three instead of four. 

Era of Inventions has the spark of an idea at its core. Players invent things but then other players can actually produce and manufacture these things, and then both players get some kind of benefit. It's possible to produce knock-offs occasionally for pure self-gain, but that can be blocked with patents. 

Everything surrounding that idea seems starkly underdeveloped. Graphic design is awful. Actions are often subject to all kinds of arbitrary (though non-complex) limitations but of course non of that is on a player aid anywhere. Basically the game is total amateur-hour stuff.  

As for the inventions themselves, tier one seems bad enough to skip altogether. The real issue is that the different inventions don't feel different at all. In fact phonographs, cameras, and sewing machines are identical from a gameplay point of view. It's deadening. 

There's a spark here but it's really hard to believe this game made it through the publication process. It is *rough*. It's also highly unlikely that it should be played with more than three players. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Only online play at Yucata.de. If it wasn't for the online implementation, I never would have played it. I expected worse but with three players it's ok. With four players there's not enough possibilities to build up anything with only two workers per round and placement spots so scarce that the fourth player usually has to waste his last worker. Era of Inventions is another proof that Quined Games lacks the competency to develop a game to the end. Something, I already felt when they still cooperated as QWG and which is true to a lesser degree for their former partner White Goblin as well. In sum, it's something which is interesting to get to know but there are too much better worker placement games to warrant a purchase.

[comment after 2 plays]

There are a lot of production issues in the game: colors are too similar and bland, fonts are too small.

However, the game play was surprisingly good. Much better than I remembered from the BGG.CON experience. I think the key difference is the bonus action tokens. They really transformed the game into a tension filled affair where people can snipe the target of your next actions with the bonus actions. The big difference is that playing with 4 players everybody gets 5 bonus actions tokens as opposed to 1 in a 5 player game (I believe the BGG.CON play was with 5 players).

Download and use the rewritten rules here on BGG to teach yourself/learn the game - don't even bother using the traniwreck of a rulebook that comes with the game.

A fair game. Not great, but not terrible. 

A second play w/5 player changed the dynamics / the way the game played out (my first play was 3 player), but has just re-affirmed my rating - it just exchanged one set of issues with another. Being the last player in a 5 player game really blows. Players 4-5 need to be compensated with additional resources/cards or something to offset being locked out of the limited amount of things you can do in the first few turns. I still believe that resources are way too limited and difficult to acquire to be able to do all things in a single game.

The illustration/graphic/colors design of the board/cards/pieces leaves a LOT to be desired / fixed had caused every single player in both the 3 and 5 games difficulty at least once (multiple times for a couple of us), and required backups/redos because of mistakes several times.
I would almost prefer playing this out on a chart vs a board. This game cannot possibly have been tested/played with the final pieces/colors before production.

I feel with some tweaking this mediocre game could been a good game. The concept and the elements are there, the right procedure and balance just needs to be found to make a good soup.

Here we have another tight-knit worker placement game. Lots of different resources that can be used to buy cards (that provide resources), technologies (which provide points or gold), cogs (which patent technologies, so when people purchase them you get a small share of points or gold), etc. The scoring track allows you to gain resources when you [b]land[/b] on certain squares, tricky to manage but an interesting, and perhaps not trivial, quirk.

Seems to be a good design. Everybody starts with very little and you really need to work hard to gain more than others as the game progresses. It's really easy to be boxed out of something you want especially since players can use black discs to purchase additional items (ones you may have been relying on) on their turn as additional actions.

The game though feels tiring and dull to me. I really can't place why -- maybe it's the theme. Maybe it's just being overindulged in these worker placement / cube conversion games.

Although playable, Era of Inventions takes what was really an exciting time in history and reduces it to what for me is an unexciting process with no real feel for the theme. Euro Game fans will like it in that it is familiar territory mechanically and if you like games where you vie for the optimum strategy of combining just the right actions, with some interaction with other players, then you should give this game a go. But I don't expect much trash talking or laughter takes place. The design is solid mechanically but ultimately it left me with a "so what?" feeling. I think that its a lost opportunity to develop a stronger theme. Overall. Not a bad game but nothing to get you excited either. Certainly nothing here to set it apart from other Euros.

Yet another Essen 2010 game with serious underdevelopment issues.

The underlying idea of earning points and money when others build your inventions is interesting but the actual game has serious flaws and the rulebook is full of ambiguities.

The biggest issue here is that the static turn order favors the first players immensely, and there is no compensation for the players later in the turn order. There's also a serious rich-get-richer problem.

Mi ha deluso molto, solo 1 partita all'attivo ma perché dovrei rigiocarlo? Gioco di gestione risorse (che si possono guadagnare o fabbricare) e con queste si possono creare delle invenzioni, ogni invenzione verrà commercializzata e questo significa guadagni (punti o soldi) per aver brevettato il prodotto (l'idea è molto carina e anche l'ambientazione). Il grosso difetto è che il gioco è squilibrato a seconda della posizione di partenza (molto vantaggioso essere il primo e pessimo essere l'ultimo), inoltre avendo 12 'azioni' e 10 dischi da piazzare troppo spesso l'azione 'rimasta' non è praticabile/utile e quindi si passano turni interni (e stiamo parlando di partite che durano dai 6 agli 10 turni) inattivi. Trovo quindi il gioco ingiocabile in 5 e probabilmente gira meglio in 3, piuttosto consiglio il simile Leonardo Da Vinci (piazzamento-gestione risorse-invenzioni) o I Pilastri della Terra. Per la sua claustrofobia nelle scelte ricorda anche Vasco da Gama che però ha una struttura molto più collaudata e giustamente si ferma a 4 giocatori.

At first, after reading the manual, I was somehow convinced it was to complex.

I really tried to like the game because of the theme, but I could not. Even in a three player game you do not get what you intended to choose - in case that you have a choice. Being the last player in the turn is a big disadvantage which is only increased by the black tokens. Some of the mechanics are interesting, but not very well developped. A good idea has been wasted in my eyes .

Agonising decision making game where you always feel there is more you could be doing or doing it better!
Choose limited space actions (two per action space) & then resolve (one action each in turn order). Easy enough until the player who shares the action space with you takes the resources or builds the invention that you wanted; so which to resolve first!

A very nice and solid worker placement game.
At first it may not appear any different then other games of this genre, but there are some very nice twists that are new. At least to me.The bonusaction is a very tricky thing. The relation between the inventions, the production of them and the patents is very well worked out in this theme.
The artwork is very nice, though to my opinion a bit on the dark side.

This game fell totally flat for me and the group we played with. The actions weren't varied enough to make interesting decisions. The extra actions being used early in the game made starting as the last player incredibly frustrating. There were many action limits and end game points that could have been written on the board for ease of game play. Basically, there were a ton of improvements that could have been made, but nothing great to make me want to play again.

Wood, wood, wood. It's all about the wood. Then there's the wood. With the opening so constrained it's a little dull to start off with, but it does get a little better if you hang in there. Still, it's very dull. You certainly need wood to build factories to make more wood to make more factories to make other cubes and cogs that make victory points. Around about a third of the way through the options open up a bit because you'll have developed your money and wood supply, which will get you your cogs, and you'll get into patents and stuff the game is trying to be about. But by then you might just have lost interest - especially if you were the fourth starting player. It's a shame really because the artwork is nice and the theme and concept are perfectly workable. It's just that the whole invention economy is so dependent at the start upon one resource that you're pushed down a path with very little wiggle room (mostly in the form of a little black wooden disc), to deviate from that oh so wooden path. I dunno - maybe it's just me. In any case, it's very dull.

I really want to like this game.  I like the theme. I like the idea of sharing interest in inventions.  I love rushing the fakes out and countering with patents.  But, it is just super wonky with three players and is downright unpleasant with five.  The first person turn order advantage is demoralizing.  And if you have the last seat you really don't have much to do that is interesting other than watch everyone build their engine up while you make inefficient turns just to block people.  Yuck.

It should also be noted that the rules are a complete mess.

Still, there really is so much to like here that when it does work it is quite enjoyable.  I just can't help but feel that this game needed another few rounds of playtesting to help it rise above its problems.

Played on Yucata only.

A quick worker-placement/action-selection game. You earn VP by discovering inventions (spending cogs), which brings those inventions into the game (including some "fakes", which have the same art but a different cube cost). People can build the inventions for rewards (VP or gold); when others build your invention, you earn VP or gold (but for the fakes, you only get rewards if you've patented the invention). 

It's an economic game of managing to build and convert various resources into VP. With 4 players, though, your options seem very limited (just 2 workers)! The extra bonus action tokens, though, do help with that -- although they also make planning a bit more difficult than in most worker-placement games (since other players can take what you want on their turn). Also somewhat unusually, the inventions that come up do so in random order ... so you're a bit at the mercy of the shuffle.

Overall, not a bad game; but certainly not great!

It's all driven by workers, of which you have only TWO (3 in a 3er game). They may be placed in one of several areas, each of which accommodates only 2 workers: 
- run factories, which produce what's shown at the top of the card; cubes, gold, or cogs; start with just 1 factory each (produces brown cube)
- build factories: up to 3 of the 5 on display; costs some combination of black and brown cubes
- buy resources: up to 3 lots of cubes (black, brown, gray, blue, white); these are placed on the board at the start of each round (adding to any remaining from previous round)
- produce inventions: spend cubes to produce up to 3 inventions, earning gold or VP
- develop inventions XOR register patents:
... developing (costs cogs) gives you an immediate reward (income; VP for "improved" inventions)
... registering patents (costs gold) allows you to earn bonus even when a "fake" is produced; also, you advance up the patent track
- exchange market: conduct up to 5 exchanges (no more than 3 per box on the board) of cogs/gold/cubes into cogs/gold/cubes/VP/bonus-action-markers

Each round (8 in 4er, 9 in 3er), players in turn order (rotates from round to round) first place all their workers, one by one. Then, they activate any of their workers one by one; after each action, may spend a bonus token to take another action (same as normal actions, but weaker -- e.g., buy a single factory). At the end of the game, earn bonus VP for player with most patents; with most productive factories; with most cogs spent on inventions. 

Most VP wins.

Very mediocre worker placement game. What game makes you conclude you have too many actions available and no interesting spots to pick for your workers?

RATING: 5
[Quined Games 2010 Master Print edition] {Industry age; work-placement, resource management; optimal 4p} Era of Inventions is a solid Euro game.  There are no novel mechanics.  Player interaction is good.  It's easy to learn and teach the rules.

The game looks multi-faceted; however, it's so clear that inventions are much more important than other ways -> factories / producing inventions.  It's quite easy that one can win a game handily if he/she produces more inventions than other players.  So, strategic variance of each game is very limited.   Thus, I don't think this game has a staying potential.

I do agree that the last player in sitting order is in lower hand without compensation, in the out-of-the-box rules.  There are several workarounds:
1. The designer's variant can be used.
2. More resources or 1 development Cog can be given to the last players at set-up.
3. The last player has 1/2 more bonus action discs at set-up.

After reading the rules and BGG comments, I am interested to know whether this game is really good for 5p.  After I have tried the game, it seems that 5p game is not good at all.

At first, I hope for a strong theme. However, this game is only about moving cubes around without involving a theme.  (Let me get 3 white and 1 purple cubes to do sth, etc. => versus let me get tools and technology etc.)  In short, the theme is real weak.

The production quality is ok.  The choice of color may have problem that purple and black / wood and white are too similar.  The illustration on the board is quite pedestrian.  Player aids can be given to remind users about the details of each action space and the bonus discs.

Era of inventions is played over 8, 9 or 10 rounds –depending on the number of players–. In each round players attempt, by using action tokens, to use the following actions at the wisest, such as: building factories, buying or producing goods, and making and producing new inventions. The number of action tokens is limited however(the time is short), and thus you must choose the best of many actions, given your situation. The player who uses his actions, money, goods and development points at the best will earn the most influence in the Era of Inventions and win the game!

Unbalanced game mechanics. Wood is the most important resource in the game but can only be acquired at the market. The first action of the first player is to buy all the wood, so in the first round he's the only one who can do anything useful giving him a huge advantage for the rest of the game.

Worker placement game that's extremely tight, as experienced with 4 and 5 players. You only get a couple of workers to place on the board, and there are only twelve total spots to place (in six different areas), and you can't be in the same area twice. Buy cubes in one area, spend cubes on factories or inventions, convert cubes and money in the market in various ways, or build and patent new inventions. 

As a group we felt like the game needed a tiny bit of tweaking to be better. For example, when you create an invention, the entire invention deck gets fully reshuffled and dealt again. This can mean that the very same inventions from last turn end up on the board again, while yours waits in the draw pile. And if someone builds again, they get reshuffled yet again, so the same thing can happen turn after turn if you're unlucky. It seemed like there needed to be a way that older inventions would get a guaranteed shot at the board by not reshuffling the deck. Other than the beautiful artwork, my favourite part of the game are the extra action disks, which if you're clever can be used on your turn to jump ahead in the turn order, and get a vital resource or card that someone else is planning on.

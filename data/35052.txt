Good update to axis and allies but i felt the board especially left a lot to be desired, not to speak of tech (modified my version). I think this is a solid update to one of the absolute top board games of all time.

RATING: 9
Awesome version of the game.  The addition of Italy as a separate power is a dramatic change in the turn structure, and it is really fun to see them play "spoiler" by clogging naval lanes, stealing the middle east, etc.  Nice production quality, the huge board is great and the national objectives are a very cool addition to the game.

While I have never had a problem with the Axis & Allies presentation, over time I have grown to dislike it's combat system, the god-awful Research rules, and it's poor balance issues.
Pacific 1940 would rank as one of the worst games I ever played.

This anniversary edition provides the fullest, richest Axis and Allies experience. The board is massive and beautiful.  If you like the game you will love this - too bad it is so hard to come by.  10 stars in my book for the ridiculously fun games I've had playing this with my best friends.  I will never turn a game down, even if it takes three days!

Didn't notice much difference between this and the Revised Edition except for some upgraded components.  Those comments still stand : way too long for what it is and usually decided by who rolls better.

RATING: 5
Nicer looking, but doesn't play as a well as Revised.  Japan is pretty much irrelevant, at least in the '41 scenario (which I am told is the more fun of the two...).  The whole game depends on what happens in Europe, which, while historically accurate, doesn't make for a good game.

RATING: 6.5
A grand strategy game set in World War II, Axis and Allies combines the necessity of team work, tactical thought and strategic vision in order to win the war. It's a little too chance based, and it has been analyzed pretty thoroughly, but otherwise it can be an engrossing experience.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Very 'dicey' easy to play game. Has all the new units and additional nation flavor rules of the other sets.  Adds Italy as a nation; however, would recommend this nation for a noob as it is boring to play for an experienced player.  The map changes and new rules for China are an excellent addition.  Caution: game length can be very long.  The components are excellent.  This is a must for die-hard A&A fans!

Having been the developer of Larry Harris's brilliant design, I love Axis and Allies. My contribution was the initial work on the combat system in cooberation with Larry. I did a lot to balane the original design. The Nova version was good for its time, but development by Milton Bradley and Hasbro with Larry's supervision made this game one of the best selling wargames ever.

RATING: 9
Nice game, I like the national objectives.  This is the first game of A&A I've ever played.  How I managed to miss this for the last 20 years I don't know.  There are a few subtle rule differences from previous editions that take some playing and referring to, in order to get down pat.

The six player game at first seems to be a short straw for the Italians, but if they can eliminate the British forces in Egypt, then Africa and Western Asia lay open to them.  My gaming group feels that the game is much more balanced than older editions.  One gamer who has the Revised (2nd edition) is considering trading it away as he can't see playing it again when we have this copy in the group.  The larger board with more finely divided geographical areas makes for a longer game.

Though a magnificently overproduced game I do take issues with some of the design choices and would have been much happier with a smaller box.  This could have been done by allowing the maps to be folded in half.  The box ships with a corrugated cardboard insert to keep the box top from dishing.  Once this and the counter sheets are removed, the box lid is going to be very susceptible to dishing and creasing.   The smaller boxes inside allowing each countries pieces to be separated was a nice idea.  

The historically accurate ship designs for the carriers, battleships, planes and tanks is appreciated, and the Panther tanks and Yamato class battleships are wonderful.  However the color choices were poor.   Italy and Russia are too similar in color, leading to confusion in low light situations.  I've also had a color blind friend complain about the colors.  With each country having unique designs you need to pay particular attention to the ships as it is easy to confuse the battleships with the cruisers, and the cruisers with the destroyers.  With a box this size it's surprising that there weren't more control markers; with the Japanese player running amok, he ran out, and we made do by moving some from uncontested areas of the board.  We also regularly ran short of dice, when there are stacks of 12 or 14 Russian infantry, you're going to end up grabbing every die in sight.  Hmm, maybe I need to pimp my set with the custom dice.

A FAQ is located here: http://www.harrisgamedesign.com/pdf/Anniversary_FAQ.pdf

6/13/09 - Raised my rating to a 9.  With the larger map there seems to be a lot of emphasis on maneuvering with combined forces, something which is hard to find in other light wargames.

At one time, I was a huge [i]Axis & Allies[/i] fan. I played it quite a bit. I still owned my MB A&A set.  When I saw A&A50 in my local game store, I bought it. I thought it was expensive at $150+. As it turns out, it may have been a sound investment.

The game improves many different aspects of the original A&A.  

The navy is stronger and cheaper, but transports are much more vulnerable to attack, and notably, building a huge merchant fleet to absorb loses is no longer possible.  The technology tree is expanded and there is a new mechanism for research which will always result in discovering a new technology which I think is a vast improvement over the last system.  And they have introduced new units for the navy and land forces, and added major cities which are used to determine victory. 

For me though, the biggest changes are in the map itself.  The map is much bigger than the MB A&A that I played before, with many more territories.  And there are a couple of areas that are completely off limits to land and air units.  I think they are an unnecessary complication to the map.  (I find it annoying that you can't even fly over the Sahara Desert.)  Also, they removed the rules to allow neutral territories to be occupied and used.  Granted, in the vast majority of games that doesn't matter because it is almost always bad to occupy a neutral territory, but it was still fun to have the option.  And even though the map is much larger, the units themselves still have the same range as before.  It takes much longer to traverse the map, and is much less forgiving when you do.  If you lose a major battle, you will never have time to move and reinforce your weakened areas.

All in all, I love the new rules and unit types. But I am not a big fan of the map itself. I'm thinking of trying to use the new rules with the original MB game.

RATING: 7.5
I got to play Italy and had a blast!  The addition of the sixth player and the bigger map makes this game longer but more fun.  Second game was Germany, so much fun! The old traditional strategies don't work as well as they used to (massive infantry stacks, Britain invade France every turn) - time to come up with new ones!  After the third play (as Britain) I'm wondering if the game is slanted towards the Axis?

UPDATE:  Played again, and was exposed to the variety in short-term strategy and tactics this version offers.  I wonder if this game could be any better for what it is trying to accomplish.  The new unit mix is good, the new map makes this game INCREDIBLE.  If you like Axis & Allies, you should be playing this version.  Period.

Easily the best version of Axis and Allies ever created.  Can't wait to play again, even though it is LONG.

UPDATE II:  I raised the rating to a "9."  If I am in the mood for this type of game, this is the one I want to play.

UPDATE III:  Half dozen plays in, I don't think that --- given enough time --- I would turn down playing this.  I just love it.  The only way this gets knocked down is if the combined Europe 1940 and Pacific 1940 makes THAT game the ultimate in Axis & Allies play.

not sure how i feel about this game to be honest.  I loved the original as a kid, but i have grown out of it over time.  It is definitely a game that looks neat and is fun for awhile, but it still feels clunky and too slow for a light wargame.  A couple design issues are apparent after awhile: Russia and Italian pieces are hard to differentiate and overcrowding of units in key areas gets real messy.  It is better than the original, and all the plastic components are cool to play with so I gave it a decent rating.

Great game, and in some ways I like this better than the 1981 edition, but my nostalgia for the 1981 edition is very high, meaning my enjoyment of both games is roughly equal.  Neither version is as quite as good as the 2004 edition, in my opinion.

$100 MSRP is a bit steep.  And I'm not sure how well the third Axis power of Italy is integrated into the game.  I'll definitely think about it, as the original A&A was such a fun part of my gaming youth.

[b]Update[/b]: Well, the wife decided against getting it for my birthday -- and since I'm "banned" from buying games before a birthday/holiday, the window of opportunity passed me by.  No way I'm paying the exorbitant prices it's fetching now that it's (likely permanently) out of print.  Oh well.

An excellent A&A game, now strugles to find a real place. A lot more complicated and time consuming than the simple A&A and lacks some elements of the A&A Global if you want to play a deeper and lengthy game.

Picked it up because it looked so pretty!

I love the rules changes (I havn't played any others in the series besides the 1981 Axis and Allies one).

I have only played 1 game so far, the 1941 set up, and I just love love love love that the game promotes having more units. After huge clashes in the pacific, both Japan and the US had navy to spare. It makes it feel more like a war, and less like an empty board.

AA50 is a very good game. In some ways it is superior to its predecessors: the map is bigger; in addition to 5 standard “big powers” there are two minipowers (Italy and China); it has two set-ups instead of one; it has more victory cities that are spread out in a way that enables more strategic choice; it has more unit types and more different models; income is higher and ships are cheaper (this makes luck in ship battles less important and allows for more interesting build ups).

Sadly, AA50 is not the peak of the series as it should be considering its price. For instance, unbalanced and nearly totally random technologies have been reintroduced;the map offers less choice in certain aspects (e.g. Manchuria is so obviously the best early factory site for Japan); the map looks pretty but is less functional than the map in the revised edition (it is difficult to see some of the land borders in Europe because of the color scheme and the number of units); it is difficult to distinguish ship types due to cruiser models. Inexplicably, there are still only 6 Japanese tanks and a lot of Soviet ships in the unit mix. Etc

The game also has the characteristic strengths and weaknesses of the earlier editions, such as excessive downtime between turns. I will not elaborate these - I assume that anyone interested in the limited anniversary edition is familiar with at least one of the standard editions.

To sum up, AA50 is the best incarnation of the game but not nearly as good as it should be considering the price tag and the extensive feedback given by fans on earlier editions.

11/21/08: Just picked my copy up from my FLGS. Big box, though a bit thinner than the older version. Map comes in three hard-mounted sections with no folds or creases, and lays very flat - nice. The map is the best A&A map I've ever seen, with beautifully detailed artwork presented in an understated manner. I do wonder though if it will still get crowded in Europe, since the map, while, bigger in size, also has something like an additional 20 land areas, so it's still rather tightly packed in Europe. China and Asian Russia got a lot of the new territories, and that will no doubt play a large role in changing the strategy of the Japanese player as regards the Soviet Union.

A couple of very minor annoyances with the components - it would have been nice had the research breakthrough tables and China-specific rules been provided on player aid cards, instead of buried in the rulebook. As it is, I scanned and copied each onto cardstock, so that players could refer to them during play without searching the rulebook for them.

Each nation (6 now, with Italy) comes with its own component storage box, plus two storage boxes for markers, dice, and chips, so no more need for ziplock baggies - also nice. The plastic pieces are, in general, very nice. Each nation's tanks are unique now, with British Matilda looking especially good. Cruisers are here now - again, the British one is an awesome three-stacker County class CA. The Soviets get the British ships, but their own tanks and planes. The Italians get German warships, and Japanese Betty bombers! The German/Italian cruisers are a little odd, very broad-beamed - I think these are modeled on the German Hipper class, but I'm not sure. The quality of the minis is fairly good, though the German/Italian battleships have annoyingly rough bottoms, such that they don't lay completely flat on the board (maybe I'll sand them down a bit). The colors of the minis do not exactly match the colors of the minis used in the older games, which isn't a big deal though it means you will see a difference if you decide to augment your forces in this game with pieces from your older version. 

The markers are nice, in that they are thicker than in some of the other recent A&A games (e.g. Guadalcanal, Battle of the Bulge), and have a fairly high quality subdued linen finish, as opposed to the slick and glossy finish on other recent A&A products, which is an upgrade in my book. The dice are new as well, with rounded edges, coming in black and red colors. The only issue I have with the dice and chips (gray and red) is that it would appear there might not be enough (though I say this without having played this version yet). I went ahead and augmented by game by adding some chips and dice from my A&A Revised set. 

The battle board and income chart again are on heavy, linen-finished cardboard, another upgrade from the thin, glossy pieces in A&A Revised. The nation cards are more of the same, and have set up info for both the 1941 and 1942 scenarios, as well as unit cost info and the national objectives. The nation cards also fit perfectly into the boxes that store the units and territory markers. 

I have my first play slated for tomorrow, so after that, I'll add comments. At this point, the rules look fine - basic move and shoot stuff remains unchanged, but some aspects regarding transports, subs, strategic bombing, research, and unit values have been changed, and all appears to the good, based on reading the rules. I am still a bit puzzled why convoy boxes were not employed, or some other means for submarine economic warfare included. The national objectives do not seem to capture this point either. However, the changes to sub movement and transport defense does mean that players will have to consider destroyers to escort those troop-laden transports, lest the subs wipe them off the map. 

Update (11/29/2008): After my first two plays, both of the 1941 scenario, my initial rating is 8. It may go up after more plays, as I don't think either game I played witnessed strong Axis play, so the seeming Allied advantage (they won both games) may not be a pronounced as it initially appears. 

Update (1/1/2009): Third play, an epic 8 round Axis victory in the 1941 scenario with 6 players, research, and national objectives. This game is awesome!

In my opinion, completely makes the base "Axis & Allies" completely obsolete.  Earlier start, adding the Chinese and Italians, more units, a better map and extra developments makes this one the king of the franchise.  Now all I need is a 1939 start, terrain, weather, hexes, leaders and a bit more chrome for perfection.

RATING: N/A
So we have yet another rehashing of the Axis & Allies brand, this time with a slightly larger board and a few more pieces along with a hefty price tag. What would have made this interesting would have been having the game starting in 1939 and including French, Italians and independent nations. Maybe hand painted pieces. Something that makes the game surprising. That would have made the game interesting, instead they have decided on a remake of a remake of a remake. It typfies the bankruptcy of this entire line of Avalon Hill games by Hasbro.

RATING: 6.2
A classic Amertrash game, enjoyable in its tactics and with amazing pieces and board presentation. However its  frustrating due to a very high luck element with fist-fulls of dice thrown. A bad run of luck in a crucial battle and it can be game over to all intents and purposes. There is a mind bending amount of planing required and to be remembered, (particularly as the US) which is needed to achieve objectives leading to frequent mistakes and wasted time and resources. It takes ages to play even with two players when the mind boggling planning is most apparent. With 5 players leave a whole weekend to play it to anywhere near conclusion. It is a game that drags particularly multiplayer with long dull periods of inactivity.

Probably the best A&A version thus far. There's been a clear attempt to clean up some of the gamey stuff that happens in A&A games and an overall effort to tip things more in favour of the Axis. Probably too much, though, as a weak China is still no match for a strengthened Japan. The China as a player variant evens things up a bit. Also prevents Japan from doing very gamey stuff like flying their planes to the Caucasus.

Downside - It's still A&A and at 7 players (with the China variant), downtime is totally ridiculous. Worse, while someone has to play China and Italy, they're not going to have much fun.

I have been playing this game since it came out.  This game hits the ground running; the rules and balance are just fine as is.  The models for each power are well done, the objectives system for bonus $$$ make sense historically and work well within the game.  The rules can be daunting for some, but are not nearly as cryptic as some hardcore war-games.  If you only want to have 1 Axis and Allies game, this is it.

One downside; the Russians and Italians are similar in color.  They can be tough to distinguish, especially if you are color blind.  Just sayin'.

RATING: 8
Although this edition has made a number of changes over the previous version, Axis and Allies remains a great fun game. It just has more bells and whistles, and isn’t that what we want from them? Major changes include the addition of an independent axis Italy (a 6th player), the ability of players to earn bonus credits for reaching national objectives, the widening of the Atlantic (so that there is less reason to abandon the Pacific) and in general, giving players more credits and lowering the costs of some units. However, while a great fun game has been improved, it still hasn’t reach perfection. In particular, the bomber's price has been cut so much that without house rules there is little reason to build anything besides them and infantry. Plus, the Italian armed forces have been turned into Mussolini’s dream force. Now, with just the slightest help from Germany, Italy can control the entire Mediterranean, large chunks of Africa and still send strike forces deep in Russia through Black Sea expeditions. In addition, China remains much too weak even though it has been given the ability to raise its own troops. After all, Japan did not conquer China historically, so why should that be a standard opening move in any World War II simulation? The situation is so strange that my group is considering a house rule that says Japan may only control those provinces of China that it actually garrisons. In any case, Axis and Allies is still the best light World War II strategic simulation available and this is its best edition.

Okay: Strategic - WW II - Easy

I was disappointed with the revised A&A. Eventhough the rule changes of the 2004 improved the game, I found the map and the cover revolting and I was not tempted to enough to play a lot of games. This one on the other hand does almost everything right and almost gives me the same thrill as the original and no game has managed that for a long, long time!

-Great components (despitesome color differences in the Italian and Japanese navy)
-Clean and comprhensive rules
-Great rule improvements
-Great FUN to play!

Yes it is still luckbased. 
 
Minus points:
-Static starting positions negatively influence the replay value over time.
-The Japanese fleet and the Italian fleet have slightly mixed colors, so no unisex. I wish they were all like the Germans which are by far the best qiality for some (or maybe obvious) reason ;-)
-Money is printed on one side only
-1941 Scenario too much in favor of the allies 

I find Axis & Allies Anniversary quite good value.

Bottom line,
For historic (realism)/ strategic depth stay away (I play EurFront series anytime as well) but if you want a long evening of fun with friends, than the A&A Anniversiray Edition is a decent game.

Two very issues: 
-The '41 scenario is indeed very difficult for the Axis but you can balance it easily out with a house rule.
-The luck factor is present and some carefully calculated offensives can disintegrate. The Axis are mostly prone to suffer most from one bad crucial attack; where the Allies can afford a mistake, the Axis can't. 

Got a good price and decided to sell.

Sold it.

It is too long, the downtime is considerable and it is very dice dependend.
I enjoyed my game anyway because it catches the theme well and it is interesting to see what the other players do while you are waiting plus: as long as both sides still have the chance of winning there is a lot of tension.
Would rate it higher if the above mentioned was not the case.

Essentially the same as the regular edition. Nicer pieces but the game play still takes forever and everything can swing on a couple of unlucky rolls. But you knew that going in.

Seems to fix some of the more annoying rules deficiencies of A&A without being overly complicated.

Too expensive.

Great addition to the series, well-worked rules, lots to engage players, will not be quick the first few times! My only complaints about the components are the shortage of grey counters and the spidery type on the cardstock - tricky for older gamers like me! 
Not sure about the national objectives though. They seem to favour the USA with an easy +5 IPCs for holding US and Canada ex Alaska. I would modify this to one bonus research token (not cumulative) each turn. America's production is already factored into the values.

A&A is NOT like Risk.  Risk is fundamentally a multiplayer negotiation game with a war theme.  The basic 'mechanism' in Risk is deal making and breaking - it has much more in common with Diplomacy than with A&A, which is a game between two sides with (obviously) no negotiation component at all.  The fact that both AA50 and Risk use dice for combat is entirely irrelevant.
I can't see how this is improved by added more players to the minimum of two.  Adding more players only adds downtime and gameplay length.  I know that its more realistic to have each country played by a different player, but each country should then have differing victory conditions - for example, once the Allies win then there is another method to determine which of the Allies won most.  THAT would be interesting but it would make it a game of deal-making more than military strategy and tactics and the importance of the subtle differences between units and positions would be greatly reduced.  So, I think its a two-player game and as such it is best.  Remember that this is at least a SIX hour game, and even then it will probably end through a resignation rather than by fulfilling the victory conditions - its a good game but the length is just a killer.

I missed out on this one as I was not staying on top of board game news when this came out.  When I did regain interest in the series, it had already become rare and too expensive.

Hopefully these versions will surpass the Anniversary edition.

RATING: 5
Like most wargames, this one suffers from the back-and-forth syndrome where the game falls into a stalemate because the game system is too balanced.

This, in turn, highlights how a series of lucky rolls can be the deciding factor in "breaking through", and really makes the 5 hours spent playing this game feel like a total waste.

The downtime is also horrendous as players have too many things to do and remember, rendering this game a non-playable one among my group of friends.

RATING: 8
There is a lot more money in this game, forcing the infantry push mechanic to be less of a problem. There are also more territories, which causes a push for a capital to stall the second the defense starts buying only defensive units.

It's another version of A&A, but I quite like it.
Way overproduced. The map with geographical features is a bad idea. It is beautiful but not so handy to play. Plastic miniatures are of supercheap quality and this is very bad for a 100$+ game. The boxes are superlative! Really handy and well made,
Starting units and their relative positions are completely ahistorical. Probably for game balance.
Rules are the same old A&A with some of the variants appeared on the web putted in. Another bad thing for a 100$+ game.
EDIT: (after more plays) using Egypt instead of Ottawa as objective and playing at 12 victory cities makes the game a lot better.

All dressed up and nowhere to go.  Bought it out of sentiment.  Will only play the "real" A&A with 2nd edition rules and bid system. Odd thing, though, this one is worth beau coup bucks on E-Bay, whereas the one I like (1984) to play is only worth scratch.  Oh well.

First Axis and Allies Anniversary Edition game session impression. 3 player game.

Played for 5 hours excluding one hour to set up and explain the rule. Played with some custom rules(Naval warfare single board fog of war and modified submarine combat). Was no where near finish.

Japan's momentum was very difficult to stop. I played as Allies. One of the tactic was to attack Italy's, Japan's and German's industrial centers with strategic bombing runs. Heck Even Russia built 2 bombers.

The British sank a German's heavy cruiser with a submarine using the custom rules(out of three submarines only one managed to find the German 3 Battleship and a cruiser strong fleet in the Baltic sea but it paid off by successfully sinking the cruiser).
The Germans have since learned the value of escorting destroyers to complement their big warship fleet.

Two destroyer strong Japanese surface action group failed to find a single British destroyer NW of Australia and soon after one went way west the British destroyer managed to find the now lone Japanese destroyer and engaged it in surface duel. The British destroyer then proceeded to sink the Japanese destroyer. :-).

In the last played battle US fleet supported by a bomber and 2 carrier based fighters engaged a force of single Japanese Battleship and cruiser SE of Japan's main island. The battle began with the three US submarine searching for the Japanese fleet, one of which successfully spotted them and proceeded to attack it but missed and dived deep. Meanwhile the US scouting carrier based planes managed to find the Japanese surface action group and proceeded to direct the bomber. However the bomber failed to hit any target and was eventually shot down but the carrier based planes damaged the battleship tilting it sideways and the US single Battleship and destroyer surface action group proceeded to kill the limping Japanese battleship and sank the accompanying cruiser.


Naval fog of war rocks! :-)

Axis and Allies at its best.  The redesign this game had been waiting for, for over 25 years.  The first version of this game to beat the original for quality of components too.  The volume and quality of them are of jaw dropping magnitude.

The game play is also vastly superior to other editions.  And it also allows for 6 players, and better allows stronger and weaker players to play together (because the strongest players can play the weaker nations).

Probably the definitive A&A experience with games that last multiple, multiple hours as the thematic elements and complexity are greatly enhanced. (Though I'm told that A&A Europe 1940 and Pacific 1940, when combined into their 'Global' form is the ultimate A&A game.)

If I was forced to pick a favourite game it would be a hard choice but in the end I'd have to pick Axis and Allies.  I know it takes a long time and there's a lot of down-time and the design is, dare I say it, maybe a little old fashioned, but ...

... I just have so much fun playing it.

This new edition does everything right.  The components (particularly the new board) are all brilliant, the rule tweaks all seem to work for the better (strategic bombing works better, subs are worth buying, etc.), the inclusion of Italy and China is a great move and the new cruiser unit rounds out the naval options nicely.

Top marks!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It's more balanced than earlier editions by adding Italy (more balanced because of technologies, national advantages and other optional rules. With 3-2 players, more optional rules lead to an Allies advantage). And FINALLY, the game board is of adequate size! However, some backdraws have not changed - its much too long with experienced players. Last play lastet 8 hours, and still, no clear tendency regarding the outcome was to be seen.

I think if played with low luck rules (only then of course!), this game may well be one of the heaviest ever made.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I bought this due to my past love of Axis and Allies, which was a sacred game for me in middle school, high school, and college.

I bought this after reading the fixes to the base game and I was hooked.  The R&D isn't a gamble now and you have better control in it.  I like the additional units (cruiser, destroyer, artillery) to the game, which provides better options in those areas.  I like how they used some past variant rules for the subs and battleships; and fixing some of the costs and combat values of all units.  I like how there are more territories and victory cities, so the first few round moves aren't always the same.  I liked how the strategic bombing raids were improved to reduce industrial complex output.

I'm mixed with Italy and China additions to the game.  I like them there for historical aspects.  I like how one can add another player.  Italy is a weak country and thus made Germany's options more difficult with a weak Italy taking up resources and have little production.  China can be confusing and disappointing that they cannot counterattack Japanese forces on the other side of their border or merely in the adjacent sea.

While I like the national objectives, it added extra layers of things to track and bloated up the game.  People didn't like playing with them.

I wish there were better guides or options to know "how balanced" the 1941 vs 1942 vs with objectives vs without objectives.

This version is pricy and we had issues with the unconnected boards moving during the setup and game.

Overall this basically obsoletes my old Axis and Allies.

It's better than the previous edition but it still has the classic flaws of Axis & Allies. Frustratingly long downtime between turns. The losing players typically have to face a long, steady decline that's no fun (unless they do something drastic and desperate that just makes them lose faster). Somewhat inflexible in terms of number of players (though Germany and Italy can easily be controlled by the same person). The game design feels a little crude sometimes, and historically absurd situations will sometimes happen. And while I've only played it a couple of times so far, I think it will begin to feel as stale as the previous edition after a few more games. That said, the changes from the previous edition (some of which seem rather radical) generally seem like improvements to me, and I've had more fun playing this edition than I think I ever had with the previous one.

A gorgeous, gorgeous presentation.  Everything from the miniatures to the boxes has been well thought out, although the ships are difficult to tell apart.  The map is bigger, but still too crowded.

Allies won, but it could have gone either way.

RATING: 5
This game is so fun, especially as you see the map ebb and flow, the armies of figurines and ponder your opponent's weaknesses, but it just takes way too damn long (at least 6 hours) and outstays its welcome. Between players of sufficient skill who show no weaknesses, it can take the accumulation of lucky dice rolls and one stupid mistake to turn the tide, and that can literally take forever. The game just encourages way too much turtling.

[u]Notable changes from Revised[/u]
 - Decidedly neutral about Italy. It tacks on a ton of game-time to an already long game, but it does balance out the downtime in a 1v1 game. Strategically, the biggest effect of including Italy is that it makes a D-Day landing from the British and Americans much harder, since the Italians go between the two.
 - Much prefer the inclusion of China. The China rules are very thematic in illustrating the weak, scattered but enduring resistance and hardship of any Axis attempt at conquering China. All without adding any game time at all.
 - The new transport (and other naval) rules make a lot more thematic sense now and make convoys a necessity (whereas transports were just meatshields before).
 - I was never a fan of the technology rules, but it's good to have the re-roll of the researcher dice every turn. Less weird than before, and the randomness of it gives technology and research a more adapt-to-situation feel, instead of falling back on your favorite technologies.
 - I like the map artwork, enlarged map (territories comfortably hold lots of armies now) etc. This game undeservedly has a lot of whiners about it. The boards all warp, though not enough for a negative play experience.

No way I'm ever going back to Revised, thanks to the huge board and well thought-out components + storage trays.

[2 plays] 2 player rating: 7. Multiplayer rating: 6. First time:4 players, six hours, another 1 to 2 hours unplayed to definitively wrap up. Second time: 6 players, 4-5 hours, Allies surrendered after the fall of Moscow with Italy romping through Africa and the Med, and Japan going wild in the Pacific.

It is the pure length of this game that keeps me from giving it a higher rating. Otherwise very enjoyable. I love the national advantages being a motivational keystone for the action of each nation.

I look forward to some 2 player matches (when there is sufficient time) and I'd love to try this pbem if that becomes available.

I need to play this again, but I'm pretty sure it's going to be an improvement over the old Milton Bradley version I own. It's certainly the most beautiful edition of the game ever produced, from the colorful map to the individual styles of the playing pieces. The nation specific rules and the large number of territories and sea zones are an improvement, but there may be some flaws. For example, I think battleships have gone from being underpowered to overpowered. And it's still a long and ponderous game by contemporary standards.

The main interest of this for me was in the Italian sculpts. It might be, as it appears to be the general consensus, the best of the series, but I definitely dislike the national objectives. They are fiddly - especially considering how light the game is, and how it seems to be targeted - and do not make any sense in terms of simulation. Overall I'm glad to own it, but it certainly does not deserve the price tags it is currently selling at.

Simply the best edition of this game to date.  I've only known the 1st and 2nd edition of the games to date, previous to this edition unfortunately.  I love the new units that I never knew existed in this series before (cruisers, destroyers, artillery), the addition of Italy and China, the addition of more map spaces (especially increasing the length of Siberia), the revamped Research & Development rules and the National Objectives. Bad luck in dice can sour the experience, as in all games, but I continue to want to play it because its a simplistic game of WWII that can usually be completed in less than 6 hours.

I've only played this once, but I can already see that I think this is the ultimate version of Axis & Allies that is available at this time.  If you can get your hands on this, and you are an A&A fan, then I believe that this is the one that you want to own.

As far as I'm concerned, I like Axis & Allies alright, but I think it takes a long time.  Too long for the amount of game you get, I feel like the turns can become very scripted, and you are always making similar plays as you usually do, however, the dice add the variety in whether you accomplish goals or not.

I don't think I would ever consider playing this as a five or six player game anymore I don't think.  I just don't feel like the downtime is worth it.

Please make them stop producing these games!!! Remove the WW2 theme completely because it has absolutely no connection to reality whatsoever.

I am a fan of Axis and Allies. I own this Anniversary edition. I'm not a fan of the Anniversary edition. Why? Not because it's not a good game within itself, but because it was a completly unnecessary game in the wider Axis and Allies context. Hard to rate a game too high when you look at it and are upset because it exist.

I probably overrate this a bit, but I was a rabid Axis and Allies player all through high school, so I'm heavily influenced by the nostalgia factor. I think the changes made in this edition are definitely improvements, but I hate split boards!

I sold it at Gencon for a nice profit since 1940 versions were coming out.

Probably a mistake but it is what it is.

As the price continues to climb this is one of those games that i wish i had purchased when it came out. It's a great game but the lenth to play tends to bring down my enjoyment. I want to give it a 10 for being one of my favorite games growing up (1981 version) but i just can't.

Wow, the best version ever! They worked hard on that one to come up with a unique experience and nailed it right.

Every aspect of the game as been enhanced from the board dispositions to the rules.

I recommend highly if you can get a hand on the few copies available.

WRONG!!!!

This is just a rip off! Mostly borrows aspects and news unit sculpts from A&A revises, A&A Europ and A&A Pacifc and A&A Guadacanal, that came out earlier.

New italian units ; BROWN !!! LIKE A TURD !!!

The main reason i give it a bad rating is because of the overhype pricing that games get on ebay and else : dont pay more than 300$, you shouldn't even pay more than 100$....

Reason is you can get same/better gameplay experience with the newer version like A&A 1942 2nd edition and A&A Global 2nd edition ; for a much affordable deal.

Well, it's A&A, it pushes all those buttons, and it's better than prior iterations.  Components are cool, too, esp. the trays, and even the box is pretty good, though ludicrously huge.

But I really have to wonder at the victory conditions, which are still some kind of Dark Ages of Gaming monstrosity.  Who plays to complete conquest?  Why bother with the "standard" 15 VCs when it's functionally identical with 18?  They needed the equivalent of the IPC victory from original A&A.  But I'll happily play to 13, as frankly I won't play it often enough to care.

RATING: 5
Slightly disappointing but that's probably because I expected something this game couldn't deliver. I've never played any previous editions too.

So anyway: the feel, the theme, the immersion, the scale are amazing. I love it how when playing Japan you barely know what's happening in Europe but when playing the UK you need to split your resources world wide. There is much to like in this game, the fleets, the armies, the grand strategy (do I keep up the pressure on the US or kill China and India? Do I conduct Barbarossa or try invading England?)

But then I realized that it's pretty shallow. Only so many options, only so many unit types, only so many strategies. It's also very random. Dice can win you battles you weren't supposed to win. I normally like dice because they like me but in my two games I twice easily won battles like: 2 carriers (defending) killed 3 fighters and a bomber with no losses; 3 DD, 1 BB, 1 CR killed 1 BB, 2 DD, 2 subs with no losses.

I think that generally as a gamer I'm gravitating towards heavier, deeper games so maybe Europe Engulfed is the next step? AAA just is just not enough for me.

RATING: 7
It's big! It's got China and Italy! It takes forever to play! It's still fun!

A few rule changes  make combat tactics different (especially at sea where the new transport rules though annoying do reflect what in real life the point of a navy was) and bombing a nightmare for germany once the yanks get heavy bombers :S but hey thats pretty realistic too

still lots of down time though and it is hard to play with more than 2 but less than 5 (well 6 but Italy won't last long) 

very good componants (some problems of clarification betwixt cruisers and destroyers for some countries though :S)

good fun though not a agme to be played on a whim starting at 9:30 pm! (clearly this was pete's fault)

When this game came out I was really torn about whether or not to drop $70+ on it.  I love A&A, but it's a huge box, a game that's only likely to get played a couple times a year, and I was saving up my game funds for the War of the Ring Collectors Edition.  Now that it's all gone and I've played it, I'm really kicking myself!

A&A Anniversary is awesome and I can't imagine ever playing vanilla A&A again. The national objectives (NOs) really stretch out the battlefield.  I've read criticisms that the NOs make the game more gamey.  Even though I've only played a couple games, so far, I disagree.  NOs give you more strategic options to pursue, making each turn far more interesting while incentivizing historicity.  The one drawback is that they are hard to keep track of if you don't play the game very often since they aren't visible on the board, but this is a very minor complaint.  It also seems like the research system is improved over past versions.

Since Jason owns a copy and he's likely to be my main/only A&A opponent anyway, I am fortunately not tempted to pay out the nose for it... yet.

A 10?  This looks like one that will stand the test of time.  The extra territories in Europe and Asia really change things by adding opportunities to feint and imply threat across several territories.  Who flinches first?!  Much, much, much improved.  Excellent map.  Improved rules.   Even some non-Axis fans gotta see the potential here.

Based on the main game my rating will probably go up when I've played it more. Adds Italy as a sixth nation to play giving the axis 3 players too.

The best of the new releases. A very good mix of a global scale with one additional country and modified "realism" rules. Not as grand as Global, but the faster play/setup time helps get it to the table.

A worthy trade of some of the MB version's easy playability for more detail (such as additional naval units, improved research, Italy as a separate power, and national objectives).  The visual appeal is improved, too, with a better-looking map.

RATING: 9
WW2, tonnes of miniatures, epic scale warfare where one decision can end your game when with the right group.  Most of our games can be traced back to one failed battle, a missed move, or even a botched purchase turn.  I think I enjoy this game so much just because of the constant tension throughout and knowing one wrong move will be the end for me and my teammates.  In my opinion, if you play with the same players over and over and get to know their strategies and how they think, the true fun of this game comes out, but getting to that point can be a long process.  Beating the odds and known/proven strategies (or trying to at least) is why I keep coming back for more.  Time and learning curve is an issue, especially when you have played several different editions, all of which have tweaks to the rules.

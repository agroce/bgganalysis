For the most part, this has similar mechanics to other Avalon Hills games I love: Across 5 Aprils, Russian Front, Tac Air....  Movement, Terrain/movement costs, zone of control, comparing numbers to get a ratio then consult the combat chart.
This does have enough tweaks and unique features so that it isn't exactly the same old thing.  Besides, who doesn't want to refight the Bulge???  Some elements are a bit "fiddly" but then I'm just trying this as a newbie.
The map and counters are superior in clarity and all around artistic quality!

RATING: 5
A good, workman-like, version of the Battle of the Bulge.  When it comes to this topic, it is always facinating to see how designers try to reinvent the wheel, even as "the wheel on the bus goes round and round, round and round, round and round."

Played on Dec. 16, 2010 - the 66th Aniversary of the start of the Battle of the Bulge.  Enjoyable for a strategic game, however it is long.  We didn't get to finish, that isn't a big deal as to me it was a learning game.  Definately will give it a go again.  It really isn't a complicated game.

Just bought this from a BGG member. Always wanted this one as it seems the best combination of historical accuracy and playability. Can't wait to play!

Update - 3/31/08: OK, I'm half way though my first play of this game (solo). This game ROCKS! It is easily going to become one of my all-time favorite traditional-style wargames. Both sides get to play offense, the history seems solid, and the gameplay is tense. I frankly don't know what more one could ask of a wargame. Oh, and the rules are a breeze to any average wargamer, so players can spend their time planning their strategy, not looking up rules!

Avalon Hill's last offering on the Bulge. I saw it and ordered by phone only to be told by the Lady on the other end that the"Hill" was closed and sold. 

Yikes....

Bought it later. I really miss that company.

Does anyone really like Hasbro ???????

The 4th edition is supposed to be definitive, but I got this in a trade and I'm quite pleased. The game has just enough chrome for flavor while remaining mostly simple.

UPDATE: Picked up the Compass game deluxe edition. Wonderful. So I traded this to a friend. Enjoy your new home! :)

One of the last games published by Avalon Hill.  A good design that emphasises on troop quality in addition to raw combat power.  Just wished that the mapboard came mounted.  Later editions by various game companies remedied this while further refining the rules.

AH version see L2 delux..both versions are, best for competitive gaming, while providing the overall feel of the battle. It still has some nice flavor, such as combined arms, Peiper's breakout etc....one minor drawback for me was the gamey tactic of sending Panzer Lehr on a 20-30 mile road trip behind the German lines to attack the US armored Cav in the L-gap.... In effect... this results in a free set up option for the Germans.

RATING: 7
This is a very solid hex and counter wargame.  I have only played the shorter (tournament) scenario without the optional rules so my experience here is very limited.  The game seems to model the Battle of the Bulge nicely with a minimum of complexity.  It offers opportunity for creative manuever and rewards solid tactical play.  On the negative side, it can run a bit long and it's a bit too tempting to try to "math" your way towards the optimal combat ratios.

RATING: 8
What? Another Bulge game?  When will the American become tired in this theatre? This one is the first from Randy Heller on the Battle of the Bulge.  It is later published by MMP and L2 with updated maps and counters graphics.  And it continues to sell well.  So the game speaks something.  The AH version is the first edition and has a detaield map.  The game also featured numerous leaders of both sides.  Monthy, Patton, Dietrich and Peiper are just some of them and their names alone already hold your breath. The designer also has an edition by himself and the counters made by Rich Ogata for the German Army is shinning purple.  I own the L2 edition.  More gaming on this excellent game just grows more on me.  Competitive and fun.  This should be the mother of all Bulge game.  I should play this game every year in December. The game uses classic wargame conventions and system.  So it's easy to pick it up and play.  One thing I don't like is the rather restricted rules on the division of army boundary.  Many scenarios to choose from and thus the game has a high replay value.

Not one of the great bulge game out here, some good ideas, some weird "research" (Otto Remer was not a good commander...), and a game ending before the counterattack (even if I have read the new "designer edition" expands the game). The supply rules are strange and unrealistic. Yet it produces reasonable results and play quite fast.

(Own 2nd Edition).  Bitter Woods is a very good Bulge game that's easy to get into.  The game's mechanics are familiar to anyone who plays wargames and there's a surprising amount of chrome for such a short and simple rules set.  

Bitter Woods seems chess-like in its execution and my one concern is that it can be very unforgiving if you make a bad move.

The ultimate refinement of Battle of the Bulge by Avalon Hill. Excellent map and pieces. Clear rules that, while plentiful, don't bog down play. Fortified cities never lose zones of control, which may or may not be a good thing, depending on your perspective. I mounted my board on ancient AH blank boards long since out of print. Worth the effort.

RATING: 6.5
Another of the many Bulge games. For me ranked in the medium/top level. Simple mechanics but complex strategy, so it is a good game if you like to face strategic situations. If your are a experienced gamer, you will learn the rules in a couple of hours. Too complex set-up and a slow timing in the game resolution and therefore a little bit boring. In the other hand, interesting balance between Allied superiority as the game advance against German initial surprise advantage. For the Allied player: look out for the german strategic armored units movements, it can be the key for a victory or a total defeat. It is more a game for defending than attacking so a draw is the logical trend. Anyway, a must have in any serious wargamer collection.

Probably the best regimental level game on the topic. That scale keeps it to one map and very manageable, but enough detail to keep it interesting. Clean rule set, nice components.

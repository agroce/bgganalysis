RATING: 8
You have to know going in that there is tons o randomness, back-stabbing, and chaos.  But with that in mind, it is an extremely fun game.  It has gotten me into reading the books, and the more I read, the more I appreciate the characters and events on the cards.

RATING: 7
I am a fan of the Terry Pratchett books. This game makes a commendable effort of distilling the locations and people from the books into a board game. It's quite interesting to play, too, though some roles seem to have it easier than others at winning the game.

I am probably biased with my rating, being a Pratchett fan.

Discworld:Ankh-Morpork is a fun game with plenty of unexpected turns. Has cards, minions, money and buildings, and random events, that do not overpower strategy. Has confrontation, but if you know Discworld, you know it's nothing personal, that's just how Ankh-Morpork is. Your secret winning condition needs to be filled at the beginning of your turn to win. Works well with all of the advertised number of players (2 to 4). Plays always just under an hour.

Very entertainig game by Martin Wallace, probably because of the fantasy novel background. Also, easy to learn, very comfortable experience even for 1st game.

RATING: 8
A very clever use of the Discworld theme. The board map is beautiful and the large variety of characters/cards is very nicely done and thematic without being too complicated. The flow of the game is reminiscent of some of the city watch books, but abstract enough that it isn't trying to emulate a specific book story, which is awesome.

RATING: 8
Judging from the amount of FUN had by all, I think that while this title is a little chaotic, that's OKAY! As a fan of Pratchett's work, I found the cards to be highly thematic. Well done -- again -- Martin!

RATING: 8
Big Pratchett fan so I am a bit biased. Game feels quite random/chaotic at times but well fits the theme of Ankh-Morpork. There is a fair bit of planning/strategy, and certainly silly moves would cost dearly - but no real way of mitigating what cards you draw/play, only what you do with them.

Still, the asymmetric victory conditions, and the fun to be had cannot be easily dismissed.

RATING: 6
A very light game of card drawing and making the most of what you have, while aiming for secret goals. The area control aspects are extremely simplistic and the card play is only a small step up from Fluxx. It's very random, with little strategy, and its Lords-of-Waterdeep aesthetics can only serve to mislead players into expecting something more than it really is. Slight, chaotic fun.

RATING: 8
Buen y divertidísimo juego de control de áreas, con motor de cartas, muy bien ambientado en Mundodisco, con apoyo de tablero donde cada zona ofrece una ventaja cuando construyes edificio en ella. Los eventos lo hacen un Caos... como la propia ciudad xD Todo aquel con el que lo he probado, le ha encantado y si eres fan de Pratchet recordarás personajes y escenas con las cartas. De 2-4 pero mejor con 3 o 4 jugadores, a 2 pierde mucho. Muy divertido, entretenido, fácil de explicar y de jugar! incluso con no jugones, se entiende muy rápido

Excellent game. The assymmetric winning conditions are very clever and this feels like a very balanced game.

Having played this some more, I think the balance is skewed to Vimes, Vetenari and Chrysoprase. In a 4 player game, it's too difficult for the others to win as everyone just bashes anyone close to winning.

Okay game, the theme doesn't resonate with me, I just see an area control game with very few options (add/remove minions/trouble). Seems too easy to prevent all win conditions from occurring on your turn, first focus on stopping anyone winning and then try to improve your position as subtley as possible. I only won my game of it because of the random event otherwise the players would have successfully prevented me all game. So with a group of good gamers I expect the game is broken towards either the luck of the draw/events or the deck exhausted win condition.

RATING: 6
Incredibly busy game.  The other players were playing cards like mad, which made me quite angry when I only got to play one card per round.  The strange thing is I had a come from behind victory.  I really didn't enjoy this game due to the way it felt like everyone had the ability to do multiple things, while I did not.

RATING: 9
A very nice, easy to learn work replacement game with mechanics that really fit the discworld theme. The game also plays fast (40-60min)and its deduction element is very clear with enough overlap to make guessing which character a person is a challenge. The player aids allows every player to check which character the other player could be easily. Only downside is some players might look at the game and take the game as a pure work replacement game and concentrate on their own objectives only, which can lead to a very quick win for one player with no contest to his goals. 
A good game with good mechanics and theme which trumps Lord of Waterdeep for me personally. Although that is still a game I like too.

RATING: N/A
I've read enough reviews to understand its strengths and weaknesses, but still cannot get a sense for whether its strengths will strike that cord with me so that its weaknesses melt away from my caring.  I am a Terry Pratchett fan, but my friends are not... though the theme may be enough to carry the game for me, the game may not be enough to convey the theme, and intended fun experience, to my friends.  It is something I'd have to try before I buy.

RATING: 8
A light-hearted strategy game where you assume the role of a noble from Ankh-Morpork, and try to win by accomplishing it's task. The gameplay is fairly simple: you draw cards and execute the orders from them. There is much interactions and you have to be very attentive what your opponents do, because not only winning counts but also not letting anyone else grab the victory.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The game was fairly fun, with lots of area control, attacking each other, and card combos. The game also suffered a little from being a little too random. After playing it twice, we saw most of the cards and the game felt explored. Drawing cards that are wildly different in power means that you can fall behind or get ahead, too much based on luck of the draw.

Reasonably light-weight game. Lack of play testing shows because the personalities assigned at the start of the game can vary greatly in their difficulty. Played mostly with 2 players but when we played with 4 players the game was somewhat better balanced. Overall, it doesn’t hit the table often.

RATING: 3
It must help to be a Pratchett fan, familiar with the setting and the many characters on the cards.  If, like me, you're not, Ankh-Morpork offers area control with lashings of take-thatery,  a heavy dose of chaos, and highly tactical play determined by the cards you hold this turn.  The secret objectives seem poorly done; most quickly become obvious and the default winner when the deck runs out seems much the easiest to achieve.

The artwork is quite lovely and the resin models in the deluxe edition that I played are very nice.

Fun, light-hearted game, with a bit of take that and a very good theme for Pratchett fans. One wrong move from a player overlooking the fact that the next player might be about to win can hand him the victory without other players being able to do anything about it. Not one to take too seriously but enjoyable when you're in the mood for a silly game with lots of banter and plenty of randomness.

Not that bad...a bit too random and luck driven with the cards.  The game is...all card play with card effects.  Have fun watching people play their cards with card effects?  Not so much.  Plus, secret goal games are just not that interesting to me.  So not much here for me.

Divertido y caótico juego por objetivos asimétricos, con mecánica de mayorías por el control de áreas. Se deben generar estrategias para lograr objetivos individuales asignados de forma aleatoria, de tener la mayoría de peones en cierta cantidad de sectores de una loca ciudad, generar conflictos en todos lados, tener más dinero, que se acaben las cartas sin que nadie gane, entre otros. Eso si, no se tiene tanto control como se espera, de un turno a otro pueden cambiar mucho las cosas, por lo que las estrategias reactivas son mejores que planificaciones a largo plazo.

El motor del juego es el mazo de cartas.

One of those punch-everyone-else-in-the-face-until-no-one-wins games.  There is a winner, it's just really hard to meet your objective.  Fell a little flat with me, but I'd try again.

Second play was better, maybe because I had played a really bad game right before.  But I did appreciate it more.  Still a little too random for me - it's too easy NOT to get helpful cards - but I bumped it up from a 6 to a 7.

Just love every bit of it, 

- the theme (I love Terry Pratchett's books ... recently bought The Last Hero), 

- the gameplay (every player has a secret personality, there are 7 characters and 5 different strategies), 

- the nice board and components and the outstanding art in the cards, 

- the bluffing (you must hide your true personality behaviour on the board ... at the same time you struggle to get your actual goal),

- the wizards (random events, chaotic outcome of rolling a die ... this is so Ankh-Morporkian!), 

- Ankh-Morpork is a light and fun game, easy to learn, easy to teach, and easy to play (play a card, fill up to five)

I expect I would enjoy this more if I'd read the DiscWorld books I've read more recently, or had read more of them.
As it is, there seems to be a large element of needing to work against the opponent next in turn order to ensure they don't win. If any player doesn't play that way the game could easily be won by a player that wasn't countered.

Előre felkészítettek rá, hogy káoszos a játék. Tényleg az:) Tervezni legfeljebb akkor lehet, ha a többiek nagyon nem figyelnek oda. De egyébként elég hamar sejteni lehet, hogy kinek mi a célja, és többnyire sikeresen akadályozhatóak a többiek céljukban. Egyetlen kivétellel: a pakli elfogyása előbb vagy utóbb bekövetkezik, ezt a célt nem lehet megakadályozni! Ez elég nagy hiba, én ezt erősebbnek érzem így elsőre a többinél. Ami fura volt, hogy lement egy 1 órás parti, és se troll, se a démon egyáltalán nem került a játékba. Gondolom ez valami különösen nagy véletlen lehetett.
A játék szép, de se a témája nem áll hozzám közel, se a mechanikájában nem találok olyan különlegeset, ami miatt felkeltette volna a figyelmemet. Wallace helyében inkább megmaradnék az ennél összetettebb játékoknál, ebből valahogy hiányzik a kihívás. Ezzel együtt egy próbát megért, akik a káoszt (vagy a témát) szeretik, és a némi nyelvfüggőséget elfogadnak, azoknak ajánlom.

This absolutely the lightest Wallace's game ever! I am a fan of Discworld novels, so I am an easy target for this game...
It is a very fun, quick and chaotic ride through the lights and shades of the (Disc)world's most interesting city: the turns are very fast, with players playing one card and applying the effects in order. There's a bit of randomness, a bit of take-that, a bit of nastyness... indeed all the things one can expect from a game with this theme!
Of course this ain't Brass or Age of Steam, but it is a very enjoyable gateway game, that conveys the theme through the cards and great artwork.
The only true critic: the game lacks the very things that make the Discworld novels so great... the social critic filtered through british humour!

RATING: 1
I would think wallace puts more stock in his name than to put out something this bad.

I've played a 4 player game.

as a game this is faidutti-level chaotic, has noticeable downtime, has no interesting mechanic anywhere, and has the old-school ameritrash approach to adding chrome to the game (add lots of cards with names from the setting, but do not connect the mechanics to the theme at all).

bash-the-leader-until-vimes-wins.

I seriously doubt this is a genuine wallace...

wallace is famous for his distinct 'feel' in elegant game mechanics that make each game an exciting experience to explore for a eurogamer. NOT PRESENT.

wallace is famous for theming his games by ingenious mechanics that manage to represent the subject matter (with god's playground perhaps top of the world in this regard), and not by hoping throwing random effect cards with familiar names/flavor text will evoke theme. NOT PRESENT.

faidutti is famous for a distinct feel to his games that wallace fans can expect not to experience in a wallace. PRESENT :-(

all this would get a disappointed 3-4/10 from me, but what is inexcusable is that the game SCREAMS 'not balanced/tested'. wallace had this amazing ability to put out games that were chvatil-level balanced, every time. the spielbox game perhaps was a first warning something changed and this isn't important to him anymore...

the cost of the building seems totally random compared to their abilities, especially what with the strongest building being given away for almost free to first person in turn order to hold a build buildings card. some of the cards just feel too strong to the point of breaking the game.

the last and most crucial to me problem was the characters - in a 4 player game it felt impossible for anyone to set up any of the conditions for the winning the game, bashing anyone close enough to any of the winning conditions was trivial every time. there was no need to guess who has which character, you easily stopped them all. perhaps for casual gamers this will be a no-issue as people will not notice others getting close to winning, but for wallace fans it's not terribly likely.


chaotic-bashTheLeader-ATLevelTheme games will never be my cup of tea, but this one just didn't seem to work. my final call is: BROKEN (1/10) 


(this is after ONE game, it's quite possible the rating will change with more plays)

With 4 people I think that this is unplayable. It is so easy to stop people from achieving their goals that there is no way that you will be able to achieve your win condition in your turn and none of the three other players will do nothing about it. Our all four player games were won by the guy who won when nobody achieves his win condition before the deck ends. Perhaps the role that wants to earn a certain amount of money has some chance but if after dealing the roles you know in more than half the games that you have no chance of winning then why bother playing this?

Stay away from this.

Initial Impression: If Martin Wallace was trying for chaotic, he definitely succeeded with this game. The play is very card driven, which makes it tough to plan any longterm strategy. My favorite aspect is that the objectives are random and hidden. I've read the Discworld books and I'm afraid to say that the theme just didn't shine through for me in this game.

RATING: 7
Preliminary rating of 7 based on two play test games at Kubla Con.  There is more randomness than I am used to in a Martin Wallace game.  I am not familiar with the books, but apparently this is thematic.  As players become more experienced they will be able to better control the chaos.

Great game, as long as everyone is playing at the same experience level. Very easy for experienced players, even if they've only played once before, to stomp new players. It takes a game or two to get used to watching out for the multiple game ending scenarios, which is key to working out who has what secret role - the core that drives the game on.

Painful to play. Winning conditions happen at the start of your turn.  You get close to winning, but people can anticipate, so they tear you down before your next turn.  Strategy probably involves sneakily winning. I'm less interested in that kind of strategy.

A somewhat chaotic area control game with strong take-that elements. I'm not familiar with the books but the theme came through well and was fun. The best part of the game is the variable win conditions and trying to suss out who is trying to do what while also furthering your own ambitions. It's not a hard game to learn or play...definitely on the lighter side but also a fair bit random with card draws and events. Know that going in.

This game is exactly what you would expect from a discworld game. It's chaotic with a lot of take that elements. It's quite chaotic with the everchanging board positions. The events add a fair bit of chaos into the mix. While the cards provide the game with a much needed infusion of chaos. Did I already mention it's quite chaotic? But most of all it's fun to play and it's quick. This means you'll just play another game when you were stomped upon before. An absolute must have for Discworld fans. A nice take that game for everybody else.

Picked up slightly damaged collectors edition. 
While most of the set is in really good, played condition, except for
- Sam Vimes personality card has some peeled art on the front face (though since the seven Personality cards spend the game face down). 
- Cheery Littlebottom has a bit of discolouration on the back of her card. 
- one of the player reference cards has been damaged too - was stuck to Vimes. But there are three spares of that.

RATING: 7
Pro's:

1) The special victory conditions add a great deal to the game. Though I wouldn't say they are all equally balanced, I have yet to see anyone win as Chrysoprase.
2) Aesthetically I love it, the little details on the map of the city are pretty fantastic.
3) IF you are a Terry Pratchett fan, a lot of the card effects really make sense from the way they interact with the game.
4) It is a great intro into area control.
5) There are some potent and fun card combos you can pull off that can be really unexpected and create a totally new turn dynamic.

Con's:

1) The game can be over really quickly if players don't recognize when someone is close to winning. It can be really frustrating when you see someone is about to win and two other players do nothing to try and stop them. I think this comes from the visuals and the mechanics feeling kind of busy and overwhelming to some people.
2) I wish there were more types of victory conditions.
3) The game isn't massive on variety, since you basically stack the deck the same way each time.

Special note:

This was the first modern board game I purchased. For a good year or more it was all we had and all we played. Realistically the rating has probably dropped due to the amount of plays, I am sure I would have rated it higher during that period. I will never get rid of this game though since it is a piece of history and is what brought me into the hobby.

At last, a Wallace game I don't hate. This is a light, fun, take that sort of game with an element of strategy. The design is not simple enough to introduce to newbies but this is a simple game for gamers and has all of the randomness and some of the over/underpowered cards that you would expect from this sort of game.

Play it if you love the theme. It is fun enough.

RATING: 3
Soulless and pointless, Ankh-Morpork lacks in both ideas and originality: all you have to do all the time is drawing cards and seeing what you can get out of them, no other skills or strategies are needed. If you’re lucky you can even play a combo with your cards once or twice and that’s all, for it is also your most exciting moment in the whole game. 

Buildings can be taken as the epitome of Ankh-Morpork’s flimsiness: you feel compelled to build houses but houses are useless, for they cost too much, give too little and are prone to be ravaged at the first sneeze around the table. In the end, there’s no substance (and even less testing) behind the notorious Discworld setting.

The game’s art is gorgeous though.

A surprisingly thematic, family weight Euro game based on Terry Pratchett's Discworld.  This is an area control style game that is driven by batshit insane cardplay.

Very light game with some depth in the area control mechanics.  The fun is in the theme.

RATING: 2
Very chaotic and imbalanced. This is cardgaming at its worst. Sometimes you randomly get to do 4 powerful actions while another player only gets to do 1 weak action. Usually noone can meet his victory condition except for the guy who just wants the cards to run out, so basically everything just depends on the cards drawn and dice rolled. There is very little skill involved.

I must start this comment by stating that I've never read any book of DiscWorld.

I agree that the game fits at the theme (as I payed it with people that read all the books), but...

I'm rating the game just as a game. There is little to no control on what you do and what others do to you. 
The character that is assigned to you at the beginning will define your strategy, but that is impossible, because there is little to no strategy or control.

I can play it again, but now I know that I can win the game without doing much for it, and probably I'll lose the game without having any chance to win it, although I made everything right.

Update - Jared of Whitleypedia and Catweazle/Whithywindle rate this game. It must get to the table now.

Further update - I didn't get it because it's a worker placement game, never played one of those before so it didn't really make sense. I've bashed through the rules and a couple of turns and It suddenly looks quite straightforward.

RATING: 7
This is based on one play; the rating could go up. It's an area control game with a "take that" element and asymmetric, hidden victory conditions. That precipitates a lot of conjectural, sometimes half-serious negotiations which can be pleasingly diverting. The cards themselves, particularly if you're a fan of the Discworld novels (as I am) are just funny to look at. Even players who knew nothing of the novels laughed at seeing "Gaspode" pop up and ruin plans again. The cards allow you to make two or three turn mini-strategies which chain throughout the game. Since the gameplay seems to call to mind the word "management" more than a word which equals the whimsy of the cards, I can't really rate it higher than a seven at the moment. Again, this may change. I recommend it especially to fans of the Discworld novels who would appreciate a medium weight three to four player take-that game. There aren't many games that occupy that niche in mu collection so I look to hold onto it and get more plays in the future.

RATING: 4
Provisional rating - might change if I play it more (downwards I suspect).

If you're a fan of the books then I suspect you'll enjoy this much more, doubling my rating ...

So theme is lost on me, as I have no idea who the personalities are, just the overall theme of a fantasy city ... but some stuff I like - (potentially) short, very different hidden objectives. 

And stuff I really don't - lots and lots of randomness/chaos, players can give another player the game if they're not paying attention to *all* the victory conditions, so near the (potential) end it can collapse into AP hell as players worry about setting someone up. Unbalanced cards - if you never draw a building card you can't build ... and these seem quite good for end game vps (converting cash to vps) but also vulnerable to chaotic random events. Cards that let you play cards will extend your turn and seem rather better than the ones that don't. Despite the objectives your turns are very tactical - maximise what you can do now and don't do something to let the player to your left win ...

Overall not a game I'd ever suggest and I'd rather play something else, but I would play again, at least once more (hmm, I'm talking myself into dropping the rating to a 3 after writing this - but I will wait to try it again first).

Juego ambientado en el mundo de Terry Prachet: Mundodisco. En su turno, el jugador se limita a jugar cartas y hacer combos que le pueden permitir putear al prójimo, ganar dinero, activar eventos y/o actuar sobre el tablero, construyendo edificios o introduciendo "secuaces". El tablero está dividido en 12 zonas y en cada una de ellas se evaluan mayorías.

Al principio de la partida se reparten personajes de forma oculta, y según el personaje que te toque, tu objetivo durante el juego será uno u otro. 

LA verdad es que es bastante caótico y no da pie para la planificación...porque cualquier jugador puede desbaratarte los planes. La gracia está en vigilar qué estan haciendo los demás para tratar de averiguar qué personaje tienen. 

No ha sido un gran descubrimiento. Desde mi punto de vista, es prescindible. No soy fan de mundodisco, e imagino que eso influya. Hay mejores opciones en las que invertir algo más de una hora que puede llevar una partida.

2-4 | (4) | 60 min | 11+ | Martin Wallace

Light-hearted knife-fight in an Ankh-Morpork phone booth.

Easy-to-learn, easy-to-play area control game with hidden roles set in Terry Pratchett's books. Really enjoyable game as long as you don't take it too seriously (be sure lots of backstabbing will happen). While there is luck of the draw (some cards are better than others), there is more skill involved than you might think. The key is building a winning hand and strike at exactly the right time, while trying to stop other players from winning until then.

Fun game, ideal to finish a long session. My rating is closer to an 8 with the right group.

I can well understand the attraction for Discworld fans, as I'm told this uses the setting well and a wide range of characters from the books appear on the action cards.  For me, it's enjoyable enough but is a tad too random, mostly  due to an excess of 'take that' cards - though at least most games are short enough for that not to be a major problem.  If you're a Pratchet fan though, you may well enjoy it more than I do.

I wasn't really expecting much out of this title, as I'm completely unfamiliar with the theme and had heard this wasn't a very Wallace'y game, with lots of chaos and randomness.  While it's true that this isn't your typical Wallace game, I still had a good time, however!

Basically, on your turn, you'll play a card or two from your hand that does stuff for you.  The cards do stuff like add your minions to the board, build a building which gains you a special ability, get you money, remove other players' minions from the board, etc.

The goal is to achieve the goal on your character card.  Everyone has a secret character card, so players must watch closely to see if other players are nearing any potential win conditions, as you're never sure what people have!  Some players might be shooting for area majorities, one might be shooting for a bunch of money, one might be shooting for minions in a slew of different areas, etc.  So, there is a lot to watch out for as you try to deduce what goals the other players might have.

Overall, just a fun game that is a bit gamery, but at the same time not to be taken all that seriously.  Even good if you don't care about the theme!

Very random and dependent on the card draws.  I imagine this would be great fun for a Discworld fan but that is not me.  Kind of a weak area control-ish element with neat hidden victory objectives coupled with a random as heck deck of action cards that completely determine your options on your turn.

The deluxe set does look nice.

And I was right - this game oozes theme and is grea fun to play as you try and work out what the other players goal might be and try to stop there's while progressing your own. The Discworld is represented fabulously throughout all the cards that you play. I want to play more please. 21 Plays.

You needn't have any experience with Terry Pratchett to appreciate this game (although the cards might make you curious as to what sort of stories are populated by these ridiculous characters). However, the title, cover and "theme" all give off an impression of weirdness and insanity, making it hard to get non-Pratchett people to the table for this one. 

With that said, it's deceptively great. Let me explain...

On the surface, this seems like a fairly simple game. Play is wacky and chaotic, with ample opportunities to shake angry fists at opponents when they assassinate your little bowler-hatted meeples. I think I would have tired of that after a while. Thankfully, this game has layers. There's a level of intrigue underneath the zaniness. Every player has a hidden goal. The real challenge of this game is to see through the chaos of the gameplay and figure out what your opponents are secretly trying to accomplish.

I've never played Discworld with anyone who didn't enjoy it.

Quite good for a take that game. I enjoy how, unlike many games of this type (Cosmic Encounter, Munchkin...), it is on a clock. Like it or not, this game will end. It is also less swingy than I thought it would. There is more building up than tearing down, I appreciate that.

The game is weird.  It was ok but ended quickly because I didn't know what my husband's character's objective was.  I was more focused on just playing the game that trying to stop him which was clearly the wrong strategy.  I am not familiar with the books this game is based on so that's probably why I didn't really get into the theme of the game.  I wouldn't pick this game to play but if my husband wanted to play, I would give it another shot.  I would definitely have to be in the right mood to play it.

This game is pretty shitty...Chaotic, first of all.  The rule book sucks and has a bad misprint for one of the goals...you know, those things that you use to win the game that are really important...think you might proofread that?  Anyway, the movement of pieces on the board is really not interesting, and the swingy card options are just there to dick with people.  They rarely help you towards victory, but are built to keep others from winning.  What this means is that the person who drew the goal for the deck running out is likely to win. And if that goal wasn't selected, the winner will be whomever drew the best cards and had the least amount of bad stuff done to them.  Dumb...The only reason you should buy this game is if the set of Pratchett books that are for nerds and mongoloids gives you a stiffy, and you want to chuckle giddily every time you draw one of these assinine cards with a character from one of these shitty books.  Otherwise, stay away...

Treefrog released a Collector’s Edition of the Ankh-Morpork game.

As well as having a different box cover, wooden coins, a larger map (620mm x540mm as opposed to 520mm x 430mm), and a poster with artwork from the game, the Collector’s Edition avoids the use of the number eight (for reasons that should be well known to those versed in Discworld lore). It’s not a big change, but it does mean the production of a special 12 sided die and the separate printing of the cards just to make sure the one with 8 on it has 7a instead (Treefrog will go to any lengths for thematic accuracy!). For those who wish to sleeve their cards you will need the standard European board game size, 59mm x 92mm.

RATING: 7.5
I was pleasantly surprised by this game and almost considering buying it after my first play – which is something I rarely do these days compared to my shopping spree a few years ago (just take a look at my ”previous owned” list)… After my second game, though, I’m not sure it has enough replayability, and the luck is probably a bit too much for what I generally like. However, Discworld is still a pretty good game that I would probably always be willing to play! 

The reasons are that it’s a quick game with some depth which includes quite a bit of the sweet “screw you” factor. Furthermore it has secret goals, and area majority is its main mechanic which is always a plus in my book as it’s my second favorite mechanism (WP being the undisputed number one). What makes the game somewhat unique is the secret goal each person holds throughout the game – these goals ensure that the game can come to an abrupt end! This is a great mechanic as you’re constantly trying to see if your opponents are close to winning. Of course, you might not know this as everybody is trying to disguise their real goals (though it can be quite easy to assess which goals each player owns, but this is generally a problem with this kind of mechanic). The various goals are truly very different (at least some of them), so you need to deploy different tactics in order to win. If you don’t instantly win at the start of your turn, the game will end by everybody tallying their points in the end – unless somebody has the secret character called Vimes, in which case this player wins… Speaking of Vimes, he seems slightly overpowered, at least in a 4p game, so I’m thinking that I might remove him. Of course, if you’re playing with 2 it might also be hard to win with him, so maybe 3p is the sweet spot?

The game worked very well with 3 and 4 players, even though certain secret characters seemed better or worse depending on the player numbers, even though the objectives try to handle this. The screw you factor is present indeed, but everybody knows that this is one of those kinds of games, so people don’t get mad. I think that it’s only because of the light-hearted nature of the game that I don’t get too mad at the excessive randomness in this game. The cards are very imbalanced; some are ridiculously good while others are completely crappy (and no, it’s not good under certain circumstances)! Furthermore, the event deck is very random and might screw you over, but it’s all good as the game takes less than an hour and is indeed enjoyable.
The tension that you have to suffer when you have actually completed your goal, but it needs to be your turn again in order to win, is great; often, the other players will notice that you might win if you have that specific character, so they attack you. It’s a great game of fighting back-and-forth and trying to complete your secret objective!

Shortish, fairly straightforward euro with Discworld theme. I liked the secret objectives. Not so keen on the take-that gameplay. Taught to my group by MW who took our all-out assault on his pieces in good spirit. Thanks, Martin.

Very light game for Martin Wallace perhaps because of the broader appeal its going for. Should become a better take that kind of game when players are more familiar with all the victory conditions.

You don't need to have any familiarity with the discworld books to be able to play but it definitely helps the theme if you do.

Game seems like chaos at first, but once you have some idea of the cards in the game there is much more strategy in it.  My wife and I like to throw out Vimes as a role card in 2 player games because it's too easy to defend against just one person.

RATING: 7
*7* (Initial play)
This game is highly random with swingy cards and lacks control, with all that said, it actually works and is enjoyable to play. The decisions come down to what crazy card(s) to play on one’s turn. There is also a little deduction determining which character everyone is. Surely this is best with 4 and should play in under 60 min. Looking forward to playing more.

I really appreciate the randomness and chaos in this game, which is very fitting for the setting of Ankh-Morpork. I love the secret hidden winning goals for each player, although new players don't understand the need to cover them at the beginning of the game and often zone out while they are being explained which leads to a second or third explanation later in the game. Does not require a knowledge of the source material to enjoy, however you will get a lot more chuckles out of it if you are familiar with it.
Thank you, Secret Santa 2011!!

Semi-light area majority game that plays in about an hour. Hidden roles with different winning jobjectives keep the players guessing till the end.  The cards are fun and really make it feel like your doing stuff on the board.  Fun factor is extremely high, and who can't grin getting the 'Peeled nuts' card, even if it is the worst card.

VERY interesting Wallace.  Don't be fooled by the naysayers who consider this game a foul bucket of randomness and Pratchett kitsch; this game is the real deal.  The rules can be explained in five minutes or less.  Don't bother trying to go throw the intricacies of the player relationships, just play a double header.  

I was initially totally underwhelmed.  But, once you realize that the building aspect of the game provides both information passing as well as a kind of action drafting the deck's roller coaster softens.  The hidden roles effectively turns a Tammany Hall style knife fight into a masquerade ball (knives still included).

Great work Mr. Wallace; I love it.

Game plays well with two, but shines with three or four.

This is a light, heavily themed and beautifully produced game. There is a lot of room for bluff (with the hidden roles).

The rules overhead is pretty low.  There is definitely some benefit to experience with the card distribution, but otherwise its pretty easy to just sit down and start playing within a couple minutes.

I look forward to some steady play from this game locally.  Being a Pratchett fan probably helps, but its a solid game on its own merits.

If you have played it once and am still unsure I would suggest you play with the maxium number of people several more times before you disregard it.

Amazing. Someone made a game based in Ankh Morpork with variable winning conditions - just like what I had thought of doing but never got past the basic idea.

Unfortunately it has almost the randomness of a Talisman style game but with almost no story and little charm.

Won as Vimes in 2 player. Long for what it is.

Really loved this game. Great mechanic, not too long and fantastic artwork.

11/11/12 - Still my favourite game.

2/1/13 - As much as I like this game, I can't justify its rating of 10 anymore. Playing new games has broadened my view of what it out there and there are simply better ones that deserve a higher rating. Commands & Colors, Descent & Puerto Rico all come to mind as superior games. 

2/2/13 - Played this one twice with Tom, Tegs and Josh. Both of the new players to the game (Josh and Tegs) won one game each. Still love this game, and I think now I have seen every hidden role type win the game.

Terry Pratchett halála után hallani lehetett, hogy a jogokkal baj lesz és nem lesz majd kapható a játék, úgyhogy gyorsan megvettem. Nem bántam meg. Nem árt persze ismerni a Discworld univerzumát, a regényeket, egy csomó kártya plusz értelmet nyer, ha ismered a sztoriját a rajta szereplő személynek, de anélkül is nagyon élvezetes a játék.

Ez volt talán az első olyan játékom amiben minden játékos  teljesen más célért küzd. Valaki akkor nyer, ha minél több területet ural, a másik akkor, ha kifogynak a kártyahúzó paklik, a harmadik ha felhalmoz egy bizonyos pénzösszeget, stb. Az is a játék része, hogy figyelj a másik vajon mire játszik, és aktívan akadályozd abban, hogy elérje a célját. 

A mechanika egyszerű: megjátszol egy kártyát, lejátszod a rajta lévő akciókat, majd visszahúzod a kezed a maxig a húzópakliból, ha kevesebb maradt, mint amennyi az alap kézméret. Akció az is lehet, hogy újabb kártyát kijátszol - ezeket lehet chain-elni, szóval van, hogy valaki csak pakolgatja lefelé a kártyákat a kezéből és egy lánckombinációval nyeri meg a végefelé így a játékot. Akcióval építhetsz tornyokat területekre, amikkel kapsz bónuszkártyát, ez belevisz plusz egy taktikai lehetőséget a játékmenetbe. 

Jó érzés belemerülni a Korongvilág univerzumába, a könyvek olvasása után a tematika is működik, de olyan is jól érezte magát játék közben, akinek semmit nem mondott Széltoló meg a Poggyász neve.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This game is mostly a 'feast of recognition' for those who read through the approximately 20 first Discworld novels. You can immediately recognise if someone has read the novels or not, by the way: ask them to pronounce the name of the very, [i]very[/i] scary Mr. Teatime. In my mind the characters look different, but it's fun to see them drawn, played and manipulated just the same.

Onto the game: there is much talk of it being a simple luckfest, but I don't buy that, at least not in its entirety. Martin Wallace is a better designer than that. The different ending conditions mean that you cannot play your own game: you have to be continuously on the lookout for these conditions to apply, and seek out means to avoid them from arising in the first place. And with the fiendish condition of Vimes in there (who will win if the the draw deck runs out) you cannot play entirely leisurely either. Your cards, randomly drawn as they are, nearly always allow you to do something useful, be it something constructive for your own position, or something destructive to prevent another condition from appearing on the board. It's not a complex mechanic by any means, and yes, there is likely to be something in the criticism that it makes play too tactical for 'serious gaming'... But it certainly doesn't make things [i]easy[/i]. I liked the game I played: it's not a great [i]game[/i], but I think this is a fairly rare example of a game which is perfect for once in every while.

Discworld + Martin Wallace = Win? Unfortunately this is bad maths. The characters are interpreted well as cards, however I can't help feeling that it lacks the spark to make it coalesce into a good game. The hidden roles are the key to winning, however they didn't feel good enough and Mrs Cake just ruins them. You could be trying to bluff that you might be following 2 different agendas at the same time, so that you are harder to disrupt, but then she looks at the remaining roles and can see the one you are bluffing as, that completely blows your cover.

Great game for fans of Discworld. Everything gets worse turn by turn and it gets crazy at the end of the game. The conquering mechanics is easy and makes sense, the resources need light management and the cards have an awesome mechanic.

It can be unfair sometimes, just because some cards at the end can turn everything 180º, but I think that is the spirit of Discworld.

I love this game! It occupies that area slightly more complex than a filler, but not enough to be the main game of a session.

At times, the abilities, effects, and characters make a lot of thematic sense, but for the most part being a fan of the Discworld series is merely a bonus and isn't necessary at all to enjoy or appreciate the game. 

That being said, it's a touch "take that" heavy, so despite its charms it can get a little cut throat -- one has to be mindful of the audience playing. Which is a shame, because my wife is huge Pratchett fan and this one is probably a bit too mean for her.

Well, the game is very interesting it requires both strategy and observation in order to win. Although the game is quite unbalanced there are some characters which are really easy to win with and other's with whome your are going to have a rough time with.

Light (for Wallace) take-that game of using actions on cards to improve your position in Ankh-Mopork. Can degenerate into a bash-the-perceived-leader game, but this is alleviated a bit by hidden victory objectives for each player. Having said that, those objectives tend to become obvious once you're close to them. I have a minor concern around the Vimes character winning if no one else does since stopping victors isn't hard with careful, co-ordinated play.
I love the way the Discworld humour has been integrated into the cards though. Pratchett fans will get a laugh from each card seeing how that character or location has been mapped to certain actions.

Discworld: Ankh-Morpork is an easy to grasp game. Each turn you play a card, do what it says and draw back to your hand limit. Rinse and repeat this procedure until one of the players reaches his secret win condition and ends the game. 
Since this is a card game, there is also luck involved, but to a certain degree it can be dealt with by using the districts' special abilities. What is much harder to control is the player induced chaos. To quote a friend of mine: "You can't really plan your next turn since it's quite certain that a lot of the board will have changed until it's your turn again". 
Strangely, this doesn't bother me as much as I would have expected. What keeps Discworld:Ankh-Morpork from getting a better rating is the fact that I simply don't have much fun while playing the game.

Luck, chaos, luck, chaos...

I was probably influenced by the name in the box. Wallace... So I expected a deep game witn few randomness. Apart from that, if you take it like a filler, than maybe it can satisfy you. 

I will try it a second time because I cannot assume that it is so bad!!

Very good for what it is trying to be, i.e. a fun cross-over game which engages with the theme - and it hits all three. Non-gamers will like this; it is light-hearted fun; and it captures the theme sufficiently (more than really) to make it a must buy for all Discworld fans. And it succeeds in doing this while still offering something for 'gamers' to enjoy.

If, however, you are expecting something of the weight of a normal MW game you will find this comes up a bit short - it actually feels a bit like Martin Wallace doing a Bruno Faidutti game.

RATING: 6
Players represent one of the notable persons of the city of Ankh-Morpork, trying to achieve their hidden victory condition.  Super simple game of placing and moving pieces around the twelve areas of Pratchett's Ankh-Morpork.  A player's turn is simply playing one or more cards, and following the icons that allow them to place minions, build buildings, take cash, and other assorted actions.   These should be driving you towards achieving your victory condition, which you have to hold until the beginning of your next turn, not an easy thing!  The victory conditions are nicely varied, although some appear more difficult to achieve than others - mainly because they are so obvious (such as "amass 50 cash", and "place 8 trouble markers").  Still, very light, breezy, random, but importantly ... fun.   This is no stodgy over-engineered Wallace game, it's more like a chaotic Faidutti game that actually works!  Well done.

Definitively not your typical Wallace game. While true to th boosk, the game ends up feeling rather random and chaotic. At its most basic level, it's a area majority game with hidden objective. Would rather play any other Wallace games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Overall this game is a lot of stuff from other games thrown into a blender. The way some cards chain is pure Dominion; the area control is classic El Grande, and the hidden agendas go way back to Illunati. Though the combination does feel unique.

My gripes are limited to the lack of any sense of control. Everyone is looking around beating back those who get near a victory condition. Your hand is really random, and with a finite amount of special actions you may never see some crucial ones come into your hand. 

We found it a very managable game to teach & learn in that the cards do all of the explaining.

There is some good stuff here, but I fear that the impact of the random events is too great in relation to the amount of strategy present in the rest of the game.  Imagine if you pieces in a territory could be randomly wiped out in a game of "China" and you'll get my drift.  Maybe this game is light from a Wallace point of view, but it's not so light that I don't get annoyed when my board position is destroyed by a random card draw.

Had the chance to play a fairly late prototype copy and I really enjoyed the game.  Sure it's was sans artwork and had what I assume are just stand-in bits (although they were good if they were the final pieces) but the game play and relationships between characters, buildings, etc. and actions was all there.

EDIT: Rating has gone up to an 8 after playing (and buying) the finished version.  Very fun, tense game that doesn't overstay its welcome, plays thematically and looks great.

My favourite family game for a while. Some of the hidden character objectives are much easier than others. Lord Vetinari is very hard, Dragon King of Arms and Commander Vimes are comparatively easy.

RATING: 8.5
Gyönyörű játék, pláne, h nekem a collector edition van, könnyedebb, mint egy Wallace játék, pedig ugye az. Azaz nem egy tipikus Wallace, már olyan szempontból, h nem a gamers game tagja.
Csak szórakoztatni akar, de azt jól teszi.
A Collector's editionben nyilván, ahogy a hangulathoz, és a helyhez illik, az a bizonyos 7 és 9 közti szám nem szerepel benne :-)
A kártyák gyönyörűek: tényleg a Korongvilág szereplői, olyanok, amilyennek az ember -vagy legalábbis én- elképzeltem a könyvek , vagy mint a 3 film alapján.
És nem véletlen módon vannak a szerepek (győzelmi célok) sem az egyes karakterekhez rendelve: a világ alapján: Lord Venitari pl nem véletlen sok helyen akar jelen lenni a győzelemhez, vagy Vimes parancsnok célja nem véletlen az, h senki ne tudjon semmi rossz fát tenni a tűzre, azaz lemenjen a játék anélkül, h bárki teljesítené a célját.
Szóval jók a szereplők, jók a kártyák: a Korongvilág nem csak egy ruha rajta, hanem beleillesztették a világba a játékot.
Ugyanakkor a játék alapvetően arról szól, és ezért aztán van interakció, h ugyan nyerni akarok, de folyamatosan megakadályozzam a többieket abban, h ők meg nyerjenek.
Egyetlen igazán nagy hibája van: durván nyelvfüggő: a kártyák egy jelentős részén szöveg is, ami egy plusz akció lehetőség. Vannak persze egyszerűbb szövegek is, de vannak picit hosszabbak is, nem mondom, h pár játék után a nyelvet nem tudok nem jegyzik meg - pláne ha ismerik a korongvilágot, de ettől még komoly nyelvfüggőség.
A játék idő is változatos: ha vki ügyesen eltereli a figyelmet akkor akár gyorsan is nyerhet, de ha jól észlelik a többiek h ki mit akar, és jól akadályozzák, akkor jóval hosszabb is lehet. nekünk 1x kb 40 perc, egyszer 1,5 óra volt - mindkét esetben 4 fővel.
Viszont végig érdekes marad, izgalmas, vidám, mókás.
Amit tudni kell még, h a "rajzolók" közt az eredeti Korongvilág grafikusai, művészei is jelen vannak, pl: Paul Kidby, vagy a a művész team vezetője: Bernard Pearson. Szóval nem véletlen, h a lapok úgy néz ki ahogy, és h "élethűek"

For fans of discworld they will love to see some of their favorite characters from the novels make appearances in this VERY fun game that has it all. It has strategy and tactics that are fun on every level. All players are dealt a random character. Each character has a goal to reach in order for that player to win. There are several different goals.  Not only do you have to watch the other players to figure out who they are and what their goal is to try and stop them, you have to also use your hand to reach your goal all the while making sure they don't know who YOU are.  You do not have to be a fan of Terry Pratchett or read a single discworld book to appreciate this game, but if you read the series like I do, every card is like an Easter egg. WOW that guy was briefly mentioned in Going Postal!  etc etc. I bought this game because I love the books...I love this game because it is balanced, fun with great art and a bit of that Terry Pratchett humor.

This is an area control game where everyone has a secret game ending goal. The area control is driven by card play. The cards themselves have various icons which allow you to do various actions. One of the icons is to play another card which allows you to chain actions. The crux of the game is trying to determine what other player's goals are while trying to obfuscate what your own are. There is a heavy dose of randomness and take-that, but it plays quickly, looks gorgeous and is pretty fun. I like it and would be happy to play it from-time-to-time.

This was one of the biggest hits at Essen 2011, it seemed that people were playing it everywhere. So I wanted to test it also but unfortunately I had to leave in the middle of the game because it was so frustrating. It's a pure family game with no twist to any order. Cards are boring because there is so many cards with the same function and many cards without any useful function.
 
Deluxe edition's meeples are gorgeous but the artwork in cards is dull when compared to Guards! Guards! A Discworld boardgame's illustration.

RATING: 8
This game combines a very fun hidden agenda mechanic alongside a ton of references which are great for a fan of the book series.
Having gotten quite a few plays done I still find myself wanting to have another go on boardgames night. My favourite character to play as is Commander Vimes as you can play towards several of the other goal conditions while messing with everyone else (in a recent play I started a turn with Chrysoprase, Vetinari and the Lords' objectives completed then promptly emptied the draw pile for a win! :D).

Short playing time and very nice artwork. Unfortunately, that about all I can say that's good about the game. 

It just doesn't look like a good game design. The victory conditions are messed up. It's like Bang! and that's not a favourable comparison. The victory conditions don't really match the characters anyway and that detracts from the theme, which feels pasted on. Plus the card powers are uneven and that amplifies luck-of-the-draw. Random and arbitrary - not the way to go.

[2 plays] I am not a fan of the Discworld books, so the theme here goes straight over my head.  I gather there's a bunch of stuff in the game that's hilarious if you get it.  From my perspective, though, I can say there's also a solid game under the theme.  I like the secret roles with different victory conditions.  I also like the mechanic of the cards with the actions you can do or not do, but in sequence.  Really there's quite a bit of fun stuff in this relatively short game.  It's something I wouldn't seek out, but won't mind playing.

Fun, funny and chaotic. I think I prefer it with 3 players instead of 4. With 4 players, everyone's possible objectives are much easier to be kept in check by the rest of the players, and the game usually ends on victory points (or Commander Vimes wins if in play). Update: In all but one games I have played, objectives are kept in check and game finishes when deck finishes, letting Vimes always win if in play. So imho Commander Vimes is overpowered with 4 players, just houserule not using him.

Yet another flaky Wallace design. A family game ruined by the usual insane multiple game end/win conditions that perhaps only worked once in Liberté. You are at the mercy of cards drawn and there is little to mitigate bad luck in draws.

On top of that, the one win condition based on filling the board with trouble markers seems problematic. It depends on all players working to keep the board clear of trouble, and if a player gets the city that allows regular trouble removal then they have to spend money to act as board cop, preventing that win condition for everyone else.

Finally, it's terrible with two players. It could possibly work if the trouble marker and the deck elimination wins are removed. The trouble player is pretty much insurmountable.

9/2011 

Martin Wallace is one of my favorite game designers, and I am delighted that he is publishing in new genres.  This is a light game with a few, simple rules.  I think players who love the books upon which this game is based, or games like Killer Bunnies, will enjoy this game.  You play a card, do what it says, and draw back up. Your win conditions are those of your secret character.  That is it. It is card driven, so there is a lot of luck involved, but there is some strategy, deduction, and bluffing, too.  Most of the fun comes from slamming others.  

I ordered deluxe version from Treefrog site which has wonderful wooden components, and the red dragon on the box. During pre-order, I fell in love with that magnificent red dragon, so was really surprised when all the cards were cartooney with garish colors, which I find unpleasant.

I don't enjoy this type of game very much--I like a more strategic game.  Of course, it didn't help that on the first game I played, that for over half the game I was reduced to 3, in-hand cards and never had a coin in front of me that wasn't taken before I could spend it.  My opponents died laughing, and it was pretty funny, but it also made a boring game.  It took and hour and I was unable to play anything for 40 of those minutes.

Hangulatos, könnyed befolyásszerzős játék. Azért nem elhanyagolható a szerencse szerepele, de a célkártyák, de az akciókártyáke esetén, van benne kicsit királycsinálós jelleg is, de mindezek simán tolerálhatóak egy 30 perces, szórakoztató játék esetén. A szabályok 10 percet alatt taníthatóak, egyedül a nyelvfüggő kártyák jelentenek némi akadályt a szélesebb közönség előtt. Simán megérne egy magyar kiadást.
--------
Nagyon jó ez a játék, de pár előfeltétel kell hozzá, hogy teljen fényében csilloghasson:
1. Fix 4 ember.
2. Olyan társaság, ahol mindenki alaposan ismeri a játékot.
3. Vimes kivétele.
4. Minden tanácsadás, dumálás megtiltása.

Na, ha ez mind adott, akkor ez egy 9.5-es játék. Ha nem, akkor 6-6.5 körül, attól függően, hogy mik hiányoznak. :)

RATING: 5
A fairly light and ultimately forgettable exercise in arbitrary chaos. The game obviously targets the family market more than the gamers, but even in that respect it feels a little off: While the cards quite lovingly depict scenes and charcters from the novels and tie in just fine the board play completely fails to create any sort of relation to the Discworld universe at all.

Wonderful art, a fun theme extremely well executed, easy to learn and teach, and quick. The secret objectives along with the mostly-steady build up of power make it very fun. This is my current favorite light game. 

I've taught this to several people as their first or second game. It is so elegant new players can easily get into the mind-games of figuring out who is who for the secret objectives.

A fast, simple Wallace game?  Who knew this was possible.  Mechanically very streamlined and easy to jump into.  The cards are funny and slightly disturbing.  The sheer amount of randomness fades with repeated plays.  This game reminds me a bit of Cosmic Encounter for some reason which might be why I like it so much.

Yet to be Played (20/11/10).  Updated: Would seem to be more for collection than playing - still unopened, and so rated 6 (17/9/11). Its chaotic, short and light; just not too sure if I would regularly play (the player objectives seem a strange mix for me, and the ability to buy a minion for $3 if you have a building on a certain area seems too powerful (10/6/12). UPDATE:  Im sure if i was a Pratchett fan i would like it more. Its an ok game, i would play if asked, but thats about it (Rating 6.867, March 2015)

As a big fan of the novels I was initially impressed with the way that the theme had been incorporated into the game.

However, after a few games I came to the reluctant conclusion that the game wasn't actually much fun. The cards do not offer much variety and the hidden victory conditions meant that I always seemed to be paying more attention to my opponents moves than thinking about my own

RATING: 7
After two games, with two players. I have the deluxe edition with the resin buildings and minions, and there is great joy in holding and playing these amazing pieces. (The wooden coins are not so great, but I use my own metal coins anyway.) The game is chaotic and zany--if you don't like randomness then stay away from this game. It is, however, full of flavor and humor. I suspect if I hadn't already read many Discworld books, and if I didn't have the deluxe components, I wouldn't be holding on to this game. Rating could go higher if the game plays better with more people. With 2 it feels a little lacking.

Update: Definitely much better with the full 4 player complement. I'll be avoiding this one for 2 players. The game is charming and something I would happily reach for if there were 4 of us and there were casual gamers involved.

RATING: 7.2
 You are one of the characters from Terry Pratchett's Discworld book series vying for control over the city of Ankh-Morpork.  There are seven lords to choose from.  Three have the same goal, while four have quite different ones.  You must complete your goal before your opponent finished theirs, and the only way to do this is by playing cards from a community deck.  
  This is a pretty fun game, though luck is very important.  It's fun to put down your little wooden agents, (I like to pretend they are thugs in a gang war) and have them cause havoc in Ankh-Morpork.  Much of the fun comes from the card's names and pictures, each represents a different character from the books.  What makes the cards even better is the effects usually agree with the character on the card.  My personal favorite is White Face, who is a mime who will follow you around unless you give him money.  
  The game is not perfect however.  As every action you take is determined by either the cards you play, or the buildings you own, luck is a pretty big factor in this game.  The cards are not of equal value.  Most cards allow you to do one or two unconnected things, while some are really powerful and allow you to do a combo from just playing it by itself.  Skill will help you make the most while you wait for these super cards.  Only when you get them do you feel like you can really make a move and piece together a combo.
  Despite the reliance on luck I think this is a pretty good way to pass an afternoon.  Do you have to know who most of these characters are?  Yeah, to get a kick out of playing cards you kind of do. This limits who you want to play it with a little.  People who don't know the characters will play it, but they will get board pretty quickly.
  Who do I think will get the most out of this game?  I think you need to have three things going for you.  You need to: 1) enjoy board games enough to spend $40 on one, 2)have read a few Discworld books and have enjoyed them, 3) don't really want a competitive game, then you really should get the game.  The last two will points probably go hand in hand, but I thought the distinction should be clear.  With that said, I don't think this game will sell very well.  Then again Martin Wallace is a pretty famous guy.

RATING: 7
Being an avid Pratchett fan, I had high hopes for [b][i]Discworld: Ankh-Morpork[/i][/b]. Unfortunately, this is not my ideal Discworld game because it feels very chaotic as you play. I suppose that fits the theme, but it doesn't translate super well to a game in my opinion. (On a side note, I'm pretty certain my ideal Discworld game would expand upon the game between Fate and the Lady that is played in The Colour of Magic and Interesting Times). I like it most as a 2-player game where the game's chaos is mitigated.

That said, Discworld: Ankh-Morpork is not a bad game. It's a quick-playing hectic encounter filled with memorable Discworld characters. It's essentially an area control game, and the hidden objectives add an interesting twist as to exactly what areas are best for you to control. Every game is fun, it's just that individual games are not as memorable as I would like.

Oh, the chaos. Still, my biggest complaint is the potential for downtime in this ultimately very frivolous game -- nothing is more dis-spiriting than watching others play three or four cards on a single turn and then spending mere seconds on one's own turn to simply put out a minion.

I really wanted to like this but after the first few plays left a little so-so.  Worker placement by cards - OK mechanism, hidden victory conditions, hmmm, all done well but nothing new.  Theme is pretty to look at, but if your test is, does it help explain the rules, well, not really. Cards are nicely tied in to their character, but only Discworld completists will know the many more obscure ones.

I really enjoy this and am happy to play at any time, but it is not without it's faults which prevent a higher score.
The biggest fault is after a play or two it's very easy to recognize who everyone has.  This game would go up a point if they add more personality cards.  I also would like it if there were more cards that trigger the special events and more events that place trolls and demons.  I am a huge fan of Discworld and love the references, a few of my friends are actually starting to read the books because if this game.  The rules are simple and work well, it is incredibly light, so don't expect any brain burn, and I think it would be fantastic with late elementary and middle school age kids.

The more I play this, the more I like it.  It's chaotic and cutthroat but there is enough nastiness to go around so no one is left out of the action. 

I know there is talk that some of the end game goals are better/harder than others but I have all the goals win.  It could be though that we are all still learning and that won't be the case after a few more games.

Not bad "entertaining" game. It's light, luck factor is important, but it plays quite nicely. Hidden identities, and some harrasment add some enjoyment. It's not so tragic as some people said, as long as you are not expecting a serious Wallace's game. The theme is really pasted on, so don't expect too much Disc World's atmosphere.

60 minute game, there is a board but gameplay is all about how you use your cards. Lots of nasty things to do to other players makes this a lot of fun :) You don't need to be a fan of the discworld books to enjoy this, but if you are you will get more out of it, for example why certain characters were selected to do certain activities.

So sad.  This was on the wishlist, and we were looking forward to it at Essen.  We waited for more then an hour to get a table, and try it out.  The game was horrible.  It is a really clunky worker placement/area control game where the theme is on the cards, and that is about it.  Other then Vines, there are no characters you WANT to be, and the sophomoric mechanics just weren't fun.

Deluxe Edition pieces are very nice, heavy and well sculpted. The game is pleasantly chaotic, easy to learn, encourages lots of trash talking laughter. About midway through the game (meaning, midway through the Draw deck) the tension and excitement ramp up as people are starting to get close to their secret victory condition. A great, fun game for 2, 3, or 4 players (in other words, it's worth playing with any number of people). With we could add a 5th player!

Ankh-Morpork, set in the largest city-state in Terry Pratchett's Discworld. Lord Vetinari has disappeared and different factions are trying to take control of the city. Each player has a secret personality with specific victory conditions, which means that you're not sure exactly what the other players need to do in order to win.

Great area control game. I haven't read the books and that wasn't a problem at all. I'm sure that familiarity with the universe would make it even more interesting. 

It is chaotic, but that didn't bother me. It was just the right amount of chaos. Maybe it's because I won, but I always felt like I was able to keep track of everything (barely). It was fun trying to figure out which winning condition the other players were working towards.

I've only played once, but it seems like trouble tokens are the easiest winning condition. It's much easier to disguise your intentions than with the other conditions. It's hard to hide that you're trying to collect money or gain area control.

The game has simple rules and enjoyable gameplay, but it is very chaotic and luck-driven, with plenty of take-that actions. The theme is a big plus for me, as I enjoy the "Discworld" books, but the cards should have some flavor text, because I suspect not even the most fanatic reader will know and remember all the characters.

The cards vary wildly in power, and although most seem useful, there is even one that does absolutely nothing. The secret goals (victory conditions) are even worse, completely unbalanced in difficulty. If everyone is paying attention, one seems impossible and a few are very hard to attain, while there is little or nothing that opponents can do to mess with two others. This eventually killed the game for me. I had fun playing and gave it a fair shake, but it became increasingly difficult to accept the flaws, once the novelty wore off.

RATING: 7
one of the 'simple rules', but a lot of possibilities during game play.  In general, there's a lot of chaos and random card draw.  But, if you plan a couple different things, I didn't feel completely out of control.  That being said it seems like it's one of the seesaw games where it will be hard getting to victory unless you somehow make a big push WAY past your victory conditions.  So, it seems it will go to 'game end' VPs.  There are 7 characters, one of them wins if it goes to 'game end' VPs without counting them.  I am worried that it will go there a lot and IF this character is in play, they will win and it might make the game feel anti-climatic a lot.  But, I did [b]rate it a 7[/b], we'll see how it plays out, but it might drop some over time.

Maybe it's because I didn't read the books, but this game didn't captivate me. There is a rehashing of old mechanics (El Grande's "play a card/take an action" and most standard issue area control games).

This is a 4 player game. It falls a little flat with 3 and isn't much of anything with 2. As a 4 player game though, it is a lovely light-to-medium mix of chaos, bluffing and tactical play.

Combines euro-style area majority mechanics with ameritrash style hidden victory conditions and variable player powers that are awarded based on control of certain areas.  Card driven system but hand management doesn't really play a big part.  Its also fast and through the flavor text on the cards manages to capture some ankh-morpork flavor.  I do worry that since the other three players can usually stop someone from obtaining a secret victory condition, once everyone is experienced, a disproportional number of games will be won by the character who wins when the deck runs out.  Not sure.  Will have to play a few more times to see.  I like the tightly designed area control theme and quick playing time so much I don't care.

I have only read one book of the source material, but I imagine that this game is a must-have for fans of the series. While each card has a different illustration and name, some have an identical function, so the appeal will come more from recognition of characters than real integration of theme.

Primarily an area control game, most of the actions are done through cards. The simple "play a card, then refill your hand" style works very well. With five cards in hand, many providing the ability to play multiple cards, it's generally pretty easy to accomplish something towards your goal on your turn. The real challenge is that you also need to worry about stopping other people from doing the same.

This is a beautifully illustrated game with excellent production quality (despite one unfortunately very confusing typo). It's very much a gateway game, though the it can be hard at first to prevent others from winning. This is probably the biggest drawback in my book. It is very difficult to watch out for several other people potentially achieving one of five different goals. That said, getting a different goal each game provides some fun variety. 

This seems like a game that doesn't really provide enough depth or variety to want to play it for years to come. Even so, it's enjoyable enough that I'd always be willing to play. That could change after a lot of plays though.

At first I was thrilled to see a designer game on this subject, because I am a Pratchett fan. Unfortunately the whacky chaos of Ankh-Morpork society doesn't translate into a good game.

I'm willing to play again because of the theme and mercifully short play time, but this is not a good game.

Despite it's chaotic elements, this is a pretty solid game.. there is a lot of luck, but at least you can try to mitigate that.
I like the bluffing about your secret winning condition. Everyone tries to keep others from winning, until there are just too many fires to handle. That way players can catch-up rather well.
The artwork & theme is a lot of fun & incorporates pretty good.
All in all a very pleasant game if you don't mind loosing due to bad luck.

I really enjoy this game. It's quite random, especially in a 2 player game, but the time investment is short (under an hour) and it's relatively simple to grasp. 

The game is about area-control and has a great deal of take-that. I don't always love take-that, but I enjoy it here. This is a game that evokes more laughter than deep thought and that's okay.

Great components, easy to learn. I especially love the card mechanic where you choose which abilities on each card to use. It really makes the game easy to learn.

Not bad... its fun but given that theres a lot to it, plenty of in game text and potential for good tactics I shall have to judge it as being a serious tactical game

The fact that players can pretty much work out who's who means that the stack seems to run out with any observant players. Emphasised by the fact that the discarded player cards can be viewed using action cards

On this basis the Vimes card which wins if the game ends that way is over powered

(05/2012) Comment based on one play.

I was very disappointed with this Martin Wallace design, as it was rather simplistic, chaotic, and seemingly random. You have a hand of cards, each with symbols that allow you take specific types of actions. If you're lucky, you may be able to string together multiple actions and gain good presence on the board. As for the board, we were left scratching our heads about what we were trying to accomplish on the board. Is it area-control? No, but you do want to get enough money to buy a building in a specific area to give you possibly recurring benefits.

Our game ended rather quickly at about 15-20 minutes with one player achieving his secret objective easily. The general feeling was "meh".

I don't know who Pratchett is, and the group was not familiar with his work, so the theme wasn't compelling and felt pasted on. There were some trademark Wallace mechanisms scattered here and there, but overall didn't feel like a Wallace game. My knee-jerk rating is a '3', with little patience to try this again.

I love the Discworld novels, and so love the theme of this.  I'd like more theme stuff though as while the art is fun on the cards it would be awesome to have a bit more.

This game is OK.

The first plays are very chaotic because you have to learn the card effects and character strategies in order to play properly. But the game is not bad.

You have to pretend to be a different character as the one you really have, in order to stealthly snatch the victory. This game is more about bluffing and negotiating than about area control or hand management.

However, it will get burned after a dozen plays. The only reason to keep it in your collection is to be a Discworld fan.

It's quick and pretty light, with lots of bluffing and an awful lot of Take That! None of these things are what I go to MW for, but he ties them together in a really well-themed, tight, and fun game.

Light and chaotic especially for a Wallace game but it works well. It does seem hard to hold on to your victory condition for a whole turn, but several games have proven that it is possible. The quirky theme and cards and hidden goals make this game a winner.

That said, you can get badly burnt by the cards and the experience can be extremely variable so I can see why some don't like it.

Super chaotic. This is a hidden-identity game in which players try to fulfill their objectives without the other players noticing. So it's probably worthwhile to feint and try to make ambiguous moves, but then again, the game isn't too long. Eventually, everyone will run out of cards that stop other players from winning, and someone will win, and you need to know that going in.  Still, I enjoyed it. Even without a really deep knowledge of the theme, this is silly fun. (1 play)

I really liked my one play of this. This may be an odd comparison, but it reminded me a bit of Bruges: Each turn you get ~5 crazy cards and make the best of them, with stuff on the board affecting what cards will work best when. And I liked Bruges well enough -- but this was so much more fun! I assume I'll grok the deduction element more with future plays.

RATING: 10
Brilliantly executed, great gameplay and is different enough each time to play frequently. I find new players pick it up quite quickly but it takes a while to master some of the characters. If you are a Pratchett geek, you will appreciate the subtleties of what each character card does which adds to the pleasure for me, but have played it with several people who have never picked up one of the books and they enjoy the game just as much for what it is as a game. The artwork is nice and the board layout good - my only suggested improvement would be to make the city 'areas' more defined as you do have to squint a bit.

I had the full rules explained and watched a complete game.

WOW!  This is not Wallace!  This is some counterfeit!

_Primitive_ mechanics and the game is all about _primitive_ bashing any player trying to fulfill his winning condition.  Nothing more in it.

_Primitive_ randomness added (like 'Roll a dice.  If >7, you gain 2 gold; if less, you lose 2 gold').

Not an ounce of innovation.  Anywhere.

Theme _totally_ pasted on.

RATING: 7
I happily bought this from its source, in Wincanton's Discworld Emporium, and play it at home as a 'family' game, though it sometimes gets played on more serious club nights too. I've been a fan of Terry Pratchett for a long time, and I've played other punishingly heavy Martin Wallace games too. However, this seems to appeal to people unfamiliar with the books' details who are also more used to the Monopoly - they find some of the cards funny and can build to get rent. An early lead seems possible by assassinating and role-appropriate building, but then it gets quite chancy in the later game. I'm looking forward to this getting much more play.

I have the collectors edition. I love the themeing! I love Terry Pratchett as an author and can happily get absorbed in the World of the Disc (The Turtle Moves!) I think these guys have done a nice job on this game. I find it really difficult to win as anyone other than Vimes (and have had other players say the same, have played with a few different groups) but the trying is fun! I would LOVE to have an expansion that included more characters and also allowed more players (though I imagine that would get crowded, I think it would be great chaos if the winning conditions were adjusted appropriately).

Initial Rating: 5.0

This is the worst Wallace game I have played so far, it is too light for a Wallace game, most people here on BGG say the game is very thematic which would be a huge plus for me if it were true, it is thematic (I guess)  if you have read the books, which I have not, maybe if I have I could have appreciated the game better, but for me this game doesn’t tell a story. At first glance it appeared a good game with interesting decisions, but as it has so much luck, so much chaos, your plan can and will come crashing around you. The victor is determined mostly by luck which I didn’t expect from Wallace and that is my main complaint with the game.

The game board and the art is beautiful, I  give you that, however in the Collector`s Edition there is a huge typo in the player aid, the character Vetinri (I believe) says he wins when there are between 7 and none trouble markers, it took a while to shed light in this and it is a minor concern, however as it was the collector´s edition I feel mistakes like this should have been caught.

I love secret role games but playing this I didn’t have much fun.

On the surface, this looks like a pretty basic area control game. It definitely has some hidden depths, though. The asymmetrical goals make for some very interesting in game deduction. The cards are fun and varied (and if you're a fan of the Discworld series, as my wife is, you will probably get very excited about all the familiar faces). The only sort-of negatives I see are that game's randomness can definitely screw a player over, and the fact that win conditions must be present at the start of your turn, which basically makes leader bashing a big part of the game. It may be possible to disguise who you are enough to sneak a win, though, we'll see. Good game, though, I'm glad I picked it up.

Martin Wallace continues his trend of creating lighter and lighter games. This is a fun title with great artwork and smooth game play. Martin used to be terrible at designing lighter games, but now he seems to have really grasped how to do it. I prefer the heavier games myself, but I think this has enough going on that I'll enjoy bringing it to the table. The player aids are excellent and the pieces for the Collector's Edition are very nice. Beautiful production. Enjoyable, lighter game.

It is the lightest Martin Wallace game I have played, but that still does not mean it's simple.

Wallace is hit or miss and this one is a miss. It's one of his lightest games which is not bad in itself. But I don't like the hidden player goals that might be all to easy or nigh impossible to achieve depending on how the game develops. The game itself is an exercise in randomness and player targeting while trying your best to hide your own goal and hopefully being able working toward achieving it. No need to play it again.

RATING: 6
Having now read the first 7 Discworld novels (I started reading because I bought this game on whim feeling guilty at a game store), I still don't get many of the references. You must either need to read them all, or just the books that were most recent when the game came out. Anyway, the game is very light. It has awesome art on the cards, but the game board is a muddy abomination. The actual gameplay has a tendency to feel imbalanced in favor of four of the seven secret roles (everyone assumes that you have on of the three that are the same). 

I never felt like my card playing mattered as much as I wanted it too. The presence of those cards that allow you to play other cards make the game luckier than I would like. Also, most events seemed like they very rarely would have a significant effect on the gameplay. Some events were nearly gamebreaking. In the game we played, the person who won achieved half of their trouble-marker goal when the event deck turned up the troll card. It made all the rest of the work we did feel severely pointless. 

I still want to give it another go, but I'm not feeling terribly impressed.

I've got to admit, not the best game ever. However, I'm a massive Pratchett fan and will be keeping this game simply on that account. This one doesn't make it to the table very often, but I will play it from time to time.

A nice experience with changing goals and arguing with friends about what to do so that someone might not win. Random events bring a nice touch of unpredictability to the game.

4 players might be a bit few, but considering the elements of the game, i doubt it would work with more than 5.

RATING: 5
Card-driven area majority game that seems at least somewhat original and thematic, but also quite unbalanced if not broken in the random hidden victory conditions. All Chrysoprase has to do is hope everyone is rational enough not to allow a victory on the board; all Vimes can do is pray no one is playing Chrysoprase.

I found the implementation of the theme very weak, and I'm a forgiving, diehard Discworld fan. In this game, like in Lords of Waterdeep a bit, you don't know your opponents' roles, which can be critical in the endgame plans. Not much humor in the game either, which is vital for a true Discworld experience.

RATING: 5
Definitely not my thing. A-M suffers from major screwage and a bit of runaway leader-itis - if you can get a building earlier than anyone else, the game is probably yours; it's yours if you get a really good combo; it's yours if people fail to attack you when you're ahead. Not sure how much I can get behind a game that feels this arbitrary.

What it boils down to is, in order to feel reassured that the winner isn't random, I'd need to play a lot of it with the same people, and that's never going to happen when El Grande is out there scratching the same itch but doing it in a much more finely articulated way.

Fantastic production, though - absolutely top-notch.

The worst game I have played in 2011, and by quite a wide margin. I really dont see the attraction in this other than the theme appeals to some people. Did I miss something, was all the interesting stuff happening to other people while I was just flopping the only uninteresting cards in the game ??  

Two of the four people had played before, so the rules weren't being played wrong. I think this is just one of those games I dont click with and for me rates as poor at best. I was tempted to give it a lower score, but felt based on one play that would have been harsh. 

The only saving grace I can fond for this game is the presentation is good. That brings it up to 4 from a lower score.

Great area control game with many hidden identities and different goals for winning (the only minus... threee lords with the same victory condition). Each winning condition seems to be both easy and difficult. The main goal of the game is to stay hidden for as long as possible before you finally declare that you won which sometimes is really hard because it mostly depends on the cards that you get. All in all, a great game in which you try to guess who is who and not to tell too fast who you are yourself.

This seems much more enjoyable with 3 players rather than 4.  With 4 the chances of your winning state surviving the plays of the other 3 players seems pretty minimal so Vimes always wins at the end of the maximum-length play time.  With 3 players there's a better chance to hide, or 'run' a victory condition robust enough to still be there when the turn gets back to you.

A tactical area control game where your hand of cards dictates the available actions.  While it might seem like a rather rigid approach that would sap away fun, it instead forces you to carefully manage your options.  Can you still get hosed by a series of bad card draws?  Sure, but that is easily downplayed by the game's length.

Played a demo copy at Kubla Con over Memorial Day.  Really enjoyed the creative, area-control mechanics.  There were some nice thematic elements to the game, although I'm not familiar with the novels.  With each player having a different, secret winning condition, there's a meta-game that lays over the mechanics as you try to infer what your opponents' winning conditions are and try to disguise your own.  Given that your winning condition must be met at the *start* of your turn, disguising it becomes paramount.  In my case, I had to try to over-achieve my winning condition so that my opponents couldn't reduce my position during their turns.  Didn't work :(

Good game. falls to the old problem of everyone simply stopping each other from winning until, finally, one person sneaks through. As such the ending feels a little 'flat', rather than feeling like you have won everyone else just feels like they have failed to stop you.... but still fun and QUICK.

BBG Secret Santa 2014 gift.

If you read the rulebook the first time, you'd never think this would be an interesting, deep game. But it is though.
The core mechanics are so simple (play card, do what it says; add troublemarker when a dude moves in, remove when a dude moves out), but they work together so well. It's a lot of fun seeing plans come together or drown in the blink of an eye in the murky waters of the Ankh.

I'm a big Pratchett fan. I really wanted to love this game. I like it but I don't love it and I don't think my group is particularly keen on it. At first glance the mechanics look great but I think that where the problem lies is in the anticlimactic ending. We have played maybe 4 times so far and each time, as far as I can recall, the game has ended by someone saying 'oh, I win' and the others studying the board and their hidden card for a moment before saying 'oh yes, well done'. I don't know how that could be fixed but it definitely drags what could have been a great game down a peg or two.

Decent worker-placement and secret information game. I've read all of pratchett's books, but the game itself wasn't for me. I would rather have had more of a discworld adventure game than this euro-type. It is what it is, and isn't bad, but wasn't to my taste. Try before you buy.

This is likely the least strategic and is the easiest Wallace board game to pick up and play but I find it very entertaining to play as long as the people get into the spirit of things and don't mind nasty play.  This is NOT your typical, gamers' game that Wallace for which he is known.  

LIKE:

* Cards have symbols at the top indicating which actions you can take in that specific order.  Outside of the event card icon, you can choose to skip an action(s).  
* The different instant win conditions each person has creates fairly aggressive game play in which people are constantly hammering on others in the game.  If you don't like mean games, stay FAR away from this one.
* Hey, the "7a" on the die instead of the "8" is a nice, thematic touch!  :-)
* This game is very simple to teach and play.  
* The special extra actions one can take from building in a region is a nice touch as well.

DISLIKE:

* First games may drag slightly as people figure out the cards and how to chain some together effectively.

This game shines when you want a game that's quick to pick up and play. The theme is a bit slapped on, which is a shame because I love the setting and a game that blends the setting with the mechanics would probably been a 10, but it is a fun fast game that everyone can get into easily. It's very balanced and the secret personas will have everyone questioning everyone else's motives!

Mechanically very simple.  Just play a card from your hand each turn and draw up to 5 if you don't already have 5.  The meat of the game is in the hidden victory conditions for each player.  It took us a while to figure out the rules with the troublemaker tokens.  And how easy it could be to get a majority in 4 places if unchecked.  Good chaotic fun, which I suppose is in keeping with the theme of the books (which i haven't read.)

Not a bad game really. Its fast, fun and chaotic making every move potentially eyebrow raising; whether or not the player is trying to win the game or just hiding his agenda. It could be a little unfair for some players depending on the luck of the draw and certain take that mechanics, but I guess the game is short enough to warrant another game for potential payback. Either way, it is a fun and entertaining game, and the limited edition is definitely very beautiful.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
It's a real chaos which does reflect the books and universe. However, despite much efforts this can also create serious imbalances.
The fact that three out of seven characters have the same objectives in a 4+ game is also a real drawback IMHO, and a lack of creativity (esp. considered the universe), often resulting in stuck/imbalanced games.
At the end of the day, the game starts really slowly and only starts to be enjoyable after a good 20/30 mins run. However, it's only enjoybale  for a couple of turns until the imbalances really kicks in.
Whilst the cards are nice and all different, this also means you will be spending an awful lot of time with you, yourself, and your hand, and when you play them, no one really cares or pays attention at the artwork, and only looks at the result, because everyone wants the game to move on...

To sum up, a good concept that however suffers from serious game flaws (imbalances, time, etc.) and that do not exploit the universe enough, leaving me with an unpleasant aftertaste.

Now, I don't like area control games. I prefer my opponents not see their eminent defeat until it happens. My favorite games are ones where I'm comfortably sitting in 2nd place until the last few turns. That's hard with area control games (though I managed it in that french revolution one).

Rating of 7.3 after having played it a second time, with four people. First play, with two, was terrible and I will probably never do that again. This game has a lot of randomness, but the fun comes from guessing who has what victory condition. Great looking game (collectors edition) that plays fast and makes my group want to read the books. Overall I like my games a bit heavier, but in my collection it has its' place.

An area control, area majority game where each player has a different goal.  You try to cover up your goal as best you can throughout the game and not let other players discover it.

10/2011 If you've read the Pratchett Discworld books some fond memories will return. If not the theme will fall flat.  The game itself is simple; players receive a secret objective (there's 5 different to choose from), then play action cards in order to reach ones goal.  Take it or leave it - can be a laugh with the right group.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
It feels as though being familiar with the Discworld novels would add considerable value to the game. The cards are all unique and each features different characters from the series, but unfortunately, you don't get much of a sense of what the Discworld theme is all about from this game alone. That's a pity, because there's a bit of chaos in this game that, presumably, would be more excusable if one understood how it was justified by the theme.

That having been said, this is by no means a bad game. It's a solid and accessible area-control game with sound mechanics, and it is definitely a game for those who are already in the hobby (or just getting into the hobby). It's just that those who know and love the source material will get considerably more enjoyment out of this.

Hidden victory conditions are difficult to do well, and when coupled with some or a lot of Take That gameplay, tend to have heavy kingmaking issues. Although I’m not sure about its long-term prospects, this nicely illustrated discworld game at least was fun enough the first time through, and I’d recommend trying it at least once for every Pratchett fan.

This is especially true as the abilities of the various characters that crop up are well connected to their role in the books - beggars beg, thieves steal, and clowns are aggressively useless - which I enjoyed a lot even though I played a german version with (to me) unfamiliar and only occasionally sensible translations of the original.

action and  mischief in an excellent boardgame (a little Diskworld knowledge is advicable :-) )

I particularly like the special edition board which is extra large. Very nicely illustrated, and I like the hidden role aspect. Always leaves me wanting another game.

Area control game, dice rolling, hand management, variable player powers.

Love the game.

First of all, the game is very easy to pick up - new players can start playing after a five minute explanation of the rules. 

What is more, its just incredibly fun! The backstabbing players, the random disasters can all turn your plans to dust in a matter of seconds, still all youre thinking of is how to decieve others and come out on top.

Its also looks great, the cards have awesome pictures., the board is really nice, and everything is just dripping with humor, if you know and like the Discworld series.

The game has some minor issues, like Vimes winning a bit too often when playing with 4 players, but this doesnt reduce the fun we are having with every match. Played this game over 15 times, and I plan to play a lot more!

(11/17) 7. Finally got a chance to play this grail game.  It's a very interesting card driven area control/majority game that is particularly interesting for its variable win states based on which player you draw.  That said, there was a lot of bash-the-leader and maybe a little too much dependent on card draws?

I debated whether or not to buy this for a long time, and eventually decided that loving Discworld, enjoying Martin Wallace, and the prevailing opinion that while it's chaotic and generally not the kind of gaming I'd go for, it's short enough that it doesn't outstay its welcome made it a worthwhile chance to take.

Based on one play, I should have trusted my gut. It's beautiful, from the board to the cards, and it's fun to see how Discworld characters are translated into its mechanics. But on the first play I did nothing wrong, got hosed early on, and spent the rest of the game playing no meaningful role and doing nothing fun -- and there was no way for me to change that.

When a game with that potential is short, I'm usually okay with it; this dragged AND wasn't fun. Sold despite loving the theme.

Perfect. Does not end too early and does not drag on for too long.

balance: 6/10
Not very balanced, The Dragon Knight is too OP, Vetinary and the 3 Lords are too easy to counter once revealed, Vimes is too dependent on his opponents skills. Chrysoprast id too luck dependent.

*Collector's Edition:

This game is a lot meatier than I anticipated--so much going on. The massive card deck should offer great replay value. After two plays, I feel that I've only scratched the surface. Color me surprised. I expected this to be a simple hidden character role game with a little area control sprinkled in. yet, unexpectedly, this game has a lot more to offer. Does that make it better? Not necessarily. There's certainly more to chew on, but it also forces you to compare this to other light-medium weight games. In that category, Discworld loses points. In short, I really like this game, and I hope my rating will improve with time.

Update 12/3/14:

I played last night with Erin, after almost a year without playing. I forgot how fun this game is. We definitely played it wrong our first 2 games (we didn't do the setup in the three initial districts). Because of the rules misread, we were running through the whole deck without meeting character-ending conditions. After playing the right way, we never made it to the brown deck. At 30 minutes, this game is awesome. At 90 minutes, it's still really solid, but a little long for what it is. Nevertheless, after experiencing the shorter game twice in a row, I have to increase my rating of the game. Part of the reason I played it was to see if I wanted to keep it. I'm not getting rid of this one for a while!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
If you love the Discworld books, you will love this game!  Otherwise, the game will probably not be for you, as there will be too many inside jokes on the cards.

The two card decks with weaker ones drawn first is very useful at evening out the luck aspect of the game, though there is still a lot of luck in the game.  If the game was less luck based, it would get a 10 from me.

It's ok, but nothing special. It's not that I mind the chaos, because the game is quick enough. It's more that it's just a bit bland. I expected more whacky fun in Ankh-Morpork. Even a little flavour text might have helped me enjoy the game more.

RATING: 7
I am a fan of the Discworld series, so the theme greatly appeals to me.

What I like:
- Humorous and fun if you play it lightly
- Random events can be pretty hilarious because of the destruction it leaves behind
- Different phases of the deck brings more tension and chaos to the second half of the game
- Hidden roles provide opportunities for role bluffing, and also provide some variation
- I think the 3 player game is best because there's less downtime and it feels like it's harder to stop other players compared to a 4 player game.  There seems to be a good balance between games ending where players meet their win conditions and when the deck runs out.

What I don't like:
- It is too chaotic and random if you try to play it competitively
- The Lords roles are a little boring
- It seems too easy for Vimes to win in a 4-player game, and too hard in a 2-player game

RATING: 8
A fascinating frenzy of fantastic features come together to create the chaotic Discworld: Ankh-Morpork.  In this game players get a secret identity, each of which has their own agenda that must be completed to win.

The game has a heavy area control component with lots of cards that can be played to allow for different things to happen on the board.  Each card in your hand will have one or more symbols along the top.  You must play the symbols in order from left to right, but you don't have to play the ones you don't want to!  The exception to this is the random event, which must be played.  The random events do mix things up quite a bit in an already pretty random game.

The cards have very funny art and names which will entertain you as you play.  So, if you don't mind chaos and silliness in your game you really should give this one a try.  I love this game.  The components are nice, and trying to figure out what the other players' goals are, and throwing a wrench in their plans is fun.  I highly recommend.

RATING: 7
Do you like Terry Pratchett? If the answer is no, this game probably isn't for you. Try before you buy at the very least. If it's yes or used to, read on. This game is really one for Discworld fans. Remove the theme: what remains is decent middleweight area control game with lots of chaos and nice components. I loved Discworld as a teenager and would've loved this game 15 years ago but now the theme isn't enough. It's ok game every now and then. Just not enough.. I like the secret objectives though, and at its best there truly will be Ankh-Morpork chaos on your table.

My review: http://manualgamer.com/discworld-board-game/

Great game.  Enjoy the deck draw mechanic, the hidden roles (which are much more varied than in Lords of Waterdeep), the battling for control on the map.

Interesting random element which adds a chaotic level of fun.

Can't think of anything I don't like about this game, other than it can be agonisingly frustrating when one's plans go awry.  I expect it could easily be introduced as a post gateway game.

I bought this purely because I liked the theme.  The Game itself was pretty random.  The first time through nobody really knows what's going on.  You get better as You recognize the cards more.  My favourite part is that the win conditions change.  The board wasn't as great as I hoped, but the components are nice.  The Game is only balanced over numerous plays, as everyone will have some luck fall on them over time.  Otherwise, an individual game on it's own does not evenly distribute advantage to each player; Maybe that's part of the appeal.  The rules are fairly easy to learn, and whoever starts to "get-it" first, can help other players out with their cards (learning and understanding win conditions and card symbols is necessary, luckily the symbols make sense with what they do, unfortunately, the cards pictures do not)  I recommend this for people who are already fans of Terry Pratchett and have read at least a few of his books.

Cards are too different and random, the Player is absolutely dependent on them, and his choices of actions are obvious - I feel like the game just runs itself saying me what to do.

If you love Discworld the theme will carry the game for you.  If you don't then it's not so clear-cut that you'll enjoy the game.  The characters' abilities are very thematic, and the events can be chaotic which is also thematic.  Hidden roles and their asymmetric win conditions are thematic as well and are different enough to make for very different strategies depending on which role you get.

Chaotic, light, silly area control game. Balance is best with the group is willing to reign in the leader, and are good at hiding or bluffing what their win condition is while trying to discern others.

Played a proto-type at Cancon 2011.

Pratchett fans of the Discworld universe will love this. Even if you're not a fan of Discworld (I'm not), the game is still quite engaging, very much card driven, but without that need to "churn through cards". All cards will are able to do something everytime your turn comes up & the balance seems pretty good for each card as well. The secret victory conditions for each player keep it tense, needing to know what the conditions are & then trying to ensure that only yours is met, it makes for a good game.

Looking forward to the finished article.

Nice looking, relatively simple area control game which incorporates Discworld well.  I like it very much.  It doesn't bog down in the boring, dry analysis that some area control games can do, so it doesn't feel like just area control.  My wife likes it quite a bit as well since it feels quick and light.

RATING: 7.8
Played (and won!) a late prototype with 'final' wooden playing pieces, but no card artwork yet. (april '11)

Play was promising. Quite a lot of interaction, as usual with a Wallace game. I like the (guessing of) the various roles with different win conditions. There is definitely a luck factor with the disaster cards going on, but nothing too extreme.

The demons and trolls should get a more prominent role though, they never got in the game. (And we all wondered if it would have mattered at all.

Rating is for prototype version, will be upgraded if the 'neutral player parts' get a better role.

Update: bought the collectors edition. Plays good and still pretty fast with 4.

RATING: 6
I'm a fan of the late Sir Terry Pratchett's Discworld, but I'd say this game works regardless of theme (though it does fit, and the cards are amusing even if only for the artwork and familiar names).

It's an interesting blend of what is a rather simple area control game and a simple card-play mechanism that drives it (play a card, do the action(s), draw back to five). It works because it is not the sort of game where you try to build incremental advantage, maximizing your points per turn. Instead it's a game of bluffing and illusions, feinting to the left while going right. Because every player has a hidden goal, which tells them the the only way that they can win the game. However, if you just mindlessly work towards that goal you find that it's rather easy for the other players to stop your progress cold if they know what you are after - so you have to bluff and feint your way to victory (sculpting the perfect hand, forcing the perfect sequence where you win because your opponents are stretched too thin and can't stop it because they saw it too late).

Quite random, with the cards, and even moreso with the chaos events, but that is alright by me, I still feel clever when I win - or see where I went wrong when someone else does. It rarely feels unfair in that someone is just handed their win due to luck of the draw. The one complaint about this game, that the Vimes role is broken, well I'll just repeat what the defenders of the role say, stop doing his job for him. If everyone is mindlessly blundering towards their own goal, just don't be the one to waste effort on stopping them, just try to race instead. It is not a game of perfect information, people will make mistakes and prioritize the wrong threats and that's when you have to be in position to strike.

A good game!

A quick-playing luck-filled area control game. Great fun as it doesn't take itself too seriously and it doesn't feel too bad getting kicked out of territories as it's usually a 1 for 1 trade.

Since the players have secret goals it's always tense and can end with a surprise.

Wallace goes light this time with a thematic majorities game where everybody has secret winning conditions.  I enjoy it although it's quite chaotic at times in both how the cards play out and why somebody chooses to attack another. You can try to guess what winning conditions your opponents have but at the end we're usually bashing anyone that's close to possibly winning. From what I've seen the end (when a victory condition is achieved) usually comes with a groan from everybody else.  

For me one of the biggest disappointments is that it's pretty difficult to bluff because the winning conditions require you to be very strong in one aspect of the game -- something that usually takes quite awhile to build up to. If you mess around trying to fool your opponents you'll probably lose.

Ook! (Exclamation of excitement and/or surprise). I was very pleasantly surprised by this game, not expecting too much from a literary-inspired board game. The game is very easy game to learn and has decent replayability with different characters from the novels and variable victory conditions.

You do not need complete knowledge of the Discworld universe in order to have fun playing this one, but having read a book or twenty in the series with definitely add to one's enjoyment of the game.

This is just a great game that plays out smoothly and keeps one involved when it's not your turn as you'll try to figure out your competitors' strategies.

Any game by Martin Wallace is worth a try so on reputation alone I was drawn to give it a try. I've played many of his more involved and complex euro style games and through them earnt respect for well crafted design. For entry level gamers it's ideal though balance for the game is probably questionable. The game can be won on victory points or by success in a secret mission. The game ends very quickly after starting so not much room existsto develop much of an engine to help with your character development. I might be tempted to give it another try, though for the moment, I'm not itching to play it again.

Big Discworld fan (mostly Watch, then Reaper Man and some Witches, the things like Monstrous Regiment, Going Postal, etc.). That, and some good reviews made me pick it up, and I'm glad I did. My wife and I play and enjoy it, though we don't bring it out as much as we used to anymore. It's relatively straightforward, though I remember a few tricky bits that made us search the internet or kinda "house rule" something. That said, we were newer to tabletop games of the sort at the time and maybe just didn't get something. :)

Lots of flavour, short, potentially very different hidden objectives, and a big degree of randomness. If you don't pay careful attention in the midgame, someone will sneak a win.  This feels more like an old EON design than a modern Eurogame, but in a good way!

Not your typical Wallace, it's a chaotic card game/area control game with simple rules and hidden win conditions. Pretty fun, as you need to figure out what your opponents are trying to do while hiding what you are trying to do.

RATING: 8
Nagyon jó és egyszerű játék! A szabályokat hamar meg lehet tanulni, és külön előny, hogy a kártyán sincsenek túlnyomó többségben az angol szövegek, inkább az ikonok dominálnak.

Szeretem, hogy maga a játék nem több, mint egy óra, de van, hogy fél óra az egész. Ez nyilván azért lehetséges, mert nagy szerepe van a randomnak, gyakorilatilag minden kártyát random húzunk. Viszont ez nem von le itt semmit az értékéből, mert ez egy FUN játék! A random teljesen a helyén van.

Egyetlen negatívumot emelnék ki: a personality kártyák között sok az átfedés, igazán kitalálhattak volna több félé-t, mert így ez tényleg kevés.

I feel that this game captures the feeling and atmosphere of the Discworld series better than the other 2 Discworld games I have played.  I love that everyone has  a different win condition, and a lot of the fun comes from figuring out what your opponents are trying to do while fulfilling your own condition.

Bought it for the good ratings and the whole Discworld theme. Didn't disappoint. I've only clocked in 5 sessions with two players, but both me (avid gamer and huge Discworld fan) and my girlfriend (only likes a couple of games and hasn't read any of the books) enjoyed it immensely. Rating is based on this, but soon I'll get to try it with 3 and 4 players. And I don't expect my rating to go down. Great fun!

RATING: 8
Decent area control with secret objectives and a lot of Discworld flavor including high-quality art.  I don't see it lasting long under repeat play, but it'll be fun to bring out for Discworld fans once in a while.

RATING: 6.5
It stroke me quite as a surprise, that a game created in spirit of an exisiting fictional world - is actually good even game-wise.
This is a fun game that spot on finds the balance between decisions (to keep it interesting) and randomness (to keep it replayable). While it might be interesting even for non-fans of the books, it's a must for any gamer+Pratchett fan, such as myself.

EDIT: After few plays, struck down to 6.5 . I thought we just can't play it properly, but it proves very much luck-driven.

A great mission based area controlling game using a deck of cards to perform actions.
The Discworld universe has been implemented very well onto a solid game.  All the cards and components are of high quality, so it looks the biz!
Requires playing with people of equal skill and its better if they've played a few times before.

RATING: 6
Ankh-Morpork is a high screw, high chaos, low complexity area control game with a Discworld series theme.

There's very little you can do to maintain any control in this game, as any movment towards a possible victory condition is almost always lost beneath a sea of screw actions between each of your turns from the other players!

Amusingly all players must still pay close attention at all times to each characters actions though, as it IS possible to win within a couple of turns if left unmolested!

The easiest way to win is to draw the Captain Vimes winning condition, which is simply to stop anyone else from winning until the action deck runs dry (which will usually be the outcome with a competative group).

Fans of the book series will enjoy spotting all the character references as an additional extra, but its not necessary to know the series to enjoy the game.

Ultimately a light experience which should not be taken too seriously, Ankh-Morpork is a good gateway game for non-gamers.

Rating and comment based on the prototype game version. First play was quick and interesting with plenty of interaction between the players using the card powers. Second play started similarly but changed half way through to stopping other players winning once the victory conditions for each player became obvious.

RATING: 7.5
Wallace goes light and uses the world of Terry Pratchett to create a great game. This game is all about the 'take that' factor as the players try to scrabble their way to the top of Ankh-Morpork whilst trying to keep their identity and win condition hidden for as long as possible. 

The game is card driven and a series of icons keep the game flowing very smoothly. Players can enjoy the game without being Discworld fans but it does add a little spice and excitement when the players know the characters in question.

Fans of heavy Wallace should not look here...this is a light family/gateway game for sure.

Half the fun is in accusing other players of being a certain character and trying to throw off people's suspicions as to who you are. As such this game is all about the group playing it.

RATING: 7
2-4 players.  60 minutes. This is a good, light game with some strategy, but also occasional crazy random swings.  There are some pretty hilarious situations sometimes.  I was worried the game would only be fun for fans of the Discworld books, but it turns out there's actually a good game in there.  Emily owns it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Very chaotic, direct player conflict. Impressively thematic, any experience of the Discworld universe increases your enjoyment of this game immensely. Players uninitiated with Pratchett's novels just tend to look confused as their fellow players giggle at almost every card.

RATING: 6
Sort of feels like the Lords of Waterdeep of area control games. It's very simple, but almost to the point of being able to play on autopilot. At the same time, I think fans of the source material will really enjoy this. There was just a little too much junk rattling around and not enough control for me to want to hang onto this over others in the same genre. Especially since the board feels so wide open that there isn't much tension on who will control what.

RATING: 4
Draw and play cards to move around dudes on a map until someone's secret victory conditions has been reached. While I appreciate the attempt to bring the Discworld to a board game and see the potential to constantly thwart your opponents plans, the gameplay itself seems too random and repetitive in the long run.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Easy to learn, fast to play, and I love the hidden roles everyone has.  My favorite part of the game is definitely looking at the actions of the other players and trying to figure out what they are working towards.  Everyone tries to team up on the player who might be winning, while also trying to screw everyone else over and advance their own agendas.  As an added bonus, the artwork in the game really makes me want to read more of the Discworld books!

EDIT: Owned by a family member, so I don't think I need to hold on to my copy anymore.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Intriguing and involving game, whether or not you know the citizens of Ankh-Morpork.  Shares some mechanics with the same designer's London, but with an endearing dose of randomness which means that routes to victory can suddenly change.  Hidden victory conditions make for a tense game, as does having to wait until your go to claim that victory.

I've not read any of Terry Pratchett's books so a lot of the references are lost on me. That being said I still enjoy the game. It works better with people that have played a few times. There different roles have different victory conditions but there aren't many of them. So with players familiar with the game you get a new element of strategy trying to determine which victory condition other players are aiming for while bluffing which one you're aiming for.

Haven't ever really played in the right group for this: it's very light, but probably needs repeated play for people to get down how much they have to push their own objective vs. stopping others (witness the large number of "Vimes is OP" complaints...)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fun game with a lot of deviousness. Have only played it with 2 players. Unfortunately Discworld seems to be let down by an unbalanced system that could do with a revision by the makers. Some of the character roles are exactly the same as each other and others are just too hard to beat or too easy to beat & its quite easy to figure out who the characters are. Once you figure them its almost impossible for the other player to win if they have one of the 4 area control players. It just needs the card deck balancing out with some extra assassination/less minion placement cards along with some character win roles and this game would be excellent rather than just good.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Delightfully interactive, aided immensely with cards evoking the theme of Pratchett's books.  "The Peeled Nuts" is a card that does nothing, which aptly summarises the lengths this game will go to for theme.

I have read every one of Terry Pratchett's Discworld books and this game takes the city of Ankh-Morpork to new depths. We play as a group. Myself, my fourteen-year-old cynic and my ten-year-old whose Machiavellian instinct caused him to win the first three games outright.  Although he is named Seán, we nearly called him Damien but could find only two sixes on his head.

Brilliant game.

Area control game with a twist. Each player has a secret winning objective. Beautiful board and card artwork. First few games have been pretty good, even if I have been beaten every single time.

In a time where I am leaning towards shorter games that still have tactical decisions I found this game refreshing, fun, quick, and cut-throat.

Each player gets dealt a card in the beginning telling them their secret winning condition.  Each player is chasing their own goals but with tight tuning everyone will already be stepping on eachothers toes.  With area control and clever card play that allows for fun combos, the game is right up my alley.

The theme is great, the production quality is awesome, but the game-play is so-so for us. For those who like cutthroat games, this game is pretty cutthroat.

REALLY enjoyed my first play of this: a terrific blend of area control, variable victory conditions kept in secret, and card management. All wrapped up in a gamer-friendly theme with terrific art, even in the prototype. Once I get my hands on the Collectors Edition - as I surely will - this may well become a 10.

Further Thoughts: Perhaps unsurprisingly, this has slipped a little, but remains a far better game than people give it credit for.

Further, Further Thoughts: I still adore the artwork, but the biggest gripe I have with the game now is that unless all four players are well experienced with the game, it becomes a non-event. Dropped right down to a 6.

Ankh-Morpork is wonderful for fans of Terry Pratchett. Fans of Martin Wallace' deeper games may find it lacks complexity, however, and should probably try before they buy. 

The board shows a map of Ankh-Morpork; players have a hand of cards, and in turn they play a card for its effect then redraw. The cards feature great art and strongly integrate the theme. Some cards let you place extra workers, play extra cards, upset your opponents... Gameplay is all about achieving a set of secret victory conditions and announcing success at the start of a new turn. Play is mainly tactical, with only a little opportunity to plan ahead. There is a lot of "swat the leader".

Ankh-Morpork is light, tactical, needs to be played fast and should be a pleasant 45 minute experience. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
If you're familiar the Discworld series, you'll love this game. The cards are beautifully rendered, the pieces are fairly high quality, and the game mechanics invoke all the random chaos of Ankh-Morpork. The cards feature beloved characters, as do the hidden roles.

As a bonus, apparently those who have no knowledge of the Discworld series also find it enjoyable - though I imagine it's not quite as much fun.

RATING: 5
Easy and nice game which mimics a town of Discworld setting. Probably knowing the setting can raise the my rating.
The game is essentially a card game, with a map on which you drop minions to control areas. It works smoothly and is fun. It has the very good idea of semi-secret individual objectives, which avoid the all-agains-one effect. However, 3 problems:
1) card drawing is really really random. Drawing many cards with the symbol "play another" makes your hand too pawerful
2) events are really chaotic, what you put on the board can easily disappear
3) houses are WORTHLESS. Unless you have the house which protects other houses, owning any house is a waste of money
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Played a pre-release copy at games day in Cardiff.  I was pleasantly suprised by this.  It wasn't on my radar at all but I joined in on a game and had a blast.  Plays quick (our game was less than 90 mins) and there's plenty of player interaction.  The artwork on the cards is very nice.  Might well get this when it comes out.

EDIT: after getting a couple more games of this under my belt I've lowered my rating a bit.  It's a decent game but perhaps a little too simple and after only three games of it now I'm feeling myself getting tired of it.

RATING: 5
I'm probably that type of player who SHOULD like the game, but I don't. It's not the hilarious and chaotic take-that!-game one might expect. Overall, D:AM is a rather boring game with little tension and little dynamics. It's too repetitive, uninspired and - that's my main objection! - often over with a sudden death before tension can build itself up. I also don't really feel the theme, which could have safed two scoring points in my book.

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]I got to play Jack's limited edition copy which was really nice. For starters I love area control games so I was pretty sure going into it I was going to like Discworld. What I didn't realize was just how chaotic the game was going to be, that said I had a blast. The game is easy to pick up and play, there really isn't much rules overhead and the game had a great player aid. Discworld is also the perfect length for the experience it delivers, our game wrapped up in about 45 minutes. 

I was playing with a full four players and our group was quite raucous which I think is a must for this game. Discworld would suffer if you played with a quiet/serious group, play with a bunch of cutthroat S.O.B.s and your in for a good time. Definitely a game I'm looking forward to playing again.[/i]

Despite my score, with the right group this game experience is a 10, esp if you are all fans of Pratchett.  The art and references are amazing.

The game is a bit random though, more so unsurprisingly when the wizards start showing up more often.  The game can also end very abruptly - and depending on the circumstance that can be unsatisfying.

It is worth playing though - especially if you like games of deception.  There is a lot of open space for meta-games!

This is fun when you're winning, experiencing Martin Wallace blend Euro into a thematic ride. But when you're the victim of horrible and out-of-proportion randomly hit losses which knock you out the game, not so much fun. Probably very thematic, but not satisfying. The back theme is that the ruler of Ankh-Morpork has disappeared and each player is one of the factions trying to take over the city in their own style. As such, each player has a secret mission, which may be controlling x of the 18 districts on the board, getting 50 money, getting x trouble markers out onto the board, getting minions into x districts, or simply making sure no one completes their secret mission before the deck runs out. So an essential part of the game is a wary watchfulness over what everyone does. Your own turn is to play cards out of your hands to affect what's going on around the board. Cards combine text actions and icons, which may be to build buildings, earn / steal money, place / move minions, trigger god-like disaster events from the event deck, play another card from your hand and so on. Each card's usefulness and actions are thematically linked to characters / places in the book(s) so readers should enjoy it. For gamers, it's a combination of building up your presence on the board with some hitty on other players. It comes in on the hour which is ok. The decisions on which card or cards to play, how and who to impact, without giving away your secret mission, and occasionally ganging up to hinder other players from what you think they might be doing, is the essence of the game. Given the forced end-game time clock of the draw pile running out (which may be someone's secret mission in itself, they're not all in each game), there can't afford to be too much ganging up - you've also got to focus on getting your own goal done in time. If no one gets their secret mission, there's a VP adding up thing at the end based on resources deployed. Turns are fast as the cards are easy to play out. There's not a huge amount of tension because all of what you can do is dictated by the 5 cards you have. And that's about it. Play for the theme.

For a Discworld fan this game makes so much sense and gives you most of what you would expect. Riots, floods and random monster incursions are the back drop for a setady stream of creat characters allowing you to do all kinds of intersting things to win the game. As always the wizards are the game stealer but a very well produced game that will give you good repeat playability. Just dont be trying too hard to win as nothing in Discworld goes quite according to plan.

RATING: 7
Played three times so far and have mostly enjoyed playing it. BUT... My biggest problem with the game is that there is too much player interaction (hang on a second, let me explain). By saying that I mean that there is too much scope for others to influence how well you're doing by moving into your regions, card play, killing your dudes, etc... It's fun while it lasts, but I get the feeling that I will tire of the game since good play isn't really rewarded as the other players can just neuter anyone who is starting to pull ahead and there doesn't seem to be any defence to them doing so.

This is a fun fillertype of game, even if it's a bit too long to be a real filler. I assume it's more fun for the lovers of Pratchetts world.

You need to ignore the fact that this is a Martin Wallace game because it is both humorous and chaotic. If you don't like games that finish unexpectedly or with a liberal dose of luck, you best look elsewhere. If you like the books you'll love the game... it hasn't been cobbled together as a tie-in as so many other games have tried to cash in on branding. The humour and in-jokes are all there as are the characters. But it's a try before you buy if you haven't read the books.

RATING: 7
Yes, it's very chaotic, not just because of how quickly the board state changes, but also because of the hundreds of different cards with varying usefulnesses.  On the flip side, it's a somewhat relaxing activity to try to string together cards in your hand to try to advance your goals as much as possible, without giving an opponent's goal too much of a boost.  I imagine this plays fairly differently with 3 (where you can probably figure out what everyone is going for) and with 4 (where it's much harder).  If you like fast-playing optimization games where you constantly have a barrage of options thrown at you and you don't get too attached to your board position, you might enjoy this game a lot.  Bonus points if you're a fan of the property.

The theme is all about the Discworld universe and although not essential to play, it adds greatly to the immersement/thematic enjoyment if you have read the books. The game is light to medium difficulty and easy to learn, fast to play. There is also a moderate amount of “take that” with some of the cards, not for all, but a game I love to play with the right group.

Lots of things to like about Discworld. You're basically deploying minions to take control of areas and building buildings that give you special abilities. The gameplay is pretty simple... play a card and do what it says (sometimes giving you the option to play more.) Refill your hand and wait for your next turn. I really like games with variable victory conditions and take that! actions, so this game is right up my alley. I suspect it's only going to get better with more plays under my belt.

This game got me into reading Terry Prachett. A random area control game with great artwork on the cards and neat mechanics. Love how the powers of the territories activate when you build houses. For me it's ideal with 3 players, but maybe with some practice might be also fine with 4. It's a bit complicated to keep track of what everyone might be up to in 4 player games, but it's still really fun. I love the events and just die for the chance to use them.

This is a very fast, very punchy game, where each player is given a secret goal, and a hand of 5 cards. On a player's turn they can play up to 2 cards, and do the actions on the card in the order shown at the top of the card. Then they draw back up to 5. If at the start of someone's turn, they have achieved their secret goal, then they win. The magic of the game is trying to take actions that would make someone believe you have a different goal than you actually have, so that when they punch you, your real goal doesn't get set back. The rules are very simple, but there's still a lot to think about, as you always need to be making educated guesses as to what other people are going for and how to stop them.

Something about the game that bothered me was the degree to which one has to pay attention to the board state. There are character roles who win if at the start of their turn if they control four areas, and that's a very easy goal to achieve if one or more players stop paying attention for a second. This can get tough when your secret goal is something like, collect a conspicuous amount of money, or have the game deck of action cards run out. It means game sessions are either amazing, or done disappointingly soon.  For example, in our fourth play, I was money guy, and players could kinda see I was stockpiling cash, so all the punish cash cards were being thrown my way. I was only a few turns in, and starting to build some steam, and then a player who needed to control four regions declared victory; game over. For my time, I would rather be playing A Study In Emerald.

Squarely aimed at the family games market, with the most streamlined set of Wallace rules I've ever seen, but it's not really any the worse for that. Beautifully produced, and with card play much more firmly tied to the board than in (the overrated IMO) London. The Discworld theme doesn't quite feel fully realised though - I spent a lot more time looking at the symbols on my cards than noticing which characters they represented.

Love the hidden goals and trying to grind out a win.  There are many times in a game where you’ve satisfied your winning condition, but after the other players have a turn, they completely reshape the outcome.  The game requires patience, but is fun!  Simple rule set, with great card artwork.  The event cards can be great or disastrous.  There is randomness but your decisions are relevant, and not overwhelmed.  Unique game in my collection.

Enjoyable art design and setting.
Should be good for adventurous non-gamers, and families.
I fear the role that only needs to have enough trouble spots to win is too easy - all they should have to do is get a building in the place that lets you place a trouble spot in or around it to win. It's not like ALL the other players are going to take a significant % of their precious actions solely to remove trouble spots, and if they did than he is winning because they aren't using their actions to help themselves, and they may not even get the cards to remove trouble spots, AND that would show an unbalanced design if everyone has to work together to stop that strategy.

The game is gorgeous to look at and the mechanics are tight enough, but drawing your winning condition randomly paired with the constant random drawing of cards makes for a game heavily reliant on luck.  Once player's deduce the personality cards present in the game, there's basically a random back and forth between players until one of two things happen- 1. No one draws a card that game stop the leader. 2. The deck runs out and THAT personality wins, or you add up points.

I don't think the personality cards are balanced appropriately. There's not enough ways to mess with the money personality and if you to advance towards your own goal you really can't help but help the deck run out of cards for another personality to win.

Overall: I like the basic mechanics of the game however it loses it's charm quickly as you start to notice the tedious back and forth nature of the game. A few small tweaks and this could be a real winner, but for now I'm just not terribly impressed.

I really love the try to figure out you opponents character and there are many card that aid you in this endeavor.  Know the hidden characters is important because you need to defend against all of them as you deduce who everyone is.

I would certainly play this game again. A lot of games based on popular works of fiction are ofen indulgent and over-long. Combining this with a designer who tends to recycle his own work sounded like a recipe for disaster.
However, Martin Wallace has scaled back a lot of his normal elements and done some fun things with the victory conditions. The game plays fairly quickly and has some interesting decision making. On the other hand I doubt I would play it again if it were not Discworld so that says something about the quality.

Better than might have been expected from an "official" Discworld boardgame - this is quite fun to play every once in a while, but is ultimately too random for me to want to do so often. Can also be quite frustrating when another player removes your win condition without even realising! I also wish there was a bit more variety in the hidden win conditions - having 3 of the 7 (iirc) being identical seems like lazy design.

I like the books and I also like the cards showing the characters of the books. First I thought there is much luck in the game because of the drawing of the action cards. But after some games I must say that I am able to control the game more than I first thought. For example the "Mr. Whiteface" is an evil card when played against you because it restricts the number of hand cards from 5 to 4. But you can counter this effect if you pay 5$. So make sure you always have 5$ ready to pay and you're save. You can also take over cards to the next round, so you can plan and don't depend too much on card drawing when you want to do a certain action, like for example creating a building. 

Chaining (playing several cards during your turn) offers the possibility for nice combos.

Warning: it can be very frustrating when the other players destroy or take over your buildings because they noticed you're about to fulfill your characters victory condition. Players should be capable of digging this. Good bluffing about your character (and therefore victory condition) helps ;-)

Update: In our games Mumm tends to win.

13-08-2015. Rated after 1 play. Ankh Morpork is based on a theme I don't care about, those books from one guy called Terry Pratchet..

IN the game, you have the city of AM. You have a hand of 5 cards that you try to play to obtain one of your goals. These goals are hidden, but are diverse enough that you can spot it during the game.
3 of the goals are based on controling territories on the board, some you need money, of trolls, or devils on the board. 

AM has a lot of take-that, screwage and interaction, it might actually be my favorite wallace, albeit his 'worst' game i played.

--Sep2011-- Amusing light random game.  It's quite charming - but not really a "Gamer's" game.  But, fortunately for me, it is something that amused my two youngest.  While I may well get tired of it, I'd guess (at this early juncture) we'll have at least a dozen plays before the little ones do.
--Jan2015-- Sadly, the young ones lost interest.  (As I'd done earlier.)

This game was quite reminiscnet of London in some ways, but with a bit more randomness.  The secret goals for each player meant that our first play was very short, as the other two players new to the game didn't watch for one of the goals, and as a result I won incredibly quickly.  I would have slight concerns about the balance of the different roles if I was to play this regularly I think, but as I have no plans to buy it, that probably won't be an issue for the few times I play it.

One of the better light games of 2011.

Relatively short playing duration for a game which comes up with different winning conditions. These goals appear a bit unbalanced, although watching your opponents and their actions is as important as your own way of proceeding. Very nice cards! More a soft game than a strategical masterpiece but a welcome change.

EDIT: Traded for "Kremlin" (Avalon Hill version).

RATING: 8
Very enjoyable game. One of the first "proper" board games I played, and I've used it several times since to get people into board gaming. The theme is whimsical and humourous, so despite people not knowing the books the players adapt a similar persona to throw jabs and insults at each other.

Still played as a medium-light game that takes about 30-45min, usually end up playing several times, as people get into it.

It has it's problems and pure strategy is hard to come by as everybody kicks the about-to-win player in the shins - but as a not-so-serious (small) party game it is a good opener. It is very good at making you feel like you could win if you could just do this one thing, but then everything conspires against you ensuing in hilarity for all. A game of this is usually followed by a lot of excited descriptions of how many times people were about to win and what they tried to do to not let people know their true goal.

Played the final prototype once. Didn't expect much, but still got grievously dissapointed. Theme is painfully pasted on, the Discworld characters on the cards are rarely connected to their effect, the choices are obvious and draw and negative interaction seriously hinders any longer strategy. Neither me nor any other players found it to be any particular fun. If it was faster and cheap - under 30min it could be a nice filler; maybe with more games under the belt it would be possible, but for now I'm not compelled to try it again.

RATING: 8
First Impressions: I don't really know why I preordered this except that I am pretty much a Wallace fanboy, and did enjoy the first few Discworld novels as a teenager. I am wary that my opinion may change, but I have certainly enjoyed the game so far after 4 2player games against Mrs Schkff. The board is a lot more important to the game than the one in London (to take another Wallace card game themed on a chaotic and malodorous metropolis as an example), the randomness is fun, and balanced by the fact that the cards only come in a small number of different types. Also, the trouble mechanic is classic Wallace - at first seems odd, then proves simple, thematic and gamey. The system wouldn't accept a 7a rating, and 9 seems a bit high just yet (might get there though) so for now this is a safe 7. 
[Edit after first 4 player game]: People who think that Vimes always wins are bufoons. Sorry, but this is true.
[Edit after reading Guards! Guards! for the first time] I can't get over how true to the spirit of Pratchett's writing this game is. Love it.

Readers of the books are going to enjoy the artwork as characters are brought to 2D life, the city is laid out before them and certain character actions loosely match what they'd expect from said characters. Those unfamiliar with the books are just going to find themselves stumbling through a chaotic, near random piece placing game.

Let's face it: Figuring out who's who isn't that tricky here. There's only so much bluffing you can do on the way to accumulating $50, or spreading minions out on the board as you try to build building in the two areas that allow you to buy further minions, or, or, or... So, you're at the mercy of the cards and the wild fluctuations they have in power (useful to your particular needs). It's good to be Vimes, but if you've read the books you know that already. Okay, the game is chaotic, but I can still enjoy it as a fan of the books, right? Well, yes and no. While I enjoy the flavour and the attempt at creating a simple 30-40 minute game, for me the mechanics are too dumbed down for their own good. There's a lack of meaningful decisions where I can say I played a good move. No satisfaction after a win. Frustration at being picked on and having three turns unraveled in one.

I reckon this is a much better two or three player game than it is with four. There's more scope for bluffing and the ganging up on the leader element is removed or reduced. I'd play it happily with two and less so with three and no much at all with four. If your spouse is a Discworld fan then this short and easy 2-3 player game might be for you.

RATING: 7
This game is as simple as play a card and do whatever it says. It feels like a game of achieving majorities, but it really isn't, cause every player have a different objective and not all of them will have to control areas to win. Simple, fast, beautiful artwork, nice bits and a great story behind.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
This game is just unbalanced in a bad way. Everyone draws cards from a common deck, each card has a number of symbols which are the actions that card does (and some have text that's executed). One symbol lets you play another card. This is a problem because at the end of your turn you draw your hand back up to 5. So if you have a hand of cards that don't let you play another your turn is play, draw, go. This would be fine but while you're doing play, draw, go, your opponent is chaining off 3 cards per turn since playing more cards means drawing more cards and having more impact on the board due to nothing but luck.

The second problem is the secret win conditions. Each player has 1 (of I believe 9) win conditions to fulfill, these are all spelled out clearly on a very well done player aid. If you meet your victory condition at the start of your turn, you win. This is a problem because as a player you have to make sure the next player won't have any of them met when your turn is finished. This isn't too hard, really, if you're paying attention, and also the other players will point it out. The problem arises in that it's really too easy to prevent this from happening, and one person's win condition is to run the deck out of cards. You can't prevent that in any interactive way. So if everyone makes sure to not let the others win, and someone has this win condition, they will probably just win. You could play without that win condition, but the 'tiebreaker' win conditions for running the deck out are pretty unsatisfying.

I get that this is a light game, it's just not a terribly well thought out game. I'd guess it's target audience are fans of the novel, who if are not gamers would probably love it (because it's a very nice production and the game "works").

Didn't like this much at all. It sure feels like a game that was ready to go, and then retrofitted with the Discworld theme. Other than all the name-dropping, there was very little that was Discworld-y about it.

Also, some of the victory conditions seem insane. If you've got the run-through-the-deck guy, but you don't have any way to churn through your cards, you're screwed.

And if the slightest movement removes a conflict marker, how in the heck is the conflict-marker guy supposed to fulfill that victory condition?

Anyway. Glad I played once. Don't need to play it again.

Played 2 games back to back and both ended with someone's special victory conditions.  Neither game lasted an hour so this makes a great filler - or opener - or nightcap game.  

You need to be on your toes and pay attention to what folks are doing to prevent them from achieving their secret goal while still working towards yours.  

The only disappointment was that in neither game did we see trolls or demons!

This is one of those games that people are either going to like or hate.  There is a lot of randomness and "take that", which if played with the wrong people can suck.  If it's played with the right crew, everyone - even the aggrieved - will have a bunch of good laughs.  Trying to figure out who has what personality is the core of the game as the cards pretty much play themselves.  Plenty of decisions, tho, as to what order to play your cards, where to place minions and buildings, etc.  There are better games out there, to be sure, but there are also a lot worse ones as well.  I'd definitely play this again.

Thought I would like it better. Maybe the problem was playing with gamers, while this seems to be a perfect nongamer game - it's easy to pick up and offers a hefty amount of chaos, so veterans don't have a lot (if any) advantage. The most important part of the game is everybody knowing and checking for possible victory conditions of other players. 

One plays each game much differently depending on its character, but during the game you mostly ride the chaos of the card deck. More of a ride with a bit of guessing. (I'd rather play Citadels) Overall too fluffy, might rate better if played by nongamers who are Discworld fan(atic)s.

Based on a Martin Wallace prototype seen at Cancon/AGE 2011.

Fairly simple game considering it's Wallace. Players have a hand of cards and play off one card each turn and draw a card. Actions are played onto a board from Terry Pratchett's Discworld series.

There are hidden objectives and cards help achieve it. Some objectives include area control, winning if NO other players achieve their objectives, earning a certain amount of money.

Martin binned the prototype after the convention.

I'll put this out there - I _love_ Discworld. I love the books, I love the movies, and I love at least one of the board games.

The only shortcoming of the theme is that the game mechanics and the theme suit each other, but don't really reinforce each other much. Perhaps a little in the hidden roles. I can't think of an area control game that does, so use Gloom as an example - the theme explains the mechanics and the mechanics give substance to the theme.

The gameplay is fun - the hidden roles are set up so that even on other players' turns it pays off to stay alert for win conditions that might be coming up for someone else. I feel that table talk is a must for this game.

Why 10 for Ankh-morpork, for sure I like this game and the background.

Until the end it's hard to determine who will win, there is always an hope to reach the victory, even when everything seems to be lost.

For me a game of Ankh-Morpork is always fun, and it never lasts too long.

It's playable from 2 to 4 players with the same duration.

Bemutató videók és leírások alapján jobbra számítottam. Tudtam, hogy káoszos játék, de ekkora szerencse szerepre nem számítottam.
A játékosok lapokból játszanak és térképen megpróbálnak a céljuknak megfelelő területet foglalni és házakat építeni. Egymás akadályozása nagyon fontos, de emiatt a királycsináló rész is nagyon jelen van a játékban. Mindenkire nem lehet figyelni. A kártyaelfogyós célt pedig akadályozni se lehet. Az, hogy milyen lapot kap a játékos a kezébe mindent eldönt. De nem ezek voltak a fő gondjaim a játékkal, hanem, hogy túl egyértelmű. Sokat nem kell rajta gondolkodni, teljesen egyértelmű melyik kártyát kell kijátszani. Egyes célok még minimális gondolkodást sem igényelnek a játék közben. Tehát túl egyszerű és túl szerencsefüggő. Ehhez még jön a nagy nyelvfüggőség. Aki a játék témáját ismeri, olvasta annak biztos nagy élmény lehet játszani, mert nagyon szépek a kártyák, aranyosak a szövegek. Nekem csalódás volt, de könnyedsége miatt azért nem utasítanék el később se partit vele.

[2017-07-15]
Majdnem pontosan 5 év után játszhattam vele újra és bár fenntartok mindent, amit korábban írtam élvezetileg nem rossz élmény a játék. Bár a paklielfogyásos célt nem lehet akadályozni, mégis az 50 pénzes cél tűnik a legkönnyebbnek. 30 perc alatt szabállyal együtt lement a játék és ha így nézem, akkor a brutális szerencsefaktor mellett néha játszható a társas.

This game has a good portion of luck in it, since everything is done with randomly drawn cards - which vary greatly in usefulness and overall power. Also the characters (which give the players their respective goals) are pretty unbalanced as it seems. I am mostly talking about two player games here, but to us it seems very Rock-Paper-Scissors alike (Mumm beats the Dragon King, who tops Vetinari which in return has no problem stomping Mumm and the Lords are inferior to all of them). Still, this issue is not as big as it may seem.

Good game for people, who value fun and random mayhem over extremely tactical battles.

Mr Wallace has created another winner. Gets played quite a bit in my group because it has high interaction, is not too long for what it is, and the hidden asymmetrical player winning conditions make for some serious table talk. I haven't read the books, by the way, and I love the game, so don't worry at all if you haven't. The game just feels unique - from the theme to the actual gameplay, and it is always fun, even when your buildings are getting destroyed, or a flood is wiping out your minions. It doesn't take itself too seriously, and you probably shouldn't either when playing. 

I think another reason why folks like it so much is that it is really pleasant to play. Because no one knows what you are really up to, you don't have to worry too much about making huge mistakes, or missing that one chance you had - it's really pretty casual. 


The Cons: I really think it's easiest to win with Vimes. Im sure there are forum entries about why thats not true, but man, it really seems like he is way easier to win with than the others. 

Way. Easier.

Upped rating from 6 (2011) to 7 (2013). 

Initially brushed this game off as light and silly and entirely dictated by luck. Well, a few years later and I still feel that way, however, the game is such a quick and light area control game that really required everyone to go out of their way to try to stop one another from winning that it's completely satisfying when played with good bluffers and people who know that it's their responsibility to foil others. The theme and production value as well, help to push this game to a 7 for me.

So light and streamlined, D:AM feels nothing like a Wallace game. The hidden victory conditions infuse a bit of strategy into an otherwise tactical game, though I still think it's all a bit too chaotic. I feel that the card draw determines decisions more than it should. I haven't read the books, so I don't appreciate the theme like fans do, but the game makes me want to.

[b]--- Game Summary ---[/b]
The board shows Ankh-Morpork, divided into 12 numbered regions. Each region shows a $ value and is associated with a specific building (cards set nearby). There's a deck of cards (sets A and B; A on top): shuffle and deal each player 5? cards. Some minions are placed on the board (randomly?). Players each get a secret random card, which defines their win-condition (e.g., have minions in x regions; collect $50 in cash and assets; control x regions; etc.). If your win condition is present at the start of your turn, you win!

On your turn, play a card and use the icons shown at the top (left to right; most optional, some required). These may give you money, allow you to place a minion or buy a building, draw a card, play another card, etc. Then use the text on the card, which has a variety of effects. Any time you place or move one minion with another, add a Trouble Token (if one isn't already present). These prevent players from buying the building in that region, and are related to one of the win conditions (have x regions with Trouble tokens). If you use a card to move another minion away, the trouble token in the original location (if any) goes with it. Your turn is all about the cards you get to play, and the actions they give you (or if you're unlucky, the single card you get to play). When you build buildings, you get more abilities you can use each turn.

[b]--- Comments ---[/b]
I guess if you're a fan of the book series, or at least somewhat familiar with the characters and story, the game may be more entertaining. For me, it was mostly a way-too-chaotic experience. I felt totally at the mercy of the cards I happened to draw; and I rarely drew the cards that would let me play more than one per turn! There are also a lot of cards that allow you to target other players (moving or removing their minions, messing with their hands or their buildings, etc.); that gets to be pretty annoying, too! 

I suppose I wouldn't mind trying this again (a full game, one sitting!) with a fan of the game; but it doesn't at all seem like my kind of game!

This game is a sort of area control game with hand management and hidden roles.  Each player starts the game with a hidden role which details their victory condition which is usually based on the board state.  All players know the possible characters and victory conditions in the game so while trying to accomplish their own goal can also try to figure out what roles other players have and prevent them from accomplishing their own.  When a player's turn starts with their condition met they win the game.

The gameplay itself is very simple.  On your turn you play a card from your hand.  The card you play has a list of symbols across the top that affect the board in different ways (such as placing your pieces out or removing others) and many also have their own unique text ability.  Some also let you play other cards so you're not necessarily left to one card play per turn.  I actually quite like this.  The game has a good amount of variety on the 100-something cards while also being very simple to teach and also plays pretty quickly.  Probably an hour or less with the full complement of 4 players.

My absolute favorite part of the game is the artwork though.  I now want to read all the Discworld books because the pictures on the cards are beautiful and delightfully wacky.  The very first card played in my first game was titled "Librarian" and had a picture of an orangutan eating a banana and reading a book on it.  How do you not just want to know the story behind that?

I do have some issues with the game though that keep me from loving it.  Mostly with the imbalance and lack of variety among the hidden roles.  There are 7 possible roles and they are not all created equal.  With the need for having your victory condition met on the start of your turn there is a lot of opportunity for other players to mess with your plans when you've actually set yourself up before it gets back to you.  One of the role's victory condition is for the deck of cards to run out without another player winning.  This seems like it is one of the easier ones to accomplish because you simply need to play defense the whole game (which the other players are most likely going to be doing as well) until you get to the end.

Also, there are 7 roles and 3 of them are the same; control a certain number of areas (based on number of players).  This makes it both a little less interesting and a little easier to figure out your opponents roles when close to half of them have the same victory condition.

Besides my issues with the roles though this is a great, accessible game that teaches and plays quickly with a lot of interaction and fun images.

RATING: N/A
Got a good first impression. Played a 2 player game and it was easy to grasp and to understand. Very easy to get into. Cards are the main business here and you may depend on luck driven as much as in a die roll but I found the game funny to play and that's something considering the fact that I'm not a fan of fantastic themed games.
The art work is amazing in my opinion and even the board, which for some looks a bit too busy, is very thematic and beautiful.

have to play it with more players because I think the game gets better with 3 or 4 rather than  with just 2.

Played a second game this time with 3 players. It's better than with 2 because it increases the interaction. With 2 players sometimes we don't even interact because there's no chance of doing it. With 3 players randomness increases too (I can only imagine with 4 players!!!) and also downtime is bigger.
The victory conditions seem a bit unbalanced but then again I've only played the game twice só it's just a feeling because this last game I played with 3 players the ending condition achieved seemed impossible to achieve in another game. I guess each game is a different game!

I played a prototype April, 2011.  The game may change - I certainly hope so.  At this point it appeals only to Pratchett fans in that it evokes the mood of the Discworld books very well.  Unfortunately for gamers who are not Pratchett fans, that mood includes a heck of a lot of chaos.  It's impossible to plan anything.  So if these rules don't change by the time they go to the printer, and you're not a Discworld fan, this game won't please you.  Pratchett fans will be pleased with the atmosphere and laugh heartily throughout the game.  Laughter is good.

I wanted to like this game.  I still might, but the game I played was so short, I had a hard time deciding if I even liked it our not.  I have never read any Discworld so I have no idea about the theme or how well it matches; but it did seem to be an interesting setting. 

Ripped: Each player has a secret personality with specific victory conditions, which means that you're not sure exactly what the other players need to do in order to win.
The action takes place on a map of Ankh-Morpork, with players trying to place minions and buildings through card play. Each of the 132 cards is unique, and says Wallace, "The cards bring the game to life as they include most of the famous characters that have appeared in the various books. The rules are relatively simple: Play a card and do what it says. Most cards have more than one action on them, and you can choose to do some or all of these actions. Some cards also allow you to play a second card, so you can chain actions."

 I like the idea of 'trouble' and using markers to determine where the 'trouble' is and being able to manipulate the trouble to your advantage.  The cards seem to be a little too random., but since you have a hand of them, you can mitigate the luck through planning.   The game ended shockingly early as one of the players hidden victory conditions was attained very early.   The excuse was that once you've played the game and learn the victory conditions of the other characters, you will be able to protect against that and it shouldn't end so quickly.   It seems to be too easy of an excuse to me.   I need to play it again in order to get a better feel for it.  I am sure my rating will change after even one play that lasts more than 15 minutes.

Interesting area control mechanics, nice material and cards. On the other hand there's high luck in card draw and random events, some very harsh aggressive cards classic problems of aggressive "free for all" games and a pretty mediocre balance (hidden roles, power level of cards). Definitly too long for what it is.

This is the "Smash Up" of area control games: it's surprisingly light-weight, frustratingly chaotic, and you can't even guess what the play area is going to look like by the time it gets back to your turn.  I played the Collector's Edition (or was it the Deluxe Edition??), so all the components were quite nice, with a large, spacious board, tactilely pleasing wooden tokens, and nice cards with cute artwork.  That being said, I've never read a Pratchett book, so I'm sure that a lot of the thematic elements flew straight over my noggin.  The truly simple game play was a plus for a game this chaotic, but I don't think that 4 players is an ideal player count due to the frequency of board-altering events that make long-term strategy a futile endeavor.  In fact, it is my belief that with 4 players it is impossible for any of the lords whose victory condition involves controlling at least 4 regions for an entire turn to win as long as the character whose win condition is to have the deck run out is in play, due to the fact that all players are keeping a suspicious eye on anyone who controls too many regions and all have an opportunity to do something about it before it gets back to that player's turn again.  That was a rather long sentence and I'm not sure that it made much sense (but that's also how I might describe Discworld: Ankh-Morpork).  It might be a decent game to play with kids if it weren't for the fact that much of the game involves tearing down what other players are trying to build up.  Oh well, I guess I need less pork in my life, not more.  Game design: 3/5  Personal enjoyment: 2/5  Total: 5/10

Hmmm. Played twice with full complement of four; the second game was quite different than the first, though Vimes won both.

There's a lot of luck to the game and the cards restrict your options a lot, but there are goals to achieve and a variety of decisions to make about how to achieve those goals -- as with many luck-heavy games, the question is how much your decisions [i]matter[/i].

The main reasons to buy are the gorgeous, thematically appropriate components (particularly in the collector's edition, where the natural numbers go 7, [url=http://wiki.lspace.org/wiki/7a]7a[/url], 9). For Pratchett fans, it's a feast: every card is named for a character or location from the Discworld, beautifully illustrated, and has a (vaguely) appropriate set of actions.

The biggest downsides for me are that I'm not sure how it will hold up once the novelty wears off, it has the potential to run long, and it may be too complex for non-gamers who aren't that interested.

I'm losing some enthusiasm after seeing three Vimes wins in three games.

After 5 plays I am concerned that the winner will be the one with the 'Deck Runs Out' condition because it is simply too easy to stop another player. If that is the case, then its a real shame because this is otherwise a good fun game. Maybe the answer is to not play it with gamers involved, but then that means me out.

Good fun if a bit heavy on the luck. fans of the theme will have a laugh identifying characters on the cards but it works pretty well as a game. We've had about 3 plays so far and it seems like Vimes may be a bit unbalanced, as he's won both the games he's appeared in. Still enjoyed it though. 

edit: I still think Vimes is the best character but that's ok. This has proved quite popular with my wife, so for that alone it gets marked up.

RATING: 6
Area majority game with hidden goals set in Terry Pratchett's Discworld universe. At the start of the game each player is given a secret character card that determines what they need to do to win e.g. gain control of a certain number of areas, acquire a certain amount of money, playing through the game until the deck of action cards is exhausted etc. Gameplay is driven through the playing of cards which allow certain actions to be taken, such as placing agents onto areas of the board, assassinating opponents' agents, triggering events etc, and these can be combined for greater effect. 'D:A-M' is a fairly chaotic affair but it incorporates its theme well and should be of some interest to fans of Pratchett's books (one of which I am not particularly). Designer Martin Wallace always brings something new to his games, and in this case the simplicity of the cards' actions works really well, but overall there isn't really enough substance here for 'D:A-M' to rank alongside many of his other designs and it all feels a little too light.

RATING: 9.25
A card-based strategy board game for 2-4 players set in the (here beautifully illustrated) comic fantasy city of Ankh-Morpork. Simple and quite fast (45-90 mins) to play, but very strategically deep and varied due to the different (and secret) win condition each player is dealt at the beginning of the game. For example, your condition may be you only win by spreading your minions widely; the other goals are amassing money, or controlling a proportion of the city,* or simply stalling or causing trouble. So there is an element of social deduction, but unlike Werewolf style games you do not win by guessing your opponents' identities.**

So far so good, but it gets better! It works just as well with 2 players as with 4. Further, each of the over a hundred central cards are different, often very silly and fun with their abilities, which adds lots of variety. Moreover, on every play those of us who are Discworld fans continue to enjoy the many references, but those we've played with who know nothing about it do not suffer from a feeling of missing out, and can understand the game perfectly well. Ultimately, play is very fluid with all the mechanics working so well, it would be easy not to notice all the strategy going on underneath the beautiful surface. But Ankh-Morpork does indeed have the best balance of strategic complexity to ease of any game I'm aware of. The main downside is how luck-based the ending can get if a lot of 'random event' cards are played. But with the overall quality, it's fantastic that Discworld creator Terry Pratchett lived to see his work celebrated by this high class product.

* Given that you can own property that in areas you don't control, it seems strange that you can't have a secret identity who wins through building property rather than controlling areas, so there's space to improve the game there.

** Although I think you could make a house rule where you could gamble something on guessing correctly.

This is an area control game.  It is rather simple to play and much simpler than it looks.  Games don't last too long.  A 3-player game takes less than an hour to finish.

Each player randomly draws a personality card at the beginning.  This card determines the win condition for the player.  Most of the win conditions are based on achieving certain board positions.  One is based on getting enough money.  One is to make sure no one wins by the time the game ends. 

During a turn, you play a card which lists what actions they may take during the turn.  Some cards allow you to play more cards.  Actions include, but not limited to placing a minion, building a building, killing a minion in an area with a trouble marker, and removing a trouble marker.  Some cards have special effects listed in the text of the card.  Some actions costs money or possibly allow you or other players to gain or lose money.

You can build buildings which will give you some ability you can activate each turn.  You will need to pay for the cost of the building.

Some cards cause random events to happen which could help or hinder you or your opponents.  The random events add an interesting element in the game.  They also appear on more powerful cards you play.

As the win conditions vary between players, part of the strategy is to determine what the win conditions of other players are.  Sometimes, you need to play a card to prevent another player from winning instead of advancing towards your win condition.

Not having read any Terry Pratchet, this looked really uninteresting when I was looking at the components and having the game explained to me, but I enjoyed it much more than I expected to. It has aspects of deduction, area control and very simple (and light) take-that card play.

Vimes seems like it might be a little overpowered though the money win option might be even easier (it wasn't in our game, but 2 of the 3 players exceeded 50 money pretty quickly).

Update: On a second play, Vimes (me) won again. It does break the game because everyone is (should be!) trying to stop any other win condition for everyone else so Vimes should always win out. Also, rarely have I ever paid so little attention to what everyone else is doing.

Everyone has a secretpersonality. The problem is everyone`s playing in favour of Vimes, because he wins, when no other player wins. So when Vimes is in play, he will usually win.

This game has the same feel than Drakon 3rd edition, which happens to be one of my absolute favorites. Rather simple rules and game strategy is a mix of trying to win and prevent other players from winning. Same arguments over who is about to win and who actually is the leader that should be bashed. :) If you don't like that kind of games and take that, you won't like this game. 

Despite having the same feel, these two games are very different as well. Drakon is about tile laying and coin collecting and Ankh-Morpork is a card game with a board and some area majority thrown in.

I was pretty underwhelmed by this Martin Wallace design, but then I'm not a fan of the Discworld books and felt a little like I was let out of an inside joke the entire time playing this. Theme aside, this is a pretty simple game where the mechanics are streamlined and work well, but the asymmetrical goals can really be unbalanced and sour folks on the game. The event cards also throw unneeded randomness into the works. I'd certainly play again - Discworkd plays fairly quickly and is mostly harmless - but given the pedigree of the designer, it's a somewhat disappointing design.

If you like chaotic fun, this one will grow on you over the course of your first game, just as you're about to claim victory only to see it crumble away in disastrous fashion. Being a fan of the books helps, but any fantasy fan will be able to enjoy the gameplay and theme here.

First impression: Area control game with hidden objectives. Some characters share objectives, others are very similar, so it os not too difficult to keep track of who could win. It is just a question of paying proper attention and counting everyone's pieces when it is your turn. Since you cannot plan ahead due to the destructive nature of the card plays of the other players, the game is pretty much based on what cards you draw and which of the cards is playable when it is your turn. Makes it seem very luck based.

What definitely speaks in favor of the game is its playing time. 

I have concerns though that there are some overpowered cards and I think the different victory conditions aren't different enough in that four of these victory conditions  include placing your henchmen in the districts. What bothers me in this is that if you are one of those players there's no need for you to try and confuse your opponents and lead them on the wrong trail. But with one of the unique victory conditions you'll need to do just that. But then again: maybe you shouldn't bother also. 
Ok game

This is an interesting litte game. My sister owns it and there it stays. But there are many times when I wish I owned it so I could play it more. I'm a huge Wallace fan, and here he manages to accomplish a simple, thematic, light-weight game that still feels like Wallace. What I mean by "Wallace" is that even though the game is on the lighter end of the spectrum, the decisions still feel relatively heavy. Every decision you make is important, and there are a plethora of good/interesting decisions at every turn. I like the implementation of hidden identities in the game. It works well. The more players get to know the characters in the deck, the more fun this game becomes trying to figure out who everybody is, and eventually becoming a game that involves a bit of bluffing and curveballing. As I talk about it, I wish I had my own copy. :)

RATING: 6
Seems really fun if everyone is experienced enough to understand the implications of each move, but there's a high potential for "Oops, I win" moments. The easiest way to win is for other people to not notice what you're up to, and while sometimes that's a result of craftiness, sometimes it feels totally arbitrary.

Hey, guess what?  This game is fucking rad.  The hidden objectives are cool, and they play out in such a way that the first time you play will be a complete shot in the dark, but as you get more plays under your belt you will start to notice and understand people's motives for taking certain card actions sooner and sooner.  Interaction that can *feel* downright mean but really isn't.  Game is tactical in all the right ways.

RATING: 7
Only played with the collector's edition, and it is really well made with great artwork. The gameplay is thematic: bursts of chaos in the ever-changing enviroment of Ankh-Morpork.

The gameplay is smooth, all based in the use of many-purposes cards (the cards can have up to 3 icons, all with different uses, and sometimes also special abilities that the player can choose to use or not).

I would rated it a 8, if not for Grimes. The player with Grimes wins if the deck runs out, and in my experience, if all the players knows how to play well, and control each other, Grimes has a huge advantage, which I don't find right. There is an easy fix though: leave him out. But since he came with the game, it takes away a better rating.

RATING: 6.6
The game itself is fun and easy mechanics to teach, but the wording is very inconsistent.  Having to check the FAQ on multiple cards or treat different words as meaning the same thing lowers my score.  I think a reprint with a huge editing pass would up my score at least .5.

Played Prototype with 4 players - Entertaining lightish card driven game.  Good use of theme.  Basics of the game are each player has a hidden objective which if met (generally for the start of their turn) allows them to win the game.  This is also a bit of a downside as the latter stages of the game turn into everyone trying to ensure the player after them does not win, or just trashing possible winning positions.  This is not the only game that does this, however I did find it quite frustrating (possibly as I had given away my objective too early in the game).  Would be more than happy to play again though.

A great family game, perhaps the best there is. The card imbalances, deduction pleasures, and terribly fun blocking work really well in a non-gamer environment. When the parents get out-psyched & trounced by the kids, well, it's special. And the quirky rules guiding the trouble markers are still pure Wallace, creating a nice pathway into his denser thickets.  

Very funny cards & artwork, beautifully rendered. 

I also would love to play this with gamers (I haven't), but I think it's be a fun romp & have a nice player-driven imbalance.

RATING: 7.5
Played once. First impressions.  As with anything related to Terry Pratchet this game is wacky, and that's a good thing.  The art is pretty kool and the game is well designed and appealing.  I like the randomness in that you don't know what your win conditions are going to be before you start the game.  Having different win conditions for the different personalities also makes the game more intriguing and, in a way, chaotic.  The game is all strategy with a little bit of luck depending on the cards you draw and dice rolls.  With only two players it can get a little cut-throat.  Immediately after the first game there was a call for a rematch!  Unfortunately time did not allow for one.  I will definitely be playing this again.

Two more plays and raising my rating slightly.  Enjoying the variety of "Personality" win conditions.  Still only played two player, definitely want to get more players in on this.

Worker placement where the meeples cut each other's throat.  Going into this game you will need to realize that planning is limited by random card draws from a common deck.  Luckily the small amount of dice rolling adds very little to the overall randomness.  There are many crazy moments (typically between 7 and 9) so even though this is a gotcha game it is family friendly as well. The game design is extremely refined for the level of depth, like a well made animation version of a classic tail.  In terms of fluff the skin fits well with the mechanics.

The game certainly looks the part though. Gameplay might get better with subsequent plays (with the same group) and if you are a fan of the Discworld novels, feel free to add a point to my rating.

This game is very hard for me to pin down.  It's chaotic, and almost entirely tactical (rather than strategic) as a result, but as long as everyone is paying attention to the possible win conditions, your decisions are still meaningful.

I'm not sure I would appreciate it as much, or even have given it a second chance, if the theme wasn't applied so well to the elements.  I wouldn't say "integrated", but applied is definitely accurate, and as a fan of the books, that probably lets me overlook the level of randomness inherent in the cards a little more than I would otherwise.  

The game also teaches SUPER-quickly, as it's play 1 card, do what the symbols say in order (reference the player aids for what the symbols do) and draw up to your 5 card hand limit.

RATING: 7.5
Fast-paced, easy to play area control game.  The hidden roles with independent paths to victory are really what make the game.  Otherwise it's a pretty simple game of just playing cards and taking the actions with some random chaos thrown in at the end of the game.

It's great for not over-staying it's welcome.  There's a momentarily slow start as people start claiming their initial territories.  Things quickly heat up as competition rises, and then things get really chaotic as the events start popping up and then it's over.

I wish the player count went a bit higher and it'd see more play.  I so often have 5 players that when I do have 3 or 4, there are a lot of great games to chose from.

After a couple of turns at this game, you'll realize how much you'll need luck to play along. Then, a few more games later, you'll see how you can adjust somewhat to luck & set yourself up for opportunities to deceive & get your own on. Yeah, this game will deal you an existential FU something fierce if it's just not in the mood for you to get a leg up, but most of the time, if you cats know the nuances of the cards and their combinations well, you can get a good tussle going. Luck + Strategy =Life (which I give an 8, as well, if you're asking).

One game behind with three newbies and one experienced player. All of us were too focused on each one's target that we really didn't pay any attention to other players possible victory conditions. Hardcoregamer won, I was the next player and I would have won, but that didn't happen. So it was quite tight game. Lots of luck and random elements, but they fit the game well. The theme is of course something that I like and different characters and events are nicely converted as a game. With a group of Pratchett readers this might be a very nice game for the evening.

Second play with 3, a bit similar as the first: Lots of focus on the own victory condition. But with three players it was easier to focus on the game as well and follow what others were doing. I believe there is game somewhere there, but it takes more plays to reveal...

Wallace's take on area control. Rules seem a bit fiddly for what should be a straight forward game. As with all of his games, the board and components leave much to be desired.

I'm not sure how this game would be for folks who aren't into Discworld.  There's definitely an interesting set of mechanisms here (and some that remind me a lot of Martin's style, which is no surprise, really), and no dearth of randomness and chaos in the game, but understanding the references and characters from the series is a large part of enjoying the game.  It has interrupt cards (possibly my least favorite mechanism of them all), and event cards which have the potential to destroy whatever progress you've made up to that point (my [i]second[/i]-least favorite mechanism), but it all fits in with the theme rather perfectly.  It's not one to own, by any means, but it sure is a lot of fun to play.

RATING: 7.5
Hate the luck in cards, love everything else. Some cards are just so much better than others (like Moist von Lipwig - place minion, get money, draw cards and play another card, why would you not play this card? It's just pure awesome). Seems like some cards should have some sort of corruption (or other negative effect) to balance their greatness. But the ease of play, the theme, the hidden roles, everything else is just great, if only the cards could get a little bit of fixing.

RATING: 3
The mechanic starts working on 4 people. The cards are imbalanced which combined with randomness of drawing them is making the game totally unpredictable in means of a winner. Luckbased game with no room for a plan. I would only recommend this game for Pratchett fans, monopoly lovers and groups of players with different boardgame skill levels to ensure that everyone has an equal chance of winning.

The retrophrenologist card had me chuckling both in reminiscence of the book, and in the context of the game. There seem to be two very broken unfun cards ("Dr Whiteface" and "The Fool's Guild") - especially for ppl playing their first game. Apart from those cards, the game seems balanced.

Be a big wig in the biggest most influential city on the disc!

Essentially a area control game but with secret goal aggendas thrown in to promote chaos, oh and there will be a LOT of chaos.

fast playing, good solid componants and good theme with the cards, especially ifn your crowd actualy know the books; the cards are almost a game in and of themselves about trying to place characters to books and fathom out actually who they are, who the hell is Modo anways; gardener at the UU?

you can even ifn you  fanboyish enough buy a special discworld D12 with no number eight...

RATING: 7
Very chaotic, but lots of room for strategic maneuvering also.  If you don't like take-that card play or random events smashing up your hard work, steer clear!

Despite the compounded randomness of the cards and events, there are really a lot of interesting decisions to be made each turn--enough that I don't feel like the game is lost in the chaos.  There's hand management in the card play, area control in the minions, and a small amount of economy building.  The game is mostly tactical--doing what you can with the cards you have--but I often found myself planning a few turns in advance to set myself up for a building that fit into a larger strategy.

I'm not familiar with Discworld universe, but the the theme is really fun anyway and the art is fantastic.

Even though there's no direct fighting and no distinct factions, the card-directed area control and the player- and game-generated chaos feels a bit like Chaos in the Old World to me.  That game is definitely tighter and deeper, but this one feels a little like a Chaos in the Old World game spinning out of control.  I think it's fun.

A fun, chaotic, light game.

Different end goals make it interesting.  Short enough that the chaos doesn't offend.

Fun / Fast and really easy to teach others how to play. I believe luck of the card draw can be lowered by variants. Hopefully an expansion comes out with more different personalities. 

Didnt encounter the Vimes problem mentioned by many other players yet.

Then again.. only had 6 plays before writing ths comment.

Played a variant for 2p where each person selects 2 identities and wins when any of it is accomplished. Waay fun that way. 

This game needs more identities!!

Not the sort of game I have come to love (and indeed expect) from Martin Wallace. This comes off as a light take-that effort that feels light-years behind gems like Automobile and Steam.

As a great fan of Pratchett this was a must buy. Unfortunately the game itself was not so great. If not for the theme, this would be gone.

I liked it pretty much as it is simple with a good feeling of "anyone could be winning in a few turns but who?", a particular mechanic to gain control of areas, remove opponents minions and so.There's nothing terribly new but the ingredients are very well mixed, it plays fast and it is very enjoyable. I lost my first game and i was ready to play it again immediately: good sign!

Theme: none.
The cards have names from the discworld universe. The game board claims to be Ankh-Morpork (but doesn't fit the description from the books). You could rename the cards to any setting - ancient, sci-fi, whatever - and wouldn't need to change anything, because there is nothing related to a specific theme. Lots of cards with generic actions - gain some gold, remove a cube, gain a buy, draw a card, gain an extra card action. In fact, it looks like card design was greatly inspired by Dominion.

Gameplay:
Area control at its worst. Lot's of 'bash the leader'. Totally at the mercy of the cards - one player could only play 1 weak card per turn for most of the game, while another one was able to constantly play 2+ more interesting cards.

Balance:
One faction wins when the deck runs out. Unless one player gets very lucky with his cards, he wins, since you are usually able to prevent the other victory conditions from happening. 

Personal experience:
At one point, i stopped to play against other players, i just wanted the game to end. Unfortunately, it didn't. When the deck run out, it turned out that the one faction wth the auto-win wasn't in the game. We didn't bother to count points.

Caveat:
I know one player who totally likes this game, for the pure chaos. Most players were glad when the game finally ewas over.

As a huge Discworld fan, I enjoy playing this one for all the references. It's simple to teach, and it plays smoothly. I like that players each have different victory conditions, so that it's not a simple race for points. It is relatively light as games go, though.

Lord Vetinari has vanished and the opportunistic factions of Ankh-Morpork are trying to increase influence of the city in his absence.  As special characters of these factions we each have separate winning conditions. You have to first remove trouble markers from an area. Otherwise, it has all the basic trimmings; play a card, activate a card, move a minion, control an area, build something, roll some dice, draw a card. Event cards will cause area disturbances like trolls or demons or riots oh my.  You can string together big moves. The trick is to figure out the other players to interfere with their winning objectives. Light game with decent decision points. Nice board of the city and great job capturing the history and feel of Ankh-Morpork. As a fan of Pratchett, this one likely makes its way to the collection.

My first game back into board gaming. My wife may well be regretting buying me this now... Great little game I got Xmas 2014. Thoroughly enjoyed it. Funny and engaging and a great gift for anyone who loves Pratchett's Discworld novels like me. Got me back into board gaming after 30 years. Because no one else would play it with me after Xmas I was forced to buy a co-op... hello Arkham.

I did a bit of playtesting for this. A decent family-orientated game with good thematic elements and moderate randomness. I love the hidden victory conditions but their variety means that in the first game you may not be paying attention to how other players can win. With subsequent games, this issue goes away (or you can carefully study all the win conditions in advance).

Gift from some good Finnish elves to my Love but I am the lucky one to put it into our BGG collection :)

We played a lunchtime 2-player introductory game and liked it a lot. The artwork is impressive and memories of Pratchett's books pop up so alive. Poor that one red wooden minion came headless.

RATING: 7
Very simple mechanics for a Martin Wallace game. Fairly tight, though there may be a problem with the winning conditions for Vimes if everyone playing is overfamiliar with the game - i.e. players can spot a winning condition fairly easily, leading to stalement that results in the game ending when the deck is exhausted. If Vimes is in play then that player wins. Obviously, the way around this is to become very good at bluffing and playing a strategy outside of your characters winning conditions to put people off the trail. The danger though, is that you might help another player out. 

The cards a beautiful though, and the random events suitably chaotic. Good fun...

A 2-4 player area control game. Players take turns playing cards from their hand to take the actions on those cards, trying to complete a secret objective and preventing others from doing the same.

A solid one from Martin Wallace. I give it a 8, because too much in this game depends on luck, meaning the disasters that happen randomly, and the uncertainty of said events. That means that even if one player has made great strategical progress it can all go to hell and you can do nothing about it.  

Otherwise I love the theme (being a Pratchett fan) and I think that the game mechanics are a pretty solid base for a competitive area control game, featuring satisfying mechanisms to eliminate your opponent's minions and keep the control over an area.

Love Discworld! And this game is pretty awesome too! What I love about this game is that it requires ZERO knowledge of the books to play. It's got great game play mechanics, it's fun, and can be cut throat at times. If you have read the books it does of course make you chuckle at the cards a little and you get the inside jokes but again it's not necessary as this game really stands on it's own.

Excellent game. Lots of humor (more so if you've read the books), secret roles, cards can give a huge advantage to one player and yet not lead to victory, lots of variety in the replay because of the secret winning conditions. This was a gift based on my love of the books and it turned out to be an amazing game.

Unquestionably good game. Nothing wrong with its design. Fast, fun, tactical without too much of a learning curve. Appeals to new players and experienced gamers alike. No need to know the world, but fans will adore it for that all the more. From a person who actively likes to modify their games to try and establish an ideal sense of balance, there was nothing I could find at flaw with this game beyond it may lack story (which I personally like). But mechanically it is incredibly sound and functional.

Cannot emphasize enough. A must have for any gamer collection.

Surprisingly good game. Knowing nothing of Pratchetts world most of the characters (and therefore humour) was lost on me, but the game is solid enough that that doesn't matter. There's elements of bluffing and misdirection as you try to convince your opponents your secret objective is something other than it actually is, whilst you try to manoeuvre your position to actually win.
High levels of random is partly a shame but also adds to the chaotic, frenetic nature. I really like this one.

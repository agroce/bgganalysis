Not my favorite of the series, and I really can't say why. It seems to play slower than the others and is harder to make connections. Maybe it is because of the north to south linear nature of the map?

RATING: 7.3
This is a very simple game to learn, but it's surprisingly challenging to play.  As you assemble your journey over 10 days (tiles), you have to decide when part of it just isn't working out and abandon it.  The right countries might not come up when you need them, and it can be a long time before you see them again.

Light and straight-forward, this is well worth owning if you can get a good price.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
The small map on the side the the Caribbean islands and all the ferry rides make this game less elegant than the other maps.  The dividing lines between the north and south oceans seem arbitrary they make the game seem more forced unto the map.  Its ok but my least favorite.

I am a fan of the 10 Days in "X" series and I already own Africa and USA.  I just tried this new version out and I really liked it.

The best part is the cruise ships...it adds another option for connecting things together...and it works really well.

The board for this one is a tad bit more confusing than the other games because the Carribbean is in the middle, but then it is blown up down on the bottom...so there is a bit more of "does this work to get to that...?"  But that is the only small quibble I have with the game.

Overall, this is a very good addition to the series and I know I will be playing a lot more of this.

It's wicked how this game with such easy rules can be so hard - and so much fun. You can teach in 3 minutes.
Also, it's a good geography lesson. :)

Edit: Went down from 7 to 6.5 after some more plays as 2-player.
Edit: Played it more times as 3-player. This game works a lot better with 3 and 4 players than with two.
I should probably bump it back up to 7.

Like this one slightly better than 10 Days in Africa, making it my third favorite 10 Days in... game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is a very interesting variation of the "10 Days" series. I like it nearly as well as 10 Days in Africa, though it does seem a bit harder. Being able to chain ships together to form a cruise seems like a good strategy. Generally speaking, countries have fewer connections than the Ten Days In Africa version, so it's a bit harder to reach countries from others, which makes the cruise ships even more important.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.4
A great game for learning the islands and their geographical relationships to one another.  Also, this game is different from the other 10 days we have played--no trains and 5 oceanic divisions that can be connected by cruise ships.  

10 Day in Asia remains our favorite, followed by 10 days in Africa--this one comes in 3rd, due to its educational value, not its play.

Not much new here from the others in the series, and for me that's a good thing.  It's nice to see the western hemisphere represented, it was long over due.  The cruises are new (in that one can link them)  - I suppose this is to offset the lack of double card countries.  

I still enjoy the simple rules, the quick play time, and the light but involved gameplay.  You have to play probabilities and leave avenues open so as not to pigeon hole your trip into the necessity of obtaining one card.  

Nice family-level hand-management game, with an educational value that doesn't sterilize the game play.

The Carribean Sea cards seem to be very important.  But in general, it's very similar to the other 10 Days games.  The major rules difference is that multiple ships can be played in a row.

RATING: 8
Given the stretched out geography of the Americas with Brazil as the single country with many neighbours and many Caribbean islands lined up, I didn't expect too much from this incarnation of the 10 days franchise. But I was positively surprised. By splitting the sea regions and introducing the Panama channel, it's a different type of game. Whoever will set up the sea cruises best, will win. 

It not as good as the best versions (Europe, Asia) but definitely better than Africa or USA which are too simple with the joker transports.

This is fun while being educational. It did take my mom like 5 minutes per turn, but I think she was just being really thorough in making sure she had the best move. I lost.

RATING: 7
At this point it's like they're only making more games to appeal to collectors.  The game plays pretty much the same as all of the others, but the ships are of pretty extreme importance due to all the small islands in the Caribbean.  Like all the others in the series, enjoyable, and just about the right length.  Certainly not a must have, but it's nice and is good to brush up on geography.  Had I paid more attention the last time I played I would have done better in a subsequent game of Smarty Party.

Another nice "10 Days in..." game.  I like the use of ships/oceans from previous games, but don't know that the idea of cruises (chaining ships together without intervening countries) is really in the same spirit as the previous games.  I see why they did it that way, but just think that it breaks one of the underlying rules of the system.

Puzzly fun. Engaged with trying to make a valid route. Randomness in tile draws can drastically effect the outcome, but it doesn't feel too bad to lose. Most people will finish pretty close to each other.

I thought it was better than Asia at first, but now I'm not so sure.  The ability to string oceans is annoying because if the other player gets a lot of oceans it can make it pretty easy for them.

RATING: 4
Just like any other 10 Days, it is a themed version of Racko using geography.  As long as it plays quickly, I can deal with having to play the game, but I will rarely choose to play this one.  Prefer the other 10 days games over this one as this one is too strung out and feels like it takes longer due to the way the continents/countries are located.  Slow going...

RATING: 6.5
Another useful addition to the series. The emphasis in this one is on "cruises"--that is, being able to connect sea voyages from among the Caribbean and separate zones of the Atlantic or Pacific via the Panama canal, to connect between various countries. Otherwise, players can connect by planes in the standard way (between like colors) or by 'foot'--that is, from one country to an adjoining country, or via ferry from adjacent nations. The map has an inset of the Caribbean area, due to all the small island nations therein. Slightly fiddly compared to others in the series, and I think for that reason it hasn't caught on as well with my family.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
Finally...finally a game includes Central and South America and as a bonus you get Canada too! A nice and challenging game of 10 Days. There is a limited amount of colored countries on the board...this seems to make this game a bit of a challenge in connecting plane flights. 
I find this 10 Days to be similar in length and difficulty to that of 10 Days in Asia.
Lately I find myself with an obsessive urge to connect all of the Caribbean countries.

Also, I would have loved to learn all of the island countries (some are missing), but I know this is probably due to creating a very well balanced game. Now it's time for a 10 Days in Australia...hint hint!

Decent entry in the "10 Days.." series, but I prefer the "Europe" version.  "10 Days in the Americas" plays the same, but all the islands, and the enlarged insert map of those islands, isn't as clean a board as Europe, Africa, or U.S. versions are.  I do like the "cruise" rule, though, that you can string together neighboring water areas.  Like all "10 Days.." games, it's more a puzzle than a game, with the board used only for reference as to which countries and bodies of water border on each other or have the same map colors (for thea airplane rule).

My initial thought is that this really is just more of the same from the 10 Days series.  I like the series, so there was little doubt that I would be picking this version up when it became available.  Fortunately, there are some (to me) interesting differences in this edition.  For one, the geography is more elongated/linear than in a lot of the others.  This seems to make some of the connections a little more challenging.  The other interesting difference is how this is addressed.  In this game, the ships can be strung together as a cruise so that you can cross multiple sea spaces between two destinations.  I like this and have considered adding this rule to other versions of the game.  We shall see.  Overall, though, a fine addition to a fine series.  [01/08/2011]

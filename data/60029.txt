A nice solo game, but a little fiddly. I find the game with  hours length a little bit exhausting.

This one is a lot of solitaire fun, rulebook is a bit of a mess but you would come to expect that from a magazine game, but after a while playing you would get the gist of it.

 Juego entretenido, bonito y bien engrasado. Vas aprendiéndolo según lo juegas. Interesante el sistema de vetaranas y novatas. Hay que tapar las entradas laterales para evitar infiltraciones y avanzar despacio. El juego es muy rejugable para ser un juego en solitario. Tan recomendable como la revista.

A fun design, with plenty of options to explore. Game playable in two hours. To make things tougher for the American, remove only one level of fatigue during the overnight turn rather than return the units to their fresh status.

Solo wargame based on area control system. Simple, fun and efficient, it is a good depictation of Hue Battle (to me, the area system is well adapted to urban combat).
I had a lot of fun to play it, up to the point that I reach the limit of this game : when mastered, you can beat the system almost each time.

Not a bad little solitaire game.  Took me awhile to get through the historical scenario - longer than I thought based on a read through of the rules.  There are decisions to be made and you must balance taking ground with getting the nasty "red" hits.  There's also variability with the enemy chit draws and the random events.

great solitaire game in vietnam era, featuring USMC in urban combat. replayability a bit of concern. the component ok but the map is a bit low quality imho ( the material ) and the rulebook is horrible imho. The publisher's online service is horrible and his attitude is unprofessional.

Very good simulation of the first week of fighting in Hue.  Captures and maintains the player's attention.    Excellent graphics and functionality.  Game flow is smooth and rules are clear (with the addition of the minor errata).  Definitely recommended!

Immersive at first, but drags on and becomes a bit of a chore. The rule book isn't that great, but quite functional. The main problem is to figure out what you are sipposed to do and with what (this is where the rules and the set up could have been better), but after that, it seems that you have won the game, unless you give up due to the tedious nature of city block clearing.

RATING: 6
A street to street, house to house simulation in the battle of Hue during the Vietnam War.  I found this game quite clever and right on spot within a magazine game format.  Small, but rich in gameplay.  The map is gorgeously looking on anyone's table with many fine details! 

A quote from the publisher, which in turn is a quote from the movie "Apocalypse" (I believe): "If you ladies leave my island, if you survive recruit training, you will be a weapon. You will be a minister of death praying for war. But until that day you are pukes. You are the lowest form of life on Earth. You are not even human, fucking beings. You are nothing but unorganized grabastic pieces of amphibian shit.""

There are 3 U.S. companies engaged in this search and clear operations.  They would give "orders" to their units to move and fight.  Each company would have different number of orders available from 1 to 3.  After combat in a zone on the map, a zone is then declared as "Clearing Zones", in which all NVA units were eliminated and at least one U.S. unit occupying the zone. The U.S. performs Zone Clearance Test by rolling a die greater than the zone value, ranging form 0 to 4.  Naturally, in those larger areas with many compounds, the zone value is 4.  For small area with clear line of sight or a few forest, the zone value is 0. The most common are 1 and 2.  

A platoon can move over 3 zones - but it cannot move into a zone which is being cleared, nor into a zone which does not contain any platoon being adjacent to an enemy zone.  Enemy zone is specified to be the white, red or green zone which is not controlled by the player with a "US Control Marker".  It is not a very clear and good rule by itself but it is only evident during play when you think of them as places of hidden enemies.  They are subject to attack from the adjacent area of your own.

Combat occurs when your U.S. platoon(s) attack the adjacent enemy zone upon activation.  Up to 3 can attack and what is special here is that each one is assigned to some specific role during the attack: assault, support and reserve, in that order.  The strength of the enemy NVA unit is unknown - it is drawn from a cup. Sounds right for a typical Vietnam wargame?  You bet.  Clear one area at a time and you move forward cautiously.    

Combat is resolved with rolling of 2 dices, with tie giving to an occurrence of a random event.  There are 2 CRTs, one each for U.S. and NVA respectively.  The results are dependent on the total combat strength of the assault and support platoons or the NVA main or remaining combat value and the zone value.  I think the CRT is innovative in the design for integrating two elements at the same time with the result of dieroll, giving rise to the number of hits. Surprisingly, there is no other modifier to the combat dieroll.  

Combat is finished until the NVA unit is eliminated or if all the platoons have a red hit marker.  The NVA unit is returned to the cup if you are not able to hold the zone with a platoon - combat is simultaneous.  The hit ranges from 1 to 3, with the corresponding green, yellow and red hit marker placed on the platoon, indicating its current combat efficiency and weariness.  A red hit platoon has to retreat.  Otherwise, retreat is always voluntary (subject to fire by the NVA upon retreat).  

There are some other rules on reinforcement (actually, there are only a few counters on the map initially and the setup time is only 15 minutes or so) they are coming up by stages), convoys, helicopters, Night Time and a bunch of special rules (guess what, there is gas in use!).  The wounded marines and the unsuccessful rescue of them would cost the players DPs (Yes, you hear it right, not Victory Points but Defeat Points).  There is a historical scenario and an alternative scenario.  The counters are the best from France - colorful and clear with soldier icons with uniform and weapon details; well die-cut and easy to punch.  For the price of a magazine, this is surely a game value for money!

Very good game. Clever implementation of a solitaire system with unknwon enemy units and a certain dose of variable strenght in the US forces ("Untested" vs "tried"). Very good special rules for wounded at start of the battle. Nice loss system. Overall a nice little gem on the first week of the battle in the new city. I would love to see it ported to the entire battle.

It's a fun little game, but I'm not sure he much variety or longevity is in it. The map graphics and counters are very nice, numbs up for that. Game play is quick and pretty straight forward. Establishing a perimeter and then cleaning out the city block by block is quite fun;, although a bit repetitive. drawing chits for resistance, variable length turns and infiltration at night keeps the game interesting.

Unfortunately, the rules need some revision. Read them twice, then start p,aging and read them again. Stuff is not clearly explained or you have to figure it out yourself ('north side of the city', but there's no indication where north is for example). A lot of stuff, like the die rolls for reinforcements should have been printed on the map, not only in the rule book!

Good solitaire game. Engaging at first, but once you get the pattern, your only concern will be the first turns: after the first difficult battles victory is quite easy. I keep playing it from time to time when I'm in the solo mood. Great components!

This is a preliminary rating based on one game. So far I like A Week In Hell quite a lot. The game is different from any other wargame that I have played. All components are beautiful and the game plays smoothly. I find the rules a bit confusing. A Week In Hell is not a difficult game. However, it is easy to come up with questions the rules don't seem to cover. Most rules problems can be solved with common sense. I need to play more to come up with a proper rating.

Fun little system of clearing out the city of Hue street by street and block by block. Maybe grows a little bit repetitive after a few turns.
I like the tension added by needing to fight to get your wounded out of tough situations.
After a few plays I have yet to find a victory for the Americans.

**UPDATE

It's all just turning out to be a bit too procedural and same-samey for my taste. Sort of an uninteresting puzzle with not a lot of worthwhile choices for me. The theme and the difficulty (this is an unforgiving situation) are both things I like a lot. I wish it translated to me having more actual fun while playing it.

RATING: 5
A Week in Hell is interesting enough to try out a few times and work out the best strategy to win. However, there seems to be only one such strategy, and once you've discovered it, playing the game really consists of finding out whether the dice will let you pursue the strategy. If the dice are harsh, you just have to play for a more limited victory (which doesn't mean playing any differently, just playing in the same way but without the chance of winning the game outright) or you have to push your men a little faster (but still follow the same route) or both. Either way, the choice is really made for you.

In addition, at the beginning, sometimes the dice (e.g. when you can't take a space using the MACV or your reinforcements are held up) condemn you to inaction and you just have to give up on the turn and start at the same point next turn. 

The game therefore lacks replayability, but as I said, is a worthwhile way to spend a few hours until you've worked out the strategy.

The magazine is beautifully produced and has some very good articles. On the other hand, others aren't noticeably better than the good online reviews. I think it's great that such a magazine exists, but I haven't been convinced yet that it is something I would buy regularly.

Honestly, I wasn't expecting a lot from this game... heck I thought it was a 2-player until I read the rules.  But you know what?  It really delivers a fun time in a fairly small package.  The components are good and the gameplay rewards careful thinking and methodical process.  I never felt the die rolling to be swingy either.  Well worth the price of admission.  Was a 7, now an 8.

Looking forward to its spiritual successor The Battle of Fallujah from Nuts! Publishing.

[COLOR=#FFFFFF][BGCOLOR=#000000]1P[/BGCOLOR][/COLOR] The game has a great narrative, and I love the whole urban combat theme. Great components and the counters are of the best quality I've seen. The rules are ok, but some areas are a bit unclear or badly translated. The US CRT that is on the map is messed up in the edition I have. This is however not a game breaker. Once you've learned the rules [user=scrub]scrub's[/user] excellent [filepage=53977][/filepage] comes in handy.

Beautiful components.  Abstract, but immerses you in the struggle to control the city.  Quirky, and a little slow going at first.  Once you get the flow of the mechanics, you appreciate how clever and easy is game play.  

Takes a bunch of replays to iron out the optimum tactics (OK, mechanics).  Once you do you probably can't loose.  But, honestly, who enjoys loosing a solitaire game, anyway?

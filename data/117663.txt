GAME: Piraten kapern
RANK: 3345
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Very light dice-rolling game in the Yahtzee mould. Lots of luck involved, but the cards introduce a different challenge each time your turn comes round which keeps the game feeling fresh.

RATING: 7
A fun take on [b]Farkle[/b]-like games.  The cards add some nice variability without increasing complexity much.  Pleasant play, with some interesting decisions.  I'd consider buying this one.

RATING: 6
A really nice filler game, quick to play and lots of fun! Push your luck to the limit! It's too bad that it's not more well known and a bit underrated. It doesn't pretend to be more for what it truly is. A small funny game with dice to pass your time!

It really depends on who you play this with. It can be fun to calculate exact chances of absurd throws, and then sometimes actually making them.

In the flood of average dice games German publishers have been releasing relentlessly for the last couple of years, Piraten Kapern stands out as it offers players new challenges, which makes the game slightly different every time it rolls the table. [i](October 2012)[/i]

[b]Update[/b] - In my game club it’s been a one-season hit, now forgotten: I forgot it way before they did. Thus during my Fall 2015 rating revise I lowered my rating from 7 to 6.

Inclusive the 2017 release mini Promo cards: After the storm and Peace. It is also a good addon for the Stefan Feld game Rum & Pirates.

RATING: 7.5
A pretty fun dice game. I like that you can re-roll any of your "saved" dice to change your strategy halfway through your turn, and the addition of the cards makes this unique for a dice game. The scoring can be very swingy, sometimes rewarding you with 3,500 points in one turn, other times penalizing everyone by 1,000. Playing to 8,000 as the German rules suggest makes the game last too long. 6,000 is a good length.

RATING: 5.5
Multiplayer. Dice rolling, push your luck.
Filler game.

Pros: 
Easy to teach, it's basically Yathzee with a twist.
Dice are good quality and very pretty.
Small and portable.
Good game for bars, if you're not stressed out about accident involving liquid.
Nice theme. 
Nice artwork.

Cons: 
It's basically Yathzee with a twist, not for everyone's taste/mood... nothing really new.


Note: I've mostly played with 9-10 yo children. It's fine, but never my first choice nor tenth...

A quick dice-rolling morsel. If you liked Knatsch, you should definitely give this a go.

An idea I had to make the game "fairer" is to take out the skulls and the double-points cards, because these really seem to unbalance it.

Ended up donating it to a gaming club. Hopefully they'll play it more than I used to.

Pure luck, but more fun with a little variant: don't randomly draw the piracy card but let everyone have 3 cards in hand to choose from, and first roll then choose the card and go on with re-rolls.

First I gave a low rating with "5", because I didn't liked the game after playing with my buddies. To much luck by drawing a good "mission" card, followed again by the luck of the dice rolling... To much for adults...

But now since a few weeks I play this one nearly daily with my little son Oliver. He is five and a-half and is enjoying this little dice game so much. Of course, he still has some problems loosing..., afer some unlucky rolls, but short after he want's to play again..., and again..., and... ;-)

No I updated my rating at least to a moderate "6"! 2014-01

I don't like dice
I don't like games that are mainly about luck
I usually don't like fast/short games

And I don't like this "game".

If you atleast had those cards in hand and be able to use them, but no, you just flip one up each turn...

Dice game with cards that change up each turn a bit. A lot of randomness, mostly push your luck. The dice are really nifty. We thought that the pirate ship cards were a bit unbalanced in that my husband draw several and could never complete them (he had a negative score for half the game). We might try making them optional and see how that affects the game. I thought it was a nice filler pirate game.My husband kinda hated it.

日本語訳を入手できたので、3人で遊んだ。ドクロが3個出るまで振り直せる。最初に引くカードでボーナスがあったり、既にドクロが2個あって泣いたり。一発でドクロ4個出すと他人の点をマイナスできる。

A fine dicegame. Very luckdependant, but that is something I like in a game like this. It is possible to draw a good card and win the game even if the player is behind for many points. Fun and fast. A winner with me and our group.

Played once, didn't have a single "decision". Either rolled 3 skulls and had to pass, or the cards said what I have to do (roll 4+ skulls), while other players got things like "double points".

Quick and fun press-your-luck game, good as a filler. You just throw dice and attempt to make sets of the same symbol, while risking at the same time to lose everything if 3 skulls show up.

This is the kind of game that when you start playing you have to realize that you just need some luck (and guts sometime) with the dice and card you draw. If you can live with that, this can be just fun to play.

the pirate cards make the game *very* random. even for a dice game.
too many turns where you're out after your first roll, without anything to decide.

maybe we'll try a house rule next time: a pirate card is for a round, not only for one player.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
A dull game that quickly turns wretched due the fact that players can cause opponents to lose points.  As I've said umpteen other times, it's never a good idea to include a mechanic that makes a game longer.

Also, playing it safe (i.e., not pushing your luck) makes the game last another infinity minutes, so you can be sure that I will always push my luck.

Short version: Every other dice game that I've ever played is better than this. Truly.

A really good dice game. Lots of randomness but it plays fast enough for this. In bigger groups it can be a bit disappointing when you wait some minutes just to miss your turn by rolling bad. Overall one of the better dice games of 2012 (also a very nice 2-player game!)

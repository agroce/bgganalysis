What a fun game! I played this at a friend's birthday party – there were so many of us we split the table into two teams to play. My husband and I were on one side – which was a terrible idea as we are both master wordsmiths. Sure, the other side had more people, but they didn't stand a chance! What I'd love to do is play this with more balanced teams – say, against my father-in-law, who is a master of words far beyond my husband and I.

PARTY

A word game in which two teams fight over letters. A team can win one or more letters by playing words that move the letters on the street closer to their side. The timer keeps the game moving along. A nice change of pace.

Recommended with 2 and 4-8 players (best 2, 4, 6). 20 mins.

This is my new favorite word game and I can't wait to try this out at a party. For some reason my brain wants to shut down once we were down to a handful of tiles left. There are tons of cards to use and the holder for the cards is nice as well.

My only complaint is that some of the tiles came with small chips in them.

12/21/11 - Tried this as a team game and it went over well. It gets pretty difficult towards the end when there are only a few letters left and the other team is shouting at us while we are trying to think of a word to use.

My word game of choice when faced with the criteria of having something that can host a lot of people (the more the merrier!), has a simple ruleset and keeps things nice and noisy.  Comes with a great set of components: some well thought out cards packed in an excellent caddy, a pretty timer (although I do wish there were two to help with 'downtime'), some beautiful tiles and a very functional insert.

Another word game to look at which all of my friends prefer over this is Last Word (I guess I'm different...).

Fun tug-of-war style word game.  It's definitely better with more than two players.  There's some luck of the cards, but thinking on your feet is still how you're going to win.  I can see the game going on for a long time with teams of equal skill levels, but turns are quick enough that the game moves fast.

RATING: 6
People enjoy languages and thus words, but so many word games devolve to definitions and spelling.  Sure this is also a spelling game, but it favors a depth of vocabulary that permits you to pull the key letters to your side of the street.  That tug-of-war really breathes new life in the otherwise stale word-game genre.  It doesn't hurt that the game is well made and widely available.

In general I avoid word games. It's not that I have a horrible vocabulary, but it just seems like there is always dispute over the validity of words. Not to mention how much people can get annoyed when their vocabulary doesn't match up with the other players. But this game kind of fixes those problems. The categories lead to lots of obvious answers, and the obvious answers can score just as easily as the obscure. Also dividing into teams allows every player to feel involved and avoids singling out one player as the worst. It was actually a fun game, and I liked the tug-of-war aspect. The timer is really short as well, so it keeps the game rolling and stops the teams from spending massive amounts of time debating the best word to use. It is hilarious watching a team go into a round saying things like "We need a word that has a W in it!" and then completely forgetting that once the timer starts. Definitely a good party game. It probably won't go into my Top 10 favorites for parties, but I will often bring it along for something just as social but a little more strategic.

Fun partner word game.   We need to add a house rule where you can't use the same word twice, which started happening near the end of our last game.

This game does bog down at the very end, where players start playing defensively.  A house rule to speed the game up (play one less tile to win) helps fix this.

Fast, easy and very funny game. It is always surprising to discover the smart side of a game while playing it : whereas at first, the teams are looking for the longer word, quickly, the game is more "strategical" as you focus on specific letters which have to be brought back on your side. The themes are nice and the timer is just short enough to keep pressure on the players.

RATING: 6
It's a word game in which players perform a tug-of-war over consonants.  Players can play individually or establish teams.  Someone draws a card, reads a question or phrase, and then the active player has 60 s (?I may be wrong about the time) to come up with a word to answer.  As the player spells the word, consonant tiles are pulled a step in their direction.  It takes 3 steps, total, to pull a tile off the board on your side from the neutral middle row.  Once the tile is off, it is yours to keep.  First player to 8 tiles wins the game.  Fast and fun.

RATING: 7
Fun word game!  We played as a party game tonight with mixed ages and it worked very well.  The 30 second timer runs out much faster than you'd think, so there's not much wiggle room to sit and figure out the optimum word - not only must you come up with your word, but each team must also spell it and move the tiles before time runs out (any letters not moved will not count).  We played the easy side of the cards since we had kids playing the game too - the hard side looks like it could be pretty difficult given the time constraints.  Looks like it could be a very fun game with 2 players -- less negotiating between players for the "best" word should move the game along more quickly.  Recommended!

Components: Great chunky letter tiles with unique street sign symbols as backgrounds that help to differentiate the letters. We might go through twenty cards or more in a single game, but the game comes with loads of double-sided cards, so I expect the replay value to be high. Also, the same cards, but shuffled, could still lead to fresh games.

Experience: Fun. The timer keeps the pressure on, to brainstorm, decide, and move the tiles before the timer runs out. I enjoy how at the beginning of the game we're trying to think of strategically long words, but toward the end, we are targeting specific letters, and therefore throwing out perfectly good word ideas in favor of tiny words that contain the letter we need.

Two things could improve this game. 1) A time limit. The game outstays its welcome, especially as we easily fight over the same couple of letters at the end, without making any progress. 2) Clearer rules about challenges. Our group is contentious and had varying interpretations of the criteria to fit in a category, and whether we could just reuse the same word the other team had, so long as it fit the category.

2 players/teams. Fun "tug-of-war" game using letters. I would recommend 2 to 3 players per team tops. There is a very limited amount of time to pick a word and spell it out and having more people can make coming to a consensus challenging without picking a very decisive team leader.

I always appreciate a game that can scale to any number of players equally, so this is a good one to have as it plays well from 2-player matches all the way up to a full-blown party game. As with all word games, those armed with the better vocabulary do best, but the simple battle over the letter tiles makes for a very fun game.

Great party game, but it won't work for all groups. Many of the categories are semi-ambiguous or are open to questionable answers, so keep Wikipedia handy and be prepared to argue. If that won't fly with your group, then avoid. But if a knock-down drag-out over whether a steeple qualifies as "something that has a bell" will lead to giggles instead of fisticuffs, then you'll enjoy this. We do.

It should be noted that the components are of excellent quality and should hold up well to extensive play.

There seemed like too much going on too quickly to make a great decision each time (at least with two players). I often finding myself blurting out a word which fit the category but didn't help my letter situation. Then having to spell it correct in a pinch of time was kind of annoying.

Great game idea though, and as such I do respect the concept. But for my money, I'll keep my copy of scrabble and simply use those tiles to recreate the game.

[2 plays] Played this first with 2 players, and thought it was pretty decent, but had potential to really shine with a larger group.  I had seen a group playing it, and it seemed like a very party-gamey word game.  So then I played the second time with a group, and it was a bit disappointing.  I think the problem is that it's a timed game in which each side, on their turn, has a fixed amount of time to agree on a word and put it in play.  This can be very active and interesting if all the players on your side are (a) equally good at thinking of suitable words, and (b) equally fast and assertive about putting their suggestions forward.  But if those conditions are not met, it's the sort of cooperative effort that can easily degenerate into being led by one person.  I guess this game does have potential to be fun with a group, but would be very dependent on the right circumstances.

A thought-provoking word game that's sometimes more brain burning than fun. Be careful not to play with those who are too strict when assessing whether a word fits the current category. "Too strict" being a subjective point reached whenever you're not having fun anymore. Players are always split into two teams so it scales well as long as one player does not overpower his teammates. A nice two player game for evenly matched players.

fun, quick little game. good for 2 players, but would probably be better with 4.  We enjoyed playing this one. I was worried because neither my husband or I are strong in vocabulary, but this was very user friendly.  High quality board and pieces.  The only thing I didnt like was the omission of certain letters. While I understood why they didn't use vowels, why the heck isnt there a J?! I wanted to use that so many times!!...Oh well :) I will want to play this again sooner rather than later!!

This is a great party/family game. Playing in teams is a lot of fun, with everyone yelling out words and trying to decide which one to use, but you better be quick, because you only have 30 seconds to do so.

The tiles in this game are made out of a thick ceramic type of material. They are really nice and big and easily readable. Game play is quick and lots of fun.

We played a fun game today called "Word on the Street."

It is part word game (finding words with the letters you need) and part area control game (moving as many letters to your side of the street as possible).

We divided into 2 teams.  First, a team draws a category card.  Then that team tries to think of a word that fits into that category and has letters that will bring them the biggest advantage.  The board is a street with 5 lanes and two road sides.  All the letter pieces (except vowels, J, Q, X and Z) are lined up in the center lane.  Each letter from your team's chosen word moves that letter piece one column closer to your team's side of the road.  Once you move a letter onto to your team's side of the road, you get to keep it.  First team to get 9 of the 17 letter pieces onto their side of the road wins!

I find this game fun and exciting, especially if the game comes down to a close finish!  It is a medium/light game that both regular and casual board game players will enjoy.

Word on the Street is a word/party game that's great for casual groups because of the easy rules, fast play, and chunky plastic resin tiles. The snappy 30-second timer is the perfect length for the game, giving your team enough time to come up with something, but not enough time to feel like you've got the best possible answer. Word on the Street is just the right length. Playing to 8 tiles means that there will always be at least three tiles to pursue, even when the game is tied 7 to 7. The designer has wisely excluded all the vowels (too easy) and the toughest consonants J, Q, X, and Z.

I do have a few criticisms, but each comes with an easy solution.

Issue #1: I think the number of categories supplied is too few. It will only take about a dozen plays to go through all of them. The publisher could have easily put four categories on each card instead of two. If you play the game often, you may feel that you've already thought of the optimal words for many of the categories. Solution: there will be an expansion with more categories. Really, though, it would be easy to get more categories from a thrifted copy of Scattergories, Facts in Five, Last Word, Outburst, etc.

Issue #2: there is a very strong first-team advantage. Solution: allow the second team to pull a certain number of tiles one space toward their side before starting. Three tiles sounds about right.

Issue #3: some players won't like the rule that allows the other team to taunt and distract the active team. Solution: play without this rule if it's a bad fit for your group.

Nice idea. Susceptible to arguments about which words qualify for which categories, and I think to avoid foregone conclusions ("is there anything we can do to stop them winning next turn?) requires more foresight than most people want to expend on a party game, even serious gamers. But it's fun despite that.

A game in which the element of time becomes much more important, because both brainstorming a word and scoring it must take place before the 30 second timer finishes.

Also, unlike many word games, it is interactive and quick to play, definitely punshing AP prone players.

Being erudite doesn't matter so much as grabbing the right letters at the right time, and knowing easier words with multiple letters is rewarded.

Quick, fun, vocabulary-based, interactive, works with different numbers on teams- this is a really good little word game.

Needs more category cards.  We burn through ~50% each time we play.  Even if we flip cards, that means it repeats every 5 games, which is a lot for the type of game it is.

Might be better to just play to seven letters.

Interesting idea for a team word game where you come up with words for a card category in an attempt to move letter tiles which sit on the game board (the consonants only) towards your side of the "street" before the other team moves the letter all the way to their side. Move 8 letters to your side first and you win. Sounds good but seems to fall a little flat in practice.

Originally saw this demoed at Origins, but didn't get to demo it myself and didn't buy it.  It wasn't until a couple of months later that I got to play it.  My first experience was a frustrating one, but not because of the game.  We were at a party, and a few people decided they didn't want to play.  Nevertheless, they interfered with the game by calling out words that matched the cards.  But that didn't manage to turn me off of the game.  It's not a bad party/word game, and the game bits are of very high quality.  With the wrong crowd, I could see how the game could devolve into arguing about the words and their appropriateness for the categories, but that kind of problem is not unique to this game.

Too much controvery with no good way to break ties.  One example from our play was something like "a family relationship" and one side answered step-daughter-in-law.

Dictionaries are not helpful because the controversy is not about the spelling but rather about whether an answer qualifies.  And because the range of questions cover very different areas, there is no definitive source that you can use to answer.  Even wikipedia was not enough.

The concept of the game is fun, and it probably would be okay with the right group of people who were not playing to win at any cost.

Move letters toward your edge if you answer card with word involving those letters. Tug of war with letters.  For word-game fans: Not much depth. Basically just a casual game of dueling vocabulary, but enjoyable enough if playing with another of equal knowledge of words. The letters are bakalite and the board is sturdy--the best part! Not a bad family game with children though (7.5)

Didn't really get the hype behind this game. The timer isn't quite enough time to settle on a word AND move all of the tiles, so we started giving 30 seconds to decide on a word and THEN they can move their tiles if they haven't already. It takes about 5 minutes to get all but maybe 4 letters off the board...the other 20-something minutes is moving those last few letters back and forth in a seemingly never-ending game of tug of war. We played with 4 but it may be more fun with more people to shout or think of better words.

Challenging party game with easy to explain rules, that works well with a large number of players.

Prefer the blue cards as they tend to be a bit more specific categories result in a better balanced game.

Figured there was a game in here, and it turns out there is. Fun even with 2 to experiment with, but forget the timer in that case and just move as quickly as you can.

Would probably benefit by having 2 timers so you don't have to wait for it to finish. Don't play with poor spellers in any case.

Great fun for a party game, with more strategy than most will probably expect. (rcvd free, but would buy)

There are bunch of consonants down the center of board and you are given some time to come up with an answer to a word.  For every letter that is on the board in your word, you move it one step closer to your side.  If you get it all the way over you claim the letter.  The team with 8 claimed letters wins.

It is an ok party game.  I find it somewhat fun, but those players with strong vocabularies (older players) are going to beat the ones without (younger kids).  It is a good family/party game, but one that I would play from time to time.

Probably a GREAT game for the convention.

NB: Some reviewers get bored of this. Some say it's a great party game (which it seems to be). DEFINITELY requires a knowledge of English spelling. Topics could probably be drawn from Scategories.

I bought this game because one of my friend loves word games, who would have guessed my other friends would get into it also.  
Such an easy concept, but makes you think.  
Great with 2 players, and great with 2 teams.

The timer aspect of racing to spell a word before the time runs out is great.  Really gives it the extra tension and fun.  You start second guessing your spelling...lots of laughs.

This is a game for non-gamers & gamers alike.  This is the game scrabble should have been.

Game in a Nutshell: Two teams work together to claim letters by choosing words based on categories that use them in its spelling. 

Played as: 8 player

Pros: A unique twist on a word game. The presentation is great as you see the push and pull for each letter. Simple in its premise but some interesting offense/defense choices you need to make on the fly (using a word that might secure some letters you want, or another that might pull them away others that your opponents are close to getting... or just go wild and pick a word that grabs at as many letters possible!). I like that the timer is short and keeps the game flying.

Cons: I found spelling to be an issue, and since you have to spell things while the timer is ticking, it becomes clunky to deal with. True to any word game, some people are going to be stronger at it than other based on vocabulary and how quickly they can bring things up in the mental index.

Other: In honesty, I gave this a pretty decent rating when you consider the game is tied to two personally strong negative associations... a party game, and a word game. So for what it is, it's a pretty strong one. Also, I saw a giant version of this being played at a CON with pizza boxes on taped out floor grid. The physical running up and down the grid moving letters looked both ridiculous and exactly the way I'd want to play should I ever have the option.

Best Use: A classic party game for the family over the holidays.

A cute word spelling game where common letters start in the middle of the street.  A card is flipped and the team whose turn it is comes up with a word that is an answer to the card that utilizes as many letters on the street as possible.  If spelled correctly for every time each letter appears in the word it is moved one space closer to that team.  If passes over the board, the team gets that letter and play continues.

The game is a bit of a tug of war, but it is fun with adults when drinking, and I am sure I will play this game with my kids when they get a bit older.

Team-based word game.  Teams try to win letters (all consonants) by dragging the letter tiles across the lanes of the street when spelling words that use those letters.  The first part of the game was fun and quick, but after most of the letters were gone, it really bogged down.  The game should probably end after a certain number of letters are claimed.

I generally like word games, but this one didn't really appeal to me.  It was pretty interesting in the beginning, when there were plenty of letters to compete for, so coming up with creative words was fun.  Toward the end, though, when there were only a few letters left that both sides kept pulling back and forth, the game really dragged on.  It becomes pretty repetitive when both sides are just moving the same letter back and forth over and over again.  Additionally, I wasn't a big fan of the team play; surely they could have applied this concept to more than 2 players.

As someone who manages a circulating board game collection at a public library, I believe that Word on the Street is an essential game that every library should own and lend to its patrons. The design is flawless, and the game can accommodate a broad range of players, be taught in less than a minute, and contains durable and simple components. It's on my Want to Buy list because it's rarely available to check out at the library. It's an awesome family game, party game, and couple's game--everyone should own it.

A fun word game with an emphasis on thinking of words quickly instead of thinking of obscure words. I like the strategic element introduced by the tug-of-war with the letters, where you really want to think of a word that not only fits the category but also pulls a particular letter all the way over to your side or pulls one back that your opponents have almost captured.

The end game can feel a bit silly when there are only a few letters left, but I like that the feel of the game changes as it progresses. At the beginning you mostly want words with lots of letters, but toward the end you only care about words with lots of one of the few remaining letters.

I didn't really like this word game. Trying to come up with a word and spell it out in the time allotted that would give your team the most points just wasn't very fun to me. The worst part though is how towards the end of the game there are so few letters that matter that you really have few words that can work. This means that the early game is the most interesting, and the end of the game you just really want it to be over. The best games in my opinion have rising action and the climax of the game is right near or at the every end. Word on the Street manages to be the exact opposite where the best parts are right at the start and you just have less and less fun as the game continues.

An interesting wordgame that might get even more interesting with more players (i.e. Team Play). We played it back to back as a 2-Player game and it had the tendency to drag on towards the end with only a handful letters going back and forth. The basic idea is very cool but I found that some if not most of the cards are a bit bland and not very creative. For example, instead of making one side easy and hard ( Actually, I found the easy ones much harder than the hard ones ), they could have made one side regular questions (A mammal) and the other side crazy/fun questions ( A stupid Halloween costume etc.). 

Still, a neat family / word game

[b]Second best find-a-word-that-fits-a-category game[/b] next to [gameid=14151]

Nothing to write down! Not even scores!

Rare for this kind of game: You have to find words that fit a category and contain certain letters, not just begin with a particular letter.

Subtle strategies involved: Do you focus on quickly bringing letters to your side or play defensively to move letters on your opponent's side?

I only played this with two but I'm assuming it will just be as fun, perhaps even more fun, at higher player counts.

Some minor things, though:
* We used a timer on a phone instead of the sand timer as it made it easier to reset the timer ... often, you don't need your full 60s.
* You will go through the category cards fast; you'll go through almost half the deck in one game. I don't know how this will affect replayability, though

I suck at spelling. The end. I enjoy this more than scrabble, but my neighbor whom I usually play with is a vocabulary/spelling fiend. He knows exotic cheeses, long dinosaur names, obscure words that use almost any letter in any category, etc. Playing 2v2 isn't much fun because of disagreements on word choice with only a 30 second window to pick a word and spell it. These two things basically make the game unenjoyable for me. If I played 1v1 with someone of my level it would probably be a 6.5

An interesting twist on the word/spelling/party game concept.  The idea is good, but the execution leaves something to be desired.  Not really sure what I wanted... maybe better balance in the cards?  Maybe a little more time so you weren't only picking one of the first 3 words you thought of?  Or maybe a less uniform board so the common letters took more work to win (and weren't gone after the first few turns) and the harder letters were easier.  Fun, but not the best.

We recently pulled this game back out after it had been packed away for a little while, and we literally spent five minutes gushing about how we had forgotten just how great of a game this truly is.

We typically play is as a two player game, but would love to someday try it as a team game (I imagine the time constraint may get a bit tricky though, as I consider myself to be doing well if I think of a decent word on my own within the 30 second time limit, without throwing in the element of debate/brainstorming! But I'm sure the team way is fun too.)

Pros:

-You learn it in minutes. (This is not an exaggeration. Literally like two minutes tops.)

-Simple, brilliant concept. There are some basic elements of strategy - for instance, you can focus on offense (e.g. trying to pull off letters that are close to your side) or defense (e.g. trying to move letters that are close to your opponent's side more closely to the middle), or some combination of the two (or neither, and just try to go for long words!)

-There is a fun speed element in that, even if you think of a word within your time frame (but towards the end of it...), you still have to squeeze in enough time to (correctly!) spell the word, and move each tile one-by-one as you do so. This stage sometimes takes longer than you might expect, depending on how your spelling skills tend to be! ;) Having said this- this game, or the Junior edition, would be great ways for kids / young adults to practice spelling out loud!

-Quality game construction - tiles are solid, game board and box are sturdy, instructions cover many relevant scenarios (while still being simple to follow the overall concept), etc.

Cons:
 
-As with all games of this nature (Scattergories, etc.), yes, there is the potential for debatable answers. We try to just be reasonable and err on the side of only saying answers that clearly fit the chosen category, no question, since the constant debate can get a bit exhausting.

-I'm of the opinion that if you need to put out an expansion pack so quickly (as it seems this game did), you maybe should have just thrown in those extra cards to begin with. After about 8-10 plays, you'll have gone through the cards, both sides. Yes, you can replay them (though it's not quite as fun when the same old categories keep coming up), but I'd suggest just buying the bundle (if you are buying from Amazon) that includes the original game plus the expansion pack cards if you feel pretty comfortable that you're going to enjoy the format.

We consider this to be one of the most underrated gems of the board games we own - if you enjoy word games, definitely give it a whirl!

Bought in like new condition from Goodwill. Pretty awesome group or party game.  Family loved it.  Teams can theoretically have unlimited numbers of people, but I think 3-4 per team is a good number here.  I'm not a huge word game fan but this games presents a different take with trying to secure letters by coming up with the most creative and longest words for each clue. The back and forth between teams at the end gets really fun.  Only problem with this game is it needs more cards as you can go through all the topics in three to four games.  Then it gets repetitive using the same words over and over.  May have to track down the card expansion soon.

A competitive team based word game where you need to build words to move and capture letters. Interesting letter-shifting mechanic generally requires each team to counteract the other to prevent them from accumulating 8 letters for victory. "May the team with the best vocabulary win!"...actually this is one game where that is not entirely true. While it may helpful, we've found that teams assembling long/complex words quickly (which counteract the other teams matching letters) tend to win the lion's share of games. Boring box art, but with a solid game inside...if you like word games, give it a shot.

Haven't played it as a party game yet, but the 2 player version is very good if players are pretty evenly matched.  It's kind of a like a cross between Word Whiz and A to Z, played as a tug-of-war.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Nice components- tiles are solid (bakelite?)
Early game is fun with a lot of letters in play, but game drags toward the end with the same letters being pushed back & forth across the "street" (board).  I'd recommend it for folks who like word games. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.9
Components - .6/1 Box feels large for what's included in the game. Cards feel sort of flimsy. Tokens for the letters are nice solid weight (don't easily get bumped around, which is a big plus).

Fun - .8/1 This is probably my favorite word based game. Sadly, I'm not entirely sure why.

Replayability - .7/1 There are a lot of cards, (with two levels of difficulty) but they do get a little samey in nature after awhile. As long as you aren't marathoning the game, you'll hardly notice.

Strategic - .8/1 For a word game, there is more strategy than anticipated. Not only do you want to get a long word, but you need to balance what letters are available versus what letters you want to secure versus what letters you need to prevent your opponent(s) from securing. In addition, the timer ensures that you have weigh all of these options in a short amount of time. I believe this game scales to 6-8 well because you're more likely to come up with a good word, but you don't have enough time to go through a whole lot of debate. Basically everyone says their best and you go with it (avoid any bickering)

Theme - .6/1 Probably a little high on the rating, but the visual is done well, and being a word game, I'm not sure there is a great way to incorporate any real theme into the game. 

Personal Rating - 3.5/5 I'm not a big fan of word games, though I've played my fair share. This is definitely my favorite, and I'll generally play whenever the wife is looking for one (she definitely likes them a lot). We have similar vocabularies and spelling ability, but she generally wins due to the fact she comes up with the words under the gun much quicker.

RATING: 6.5
A quick, fun party tug-of-war word game for 2 teams. There's even a bit of strategy -- do you go for the quick score, or try to prevent the other team from scoring? Makes you think of long, interesting words that include whatever particular letters you are trying to move! Not so good, however, with people who don't like words (in fact, not much of a "party" playing with them!).

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
Teams sit across from each other, with the board in between. The board has most letters of the alphabet (no vowels, and some others also missing?) in the boulevard of a street. Teams take turns flipping a category card and coming up with a single word within that category -- within 30 seconds. Each occurrence of a letter in that word moves the letter one space towards the team, until the letter is off the board (it never returns). The first team to collect 8 letters wins!

RATING: 6
I have to start out by saying how impressed I am with the components in this game.  There's not much to it but what is there is really good quality.  The tiles especially are thick, heavy, chunky pieces of plastic.  You know a game has good components when you could bludgeon someone to death with them.  And the deck of cards has a divider to keep track of your place in the deck!  Such a simple little thing but one I can't believe I've never seen in a party game until now.  With multiple people playing a game and putting it away it's not always so easy to just move a card to the  back of the deck to remember your spot and this is one simple piece of card-stock that solves that problem.  Bravo Out of the Box Publishing!

The game itself is a fun little party game and it is played as two teams which I tend to like a little better in a party game than free-for-all scoring.  Each team takes turns drawing a category card, coming up with a word in that category, and pulling letters toward their side of the board.  Then the other team does the same playing tug-o'-war with the letters until one team claims 8 of them.

This has been a BIG hit eash time i've gotten it out with random groups of people.  Someone always wants to buy themselves a copy after I show it to a new group.
WARNING:  This game can inspire intense competition.
If the group likes trivia or is more analytical, play "Wits and Wagers".

A solid word/party game that scales well to more players than you could fit into a game of Scrabble. I appreciate that having a large vocabulary -- rather than a Scrabble vocabulary -- is useful, though the ability to spell is required.

There's not a lot of drama or excitement to it, though, so you're never going to tell stories about the great time you had playing. It's an accessible, undemanding diversion that works well with non-gamers.

Gave my copy to my sister.

Neat idea, good length.  Some of the categories are giveaways (e.g., Rivers = MiSSiSSiPPi), and suggested game end (i.e., 8 letters) can leave teams fighting over only 4 letters, which is really hard.

[Out of the box 2009 edition] {Party, word; player-elimination, word-building} Word on the Street is a simple family / party game.  It's short and fun.  Recommended.

The quality of the game is good.  The board is study.  The tiles are thick and sturdy.  It is nicely illustrated.  I wish that the category cards had graphics, rather than a dull word.

The category cards are more tuned to Westerners, and may not really fit Chinese.

This is a team game that borrows a little from [thing=2381][/thing].  The board is set up with tiles of all the consonants in a line in the middle of 5 rows.  You are given a category and have to name a word that matches the category.  For each letter in the word, you move the appropriate tile one row towards your team and if you ever move the tile off the board you lock that letter for your team.  You win if you lock 8 tiles.

It's a pretty standard word game, but gets bonus points for being a team game.  A couple twists are that you have a timer and have to both choose a word and move all of the tiles before the timer runs out.  If you spell the word wrong the other team can challenge to negate the word.  Good game, but pretty standard fare within the word genre.

This is a pretty neat word game. I hate hate hate the taunting rule. With the taunting rule I may give this game a 3 or 4. 

The game is not hilarious, nor is it a tug of words. The concept is pretty novel, and the game is easy to teach to others so gamers and non-gamers alike can play easily.

RATING: 6.5
Good party game for fast thinking wordsmiths. Definitely like how you can mix old and young players and they complement each other nicely. Perfectly functional components. The timer is just fast enough to apply a lot of pressure on each team. Better think for only 15 seconds as it sometimes takes a while to spell it (with younger players).

As with most party games, I've adjusted the rules to suit my groups needs. With the adjustments this game plays well as a 2 or 4 player game. Undecided with all the yelling and accusation of misspelling with big groups on the original rules.

Rules Used:
Added Pen and Paper. Both teams go at the same time writing down possible answers. One of them has to be circled before the time runs out.

Highly recommend playing till 6 letters at the most, maybe even 5.  It was highly competitive, my wife who hates word or spelling games got into the game.  However, getting the 7th letter took a while and the 8th took forever.  The 7th and 8th letters was half the game and it was a slow paced tug of war that was boring.

I didn't expect much from this, but I was impressed by my initial plays of Word on the Street. It's not just a different way of playing Scattergories - it's tense power struggles and a surprising amount of tactical play for a word/party game. Not for a group that doesn't like speed or intensity, because this has those in spades.

Gifted this to my parents and we've enjoyed it so much that my wife found us our own copy. Again, I love word games, and this is a great group word game. It truly is a Tug of Words. My wife and I enjoy that it plays well with 2 players. When playing multiple games of it in the same evening it practically requires a house rule of "no reusing words from previous plays of the game today".

To set up the game, seventeen letter tiles (all the consonants in English other than j, q, x, and z) are placed in a strip down the center of the game board – the median strip of the street, if you will, which has two "traffic lanes" on either side of it. On a turn, one team is presented with a category such as "types of fruit" or "something a player is wearing", and that team has thirty seconds to come up with an answer in that category, then move the letters in that word toward their side of the game board. Any letters in the word that are not on the game board are skipped. If the answer were "pineapple", for example, the team would move P, N, P, P and L.
If a team moves a letter off the game board, it has claimed that letter and that tile will not move for the remainder of the game. The first team to claim eight letter tiles wins!

Not a bad game, but the rules are just a little too...vague. We played this game with 4 players in teams of two and while we had a great time laughing and enjoying ourselves, some of the words were way too undefined. For example, a semi-automatic is valid for "things sold under a black market".... doesn't sound quite right. also, special words and phrases in diseases...etc.
Still a decent party game with the right folks.

For a word game, it's not that bad, but it falls into the problem of the endgame taking a lot longer than necessary, as players are working on getting the last few letters into their collected area.  The back-and-forth gets a little tedious.  In addition, the rule of putting something up to vote seems ridiculous, since the teams are supposed to be even, and the teams will obviously vote in favor of their own answers.  So while it's not that bad, it's not that great either.  It gets a solid MEH from me.

I'm not really into party games, but this one has a pretty good gimmick. Basically a tug-of-war word game, it works well as a 2 player game and equally well with a larger group divided into teams. Players are given a category and they must come up with a word that fits, pulling a letter tile to their side for each instance of that letter appearing in the chosen word. The first team to pull a set amount of tiles to their side wins. It's fast, fun, easy to teach...and no longer in my collection because I simply don't play party games. If you like this sort of thing though, you could do a lot worse.

An absolute blast.  Fantastic party game.  Great family game.  Tug of war has never been so fun!

As a party game, it can get loud.  Trash talking is encouraged, so when it is your turn, expect to get yelled at.  :)  

As a family game, it's fun to watch teammates discuss (at times argue) over the best word to use on the board.

As a two player game, it becomes a contemplative chess match.

Pretty board.  Simple set of rules.  Small footprint.  A winner in every respect of gaming.

An entertaining lighthearted semi-party game. One of the better types of word games that relies on generic topics, then having the players come up with words that fall into that category.

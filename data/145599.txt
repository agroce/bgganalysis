RATING: 10
As my kids (5 & 9) are familiar with the "Monkey King" stories (as I am from HK), they love the game! They even play among themselves without me ...

While the rules are relatively simple, you need to have a bit planning on the strategy after the early scenarios. Should be perfect if the miniatures were painted (as i missed the kickstarter) ...

I own that game because i love the story Journey to the west.
the quality of the component are really good and the gameplay is fun enough to play all the campaign. The future expansion would complete that story if marrow Production finally put it on the market.

This looks great.  Lots of rules info is public and the game looks really good.  Lots of strategy and replay value.

Feels very tactical.  A lot of the attack part of the game has to do with movement and facing.  I like the cleanse/don't cleanse choice as it can strongly impact the game if you fail a cleanse.  Basically, it's another, important tactical choice as you play.  Although the rulebook is mired in minutiae, the rules themselves are actually very straight-forward and intuitive.  Easy to learn, easy to play, easy to enjoy.

Quality of board/pieces is off the charts!  The minis are GORGEOUS.  I'm a fan of nice plastic, and this is nice plastic.  Only dicey element is the sliders on the character cards, but that I can work with.  Overall, excellent quality of bits!

By the way, kudos to Marrow for the AMAZING packaging of the GORGEOUS minis.  They are safe, secure, and storeable as is, without any further consideration.  Yes, the box is (much) larger because of this, but the minis are safe and that's great by me.

This game has the most stunning miniatures in my collection so far ! Game play is quite good also. I feel like playing Zombicide with another gorgeous theme and different movement rules which make you really have to co-operate with your partners. You can feel the intensity when lots of demons spawn onto the map.The only thing I don't like is there are some demon miniatures when you put them close together their base couldn't stand within the grids since the upper parts expand to much. In general, it's top-notch and I really enjoy the game.

What an extraordinary game.  Marrow Production has taken the Journey to the West story and really done something special with it.  Amazing component quality with some outstanding miniatures.... Miniatures to even rival those of Kingdom Death.  Gameplay is strategic, difficult, challenging and always fun with a gripping story that made me want to keep playing for hours... Whole group enjoyed this game! Really hope to see more from Marrow!!!

After thoroughly playing through this game, it's become boring and clunky. However, what you get from this game is impressive. Tons of highly detailed figures and excellent art work. The figures come in their own storage box for easy storage/care, instead of them getting tossed around in the box.

El juego engaña, he visto muchas copias a la venta y creo que es porque las dos primeras misiones son bastante flojas. Yo me pegé un gran susto al jugarlas, porque no es que sea un juego barato. Ahora, que una vez llegas a la tercera partida ahi si lo flipas! Juegazo en serio. Podeis ver como es en mis videos, pero en serio que es de los mejores juegos que tengo. No solo no lo vendo sino que me he estado moviendo para conseguir los extras, cuando los envien claro! Eso da un poco de miedo, la verdad es que no se si llegarán a enviarlos, espero que si, porque es un juego del que me gustaría tener todo.

Minis are awesome but gameplay is very 'eh'.  Was hoping for a lot more out of it.  Quests seem rather weak, wanted more flavor or something.  Kind of a Zombicide feel.

1st ever KS. Pls be great. :)

"I am the Greatest! Will you Demons never understand!" 
"Get ready to fight!" *

* from the delightful UK dubbed (Andrew Sach's? and someone and another.....2) Monkey!
What a great mixture of cheesey voice dubbing/funk music and eastern esoteric/philsophic thought. damn it nostalgia.

 Though the Marrow version is more edgey graphically. Seeming to be to the end of the scale of say Katsuya Terada's graphic novel (beautifully drawn but too heavy an interpretation in aspect for me). Though Monkey as a sort of a Demon himself is a fair and interesting slant on the thing. 
Skirmishy type games do appeal to me a bit I can't help myself. Glad to seemingly have the option to pick and choose so many diferent aspects potentially for what you want to use in your own game. I will most likely put my own slant on painting the models if I get chance. The sculpts are looking nice I feel so far but I would love to make my set my own. I'll have to see but I may have to go for more naturalistic colours at times and subtly mod weapons and poses. Liking the scenery a bit too.

Altogether a stunning solo experience. Pure and surprisingly very well crafted game design, I played through all scenarios and I could probably describe it as a combination of Descent and solo Chess with the most stunning miniatures ever made! Thank you, Marrow, hope you'll have success you deserve in this weird and sort of degenerated market :)

Gorgeous game with exquisite miniatures in a Chinese mythology setting. The online pictures don't do justice to how detailed and lovingly crafted the minis are. 

Gameplay is simple enough to be accessible to my 8 year old, yet tactical enough to keep adults engaged. 

It is designed for solo or full cooperative play for up to 4 players, but I prefer to have one play the role of the Demon "overlord" with some house rules for added tactical depth.  

Thank you Marrow Production for translating my childhood legends onto the table top in such a beautiful and engaging way! I will be getting all the expansions once they are released.

Would really like to support the Kick starter but I don't like the long delivery time and I am still waiting on 13+  other KS items to hopefully eventually show up.
I will get this game if it ends up being produced and on the market in stores, looks really cool with a unique game system and love Adrian Smiths artwork as well.
Ordered the game from their store with free shipping but still a very expensive purchase since the CAD $ is doing so bad ouch.

Should've done the Kick starter, oh well. I ended up paying a lot more then I wished but it is a fantastic looking game, excellent quality look forward to playing soon.

Only a few scenarios in so far, but having a lot of fun with it. The rules and stats are simple, but the different combat patterns create an interesting tactical experience. Each scenario so far has presented an interesting and exciting puzzle, and all of the characters are fun to play.
The pray/meditate actions do seem problematic; meditating is really not worth it!

13 month delay on wave 1 with a severe lack of communication the first 10 months of the delay or so. Haven't received it yet despite some online stores now having it in stock.

Absolutely no word on wave 2. Rulebook not totally clear, and very hard to get a response from Marrow productions about anything. 

Buy it if you only care about the gorgeous minis.

I bought my copy used so my rating is not biased due to KS frustration.  The minis look awesome and the rest of the components are nice.  The theme runs heavy throughout the game.  Gameplay is average for this type of game and movement is clunky (few movement points and slow since no diagonal movement at all).

A simple trick taking game where you try to avoid taking cards. Easy to teach and play. Fast moving. 

Πολύ απλό τραπουλοπαίχνιδο με μπάζες, όπου προσπαθείς να πάρεις όσο το δυνατόν λιγότερα φύλλα άρα και πόντους. Ο πρώτος παίχτης ρίχνει ένα νούμερο (από 1 έως 54) και ο επόμενος καθορίζει αν πρέπει όλοι να πετάξουμε μεγαλύτερα ή μικρότερα φύλλα από αυτό. Όποιος απομακρυνθεί περισσότερο από το νούμερο του πρώτου παίκτη μαζεύει την μπάζα. Εκτός και αν κάποιος δεν έχει να ρίξει σωστό φύλλο οπότε χάνει και τα μαζεύει αυτός. Αν στο τέλος της γύρας κάποιος έχει 100 πόντους τότε το παιχνίδι τελειώνει και νικητής είναι αυτός με το μικρότερο σκορ. 
 
Όπως είπα είναι πολύ απλό και γρήγορο χωρίς να θέλει πολύ σκέψη. Βοηθάει που δεν έχει χρώματα αλλά μόνο νούμερα. Παίζει μέχρι 6 άτομα και κρατάει κάνα 20λεπτο οπότε λειτουργεί σαν φιλεράκι και δείχνει να αρέσει σε casual παίκτες. Τώρα γιατί έχει διαβολάκια και όχι αγγελάκια ή μπισκοτάκια δεν ξέρω. Μάλλον θεώρησαν ότι θα βοηθήσει στο μάρκετινγκ του παιχνιδιού. :p Να σημειώσω πως το παιχνίδι έρχεται σε μεταλλικό ανάγλυφο κουτί.

Χαλαρό παιχνιδάκι για όσους ψάχνουν κάτι εύκολο και γρήγορο.  Την κάνει την δουλειά του (ειδικά στα 5-6 άτομα) αλλά δεν ξεχωρίζει από τα υπόλοιπα του είδους.

If 6 Nimmt was a trick-taking game, it would be Little Devils.  They're clearly trying to present it in the same light, right down to the representation of penalty points as icons of little horned heads.

These similarities lead one to compare the two games directly, and 6 Nimmt is the better filler, but this is nice for variety.

This game comes in a tin... Of course I'd own it!

In all seriousness this is actually a very interesting twist on a normal Trick Takeing Game. This game only has one suit, but during a round your either playing higher then the first card played or lower then the first card played. Wether your going higher or lower is determined by the second player. 

Very interesting game. I'll have to keep it in the rotation for awhile.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A neat little trick taking game that feels like a cross between trick taking and other simple hand management games like 6 Nimmt.

The deck is simply a sequentially numbered deck, with all cards dealt to the players.  The leadoff player plays a card from his hand, and then the second player plays a card from his hand.  If the second card is higher than the leadoff card, everyone else must play higher than the leadoff card as well, and high card wins the trick.  If the second card is lower, everyone else must play lower than the leadoff card as well, and low card wins the trick.

No trumps or anything in this trick taker.  Simply play higher or lower, but not too high or too low, as it is a trick-avoiding game!

There are some small twists to the system, like what happens if you can't play higher when higher is required, or lower when lower is required, but that's essentially it.  Each card has a number of little devils on it, and you're trying to avoid taking them, as each little devil is a point, and points are bad.  Once someone hits 100 points, the game is over and the player with the lowest score wins.

The only drawback for me is that being able to card count is a huge advantage in this one, as remembering what has been played is a huge advantage.  You know exactly what's in the deck, so there's no random element of wondering if a certain card is in play or not.  I don't like having to keep track of this sort of thing, but fortunately no one in my game group really tracks cards hardcore either, so it's not a huge problem.

Overall, a good change of pace on the trick taking genre with a different feel from most trick takers.

The artwork isn't much but the game is a lot of fun and quite tricky. Probably rewards card counting which I suck at (and would never want to try to do anyway) but is a nice trick taker in any case.

Edit: that was in March. I've liked this more and more with each play. Lots of fun and great to screw people over audaciously. Still crummy art and cards but love the game.

Probably inspired by Take 6. The idea in both games is the same: avoid taking cards that display devils (bulls). The main decision comes when you're leading into the trick, in which case you play your card with the most devils because the first-played card cannot take the trick.
Not a lot to think about, but still plenty of fun.

Trick taking game where you don't want to be the one taking the tricks. Game has numbers similar to 6Nimmt with instead of cow heads you have devil heads with are points. First card played is the seed card, second card indicates if you should be going higher or lower than seed number if you can't play a card in the right direction you will win the trick unless another player has to play a worse card.

Game has its moments with groups that prefer super light games, a good trick taking game for beginners.  Has an interesting twist to the usual trick taking mechanism.  Just is a little too light for our group usually.  But winning can be very satisfying, highly recommended still.

RATING: 1
While there are some choices to be made in the game, like what card your going to pick to play. All of the people I've played it with had the same feeling: there is very little control with 4 players. And with 3 players there isn't even a game, the player playing the last card almost always looses.

I have played it with 3 players and 4 player. Maybe there will be a bit more excitement when you play with 6 players, but i doubt it.

Little Devils is a good game, and it's great for introducing people to trick taking games.  It's one of those games where they put player numbers on the box, but they don't mean what they say.  What I mean is, at 3 players, the game just doesn't work out how it does at 4, 5 and 6.  That being said, I really like the idea of trying to play a card that is closest to the opening card.  I also like that the next player after the opener chooses how the trick will go, either higher or lower.  Really neat game and only gets better with the more players you have.

[i]Little Devlis[/i] a bastard child.  It carries  its mother [i]Sticheln's[/i] vicious trick-taking. It also features pain avoidance from its father [i]6 Nimmt![/i]. I'm not sure it surpasses either of these games but it does offer an engaging game nonetheless.  

Recommended for anyone who enjoys hand-management games with a mean streak (I do).  Best avoided by those who do not.

A nice beer and pretzels trick-taking game. Not much more to it than that. Sure, there's a twist to it, but it's nothing groundbreaking. The trick-taking genre is awash in games "with a twist," and this one is nothing special. It's fun enough for a few hands, but there are many better trick-taking games out there. I think a good litmus test for whether or not a given trick-taking game stands apart from the crowd is "Would you rather play this, or just play Spades?" I wouldn't turn down a game of Little Devils, but honestly, I'd rather play Spades.

A lightweight spread-the-pain trick-taking game. There's clearly a little bit of strategy, so you should pay attention. But all the cleverness in the world won't make up for a bad hand or one that's a misfit to what other people lead.

You have to take cards out for different player counts, which is a bit of a minus for me.

trick taking game. The aim of the game is to get as few points as possible, you play until one player has 100 points. 

We played a 4 player game, it had cards from 1 through 36, with 0 through 5 points on them. The first player plays a card, the second player determines whether everyone has to play a higher or lower value than that first card (by playing a higher or lower card). Highest/lowest wins the trick (which is bad). If you can't play a higher card when that's asked, you can play lower and then lowest card wins the trick (or reversed if lower was asked). 

I enjoyed this, it felt a bit like take 5, as you're trying to avoid taking cards, and there's some take that as well.

Little Devils is a trick-taking game where you're trying to earn the least little devils before someone hits 100. Each trick starts with someone playing a card with a number (and some number of devils, but not five on the leading card). The second card in dictates if the trick is ascending or descending, and whoever is the highest or lowest (or most not matching the pattern) takes the trick and starts the next one.

So you're managing your hand, trying to win as few little devs as possible, and be the lowest score when someone who is terrible hits one hundred. It does similar things for me as Dwarf King.

Cute mechanic and I appreciate the novel approach to trick taking.  However, it didn't come together for me.  There is a lot of card counting, and if you don't card count then the game is just random.  There doesn't ever seem to be a middle ground where you make interesting choices.  I don't mind a little card counting in a trick taking game, but I like it if it's not the only thing going on.

Maybe if there were a global trend in where the devil icons were in the deck (instead of a striped repeating pattern that is hard to remember) plus some cards were removed from the deck, the game would start to be more interesting.

RATING: 5
27-09-2014. Rated after 1 play. Simple trick-taking game without suits, in which the first player plays a card and the second player determines 'suit', you either have to play higher or lower than the initial number. The highest or lowest card wins the trick and you try to avoid points. 
It's a bit more thinky than I would like in a trick taker, because you have to think/judge/gamble a little on what cards are still out there.

--Feb2013-- It's amusingly [thing=432]6 Nimmt![/thing]y, but probably not great.  Definitely better with 5 than 3; I'd not quite rate it as well in the lower end of the player count.

Fine light trick-taking game. Was basically replaced by Diamonds for me, but definitely fits the bill for a lighter card game that would work for non-gamers.

Little Devils --

I think this may be a good game, possibly even a very good game, but not with only three players.

This is a trick-taker, but the interesting bit is that instead of following the suit led, players follow the [u]relative rank[/u] (higher or lower) of the second card played.

The player who leads a card cannot win that trick.  The first card to follow determines whether higher or lower (than the card led) takes the trick.  However, if subsequent players are void in cards higher/lower than the card led, their card trumps those which do fit the higher/lower criterion.

With three players, this simply wasn't interesting enough, but with more, this could be quite engaging.

Another way of putting it:  The mechanics are what make this game interesting, and at three players the mechanics are weak.

Vigyázzhat kicsit másképpen. Itt sorban játszanak ki a játékosok egy lapot és a másodiknak letevő játékos határozza meg, hogy fölfele vagy lefele kell lapot rakni. Az adott irány legtávolabbi lapja visz ha csak ilyenek vannak, ha van viszont ellentétes irányú lap is, akkor az. A játékossorrend miatt ebben a játékban nagyobb a szerencse szerepe, mint az elődben, nekem kevésbé is jött be, de szórakoztató, jó kis partyjáték.

Not a bad little trick taking game, as it has a neat mechanic that you establish on the second card whether higher or lower cards can win and then you can flip that at a subsequent point. Unfortunately, it's still pretty luck-based and I don't think you have enough control of what to play to get the win.

Comparisons to 6 nimmt! are inevitable. Little Devils is fun, but not more fun than 6 nimmt! Card counting is too greatly encouraged.

An okay game to play, just has not a unique feel to it. 
It feels like hearts with different pictures and numbers instead of suits. 

Don't think it will get played very often. 
I mean when i go over to someones house to play games, 
I would not take this game with me. 

Unless.......there is a devil themed party.

Great short card game!  It reminds me a bit of 6 Nimmt! and related games.  Easy to learn, simple and quick to play.  This is an excellent filler game, and a great one to teach to non-gamers.

Simple "try not to take tricks" game with no suits (just numbers). Playing high or low can modify whether the trick is taken by high or low card. Ok filler.

Like most of their other tin box releases (I still don't like those, they don't stack well) this is a light card game filler. It's a trick taking game where you score points for the devils depicted on the cards in the trick. And you win when you're the player with the least points when someone goes over 100 points.
While there are some choices to be made, all of us had the same feeling: there is very little control with 4 players. With 3 I don't see this working at all.
I also think 100 is a bit too much, the game did outstay it's welcome a bit. 80 would be a better limit I think.
I had one hand where I had cards 33-36. That meant I had the 4 highest cards in the game, meaning I would have to take at least 4 tricks, unless I could lead with those cards. But you can only lead when you take a trick... and you don't want to take tricks. So you're quite dependent on what cards you are dealt.

A fairly unremarkable trick taking game where having a broad range of numbers is certainly preferable to having all high or all low cards. A diverting filler but nothing memorable.

I guess the closest comparison is 6 Nimmt!, but Little Devils has none of the charm or difficult decisions that 6 Nimmt! does. Probably intended to be a family game, Little Devils is dumbed down to the point where there there are few, if any, meaningful player decisions to be made. Disappointing given the nice art, great cardstock and art, and nifty tin box.

This seems like a solid little trick-taking game. Very simple overall, but the twist is that the second card played during a trick determines whether the highest card will win, or the lowest card. The game reminds me a little bit of my favorite trick-taking game, Sticheln, in that you're usually trying to not take any tricks while also sticking your opponents with as many points as possible.

[b]Player Count Verdict: 4+[/b]
After a recent 3-player game, we very quickly realized that the game is broken at that player count. The first player can never win a trick and the third player can decide who takes the trick each time, so the game is incredibly dull. The BGG poll is correct here, this game is better with more players.

Quick and simple one color trick taking game. Good for a filler, might work as well with casual players. Explained very fast, played almost as fast. Nothing very special, but give it a go, if it's available and you need a filler.

Don't remember it too well, despite having only played it 6 hours ago. I suppose it didn't make much of an impression. Was a decent game, I didn't *dislike* it but I wasn't thrilled either. Reminded me a lot of Hearts, which I am no good at. Also, was frustrating long in the same way that Hearts is. May have been better with more players.

A little too un-confrontational. Not as much of a screw-factor as regular Carc, which makes it less fun. The bonus tiles are a good element.

I wish my game partners (my 6 y.o. and husband) liked this more. I think the game is less intuitive than vanilla Carc., and it just hasn't appealed to them because of that, but I like the added complexity.

RATING: 4
The setup time is really the killer in our experience. For that, we'd rather play normal 2p Carcassonne. The best part of it is the limiting castle wall, but the running around the outside edge and having scoring effects was sort of lame. In some ways, this makes me want to do a constrained variant of normal Carcassonne...

Excellent, if slightly too luck-dependent, addition to the franchise, and a great 2-player game in it's own right. The randomness of the bonus tokens collected as the players move along the scoring track is perhaps overdone (nice mechanic though!).

I enjoy what Knizia's tinkerings with the Carcassonne mechanics have done to this game. I will always request this over the original if I have two players. One of my preferred two-player games. UPDATE: traded for Starship Catan, since I now have Carc: the City. UPDATE: Carc: the City is not that great. I think that I probably should have kept this one.

RATING: 9
A super game for two.  One of the best, in fact.  I really liked Hunters and Gatherers, but this is better.  It's the added twist of having a confined space, the bigger tiles, the way the scoring track goes around the board and the cleverly placed bonus tiles.  There's also slightly more to think about than in the other versions I've played - it's easier to block, the bonus chits mean that sometimes you want to score an exact amount, the size of the hole at the end can be crucial and you may wish to leave it large or close it dwon a little.  It an extrememly well designed game.  It may be "standing on the shoulders of a giant," but it does it well!  I also think it's a great "partner game" and also one you can play with kids from about age 8 or 9.  I think this is a game that will gets lots of plays over the years.

From the Reviews: This game does not seem to entertain as well as the original does, people will play it, but to often. I does seem to offer a little more interaction, due to the roads only having to match up, but the "puzzle" doesn't look so good afterwards.

RATING: 5
+ Building the city inside the castle is pleasant enough and offers quite a few interesting decisions.
- Since you are at the mercy of whatever tile you draw, it seems like there isn't a whole lot of advance planning going on.


Why it's previously-owned:
It was just too simple to be anything more than a time filler.  We have a wide range of games in the collection now so that even if we want just a quick, light game, it can be a bit more engaging than this one.  
I gave this game away to a friend (who has young children) for his birthday.

RATING: 4
I didn't think I could ever dislike a "Carcassone" until I played this one.  I  felt it removed every aspect that I enjoy from the original -- the non-matching images bothered me, we found it isolated the players in opposite corners rather than encouraged you to play aggressively to ruin the other person's plans, etc.  Most unpleasant.

Very nice addition to the Carcassonne family of games. The rules are mostly the same as the standard game so learning the rules is quick and staight-forward. The bonus tiles really add another level to the game and the half tile features make for some interesting decisions in placing tiles that wouldn't come up in the other versions of the game. A very enjoyable game.

One of the better two-player games. I find it more fun than the regular Carcassonne. I like the city limits making the game grow inwards rather than outwards, and I like that only the roads must match, while there are more different features on the tiles to tickle my tactical tendencies.

A classic. Knizia found a way to make the scoring a mini-game in itself (with the "wall tiles"), which is brilliant. However, it creates a "runaway leader" problem, as the player who quickly manages to grab a few wall tiles has a distinct advantage. Also, the luck of the draw can get frustrating with the Markets. Still, I like this fresh take on Carcassonne and the new tactics the wall tiles offer, and the art looks pretty good, too.

RATING: 7
Knizia's two-player version of Carcassonne does some interesting things with the basic template.  The wall that defines and limits the play area and forms a v.p. track, scattered with bonus chits is the cleverest.  There's also the free-er tile placement, with towers able to butt up against houses and so on, a year before Wrede adopted it for Carc: The City. This being Knizia, end game scoring is a little more involved too.

As for the game play, it's recognisably still Carcassonne.  Yet those walls both help in finishing off buildings and paths and keep the playing area tight and competitive.  Nicely done.

Production quality is good, for my money the artwork is the most attractive of this series.

After sitting on my shelf for a while, finally got to play this.  It's as good as many other suggested.  Very tactical and the luck in the game is much more manageable than the original Cascassone when playing two players.  You often find yourself in situations contemplating helping your opponent get a small amount of poinnts to prevent them from scoring a bonus tile or enlarging a feature.  It felt as if there were fewer opportunities to snipe into others features in this one. I'm undecided if this is good or bad.
All in all, my favorite Carcassonne.

Much the same as Carcassonne but slightly more constrained, thanks to the walls, not that this is a bad thing, it just forces you to adapt slightly different strategies.  

What I do like the most is the Fountains on roads, they make the roads far more valuable.  

I do like the scoring system better and the bonus chips on the walls, allow you to vary play each time to suit those bonuses.

Knizia's contribution to the Carcassonne franchise is, not surprisingly, an interesting and very worthy variant of the original.  This one feels more complex in its decision making.  

Because you need only match roads, and not terrains, each tiles has many more options for placement, and for many advanced gamers, this is going to provide a richer gaming experience.  

On the other hand, for non-gamers, I don't think this the version you should start with; better to go with the original version with nice, simple and yes, elegant decisions.

{1 play} We liked it once we wrapped our heads around the idea that only paths have to match.  I think the "exact score" tokens are a neat idea, but they might be too dominant.  We both managed to get our fair share, but I wondered afterwards if you could win by ignoring them and just trying to score big points.  Also, in a close game, they add a luck element that you may not like.  In our game, for example, I managed to pick up two "score an extra 5 points at game end" tokens, which kind of threw me the game.  Still, a nice two-player variant to Carc that may only get better with more plays under our belts.  We'll see.

[ESP] Probablemente una de las mejores versiones del juego.

Carcassonne: the Castle es una adaptacion del clasico Carcassone para 2 jugadores, completamente independiente.
Dentro de un muro, que actua como scoring track, los jugadores deben colocar los tiles para ubicar a sus caballeros en las torres, heraldos en los caminos, siervos en los palacios y mercaderes en los mercados.  Una de las novedades es que a lo largo del scoring track existen fichas de bonus que tendran un impacto fundamental en la puntuacion.

i like the scoring track and enclosure, i like the feeling that you're actually building something, the heavy need for blocking/joining, etc.  the turn off for me after the first play was the visualization of the tiles in general.  butting a wall of brick up against a field just didn't look right.  but when i'm on a house in the castle, it feels like it's actually my house.  when i'm on a forest in carc h&g, playing on it just feels like i'm making the neutral forest bigger.  so far i like this game more with every play.  if you are annoyed with the slight lack of visual intuition, give it more of a chance!

Good game, but I don't recommend it for Carcasonne owners.  I'd be happy enough owning Castles alone, but it is very rare that I feel the urge to play this game over regular Carcasonne.

Compared to regular Carcasonne, there is more options and, arguably, more strategy involved, but for me it is less enjoyable.  I just find the sprawling, more open feeling of regular Carcasonne more appealing.

Great 2er version of Carcassonne. The wall tiles add a nice dynamic to the scoring, forcing players to think about the timing of their own scoring as well of that of their opponents.

I picked this up after playing, and liking, Carcassonne: H&G.  I thought a two player variant sounded fun and different enough it would be worth trying out.  It was fun to play for awhile, but the game seems to ends too abruptly, and we preferred the open game play of the other variants to the closed, claustrophobic feeling of this one.

The artwork of the tiles can still be improved, otherwise this game is a refreshing change from the rest of the Carcassonne family since instead of expanding outward we are building within a castle.

This is a good time.  After playing a few games, my girlfriend and I decided to use a similar constraint on the wall tiles that exists for the "tactics" cards in "Battle Line."  (You can only have one more than your opponent does.)  This seems to work pretty well in keeping the tiles balanced, since one player can be completely routed if he/she is unlucky enough to miss all the tiles on the scoring track, while the other player gets them all, resulting in a lop-sided unfun game for all.

One of our first 2 player games. We played this a ton. We would probably play it more, but I think we loaned it to someone and it never came back.

Edit: Ended up rebuying this and bumped the rating up to an 8.5. We prefer this game over The City because it plays much faster and has simpler rules. Right now, this is our favorite Carc game.

I really like this two-player version of Carcassonne.  Some of the more restrictive tile laying rules are gone, replaced by a constrained playing area and an interesting use of the scoring track.  However, I'm much more fond of the City, even though there are mechanics in the Castle that aren't present in the City.  I like the art in the City much better, too.

Good two-player version of Carcassonne.  It is not as good as the original because there is a tendency for the leader to run away with points (and the game).  There needs to be some mechanism to slow down the acceleration of the leading player otherwise it can become a rout.  If players are mindful of this possibility and keep the game tight, it is a pretty good game.  UPDATE:  Improved score.  We had been playing this in a way that scores too many wall tiles because of rule ambiguity (see the discussion points on BGG).  Better game than I originally thought.

Bought this to play with Mrs. M and like it enough to play instead of Hunters & Gatherers (our preferred version of Carcassonne)from time to time. The match-only-roads rule takes some getting used to but I like the bonus tiles but am not sure they don't create a rich-get-richer problem.

This is a wise choice for someone who wants to experience the Carcassonne play-style but knows they won't buy any expansions and will only play in a pair. However, in the shadow of the main Carcassonne game, the format here adds little, and the design of the pieces is not so good as the main game series (we often find ourselves double-checking if we've finished building a feature).

Favorite of the line of Carcassonne sequels.
What I like most about this one is that there
is an increased level of strategy due to the

strategically about how and when to score.

RATING: 7
While I definitely liked it, it took a while to wrap my head around how different the game looks due to the slightly differnet ways the tiles connect.  Yes, roads still have to connect to roads, but the way that towers and houses connect fast and loose vs. cities in the original took some getting used to.  I really love the bonus tiles on the scoring track, and felt like they were definitly worth trying to stop for. I think it'll defintiely get a fair bit of play.

I like the constricted nature that the border provides, but the fiddly nature of the rules regarding the bonus tiles, and the seemingly weak house (vs. castle) pieces makes this drop a notch for me. 

Edit: Not sure what I was thinking. After rereading all the rules, the bonus tiles are perfectly clear if the rules are read properly. Also, after several plays lately, I'm loving this one. Great for playing on a small table while visiting someone in the hospital! :)

Better than H&G for two.  The finite area and the bonus tiles make it to be a more cutthroat game as well as allowing for some planning to snag the all important corner tiles.  My favorite Carc, and heck, an excellent two player game.

Tetszett a játék, Carcassonne, de mégis más. A behatárolt terület, a lapok lerakásának a szabályai, a bónusz pontok és a legnagyobb kastély tulajdonságok kifejezetten megszínesítik a játékot. Ráadásul a grafikailag elviselhető, mert azért nem egy csodaszép, de nagyon hangulatos a témához. Szívesen játszanék még vele, mert aránylag gyors játék. Talán egy kicsit a lapkalerakási lehetőségek korlátozottak a terület behatároltsága miatt, de bőven van benne ezen felül taktikai lehetőség.

RATING: 9
The Castle is Reiner Knizia's twist on Carcassonne. It's exclusively a two player game, and it's a little harder to get the hang of than the rest of the series. Worth getting if you like any of the other games in the series, but it shouldn't be your first Carc purchase.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Good variant, but we prefer the base game Carc (w/ I&C & T&B). My own Carc pref is now online, too, so Castle & City, while fun games, just aren't getting any table time...  :(   Needs new home!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I find the Carcassonne system rather bland and unengaging with little interaction between players.  Knizia, as is expected, makes some marked improvements.  First he limits it to two-players, the best number for Carcassonne to enhance control, reduce downtime and encourage interaction.  Now depriving your opponent of points is just as good as scoring your own.  The less restricted tile-laying adds some depth absent in other versions of Carcassonne.  Finally, the bonus tiles along the score track really propel this game above its peers.  Trying to score exact points to secure a tile completely changes the dynamics of a normal Carcassonne game.  Still, it does not completely shed the problems with its predecessors.  Anyone that enjoys Carcassonne should pick this up.

G/f has a good grasp of the strategies in this one and our games can be very tense. Some of the bonus tiles (2x castle??) are rather unbalanced and dictate the outcome far more than they should.

Best carcassone version - possibly it's just a better game 2 player, but I think the boundry helps, and I like the bonuses on the wall/scoring track to collect.

* Update Was my favourite Carcassone version but it's only 2 player and with the release of Carcassonne die Stadt it just isn't getting played anymore. When I'm in a position to play Carcassone:The Castle, Carcassonne die Stadt gets played instead. Maybe I'll get burned out on the new one and come back to this. 

** Update, nope, played the Castle again and we're both in agreement we prefer die Stadt, Castle traded 

*** Update, and now ended up with it again following a maths trade. Need to play it again to see if it's worth keeping.

**** Update, played with my son, and he likes it - so for now it's off the trade pile.

4 Basic ways to score...Several ways to multiply those points---- if you plan how you gain your points moving forward on the VP track.

Cleverly different than other Carcasonnes as there is a wall.  It is around an unbuilt area and your job in this version is to build roads, courtyards, manors, or castles.

I love the simplicity of these games and yet that you have to plan ahead, and balance where to place the little workers.

RATING: 7
More ways to score than the original, but feels less tight - many more ways to place tiles and get points for them.  Fewer placements with an optimal solution.  Overall, you wind up with more options, and less strategy - which sounds strange, but seemed true.  IMO, the original plays very, very well (and better than this)with 2, so this is not needed.

Update: Traded away.  My wife is my main partner for 2 player games, and she vastly prefers standard Carc, as do I.

This is a very good, quick-playing 2p game. There are some differences between this and the other Carcassonnes that I have played: the shape of the field remains constrained, the only tile sides that have to match are the paths, and one rarely gets points for unfinished buildings and/or paths at game end. All of this leads to a lot more flexibility and opportunities in tile placement. The scoretrack runs along the castle walls, which is also a cute touch. Finally, the wall tiles make for some interesting twists and force some sub-optimal plays just to be able to grab a wall tile.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Blows regular Carcassonne out of the water.  The castle walls force conflict inward, and the relaxed adjacency rules allow more tactical play where you dictate where to lay the tile, rather than the tile dictating to you where it may be played. The need to obtain wall tiles causes more granular scoring, keeping the game at a fast tempo. Absolutely perfect implementation of this system. The only Carcassonne game you really need. I have the original to play with my young kids, but this one is where it's at.


Wonderful 2-player title and one we return to often.

2P Quick, easy-to-learn yet impossible-to-master game; always ready to play. Our house rule: only pickup a wall tile AFTER all your turn's scoring. (not during intermediate scoring) Also, we found that the Market Tile is too powerful (it makes all markets in one court worth 7 pts. instead of 3 each); but don't have a solution.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A great variant of Carcassonne for two-players only, but that is my favorite number of players for Carcassonne anyway. I especially like that unfinished buildings and roads are worth nothing in the end. The bonus tiles on the scoring track give you an incentive to score early and aim for specific numbers. And the bonus tiles itself give you new hidden options or goals. 

We always played with a house-rule: roads may not end in the castle walls. I have been introduced to the game with this rule and only later found out that it was a house-rule. The idea of the it is to make it harder to finish the roads, and it worked quite well that way.

There are a couple of differences between Carcassonne: The Castle and regular Carcassonne.  First, not all the features of a new tile have to match the existing tiles in play in order to place it.  The only feature that has to match are the paths.  The act of placing tiles of different features next to each other creates the edges of the features.  It is actually pretty clever.

Second, the play area is defined by a frame, the castle "wall", which also doubles as a score track.  So no need to worry that your castle will grow off of the edge of your table.

There are also bonuses to collect, by landing on them on the score track, and by building the largest "keep".

I think The Castle is a nice variant of Carcassonne that is essentially Carcassonne, but is different enough from regular Carcassonne to not feel like the exact same game.  But it really isn't as good as regular Carcassonne, and I would only suggest it as a novelty for fans of Carcassonne.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Aside from the tile laying, this game feels a lot different than Carcassonne. The wall (castle?) around the city makes the game strategic, as it forces you to carefully consider tile placement right from the start.

I really enjoy Carcassonne: The Castle, but if you're just looking for a good 2 player game, I'd recommend starting with original, as it plays great with 2.

Part of the enjoyment I get out of Carcassonne is the pleasant, homey artwork. Unfortunately, other versions of Carc do not have this elusive quality. This is one of those.

I gotta say, I think this is by far the most engaging Carcassoonne variant. The greater flexibility in where tiles can be played (due to the weaker restrictions on edge matching), the bounded playing surface, and the optimization for two players all greatly enhance the playing experience for me. I dislike the original Carcassonne, I like Hunters and Gatherers but only with smaller numbers of players, but I like Carcassonne: The Castle a lot.

A great 2-player version of Carcassone (and really no reason you couldn't add some meeples and play it with 3 or even 4). Building from the outside in and the more lax restrictions on placement (essentially you only need to pay attention to roads) give you tons of options for each tile.

A bit long for its fun value (a hazard, I find, with all the Carcassonne games). That said, it's a neat variant on the Carc family, by Spielmeister Knizia. Turns Carc inside-out by having all the building take place within the frame of the "city walls." Nice bonus mechanism around the scoring track makes it important sometimes to score lower than your maximum-scoring move for a given turn, so you can grab a bonus on a certain number.

This is likely "only" getting a 7 because I've only played it once. There's nothing here that really makes me like it less than other Carc games (apart from the art), I'm just more familiar with those so right now I'm craving them more.

I do think this works better as a 2p game than base Carc or H&G. The way scoring and placement work make it feel much more competitive, which I think is needed for 2p. Carc usually feels a little weird to me at 2p because it lacks the semi-cooperative aspect which makes the social game so interesting and enduring, but here the focus is shifted dramatically toward the cutthroat aspect and it just works great.

Plus, I just love the little bonus wall tiles. It really forces some interesting choices, and the hidden information is a breath of fresh air.

Will definitely be playing this one again!

RATING: 8
I find this more fun than regular Carcassone. The addition of the wall tiles (a bit like power-ups from a computer game) adds just enough complexity to make the game more appealing to me in head to head play.

If you will predominantly be playing with two players then I would suggest that you buy this in preference to regular Carcassonne.

RATING: 7
Just more of the same except limited to two players.  The game is not as good looking as the original Carc since it has all the blocky squares on the tiles.  
Much rather play one of the other Carcassonnes.

RATING: 6
Two-player Carc with some scoring variation.  A useful variant on Carc.  Does not capture the elegance with aggressive play as the original Carc.

Without any doubt my favourite Carc.
I got bored with the original one quite fast, but still consider it as one of the classics that drew me (and a lot of other people) into the new way of boardgaming.

RATING: 7
This is the most strategic and heavy game of the Carcassonne series.  Kind of like saying that the New Orleans Saints are the best terrible team in the NFL.  I don't play Carcassonne because I want depth.  I just want a beer and pretzels type game I can play with my wife.  We don't look to play this one anymore and keep going back to the often expanded base game.  This was a stepping stone game and an excellent one at that, but I have just moved on, and my wife has just stepped back.  And that's ok with me.

RATING: 5
I don't get why some think it's a better Carc game for 2 than the original Carc. I don't like the fewer tile placement rules in this version and I don't like that you can only build inside the Castle compared to the unlimited tile placement in Carcassonne. Also, the random bonus chips are just too different (some are very strong, some are weak) and can sometimes decide the winner which is a minus in my book.

My recommended number of players: 2

Dear Dr. Knizia,

I still think you are a genius, but your version of Carcassone doesn't do it for me. 

If I'm not matching tiles, what the hell am I doing? It won't look really pretty at the end. I PLAY TO MAKE PRETTY COUNTRYSIDE! And I totally understand farmers and I miss them! But if I want to do tiles and think hard---I can do that with your foray into Mesopotamia. 

I bet I could learn to like this game. Really, I could. But I don't really ever want to play it again. 

I still worship you.

Chris

A really great version of Carcassonne.  The changes--among then the inability to score for incomplete buildings, the squeeze put on the board by the new border and the new placement rules that only roads must be placed so that they continue off of each other--really change the game and offer a brand new Carcassonne experience.

RATING: 7
Best of the Carc series that I've played, more flexibility than the original in tile placements, and the bonus tiles lend a nice "gotta get JUST the right score" element that keep things interesing. Played primarily with my wife and she loves it.

This was the first Carcassonne we learned.  Our first few attempts were dismal failures, as we struggled to understand the rules for placing tiles.  After a couple of long cooling-off periods, we returned to this game once more and finally figured it out.  Although the game is still challenging, we now really enjoy it.  It would probably be alot easier to pick this up if you're already familiar with other Carcassonne games, or if someone else teaches you.  (We played the original version once after becoming comfortable with this one, and were much faster to understand it.)

I'm one of the people who has to complain about Carcassonne: The Original just about every chance I get. I don't know what posessed me to get this one, but I'm glad I did.

Probably the best version of Carcassonne in existence. Works superbly for 2 players, and departs sufficiently far from normal Carc to command a place in everyone's collection. Knizia took Carc and weaved in several solid ideas, the lack of incomplete regions scoring, different adjacency rules, the catchup tiles, even made good use of the empty space in the castle. A wonderful version of Carc from a wonderful designer brain. I am truly surprised this has not been reprinted for a long time now. Highly recommended.

Easily my favorite of the Carcassonne games I've played. Knizia takes all of the familiar elements of Carcassonne and adds in several competing ways to score which add amazing tension and depth to the decision-making.

The corner bonus tiles are genius. I love the way they influence your play for the rest of the game. I also like that many things will go unscored, but not necessarily everything...if you have the right bonus tile. Even the manipulation of how large the 'empty' space is for the Keep Bonus is a fun element.

I've kind of soured on Carcassonne's multiplayer iterations, but I think Carc:the Castle will deserve some play in our rotation of two player games. I'd be happy to play it most of the time someone suggests it.

This game is so fun; I don't even care if I win or lose. While lighter than most games that rank a high score, I think that this games fills a niche in our gaming collection that no other game could fill. I constantly think of this game when my boyfriend asks me what we should play.

RATING: 9
This is my favorite Carcassonne game. Although it is just two-player and more abstract than the original, I think the bonus tiles on the scoring track add a whole new dimension to the strategy of the game. I also like the freedom of tile placement, allowing for more creativity, and the addition of the castle walls for a confined space and different starting points. Overall, it's a Carcassonne that's very fun to play, and one that I feel there is very little to improve upon.

I love Carcassonne and all its permutations but this is too much of a "been there, done that" feeling.  The frame is nice and the bonus tokens are cool, but it just isn't that much of a variation on what we've already done before.  Much more Wrede than Knizia, regardless of the billing.

This is a excellent version of Carcassonne for two people. Although I don't see why you could'nt use the meeples from the original game to turn it into a fine 3 player or perhaps 4 player game. The board would be too small for more than that. Its as good as the original

Excellent Carcassonne variation.  I primarily play 2 player Carc. with my 8 y.o. and the tile placement rules in this game are pretty easy to follow for kids.

As far as playing with kids, this one and Carc. the Discovery are my favorites.  Kids of Carc is great with younger ones.

RATING: 7
For some reason or another I've always liked this version of Carcassonne better than the other titles in the series. I think this is because of the topographical restrictions, it is not possible to create 'islands of blissful quiet' where the other player is not to be seen. No, we're talking some interaction with bite here. In addition, there is the nagging question in one's head of skipping over a bonus tile or not. Granted, they may not be helpful, but at the same time leaving them for your opponent to pick up is not a very good idea either.  This increases the tension in the game too.

Reiner Knizia did an excellent job of creating a version of Carcassonne which plays wonderfully with just 2 players, much more so than its 'unrestricted' brethren which always feel rather tame. De Burcht results in quite a fight as far as the series goes, and is therefore hands-down my favourite of the lot.

Components: I like the artwork as much as that of H&G, but not as much as that of the original; it reminds me a bit of a Where's Waldo? illustration. Overall great quality production.

Experience: Not having to match anything up except roads takes out some of the fun for me, but the added facet of trying to score specific amounts of points in order to acquire the wall tiles adds an interesting flavor to the game. This game benefits from the simplified pasture-scoring of H&G. I think the game works very well for two.

I prefer this to the original Carcassonne, though it only plays two players, of course. I think Reiner did a brilliant job matching the spirit and primary ruleset of Carcassonne while at the same time adding a few fresh elements -- most particularly of course the tactical play toward the castle mini-tiles. Also, a very bright and attractive presentation -- something about the coloring of the box and the tiles just lights up our game sessions.

I like the liberalized placement rules. Those eliminate any reason to whine about the draws, so stop it! They also give you a better defense against the player who goes for the sprawling courts (farms). I'm not sure what I think of the wall tiles. I should play a game or two without those to form a better opinion.

See general comments for Carcassonne. A different slant (same mechanic) as standard Carcasonne. Don't get caught thinking that uncompleted facilities get scored as in the standard game: they do not. A enjoyable two-player game, with the corner tiles adding some flavor.

RATING: 7
Two player Carcassonne stand alone game.  Players are now restricted to playing tiles into city walls.  Pawns can be played on towers, houses, roads or courts (=courtyards).  The tile adjacency rules have been loosened slightly so now only roads have to be continued from tile to tile, but it's still tricky.  Bonus chits for hitting certain spaces on the victory point track add a nice element of decision making when deciding when/how to score.  Different enough to warrant owning.

Among the best two-player games created, right up there with Hellas, Kupferkessel & Co, and Lost Cities. Knizia features many engaging choices and lots of give-and-take decisions. Committing men can get you long-term points... but overcommitting can leave you unable to score at all! The sprinking of starting places means the board usually develops from various places.

I own both Hunters & Gatherers and the Castle, and the two are definitely non-redudant.  The Castle has fewer restrictions on tile placement, but the roads can still create tricky problems and are often as useful for blocking as they are for scoring.  My wife loves to go after the bonus tiles on the wall, while I tend to try to maximize scoring and only pick them up if convenient.  I need to make sure I stay way ahead, however, as in a close game, the bonus tiles will make the difference.

Call me a Knizia fanboy, but lawd does he know how to take a simple game and make it so very engaging. The added boundary and it's respective rules helps contain the face-off and keep decisions tight.

Okay, so I love most anything Carcassonne (except for H&G, which I rather dislike), so it should come as no suprise that I like this one. It plays quickly among two Carc lovers & gives you a completely different feel while still being Carcassonne.

Knizia ruined a perfectly good game system. Carcasonne had already a large luck factor. Well this version is entirely based on luck. You can hardly protect your own positions (all cards can be placed every where. And the bonus tiles determine the winner in the end. (getting them has the same tactics as winning the jackpot)
The artwork is very poor compared with the other games.

Bought Eclectic Games, Reading Feb 2008

We only have the basic Carcassone, so have not much exposure to all the variants/expansions - but can state without hesitation that I enjoy the Castle more than the original game. A lot of typical Reiner Knizia interaction with your opponent, and lots more decisions to make regarding placing to make points or placing to stop your opponent, and making longer term moves for the end game. I know all this is in the original game, but here it is clear, and stronger. I love it.

Not as interesting as the original Carcassonne; offers fewer strategy choices and seems more luck driven.  Also lacks the colorful Meeples of the original, offering instead oddly proportioned Meeples of boring brown and tan; further, the tiles are not as aesthetically pleasing as those of the original.  That it is limited to two players is also a drawback relative to the original.  IMHO, you need only one Carcassonne game, and that one should allow more than two players.

RATING: 6
Fantastic 2-player version of Carcassonne. I find the interaction is less direct than with the original or H&G. The wall tiles make the game a bit more random. The fact that you only need to match up road edges (as in The City) gives more choices for tile placement.

RATING: 8
Making it two players reduces the downtime dramatically and gives the game a better pace - always a problem in Carcassonne. The scoring tiles add an interesting twist to the game - players have to try and balance between scoring quickly to get the tiles, and building up their big holdings. Typical Knizia that no one strategy is apparent and that several plays are required to explore all the possibilities the game contains. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
[5 plays] A fun variant of Carcassonne for only two.  The bonus tiles and constrained area give it some new twists.  Because incomplete stuff doesn't score, it's tough to balance whether to try to enlarge things or just focus on closing them off lest you lose everything.  Then again, you could get the bonus tile that lets you score something unfinished--but don't count on it, because you may not get it.  Tough choices.

Connecting non-path features is very different from other Carc games. A house can easily be connected with a tower or court (grass) piece. The only restriction is that streets always have to connect to streets or go into the outer wall. Getting an eye for these connection changes is tough.

Definitely a better version than regular Carcassonne in my opinion. The excitement of the tile race and the puzzle within a box (the castle walls) is what makes this one shine. However, even though it's fun I'm not sure that we really need it and I couldn't pass up the opportunity to get a game I've wanted for a couple of years. Might re-acquire in future.

[b]Rating based on - 15+ plays, 2 player[/b]
Carcassonne Contained. Reiner Knizia's spin on Carcassonne but built for only 2p. Has some different elements to regular Carcassonne such as building within a grid instead of organically, a scoretrack which has stops where you can earn bonus tiles that mix up the scoring conditions and add replayability eg. taking 2 turns in a row, scoring for uncompleted features (which do not score in this game unlike regular Carcassonne), double points for scoring a particular feature etc. It's fun, fast, and I felt it was much more interesting than regular Carc. I love the quirky art and the mystery of the hidden tiles plus the puzzle of trying to get to them to improve your scores. There is a built in tension of wanting to score big so therefore building and expanding as big as you can, versus the race for the tiles and the subsequent benefits your opponent may get by building small and scoring frequently. The merchants, which work pretty much like farmers, are much easier to score for here so if you don't like the farmers this might be something you are interested in. If you like games like Karuba and The Castles of Burgundy, then I heartily recommend this one.

A fast playing fun game in the Carcassonne family. Does not feel like the base game at all which is great as we are not big fans of the original. It took us a few games to warm up to it, but the combination of the funky art, the unique element of playing within a grid and the puzzle of getting to the bonus tiles as well as trying to build up the city inside the castle walls has a certain charm and just works harmoniously. Has a bit of a runaway leader problem so scores usually vary quite widely and I can't rate it higher because of that.

My gaming partner didn't agree with my decision to get rid of it. Re-acquired on 29/4/17.

If we're only playing with 2 this is the go-to version of Carcassonne. Like the frame approach and the addition of the bonus tiles. Adds new strategic elements not present in the original Carcassonne.

RATING: 6
In general, this is a more focused and tighter game than playing the original with two players.  Like the original however, the random flow of the tiles will usually determine how well you do, and sometimes you have very little strategic options for the tiles you get, especially towards the end of the game.

Likewise with the bonus tiles.  Although they are quite innovative and add a new strategic element to the game, acquiring them is a rather haphazard endeavor and they can sometimes create a real runaway leader problem.

(2-player) I *love* the graphics and look of the game. The game is essentially a race to obtain the bonus wall tiles since they can greatly affect your final score.  As such, most of gameplay is about completing features to get tiles and closing off your opponent's features to prevent them from getting wall tiles.  If one player falls behind in the wall tile race then the game is pretty much lost.

* Played 10+ times. Out of all the versions of Carcassonne, this one stands out quite a bit as being the most original, having a different feel, and tactics. Players can now target certain point scores for bonuses, then plan moves around their bonus tiles. Even if you are tired of Carcassonne, I do recommend trying this one out. It id different enough to warrant trying, and for me, it is worth owning. (I think both this and Hunters & Gatherers are the ones worth owning.) [F-r]

It took us a while to get fully accustomed to the different ways tiles can be placed.  Once you've got that down, you have all sorts of options with each draw.  I'd suggest this to fans of other Carc games looking for something shorter or just a bit different.

Targeted to be played soon as part of our ongoing "Oldies But Goodies" project. Last played: 7-22-07

RATING: 7.5
It takes a while to get used to the fact that the tiles do not have to match up. It doesn't look as nice as regular Carcassonne and is hard to get.

But despite all that it is the greatest way to play Carcassonne with 2 players. Very tactical with a few very cool twists.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Knizia took a good game (Carcassonne) and made it even better. While definitely still a part of the Carcassonne family, the luck of the draw factor has been reduced by allowing tiles to be placed more freely. The restrictions of the walls make for a tighter game and the special wall tiles add another layer of strategy. Great 2 player game.

RATING: 7
Decent enough, but I still find Carcasonne's base mechanic of territory grabbing a bit, well... boring. It's a game without tension.

Still on the fence - it's just ok - the tiles not lining up really bothers me about this version...

RATING: 6
Definitely my least favorite of the Carcassonnes.  It feels rather inelegant.  The collection of special abilities is a nifty twist, but the ability to ostensibly put ANY tile next to ANY other (except in the case of roads) makes it look less like a map at the end, and more like a quilt.  (I know "The City" lets you do it, too, but for some reason, it WORKS in that game.  Maybe because the wall changes each game.)  It's still fun, don't get me wrong, and good for 2 players.

Another take on the Carcassonne-theme. The walls with the bonus tiles add an interesting element, but tile placement feels a bit more obscure / not as natural as in the original Carc because it's not a matter of simply matching all adjacent cards.

A very good variation on Carcassonne. Lot more choices than the original game, you can almost always decide between offensive and defensive. Many parameters. Only drawback is that it is a 2 player game.

Similar to original Carcassonne but, in fact, not an expansion. I like it because it's a two players game and, by now, that's the only kind of games I can play (little children at home :-P).

Variation of Carcassonne designed for fewer players. 2 players.

RATING: 8
Carcassonne with a few Knizia twists thrown in: 2-players only, a neat scoring track that forms the outer wall of the castle (thus forcing the players to build inwards) and holds bonus tiles for the players to collect, and the tiles are designed in such a way that only the paths have to connect.  Works well.

A great 2-player only Carcassonne. A bit weirder now that tiles are a lot less discriminating about where they can be placed.

This is Knizia's 2-player take on Carcassone.  I still have not played the original Carcassone, but this one is a very good game.  The puzzle-like tiles are nicely done, and it's fun to see the castle you've created at the end of the game.  This game is also short, and pretty simple.  Honestly, we probably don't play it enough around my house.

Carc is only fun with 2 players and The Castle is specifically designed for 2 players.

An even better version of Carcassonne for two players.  Plays quickly and is more fluid since all you have to match up is roads.  A different strategy you don't try to make things as big as possible since things wouldn't finish you have to actively stop your own stuff to get it scored.  The largest house and unused space bonus is new and the bonus tiles when hitting specific score totals.

At the first glance: more complicated then the regular Carcassonne and extremely counterintuitive (in comparison to the original game). It's just mad how different the tile-placing rules are.

2 player only Carcassonne. I really enjoy the bonus tiles you can earn by landing on specific point values around the border! That adds a further element of strategy to something like basic Carc. If I only had 2 players, I'd prefer this over standard Carcassonne. Not bad Knizia...not bad.

Birthday Present purchased for Katie.  After playing a lot of standard carcassone, this was very different.  You have a confined space, you do not match the edges of the tiles (just the roads) and it is better to score lots of small points during the game rather than creating a big city (house/keep).
I like it more than Katie, but that may be because I keep winning!

An interesting twist on the usual Carcasonne.  This one is done by Kniza and it shows.  The two most unique things in this are the tower tiles, which are randomized at the begining of the game and placed in set spots on the scoring track, and the fact that the player with the largest house gets points for the biggest contiguous 'hole' at the end of the game.  Things like only getting tower tiles by being the first player to score and land directly on them really reminds me of Kniza's style.  An excellent, quick, easy to learn yet still stragetically deep game.

Carcassonne is already very good with two players, and so this is more than just the "two-player version" of Carcassonne.  It's a different game with different tactics and an altogether different feel.  The biggest change to the system is that the tile elements no longer have to match up at the edges, with the exception of the footpaths. On one hand, this gives you more choices for playing your tiles, which is good. On the other hand, it makes it difficult to block or defend against what your opponent is trying to do, which I think is bad. There's little danger of your meeples becoming stranded, which takes some of the drama out of the game. Knizia has made the game more incremental, more balanced, more contained, with fewer wild swings. You'll make a lot of small plays, picking up a few points here and there, trying to land on the tower spaces by exact count. Rarely will you have the chance to make a bold game-winning move. There's probably less luck in Knizia's version, but I sometimes miss the more wide-open, aggressive, cutthroat play of the original. I like the fact that both games exist.

Very highly recommended!

If you want to play a Carcassone game 2-players, this is without doubt the one to pick. The feature that makes this game stand out from the others is the "victory points wall" that surrounds the play area. This wall makes it a bit more challenging to place tiles as you get less and less room to place them as the game progresses. On top of this wall there are also tiles spread out, these  grant you different bonuses if you end your turn with you marker on them. This makes it a bit more interesting scoring points, as its not always best to try to get the most points during a turn if that makes you miss a tile.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Perfect 2 player game for me and my partner. Still feels like Carcassonne, but with more of a strategic twist. Short game length is a real bonus too. My favourite Carcassonne so far.

I like many of the ideas in this version, but it really doesn't grab me as much as other Knizia titles.

Other versions of Carcassonne had proved pretty popular, so we bought this to try 2-player.

It's Carc, but it's a bit different too. The wall is an interesting touch, as are the bonus tiles, and the way towers and houses work is a bit different from the usual Carc. scoring elements. It also has the benefit of playing in about 20-30 minutes, so we can fit in a few games in a session (3 is our limit so far!)

While not being my favourite flavour of Carcassonne as yet, it is an interesting game and I can see us playing it a fair bit.

Very interesting and tactical game.  Better IMHO than the original Carc.  The bonus chits enable you 2 ways to play aim for them or go for higher scoring combinations.  So far my gaming buddy and I have played 5 games and the person who gets out to a lead (and grabs a lot of the bonus tiles) has won every game!  The ability to place tiles on different parts of the board (from the start) gives a bit more scope when you draw a "bad" tile.  And the fact that you can pretty much place tiles anywhere (except for roads) means that each tile is a lot more versatile than in original Carc.

Not quite as good as standard Carcassonne; the aesthics are not quite as pleasing.  But the gameplay is fun, and tight.  Funnily enough, there seems to be less interraction than with standard Carcassonne.

I was expecting great things from this Reiner Knizia version of Carcassonne, but it left me feeling underwhelmed.  The original Carcassone with the a couple of the early expansions (Inns & Cathedrals, Traders & Builders) is still the best in my opinion.

Better than two-person Carcassonne. The wall tiles increase your tactical choices, making all the one- or two-point plays more significant. Every building is in play in profound ways, especially houses. Unfinished structures don't count at game end, so scoring is much simpler.

[Initial Impression: 8]
An excellent two-player design with multiple scoring avenues, and decisions involving trading off immediate small scoring opportunities for larger and longer-term (but possibly worthless) future opportunities.  Much of the game is spent taking small scoring sets in completed features (houses, castles, or roads) in order to exactly land on a corner wall space and claim the bonus tiles.  Depending upon the bonus tiles held, come-from-behind victories are quite possible, so both players feel involved throughout.  The game is perhaps best when played aggressively, which means spending more time blocking and attempting to take over your opponent's claimed features than time spent extending your own claimed territory.

I knew there'd be a Carcassonne for me. And from who else than the man himself. While the original Carcassonne isn't bad, there wasn't enough depth there to keep my interest. Expansions made the game clunkier instead of more interesting. Hunters & Gatherers tried to add wrinkles to the game to make it more interesting but instead it felt too much like the original but more random. Carcassonne: The Castle does away with some things we've taken as law in the series (like that you must match areas) but it adds simpler and tighter scoring. Knizia always has the best scoring mechanisms, and this is no different. The bonus tiles on the score track for landing exactly on them is also pure genius. Really takes a game that is mostly "just for fun" and makes it much more calculated and deliberate

Best with 2

One of the games I purchased to get my girlfriend into gaming. I was on a quest for the perfect two player game and this was one of the top contenders, ultimately everybody who's played it including my girlfriend enjoys the original Carcassonne much more so this variant never gets played. Games I don't play don't deserve to be in my bookcase, so I traded it.

The new features seem to make many believe there are more tactics and less luck in this version than others.  I disagree.  You still need the right tiles to accomplish what you wish and the roads can often make it even more difficult for you to get the "right" tile.  In addition, the wall tiles contribute a significant amount of luck. That said, I like it.  It's a good addition to the Carcassonne line, though I still prefer H&G and feel it remains the best 2-player version of the series.

If I still had this, it would be one of the first games I would suggest to play with just one other person. I feel that they did exactly what they set out to do: a Carcassonne game that works great for two players. It feels a little superfluous with the Big Box. :)

The first time I played this I was confused by the rules however the 2nd time was much better.  This is a quick two player game and is pretty simple once you've played it once.  It might take a couple of plays to figure out the mechanics as it is slightly different than the regular Carcassonne.  As I eluded to, the rules are a bit overwhelming.  The game offers several strategies and has it's fair share of luck in the tiles that you might draw at the corners and time of which you actually draw playing tiles.

Want to like this, but not happening yet. Need to play it more.

Update: After almost two years on the shelf we pulled this down and gave it another go. Glad we did! This time it clicked for us, and we ended up playing it a couple more times. 
We really like how quick it plays yet it still gives you the feeling of having played something more involving. We had been gravitating recently to card games in the evening due to their typically short play times, but we are happy to have re-discovered a "board" game that we can play in a similar amount of time.

This is more Anti-Carcassonne than Carcassonne.  It's easy to make large tile features and hard to close them...unlike Carc.  You want to score small, controlled amounts instead of large, monumental ones...unlike Carc.  The entire game is enclosed and builds inward instead outward in a freeform manner...unlike Carc.  Virtually all of the tiles don't match up or visually interact in any way...unlike Carc.  I guess it's nice to have a new take on the game, but in reality The Castle just makes me appreciate and want to play regular Carc more!  Having said all that, the game is still pretty decent.  Unfortunately, its association knocks it down a bit (sorta like the new Star Wars series compared to the old trilogy).

Update:  Run-a-fricking-way leader problems.  The variant which says you may only have one more "bonus scoring chip" than your oppoenent is HIGHLY reccommended.  Otherwise draw tiles until someone gets the first good set to rocket away...

Since I'm a sucker for any version of Carcassonne, I had to try this one out.  The fact that it was designed by Dr. Knizia made me take the leap.  Very different at first, because I am so used to matching every feature on a tile, but once I got used to that, I really enjoy it.  The limited space and the bonus tiles give this one a definite flavor all its own.

Knizia-Carcassonne!  I'm split on the little bonus tiles.  I really like the  way you try to target your scoring increments to get the tiles.  I don't really like the way the tiles break the rules.

I also really like the idea of the rook.  It's very hard to make a large house and then still finish it.  It makes for great tension.

Aug08: So here we are full circle.  I own it again, and I've played it again.  Quite enjoyable.  My thoughts did come back to it.  I might even suggest this more than regular Carc.

Jul10:  Well holy shit.  I now own a third copy.  (As in I've sold it twice before.)  But ya know what?  I played it again, and I friggin' enjoyed it.  What can I say?  I like the extra little bits it throws in for 2 players.  It also doesn't have stupid farm crap from the orig Carc.

I liked this game better than the other Carc games, but not much.  The confined area forces some choices that the other game didn't, but this is completely offset by te fact that only roads have to match when placing tiles.  However, even with Knizia's influence my wife and I found this to be just another dull Carc game.  It has quickly become clear that Carc is not our thing.  

If you're looking to buy a Knizia tile laying game, get Samurai, E & T, or TtD  instead.

A decent representative of the Carcassonne family.

Two new twists (bonus tiles and the largest Keep (finished area of connected houses)) keep the tension high and cause sometimes brutal competition.

Not bad but my least favorite of any Carcassonne version so far. The corner pieces can serious unbalance this game. In the one game I played, one player got none and the other four. Guess who won? And they made a big difference (2xkeep,  5, double turn used to grab last two tiles)

RATING: 7
Two player Carcassone stand alone game. Players are now restricted to playing tiles into city walls. Pawns can be played on towers, houses, roads or courts (=courtyards). The tile adjacency rules have been loosened slightly so now only roads have to be continued from tile to tile, but it's still tricky. Bonus chits for hitting certain spaces on the victory point track add a nice element of decision making when deciding when/how to score. Different enough to warrant owning.

Fantastic - arguably my favourite Carcassonne variant, and my own personal gateway game, having previously not played a boardgame since my 1830 and Supremacy marathons as a student 15 years earlier. It was the first Knizia game I'd ever played, too, so it holds a special significance for me.  

Much more focused than regular carcassonne, it's much more of a gamers game than the other variants. A wealth of strategic options beckon at every turn, and it's quick enough to drive that 'one more game?' addictiveness that often keeps me and the wife playing until the wee small hours. 

One caveat; if you start with this version, vanilla carcassonne will seem a little simple and lacking in options by comparison!

I just lowered my rating by 0.25 after my 3rd play... luck of the draw in this game seemed to have a bigger than normal affect on the outcome. I had done everything right, was the only one collecting the bonus chits, and had myself setup for significant scoring in multiple locations... but the placement rule for roads for the last 1/4 of the game wouldn't let me place!  I believe it was only an abnormally though so still highly recommend it as a really good 2-player game by Knizia.

Carcassonne variant game, where two players place tiles, only now *inside* the walls of the city. Players place meeples on tiles in order to control towers, houses, streets and market squares. The city wall is also the scoring track, and landing on certain spaces yields special tokens for the player in question. A very interesting addition to the Carcassonne family, with many recognizable rules, but also many new, intriguing features.

a two player only variant of the classic carassone. Fun and different, but essentially the same game. Not as well done as the base game either and loses its two player only luster after a couple of plays and having to use rules that are just slightly different from the base game that make playing it somewhat inconvenient. But because it is Carcassone, its still not bad.

7 - Good game, usually willing to play. **THIS IS THE ONE TO PLAY FOR TWO** This is a good game and a nice variation on the Carcassonne line. Kinza takes the basic premise and inverts it. You now have to deal with collapsing space as you are restricted by an outer wall (which doubles as a scoring track and 'special powers' pick up zone). The 'special' tiles you can collect add to the game. I really like it for two. Break out a nice light dinner by candle light, stoke up the fire place, bring out the fruit and cheese platter, a nice flagon of wine, and a personal game of 'Cracassonne - The Castle' for a romantic evening...why is it romantic? The room (board) gets smaller and you get pushed closer and closer together, all the pieces interlock and 'match' up in harmony, and when the last piece is placed you'll be kissing like the Lady and the Tramp over a shared noodle....ok, it's a game, but it's fun for two and the version of Carcassonne I break out when there's only two players or I need to teach someone the basic system before they play full on, full contact, bloody carcassonne (the original + expansions) en masse.

By far the best of the Carcassonne games, (all of which played best with no more than 3 anyway.)  There are multiple roads to victory, and the constrained board forces a fair bit of interaction.  My favorite bit is the pull betweeen gaining points in bunches, and doing it in pieces.  Ignore the corner bonus tiles at your own risk!

The Castle is wonderful 2p incarnation of Carcassonne, with enough twists and differences to make for a pleasant experience. The tile placement rules may initially take a shift in your thinking if you've played the original, but once they click they make sense for this version. The bonus tiles placed on the wall sections make the game so much more interesting as both players vie to calculate precisely to nab them first (or perhaps ignore them and make the biggest plays possible). While the base game plus expansions with 3-4p is still the definitive Carcassonne experience, The Castle makes playing anything else in the Carcassonne family with 2p obsolete.

This 2-player Carcassonne is a streamlined version of the original game.  The obvious differences are: an enclosed terraine by way of castle walls, a clear and concise scoring system (no farmers!) and a random selection of bonus wall tiles.  This version has a great look to it and IMHO a better overall feel than previous releases.  -Sold

Cool two player Carcassonne variant where things don't have to match-up. I think the bonus chips that are placed on the score board help to change the way the game is played also. My friend will pretty much always attempt to score so that he gets a bonus chip even if it means less points. However, the game seems balanced enough that the winner isn't always the player with the most bonus chips.

Compared to plain Carcassonne, the wall tiles and the biggest house bonus add more dimensions to think about. Classic multi-dimensional Knizia scoring, to name it. While the amount of options and the depth of gameplay is increased, the game at the same time feels less streamlined and even unclean with the reduced restrictions on laying tiles. It goes so far that my girlfriend rather avoids "best" moves as they just don't feel right. Ranks a bit below plain Carcassonne as well as Hunters and Gatherers.

I think this is a nice two player variant on Carcassonne.  The same basic rules, however the walls and different ways of completing features and the limited playing space all add challenges.  Very cool.

Only played this once, but liked it very much.  The tiles on the wall are wonderful, and the feeling of being hemmed in is nicely balanced by the greater flexibility in playing tiles.  The more subdued artwork is also nice -- it makes the original Carcassonne look garish.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
What I like best about this is the bounded playing area. If you limit the available tile locations then you also limit the time spent in overanalysis. The tower tiles are a neat twist. I also like the artwork; the little people working on the tiles crack me up.

I was disappointed with this one initially. Aesthetically not as pleasing as the original Carcassonne and a bit fiddly to set up, plus the original Carc plays so well with two anyway. However, now that we have so many expansions mixed in with Carc, this has become a nice, shorter option for a two player game.

Playing this version of Carcassonne makes me realize how much I enjoy seeing the landscape tiles come together in the regular Carcassonne game.  It kind of bothered me seeing the tiles not blending together in this game.  Also, the tile size doesn't seem exactly right when compared to the walls, and I often found myself accidentally moving tiles.  Since I usually play Carcassonne with only two players anyway, I'm not sure why I would ever choose this version over the original.  Some things are clarified - for example, the farmer situation is not an issue here.  But on the whole it's more of the same.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

(based on one play) Very good Carcassonne game - the scoring is quite different and refreshing at times, though path management occasionally ground our game to a halt. Still prefer the original and H&G, but that might change after a few more plays...

Solid stand alone game in the Carcassonne family!!! A few twists make this 2-player-only game stand out as a unique Carc´ experience on its own. You have to think VERY carefully before placing your tiles, and the race around the castle walls for the bonus pieces is fun and competitive.

Seems to be quite solid.  Similar gameplay, yet feels different than 2 player Carcassonne -- you're not spending as much time "waiting for just the right tile", it's much more about knowing when to start reining in that big tower, where to deploy your followers, etc.  The wall tiles are an interesting addition, but I'm still not sure whether they add too strong of a random element to the game...

This game definitely puts the most unique twist in the family of Carcassonne games.  It actually takes some mental effort to remind yourself that the features on the tiles don't have to match up and you can almost finish your features as soon as you want.  Be careful though because space in the castle gets used up quickly.  In this version of Carcassonne you are building from the outside in as opposed to regular Carcassonne games which have you starting in the "center" and building outward.

Nagyon jó kétfős változat, tetszik, hogy a várfal keretet ad, egyben rákényszeríti a feleket, hogy ne egymástól távol tevékenykedjenek. A pontozósávos bónuszok izgalmasak, bár én szívem szerint képpel felfelé helyezném el az elején, még izgalmasabbá tenné a döntési helyzeteket, jobban lehetne mérlegelni egy-egy pontozás késleltetésében vagy sürgetésében. Mindenesetre remek hangulata van, egyszerű, gyors és nekem a kinézete is tetszik.

RATING: 7.5
As of May 10, 2004, this was the first Euro-game I played. 

Summary:  Lay tiles to cut off/neutralize opponent while placing your investments elsewhere on the board without withering away all of your meeples.  The castle wall serves as the score track and a boundary from which you go outside-in, resulting in huge clashes in the middle.  This is the key difference from other Carcassonnes, which wander inside-out.

Vs. Regular Carc, the double factor of being able to come off any starting point with constrained areas means it is much easier to join into opponents chains and neutralize them.  If your opponent can't handle this direct confrontration, be wary.

Pros: Cheap, Easy to teach, very good artwork, fast play-time
Cons: requires decent 3'x3' space (which seems large for two-player)
?: Highly-confrontational due to constrained area

Personally, I rate this higher than regular Carc because I am a confrontational player.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
A nice twist on the Carcassonne series. I don't find the boundary of the castle walls to be much of a limitation, but trying to plan your scoring to pick up bonus tiles along the wall is a nice touch.

In my mind, a 2-player variant on Carcassonne isn't a necessity, as pretty much all the Carcassonnes are best with two, but that doesn't mean this isn't a nice twist.

I was told, "You like exploration? You'll love Carcassonne games!" Some pointed my wife and I towards this version (or H&G). Yet when I pulled it out of the box and gave it the run-through, it felt like Dominos with some added bells and whistles. There's absolutely NO feeling of exploration here, no excitement, no suspense - just overanalytical psuedo-strategy bookended by luck. I would have liked the theme if there was some reason to CARE what my followers did, but since the followers don't do anything (but squat in the biggest/longest whatever), that fell flat too.

Knizia meets Carcassonne. Great! different forms, different methods (should I finish this large tower and not get any of the following 3 action tiles or should I build only a little house?), a lot more tactics. Really like it still, while the original Carc version is only collecting dust now.
And as for the graphics, I have heard "it is the ugliest one". It is simply not true. Yes the buildings have a different shape - with reason -, and it is really fun to see life, animals and people in the court.

A very fun game, and one we played repeatedly after purchasing.  The more we played, however, the more luck-based the games seemed to become:  one of us would get nine of the markets, or would get about 40 points off the "double tower" tile.  I still greatly enjoy it, and the luck factor at least gives me an excuse after losing.

Update:  After playing the City, which doubles the strategy and halves the luck, this one hasn't seen nearly as much light.

Another great 2-player game. This one is a little wacky, especially if you've played Carcassonne before. The fact that the tiles do NOT need to be placed next to similar tiles is quite confusing. Once that early confusion is rectified, the game is engaging.

RATING: 6
This is a unique two player standalone version of [GAMEID=822].  However, there is a [b][i]BIG[/i][/b] problem for us---the tile placement rules are relaxed in the Castle. In the original Carcassonne game, all tiles have to match their all of their edges with all adjacent tiles in order to be placed. This results in relatively intuitive placement that taps into the jigsaw puzzle solving portion of the brain---city edges have to meet up with city edges, roads to roads, fields with fields. In contrast, in the Castle, roads are the only features that have to be matched on the tile edges. So a tower edge can be placed directly next to a house edge. Any tile edge can be placed next to the wall, even the road just ends at the wall.

Especially coming from Carcassonne first, this totally messes with your mind. When you place a tile, you instinctively try to match up the edges. It’s a total paradigm shift in Carcassonne, and while it was probably necessary to counteract the effect of shrinking playing space, it’s not necessarily for the better. Since the tile edges no longer have to match, it can be confusing---my girlfriend kept trying to place tiles that were “shifted by half a tile” rather than the whole edge since many tile edges share half Keep or House features. Aesthetically, this results in a multi-colored jumble compared to the nicer, more attractive flowing art of Carcassonne. Additionally, one of the main sources of competition in Carcassonne is stealing other people’s features by connecting more of your meeples to it. With the relaxed tile placement rules, one would think it would be easier to steal features in the Castle, but in fact it feels harder since it’s much easier for your opponent to place a tile and just block you out since they can play just about any tile against yours. As a result, this feels like you’re losing a major source of confrontation.

[GAMEID=822] is a lot more flexible, since it can support more players and you can mix and match expansions to tailor the gameplay.  It’s also more attractive, thematic, less complex, and as a result easier to get into for newbies. It may not be fair to compare Carcassonne plus expansions to the standalone [GAMEID=7717] game, but overall we think you get more fun out of the original game despite the extra cost that it's worth it.  The best audience is likely to be experienced gamers looking to go back to a more thoughtful Carcassonne game, or players who are more comfortable with more analytical, abstract games.

A very good and tense two-player game - easily my favorite Carcassonne version.  Competition can be very nasty!  Update:  I've played this so many times over several years now, mostly with my daughter - I've watched her grow over countless plays.  This game remains one of our favorites, a "daddy/daughter" event that we share to this day.  How can I give this one a low rating?  My original rating was a "7."  I raise it to a "9" simply because Carcassonne: The Castle has proven itself nearly invaluable to my family.  Some games work out that way, don't they?

I like this version of Carcassonne more than the regular one.  The theme is stronger to me (building a city within the castle walls rather than a sprawling countryside that ends when the tiles run out), and the bonus tiles acquired along the edges can change things up a bit, and encourages faster building (to get them before the other player does).

Didn't get around to writing anything here for 19 plays! Huh.
Well, I very much enjoy Knizia's take on the Carc series, how he both constrained the game (within the walls of the castle) and opened it up by giving more freedom in tile placement. Scoring on the wall, with the bonus tiles you can claim, is interesting, though sometimes makes the game a bit swingy as some of those are very much better than others - though some are awesome when you get them some games and useless in others. That seems OK in a quick light tile laying game like this one. I also appreciate how it is nicely self-contained, as Carc became rather bloated.

Wow! what an amazing difference in play from the original. We really like this version. The constraining walls and the ability to start new tiles on the edges makes the game more interesting, as there is action occurring on multiple fronts. The dynamic of getting bonus tiles if you LAND on a particular score is wonderful - you find yourself playing in order to achieve a local score, sometimes at the expense of a larger long-term score. It is hard to get used to only having to match roads, but it really frees up the tile placement. All in all, this is our favorite Carcassonne game - particularly since we usually play with two anyway.

I love Carcassonne.  I have a number of expansions and enjoy playing the different combinations of them.  However, "The Castle" is my favorite iteration of carcassonne by quite a bit.  It offers a bit more strategy over regular Carc due to the constraints of the castle walls and the subtle, yet different enough, scoring methods.  The added wall tiles add a significant change to how one must play the game as it is almost necessary to acquire some of these to win. 

Due to the confined playing area as a game mechanic the game is generally 40-50 min max depending on how deeply players consider their turns.  

At first glance "The Castle" looks like a fun skin for normal Carc with a fence around it.  But one play of this game and it's clearly a very different game.  And for me personally, more fun.  

The only drawback for some (though not me) is that it is 2-player only.

I really enjoy this one.  If you already own Carcassonne, I feel that this is still a safe purchase.  You get right into the game being familiar with the mechanics, but to me if feels quite different.  The way it scores makes it very interesting too.  You gotta collect those wall tiles, so you're often looking for ways to score a specific number of points quickly.

This is a better game (in our opinion) than basic Carcassonne, but it turns out we just don't like Carcassonne in general. Part of that is that someone can push their way into what you've built and take it, part of it is the luck of the tile draw, and part of it is that we just didn't feel like there were enough exciting or interesting choices.

Of all of the Carc versions I have played, this one was the biggest disappointment.  There are too many different places to put tiles leading to AP.  Scoring is too chaotic.

My current favorite version of Carcassonne.  Knizia's rendition turns the original game on its head: instead of building out from a starting tile, you build inward.  The scoring track also adds some strategy as players try to get the exact scores required to land on the special tiles that give you bonus actions/points.

By far the cleverest carcassonne with the most interesting decisions to be made each turn. But its still just carcassonne and has many of the same problems, eg randomness, but for the price and time commitment required itd be hard not to recommend this game.

Much less forgiving than the base Carcassonne, and roads are much more powerful, as they really dictate what other tiles can be placed around.  Important to score things and close them off quickly.

Like the bonus tiles - they add a nice element to the game.  Tile placement requires a very different logic to base Carcassonne (where it is just a case of matching edges).  Here only roads need to be matched, and as the different tile features are broken up into quadrants, it can be a little unclear for first timers on how everything needs to fit together.  

This change in logic as compared to base Carcassonne threw me every time I played and was one of the reasons I traded it on.  Prefer the base game.

This is the best of the Carcassonne games that I've played. The thing that sets it apart is that only the roads need to match on adjacent tiles. This gives the player useful options for almost every tile drawn. This is an excellent two player game.

I love my brother. He gave me this and the mini-expansion for Carcassonne/Hunters & Gatherers for Christmas (2004?). Lots of fun; the strategy is quite different than regular Carcassonne as there are fewer tiles, so you don't have as much time to fix any mistakes you've made. It was hard to get used to not having to match all the types of building!

The game feels like it takes the Carcassonne formula and tweaks it in a way that I find a lot less interesting. It also doesn't look as good. And the track on the outside of the board for scorekeeping and bonuses is a detriment in my opinion.

That Knizia's a genius.  He took a game I could take or leave (Carc) and tweaked it just enough to make it one I'll probably never refuse to play.  Unless I'm, like, really really sick...or someone else is suggesting Modern Art instead.  THEN I'd probably refuse.

Carcassonne with a cutthroat twist.  I like that.  It's still fun and much better than Carcassonne : The City.  In all the games, I prefer Vanilla Carcassonne though.  If you pick your tile in advance, it can speed up gamplay and still be cutthroat enough.

A very good two player Carcassonne variant. The more "leeway" you have in matching / not-matching the edges of tiles gives a lot more to think about; the same is also true of the restricted nature of the Castle (you are building in a pre-set walled-in area).

The way scoring works is that you are given bonuses for being the first to reach specific scores first - doing so will give you a bonus tile that can be used at any point or during the end-game scoring, allowing you to perhaps score an unfinished features or do a double-placement. If you lament the randomness of these bonuses you could always play with them open from the start which I would recommend to add even more strategy to this version.

Overall, it's still as mean as regular Carcassonne can be, but in a less direct fashion - I think completing your opponents features or cutting of areas for the features to grow into is the primary way of interaction. Taking over features I don't see happening that much, it's fairly easy to prevent the connection of two features, but simply the threat of doing so is a very worthwhile move.

Get it if you are just going to play Carcassonne with two anyway, or if you really want a slightly more strategic two-player experience than what other versions of Carcassonne can offer.

RATING: 8
I think H&G is a better Carc game, but Castle is right up there.  The walls give the game a different tone.  It feels like more of a puzzle than the Original & H&G.  Still one of the better 2-player only games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
After 136 plays. Reiner Knizia does Carcassonne. My favorite Carcassonne game. More strategically involved/subtle than the other Carcs. Also a touch more confrontational (which I like), though it doesn't look quite as pretty on the table as others versions. 

To be good, you have to watch what special tiles your opponent has and adjust your defensive play accordingly. Adds depth and variation. 

If I memorized the identity of all the tiles and tracked tile usage in the game it would probably make the experience even better. But I'm not going to take the time to do that. I might try 3-tile hands at some point. 

Weakness: If a player grabs a couple of wall-tiles by chance early before her opponent it can be a bit run-away leader-ish, but not overwhelmingly so. 

An 8 is way above average for the games I've rated (average for me is 5.5) - it gets this high rating because my ladylove and I keep returning to it after well more than 100 games. It's our go-to pub game - it works in that context because it's profoundly smooth and unfussy. It provokes exactly the feel it's intended to provoke.

Incidentally this is also probably my best board game investment ever. Bought it for $1 at a yard sale, so at this point I'm at less than one cent per play.

Poor man's Carcassonne. The original game is amazing with 2 players, so creating this 2-player specific version is redundant. The game is also designed poorly - the tile designs aren't clear and we had to make house rules about basic things such as where roads were meant to start + end.

Decent addition to the Carcassonne line.  My wife has destroyed me each time we've played, so obviously I haven't got it figured out quite yet.  I think I waste too much effort trying to pick up the special tiles, while she gets them only if she happens to land on them.  My son played me, and he won the first game, so either I suck or he has an aptitude for it.

RATING: 7
Knizia's twist on Carcassonne is very well done, although to be honest I rarely get this to the table - maybe because it is 2 player?

The placement rules are far simpler than standard Carcassonne, with more varied opportunities for scoring. The scoring options are also well balanced (unlike farmers in standard Carcassonne).

The castle walls force a nice level of player interaction. I much prefer this version to the basic Carcassonne.

A space-constrained 2-player Carc variant.  Knizia adds some other 'stuff' in there (special actions on score board, 2x road-point fountains, etc) that seem to mix up the game.  The pace of the game is a bit tighter than Carc -- space constraints means it's harder to complete some pieces.  Not sure if this is necessarily better than 2-player base Carc, though.

Comparing this to a two-player session of carcassonne, you will need to use your brains a lot more. It is still luck depending but you have a lot more interesting choices to make. Because of that it can slow the game down a bit... but then again, you only have to wait for the other player. The choices are never too hard though.

What I personally like a lot is that there are a lot less limitations for laying tiles. Only roads have to line up. You rarely get stuck with a tile that only fits in one spot. 

Regular carcassonne gives you sometimes plenty of option but you can immediately see which option will score you the most points. Here that is different. Because scoring less can sometimes give you a bonus.

Carcassonne still has the edge because you can play in almost any group.

In my opinion, even as a 2-player game, the regular Carcassonne beats this one. There is less interaction, until the very end of the game.

If you want to play the Carcassonne "system" with just 2 players, this is the only way to do it. Save the great C: The City, C: South Seas or C: Amazonas for 3 or 4. Reiner Knizia's take is magnificent. Beautiful to look at. Always a delight to play. Plays fast. Easy to teach. A real win-win all around. Too bad it is OOP. But look for a copy & it can be yours. :)

This is a solid two player game. The race to pick up the track scoring bonuses takes a little weight off of the build the biggest house strategy. As well, the mechanic where the space not filled helps you score at the end of the game is ingenious. Note: 2 player game ONLY.

For me the best of the Carcassonne family besides Carcassonne. Designed as a purely two-player game 'Castle' has the best looking board of all encompassed within the jigsaw walls. Added twist of bonus chits that are randomly placed on the victory point track around the Castle wall.

 Great first impression, possibly our favorite 2-player Carc. I like the way you don't have to line up all the features like in other games of the series, and I like the bonus tiles scattered around the scoring track. It's playtime of about 45 minutes is just right.

Knizia trumps the original with some interesting placement twists and enriched scoring options.

Relaxing tile-laying game that puts the Knizia spin on the venerable franchise. I won my first game with a ridiculously lucky draw off the wall, but now that we know how powerful those tiles are I suppose we'll go after them more intentionally. I like that there's a couple "expansions" worth of additional material here, so you're more than just the basic Carcassonne experience here. Add to that building inward and the keep scoring, and you've got something somewhat more interesting than the original.

Carcassonne: Castle is misunderstood because it is so different from the other Carcassonne titles. Knizia really turned this one on its ear, but he did very little to make the new goals explicit and if you play it like any other Carcassonne game it's dull.

In a typical Carcassonne, there's not much incentive to close things off and most players just plop dudes down on features for the long-haul and work on making them bigger and bigger over the course of the game until risk of incompletion sets in.

Knizia's radical change in tile design from edges to corners makes it very difficult to complete big features because the number of openings grows with size. In the other games, you can enlarge features ad infinitum without changing the number of openings.

The heart of Carcassonne: Castle is controlling the size of features without letting them get out of hand, so that you can complete them at exactly the right moment and size to collect the bonus tiles on the score track. This requires much different tactical play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A nice two-player edition of the game. I think I prefer this one over the basic set. The chits on the walls are a nice mechanic because maxing out your score on a turn is not always the best move. Landing on the chits may require a lesser score than the max possible so it adds a little more decision making to the game.

Another Good Hit from Rio Grande Games....Unique game and very challenging...the inverse of Carcassonne as you build inwards from a border instead of outwards....the house concept doesn't do alot for me but the towers and roads and marketplaces make alot of sense....the bonus tiles are a good element and cause you to have to plan your scoring...since it is only a two player game (shortage of good ones) I rate it a little higher than it should be....

The Castle is a nice next step in the Carcassonne series.  I had played the original a few times and was starting to get bored with it.  The Castle adds bonuses on the scoring track which provide additional abilities if you land on them first, making you try to score specific amounts of points on a turn to land just right and earn them.  That mechanism was new to me and went over very well.  I hope to find more games that do something like that.

This is a fun two player game that plays in quick time with enough to think about.  You can play this in isolation but with such a small play area you are bound to stuff up the other players plans and in that case you should be looking to protect yourself.  The wall tiles are a great idea and add another level to your decision making

Good: Same old Carcassonne just a little bit beautiful. My girlfriend liked it a lot, so it is a plus for this luck based game.  The Wall Tiles only gives the leading player even more bonuses to crush the second player.

Reiner Knizia's contribution to the Carcasonne series is a two player game. The twist is that as you score points, you may get special tokens on the scoreboard if you land on that particular square. These tokens can be used later. Otherwise, it's Carcasonne, and you are tryihg to build a big castle.

RATING: 10
I don't understand how some people are criticizing this for being the "same old" Carcassonne. To me, after 1 play, it felt like the anti-Carcassonne in that you had to think more about how to cut things off rather than how to expand them. In some ways it reminds me of Toscana, a nice under-rated 2-player game in its own right. My opinion may change, but as much as I like this version and I'm sure it will get much play time, I still prefer Hunters & Gatherers as my 2-player game of choice. It's great to have an enjoyable alternative like this, though, to add to my collection. **** UPDATE **** After several more plays, The Castle has topped H&G for 2-player enjoyment. What I like best is that almost every tile you draw can be put to some good use and the game-within-a-game of trying to collect the bonus tiles adds a huge dimension. I don't know if the 10 rating is going to last forever, but this is a game I look forward to playing at any time.

Subtle changes to original game by Knizia, which make the game similar to the original, but magically much more appealing to "heavy" gamers.

RATING: 6
You would think that freeing up the restrictions on where tiles can be placed would make things easier - but Herr Knizia recognizes that having numerous options but only one that can be actualized is where the tension of a game comes from.  Bravo.  There's perhaps a bit too much luck associated with the bonus tiles, but the game is already a hit and the best iteration of 2-player Carcassonne out there, IMO.

--update--
Klaus-Jürgen Wrede took Knizia's lead and eased up the matching restrictions in Carc the City, making it the best Carc I've played and leading me to drop this one's rating in comparison.

It's another version of Carcassonne that provides a different way to play it, less streamlined, but a bit more tactic (but still, you draw only one tile and you have to do with it). The need to do exact points to get a bonus is what makes this game interesting. 

I think it might interest those who want to play Carcassonne against a single player. I'm not into 2 player games, I will be willing to play again, but just the online version.

Other designers must really hate Reiner Knizia. Just when you think you've perfected the perfect Euro-gateway game, he grabs hold of it, puts it in a castle, hammers out a couple of rule changes, eliminates some of the awkwardnesses imposed by the tiles, and turns it into a much, much better game. Full of inventive ways to screw your opponent out of points, and almost invariably a close-run thing right up to the finish. Damn clever.

An interesting tile game. It has some decisions to be made, but never bogs down. Easier than vanilla Carcassonne, and maybe more dependent on luck with the tile mechanism.

RATING: 7.5
It's good, but I didn't like it as much as I thought I would.  I got this in the same purchase as Ingenious, and was surprised to find I like that more for two players.  Maybe I just need to actually win, and then I'll like it...  The scoring is unintuitive at first with the various features not having to match up tile to tile, but it really is very clever.  Scoring little things to get Wall Tiles is very important as many of the tiles are more useful in the middle of the game rather than the end.  

The tile placement mechanics are perfect for the space you have, and the track itself often affects the game, especially in the little nook up around 30 points.  The pieces are fun and the game goes fast--it even seems a little short which I suppose is a lot better than seeming long.  With all of that, there's something...I can't explain what...that just keeps this game from being as exciting as Carcassonne.  I don't know.  Good game.  I'm glad I have it to play with my wife.

EDIT: This has improved with time.  The battle for largest keep and placement if you don't have it are interesting, and so is the decision whether to make a small score in order to get a wall tile or to hold off for a higher scoring tower or house and skip the wall tile.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Yes, it's 'yet another Carcassonne', but the Knizia scoring tweak (where you get good stuff but only if you land on the right spaces) adds some flavour.  As with any Carc, it's a better game when you allow players to draw multiple tiles and choose which to play instead of relying on luck of the draw.

Fantastic two player Carcassonne variant with a city wall scoreboard that offers bonuses, giving players an incentive to score a particular amount of points to claim a mystery bonus tile.

Enjoyable two-player affair.  Like it better than orginal Carc in that playing inside set boundaries makes strategy a bit more viable.  One minor problem I found however is that toward the end of the game, we drew a couple tiles that could not be placed, and removed them from the game.  Not a big deal, but when you are trying to finish a building/path, and you start counting tiles, it certainly throws a wrench in your planning.  But then again, this is a Reiner trademark.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Easy to play and a decent 30 min game, but the bonus tiles are a tad too much luck for me. Enjoyable enough, but we don't need to play again. There's a surface illusion of it being non-gamery which crumbles under repeat play (which may be great for other couples but we enjoy lighter contests) plus it can be one-sided if one player ekes off all the chips.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Nice game.  Makes it easier to play the tiles which adds a lot when only with 2 players.  The wall adds an extra twist.

Great 2 player game and Carcassonne variant! Compete for bonuses laid out on the scoring track which is atop the castle walls! Very cool! Might be considered more abstract than vanilla Carc due to the fixed wall constraints.

Dr. Knizia helped make this.

Need a few plays before you can improve your play and plan scorings better.  Scoring for this game is different than in regular Carcassonne. 

This standalone is not compatable with other Carcassonne games.

I liked this game a lot. I think it's easy to overlook the subtleties though, which is why this game might have done not so good, especially among carcassonne fans. I like the way several expantions of the original have been integrated and how the rules where adapted to better suit a competitive 2-player carcassonne game. I think the problem with the original as a 2-player game is that, since the game is not confined to a limited area, players tend to builto each in different directions, so there's not too much interference as in this one, since here, the playing area is limited by a mold, there is no other options really, other then trying to steal away the opponents' road, or tower or house. The fact that you can obtain the wall tiles by landing your score counter directly on it is interesting as well, since in this game, other then in the original carcassonne, you don't simply score as much as you can with every meeple, but you actually try to count how far away from the next wall tile you are and try to score those exact points. One thing that might feel confusing is that there are no restrictions towards how you extend the houses, the towers and the courts; players simply can place these side-a-side with no restrictions, only the roads follow the carcassonne standart rules in that they need to be given continuity. This mind feel weird at first, but I feel this was a good call in terms of how the rules reflect the game play, since, as mentioned before, the designer opted in narrowing down the playing area for a more competitive game, if the placement rules were the same as the original game, players would most likely very soon by out of options when trying to fin a place to play the tiles they'd be drawing... So in all, I can understand that people out there find this game a lesser version of carcassonne, me myself though, after carefully considering all these adaptations and subtle rule changes... consider this to be actually a quite worthy adition to the carcassonne familly and a better options for two players over the original game.

Different enough from the original and from H&G to be a worthwhile addition to your collection.  After two plays, I'm still haven't quite figured out how to play well; part of it involves the new what-can-be-next-to-what system (ie, only the roads need to match).  The scoring track bonus tiles are a nice touch.

Somehow, I don't get the same sense of achievement from making a castle as the landscapes in Carcassonne. I think this is because the tile placement rules are more loose and the patterns that are produced aren't as visually attractive. The gameplay's still pretty good, albeit a bit random.

I like it as a nice twist to the Carc family.  It's harder to get used to the different placement rules, however eventually works.  I love and hate the castle wall bonus tiles, as they add the competitiveness however can have also have a bigger than desired effect in the game.

Very well done, probably better balanced then the original one. There are a few ideas that are very original and make this game a very good one. I don't understand why Reiner Knizia made this game only for two players. As negative points, the mechanics are almost identical (although retouched a bit), but the new tiles IMHO take away most of the beauty and fascination of the original game. It's more abstract and more well balanced, as we could expect from Reiner Knizia. Less fascinating, as we could maybe expect from Reiner Knizia.

Good game. Better than normal Carc. More options since it is far easier to place the tiles. Also there are a lot of competition to get first to the bonus tiles, so you actually have plenty of incentive to only get small points now and then to land exactly on the right VP space. A lot of minor goals makes for a more interesting game right from the start. If I hadn't played so much normal Carc. this would be at least an "8".

After playing the original Carcassone so often, it took a bit of getting used to seeing the new tiles and the new rules.  I do like the additional features like the bonus tiles on the scoring tiles.  Still, an enjoyable game, but possibly not as addictive as the original game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
(5+ plays)

A fun version of Carcassonne, and some fun back and forth battling for the scoring tiles.  It's missing the puzzly part of Carc, so I don't like it as much for that.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
30 minutes - Carcassonne 2p with good player interaction and a race around the scoring track as certain places on the scoring track have bonus tiles. First to land on a scoring space gets the bonus (must land directly on the space to get the bonus, so it somewhat affects strategy in a reactive sense)

Bounding the play area with the castle wall is different but I wouldn't say it's better or worse. The bonus tiles are hidden until revealed by landing on them, so they don't affect strategy as much as they could, though they may impact your strategy; for instance: if you get a "score one unfinished castle" bonus tile, you might stop trying to close an unfinished castle that your competitor has partially blocked, and go work on other areas. 

It's a good tile laying game and it increases both player interaction and optional scoring mechanics. but there's something beautiful in the simplicity of base-set Carcassonne that this game lacks. If I could only have one Carcassonne for 2p, it would probably be the original. If you've never played Carcassone, start with the original.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I think it's better than the original Carcassone. But the maximum number of players is only 2.

RATING: 7
Probably the best of the Carc series that I've played.  I only like Carc 2-player, so that helps a lot.  The wall tiles add a nice strategic element, and the amount of plays for a tile nicely DECREASES as the game goes on rather than increases, adding to the tactical play.  Really makes Carc a much more interesting game.

Nice rendition of the Carcassonne idea. For our first try, it was easy to figure it out, as the variations on the basic Carcassonne principles are easy to understand. My wife really liked it, and that is a great plus, as this is the perfect type of game for us to share together. It will definitely see a lot of table time.

RATING: 6.5
Fun game, but not as good as regular Carc with expansions in my opinion.  2 of the draws of carc are 1) making your own "board"/map and 2)the puzzle like enjoyment of matching up the pieces.  Both are largely missing here.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.3
An excellent 2 player game, the castle wall makes the game be limited to that space which makes it better, the score is marked along the wall and there´s bonus tiles in some numbers and you have many ways to score points which makes the game much more attractive and competitive.

RATING: 7.15
Good 2 player only stand-alone version of Carcassonne by Knizia. A Wall/Scoring-Track surrounds the play area, and players race to get bonuses along the track. Tiles are placed working from the outside-in, which increases competition as players are forced to place tiles near each other.

This 2p Carc game I had been wanting to play for a while. I like that it is only 2p and pretty cut throat. I have only played it one time so far and I learned a lot in that one play. I definitely see why people enjoy it and I really want to play it a few more times to see if I want to keep it. So far not my favorite carc but definitely has me interested. It has that Knizia twist that you feel is different than the other carc games. I am still undetermined at the moment though.

RATING: 7
The Good Doctor has put a much needed stranglehold on this runaway franchise in more ways than one: it's limited to 2 players (less downtime) and less tiles (shorter playing time, but shame the distribution isn't visually uniform), and more importantly there are boundaries (so limiting placement options as the game progresses). Despite such restritions there is the freedom of tiles only needing to match with the roads so less chance of being stuck with a bad tile, but does add some spacial thinking. Strangely in this Knizia design even the scoring has been cut back,you only need to monitor completed houses, roads and towers earn points (even the visually confusing "farms" have been substituted with easily sighted market icons). But......you can score incomplete features if you can land on such bonus markers placed along the scoring track. This is the most interesting element of play and really kicks the other Carcassonne titles back into the dark ages.

Carcassonne was my gateway to this wonderful hobby and I was interested to see Knizia’s take on the system. I think he’s done a great job of taking it up a notch, with some short term tactical goals (the wall tiles) and some long term strategic ones (the keep). I thought I might find the roads-only matching weird, and it was quite hard to get to grips with at first, but I like how it opens up the possibilities of each tile. My wife likes this too so it should get a fair amount of table time.

Fantastic 2 player game. It takes the positive quatities of Carcassonne, quality components, beautiful artwork, ease of play, and short length, and adds layers of clever decision making and player interaction. Can add another player (with borrowed meeples) just by putting wall tiles on both triangular corner spaces (a couple of these can be somewhat unbalancing).

An interesting rendition of classic Carcassonne which takes what is unique about Carcassonne (the freeform tile laying) and turns it on its head by introducing the spatial restriction which offers new strategic problems and perspectives. I like the scoring system and the random bonuses mix it up a little and break up the traditional non-luck Euro flow of the original game.

Very good 2-Player game. We love Carcassonne and Knizia so we thought this would be a good mix. The scoreboard/map space is very cool visually and makes for tough decisions within the game as well. Trying to decide between scoring big numbers or aiming for the bonus tiles is tough. The battle for the largest home territory is always interesting and being able to use a turn to block/sabotage your opponent is an interesting option. Not much to complain about here. Easy for me to recommend if you can find a copy.

At last, a decent two-player Euro game. Far meatier and nastier than the standard Kosmos fare.

I love this game.  Interesting, attractive, and maybe I am just not very smart, but I think it is reasonably deep.  This was my introduction to the whole Carcassonne family, and a "gateway" game for me.  Nearly a year, and probably 25 new games later, it remains among my favorites.  

My only complaint is that it is difficult to know who is winning until after the end of the game, since so many points are awarded at the conclusion.  Some people like this feature -- just not me.

Could've been a great Carcassonne alternative, but the tile art doesn't create a very nice or clear design and makes scoring more difficult than it should be.

Standalone game, similar rules to Carcassonne. The scoring track is a great touch, a game within the game.

Knizia brings a few nice touches to aN already brilliant game. *Probably* worth keeping in addition to Carcassonne original.

One of my favorite Carcs, I like the use of the score track to give out bonus points.

Comes a close second to H&G. Sadly not as pretty. There is more to this game than the usual Carcassonne. An excellent two-player variant from Dr. Knizia.

RATING: 8.5
Very good 2-player adaptation of Carcassonne. I prefer the original by a very slight margin - maybe just because it was my first German game. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.25
Easy to explain to anyone who's played Carcassonne.  Not a bad variant, but not materially different than playing Carcassonne with 2p (which I think works ok).  Framing out the board causes some more challenges during play, which can be interesting.  Slightly more strategy than in 2p Carcassonne.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Far more visually appealing than vanilla - how can you not love the little dudes riding pigs? - I also love the way that it encourages much more logical building, somewhat counter-intuitively in spite of the less restricted spacing rules. Scoring system has crazy randomness, which evens the playing field in a way that demand fun.

I prefer playing Carc on a limited space table anyway, so the castle actually seems somewhat spacious.   

Copy I have played had some sub-standard production -eg, peeling tiles, and very poor fit on the 'jigsaw' pieces.

We play it more often than the normal Carcassonne nowadays. Very good two-player-game and nicely balanced.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I've played just about all the Carcassonne games now and this is the one I've enjoyed the most. I had almost overlooked it because I'd just put in the same basket as all the other Carcassonne variants and expansions being churned out - I'm very happy I took the time to give it a whirl though. Nice incentives along the points track and doing away with the cloisters reduces the tile luck somewhat. I've revised my score upwards a couple of times (after a few games), as I've enjoyed the clever little moves one can make.

Often my wife and I play the variant where roads are not allowed to drive straight into the wall. Makes for a tighter game where it's harder for your opponent to block off a growing investment - harder for you to finish it off too.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Ok, I like the bonusses on the score track (why hasn't this idea been used in more games?) and the endgame bonus worth the largest empty space for one of the player...
That said, I don't like the very fact that roads are the only landscape that need to connect from tile to tile. Ok within the limited space, it would else have been impossible, but that kills the Carcassonne feeling for me, and my opinion of the game in the same time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I'm not sure that I really like the bonus chits. One lucky draw can decide a game. This is the least good game in the Carcassonne series. I have yet to see tight and exciting game. Most games are won by a clear marging by one player.

RATING: 8
I like this better than the Original and Hunters and Gatherers.  There are more ways to score, like the Keep at the end of the game, and the bonus tiles on the scoring track.  Almost every tile has me questioning as to ether use it to cut my opponents score down or build on my own.  Many more decisions to make than the bigger Carc games, highly recommended for a two player game.

RATING: 3
Felt very different from regular Carcassonne, and I had to rethink my regular Carcassonne strategies. Seems like a much more subtle game in general. Like the frame, wall bonuses, controlled game length and houses. Don't like the artwork, rigid geometry and the game being 2-player only (especially since all versions of Carcassonne play well with 2). The geometry of the artwork (squares) and lax placement rules seem to make this version have a more abstract, spatial  feel (think Quads).

2+1
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
My wife beat me in the first game of this we played and now she refuses to play again :)  It has quite a different feel than Carcassonne, with greater variability in tile placement.  However, the much shorter game means that we could not wait as long for things to pan out as in our regular games of Carcassonne.  Also, I'll have to make a greater effort to fill in empty spaces, particularly when I'm not going to get the points for them.  One problem area that seems to require focus is the spur off to the left near the top of the castle.   
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.4
The only Carcassonne I've played, and I highly recommend it!

I mostly game with my significant other, and this game is delightfully quick, fun and strategic for both of us.

We love the puzzley aspect of joining the roads combined with the variety of scoring options.

Some moves can be harsh on the other player- but no hurt feeling to report so far!

Favourite moment: the point when both players realize the endgame is approaching and madly scramble to finish their incomplete structures.

If you don't like [thing=822]Carcassonne[/thing], you may like this.  The walls enclosing the playable area add one dimension.  The wall tiles on the scoring track add another.  Requiring only that roads connect adds another.  "Do I place this tile here to score only three points but collect a wall tile, or do I guarantee six points over there?"  One of my favorite two-player games.

Ok game but not really at all like Carc.Just doesn't really do anything.

Just played after a long break-better than before! I find I  have to readjust my thinking when playing this as opposed to Carcassonne.This is partly due to not knowing the tiles that are in the game and the manner in which the buildings are not so much completed but restricted in their size.

I easily prefer this to normal Carc face to face.

 This is  an interesting and absorbing game.

[14 plays] A tremendous 2 player game! Best of the Carcs. There are opportunities to pursue your own strategy and occasionally mess with your opponent's. Reiner cleaned up the game and worked his magic on the Carc system. Not deep, but really fun. Easily taught and understood.

Most recent play 8-8-10 with Garrett.

RATING: 6
Carc is carc is carc is carc even though this is by Kniza. It's carc set within the confines of a wall. Most elements are the same. There are useful extra effect tiles that players can take (if their scoring meeple lands on one on the scoring track) and subsequently use. Ok game. Weird connecting shapes though!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Solid, terrific variation of Carc - way better than the tepid jumble called Hunters and Gatherers. Variance placement adds more study time but makes the game richer. Wall tiles are a great addition! Herr Knizia did what you would expect - made it more of a thinking game - and that's a good thing!

My favorite Carcassone sequel/expansion thus far.  I don't like playing 2 player Carcassonne, so this one fills a need for me.  There's a lot more ways tiles can be placed, so it gains in strategy what it loses in the group dynamics of a multiplayer game.  It can be very frustrating in a good way.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
The game appeared underdeveloped and, at times, it felt broken. A poor addition to the Carcassone family. An attempt to 'cash in' perhaps? One of the worst Knizia efforts in years. Not recommended. 

Knizia has bungled. Surprisingly poor.

A friend had rated it as a '1'.

After getting knocked out of a small poker tournament early, I played this with a friend who'd been looking to get it to the table for several months.  Being a little inebriated, the directions would have been confusing if we hadn't have played the original Carcassonne before.  We got going quickly and had a grand time.

I actually prefer this one to the original.  It plays significantly quicker and due to the heads-up play, there were a lot more opportunities to deny your opponent.  This ought to become a popular title in our group for those times when two people are waiting for the rest to show up.

RATING: 6.5
I think it's hilarious that the "You Might Also Enjoy..." section lists Queen's Necklace in bold. Ha! They do not seem at all similar to me.

In Carcassonne - The Castle, players are placing tiles inside a walled perimeter, which also cleverly serves as the scoring track. Tile placement is a little different than vanilla Carc, but easy enough to pick up. There is an interesting tactical element in that certain bonus tiles are located in key places along the scoring track, and you get these special tiles if you are the first to land on them. So it can pay to get a specific amount of points at certain points in the game. I like the fact that this version of Carc is a little bit more thought-intensive than other versions, but we've discovered a problem with it when contrasted with regular Carcassonne. In Carcassonne, you have the ability to make a strong comeback at the end if you play the farming game well. In Carc the Castle, a player who establishes a truly dominant lead early is pretty likely to win - so much so that the end game is extremely anti-climactic about 50% of the time. Some games, we're just tempted to quit after playing 2/3 of the game. That's no fun.

Although I love the original, The Castle edition leaves something to be desired for me.  I'm not really a fan of two player games, so this is probably my biggest problem with The Castle.

I like it somewhat, but it's a struggle to have the score as even as possible so the other player doesn't get all of the bonus score tiles from the score track.

RATING: 6.8
I think this is a very interesting version of Carcassonne.  My wife and I (and our families) have enjoyed Carcassonne and it's many expansions and I thought this was a smart buy.  It does take some getting used to (not connecting houses and towers and meadows with each other) but the end game scoring is SO much simpler and the tiles make for an interesting mid-game target. 

I rate Carc a tad higher because of the scale factor.  You never know which way those tiles will fall. The Castle keeps things close - but that's also a good thing in and of itself.

The best of the Carcassonne games to date.  Many interesting decisions and plays are now incorporated into the standard Carc. formula.  The bonus tiles and their acquisition add a whole new dimension to play.  The only fault is that this version is not as "pretty" as the original or H&G, the buildings appear pretty "blocky" when completed.

Interesting Carcassonne variant. It takes some time to get used to the fact that only roads have to match, but then you'll find a really good game. Whereas regular Carcassonne starts small and grows outwards and always bigger and bigger - giving more and more options to place your tiles - this game grows inwards - giving less options as the game progresses.
Also, the scoring tiles on the track are a great incentive to build both small and large buildings/roads/et cetera.

RATING: 7
Really the only way to play two-player Carcassonne is with this game.  It's a quality tile placement game in its own right, and I enjoy playing it quite a bit.

UPDATE: I've played some really fascinating games of regular Carcassonne with some good expansions that I think would also be good with two. Still, this is a great version for fans of the game that like to play with two.

this is the first of the Carcassonne games that i've played and i really like it.

at first, it appears to be a building game, and it is. but then you notice that you must also watch what your opponent is doing, and finish their constructions before it is too late! you can also join their building, forcing them to sacrifice more meeples to defend their stake in it. the game within the game of working to collect the bonus tiles is genius. a really fun game that is easy to play and with some depth.

The game is too tightly balanced to be ruined by such marketing gimmicks.

It's both ironic and fitting that Reiner Knizia should design the best Carcassonne-variant. The constrained playing area forces players to keep watching each other's moves and makes for very tight play. Calculated scoring also becomes very important, as the bonus tiles can provide crucial advantages. Haven't played it as much as the base version and Hunters & Gatherers yet, but this surely feels a lot less repetitive.

Carcassonne designed for 2 players. The way Carcassonne was meant to be played. I like it better than the original version as it has some gimmicks that definitely improve the original: the scoring track with the special extras at specific points is worth a mention, as is the fact that it's an overall tighter and better game. Still, if you own the original plus a couple of expansions you can probably overlook it, unless you're a Carcassonne aficionado. If you don't own the original I'd get this one instead, especially since it is a great 2 player game, which after a while, compared to the original Carcassonne, will end up hitting the table more often.

If you're only ever going to play Carcassonne with two players, you might as well save the trouble and expense of purchasing the original Carc with all the game-lengthening expansions and get this enjoyable stand-alone version.  It even adds some very fun elements not to be found in the original or its expansions.  Game design: 3.5/5  Personal enjoyment: 2.5/5  Total: 6/10

RATING: 6
I feel like I'm missing something. hunters and Gatherers is the only other carcassonne game I've played and I find it to be far superior, even when restricted to two players. This game is ugly. When the game is over and you look at the game board, it looks like an unfinished and extremely poorly planned castle. Roads leading into walls and in circles, casle walls running into rooftops and ending in the midlle of open fields. I find very little competition or strategy in it. Every play seems to be choosing between a couple of poor places to place your tile and wishing you drew something more useful. The competition consists of occasionaly trying to share a resource to prevent an opponent scoring, and trying to get to specific scoring positions on the wall before your opponent. If the other carcassonne games did not exist, I would probably rate this one higher. The only worthwhile things this game brings to the table are a bit of variety and the castle wall bonus tile concept. If I didn't have friends who overvalue variety, I would have given this game away by now, not because it is a bad game, but becasue there are better games of the same type out there. I'll happily play this game, but only at anothers request.

RATING: 3
Removing most of the constraints on tile placement from original Carcassonne means there are many possible moves to consider each turn - so this can be a bit too much of a brain burner for casual play. A side-effect of relaxing the tile placement rules is also that the finished map is not as aesthetically pleasing as the other Carcassonne games. Our wall tiles/frame has also started to warp a little. The wall bonus tile mechanic is quite interesting as it adds several new tactics, including scoring your opponent points to push them past the bonuses, and foregoing a big score yourself in order to pick up the bonus tiles. However, I'm unlikely to play this again, as vanilla Carc provides a much more relaxing game in the short, 2-player casual filler category.

[u]Key Words:[/u] Spin-off - Tile Placement - Area Control - 2-Player - 30mins

[u]Summarized Opinion:[/u] This Carcassonne spin-off is not really worth playing over the original.

[u]My Rating Explained:[/u] Average game, some fun or challenge at least but nothing standing out.

[u]Verbose Assessment:[/u]

Like Hunters & Gatherers except that this is for 2 players only. It has some twists the original doesn't such as the scoring for biggest house and the bonus tiles you get by landing on certain spaces of the scoring track, but this is not really interesting tactically. The major difference is that the tile placement rules are less stringent, you can place every tile almost everywhere - the only thing you need to pay attention to is the roads. Which is my view is not really a plus.

So all in all, not very successful. The original is much better.

RATING: 7
A 2-player specific Carc variant by Reiner Knizia.  I like the wall surrounding the playing area and I also like the bonus chips.  I don't like how the builidngs are played next to each other  Its an okay game, but I'd rather play the base game with 2.  It just works better.

Very Neat.  Felt very fresh compared to Carcassonne (which I'm slightly burnt out on)  The bonus tiles on the scoring track made for a very interesting game and forced me to score for my opponent and strategically score for my self.  Go Reiner. 2006/02/17

RATING: 5.5
Seems like there's just a bit too much stuff crammed into this variant. I like the concept of having special tiles on the scoring track itself though (the wall), leaving you with the decision of sacrificing points for potential tile-rewards. Hard to get used to the messiness of being able to connect pretty much anything to anything else, roads being the only exception.

For Lia, it's her favourite game, so I played it many times. Knizia did it well, it's clearly better than the basic Carcassonne, more decisions to take, assessing the chances, etc.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Designed to be a two-player version of Carcassonne. Not half as good though. The bonus tiles are poorly balanced and the player who gets the right one usually wins. Sometimes no one will get it, but both will hunt bonus tiles anyway and "discard" a lot of turns building nothing just to score the right amount for a bonus tile. It's not really that fun if you think about it. Play the original instead!

This is Carcassonne done right. The limited number of tiles (only 30), the limited playing field (bordered by the castle walls), the collection of special abilities through score, easy "farmers", trying to make the largest keep, and the cool inverse space scoring for it. Finally a Carcassonne I can like.

The interesting thing about this game is that, at least the way we end up playing it, almost starts getting a coop feel since the board really can restrict tile placement (that and my husband as a ‘thing’ about how layouts should ‘make sense’ so he doesn’t like oddly shaped buildings). Not sure if this game will have staying power on our playlist.

Another 'new Carcassonne' that doesn't compare to the original. As pointed out by Henrik, if a player gets ahead, the bonus scoring tokens just simply help to mean that the other player can't catch up.

Carcassonne: The Castle is so superior to Carcassonne in just about every way, it's stupefying that it's been out of print at all. By removing the jigsaw puzzle aspect of the original, this game throws open the decision space and makes the game [i]so much[/i] more interesting.

The house/keep mechanic, the bonus tiles, the illusion of freedom that reveal itself to actually be self-directed levels of constraint are all ingenious. 

By the widest of wide margins, the best game in the Carcassonne franchise, and a real contender for top-tier 2-player game.

For an OOP game, it's surprisingly affordable on the secondary market. Do yourself a favor and snag a copy.

RATING: 6.9
[gameid=7717] is a highly praised 2 player Carcassonne, though in our home it fares badly compared with [gameid=4390], which is our go-to Carcassonne game.

Set-up is easy, you place the castle walls. Pick your tile and off we go. The constraints imposed by the walls make it a very defined playing area. There are gates in the walls, buildings and open areas, as a starting point. The scoring is different at the end of the game. Bonuses are awarded and the pursuit of these sometimes force you to extend a building you would perhaps have done.

At certain intervals towers are placed. If you time it right you might gain bonus tiles, which can be used during the game or in connection with the end-game scoring.

I think we feel too constrained by the walls, we rather prefer the open landscape of prehistoric times, but in its own right it is a good game.

RATING: 10
Only played once so far as it is new, and comparing to H&G which I love and is our first intro to the Carc series. I really like Castle, I like the brightness and how you can block your opponent so easily. I rarely do that in H&G as I'd rather add the tiles to improve my progress. Also like the ending of Castle and how the score can change drastically. Very fun and light but not too light. Hubby would rather play Maharaja!!

Was very excited to play this as looked like a great 2-player game. Was not as excited after playing it a couple of times. Feel like there is something missing. I want to play it again because it 'feels' like there should be something more like I'm not getting it, but I think I'm just going to be disappointed. I might have to lower the rating if this is confirmed.

As with H&G, I think they did a good job of maintaining the feel of the series, while modifying the details enough to make players have to change their perspective and strategy. I don't think this needed to be 2-player only, though, because the original and H&G play so well that way.

A great way to get some Carcassonne in when it's just me and one other person (usually my wife or my Dad).

SOLD (8/25/11) --- I had very high hopes for this game because I'm a huge fan of the original Carcassonne, love playing it with only two-players, and think Reiner Knizia is the best game designer.  However, it just didn't meet my expectations at all.  I find the rule that only roads need to match very counterintuitive, and haven't found the game particularly interesting or fun.  I'm tempted to give it a 5, but it is Carcassonne after all, so I'd still prefer to it to many other games out there.

Revised upwards; it's at least as good as regular Carc for 2. I worry that the wall tiles have a little bit of a rich-get-richer effect, but then to get the really big scores you have to skip a few. Maybe I'll decide its not a problem after a few more games.

Our gateway game, so there's a bias. We LOVE this game. Sometimes she wins, sometimes I do, we're engaged on every turn, just enough downtime to have a couple of sips, room for the kind of house rules that give a game a lived-in feel--it's a perfect light two-player game, by my standards.

Good Carcassone variant and better game for two players compared to regular Carc.

After several plays, I must say that this is a good game for two, but I still look forward to regular Carc with some of the expansions more

032611 - update on ratings, replayed this game after a long hiatus, it remains the best Carcassonne, but still a Carcassonne. I like that the walls provides a boundary to limit your choices of tile placement which makes it a little more tactical. Also, the bonus tiles, while completely luck of the draw, is fun and makes a game a little unpredictable. Still, with so many better two-player games out there, this is not a a top draw for me anymore.

RATING: 6
I'm not a big fan of the Carcassonne series. However, this game felt little better than the basic game. 

Nevertheless, I think that there is just too many possibilites in this game. Because of this, it feels to me that there is no real tension in the game. This might be because it is hard to see what would be a "good" move (or the best). 

Maybe this is just my stupidity or inexprerience - don't know yet.

Absolutely hate basic Carcassonne.  I simply do not understand why the base game gets so much love and attention.  Nostalgia?

These are all I need, thanks.

I do think this is a better version of Carcassonne (given the 2-player limitation).  It fixes many of the scoring issues and has cleaner graphic design.

Carcassonne in a predetermined space. No more having to move tables around to keep the board from falling off the table and bonus tiles which is something I like from Hunters and Gatherers and Traders & Builders. If you like Carc (and I do) then you can't help but like this.

Played once... it was okay, but even Knizia can't make it more than what it is: a Carcassonne game. Some clever ideas that I'm sure with repeated plays reveal a deeper side of CC than has been seen before (I trust the good Doctor), but I don't think these added complexities are fitting for a game like CC which works best imho in its simplest form.

To be a Carcassonne game, this plays much differently than I would have expected.  The defined playing space, the bonus tiles, the "largest house" rule, and the fact that only the roads have to line up, make this game something unique.  At first, I thought the bonus tiles could throw an advantage too much in one direction, but I didn't see that happen in my second game.  In fact, in my third game, I saw the bonus tiles give a tremendous gain to a player who seemed out of contention, enough to give him the win.   This may have been an anomaly, but I'm going to keep watching this sort of thing. As of right now, I prefer this to standard Carcassonne; I just wish it supported more players!

Pros : lot of strategy involved in placement of tiles and meeple placement. Many decisions to make; ex; block, or build for you, take fewer points to get bonus tile on edge of castle wall.
Cons: Nasty game that can screw with others plans. The tiles are not the greatest looking.

Overall: Fun game with enough strategy to allow me to recommend it to a friend but it better not be someone who cant stand you ruining their build plans.(my fiance hated the game because I screwed here out of merchant points buy out meepling her in the courtyards!!)

Good game overall, a solid win.

Knizia's two player riff of the namesake classic. Start with a pre-constructed castle wall boundary. Draw and place a tile without many placement rules except roads. Has a race feel with great scoring decisions between quick wins, big points but tying up limited meeps longer, or exact scoring on the track for bonus tokens. Still has great interaction as the original.

RATING: N/A
Carcassonne: the Castle takes place in one of the many castles you have built during a game of Carcassonne.

The players build their buildings, roads etc. inside the constrained space of the castle walls and place their followers at strategic places. By scoring exact number of points players can gain bonus points from tiles on the scoring track.

Played a few times. An interesting variation on the Carcassonne basic system, with less restrictions on tile placement. Lots of good ideas (such as the fixed "board" limits, the bonus chits, the end-game scoring of the largest remaining area) make that an enjoyable game - which I would probably favor over basic Carcassonne for 2 players.

Quite a lot like "standard" Carcassonne, but has some extra features that are interesting:

* I really like the way that the more flexible placement rules give you more strategic options.
* Collecting wall tiles is fun.
* Competing for "largest keep" is fun.

For me, this is a much better 2 player game than regular carcassonne. Overall a good medium-length 2 player game.

There's something about this version that turns my standard Carcassonne strategy on its head.  The combination of limited space with more open game play adds a new dimension to gameplay and works perfectly for two-players.  Add the race for the wall tiles and it's a fantastic variant.

Fun game for two. If I have bad draws, well the game will end soon enough that I don't break out in tears. 

My desire to play Carcassonne and variants with more than two players has really taken a nose dive recently. There is simply nothing to do. If I have drawn my new tile and know where to place it and the next person hasn't even laid their tile down, I am instantly bored.

A worthy addition to the Carcassonne series.  Knizia has taken the base rules and added a few twists.  The playing field is now limited by the castle walls, which adds some tension as the end game approaches.  Also, there are bonus tiles along the scoring track, which means you must decide, should I go for the big score... or the small 3 pointer that will land me a bonus tile.

It's a fine Carcassonne variant, but... why does it exist? Carcassonne is fine as it is!

This is a nicely done version of Carcassonne.  It's really well balanced, but it bothers me a little that tile placement doesn't have to "make sense."

Very quick game, great filler when there isnt alot of time.  Fun to play (it's carcassone after all) and id say even a bit lighter than carcasonne.

Great game that I wish I could get my wife to play more often.  For some reason, she just doesn't get it and it isn't fun for her.

It is more interesting than the normal carcassonne because there are more things to think of. With the expansions the normal carcassonne is better. But this version does not take so long to play it.

Tend to like the originals better, especially Hunters & Gatherers, however, this is a fun one too.

I still like Carc: Hunters & Gatherers a bit more overall, especially for a larger group, but The Castle is a great 2 player edition. The scoring to snag bonus tiles adds a small tactical touch, and the ability to orient tiles in any fashion (as long as roads line up) is great. I don't see Reiner's touch on this, though -- there's nothing that smacks of RK's trademark wonky bizarrio math or scoring.

Really nice slick design.  I just love the way this plays.  Many people seem to hate the way the houses, castles, and court areas butt up against eachother in a rather un-Carcassonne-y way, leaving the roads as your primary placement limiter.  It doesn't bother me much, though.  I also love that the optimum play is often about very controlled scoring (to get the bonus tiles) as opposed to always trying to max your score.

Very nice desing by Reiner Knizia - taking Carcassonne and putting it into walls was ingenious.

A very nice game for two players. For a two player game it's still uses much of your table ;) A very good alternative for the great Carcassonne.

As far as two player Carcassonne goes, this is much preferred over the original and any of the other variants or expansions.  The new wall tiles and keep scoring is kind of interesting, but not enough to make it stand out compared to the rest.  Good for those that enjoy all things Carcassonne or wants a decent 2-player game, otherwise I recommend skipping it.

Got the german version of this game for ten bucks. Fun little carc variant. The castle adds a bit more strategy then I find in the other versions of this game. I like the power up tiles on the scoring track. Good quick twist on Carc. Only complaint is that the castle track seems a little flimsy and is hard to keep together.

Trust Knizia to take Carcassonne and add just a few bits of extra depth to it to make it so interesting and enjoyable to play.

It's [thing=822]Carcassonne[/thing] with added restrictions, liberties, and incentives.  You may opt to score a little less so your scoring watchman (hey, he walks on the castle wall, OK?) lands on a corner, nabbing a wall tile.  This could be a point bonus, or a rule-bending scoring of an incomplete building at the end of the game, or a number of other things.  Finally, somewhat like in Mexica, open, unestablished space at game end still gets awarded, so it should not be ignored.

I've used to play Carcassonne 1vs1 until I've got my hands on this one. I'd suggest buying The Castle over vanilla Carcassone if you intend to only play 1vs1.

After 2+ Games: Good to see the Carc franchise take a chance with a game that really changes the game system.  I like the originality, but I need more plays to see how it stands up to the others in the series.

I used to hate this game because I thought it un-did the fun things about Carcassonne: Vanilla. I tried it recently and it finally clicked with me...now I love it.

One of my new favorite two player games.  With the tiles only needing to match roads there are a tonne of possibilities to think about, and the bonus tiles on the scoring track are an excellent addition (though somewhat game-breaking at times)  I just can't pass up a game and my ex just can't beat me at it!

RATING: 5
4/7/08 - Well, I thought Reiner could save Carcassonne, but such a lofty goal was even too much for him.  The game has obvious improvements over the original in terms of infusing more "game" into the game, however, it's ultimately almost as boring as the original.  I applaud Reiner's humanitarian effort in trying to bring the dribble of a gaming franchise known as Carcassonne into some sort of respectable form, but this ultimately futile effort will not appease you, o lover-of-games, so avoid it in favor of whatever else is on your to-try list.

Dentro de un muro los jugadores deben colocar los tiles para ubicar a sus caballeros en las torres, heraldos en los caminos, siervos en los palacios y mercaderes en los mercados. Una de las novedades es que a lo largo del scoring track existen fichas de bonus que tendran un impacto fundamental en la puntuacion.

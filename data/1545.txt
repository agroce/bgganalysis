To me has same appeal as two player Carcassonne. You place tiles in your own little section of the board [isn't that what you do in Carcassonne most times?] and if you don't like the tile you get, may place it face-down on the opponent's side of the board to mess them up [three times per game].

Starting at 7, but I could see this rating go up.  It's a breezy, uncomplicated tile-placement game.  The rules are simple, the scoring pretty easy, and there are plenty of little placement puzzles to solve.  I look forward to a lot more plays of this.

Start out heavy in the center of the board and use your weeds to ensure that your opponent doesn't steal any of your flower patches there. A good light filler game.

After playing 1 game, I am thinking away from the game about the strategy to play the game.
I like the concept; the simplicity of laying tiles; and also the competitive strategy which must be employed to win.
I lost my first game... but this game is definately a winner as far as I'm concerned!

Solid 2 player abstract. Rules are simple, next to zero set up time, the game is relaxing, has luck of the draw but also has some placement skill.

Watch out for the printing error that happened with earlier editions. A double tile is missing and replaced with something else.

RATING: 4
pretty blah game of dominoes.  i think a tug of war scoring track, scoring as you go, would be both easier and better for the game.  the single tile draw out of the bag per turn is a bit too random, but perhaps the game could be improved with a hand.  ultimately i don't think it can be saved without making the whole board open and having real competition, but it wouldn't be the same game at all.  not a fan.

A very cute little game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
3rd best of the Kosmos 2-player games (after Blue Moon and Jambo). The solitaire variant is almost as good as the regular game. Everyone who plays this loves it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
We both are quite fond of competitive tile-laying puzzle games and a slavish buyers of the Kosmos 2-player range, so the early expectations were that this was a safe bet. It should have been an early warning that the reaction to our first game could only be typified as "thoroughly underwhelmed".

Usually, even games we dislike provoke some discussion. We hardly ever put a game back in the box without picking each other's brains to see if we would change anything to make it more to our liking, or discuss why it fell flat. This one did, and that is no good omen. To be frank, the solo version sounds like the more appealing way to play it, but even that hardly has me salivating at the prospect.

When I read the rules I checked the scoring several times. Surely they were kidding? A group of 3 would be the most efficient way to generate points from a group, unless you boosted it to a full 10! Even with perfect tiles, that 10th tile would generate 4 points in total, 1 more than 3 small groups of 3, and no doubt would come at the cost of inefficient positioning of the flowers on the other half of those tiles.  

In the endgame it is far too risky, in the medium game it can easily be sabotaged by 3 weed tiles, creating far more havoc than it is worth, and in the early game you really want to concentrate on gaining planting up terrain that adds to your score in the communal green, as it is the obvious area where differential scores can be gained, in what I presumed would be an utterly tight game.

To give the game it dues: yes, placement considerations are not trivial, as there certainly are clever and daft ways to go about it. There are sneaky ways to block and expand, and a few well-positioned weed spoiler-tiles on the opposite lawn can ruin several flower beds all at once. I actually suspect that this is exactly how games are won, by dropping the killer weed on an area where it hampers most scoring opportunities simultaneously.

Maybe we simply have had too much fun with the stacking element in Rat Hot, or the massive scoring consequences of tile positioning in games as Micropul, for our own good. Maybe the cut-throat interference, or interaction, depending on your playing style, with the flower bed creation of your opponent was just too limited for our liking. Maybe there were simply too many flower types for too large an area to get really careful about decisions. Whatever it was, overall game play has been far too pedestrian and repetitive to make this a likely candidate for our any of our cafe trips. 

I am sure the suggested and obvious scoring variant will make it a far better game. I even suspect that playing it on a smaller grid, and allowing players to alter bed composition by placing tiles on top of those already present would then add a whole new dimension to the game.

There is nothing in this game that makes me want to try that out, and whatever caused this, it is not an experience we have often, let alone about the same game. 

I suspect that what I am missing most is a sense of placement pressure. There are just too many self-averaging factors in play that make all the biodiversity add up to roughly the same result on your own turf. That leaves the all important opening moves quite possibly as the deciding factor between equally competent players, with lucky tile draw crucial in the phase where the central green is being carved up.

I can see how some people will click with this, tile placement games with a puzzle element tend to make easy converts and some people will truly appreciate the limited direct confrontation. Personally I'd rather sit down for a game of Ingenious, Zatre, or Sudoku Duell der Meister, that not only have less tiles in play, but do so much more with it, and thus trigger a far more interactive experience.

Another game in the Kosmos two player series where you are laying tiles with two different flowers depicted on them on the board while competing for space and trying to match them a la dominoes. The more of a single type of flower you connect, the greater your score for them at the end.

There is some strategy in the timing and positioning of the tiles to negate your opponent victory points and space on the board, but once learned it could be played as a relaxing pastime. Simple rules for a simple game.

Really fun, very attractive game, but the scoring seems out of wack.  As someone else stated, it does seem like the optimal strategy is planting small beds of 3 flowers, which isn't anywhere near as fun as planting larger beds.  So, we go for the larger beds anyway!  Since I'm a girl, I don't mind it being a "girl" game...LOL!

Reminds me of Ingenius.  I enjoy this one...one of the better Kosmos 2-Player games I own.  The key is to get the gardens planted in 3's and 6's.  If you have a shot for a 10 garden, great.  If you miss on it, you lose valuable points.

This game suffers from having no incentive to build flower patches > 3.  At 3 flowers / patch, you get 1/3 point/ flower.  The only possible way to beat that ratio is to get 10 flowers (1 point / 2.5 flowers), which is really tough.

Surprisingly fun game that's sadly out of print. At first your decisions seem arbitrary as you place flowers out with no knowledge of what's coming next, but as the game continues you suddenly find yourself faced with lots of possibilities, some good, most less-than-optimal. Trying to block your opponent might end up actually helping them, and building large regions can actually make the surrounding regions smaller.

A perfect game after shopping for florists.  Creating large gardens that border each other is almost impossible because of the lack of similar tiles.  Scoring is always low.  We find that we don't like playing with the weed beds.  If this game becomes too competitive we don't tend to enjoy it.  Generally we enjoy the puzzle aspect most with this game.

RATING: 6
Light tile laying game. Tiles depicting one or two flower varieties are drawn from a bag and positioned on a game board. Players are trying to arrange the tiles to form large flower beds of like varieties of flowers. The larger the flower bed, the more points are scored. Pleasant game, and very attractive. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The weed rule makes this a bit nastier than it appears.  Otherwise it's a pleasant double-solitaire plus some interesting interactions in the shared zone in the middle.  I'm not entirely convinced that the scoring table is optimal; I haven't tried Chris Brua's variant (see his article on this page) but it might work better.

I find the game takes too long for the amount of enjoyment I get from it.  There is some strategy to the game but there is also the luck of which tiles you draw.  When I play this I feel like I'm playing an abstract strategy  and it is, however the luck involved ruins that feeling and I just consider this a tile laying game.  Why not just play an abstract strategy that I do enjoy rather than this?  What's more bothersome is that this was expensive since it's rare.

Ingenious with flowers. Rare Kosmos 2 player tile placement and area control game that can be peaceful or cutthroat. Draw a tile, place the tile, and attempt to get large patches of flowers and score points according to the score table. There is a neutral strip in the middle of the board where flowers can count for you if the majority ends up on your side of the garden. 3 times during the game you can use your tiles as weeds to plant in your opponent's garden usually trying to cut them off from expansion. Fight over dominance over the central strip is inevitable at some point. Feels similar to Ingenious but different enough that we are keeping both. The small board and tiny tiles are adorable and portable. Loved it from the first time we played it, still love it today.

* Played 2 times. Complaints that 3-plant beds are best way to score are true, so I propose bumping each score up by one: 0-2 = 0, 3-5 = 1, 6-9 = 3, 10+ = 5. Quite dry game with artwork you may loathe. Interesting challenge from the middle of the game on. I'd like this game more except for the graphics which remind me of my grandma's china. If it were space alien heads, I'd probably love it.

Underrated and far more skill than meets the eye. This one has really grown on me. Like Take It Easy, it has an interesting puzzle element. Play without the weeds for less confrontation and, I reckon, a better game. Playing with weeds discourages players from aiming for the 10-size beds and actually detracts from one's options and the level of enjoyment

Flowerpower er i mine øjne tæt på at virke som et ikke-spil. Det er højst uengagerende for mig at spille. Bevares der er via det fælles areal og muligheden for at placere 3 ukridtsbede på modstanderens halvdel nogle begrænsede muligheder for at interagere. Og hvis man er i humør til at tælle brikker, kan man da også regne på sandsynligheden for at få fat i de rigtige brikker. Hvor jeg generelt syntes at niveauet er højt blandt Kosmos' to-spillers spil syntes jeg, at Flowerpower falder igennem. Ikke anbefalelsesværdigt.

Flowerpower suffers from the syndrome of a game that does not really begin until about 2/3 of the way through once you've built out your board. Of course, the DMZ and the weed tiles make for a little more direct interaction but it felt pretty inconsequential when the scores are tallied.

Not a bad litle game! Players take turn placing domino-like flower tiles on the board. With each player's half of the board being separated by a three row wide common zone, the game has plenty of confrontation.

Not really my kind of game, I suppose, but a solid implementation nevertheless. Possibly something to play with the family?

RATING: 6
Gentle game with a stately pace.  Similar in feel to dominos, but more intriguing.  To me, it takes about 15 minutes too long for what it is.  I prefer the variant scoring of 1/3/6 as it aligns the optimal strategy with the fun task of building big beds.

Contemplative tile-laying game for couples that don't want much confrontation, i.e. situations where Carcassonne is too mean. Not much here for strategy gamers but it's enjoyable although not worth the premium prices it fetches on Ebay nowadays.

RATING: 7
Cute two-player game about planting flowerbeds. Nothing deep, similar to drawing and placing dominoes but with the amount of flexibility in placememnt it is hard to declare a drawn tile to ever be bad. Almost a solitaire game if not for the common middle ground and the weed rules, which offer limited ability to screw your opponent. Perfect for playing with my non-gamer wife.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A very relaxing, lazy type of game that is almost better off as a background activity, not thinking too hard about what you're doing.  The theme is pretty thin, but the game is still moderately challenging - it seems like small flower beds are more important than you would think.

LIKE:

* Pleasant diversion with a little bit of tactics to maintain interest.
* Very simple game - pick a tile and play.  Three times a game you play a tile upside down as a weed to mess with your opponent.
* The most significant part of the game is likely battling over the neutral field and seeing if you can steal an opponent's set from them but that can prove difficult.
* The finished mosaix is quite colorful.

DISLIKE:

* Well, there really isn't much there as far as game goes - and you are somewhat at the mercy of the tile draw.

A solid, attractive game that gets bonus points because both my wife & daughter enjoy playing it with me. Say what you want about the girly flower theme . . . and then wonder why we've got so few women in our hobby, yet so many games about orcs and tanks. I'm just saying.

Meanwhile, Flowerpower is a cool placement & pattern-building tile game, one that offers a nice mix of nonconfrontation (play on your side of the board) with just a dash of possible nastiness (you can play against your opponent three times during the game). The sharky gamers will realize that the game is won or lost in the contested middle ground.

Enjoyable two player tile placement game.  Most of the game is a solitaire optimization puzzle wherein you're trying to place each tile in a way to form orthogonal chains of like-flowers.  Where the game shines, however, is the middle of the board that is shared between the two players and since space is very valuable it can be used to expand your gardens, take over other gardens (hard to do) or block your opponent.  Additionally, you can use two of your moves to place an overturned tile in your opponents garden creating a dead space.  These weeds should be placed to block the growth of your opponents chains (or keep him from connecting two chains).  The timing and placement of the weed actions are key to winning against a worthy gardening foe.

Two player abstract. You're trying to increase the size of your flower beds, to get to certain sizes. You can block your opponent by placing weeds in his garden, but you only have this option three times. The best thing is not to concentrate on only large fields, getting one large and more small or medium fields is probably a better approach.

Wonderful! An awesome 2-player experience! One day this will and should be reprinted (Z-man will probably do it) because it is a game unique and like no other. It's a simple game of placing small flower tiles and creating sets of matching flowers. It's relaxing to play...a perfect week night game and not very cutthroat. The weeds are a bit touchy...but they are fun to place! I love the board, tiles and scoring track...the game is one perfect little package!

RATING: 7
A very peaceful spouse game. The game begins by playing to the shared middle section to claim as much of it as you can, followed by playing tiles to your half of the board, trying to complete flowerbed sets of 3 (or 6 or 10) in each of the 10 flowers. Three times in the game you can play a disruptive "weed" tile on your opponent's board. It can be played in a trance (pick a tile, play a tile) but it does actually reward for you continual counting of each flower to help determine the odds of getting what you need to complete a set on the board. It's deceptive that way, and you get out of it what you put into it.

Good SO/kid game with enough there for the gamer.  I prefer the BGG variant in which only each players largest beds in each variety are scored, or the variant scoring where 1-2=0, 3-4=1, 5-6=2, 7-8=3, 9 =4, so a clump of nine is worth one point more than three clumps of three.

This is a fairly mindless tile-laying filler game.  I wish this had a more graduated scoring system.  As it is, creating a 6-set is worth the same as creating 2 3-sets (so why bother?), and creating a 10-set is usually easily prevented by an opponent who hasn't fallen asleep.  So optimal play really is just creating groups of 3 everywhere.  If the game had increasing rewards for creating groups of 4 through 9, I think this would be a much more interesting game.

I just located a new copy of this and I'm looking forward to playing it. I'll come back and assign a real rating afterwards.

Update, 12/27/2013. So I finally got my copy today (obtained via eBay from S. Korea, new and in perfect condition) and played my first game with my daughter. It's pretty damn fun!

I think the criticism leveled at the scoring system is unfounded. We found that it was actually *harder* to form separate groups of three then building upon existing groups and expanding them, so why change it to award even more points for large single groups? The scoring system seems well balanced the way it is. No need to second guess the designers who undoubtedly had way more play test games than any of us have had post-published games.

A good light game.  Played several times and find it without a lot of replayability.  Very little negative interaction (weeds) in play make for a good introduction to young and new gamers.

Shouldn't be dismissed as a game for children. Yes, there's a lot of luck involved, but the key to winning has to do with claiming the neutral zone. I played about 20 games in a row with my (adult) sister-in-law and the winning strategy really became apparent: claim that middle area, force your opponent to waste squares on his/her side of the board, and rack up points at the end when your opponent can no longer place tiles!

RATING: 4
This can be a rather frustrating game if you think that clever play will win the game for you.  Mostly, you are just leaving yourself open, biding time, hoping to draw the right tiles.  But, there is some stuff going on the in the center that makes the game kind of entertaining, but mostly you just use it to make threes and block people from making them.  It feels a little long for what it is, it probably could have used one less flower and two fewer rows on the outside.

I'd play it to kill time, but there really isn't a whole lot of depth here.  It is easy enough to have a conversation over though, for those that want games as residual experiences.

UPDATE: This really is a boring game.  I've downgraded my rating.  It seems that you should just go for threes over and over again - it is the easiest return.  Blah.

The more I play this, the more I love it. It plays quickly, offers tough choices, and has just a touch of nastiness to spice it up.

With more plays, you find out how useful and interesting that center area is. You can use it to extend a scoring block, or you can throw junk in there so you aren't using up your side or to block your opponent who is using it to extend their scoring block.

A lot of this game depends on how well you tend your own garden, getting things to match up in a somewhat organized fashion as you cope with the flow of the luck of the draw, and I find that part of the game engrossing.  But there's also the question of dealing with the neutral zone effectively, and then there are those all-important weeds, the three tiles of direct attack which can make the difference in a close game.  A wonderfully simple yet solid game.

It's a bit deeper than you would initially think, as there are many strategies and ways to play to try to ensure you score your flowers.  And that's before even flipping the tile over and playing it in your opponent's space as weeds.

10-JUN-2009 - Well, apparently my wife is not unbeatable on this game. My mom and I have both won against her, but she consistently seems to win more than we do. We still enjoy playing this game and seem to be playing it fairly frequently.
-----------------
Despite it's apparent similarities to dominos, there is more to it than that IMO. You must play both strategically and tactically, you can mess with the other person a little bit in a couple of different ways, plus, there's a good sprinkling of luck in your draws. This is also somewhat mitigated by the neutral area (green strip) in the middle of the board where you have a lot of options on different possible tactics. The games are always close and the tension definitely builds as the game goes on. I have yet to win against my wife.

Gets too repeative with subsequent plays but if played now and then, it's a very good two-player game.

Simple 2 person game that isn't so much about screwing the other player as building on your own.

Very manly. A testosterone-filled gardening fiesta. This one is actually a fun tile-laying game, though often the luck of tile draws can make it far more frustrating than would seem possible given the theme.

Very simple, clever game. Surprised that the tiles aren't equally distributed (one flower does not have a double tile). Seems like a good game for couples.

Flowerpower is THE out-of-print holy grail for men trying to seduce their women into the hobby of board gaming.  It's fun, but not worth the current German import going rate.

A little bit over rated...but that is in my under rated opinion.

A small peek beneath the skirt was all it took to reveal that the hype surrounding this one,  was as hollow as a cheap chocolate Easter Bunny in shiny colored tin foil.  Perhaps,  that was the reason my level of disappointment was so high. It can be a relaxing experience,  but rarely did it beckon from the game shelf. 

Later,  when it began to fetch market prices that closely resembled a small ransom,  it germinated in another direction.

Tile-laying tranquility with a mean streak.  Not too much to think about, but it's a quick play with some tension on the draw.  The shared central area and flipped tiles allow for some aggressive play.

Nice gateway for two, especially those drawn in by the theme.  Artwork and components are nice, if not fantastic.

I was pretty sure my wife would like this game, and I was right. She likes tile-laying games. Plus, there is minimal screwage (but there IS some), and the theme is attractive. Also, it plays in about half an hour, all of which add up to a positive experience. I must admit I like it as well. Interesting that it was not picked up by an English publisher. I think it is better than many others in the Kosmos two-player line that WERE published in English.

Decent game, but I don't see the fuss of over "my female companion will play this".  My GF liked it okay, but it didn't bowl her over.

This is effectively dominoes with flowers replacing the numbers.  The goal is to build sting of flowers to score points.  The tension, which I didn't understand at first is the middle of the board which is shared.  The player owned areas are insufficient.  Play until no one can play anymore and then score you chains.

It's a tile-laying game, so a lot of what you're trying to do is limited by the draw, but I think that your placement of tiles dictates your choices, as well.  It's an abstract game, too, but it's not bad.  The communal area in the middle of the board makes the game more interesting, and there are surprisingly interesting ways to mess with your opponent.

There's a neat balancing mechanism with the values of the gardens based on size, in that you can go for a 6-garden and a 4-garden for 3 points, or hope that your opponent won't plant a weed on you so you can get 4 points off a 10-garden instead.  If they cut you off at nine, though, you lose what could have been a 1 point 3-garden.  But if your opponent keeps drawing tiles they want to use for themselves, they might not want to waste it on planting a weed.  How far do you want to push your luck?

The game IS dry, and it tends to draw out past its 30-minute time frame, but it's worth having.  It has some of the same challenge as Rosenkoenig, and also the same sort of feel to it.  They're both worthy 2-player games.

Nice 30 minute tile laying game that is kind of like playing dominoes. The gameboard and game components really make the flower theme come true. Maybe not the deepest game out there, which by the way it doesn't pretend to be, but certainly a fun one.

Pretty good little 2 player tile-laying game.  Try to get the biggest plots of each flower type.  Quick, light fun.  And the flowers are nice.

A light, slightly strategic, flower planting game. A very enjoyable 2 player game with enough randomness, that every game is unique. Every choice made in the previous moves, dictates your new strategy in the current and later moves.

Have played several games with people. I like this, although it is not terribly exciting until near the end. It is a nice game to play with my wife. 
UPDATE: I have played this with a bunch of new gamers and this gets a suprising amount of love. My wife want to play this until I am sick of it. I have discovered there is more tension early in the game as we now fight over the green belt much more than initially.

Flowerpower isn't a bad game at all.  In fact, I can see why it would have a wide appeal, and it isn't hard to teach to a non-gaming partner either.  However, two things really irk me in terms of the design.  First is the disparity in the points awarded.  It is true the larger the plots, the higher the score you will receive for them, but is it really efficient?  Considering you only get 1 more point by extending a bed of three flowers to six, which is exactly the same as creating two sets of threes, wouldn't you save more tiles and spaces by doing the latter?  Sure the points jump to 4 if you can manage to build a plot to ten, but how many other sets would you have sacrificed to accomplish that?  Not to mention there aren't that many tiles to begin with, I bet it feels real good to see your plan go to waste when the game ends with you one short, robbing you 2 points (or maybe more).

Then there is the fact that you can go through the game almost entirely solitaired.  The weed tiles are an ok implementation against that, but unless they are placed exceptionally well, my feeling is they are nothing but a minor nuisance.  Of course the experienced players would understand the importance of playing to the neutral zone often and early, as a way to keep their side open and uncluttered towards the end, but there is no guarantee the other person would play competitively and simply ignore your advances by blocking them off with unmatching flowers.  To me a 2-player only game should have a degree of cutthroat to it that is unavoidable.

This is a pleasant little tile laying game in which you try to make significant contiguous groups of flower types.  Deciding when to cut off your groups is an interesting choice, based on the opportunities and the scoring breakdown.  Manage your own little garden, sort of.

After 1 Play: Enjoyable, but I would have enjoyed it more if there was more interaction.  Each player has their own garden that is immune to the actions of their opponent.  There is a no-man's-land in the middle where the real competition takes place.  I just wish this area was a little bigger.

One of our favourites, mainly because the wife's interest in tile laying and flowers. Tile laying is relaxing (see Carcassonne).
